1,"Conan The ""Emo"" Barbarian","Why paint his eyes black?Emo look ruined it for me. The movie was bad and really was a wasted reboot/remake (just like every other lately). Hollywood should stop looking for the past and look ahead, so many creative minds and Hollywood wastes their time doing remakes which bomb for the most part. Conan The ""Emo"" Barbarian sucks!"
3,Worth it to watch just for Leo Howard's (young Conan) scenes!,"Alright, the movie wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst I've ever seen.... it was OK. Good action... a little gory at times. Of course, Jason Mimoa is gorgeous! I guess the acting by all was about the best it could be for this type of movie. I MUST MENTION, THOUGH, THAT LEO HOWARD WHO PLAYED YOUNG CONAN IS FANTASTIC! I knew nothing about him but, when watching the movie, I felt that he must have had some martial arts training.... I googled him and sure enough he started training when he was 4... and is a champion. That kid is bad-@#$ss and it showed! I think great things are in store for him. One thing I really didn't like about the movie was the gratuitous nudity that wasn't necessary to the plot... but, I guess guys won't watch a movie without it????! The movie makers sure seem to think so.... Overall, the movie was better than I had expected it to be and I think it's worth watching for the fun of it!"
3,"not bad, but where is arnie when you need him.","Ive been a big fan of conan for a long time. movie is pretty good, 3d is average. dosent hold up to the original movie."
2,Typical modern Hollywood fantasy action garbage,"I thought (..or perhaps optimistically hoped) Hollywood was beyond the likes of craptastic fantasy action films like The Scorpion King & Kull the Conqueror. Conan proves otherwise, as a thin storied action driven film laced with bad dialogue and 'pretty' half-actors wedged into poorly written roles. Its sad that Hollywood can continue to so badly drop the ball with this genre (...and in general) while CABLE TV NETWORKS like HBO churn out a quality product like Game of Thrones. What's even worse, is that this movie did so poorly that we'll be lucky to see another shot taken at such a great property (Conan).<edit>Allow me to retract my initial statement about Hollywood being beyond such films, as I recall seeing the tragedy that was a bundle of wasted $ : Prince of Persia. I can still hold out hope that some portion of Hollywood has quality fantasy films to offer us, after all Peter Jackson is working on The Hobbit."
1,Putrid,"It's obvious that the only thing Conan like, in this movie is the Name. Comics are fantasy, but not absurd. He spends over half the movie flirting with the ingenue, He's a Barbarian for gosh sakes, not some simpering swain. She dispatches bad guys with aplomb, and then spends 50 minutes screaming, in one dangerous situation after another. No matter where they are, ship, forest, or hovel, the (bad guys), are always there. The 1293 gory deaths are O.K.,but,too fast to follow, but the sets are neat. The 3-D effects were weird, the things that are supposed to come out of the screen, don't. I love 3-D, and I just hate see this kind of tripe, in this medium. It gives 3-D critics, fodder for their antipathy."
2,I gave it a shot and I pretty much regretted it.,"Was in the mood to watch and action flick, just wanted a descent dude movie, decided to rent it.Yeah this is not a very good movie.Cons:Bad acting(Even for the genre)Not amazing special effectsNot that much blood(Its Conan right?)CheesyZero depth and imagination on the storyPros:None...(Some might argue it has a few chest shots in it)Overall...This movie to me was a complete waste, aside that I spend only a buck to watch it, my overall thoughts where I just wasted how much of my life watching this movie? Save your time and watch a different action movie. Special effects where sub par same with the gore...its an action movie, we expect little in the way of story so the effects and gore need to be there, but it failed at that to me.Why remake a movie if your are going to do it worse?...just my thoughts."
2,Lackluster direction and hackneyed plot,"While I enjoyed most of the acting the final script was scattered and stereotypical and the direction was so lackluster that one comes away from this film just not caring about the characters or their challenges and without really feeling like the world of REH's Hyborian Age was brought to life.This should have at least been a fun action film (I never really expected a good REH adaptation) but instead it ended up boring me to where I was waiting for it to be over. If I wasn't interested in being fully informed as to the merits of the film, and the lack thereof, I would have turned it off and done something else for the last 30 minutes."
2,Not as bad as I was told!,"Ok, so they had a script lying around and decided that putting ""Conan"" on would sell the movie. I get it. It is ashamed because, while they are not great literature, R.E. Howard wrote some good stories that could have been good movies. Instead we get generic stories with wooden acting. Momoa = Schwarzenneger in terms of acting ability. Movie was not very visually interesting. Nothing was particulalry ""wow"" worthy in the Hyborian world as presented. Music was good but not great. Rent it cheap if you want to see it."
1,Abomination,"Quite simply an abomination. A disgrace to the legacy of Robert E Howard! Robert is not merely rolling in his grave, he has drilled through the other side of the earth and reached escape velocity!"
1,Save your money. Watch the original Conan or some Game of Thrones,"No amount of money could save this poor attempt at remaking the magic of the original. Jason Momoa is better suited to grunting as Drogo than trying to be Conan.Swords, a lot of screaming, even more fake-board-break-throughs, and some impractical armor don't make a fantasy movie a success.This film needs to sit next to the re-interpretations of The Phantom, The Shadow, and any of the Highlander sequels. The writing is on par with them as is most of the acting."
2,"Nispel,you just don't have it","Really thought this would be an entertaining flick,for a drunken night out with the crew.Actually 3 out of 5 guys fell asleep and the only reason I stayed awake was a group of equally bored girls next to us.The movie simply lacks the charm of the old Schwarzenegger ones.Nispel always fails to create an atmosphere that can put up with the originals.He somehow manages to make every movie look like it was done by 'directing unit 7'. If you liked movies like Pathfinder or 10 000 BC;you probably like this one to."
4,Conan the Barbarian,"I also have the original one and I have always liked it,but this one is a lot better,every thing about it beat's the first one.Acting story filming everything.I am glad I have it."
1,still waiting,"Don't know about the rest of you, but I'm still waiting for a Conan movie. I've read all the paperbacks by R. Howard and the only things I recognize are some of characters names and him being born on battlefield. Just as good as other movies I've suffered through, but glad I borrowed it before buying."
4,2D or Not 2D?,"I liked the movie, but I can see where others may not. I bought the 3D version because I am addicted to 3D. The 3D in this film did not satisfy my hunger. There were two, maybe three, places where you would say... ""That looks cool""! That was it. Most of it didn't even look like it was filmed in 3D.So if the 3D version cost more... don't buy it! The Blu Ray will give you the same amount of entertainment"
3,poor quality!,It came well wrapped and in a timely manner as is typical for Amazon.I have two DVD copies of these films (because I am too spoiled to get off the couch and turn over the 2 sided disc in my DVD carousel).The pictue and sound on these BDs are both superior to the DVDs. Problem is that my BD carousel does not like the second (Destroyer)disc very much. I have to load it many times before the disc player accepts it.
3,Conan,Not bad - some nice sequences in it but not much of a story. Ron P is only ever going to act as Ron P!
2,Ugh...wht happened to Hollywood writers?,"This is a horrible way to re-spark the Conan saga. I thought that Jason Momoa was great in his role as Khal Drogo in ""The Game of Thrones"" and that would have been a great way portray Conan, but I'm afraid this Conan movie is a little too soft. Like most movie re-makes, the story was a bit weak. I think that if the writers had stayed true to the Conan graphic novels/comics, it could have had brutal potential. The acting left much to be desired and the fight scenes were so complex, they seemed staged. Brutality folks! That's all a Conan movie needs. Better luck next time."
3,This should have been so much better...,"How is it possible to make a movie this lack luster with so many good people in it and so much obviously put into it? This Conan isn't Howard's Conan, but it could have been worth watching. I only made it about 45 minutes into it before stopping. I wasn't disgusted with, just wasn't really into it. Oh well, back to waiting to see if anyone out there can do Howard's Conan justice (I'd also settle for Bran Mak Morn.)"
2,Started off somewhat strong then...,I had an idea of what this movie was going to be before I watched it and i was right. It started off pretty strong for me. I enjoyed watching the first 30 minutes. But after the lead character grew into adulthood the movie became unwatchable. Poor acting...poor writing...very predictable ending.
2,Not as good as the origional,"I agree with some, the opening chase scene is pretty cool. But, the rest was just bad. Bad acting, unlikeable characters..."
2,...................,"This movie was type casting at its worse, by type casting, I mean casting a big guy who can arch his eyebrows for every other close up scene. I watched the old ""Conan the Barbarian"" with Arnold and I didnt really like those either, but this movie was..... I lost count on how many times ""Conan"" Made a ""Aargh"" sound and twirled his sword and threw it in the ground...... Why? For one it dulls the sword and it doesnt look cool at all. I do not know the production budget of his movie but some of the ""CGI"" scenes were pretty crappy. The only reason why I gave this movie two stars, was because the of the first fight scene when Conan was a Kid, it was pretty bad a$$. So for a even shorter Summary: ""Aargh"", arching eyebrows, posesing with the sword, constantly ending up shirtless and a corny ending. There you have it."
4,A Spiritual Adventure,"Great Book! A friend recommended this book to me and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The Link contains a perfect blend of action and spirituality. The authors ideas about the possible links between two of the worlds major religions are thought provoking and intriguing. It teaches us to look beyond what we have been conditioned to believe and to explore other possibilities with respect to the world and religion. I loved the surprise ending - it had a very interesting twist. Life is a journey and the answers are in each of us, we only have to be curious and look! Read this book, and open your mind to new possibilities!"
5,Captivating,I was hooked the second I began reading! Thoroughly inticing! I think this new-comer has a very bright future ahead of him.
1,"fine for data, but don't use for music","These disks work fine for data, but I've never been able to get them to work for music at ANY speed. They either skip or don't play at all. I've not had the same problems with media from other companies."
1,Memorex cd-r white label / green disks nothing but trouble.,"I bought a 50 disk spindle of the Memorex 700 mb/80 minute cd-r's (white label, green disks) and have had nothing but trouble with them. They seem to play ok on my computer but when I try them in other players they either will not play at all, or they wind up sounding like a scratched record. They get stuck and play the same phases over and over again like the old records use to do and you often can't change tracks with them. I thought at first that it was my brand new HP cd-writer, but using Maxell or Verbatim cd-r's produce great quality reproductions; so it is definately these disks. Many of the people doing the rating here are rating the black disks, which I haven't, and do not intend, to try. One of the reviewers said they got a big rebate with these things; I'm not surprised. My advice is that unless the rebate is substancially more then the purchase price - steer clear."
1,Do not use these for music,"The ""silver"" or white CDs with the blue packaging do not work for music. That's why they are so cheap. Only one of my CD players could read these burned discs at all and for the short time that the player played the disc, it was garbled and full of static. I made a lot of coasters trying to get one right and tried many different recording speeds and settings. All produced the same result. And since other CD-Rs have worked, I know it is not my computer system or my players. (Note if you go to Memorex's web site, they have discs labeled specifically for music and these are not them!)"
2,Visibly poor quality,"I was very disappointed with these discs. Only about 1 in 5 would work at all in my one burner. Although most of them will work to some extent in my newer burner, many of the discs have visible flaws near the edge and will fail if written to their capacity. I've learned that it is worth it to purchase only blanks made in the US or Japan."
2,Um 40X? Not really...,I was under the impression that 40X means that they can be written at 40X spped. My Drive (which is a 40X LiteOn) will only write them at 12X and Nero says it's only a 12X disc? Is this false advertising on Memorex's part??? Any ideas??Good price though..but I like the Staples Gold better(Store brand of a sony I think) and they write at 40x ..
1,stay away from these,"I have a Song CDRX700E 8x burner for my Dell notebook. About half of this Memorex spindle wound up in the garbage due to buffer underruns and garbled audio. I was convinced it was my burner or my computer that was causing the problem, but I when I switched to TDKs all my problems disappeared. Stay away from these CDs!!Also, the large bright purple logo on the disk shows right through the white CD labels--yet another reason to switch to the all-white TDKs."
1,Bigger is NOT better...,"I don't know why everyone has gone to the 80 minute cd-r/cd-rw. They are much worse than the 74 minute 650 MB cds. Data is kept more reliably on 650 meg cds. On the 700 meg cds, the tracks are much narrower, and generally don't comply with orange book standards. Data on 700 meg cds have a much higher tendency to become corrupt compared to 650 meg cds. Older CD readers (any kind, including audio players) couldn't read these cds at all. Unless it is absolutely necessary, I would highly suggest 650 meg cds. There is more information on brands and quality here:http://freetechsupport.freeservers.com/resource/cdr/index.html"
1,Product Faulty,After 16 man-hours of trying to back up three different computers with Veritas Backup Exec Pro v4.5 and Exec v4.2 on Pentium IV 1.7gig Windows 2000 Plexwriter 16/10/40A CDRW and Pentium III 700mhz Windows 98 Sony 10/4/32 CDRW and after uninstalling/installing software I found that the problem was with the Memorex disks. Pop in Sony 1x-16x 700mb disk and the backup works just fine. I purchased 150 of these Memorex disks from Amazon (not your fault) that I now can not use. Bad product Memorex!
5,A good serious,This is a very funny book with a bit of romance on the side. I highly recommend this book and all the other Psychic Academy manga.
3,Good Info But Product Performance Evaluation Lacking,"On the plus side, this book provides a great recap regarding the environmental impacts of everyday household products, although the book sometimes reads like a chemistry textbook. The authors cite numerous research examples that demonstrate links between common products we use and their environmental and health effects. They also offer many common sense changes for improving our home's environment.My disappointment lies with the author's evaluations of readily-available cleaning products (which incidentally comes in the final chapter of the book). My past experiences with green cleaning products have been underwhelming at best -- performance is clearly lacking. The authors choose to evaluate over 300 products based only on the environmental impacts and specifically state that they did not evaluate cleaning performance -- a serious omission in their research. It feels like a job only half done."
3,Not really what I expected,"Naturally Clean: The Seventh Generation Guide to Safe & Healthy, Non-Toxic CleaningI was looking for a book that would have some recipes or formulas for home made cleaning products. This book only has a couple. They mostly suggested things to buy. Lots of info if you want to know how to make your home a less chemical environment."
5,Born to be Blue,"As a young GI in Germany in the early sixties I bought this album (then in vinyl) in the PX in Heidelberg. It was an amazing find and became one of my few treasures. Knocking about Europe, then the south of the US and finally Vietnam, Ms. Phillips remained a companion and a treasure. Alas, somewhere, on some move she was lost. Imagine the thrill when I found Born to be Blue had been re-released on CD. MY favorite track (hell they are all favorites really) is Easy Street. Buy this remarkable while you can. It's only wonderful!"
4,Acom works well for me,"I bought this drive for my Dell Inspiron 8100. It has USB 1.1 (useless for this) and a 4 pin Firewire which is how I connect. I use backup image software for protection and had no place to back it up. While hibernate and sleep mode will sometimes cause the drive not to be seen, it is easily remedied by either rebooting or unplugging and replugging in the firewire port. I also connected an external DVD burner through the firewire interface and copy my backups to disk. I've had the drive over a year and so far so good. I've already gotten my money worth as I had to restore my image a few months ago and all worked well!This works well enough so I am buying another Acom (160 gigs) for additional storage."
2,Beware the rebate!,The drive is a competent but not speedy performer on the firewire side using a PC. Benchmark performance on Sandra was 15% - 20% off optimal. I have not used the USB interface. ACOMDATA failed to pay out its rebate offer despite three phone calls and a letter to corporate. I gave up at that point. They won't get by business again.
2,PC can't detect the product so I can't use it.,"I tried five times to make this product work on my XP Pro Dell laptop and, despite following Acomdata's directions explicitly each time, I could not get the PC to detect the product. The external hard drive sounded really quiet, but what good is it if my PC doesn't know it's there? Acomdata FAQ was no help in this situation, and the email support was no help either. This company seems to be operating support on a shoestring. I almost feel sorry for them, except tomorrow I have to drive back to the same store and wait in the long Xmas exchange line (so I feel more sorry for myself)."
3,"Worked for awhile, but not anymore.","I bought this hard drive about a year and a half ago and it worked just fine. It never gave me any problems. Now, just a day ago, my computer suddenly stops recognizing it. I turn it on, and I don't get that ""new hardware found"" message that would always show up. I tried hooking it up to 5 other computers, but they wouldn't recognize it either! I've lost so much data because of this. I'm a graphic designer and I lost thousands of pictures and other projects I've been working on. Now I need to find a new hard drive to use. I know I won't stick with AcomData. I plan on getting a Seagate drive. Only this time I'll be smart enough to back up my files on CD's as well."
1,Very Disappointing,"Very disappointing. Very cheaply made, on/off button broke within 15min. of using this. I would not recommend even though this has been a childhood favorite for years."
2,Great if you want pegs flying everywhere.,"I was so excited to see that my daughter had received a Lite Brite for Christmas. I loved it as a child and, knowing her, I thought it would be a perfect fit for her. Until the pegs started flying every where. That alone would make me discourage any parent from purchasing this thing. As I type, my daughter's twin sister is on the floor, picking them up after another failed attempt at opening the peg drawer. The drawer sticks and once you finally get it open, you have to do so with such force, which causes the pegs to fly everywhere. The girls have been playing with it for a week now and I would be more than happy to see this thing accidentally land in the donation pile. Also, there are not enough sheets provided in the kit to keep my daughter entertained, and she's already gone through all of them."
2,NOT Your Classic Lite Brite,"I LOVED Lite Brite as a kid and played it for hours well into my teen years creating new designs and using the templates. So when I saw this for my kids (ages 4 & 7), I was very excited.First the screen is about half the size as the original, the pegs are much chunkier and the pictures are simple. It seems to be a 'kiddie' version of the original. My kids took turns playing it and they spent about 10 minutes each before they got bored and never returned. They love crafts, puzzles, spin art & spirographs, so I thought this would be a hit. When they applied pressure to put the pegs in, it fell over. The button was difficult to push and the light was dim and did not stay on during play (only a few short minutes). The drawer was too hard to open and I had to use so much force, I thought I was going to break it - it did not break, but the pegs went flying.Anyway, If I find an original at a yard sale, I may buy it, but would not spend any amount of money on this cheap rip-off."
1,how in the heck do you get the pegs out??????,"my daughter has used it once and I am ready to throw it in the trash.. first of all it came with some pictures but didnt even come with enough of the required colors to finish the most basic picture.. but .. the worst think is how do you get the pegs out.. i have pulled a couple out over the last week and I am ready to give up, some of them are so close together I cant get my fingers in there to pull any out.. it is so hard she is no longer even interested. waste of money"
1,Lite Brite.... what have you done...,First of all if you are thinking of buying this toy... don't. The previous version was great. This new slimline one is junk. Once you play with it you cannot get the pegs out without a lot of hard work!It took me nearly 20 mins with the help of a set of pliers to pull out all the pegs. The old version didn't require adult assistance this one does.DO NOT BUY.Find something else. If your kids cannot take out the pegs by themselves this is going to be a lot of work for you!THE PEGS DONT COME OUT WITHOUT ADULT ASSISTANCE!DO NOT BUY and if you do at least you were warned!On a positive note - i don't see this thing breaking any time soon and it is cheap. Cheap but not good.
2,Don't make em' like they used to.,"Lot of changes compared to the old lite brite. Alot smaller and compact which was somewhat of a plus. Dosen't use Electricity which I was always afraid I would get a shock as a kid. However there are some drawbacks.The ""Convienent"" peg holder wasn't convinenent at all and caused pegs to fly about as soon as it was opened. The 3 minute timer to the push button seemed inconvienent as well, It would have been better with a traditional On/off switch.One plus is that you can still use the construction paper trick should you run out of sheets. So that's a plus as well."
1,Not your childhood lite brite,"I was very disappointed in the quality and sturdiness of this toy. They are now battery operated and after turning the unit on, the bulb fades out after 3 minutes, (to conserve battery life). We had to keep turning the unit on, over and over just to finish one picture. The pointed pegs are shorter and do no stay in the holes. The paper sits on the outside of the unit and relies on the pegs to keep it in place. The overall quality of this Lite Brite compared to the childhood toy that you remember is not there. I cannot recommend this toy for any reason.Additionally, my 5-year-old and I finished one picture before he was bored with it and ready to go back to his Legos or Galactic Heroes, which he plays with for hours."
3,"What happened to the old fashioned Lite Brite with the large, angled screen?","I was just doing some research for my book about toys that develop good fine-motor skills and thought I would add Lite Brite to the list of toys that put the wrist in a good extended position as the pegs are pushed into the vertical screen. Now all I can find on the site is flat screens that look like computer games. These will not develop the same manipulation skills. Pushing the pegs into the vertical screen develops wrist strength and stability and motor control. Yes, the child still has to grasp these little pegs using a tripod grasp, but pushing them down into the board does not stabilize the wrist. The old fashioned type of Lite Brite actually helped children develop the motor skills to grasp a pencil correctly. I guess that Cube shaped Lite Brite is the next best thing.Barbara Smith OTR/L, author of The Recycling Occupational Therapist."
1,The batteries cost more than the toy,"I believe this is the same lite brite I have. In any case, it required 6 D batteries and to buy that many batteries is about $18, so I am no amused that to play with this you need to spend 2x more. I have never put any batteries in it and it sits in my closet. Not worth it."
3,Not the Lite-Brite from your childhood...,"If you can purchase today's version of Lite-Brite for no more than $10, you won't feel as cheated. It's ""less than"" in every way imaginable. I'm going to purchase some extra pegs & refill papers for one last shot for this toy to remain in our house. We'll see."
2,Be prepared to curse. A lot.,"We received this as a Christmas gift, and I must say my 6 year odl son, who loves everything that lights up and is learning to read, has spent some valuable time with it.THAT SAID. The drawer that is meant to hold the pegs is HORRIBLY designed. The pegs themselves keep it from opening smoothly, and when you do finally pop the thing open, there is no way to keep the pegs from flying everywhere. Trust me. After the third try (some ended up in the disposal- ack) we've decided pegs will be stored separately in Ziploc.It irks me that they didn't test this product well enough to see that it was horribly designed. Or maybe they did, and they just don't care?"
2,watch out!,When you open the tray to pick out the little pebbles the whole tray spills out the little pieces all over the place.
5,Lite Brite,"My grandauther loves her lite brite, it was priced just right and received it in two business days."
2,"My daughter enjoys it, but I have issues with it","We requested the Lite Brite as a birthday gift for my 5 year old daughter not knowing about its redesign. She loves playing with it, so we're happy about that.But I have issues with the redesign.1) The screen doesn't always stay standing when putting in the pegs.2) There is no way to turn off the light. It is on a timer and you have to wait for it to time itself out and turn off. I imagine this means the bulb/battery will burn out sooner than if it was still plug in or had an on/off switch.3) The patterns are not reuseable.4) BUT my BIGGEST ISSUE is with the container that holds the pegs. It sticks so pretty much every time you have to open it, it pops open and all of the pegs fall out. After about 10 times of doing this, I'm ready to throw the whole thing in the trash.Overall I would not recommend this toy."
2,It's okay,"I was so excited when I saw the lite brite in the store and immediately bought it for my 3.5 year old. When I got it home and got the batteries in, I was very disappointed. With the lite brite I had growing up, the peg grid was black, so if you didn't have the picture sheets, you could USE YOUR IMAGINATION and create YOUR OWN designs. However, the new lite brite has a white peg grid which you must use with the several picture sheets and two blank black sheets with white dotes or letters to show you where to poke the holes. The holes on the paper DO NOT line up with the actual holes in the gird. When my daughter uses up all of the picture sheets, I plan on using black construction paper to do the job. I also plan on calling my mother and asking if she still has my lite brite from childhood. The only redeeming factor of this toy is that my daughter loves it, despite all its flaws."
3,Super Vampires,i love the demon story line. i love the lores and the powers that the factions but if you break the system down you have super vampires. replace faith with blood and torment with humanity and lore with disiplines and you have the kindred. this is not a bad thing. in fact i always toyed with the idea of interchanging the powers. overall not the best game WW ever made(exalted) but not the worst(wraith) excellent mixing game though i have failed to see how you can put a demon and a werewolf together. not a must have but a good buy none the less.
1,Botched,"One of the single worst things to be published in recent history by White Wolf. While the changes set down in Dark Ages: Mage completely ignored the time lines in the other mage series, it was atleast contained within the mage line. Demon the fallen on the other hand went further, it ignored the fact that demons have been used in every game, and those demons were not only better than the 'fallen' version, they are completely incompatable. The changes put in this book sent the cosmology of other games into a tailspin, and not for the better. This was a badly done, and worse, unneccesary book."
2,Too much fluff...,I own this book and it was terrible to read. I personally always liked the World of Darkness series but when this game line came out it was like white wolf hinting heavily at ending their Classic WoD series.It seemed to be impossible to read due to the fat that there was fiction everywhere. Sometimes I just want to know what a Lore does without reading a page of fictions. Horribly formatted.
4,short but sweet,"This book is very short, but good for toddlers. They like to ""look through the window""."
4,New thought patterns,"The Impeccable Warrior Of Light is a intersting book about looking at life from a different perspective. The author Peace Mother has within her, a way of explaining why and how we, as human beings do not have to get caught in old programming and negative thinking from society or our parents and choose to be happy, joyful and successful in our lives. Her book is a reminder that you must be open minded to new ways to deal with old problems. .Her book reminded me to not let negatives into my life and that will effect my outcomes in the future.Lee Milteer"
1,where do these new age people come from?,"Okay, if you really have a month or two to waste (it may take you longer on account of the boring contents), you'll see what I mean. When you go into a bookshop and happen to venture into the new age section, this is not what you expect to pick up whilst browsing. In any case, I read thru several chapters (in disgust) and have to say I already feel sorry for the next unsuspecting reader - such a waste of time.This is one best left to gather dust!"
3,Birnbaum's are just ok -,"I buy the Birnbaum's for the pictures - I hate to say that but it is true.As a Disney lover and vacationer, I find the Birnbaum guides are much more promotional, filled with pretty pictures, brochure type of information etc.Would I recommend it? For a first timer, yes. I think trying to soak up the information is part of the planning process. There aren't near as many cruise line books as there needs to be and this one is filled with preview pictures and basic information. However, I also recommend scouring the internet for other resources."
5,"You're paid for the cruise, a few extra bucks for the book won't kill ya!","After all the money you've spent for the cruise, this book will just be a drop in the bucket (or drop in the ocean I should say). I found this book very helpful when I and my family went on the Disney Cruise for my parents' 50th wedding anniversery (grandkids and all). Just finding out where you can get free sodas, water and coffee at all hours, pays for the book by itself. It also explains all the ""ins and outs"" of the different excursions, stuff on board and where to ""hide"" from the kids and have some adult time."
1,buyer beware!,"The Disney cruise line sails to the Pacific during the summer of 2005. Birnbaum purports to talk about the 2005 cruises, yet well over half the book discusses land packages in the Caribbean, and such useless topics as how to get to the Orlando, FL airport. I feel ripped-off, and am sorry I paid good money for this book. If you are cruising Disney this summer, save your money. Don't buy this book."
5,good fun collection,Sometimes these collections are real hit and miss but this particular collection is a very good mix of country old and not so old.
5,Finally an excellent book on Chart patterns,"I'm a software developer writting a program to do chart patterns. I used his first book, but there were conceptual pieces missing. This book fills in the gaps and more. This is an excellent buy and well worth the money! If you are serious about Chart Patterns, then I would suggest this book as a first read and then the encyclopedia of Chart Patterns as a reference. Good humor in the book as well. I like that."
4,"Original, different","There are tons of books in the market on chart patterns but most seem to be copying out from the same sources or from each other. There are only a handful of books that really attempt to see how well these patterns work and under what circumstances. This is one of the better book in this group.This can be heavy reading if you are not a detail oriented person. I do not agree with all his methodologies in coming up with the statistics and scores but that is absolutely better than nothing. The methods are more refined than my own first attempt so I feel I learn something from his approach and it is worth the money (and the weight to carry the book)The person who complained about the trend channels missing should look at his other book - Encyclopedia of chart patterns, which is also a delight.I wouldn't take the statistics blindly though as these numbers can vary greatly under different assumptions and circumstances."
2,Skip this book and go to the originator of chart pattern trading,"The ""analysis"" in the book on success and failure rates is based on 200 stocks. It is not clear over what period of time but a sample size that small to come up the success and failure of patterns? I gave the book 2 stars for being a pattern summary book. The author's site is very good as a reference for checking chart patterns but overall this book provides very little value.Like many authors that speak about chart patterns and trading classical chart patterns very few give credit to the originator of this material.It makes sense because once you read (ISBN 1897597568) Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits by Richard W. Schabacker nothing can even come close to the 1930 book. Schabacker's book is actually a trading course that shows you patterns, setups, and more."
4,From the Stock Traders Headquarters library,This book covers most trading patterns and explains the statistical chances of each pattern being successful. Includes a scoring system for each pattern. Whether you believe in the probabilities in the book as they relate to each pattern is not important. The patterns themselves are the heart of the book in my opinion.David CollettiFounder[...]
1,recomended for begginers at the lowest level.,"Still have to include trendline channel support and ressistance lines that a a breakout will trigger a trend reversal signal And the usual support and resistance lines connecting pivot points that a breakout will trigger a long term trading range signal.So, he ignores this and goes on generating statistics that are worthless.For example consider a head and shoulder failuer after breakout above the neckline. That could be because there is a ressistance line just above the neckline that restrict price advance causing it to decline, that failuer has nothing to do with the Head and shoulder formation. so you get wothless statisticsThere is one free web site that shows all support and ressistance lines and gives buy/sell recomendation. Investtech.com that the author should read. it addition to that they use artificial inteligence to determine the strenght of the formation, Also include volatility, liquidity accumulation/distribution moving average and volume."
2,Historical significance,This was written about a hundred years ago. It is interesting to see what stories were popular for sharing in the libraries of long ago. Don't buy it expecting to get new ideas for library programs.
4,"Great illustrations, easy to read to children","Know and Follow RulesGood book to reinforce your child's understanding of knowing and following rules in every day situations, especially at school. Sweet illustrations too."
3,Better for preschool kids who don't need it,"I got this when my 2 1/2 year old wouldn't stay out of the kitchen drawers or off of furniture that's not meant to be climbed. I was disappointed that this book barely touches on safety (I think it says ""I walk in the hallway"" and ""I use things carefully""; that's it) and doesn't really address the consequences of not following rules. It mostly gives examples of things that are good to do. My favorite part in the kids' text is where it says something like ""I ask permission to use things that don't belong to me."" My favorite part overall was the in notes for adults, where it suggests you can discuss ""respect"" as showing that you think other people are important. I actually foundHave You Filled a Bucket Today?more useful in trying to shape my toddler's behavior."
1,I can't believe you call this repair information.,I bought this CD to help me repair my A/C system on my 83 Volvo. What a joke! I want to return it! There is more information in my $4.00 Haynes repair manual.
2,ALLDATA Personal Edition Automotive Repair Information CD Di,If it contain ledgeable info. about wire diagram for 1983 Volvo 240 DL it will be great.
2,No data and software online,The links to datasets and software don't work. If you read the preface online at Springer you will be misleaded thinking that the author will maintain a site with the data and software used in the book. In fact if you will need to buy finmetrics(Splus module) to reproduce the examples.I don't recommend.
1,"Webpage doesn't work, no datasets","I got this book thinking that since I use S-plus as a derivatives trader at a Bulge Bracket I-bank, how great it is that a Princeton Professor would use this statistical software package to do all sort of analysis of Financial Time Series.Sorry to say that all the datasets that he refers to in the book and that are necessary to do the problem sets are not available. The webpage he constantly refers to in the book just does not work, and none of the other links on his homepage refer you to the datasets.Don't buy this unless you want to waste your money."
1,What a rip-off,"After spending big money for this book, I was shocked I had to shell out even more money to get the data and S-plus scripts. Her book is like an old style teaser. Don't get suckered in."
1,Buyer beware--Chillow Pillow toxic smell,"I bought the Chillow Pillow because I get hot flashes at night and wanted to be able to cool off and sleep better. I am giving this product one star only because it did cool me off. Unfortunately, the pillow also gives off a horrible smell like toxic plastic and it is very strong and it never goes away. I have had my pillow for a month and the smell has intensified over time to the point where I just threw it out this morning. The smell became unberable and I wonder if my health has been in danger inhaling it over the last month. I would not recommend anyone buying this product."
1,chillow pillow doesn't work,"I bought a chillow pillow 4 days ago. My husband said it couldn't work as it would get warm during the night and I said 'no, it has a special gel that remains cool'. Tried it for the first time and it remained cool for about half an hour. During the night it is completely warm (just like any other pillow) and therefore completely useless. I think it is a complete rip off!"
3,Loved it unitl it started leaking after 9 months,I loved this pillow cover until it sprung a leak about 9 months in. No one wants a wet bed or pillow so threw it away. So sad it worked great until it didn't.
5,will be ordering more for everyone else,had nevwethese are realloy cool. was recommended. had never heard about them before now everone wants one.
1,Argonauts of the Western Pacific,The book is a very poor photocopy of the text. The font is extremely small and the overall quality is very poor. I would not recommend this text to anyone. Purchasing a hard copy of it would be a much better way to go.
1,Horrible Service Options when it inevitably stops working.,"I'm a very unhappy customer. The remote stopped working within 6 months (most likely a battery problem). Called DLO and they will not replace just the remote (I would been willing to pay for a replacement part). The only option was to buy an entire new unit. At $129, I just can't justify it, given I have no confidence the new unit will work longer than 5-6 months.I think this remote is pricey for what it does and there's obviously horrible quality assurance and craftsmanship. I also agree with the other negative reviews here that it's not great with a large music collection. This thing is a real overpriced stinker."
1,Not a good system fo the money,"The system was OK when it works. Good idea but it does not understand when different I-pods are placed in the docking station.Also, it never got the playlists correct.Finally after only a few months the remote stopped working and guess what you can't just but a replacement remote."
1,JUNK please don't buy,"Works for about 3 months then develops all kinds of memory problems. can't find songs, displays wrong lists, displays ""out of range"", etc... sometimes just has a black screen and won't work. Exremely frustrating. Customer service recommends resetting with a paper clip in the bottom hole which worked twice. 90 warranty is a joke. save your money."
1,Don't bother,Acutally when it operated it was good but the way you had to plug it in was very cheap and sure to break which it did.I notified the company of it breaking and since it's no longer made I was given a refund...that was awesome!
2,Had one like it. Still didn't do what we need it to do.,"We liked the features this had, like the on screen viewing of the playlist. But it took forever for the music to load. Using it in The Little Gym didn't work. We need the music to load within seconds. We were using the Keyspan which we loved until it would just randomly stop working. It also went through a lot of batteries. We also needed something that was reliable and could reach far away, about 3000 sq ft to be exact. We heard it would random,ly stop working just like the keyspan did and we didn't want to have the same problems it had. Now we use a basic Ipod remote which is still not ideal. It doesn't reach very far and we still have to go all the way over to the IPod itself in order to change the playlist or go to the next song on the playlist. Still looking for the right fix for our problem."
1,DLO Homedock Music Remote,"I would not recommend the purchase of this item. I have a friend who has the same item and his works great. After seeing and using his, I wanted one for my home. I have now purchased four of the units. Three were returned for various reasons (can't believe I continued to purchase another after each broken one). The fourth one I currently have and it worked fine intially. Now it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't work. I would not recommend this item at all. When it works it's great....... just not worth all of the headaches...."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANYOTHER ITEM THAT IS MADE BY DLO FOR IPODS- THEY ARE SHODDY AND DON'T WORK.THE THIRD PARTY SELLER HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO HELP ALSO.
2,Great while it worked but there is another way to use it after it stops working,"This product was great while it worked as long as you didn't have too many play list. However the battery for the remote only last about 6 mos, can not be replaced and the unit no longer works without the remote. However if you take the audio cords used to hook unit to your system off before you trash it the part that fit into the unit also fits into the ipod earphone jack. So you can still hook the ipod up with out the use of the dock its just that you lose the ability to use a remote and the ipod wont charge"
1,Capacity Limit,"In theory this is a fantastic device, and for those with low capacity iPods or small music collections it works as advertised, but if like me you have a 60GB or larger ipod that is almost full you will almost certainly be affected by the device's limit of 50 playlists and 200 artists.As far as i can see this information is not documented on DLO's website (the FAQs state that you can ""Browse and select your entire iPod music library from up to 150 feet away on the compact Music Remote"") or in the user manual and it took an email to DLO's customer service to find this out."
1,HORRIBLE! Save your money!!! TOTAL JUNK!! :-(,"I bought this product due to the remote control with digital display. I thought that would be amazing to have!When I plugged the base into my Bose system all I heard was static. I played with the different input ports with no success.Also, the remote kept saying it was out of range, even after loading the the music onto it, with the remote right next to the dock.I ended up returning this piece of junk and bought a $6.99 cable on eBay that works PERFECTLY! Even though it would be nice to have a digital display, my 12-foot cable is working just fine...and was a heck of a lot cheaper than the HomeDock.I'm really disappointed. I know this isn't the first generation of this product so I'm amazed it's such poor quality.The economy is tough now...save your money and buy a nice long cable. :-)"
1,The non functional DLO,"The remote didn't work from the start. Checked the signal strength per the manual and none detecked. Therefore, the display continuously displayed Out of Range. As you see from the other reviews, any product that has this low a quality control doesn't belong on the shelf."
1,Good while it worked,"DLO Homedock Music RemotePurchased this back in June of 2007. At first it worked great with my IPod Nano. Hoewvwer as time whent on began to lock up and malfunction. When I upgraded to an 80G Ipod Classic it really began to have problems. Finally the remote just stopped working only 9 months after I bought it. No real customer support. It's possible the rechargable battery is dead but is harwired in, so there is no easy way to replace. I have ordered a Philips SJM3151 to replace. The remote uses replacable batteries, will work up to 300 feet with the dock, and is programable for six other units (TV, Receiver, Cable Box, DVD Player, Etc.) Will write a review after I have used it for a few months."
2,Disapointed,"Second review for me. What I thought was a descent product, turns out to be a inferior piece of junk! It works when it wants to...."
2,Cheap construction,"This item does the job it advertises, but the older models were much more durable. The output cable has to be ""just so"" or the feedback is awful. The older model let you control the i-pod from the dock with much more ease. I wish I had spent a few dollars more and purchased something of better quality."
1,Exceedingly poor,"The photography, acting and writing of this film is one of the worst I have ever seen. It is on the level of an amateur home video that some kids made for fun.If you have any kind of taste in cinema do not buy this film!!!!!!!! You will be wasting your money."
1,Awful,"These short stories were horrible, an like an idiot I forgot that I had already seen this so I paid twice ugh!!!!"
2,weird!,"it's okay. i got the first story, but after that it pretty went down hill from there. i like that the girl from PLL is in this movie! she is super purrty. othere than that pretty low quailty and kinda all over the place."
2,"low budget, very high school one act",Most of the short films had no clear begining middle or end. The stories were okay but it was hard to form an opinion on something so short. I really thought since I was paying for this that it would be of a higher quality than the webseries girl/girl scene which is free. Although I do like the last short film in this movie.
3,Very basic crochet,"There are a few simple design ideas but nothing above a beginner level. The designs are charted using a rather strange system but really if it is 10 rows of sc in red, and then ten in yellow you don't need a chart. <G> This might be a book you would want to look at in the library but I don't think you need to buy it."
3,NEW ideas??,"Is a solid-color placemat done all in single crochet really a new idea? How about striped cushion covers done all in the same stitch, or bedspreads made with traditional squares? There are a few creative ideas in this book (such as the teddy bear rug and the Aztec table runner), but most could easily be dreamed up by a person with a modicum of crochet experience and creativity.That said, the how-to information in the first half of the book is very good, although all of the instructions and terminology are British. This would be a good book for a beginner if it had an explanation of the differences in American and British terminology and techniques."
1,i am involved with computer graphic project.,"I think this book is good for create computer graphics,modify image and other entertainment or educational things."
2,"Decent writing, painful pricing","Although providing nice code examples and clearly explaining the mathemantics of standard computer graphics algorithms, its ~270 (paperback) pages do not cover the scope or detail of the ~1100 (hardcover) pages in ""Computer Graphics"" by Foley, van Damm, et al., which costs roughly the same amount. John Wiley & Sons needs to be brought to task on the pricing issue, as the high price really shadows the real value (and business opportinity) of the book. My conspiracy theory is that the publisher is aiming to market it as a text book where students can't counter being ripped off by a publisher endorced by a professor or university."
1,Buyer beware! No annotate feature.,"Be aware that this version is not the Deluxe or Professional version and you will not be able to annotate at all. This means no printable dimensions or text fields to identify rooms and such. OK if you just want to play around, but if you want to design something for real you need to buy at least the Deluxe version. Not much good if you can't print the dimensions of your design.Software crashed on me several times and I was unable to get the tutorial to run until calling tech support. (Tutorial doesn't run well if you use Netscape and you must have Macromedia Flash). I am running XP on a 1.2 GHz box with 768 MB of RAM so that should not be an issue. Tech support from Broderbund is good though."
3,Sorry - not for me...,"I started using this product to try and render a house that was a reasonably simple rectangular design. I found the program great, to a point, and for it's price, it is worthwhile.Unfortunately, I found myself tinkering for ages trying to get walls to meet, making rooms into rooms (by making the walls meet) and found some functions virtually impossible. I tore my hair out for a few hours, then threw it on the WAREZ heap, where it will probably stay.Good for beginners after a cheap solution. Maybe if you're trying to do something tricky, you should invest more dollars, though...."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"This software shows good promise, but the lack of documentation and/or online help makes this product extrememly frustrating and difficult to use. After several hours of trial and error and creating work arounds to very basic editing tasks I was able to create very basic floor plans. This program is supposed to do much more but without any instructions it is just not intuitive enough to get the job done. Even though the program is cheap don't buy it if you put any value on your time."
3,Easy to use and intuitive but too many limitations...,"I was able to learn this software without any instructions very quickly, however there are some severe limitations. If you need to dimension in greater detail than an inch then you run into the problems as the software starts acting weird. Also, if you have a circular room I have been unable to figure out how to design one in this software. Another frustrating thing is wall angles are pre-determined and you cannot specify a specific angle to for a wall to come off another wall. If it was able to do these things it would be an awesome software package."
1,Where's the manual???,"Just wanted something to play with at home. Read great reviews and the price was right. Don't have internet at home which must make a difference. Could figure out a good portion on my own, but thought I'd get SOME instruction with my purchase. All I want is to draw 2-D house plans - nothing fancy. Can't even do that with this software. Can't duplicate plans of existing buildings."
3,Great product for the price,"This is a really fun and addicting software to use. My daughter and I have been ""constructing"" our dream houses on it. There are only two things that are somewhat weak - The ""automatic roof builder"" doesn't have a lot of options, so it's difficult to design the roof in any detail. Also, it's only somewhat user friendly -- although this version, 3, is not the latest version. For the price, it's a great product and a lot of fun. If you are serious about drawing up your home plans in great detail, then I'd definitely upgrade. I'm thinking of buying the 5.0 version to see if they improved the roof option."
1,Not Too Good,"Cant anyone write a book of sample toasts that aren't entirely corny? There were a couple of ""quotes"" that we're ""cute"" but none I would ever say and feel natural about."
5,Great Album,"I think that this album had some very good songs on it. I thought that The Journey also had good songs but in some way their lyrics had become more mature. It showed how they had changed since their first album. Both of the albums are good, and I like Nothing Stops the Rain, All I want is you, How do you want me to love you, Love Sensation, and a lot of other ones. Keep up the great work Jimmy, Lee, and Spike, you guys are the best!"
4,ONE BIG IMPROVEMENT UPON THEIR LAST ALBUM...,"This is the lads' second album and I 'm really impressed by their distinctive improvement upon their last one. The songs are more catchy & it's obvious that Jimmy has got much more confident in his singing in this one! ""All I Want is You"" is the most easy-listening one & it's already a Top Ten Hit in UK. (There are 2 other UK Top 10 singles ""How Do You Want Me to Love You"" & ""Part People...Friday Night"". My fave is ""Nothing Stops the Rain"". It's got a funky beat. Lee's never sounded better! The title track ""Moving On"" is simply brilliant,""...We were dreamers , We were believers..."". And they are a bunch of great singers too! You'll LOVE this album if u like pop music."
5,It has a cute 911 beat and is really a 911 Album !,"As a cool 911 Fan, i can see that this album is one of the coolest avalable in the racks .. so Grab a bag and get it in your shopping carts !"
4,911 is so fine,"911 celebrates another sucessful album after their great debut album ""The Journey"". My fave track is ""Nothing Stops The Rain"" it's got a funky beat. I also love""All I want is You""& ""How Do u want me to love u"" Lee's sound sweeter than ever! it's just If u like pop music buy this album u won't b disappointed."
3,"Some great tracks, but some really suck","The great tracks are HOW DO YOU WANT ME TO LOVE YOU, THE JOURNEY, DON'T MAKE ME WAIT and LOVE SENSATION. Catchy melodies, pulsating rhythms and unforgettable lyrics. Spine-shuddering stuff! Sadly, I can't say the same for the rest of the album. Everything about the remaining tracks sucks! Anyway, on balance it was still worth every cent."
5,It's a Hit!,"My wife was very happy with this pot rack. We ordered the version with the angled hooks so that pots and pans can nest an more will fit on the bar, but it arrived with in-line hooks. Amazon customer service solved the problem by allowing us to order the angled hooks at no cost to us. On the few occasions when I've had an issue with an order from Amazon, their customer service has always met the challenge in exemplary fashion.As for the bar itself, it was of good quality and color and was as we were expecting. The mounting hooks were of good quality. I did not use the plastic drywall straps as I was mounting on a plaster ceiling, so I can't speak to whether or not those would be up to the task of supporting the rack with pots.Well done Enclume and Amazon."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The rope was almost impossible to cut without a tremendous amount of unraveling and then all four strands mooring out boat broke. Subsequently, we have purchased a different brand and it has been much, much better."
4,nice kit,Shipment came fast. I actually traveled with the some of the items from this kit. The moisturizer and the mask.Sometimes my skin would still be dry after after using the moisturizer but overall it was good
4,A helpful primer for the home computer,I found this item easy to use and very informative. I wanted to learn powerpoint but didn't want to attend a formal class. This product filled the ticket.
5,Hilarious,One of the funniest movie I have even seen. Totally side splitting humor in this tale of misadventure.
3,Less than expected,"A fun-through-tears as law-obedient citizens turned into crims-on-run-searched and made it into Mexico to clear their names with testimonies of not-so-law-obedient citizens hiding in Mexico already.Personally, I likeDon't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in The Hoodmuch more."
3,Say what?,"Double Take. Can we say predictable? No. Can we say hard to understand? Yes. For almost the entire movie, I had a hard time grasping what the heck was going on. There were about a billion plot holes that were never filled, and a lot of pointless, unexplained happenings. This was yet another one of those movies that you had to use your psychic abilities to figure out just what was happening.But, on the other hand, Double Take was hilarious. At first, Eddie Griffin was incredibly annoying, but he grows on you and becomes very funny.Also, the ending was superb. It turned out to be a mystery as to who were really the bad and good guys.Double Take is a movie I wouldn't rank as the one of the smartest and well thought out movies ever, but if you want to laugh a lot, then rent it. Take a chance on this one. 3 Stars"
4,doublesuprise,"seemed to be a movie to check out. was sooo much better than anticipated. hilarious performances and fast moving plot, made this a BUY ME! for my family"
3,decent yet spinny,"Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't bad it just isn't that good either. It keeps you guessing but in the end when you find out who's side who is on, it doesn't make sense. If you think back to different scenes in the movie, I know they want to keep you guessing, but some of the incounters don't seem to fit when you see who is playing on what team in the end. Funny and pretty entertaining but too messed up to keep you from leaving the fantasy world of entertainment."
3,Comedic freshness...worth a look.,"This film actually impressed me with its story. From reading the customer reviews I can understand how some viewers could be eluded by the plot. Typical viewers of this type film don't expect to be challenged by sophisticated plot twists and multiple ""double takes"". I was also impressed by the actors. Orlando Jones and Eddie Griffen are funny and work well together. Not to mention that they are fresh faced and relatively new to the silver screen.The DVD offers extra features including a Director's Diary. Director George Gallo gives a day by day review of the production of this film which began shooting in April 2000. Complete with behind the scenes video footage."
5,excellent book,I will keep this one in my library. Very informative and interesting. Great ideas for starting a new program.
5,Excellent series,"I'm a big fan of Stackpole's writing. The first book in The Age of Discovery struck me as a bit different than some of this other work. And I'll honestly say that it took a little more time than usual for me to get into Book 1. But the book builds and the series as a whole is an excellent read. I can't recommend the book, the series, and this author highly enough."
1,This machine sucks,We had an older model of this machine at our office and it lasted for a couple of years. Last month we replaced it with this one and it's already going out. Dont waste your money.
1,broke at 2 months,"I just bought the ACOMDATA 160 gig external hardrive for my G4- as an addition to my ACOM 80 gig external. The 160 gig is clicking now, without booting, and I am very worried about my audio data. This hardrive is used for professional purposes. The 80 gig is continuing to work fine, but to have the 160 go bad in two months is not good. I have read on line that ACOM has good customer service. I hope this is true. I'll be calling them Monday to see what can be done. If they can fix this new hardrive, and save my data as well, I will write back here."
1,failed after 24 months,"Bought the 160 and now I get the ""click of death"" (remember that, Zip drive fans?). Maybe 24 months sounds like a long time, but I've got stuff that last much longer. This was actually my backup drive, so I still have most of my primary data intact. Now I have to find another drive. Hmm, but not an Acom."
5,Fascinating,"The problem with this book is not its academic accuracy. Its problem is that its worst critics are completely influenced by their religious faith. Even if the story presented by Dr Thiering were false, it is millions of times more credible than the myth of the ""god incarnated, born of a virgin, who walked on water, turned water into wine, resurrected the dead and who himself resurrected after dying on the cross"". It is curious that scholars, proud of their ""Western"" scientific methodoly, quickly dismiss this book as a ""false theory"" and at the same time give credence to completely impossible facts, like the miracles and supernatural events associated to the life of Jesus of Nazareth. They surely are buying their little piece of heaven. It's the big contradiction of the Western world."
2,Wish I had looked more closely...,"This book, Jesus & the Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls, is the exact same book as Jesus the Man, both by Barbara Thiering. One is published in Sydney and London under the title, Jesus the Man, and the other is published in the U.S. by HarperCollins. This may help other readers avoid buying both books, as I did, thinking that they are 2 different books."
2,too much conjecture,"I bought this book after seeing the TV documentary, which I thought was very interesting. However, by the time I got about half-way through the book, I realized that her conclusions are based upon wild conjecture. Thiering believes that basically everything in the gospels is symbolic and that she has discovered the keys to understanding the real story behind the fiction. The real story, of course, was hidden from the uninitated, and now that hidden knowledge that was lost for thousands of years can be yours! Ya, right. If you like conspiracy theories, this book will probably interest you. If you want a good book about the Dead Sea Scrolls, look elsewhere."
3,Beware of Stuck Pixels,"The Toshiba 23HL85 looks great in my living room. But although the picture quality is generally very good, it is aggrevating when my attention is occasionally drawn to the pixels that have been stuck since I took it out of the box. LCD TV manufacturers and sellers want you to accept this as par for the course. My advice- do more research than I did and test your TV in a store before you buy it."
4,nice pedal,I thought it was for the set that is what i had been looking at watch it they are tricky. But pedal is high quality.I will be sending it back.
5,A highly commended story of identity and self-discovery,"Sun Yung Shin's Cooper's Lesson is a bilingual picture book, written in both English and Korean, telling the story of a young boy who is frustrated over being ""half and half."" Yet speaking with Mr. Lee, the owner of the neighborhood grocery store, he comes to learn that the nature of a person is not a simply defined, either-or prospect. Kim Cogan's full-color illustrations provide a strong overtone of realism to deftly complement this sometimes complex and highly commended story of identity and self-discovery."
3,OK book,"Not very enlightening for me, but I pick it up every once in a while, and then put it down again for a long while. ""The Artist Way"" is very similar, and preferred by me."

1,Irish Gala not so gala,"Sorry to report my disappointment with this video. Despite the considerable talent assembled, the show is an unholy mess. It seems to have been thrown together with little rehearsal resulting in some of the worst singing i have ever heard. Everyone is flat, and the songs sound dreadful. Carlos Nunez gives a lovely instrumental performance but even he ends on a flat note. The ""Riverdance"" segment doesn't help, I couldn't help compare it unfavorably to the orginal company."
3,Sweet design!,"The design is nice and the quality of the shirt is good the only thing is that the sleeve cuffs are very tight especially for the extra large that I ordered. My boyfriend doesn't like wearing because of this. He is a true XL and I am a M but this shirt cuff fits my wrists snuggly, so beware of this issue."
4,Don't mess with a compressor,This thing works GREAT! The price was better then I could find on the Dewalt. Then go read the specs. Its a better unit then the Dewalt. Look at the weight difference.
4,Dobbs Road Project,"Needed to construct a structural plate arch pipe (13'X22'X36') using 2000+ 3/4"" bolts. Used two of these impact wrenchs continuously for 4 days. Worked well, although the driving end became extremely hot during continuous operation. One developed a slight leak of lubricant on the shaft output end. Although ""light weight"", working overhead was quite tiresome. Allowed project to be completed on schedule and with both wrenches still operational."
2,A Disappointment,This attempt to extend a masterpiece of poetic philosophizing on matters a woman ponders at mid-life is a whiney and disappointing series of personal complaints in the self-congratulatory self-pity mode followed by trite self-help suggestions at the end of each chapter.
2,it's okay,"I got this book for Christmas and Linda Howard's story made me laugh, it was so bad. It could have been made into a great novel, but it was extremely unbelivable, the characters were two-dimensional, and her story was pretty bad. The other stories are pretty good. I don't think I've read the other authors, so I don't have anything to compare them to, but Howard's story disappointed me.She is usually a thought-provoking author, and in my opinion one of, if not the, best authors I've ever read. Also, the switching between historical and contemporary when I was expecting all contemporary was frustrating. All in all, it was an ok book at best."
4,OK,"The love story in ""The Triumph and the Glory"" was a much deeper journey into romance than anything in ""Under The Boardwalk"", but this is still a very satisfying book. By all means, get a copy and take it to the beach or the lake, you'll enjoy yourself."
2,High cut shoes,"This appears to be a good shoe but it ""hits"" my ankle. For me I can not wear the product even after installing insoles."
4,Buy This CD,"This CD has some unbelievable beats on it. If you're into the jam band scene then this is definitely for you. Particle, Addison Groove Project, Beanstalk, all bands you need to hear on this album. It's real funky and will make you move."
5,Everyone should have a copy,"What a shame that this little volume of wisdom and insight by Paul Gallico is out of print. I originally received this from a friend as a college student many years ago. I recently bought it as a gift for my niece, a college student. A beautiful allegory about the meaning of life that everyone should experience."
2,Christianity in a Can,"This book is not a metaphor for life. It is a metaphor for a Christian view of life. It is not a book which most ex- or non-Christians would especially want their children to read. It presumes the existence of a Male God and the human Soul. It also implies that war is simply the necessary fight of good people against an obviously-evil enemy (fire). Ironically, this book seems to deny hope for the ""family value"" that children can maintain relationship with their parents for life."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this game for my 6 year old daughter. We installed it and it was a complete mess! I had to uninstall it and reinstall it 3 times just to access this parental control area. I would open it but could not enter anything. Then we could not sign in on the sign in page. Finally we got everything to work and went online to access the online features of the game and as soon as we started the game, it said there was a new update from disney and to wait until the game updated. As soon as it did, it shut down. After that, when we tried to start it again and it said the wrong disk was in the drive and we couldn't play it after that. Called the CS number on the games manual and got my money back!!"
1,Internet functionality is no longer supported,Disney Interactive will no longer be supporting the Internet aspects of Disney Girlfriends. The Online Host Server for the program will be off-line as of February of 2004. While you can still play the game without the internet functions it just isn't the same. My daughter use to love to play this game but now we will probably use it as a coaster.
3,Game had potential,"This game would have been more enjoyable if the internet features would have worked. I installed the game for my daughter and did not have any problems installing it, but when she tried to access the internet features, we found that they did not work at all. I rated it a 3 star because my daughter did enjoy the other features."
1,Not worth it,"My daughter received this software as a gift. Much to her dismay, the program never worked. I experienced so many problems installing the program and never got it to work online with the internet features or offline either. The Disney Girlfriend server did go offline in Feb 2004. I am in the process of requesting my money back."
3,"A bit rough, but a great start.","This is the book that hooked me on Tabitha King. I found that I much preferred her writing to that of her husband and set out to find all that she had published. Though this is not my favorite book by Ms. King, it is nonetheless a worthy read. It will make you look around corners and think twice while hiking alone. For a complete change of direction, make your next read ""Pearl"" by this promising author."
3,an okay read,An okay read that took awhile to get interesting. After Liv left her husband with her son to their summer home is only when the story got interesting (and after about 100 pages). Some interesting thriller but predictable outcomes.
2,What's it about??,"Something about a toothache, marriage difficulties, a Vietnam screenplay, a lesbian neighbor...and apparently, if you read far enough, a woman being trapped in a cabin by three sadistic thugs. Hmmm...I should marry somebody famous so I can publish any zeitgeisty, unstructured, leaden-prosed, mundane typing exercise too. BORRRRRING!!! (and I am not easily bored)."
1,Not as good as her husband,"The only reason I got this book is because she is Stephen King's wife. If she didn't have his name or backing, then I don't think she would ever be published (based only on this one book of hers, as I have not ready anything else she has written)A woman who is in a cold, loveless marriage takes off to a summer cabin with her young son, and then every womans worst nightmare happens..She and her son are trapped in hell with rapists and murderers. The rape scenes are vulgure, disburing, and not at all needed.Boreing beginning, Predictable ending and violent to the core. One star."
3,medium,"great decanter, but the warehouse it came from didn't ship it until the day it was to arrive. no apologies or reasons or anything from the warehouse manager. they shipped it and it arrived 5 days late. not the worst thing to happen, but it blew my christmas."
2,Disappointing,"Interesting concepts discussed, but too much focus on the presenter- shots of him doing yoga, on the beach, playing with his son. It felt like an homage to the Philip Gardiner at several points.The issues that are brought up are not in an organized fashion with end to war, caring for children, dolphins and whales all thrown in together. My advice- watch it before you buy it. I didn't."
1,Totally worthless product,"Oh great - now they're giving you TWO cans of worthless scented spray. Cutter has a lot of nerve putting junk like this on the market. If anything, it excites the mosquitos and appears to feed them into a biting frenzy. I'm sure they're trying to be ""green"" or the gov't cut them a deal or something. Maybe Cutter feels guilty for killing all the world's mosquitos, so instead filled the can with Prozac so nobody would care. But I can spray this stuff into a swarm and the swarm will get bigger! It actually attracts them, and after emptying the can, one hour later they swarm was huge with NO sign of dead mosquitos anywhere.Use YardGuard or Coleman's campsite fogger - this stuff is a joke. I noticed they also got it past Home Depot's and Lowes buyers too - their salesmen must be able to sell snowballs to eskimos"
3,good,"Good overall, love the book and the kids love listening to the bible read in rhymes. However the cover was a little wrinkled."
5,Best book for young children,"My oldest son loved this book. Reading it to him as a baby always calmed him and he payed close attention. Later he loved me reading it to him everynight. We got so we almost had it memorized. My youngest son was slower learning to like books (he has Down Syndrome). This was one of the first books that he would listen to and not immediately want to close the book. This book has wonderful rhyme and rhythm while staying much truer to the bible than most children's bible books. The only problem is it's rhyme is so rememberable that it messes me up a little on the true wording of bible verses. I always like David saying ""You come to me with a spear and a sword, but I come to you in the name of the Lord!"". Take that Satan."
5,Joy to Read,I absolutely love this Book. I received as a gift for my two month old and have been taking it to other baby showers ever since. The stories are sweet and rhyme which keeps older kids' attention. Plus it is Biblically accurate. I am so glad my child is starting to hear Scripture at such an early age. I also enjoy hearing these stories over and over.
5,Love it!,"I've been reading this to my 3 year old since he was 1, and he still loves this book. We're big believers in reading them scripture, but the rhyming in this book makes it very easy to keep them interested. Now that he's older and knows the stories, he likes listening to it from the Bible alongside these stories (he still likes to ""see Jesus"" with the pictures). Definitely recommend this one :)"
5,Perfect Bible for toddler,"we got this Bible for our 20 month old granddaughter. one page has a couple of lines of ""rhyme"" and the other page has a wonderful picture to go with the verse. each page is between 4-8 lines, so nothing to long for a little one to sit thru. i read thru the whole thing before giving it to our little one. this will be perfect for my son and his wife to read to her each day to help her start learning about Christ. i am very pleased with this Bible and have already told other grandparents about it."
4,Good rhyme Bible for kids!,"I bought this book for my son. He is only 3 months old but I love to read to him and I wanted to get a book with Bible stories that were easy to understand for when he gets older! I can't really speak for him as to whether he likes it yet as he's so young. He always sits there quietly while I hold it out and read it to him. I like it alot! The rhymes are cute and easy. It begins with the story of creation, Adam and Eve and goes all through the Bible's most popular passages up until the resurrection of Jesus! It really covers alot and I like that!"
5,good rhyming and condensing of the Bible,"Delightful. More expensive than the rhyme bible for toddlers, but is also twice as thick. The two books are drawn by the same artist. I recommend buying this one instead of the toddler version because it is big and thick and thorough enough to worth the extra money."
2,wobble deck,"I expected this to be better for working on the child's balance, but it in fact is easy to balance except for trying to hit the different colors."
2,Not that easy for kids or adults,"We bought this for our 4 year old after reading the reviews. This is NOT appropriate, he is not heavy enough to actually trigger the buttons--we can barely do them ourselves--if you do not hit the EXACT spot on the colored pegs, it will immediately go onto the next game. It is not that he is uncoordinated (as he rode a bike without training wheels when he was 2 and could ice skate at the age of 3, we think quite the opposite). In any case, we opted for this because the alex toys balance board is way too easy for him. This balance board is just not that fun for anyone--and as I said, not easy for a child who is not heavy enough to trigger the system to make the game work. The sounds are also fairly annoying. If you are looking for a more challenging balance board for your child who is athletic and ready for a challenge, I'd recommend getting just a standard balance board."
2,Wobble Deck too wobbly for a four year old!,I bought this toy for my 4 year old grandson but he was unable to do it. He could not keep his balance and the voice commands were too hard for him to follow. It may be alright for a 6 to 7 year old.
3,Quality Product,"This is a well made toy, but my 4 and 6 yr old boys just don't seem all that interested in playing with it much."
1,My child did not like this at all.,"Not age appropriate, we were very disappointed with this toy. When I saw this toy I was very excited to get it and watch the kids play with it. They did not like it just about as soon as they stepped on it. Was not any fun at all. I big waste of money."
4,Looks like fun,"Our grandson will receive this for Christmas. I can't give a true review but if I was four years old, I'd love it."
2,needs some design changes,"This thing only works when used on a hard surface, and you have to hit the sensors against the ground pretty hard to register the input. Harder than my child could make the sensors hit the ground reliably in fact. In order to make it any fun for her, I had to glue plastic bumpers to the sensors on the bottom so that the sensor gets pushed further into the board with less force required, meaning that even a gentle tap on the sensor registers the hit, and I had to put it on a hard board on the carpet. Using it on our hardwoods actually DAMAGED the floors. So what you've got here is a toy that's supposed to teach kids to balance, but requires that they SLAM the sensors down, and requires that they learn on a hard surface like concrete, unless you do what I've done to it. It's a good idea for a toy, but a poor implimentation."
2,Boring,"My 5 yr old son hates this toy, it was entertaining for about 5 minutes then never played with again unless I pulled out to try to entice him again. It's been a year of non-interest, so moving on to a new home."
4,coordinated fun,"i bought this for my 4 year old, and it is difficult for her, but she uses it everyday, so i'm sure she will learn. my 10 yr old loves it, and she does well on it. manufacture's age recommendation is a good guide line!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped,I was really excited by this toy but the kids were not as thrilled. It takes a good attention span and desire to play this game and enjoy it. It may have been better received if it hadn't been Christmas and they didn't have so many other toys to choose from. I think it's a toy they can grow into and will enjoy eventually. All I know is I had fun with it and I'm a tad bit over the 100 pound weight limit!
2,Not a balance toy,This is not a balance toy at all and it is difficult for my 5 year old to accurately strike the right color because you have to hit it hard. I would not recommend this toy if you are looking for something to improve balance.
4,Wobble Deck,Our 7 year old daughter got this from Santa and loves it. It is just what she needed to help improve her balance. And her 5 and 6 year old siblings enjoy it too. It's nice that it incorporates mind games with physical ability. Can't rate the durability accurately as we have only had it a week. Great so far!
1,Not great,"My 5 yr old daughter received this as a gift. After reading reviews on it, I thought it would be great fun. Well, it's aweful. She's frustrated with it and the voice is not loud. Even when she does what it asks, it doesn't recognize it. What a waste, unfortunately."
1,Not registering colors,"Returning it. My husband who is pretty athletic could not get it to register all the colors. He tried for 30 minutes on a hard wood floor. Both kids tried it. Yes they can get it to occasionally register a color, but more often than not the annoying voice says ""oops"". It is impossible to play ""simon"" when even though you are clearly balanced on the right color, the board doesn't register it. DON'T WASTE THE MONEY.Just to be clear, I tried sitting on the ground and tried to push the right side/color down and it would only register about 60% of the time. The sensors are not working."
2,Disappointing,"My son received this toy as a generous gift, unfortunately, it has been sadly disappointing. As stated by some reviewers - the board does not seem to register the hits unless extreme force is used. My 6 yr. old son got frustrated quickly and resorted to using his hands to bang the colors/numbers - thus defeating the whole point of the balance or ""Wobble"" game. Even when my husband and I tried it-- more often than not it did not register the hits. I don't know if our wood floors are not level enough or if the toy is defective-- but currently it is just taking up space in our apartment."
4,Fun for varied ages and abilities,"I have an athletic 9 year old and a clumsy 7 year old - both love this toy. It wasn't on any Christmas list but, when I saw it, I thought it could be fun on snowy or really cold days when outside might not be great. They were a little hesitant when they unwrapped it not knowing what it was but, once opened and batteries inserted, they loved it. They play all different levels and turn off the tv to do it. They compete and they help each other. They love the accent of the speaker (British?). Anyway, so fun and a great buy. Highly recommeneded!"
2,Disappointed,"This toy is a disappointment. The bottom of it is made of hard plastic, not a round rubber surface as I imagined. It does not ""wobble"" smoothly because of that. As the other reviews said, it is difficult to get the sensors to register. Perhaps if is was slightly higher and more round, there would be more leverage for this to happen. I am disappointed in this toy and the physical fitness benefits I was hoping it would bring with it."
4,Walt Yensid,"I thought they were very tasty, so did my grandchildren. They were gone in a few days. Only problem I have with this product it is not made in the US any more, but is made in Mexico now. I will look for an American product."
1,I have the US Post Office CHecking into this matter.,"Because they left the package outside the wrong door, we dont know where the package is. any student could have picked up."
5,Works great,"These are great for the price, its allot better then spending the 60 dollars or more for the same thing. My wife and i both have one and we love them."
4,Good buy,"I love the brush, and can see a big difference in my dental hygiene. The price was reasonable, and the replacement brushes are also well priced."
4,I Love These,"These things work great without breaking the bank. No point in buying the ones in the store that look like something your dentist would have in their basement. What's even better is the replaceable brushheads as to where u can save even more $! About the only negative here is the batteries sometimes get corroded, which can be messy & hard to remove."
2,Poor design......,"After my Oral-B battery brush finally died, I decided to try the Crest brand battery brush. Big mistake! First of all, it took 3 different people to finally get the battery cover off to replace the two batteries. I used cooking oil on the plastic parts so it would come off easier the next time the batteries needed replacement. That did help, although I was surprised how quickly this would be necessary.The brush does spin quite fast and with a fair amount of power.Compared to the Oral-B, this is a poor design....plus it uses 2 batteries instead of one.Get the Oral-B. A much better buy, only one battery needed and better quality."
2,Broke almost immediately,"The design must be defective, because I'm reading review after review where people have a similar experience. My spinbrush failed after just a few days. It seems that water somehow got into the battery compartment and quickly corroded the electronics. I've owned previous models of spinbrush and they held up pretty well. It seems that this new 2-speed variety of brush has a design defect. Definitely not recommended."
5,works well,"my daughter recieved a crest spinbrush for christmas and she claimed that it was the best brush ever 5 months later, comparing her experience to going to the dentist for a cleaning.so i got one. and i too am impressed. neither of us are experiencing the problems i read here. both brushes remain in operable condition and show no sign of wear.and the amazon price is so good that the price of one spinbrush is comparable to two regular brushes from the market. today i am buying replacement heads for both my daughter and myself. when the brush(es) tanks, i will be back to buy more.**update**three months later and all is still well. both brushes work superbly and do not seem to have the problems others mention with leaks and so forth. working as designed. -bw 7.28.08"
2,spinning is off,"I bought this toothbrush because I was looking for one that was not a kids toy. I have no basis for how it should work because I have never had anything quite like this. Basing my selection on past purchases, I expected to have a similar experience with this brush. I like the design and the coverage area of the brushes (the last one that I got seemed to have been made of rubber. But, once you manage to turn it on it acts like a jackhammer (bone jarring) in your mouth. I looked for some way to see if I could turn it down but no go. I am now afraid to use it because I am afraid that I will lose tooth enamel because it seems much too strong for its purpose. They can rightly boast that it gives you a clean cleansing but I feel that with continued use one might also wind up with a cleam mouth."
2,Pinch and Die,"I guess you really get what you pay for with this ""powered"" tooth brush. It stays powered for about 2 brushing sessions, and then for the next 10 you think this is the last time - it is going to die mid brush. When it dies mid brush and you have half of your mouth all nice and brushed and a mouth full of paste. Then you are forced to use something else to finish the job. I bought 2 replacement heads at the same time. The next day I had to buy a 20 count battery pack. Cheaper than buying a new ""powered"" brush. I just hope they last me through the 2 additional heads. All that said... that isn't the worst of it. It pinches my tongue and cheek, I thought I just needed to learn how to avoid that, but now 3 months into it, this morning I had 5 pinches."
1,Defective Design,"If you get it wet it stops working, which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush. If you want something to work for a month or two its fine, otherwise avoid it entirely. I intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture, pretty quickly after ordinary use."
1,Battery compartment is the weak point,"I've bought two of these tooth brushes and both have had the same problem: the battery compartment. The black o-ring within the battery compartment is the cause of the trouble. It either prevents the proper closure of the battery compartment, as other reviews have noted, or it eventually breaks entirely, allowing even more moisture inside. I've tried to find that particular o-ring in hardware stores, the Crest website, and elsewhere, but have not succeeded. If Crest would make them available, these units might last a lot longer. When they work properly, I really like these brushes, which is why I bought a second. However, until the company either supplies the o-ring replacements or, better yet, develops a new design for the battery compartment, I would strongly discourage people from buying this product."
1,Spinbrush Electric toothbrush,"This product failed after 5 weeks due to a frozen activation switch. The battery compartment is very difficult to open. A very poorly design that should be withdrawn from the market. I now have the Oral B electric toothbrush and found it to be very welled designed, water proof, battery is easy to replaced. Stay away from the spinbrush and buy the Oral B product instead."
1,ACOM DATA DRIVES SUCK,I bought a 60 GB ACOM DATA 2.0 drive. 8 Months Later CRASH AND BURN. $160.....I LOST EVERYTHING......All financials for business and a design portfolio spanning four years. ACOM refuses to help me. HORRIBLE!.....DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ACOM DATA
1,Mine lasted 1.5 years. Guess I should be happy.,"Before today I would have thought these neg. reviews were just bad luck or user neglect. Put me on the list too. The product was a dud. After a year and a half or very light use.(20GB of itunes music) The hard drive was still working, the fw/usb board was ""bad"" according to acomdata tech support.I guess I should feel lucky that mine lasted as long as it did, and it wasn't the hard drive, but I don't. Just a waste of time and money.No more Acomdata for me.Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."
1,Crashed Hard Drive in 4 months: lost family pics,"they should not be in business. i lost hundreds of pics of my children. after 4 months, the system crashed. i sent it to tech support, my rep was chris short. he proposed to get the info off the hard drive for $700.. it's a con. amazing reputable stores sell this junk."
2,"After 4 months it crashed, took 2 weeks to get Tech Support","I purchased the 120GB USB Firewire at the end of Oct '03 for storing video clips. I had a problem at first getting my iMac to recognize the drive but other than that it was fine until 2 weeks ago when I turned it on and it made a terrible clicking sound. I tried disk warrior to no avail. In the meantime, I tried calling and emailing Acomdata tech support and no one would respond. Finally, 10 days later reached a human being at the firm and refused to get off the phone until I spoke to a a live person in tech support. They said to me that the data is probably lost but offered to look at the HD. Although I can ultimately restore my data from tapes, I still lost hours of work, never mind the frustration of trying to reach this company. I don't trust them and suspect that the reason I couldn't get a response out of them is because they are responding to other irate customers!"
1,I agree with everyone else...,"this drive is a piece of junk. I can't remember when I bought it, but the manufacture date says March 2004 and the thing quit on me. It worked fine, then I had it unplugged for about 2 months and when I went to use it again it made the awful clicking sound others have described. Before badmouthing ACOM, I want everyone to know that I cracked the sucker open and the hard drive inside was a Western Digital. Acom isn't evil, they just use really poorly made drives! I lost all of my music -- over 70 gig!!! I am so bummed right now!!!!!"
1,ClosetMaid Hanging Bar,"This has to be a wrong price - $70 plus dollars for a clothes bar? Please look at this!!ClosetMaid 4-Foot Hanging Bar for SuperSlide Shelves, White #2057"
1,Not a durable product,"I love the features and clarity of this phone. That said, the positives end there. The caller ID is screwy in that if someone calls, but hangs up on the answering machine it won't record the number in the caller ID log. Also, it frequently 'loses' the handset so you must reregister the phone. I've had the phone 4 years now and its just toast. It just flashes and Siemens doesn't directly support this model anymore. I'm going back to Panasonic."
2,Lacks Simplicity,"This phone is the most complicated phone I have ever seen. The menu is incomprehensible, with options which are abrieviated so much that you can't tell what you're choosing. The Siemens 4210, on the other hand, is much simpler to use and doesn't have an obnoxious ringer like this phone."
4,Cute little phone - just what I was looking for!,"Ok, I'm not too picky about my phones. All I was looking for was a small cordless with call waiting caller id. I wasn't interested in any other features (like answering machine). This phone is in my basement that we just finished. I thought the size was perfect, and it has a nice belt clip for going outside with it, or just walking around. The clarity is good, and I really haven't found anything to complain about. I like the fact that we can expand with additional handsets when we want, which we'll probably do eventually. Also, I'm not one to read directions - and I noticed this red light blinking on top of the phone. It does this for calls that have come in that were registered in it's caller id, and were not answered on that phone. That is a feature I don't need. We have several phones, and don't always answer from the same one. But, I can certainly live with it. All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase."
1,Not worth the money,"The phone itself is complicated to use and set-up, has the most annoying ring I have ever heard and is cheaply made.I would suggest buying a Sony or Panasonic instead. I sent mine back."
1,Worst phone I have ever owned,"This phone is so poorly designed that I have nothing positive to say about it except that it is small. It rings very annoyingly and chirps loudly for no reason when you do something like simply hanging it up - try hanging up the phone while someone is sleeping in the next room, and you'll have problems. It has an incomprehensible menu, and the handset goes dead when it runs out of battery charge without any warning. That's the only time it DOESN'T make any noise. It runs out of batteries very quickly, so this happens often. You won't see all of these irritating features until you actually get your hands on this phone after purchase, so don't waste your time or money."
1,The worst phone ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really hate this phone. I've bought the basic $19.99 GE special (in black or white)in the past and those phones, sad to say, are much better than this one. This phone is nearly impossible to program. It is awkwardly shaped and slippery so I am constantly dropping it. You have to monitor the battery constantly because the thing always dies in mid-conversation. It also cuts out -- just goes dead sometimes - for no apparent reason. It also makes an awful chirping sound when returned to the cradle or when it rings. The keys are SO sensitive that it is nearly impossible to even enter numbers or letters. Alas, it seems like my spotted history with this device might be over. It died on me today after a year of ownership. I replaced the batteries. The thing is still dead."
2,Boo Siemens!,"I gave this two stars, only because it has some neat bells and whistles but I had to return it. I bought it for the speaker phone feature and could only get a faint sound when I tried to use it. When I called Siemens customer service, the guy told me, ""Sounds like it's broken. Guess you'll have to return it."" Thankfully, Amazon is wonderful about returns so I will buy a different phone from them. You can be sure it will NOT be a Siemens!"
3,good not great,I was really hoping for a breakdown video of how the songs are played. Jorma does go into the how's and whys but not deep enough into the how to. I would like to have complete detailed analysis of the songs instead of abreviated versions.
4,"Great guitarist, shabby production",But if all you want is to learn how he does it...he shows you and does a good job too!
4,Dark and wonderful,"I love Luis Royo's work, and this is yet another masterpiece by him. I won't give an art review here. I'll just say that the presentation and print quality of the book are outstanding."
3,What's going on with royo?!?,"Everyone's favorite fantasy artist seems to have been going through some things lately. His last three books, of the Prohibited trilogy, have been skirting from fantasy to smut.We all know Royo is an excellent artist in his genre ( or even out of his genre), but the last three, and especially Prohibited 3, are pretty..uh..graphic. His ability is undeniable, but his subject matter in the Prohibited series makes me a tad uncomfortable. (...)"
3,Adults only,"A risque, coffee-table book this one is not. The pictures have a heavy adult sex act themes. Unlike most of his art books, this one is mainly small sketch style drawings done in black and white. The cover is no indication of the contents."
4,ONE OF THE SERIES FOUNDERS,"This is the second in the series, and whilst it is a great book, it lacks the detail of many of the other in this series. It only covers the WWII era of this vessel that served up to Vietnam. Very hard to find but still perfect for any enthusiast or modeller."
2,Very unhappy,"The book was not what I expected, the pages were cut short and a lot of material was not there because of the pages being cut wrong, also the print was far to small for reading, I'm very dissapointed with this purchase and would not recommend it to any one. And what's really a kicker is that I served on that ship for almost 2 1/2 years. To sum it up very unhappy would be the word I'd use.Respectfully, R.Alden"
3,Only received 1/2 of my order.,"Crest Pro Whitening SpinBrush Toothbrush Refill, Medium (2 Refill Heads)No problem with the item but the ad said 2 packs of 2 brush heads, that's what I purchased but only received 1 pack of 2 brush heads. Only got half the order. Contacted seller, wanted the missing pack but received a 60% refund instead. All is ok I guess, but I don't appreciate them not even having an explanation for the mistake, nor the fact that they would rather give the refund instead of paying the shipping cost to send me another pack. They didn't even tell me if they had another pack to send. I feel like they just didn't want to be bothered. That's ok, because I won't bother them again either. Sold by: kaiserfpsuperintern"
3,Not bad at all!,"I first heard the song ""Radium"" on a radio site and I had to know who these guys were. ""Radium"" is absolutely amazing in every way--the singer really steals the show and the guitar rounds up the energy and blows you away. If you only get one song, get that one!The rest of the songs are decent but don't really live up to that one, the singer seems to vary in his performances and seems like he's tryin' too hard to imitate contemporaries. Nevertheless these songs have a certain appeal to them--the basslines, drums and guitar hooks are fresh produce. I think it's a good effort from them, the better of the two albums I've heard so far. Apparently they changed their name to Echocast a few years ago, so I'll have to look into that...Top cuts: ""Angel"", ""Surround"", ""Radium"", ""Supernova"", ""Artificial Love Song"", ""Anesthetic"""
5,Fascinating portrayal of a great servant of God,"I read this book as a college student and loved it! It tells the story of the great missionary to China, Lottie Moon, in a way both realistic and inspirational. Lottie Moon has been referred to as ""the closest thing Southern Baptists have to a saint"", and anyone who reads this biography will understand why. You will see Lottie's life from her childhood, through her college conversion and call to be a pioneer missionary to China, until her death as a martyr of charity who gave all that she had to relieve the starving Chinese during a famine, thus starving herself. The reader will see Miss Moon, not as some caricatured Hollywood notion of a strait-laced insensitive missionary, but as a brilliant intellectual, promoter of women's welfare - she fought against the practice of foot-binding in China - and proclaimer of God's mercy in Christ."
3,This Is Not a Linguistics Textbook,"While I agree with some of Dr. Trask's criticisms of this work, I think he is looking at this as a professor of linguistics might. I, too, was disappointed by some aspects of this book, but I must take issue with Dr. Trask describing such developments as semiotics as irrelevant to linguistics. If one wants an ""initiation"" into linguistics's place alongside of theory and literature, this work has at least some things to offer, especially Kristeva's exploration of language's status as an unknown since before the Socratics.The work didn't go deeply enough and holds nothing near the fascination of her other superb works, such as ""Revolution."" To give it minus twelve stars is certainly an over-reaction, though.Literature Ph.D. Student"
4,Works weel enough,"I put these in my truck box, just for some light if I need to get into it at night. Don't fool yourself and think that these will have the light output of a couple of headlights. They aren't that bright, but they give plenty of light for rummaging around in the bed of a truck. I installed 2 of them, and have the 3rd for something else, just not sure what yet."
2,"Light sensing, not so much...","I bought these to go inside a closet, thinking that when the door is open, they will come on. Not so much. Mounted in a useful position, openeing the closet did not provide enough light (even on the low-light setting) to turn these on. So I moved it right up to the front of the closet. Well, that worked... however when you close the closet, the light reflecting off the door is enough to keep the stupid thing on, so it wouldn't turn off. I wound up turning off the light sensor and just using it as a tap light. Maybe my closet and lighting is unique, but I doubt it."
3,Need light to turn on the auto light,"So, this wasn't clear to me before I bought this, but you need light to turn on the light automatically. That's kind of stupid. If I already had a light, why would I need to buy this? I purchased this to automatically turn on when I open my closets. The problem is, the ""ambient light"" required to activate the sensor is only satisfied by a bright light, not dim hallway lights or sunlight. If you're purchasing this so you DON'T have to turn on your bright light or because you don't have a bright light, then this is not the product for you. I'd suggest a motion detector light. I boughtSE Wireless Motion Sensor Light - 10 Super-Bright LEDfor my closets to replace these and they are working quite well AND are cheaper.Other than that, this is a great product, they just shouldn't sell it with an auto-sensor. It is much brighter than other push on lights I've had and the swivel feature is nice."
5,Perfect for Closets!,I love these lights! I put them in each one of the closets in my house and they work great because they turn on automatically when we open the closet doors! Don't get me wrong...they are not exactly bright enough to light an entire room but they are perfect for finding shoes and clothes in the closet! We bought a second 3 pack and put one in the pantry and one at the top of the basement. Great buy!
3,Poor construction,One of the 3 units did not work. A very fine wire broke away from it solder connection. I hope to be able to fix it.
3,Puck lights OK,"Purchased 2 packages for extra light inside kitchen pantry. When you open door, if you are kind of blocking tthe light from room, they will flash like a strobe instead of just turning on. Within 1 day had a problem with one, stopped working, had trouble hetting batteries out and not contacts are no good. Fortunately have a replacement due to ordering 6. Would probably buy again as they are bright but sensor is a little sensitive."
2,Dim Purchase,"The description says ""super bright."" This is not consistent with what I'm seeing. I can see some utility in a truck box or an otherwise unlit closet, but I was hoping for a supplemental office light source that wouldn't kick off heat. These don't produce much light, and so are useless for reading."
1,Disappointed,"I was planning on using them in an understaircase pantry. Put out very little light. If there is not much light in kitchen, when open pantry door, they would not come on. Worthless for intended use. Don't think would be much use in a closet either. They are going into a garage sale. Maybe I can get 75 cents for them, but will probably not get anything."
5,This book is a must-buy.,"This book is a must-buy, or at least a must-have. If you like logic, you must have this book -- for it'll give you what you like. If you don't like logic, you must have this book -- for it'll snap you out of your (misplaced) dislike. You either like logic or you don't. You figure it out!Truly, this book is a wonderful collection suited for anyone competent in classical first-order logic. Indeed, it serves as a rather nice second step into the world of logic beyond classical first-order. At the very least the book offers the best (informal) introductions to Goedel's celebrated theorem, which is worth a lot.Anyone familiar with Boolos' work will know that this book is a treat. Anyone not familiar with Boolos' work must learn; and ~Logic, Logic, and Logic~ is a great place to start."
5,Smack in the face of religion,"It is like a hand started from the hip and with great force and speed, it reached out to smack relgion. (...)This should be mandatory reading so childen can grow up to be free thinkers and not demoted to be controlled by some half brain religious fanataics."
2,Shadows of forgotten ancestors,Another book on evolution by a populist author not really for the serious Biology student. Read Origin of the species for the real thing Or the Beak of the Finch for good research into natural selection on the Galapagos. Sagan once again falls down on his interminable belief that we can find life on other planets. On the good side this book brings to the layman the evolution story written in good prose however it repeats most of his previous excursions into this subject. We all have one book in us and this is Sagan repeat. Sad when he could have utilised his brain to research black smokers and chemobacteria to more effect

1,How does this prove we came from apes?,"If we evolved from apes then shouldn't our bodies be completely covered with hair? You'd think they should, but no. Why did we lose our hair then, what benefit would that be? Hair is an important thing for survival, otherwise most other animals would've lost it too. But, then, why did we lose our hair? Well, maybe we didn't come from apes!Evolution is probably flawed, and Creationism doesn't explain how God was created. So, I opt for the agnostic view of things. Perhaps someone else is responsible for life on earth, such as aliens or something (don't ask me who created the aliens, I don't have a clue). For further reading I suggest Erich von Daniken."
5,The best book to comprehend ourselves,"In Cosmos, Sagan wrote that the best way for an alien to measure our science was to see how much we know about ourselves. This book is just about it. Sagan and Druyan shows the evolution from the first organic sign to the man, and help to explain WHY we are the way we are. It is a very well written book and, above all, a book of science. One of the best I ever read."
5,A testament to our ancestors.,"In this, Carl Sagan's greatest, along with Cosmos, he teaches not to feel ashamed, but humbled by our ancestors who paved the path, millions of years in the making, for us! He teaches us to have the same attitudes for our descendents as our ascendants had for us. The book attempts to distinguish the differences between us and other species on earth, one that shows that we, especially as humans, are not as different as we thought. Do not be deceived by people who try to tell you humans are the god given species on this planet, for Carl points out that we are actually the lucky one's, and we should not take it for granted. Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors is a must read for anyone who wishes to find out who they really are and why."
5,Classic piece by an iconic American scientist,"Carl Sagan made the unreachable a popular topic for the American people with his clarity of expression and iconic style. I recently gave this book to my son, who is now a doctoral student at a major university. He is among the new generation of Carl Sagan devotees. You won't be disappointed to learn more about how Carl Sagan and his wife, Ann Druyan, contemplated the origins of humanity in this vast universe."
5,Greatest. Book. Evar.,"This book will take you from the beginning of our universe and trace our evolutionary steps. While never too technical, it will help you understand some pretty complex ideas such as DNA replication, evolutional theories, competition, dominance and submission, sex and much more.If you ever wanted to know who you are, you should get this book."
1,"Junk ball, avoid",This ball fell apart after only 6 months of occasional usage. The court surface is smooth finished concrete. When I first used the ball I noticed the composite leather was starting to chip away every time the ball hit the rim. Then after 6 months the cover is coming off which makes the ball useless. I bought a Spalding and I noticed the cover isn't chipping away like this crap ball. I would avoid any basketball made by Wilson
3,It's not the blues but it's not bad!,"Found this record in the blues section of a rare jazz record shop. Thinking it would be interesting to hear Brazilian blues, picked it up. It is not blues but it is kind of a pop, a little Funky in spots and MOR. A few ballads. I guess Valenca to be singer/songwriter, like a Brazilian James Taylor"
3,"Pretty good, not bad, can't complain","I enjoyed the size (non-huge) & pace of this book, as well as the setting (the Nevada desert & ranch land, largely). But in a brief book, I suppose it's tough to have characters that don't seem one-dimensional. In this book, many of them do; after you've met them the first time, little else about them will come as a surprise. Still, the dialogue and descriptions are generally well done, and the progression of the main character from Grey Flannel Suit to His Own Man is interesting to watch. How WOULD somebody go about throwing their old life away for a new one, and what would bring that about? Fun questions, and this book explores them in an intriguing way.For those who can relate to middle-aged-male angst and like to read mysteries, Peter Robinson's Inspector Banks books will probably be at least as enjoyable as Blue Lonesome."
5,"4.5 stars. McFestus enjoyed, And it's a fast read.","Younger middle-aged San Franciscan looks into the life of a woman he has only known briefly. He goes back to her small desert home town and finds it full of secrets and hidden agendas. Evocative, moody, and atmospheric. What a great title too."
4,The Backup Singer,"The Backup Singer focuses on Shanice Stevenson, a teenager in a small Ohio town who sings backup for a talented garage band. Things are going well for Shanice; she has a great group of friends, a loving family who surrounds her, and the band is starting to get some gigs. Her cousin Tawny, who lives in Detroit, is also coming for the summer. Shanice and Tawny have always gotten along like sisters, until now.Shanice is biracial while Tawny is black. Her cousin's taunts plant doubts in Shanice's mind and her internal struggle about who she is and where she fits in flows over into her relationships with her friends and her family. As her struggle deepens, she begins to withdrawal from her closest friends. Will she sever the ties altogether or realize true friendship reaches past your looks and into your soul?"
4,Bedtime stories,"Dick Summer is a great story teller! Whether you are familiar with Dick from his Loving Touch books of poetry or from his career in radio, you will welcome this CD. The CD should also create new fans for Dick's warm and soothing style of narration.Dick says his father and mother used to read bedtime stories to him. His father spoke of adventure and his mother read him poetry.Dick's bedtime stories are about love. They're told from the standpoint of a man speaking to a woman. They are about mature love, immature love, requited and unrequited love and even illicit love.Dick's delivery is also very smooth and intimate. From some of the stories, I felt as if he were saying things I haven't got the words to say. A woman listening will most likely feel that Dick is speaking directly to her.I'm an unabashed Dick Summer fan and I recommend this CD."
5,Bedtime Stories by Dick Summer,"If you grew up in the northeast in the '60s and '70s, you know that Dick Summer was the king of late night radio! He wasn't a bombastic monarch of the airwaves, but a soothing, reassuring and entertaining storyteller. When I first found out about this CD, it was like meeting up with an old friend! You'll enjoy these stories ESPECIALLY if you have company at bedtime ; )! They'll definitely enhance the experience. Even if you're not familiar with Mr. Summer's work, get this CD for some bigtime bedtime fun..."
1,Save your money,This is a real low budget production. You can hear the reader's timer go off multiple times and hear him clicking his mouse during the audio review. He basically reads straight from a NASD rule book and makes no effort to put the information in plain terms. His voice is monotone and makes no emphasis on key points or topics. It seems he doesn't really have a grasp on the information he is reading by how he pronounces certain words and abbreviations like IRA. It is almost impossible to drive and comprehend what your listening to. I would stick with a good Series 7 Review book.
2,Bloomsday or Doomsday,"This film reinforces my belief that some books cannot be translated to film. The depth of imagination required to follow and appreciate the intricate interweaving of the Ulysses story/plot/action can only, as far as I know, be achieved within the human mind. The movie industry simply doesn't have the technology to achieve such a feat on the screen. This was a valiant effort, but my anticipated visual bloomsday felt more like a doomsday."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"An utterly puerile production. I have seen better acting in school plays and primary school plays at that. How could anyone believe that Buck Mulligan was a student ... even a mature student? One reviewer thought Stephen Rea's rendering of Bloom was memorable in its vulnerability - it looked more like stage fright to me.It contains practically nothing of the character of the book, and why start with Molly? or was that just to catch the attention of the prurient.The pace of the film was painfully slow which of course made it impossible to capture the constant turmoil in the minds of the characters.One of the charms of the novel was the change in style from episode to episode in which the film Ulysses (1967) was at least partially successful.Do not waste time with this. Watch the 1967 version."
3,They could have done better with the source material,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but it was a struggle to watch to the end. Watch it only if there's nothing else."
3,feels good going on but not much for healing/protection,"I like this product but I am not in love with it. It is ultra smooth going on and smells great with a nice honey scent. But I don't think it does very much to keep my lips protected other than just after I have put it on. But for just a little something to keep in your purse to freshen up, it is fine. I still prefer Carmex for chapped lips in the winter. That stuff stinks to high heaven but it does really work well."
1,This stuff really stinks!,"If you just read the ingredients of this product you would think that it would smell nice and be very moisturizing. Not so! This lip balm has a funky odor and feels very rough when you apply it to chapped lips. Not only that, when your lips are really chapped, it stings! Not exactly what your going for when your lips are hurting already. In all, I think they could have come up with a better product."
1,Not what you'd expect,"I agree with the other reviewers that said you should stick with the original flavor. this honey one is very grainy, doesn't go on smooth at all, and doesn't taste very good. dont be daring with the honey flavor. if you wanna try something else, try the pomegranate flavor. that one is pretty good, way better than the honey but nothing is as good as the original. so in conclusion, dont buy this flavor, cuz i guarantee if you're a burt's bee fan and you buy the honey one, you're gonna wish you'd listened to us!"
2,Terribly rough cut,Maybe I got a bad one... The cut is very rough (much worse than the 15 year old blade it's replacing) and the blade makes a thump-thump with each revolution. It seems the joint in the band isn't quite straight (I can see the back of the blade bulge out as the joint passes by as I spin the wheels by hand). I think this one is going back.
5,Excellent book of baseball's history!,"Great book for people of all ages who love baseball!! Got it for my husband, and he enjoyed it greatly!!"
1,moonrise,"Moonrise by Anne Stuart.This was ordered by mistake, so I thought I would read it anyway. I was very disappointed. The storyline was looking good but then,way too many 4 letter words and blasphemy in it to make it enjoyable for me.I gave up after a few chapters. J Wilson"
2,my least favorite of this authors------,"plain and simple this book just did not ""ring my bell"".it was just dark and unappealling to me.i found myself skipping through to the end just so i knew how it ended then i put it away.instead of reading this i would suggest""ritual sins"" or an anthology of some of her shorter stories ""looking for trouble"",the latter being a trifle more light hearted with some humor involved."
5,Dark and Sexy,"Wow, I'm glad I came across this book. What a great story, but it's so dark . . . and sexy. It's quite the captivating and twisted read and from reading descriptions and reviews of other Anne Stuart books I think I'll be reading some of her others. I love the combination of scary and seductive at the same time."
3,Ok....,This was just ok. I couldn't relate to the heroine steadfast commitment to the hero no matter how she was treated.
2,More thriller than romance,"Interesting revenge/murder/whodunnit plot (though the bad guy becomes clear fairly early, in my opinion), but not really my thing. The romance does not get going until quite a ways in, and then it comes off as a little...abusive? inappropriate? unpleasant? Barely any humor to lighten the bleakness, either. Not something to read if what you want is a romance with a murder plot."
2,Disappointing,"This book felt forced. The characters weren't all that believable, there was a lot of repetition - almost as bad as those ""reality"" shows that take 10 minutes of actual story and draw it out to half an hour by repeating sound bytes over and over. I think she was trying for a steamy thriller, but it fell way short. It wasn't all that well proofread, either, which I find incredibly annoying. Final complaint was the missing white space, so it was like reading a badly cut movie with scenes out of order. I think this is a general e-book failing, because I've found it on several."
2,Too Dark and Gloomy.,Didn't bond with the characters at all. Too much of the storyline was repetitive. Not my idea of a romance. Ending was a disappointment.
2,"Plodding, repetitive, and slow moving","I don't understand how people gave this such great reviews. I'm more than halfway through the book and the author says the same thing over and over and over again on every page. All she has said so far in a nutshell is, James is a killer, Annie is drawn to him and attracted to him even though he's got no soul, Annie was manipulated by her father. The author reiterates those three ideas on almost every single page.I officially cannot finish this book."
3,A few good women would have helped poor Annie,"Moonrise was a well written story with a very harsh awakening for our main character. When Annie's DC bureaucrat father is killed, Annie's suspicious grow that his death was murder. Her father's last letter to her directed her to his prodigy, James McKinley, who, after her father's death and funeral retreated to Mexico. Annie's ex-husband, Martin, encourages her to go to James when she talks to him about her suspicions. Like a lamb to the slaughter, Annie has been born and bred to a life of deception and brutality. As she discovers who the men around her really are, she discovers a strength of will and self-awareness that will help her survive all the traps ahead of her. Her beauty and innocence is her only weapon against a group of men who are natural born killers.My only question is - where the heck are the women in her life?"
4,Entertaining as usual,Her books all seem to be very similar. The male lead is alway dark and self loathing. The female is usually innocent and not completely attractive. The setting is dark and dangerous. Then she just inserts a new plot. I can't complain though because I like her books and her writing style.
2,Ann Stuart at her worst,"Ann Stuart's writing is not for everyone, but I usually find her books riveting and a welcome change in romantic reading. The heroes are rough and cruel and the sex scenes (lots of them) are not tender and warm, which is ok as long as there is growth and change in the relationships and the heroes themselves.Not so in Moonrise: The heroine is a cluless wimp who does not learn anything from start to end. She is afraid of the hero but wants him, without realizing anything about herself or him throughout the book. The hero loves her but hates her, drawn to her but hates her, wants to protect her but hates her... Its tiresome.And lastly - the plot is unreasonable, and you end the book still not knowing what went on and why. Leave this one alone and read instead Ruthless."
3,Moonrise got a rise out of me!,"This was not a typical romance/suspense book! It was dark, exciting, a mile-a-minute adventure. James MacKinley was a killer; Annie Sunderland about the only person in the world who could get under his skin and boy, was it tough!A 1996 book by Anne Stuart and not for the feint of heart. Very moving in many ways but not a romance that is smooth and sweet! This book had grit and one cannot put it down until the story is resolved.Becoming a big fan of Anne Stuart's."
3,Did he love her?,"Unpopular as I may be I have to say that this book wasn't what I expected based on all the great reviews received here. James McKinley, a very dark, dangerous man sets out to help Annie Sutherland, daughter of a man he loved as a father, find her father's killer. They are constantly pursued by assasins who want to end their lives to keep them for getting too close to the truth about an organization but the thing is that James wasn't ever really decent to Annie. How she could fall in love with such a man is beyond me. Ms. Stuart's books always have a dark and dangerous character that loves but doesn't want to admit it and protects but while this guy did protect when needed, where is the love? I have enjoyed all lf Ms. Stuart's other books especially Black Ice and Cold as Ice were favorites but this one.... not even close."
4,"Slow starting, but it gets better","It was a little slow at the start, I am about half way through the book. The characters are interesting and I like the story line."
4,Good but lacks depth,"Worth reading for some intersting facts, but I prefer the similar ""Vital Dust"" by Christian de Duve, which seems to convey far more information in the same number of pages, although it is also less easy to read. Microcosmos also contains one surprising error that creationists will like, by stating wrongly that no species has ever been seen to evolve into a new species."
2,vague and lacking substance,"disclaimer: I am not a native speaker (but quite used to read englich).I found the book quite vague and lacking in details, some images would have helped further. I did not expect an undergraduate book with many chemical formulas, but many ideas seemed only sketched. I can not say that anything is really wrong but I was left with the impression that the claims were not really substantiated.I am now reading ""the origins of life"" (Smith and Szathmáry) which -- while even shorter and somewhat dense -- I like much more. It is more precise and the authors clearly tell, what is substantiated ""knowledge"" and what is speculation. They even avoid using under-defined jargon like ""complexity"" with a refreshing acknowledgment of their own limitation in giving a clear definition."
2,Can someone please buy these guys a tuner???,"I'd have to say this album definitely has the potential to be great. There's a lot of energy coming from the band, especially the vocals. But what immediately turned me off to this album is the horns. I don't think I've ever heard an album from a signed band that is as out of tune as this one. As soon as the horns start playing you can tell unmistakebly that they are not in tune at all with the rest of the instruments. I don't see how they could overlook that. They should have noticed after recording the very first song that something wasn't right, but instead let it go for another 20 songs. If everything had been in tune, this album would definitely rock and I would give it at least a 4, but instead it gets a 2."
3,Too much Burgundy and too little new world...,"I've always (up to now) been a fan of Parkers books. In my opinion, he's always managed to give a thorough description of all areas he has visited - since last book issue.. This is not the case for 'Wine buyers guide, 5th edition' ! First of all, 500 pages (of 1700 in total) on Burgundy alone is waaay over the top (unless you are a burgundy devote, of course !) On the other hand, it seems like mr. Parker still hasn't recognised the potential in many new areas of the world (ie NZ, here look for James Hallidays EXCELLENT wine companion instead) And what about the emerging South Africa ? As stated by other reviewers, other parts of France don't get their fair share and - you can certainly do better that that on Germany, Bob ! Even though I've bought the book - and in some way, feel it covers the newer vintages, I cannot help feeling let down, considering earlier editions. So...I only give it an 86 out of 100 ! (eat that, Bob)"
3,"Informative, but...","Many if not most of the wines Parker rates highly here are very hard or nearly impossible to obtain. An ambitious project like this really makes no sense in today's wine market because it takes so long to compile the information. Today, the most deisrable bottles are either snapped up right away by collectors, incredibly expensive, or available only through winery mailing lists and clubs.Parker is a great stylist and keen observer, especially of Bordeaux and California, and the most valuable sections are the introductions to each region, which offer suggestions on producers to look for and broad trends in winemaking.<P...."
2,"Good advice, but you've got to hurry!","As I said in another review: ""Love Parker or bash Parker, just about every American wine lover pays attention to what he says. We have to ... his ratings make the market move as the wines he rates fly off the shelves."" These guides (this paperback and the hardcover edition) incorporate hundreds of his tasting reports from his Wine Advocate. Although the realities of book publishing mean that some of the wines are gone from the market before the Buyer's Guide reaches the shelves, if you follow Parker or intend to buy the wines he reviews, this volume is an important tool"
2,Big disappointment,"Comparing this to his compendium on Bordeaux, I must say that this one is quite disappointing. It's true that he tries to cover the world in this book, but he ends up saying very little about everything. His coverage of Australia is particularly dismal which I find unjustified."
3,"Much work from RP, but mostly on the wrong subject","At first I was surprised by the hughe amount of wines and wineries the author described. That must have been a lot work for him. But the result doesn't always convince me. It seems, Mr Parker doesn't like German wine. Although every serious wine journalist says that german Riesling is the Queen of grapes and its wine, esp. the old botrytis-sweet Rieslings and Eiswein are the best white wines in the world, Mr Parker doesn't review one single wine producer. SHAME ON YOU; Mr Parker. Overall I think this book is not for the wine lover but only for serious wine collectors who spend hundereds if not thousands of $ for wine. I prefer the publications of Hugh Johnson or Mr. Broadbent, although they are not 100 % convincing, too."
2,The Frank Rich of the wine world,"If you like Frank Rich's theater reviews, Parker is for you. The only thing he seems to care about is selling himself.This isn't just a criticism of this book, but of all Parker's world. He rates wine on a scale of 50 - 100. If a wine scores 82 is it really 5 better than one that scores 77? What does this mean? Wine is something that should be enjoyed with friends, not scored like a college exam. I don't rate my friends from 50 - 100, and I don't rate wine this way. On a more technical level, he trys to taste all his wine straight from the barrel before bottling. This is just plain silly. You don't judge a cake by eating flour and raw eggs. You taste the finished product.If you want good wine advice, then buy books by Hugh Johnson or Oz Clarke or Jancis Robinson."
2,Too Predictable,"This novel tells the story of the four Season sisters . When they gather for youngest sister Merry's funeral they are presented with the chance to confront a family secret that has festered for nearly thirty years. As they gather for the funeral each of the Season sisters is awash in her own problems. Investigating an old family secret gives them the opportunity to face their own demons, as well as to fulfill Merry's dying wish. If the plot sounds a bit hackneyed, that's because it is. The plot is entirely predictable. At no point was I surprised, and I saw the end coming from a mile away. The writing is also clunky. The prose is littered with excess detail, which serves no real purpose. Ultimately this book was far too predictable and sentimental to be enjoyable."
5,"Great drawings, catchy text","My preschool-aged twins really enjoyed this book. Since they like to be with me EVERYWHERE I go, I'm emphasizing the book's message that I love them no matter where I am or what I'm doing. They also enjoyed looking for and finding the heart on each page."
5,I Love You All The Time,"""I Love You All The Time"" is a wonderful book I can read with my step daughter to remind her that I love her when I'm busy doing my work, and that I love her when she's away at her mom's house. The illustrations are clear, fun and colorful. The text is easy to read, and the lyrics are well written."
1,From bad to worse,"The illustrations in the book are basic, to be sure - I find them hard to love, way too cutesy and leaving no room for imagination. The text is fine, but a couple of the illustrations send messages that are objectionable in my mind - one shows a mom basically ignoring her kid while she gabs on with a friend at the coffee shop (kid wants a cookie, the implication is that mom will say ""no!"" even though she got herself a coffee), and the other shows a dad ignoring a dejected-looking kid on the playground, who is waiting to play basketball, while he talks on the phone. Unfortunately, my kid loves this book. I hate it and periodically hide it so I won't have to read it to him..."
5,Perfect book for your baby,"I bought this book when my son was just a few days old when I went to a local bookstore. I hadn't heard anything about it but when I read the title and read through the book, I just could help but feel that this would be perfect. It would help me repeat again and again what I felt as often as I would read the story. Three years later, a couple of hundred readings of this book later...I still read it or sing it to him from memory every now and then and feel as if it has some special significance for him. I highly recommend it."
5,I Love you.... This book,"I purchased this book 4 years ago for my son. The pictures are vivid in color and not to cluttered. My son would ask me to read it over and over until I was completely exhausted of hearing it.Now my daughter found the book and she is just in love with it. She too continuously asked me to read it over and over.Both children have completed each page by saying, ""...All the time.""My kids understand that I don't have to be around them for them to be loved. They know when I'm in the other room, especially while sleeping, that I love them. We have a discussion about each page and both kids learned new words by pointing out the items in the pictures. Like pencils, computer, kite, rain, etc."
1,An utter disappointment and waste of money,"I live in Central Asia, in a place where brown rice is unknown. I come back to the US and buy supplies for a year, paying for product and airfreight. This rice has almost no taste. There seems to be neither energy nor nutritional value. Eating it gives me nothing but irritation to have spent so much money and confined myself to a year of dead rice or no rice. Actually, it has accustomed me to not eating rice.The package was intact. The sell-by date was okay. I had never bought this brand before and I never shall again."
4,Nice selection of authentic curries,This copy I got is not a great printing but I was glad to find it. I had a copy in the past and I liked how Harvey Day described the uses of curries. He was the first person to explain to me that there is no one curry powder and no one reason/purpose or style for curries.
1,Irritating,"This product should not be marketed as a prep for any graduate school tests. I bought this set to study for the GRE and found that I could not use it as a study aid for more than ten minutes because Mazer's voice and anecdotes proved to be so irritating that they seemed condescending to me. These CDs may be helpful and enjoyable to young high school students studying for the SAT or ACT, but adults and college students should stay away!"
1,Gutter trash.,"Well, this would certainly expand your vocabulary.Normally, one would associate the idea of increasing your vocabulary with lifting yourself to a higher level and communication on a level that is a bit more dignified.If never want to associate with successful people of the world but you want to know what they are taking about then this is probably a CD for you. Or if you are in high school with run away hormones and want to impress your friends in the bathroom go for it.In the first few minutes you'll learn about the word abash by association with phrases like ""if your fly is open and people can see your private parts."" After that you'll have other examples to help you learn words where the examples are things like a woman ""posting nude photos of her over weight husband on the internet.""That's all in the first 5 minutes.The slang that is used in all the examples just further supports the idea that the CD's are for someone who's vocabularly is ""like totally cool.""Buy a dictionary."
4,Origins of WW1,There is a dearth of published research into this event which sent world history off in a different trajectory. This book explains the origins very well.
3,Somewhat diasppointing,"I found this product dificult to use properly. I wanted to recreate my own oddly shaped family room with its overly large fireplace. I was finally able to get the dimensions I wanted, but the only choice for fireplace was the standard one. I also don't feel that the furniture choices reflected actual sizes and styles available out there--I think the choices the designer used were quite limited. I have to admit, I used this once and found it easier to just do the thing myself on graph paper."
1,won't work well without 3D HOME ARCHITECT by Broderbund,"this software is ""OK""...BUT...you REALLY need 3D HOME ARCHITECT so you can IMPORTplans from rooms you have designed so you can then use 3D HOME INTERIORS to decorate the rooms you created on HOME ARCHITECT...YES, you can decorate rooms without it, provided your room is a plain square or rectangle with no alcoves, bay windows, closets, or other architectural elements ....the choices are extremely limited so far as cabinets, etc... if you have alot of patience to learn 3D HOME ARCHITECT , and to learn how to import your 3D HOME ARCHITECT designs over to 3D HOME INTERIORS....it's OK."
3,Too much info,I was looking foward to this based on the good reviews here but was disapointed. You have to fill in lot of details. So its not for everybody. What put me off was nursery details since we won't have a nursery that entire section would be blank for me. And going through it I realized that most of the pages will be empty for me so I wasn't thrilled with this book.I bought a great baby book at Babies R Us and love it.
2,"Didn't use it, gave it away","I didn't like it at all, and ended up giving it away. It's great if you want to write down every single time he does one thing new, but there are too many things and I only want to keep track of the important stuff! It was too frill and fluff for me!"
4,Beautiful Baby Book,This is a very pretty baby book. It works great for a boy or girl. It has pouches to store momentoes and a strap on the outside of the book to hold it together if it gets thick. It has some good photography and pretty quotes. I give it a four because it has no place for immunization records and baby teeth information. It does however have some blank pages that could be used for this but I would rather use those for pictures.
2,Waaaay too much detail for new parents to fill in,"I gave this book 2 stars because that's the ""I don't like it"" amount.First of all, the yellow binding on the cover had smudges that could not be removed. So be aware that it might not look nice and new.Secondly, I didn't realize how lengthy and detailed this book was until I got it... and I found it really excessive in that sense. Most new parents won't have the time, energy, or desire to fill in this book. But some will, of course. So if you find it important to keep a record of things like ""My child first focused his eyes on _(date)__"" and other minutiae, this might be the book for you. But if you're the type who just wants to enjoy the ride and record major life events, choose another -- like ""My Life as a Baby,"" which is short and sweet."
5,"Wonderful, Complete - Baby Journal","I had received one of these for my first son, and I didn't know if I would be able to find it again for our second son and I was able to find it on Amazon - so happy. It has so many great sections to complete and keep track of all those early moments before they are born and after they are born, I really enjoyed it for our first son and can't wait to use it and track our second son in the coming weeks. Also it has pockets to store stuff and you can find blank pages and other great places to fill with photo's as well and really personalize it. Wonderful baby book - would recommend to anyone and everyone."
5,"WOW, I LOOOOVE this jornal!!",I just love this journal! I had a wonderful journal for my pregnancy and was hoping to find one for my daughter that was just as good. This journal ended up being even better than I had imagined!!! You will LOVE it! So many pages and questions that you don't even think of... it will be treasured by my daughter when she gets older!
2,Very Detailed Baby Book,"I didn't end up using this baby book because it was so detailed. It was organized very nicely but there were so many ""firsts"" and other details that I knew I would never get to them, especially with this being my second child. I still don't have everything filled in in my first child's baby book, so I needed something not as detailed but which captured some important moments. I ended up using the Humble Bumbles' Baby Journal and I really like it."
4,Great!,"I bought this baby book for my sister. She needed one with evelopes instead of picutre slots. It was impossible to find one, but this book worked perfect. She loves it and said it was very comprehensive."
5,Best baby book I've found,"Love this book. It is fill in the blank style, but also has pockets to stash mementos. It also is spiral bound which is helpful if you want to save extra things as it allows the book to expand a little. The spial is covered by a canvas binding on the outside so it still looks nice on a shelf. I wish I had bought this before my LO was born as there are pages about your thoughts prior to the birth and a really cute page about the baby's first night. It does spell things in the great Britain version of English so don't buy it if that will bother you."
4,"Darling ""uni-sex"" Baby Book","Easy to keep some of the important events in your child's life. Pages are about the right length to document a happening, yet, short enough so you will probably record it."
3,only ok,I ordered this baby book when I was pregnant. I felt like it was lacking many of the milesones that come along. I ended up giving up and not even completing much of the book.Next baby I have I will order a different baby book.
4,very cute,"very, very cute and sweet journal. very pretty, and perfect for keeping memories about your baby. i bought this for my best friend and she loves it."
5,Works!,My daughter complained of water in her ear..used Mack's and she said it worked! I keep it in her swim team bag just in case.
2,Merely an author using 'research' to grind out tired 'adaptations' of myth.,"I thought I had found a book focusing on the various shapeshifting myths through different times and cultures. Instead I have a book of about seven stories 'adapted' by Zenko. I don't want to read a 'modern' retelling of a particular myth, I want a comprehensive collection of mythlore. True, each story is prefaced with a small mention regarding the basis for each of Zenko's stories, but it was a waste of time and money for research purposes."
3,long winded Eloise,"This is the typical cute Eloise stories, but in a longer verson. My daughter who loves Eloise got board with the first story half way through. She is young and is getting used to longer stories, but even I was glad when she said she did not want to hear anymore for that night."
5,It starts with Eloise.,"To the father who wonders what he's missing, I can only say ""It's a girl thing."" So many of us long to be outspoken, daring and fashionable--a ""Woman in Crescendo,"" as Sophia Loren put it. And yet we haven't achieved it yet; we're still in training, just like Eloise. That's why little girls (and big ones!) are so perpetually enchanted with her, and why this collection is absolutely essential for someone raising daughters. Bombshell training can never start too soon!"
4,I'd rawther not!,"All of Eloise's most memorable adventures together in one book, what a joy, joy joy! Me and Skipperdee love it!"
1,book,I wanted this book to look at the bead work and get ideas for my projects. This book is full of wonderful pictures and is very well done.
5,An excellent book!,"This is by far the very best book I have ever seen on the subject! It will no doubt take days to just look at the beautiful pictures. The author, Lois Sherr Dubin, has outdone her previous book, ""The History Of Beads"", which I also highly recommend. This book follows thousands of years of Native adornment, dividing the continent into sections such as the Arctic, the Plains, the Southwest, and more, and goes into the jewelry, symbolism, and purpose of these exquisite artworks in great detail. I had never seen most of the photographs in this book before, and the text is most informative as well. I simply cannot say enough good things about this book, and I'd give it ten stars if I could! The author has obviously put much thought, time, and careful research into this wonderful book!"
3,Not the Full Edition,"This is a lovely work but I bought it without realizing that the ""CONCISE""edition is somehow abbreviated. I had spent time with the book belonging to a friend and wanted to buy one. However, this book is much smaller. Without comparing both books, I would have no way of determining what is missing. Even with this disappointment, I think that perhaps the concise edition makes sense. It is chock full of beautiful photos and there are two fold out pages that have three pages worth of illustrations and photos on both sides.I'm thinking it's not a bad buy. It's just not what I thought I was buying. My bad."
1,North American Indian Jewelry and Adornment,"I received my copy of this book with the expectation, like several others who have reviewed this book, that it was 600 pages of material. This is woefully short of the full version. I had to go back to the listing to see if there was a disclaimer and the title does include the words concise edition.I am not a professional in this field and had no idea that there were two versions. I feel mislead since the bigger description said clearly that it was hardcover. Most lesser editions of titles I'm familiar with are published in softcover. The description should have made a full disclaimer NOT THE FULL 600 PAGE ORIGINAL EDITION."
4,Don't think twice,"Don't think twice is an easy read, for someone who just wants something to pass time. Basically, what you see is what you get. The main character Anne is a 17 yr old girl, who gets pregnet by her boyfrind Jake. Throught the book,she finds herself. I think this book is ment for a younger age group, but still, entertaining none the less."
3,Ahhh,"Well, this book was okay. It didnt spark any tears or cause any laughter. it was kind of blah. a lot of the time it kind of bored me."
3,Don't Think Twice,"This book wan't bad. It was very real. It showed the view of what a pregnant teenage girl goes through. It also shows how a home for these girl's can help. they go through all kinds of things. The main charter of the story,Anne doesn't want to get along with anybody and the other girls try to be her friend, but she just wants to be by herself. She just wants to be independent, since she's so used to it. her family doesn't support her at all during her whole pregnancy. They write her once in a while, but nothing is really said about where she is and why she's there. They tell how hard it is to have a baby and give it upfor adoption and try and move on with their lives as if it had never happened."
5,Hey you! Buy this book!,"Okay, okay, okay. I'm not an editor. I don't know the author. All I know is what I like. And I either like it or I don't. Well, as soon as I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down. It was just so... it was sad, yeah and funny and heart-breaking, so so real. Okay, the main character Anne, lived in like 1967 but she reminded me so much of myself... without the pregnant part. It was honest and believable. Very sad, but I liked it. And I didn't even realize it would be so hard to give up a baby. So, read it"
3,It hurts and sparkles.,"This brush head really isn't that different from the other Crest Spin Brush Pro brush heads. The only difference I have experienced is that the bristles have pretty sparkles in them, and there is a rubber scrapper in the head.It claims to whiten teeth, probably with the scrapper, but it really just irritates mine. Don't use it if you have sensitive teeth, like I do.I did not notice any whitening, and neither did my friends."
5,Family Favorite,We started using these Crest toothbrushes about 5-6 years ago. They are a family favorite. They do a really good job and make tooth brushing much quicker than using a regular toothbrush. They're pretty inexpensive compared to a lot of the other powered toothbrushes.I recommend these to all my friends and family.
1,The Pharmacy Technician's Pocket Drug Reference,I am really disappointed in this edition. The listings are not comprehensive or thorough.It is not what I was looking for at all. Roxannna Cecco
2,It's not really small enough...,"It wont tuck nicely into your lab coat about half of it fits, snug and the top half sticks out. As for the inside...I haven't found a use for it yet. The days I had it at work with me, there was no need to pull it out and the days I didn't have it, I didn't miss it. I'll hold on to it, it may come in useful at some point, just not yet."
3,Pharm Tech Poc DR,I ordered and received the book in a timely manner. I will purchase items from the seller in the future.
3,Your favorites don't always go well together,"I love Ray Charles singing. I love big band music playing. But like salsa and ice cream, favorites don't always go well together. Ray does have a strong enough voice so he isn't overshadowed by the band, but it's not the best use of his voice to have so much competition from the instrumentation. I voted this as ok, it does have some nice songs, but he could have done most of the songs without such a heavy big band sound. I am sorry I don't like this better."
3,Ray Charles and Basie review,"We liked this cd., but have only listened to it once. It's good but not extraordinary."
1,faking and industry crass commercialism,"This is the recording that never was. One will never know what the original ray charles tapes sounded like--all we know from the liner notes is that much was unuseable and that through the genius of modern technology, ray charles' lyrics were improved and melded with an improvised new basie (after the Count) band's music. Whether Ray would have wished it his way or did it this way is an unknown and the effort, in the circumstances, exploits an artist and his public to improve the bottom-line of a recording company. That, in my view, is a sad commentary on the state of today's music ""industry."""
5,I love this CD,This CD is an unique musical collaboration that combines the soulful sweet lyrics of Ray Charles and the delightful sound of the current Count Basie orchestra. Every instrument sounds perfect on this disc. I love the trumpet and trombrone playing throughout this disc. Ray Charles conveys a range of emotions with his voice on this CD. He expresses such joy on the tracks Oh What A Beautiful Morning and Let The Good Times Roll. I Can't Stop Loving You and Come Live With Me are two very romantic soulful love songs. Georgia On My Mind is an unique song about the love for a state. It is a beautiful track and a very touching state song. I love the playfulness in Ray's voice on the tracks Every Saturday Night and Busted. I love the tone in Ray's voice on the track The Long And Winding Road. He sounds so wise and sensual. Feel So Bad is a lively song about losing a loved one. This CD is filled with beautiful music.
1,"...an ""excellent use of technology,"" but is it good?","This may be an ""excellent use of technology,"" but is it good? I don't think so. Yes, Ray sings and yes, the Basie band (not Basie) swings (a little), but what I hear is not a real synergy. To my ears, which have heard both Ray and The Count (not together) live on many occasions, this CD sounds fake and contrived. This is not Basie's book it's Ray's, and the band just does not fit with the C&W hits and the other Charles classics. I had high hopes for this album as I am a fan of both Ray and The Count. Call me a stinker, but I've been listening critically for close to forty years and this one just does not cut it."
4,"It is what it is, and I like it","I was standiing in a well known book store a while back, suffering through Rod Stewart's Still the Same...Great Rock Classics Of Our Time, when finally a young employee put me out of my misery with this great recording. What a breath of fresh air! Compared to Rod's yawning, lifeless, ""the tape is full, when do I get paid?"" sounding recordings, here is Ray belting it out with all the soul and power that few could ever possess. Sure, I found out later, that we had been a wee bit had, that this was a bit of ""aural Photoshopping"". but what a great job it was. As a graphic designer, I have created many pieces by splicing 2 or 3 separate photos together. This CD is sort of like that. As long as the purchasers of this work know this before they buy it, I see no problem. It is what it is - a beautiful piece of music, and I like it."
5,"""Genius"" In More Than One Way!","Through the technical-mixing wizzardry of our age, the combination of Ray Charles' keyboards and vocal mix, and Count Basie's great orchestra, blend perfectly...just if it was a real,live performance! This is a remarkable collect of some great songs! A must for your library. Crank-up the volume and enjoy!"
1,Awful gimmick . Sadness.,"I don't care how good the songs may appear to sound.This a complete fake and I am concerned that these mash ups will initiate a trend.... ""Shakira sings Misty with Wes Montgomery"", anyone ? Ridiculous !This is utterly unacceptable. My 2 cents."
4,review: essential readings in juvenile justice,"I ordered this book last Thursday, it's only Monday and it's already here! I was really happy with its condition. The outside has maybe a scrape, but the inside (the part that matters) is like NEW! im very happy with my purchase!"
4,They Never Came Home,"I thought this was a great book. It had a lot of mystery in it which I rarely ever read. It's about two friends that go on a hiking trip and never come home. After the families had agreed to end the search party, a man calls the Drayfus household to tell them that their son owed him a lot of money. This particular chapter is a critical one because that is when it takes a complete turn around. This book contains a lot of fears and mystery which makes it great I highly recommend it."
4,They Never Came Home Review,"This book is way cool!! It had a twist and was really good. The only 2 things I didn't like about it was that some of the parts were boring and the end seemed rushed. I wish the end was more drawn out, but otherwise I liked reading the book a lot! It's really good!"
5,I really liked it and I couldn't take my eyes away from it!,"I really liked the book ""They never came Home"" by Lois Duncan becase it kept my attention in all parts where they went to the chapter about David and Lance! I think they should have told us before they changed their names beacause I got really confused when I was reading that part! Other than that, it was pretty great!"
3,This book should never come home,"This isn't the best book iv'e read or the worst.The book they never came home is by Lois Duncan and it is about two hikers that disapeered in a mountain.Their family turn frantic but they are still alive.I gve this book a three out of five.At the end you wonder if Lance is going to return for vengence and payback. It makes you wonder why she wrote this book if she can write 'I know what you did last summer but this book still deserves a good score because of the story, character, settings and events but it doesn't wow me. You can live without it because it won't change your life."
2,Bored to death,"""They never came home"" written by Lois Duncan was about two bots who never came home. Wow,does that sound very intresting to you well it does not to me. If you like books with a slow pace then this is the one for you."
2,Board to death,"In my honest opinion ""They never came home"" by Lois Duncan is the most boring book I've ever read. It's about two boys named Dan and Larry who get lost in the mountian's and never come home. After a throgh search in the mountian's every one gives them up for dead,including Joan who is Dan's girlfriend and Larry's sister. Joan belives that there dead but some hints prove other wise. If you don't like toread slow and boring books don't read this one. In the begining it is really boring and the end leaves you asking questions. By the time you get to the middel of the book you don't even care what hapened to Larry and Dan."
2,Nothing Special,I would have to say that this novel did not do a good job keeping the reader interested yet at times it did have good scenes. It rushed the intense scenes and left the readering feeling indifferent at the end. Louis Duncan did do a good job creating a variety of differnt characters with different personalites but did not develop them very well. I would not recommend this book.
2,Bored to death,"In my honest opinion ""They never came home"" by Lois Duncan is the most boring book I've ever read. It's about two boys named Dan and Larry who get lost in the mountain's and never come home. After a through search in the mountain's every one gives them up for dead, including Joan who is Dan's girlfriend and Larry's sister. Joan believes that there dead but some hints prove other wise. If you don't like to read slow and boring books don't read this one. In the beginning it is really boring and the end leaves you asking questions. By the time you get to the middle of the book you don't even care what happened to Larry and Dan."
1,Kat's 11433 review,"Three new Kat's 11433s have been installed in my 1981 Chevy Luv diesel pickup truck. Each new unit failed within three days - guess I am a slow learner.Amazon's service has been good - the Kat's product, terrible."
3,Too easily tripped.,"Works OK, and I've relocated many a rodent with this model, but there is a better choice now from TomCat that doesn't get nearly as many false trips."
1,Cheap plastic too thin - mouse chewed right through,"I bought three of these not only because they are a humane option (killing is NOT an option in my house) but because of their price. I set them out at night and checked them in the morning. Nothing for two days. Then on the third morning I noticed a pile of black shavings under the door which was about 75% closed. The mouse had gone in, ate the peanut butter, then chewed the plastic and got out. These are too cheaply made. Don't waste your money. I just purchased the more expensive greenfeet trap to see if that works. I also had tried making my own from a soda bottle - didn't work either."
1,Not working for me,"I followed all the instructions on the box, but so far I've only caught one mouse out of 8 attempts! The other 7 traps contained the slight remains of peanut butter and a lot of mouse droppings. This was a HUGE disappointment to me."
3,confusing-killed three meesies,These traps are cheap. I too have the Have a Heart trap and they work much better. These traps give the impression that when a mouse is caught the trap tips backwards where the bait is. Their black and hard to see if anything is in there too. Three were killed because the directions weren't clear. They tip and close to easy.
5,for lovers of sci-fi and Dante alike....,"This is a truly wonderful book, that deserves a lot more attention than it got. Ryman has an incredible range, a gift for characterization, and has mastered the art for precise observation that he can nevertheless make iconic. This book is very ambitious - and he gets away with it. He weaves together Marx, the theory of relativity, hologram productions of Dante, vampires, and genetic engineering - and it works. This is one of those books that I press into my friends' hands saying, ""You have got to read this."" Then I have to show up at their door to get it back because they love it so much that they don't want to give it back. If you like this book you should also read ""Was,"" Ryman's book that tackles ""The Wizard of Oz."" He is a truly great modern writer."
2,I didn't really enjoy it,"Take your chances with this book. I didn't like it really. I bought it because it was an award winner. And though the details of the story were cool, it was too pretentious for me to get into. I give 2 stars for originality and being able to convey the fantastic in rich detail. But there was nothing underneath it to hold it together. I just have to voice this opinion - you will of course make your own decisions. But the Marxism and the opera and the flash-back-forward-around was not so much impressive as tedious."
5,Review,"This is a great Work, I am very happy to have it as a part of my collection. If you are a jazz enthusiast, I highly recommend it."
3,An ill-fitting combination,"Banda El Recodo is a talented group. Juan Gabriel isn't afraid to experiment. One would expect great things from a joint effort. Well, you can tap your toe to it . . . Gabriel's voice just doesn't mesh well with an oomph, oomph, honk, honk stage sound. Even Gabriel signature pieces--""Costumbres,"" ""No me vuelvo a enamorar""--don't hold up in this album. Gabriel's voice sounds clipped, strained. The CD is also no bargain. Gabriel, usually generous in quantity, ends this release after only 33 minutes. With all due respect to all of the people involved in this project the combo just doesn't work very well. People who want to hear REALLY good Gabriel should spend their money on his Palacio de Bellas Artes live performance CDs and videos."
2,needs work,"Just heard the last track (15) on the internet radio (128 kbps), unless they had a distorted recording, I think she needs a bit more work. I give this CD a 2 (+) star because I didn't hear the whole disc, but based on what I heard (track 15, notes are closed to be off key), there is no 3-5 star."
3,A nice summary of '90s popular cooking.,"Morgan covers a variety of popular 1990s dishes in a nicely laid-out volume. The writing style, however, lacks the usual warmth that is characteristic of her co-author, Michael McLaughlin. I bought the book because of McLaughlin's name on the title page, and while I think it is generally OK, I definitely miss his usual imprint."
3,Fascinating glimpse of life in the jungle,"This book offers a fascinating view of life in the jungle of Brazil during the 1930's for a husband and wife team who set up camp and offer jaguar hunting expeditions. Along the way they build a home, raise a family and encounter many unusual experiences unique to jungle life, like being attacked by a tapir and army ants, and visiting the villages of Amazon natives. It's a spectacular glimpse of what the wild untamed Amazon jungle was like, and hopefully, still is."
4,A distrubing subject...but informative,"This book made it to the Young Adult Choices listing for this past school year and was a very big hit with the students at my Jr. High Library. Many of them were moved by the subject, but stated that it is one that should be discussed more. Very informative and gives the reader a sense of what is transpiring in US schools today. Subjects such as uniforms, home schooling, stereotyping, suicide, the history of school violence (ex: Columbine High) diversity & acceptance and suggested solutions are presented in an easy to read, informative manner. Many of my students have read this book just for ""fun"" (no assignment attached to it....)."
2,purchase,"I ordered 2 sets of chairs.The wood has a very nice finish, however one brace between the front legs had a horizontal split approximately 1/3 of the length of the wood. The company did replace the defective chair without question but I suggest that all pieces be checked before beginning assembly."
4,What you would expect,This bag was a nice size--not too large or too small--for a kids lunch bag. Outside pocket is handy for utensils or a snack. Comfortable handle. The velcro close gets a lot of tension with a packed lunch so we'll see how well that holds up (I couldn't find a bag with a zipper).
3,"really nice lunch sack, but watch for color","This lunch sack is really a great product. But the only issue I had was that Amazon sent me a red lunch sack, when the item was pictured as a blue lunch sack. So, I bought this lunch sack for my son and he was not too happy with the color. But we kept the lunch sack anyway and I use it instead."
5,SUPERB,"As an Exit Counselor, I found your publication very helpful in further helping me distinguish between mind control organizations and their effects on those who join. The author breaks his subject down to ""forces responsible in the Charismatic groups"". He also shows followers of these mind control organizations case histories of these groups. I find his book excellent because while he shows a description of these organizations, he also shows recovery principles. I recommend anyone reading this who knows someone who has been involved with not-only religious mind control organizations, but someone who has become involved with pyramid-scheme marketing companies and even people who exert a strong influence. I recommend you reading this publication so you can learn how people are influencing you to do things you may not want to do. Other recommended categories to research includes confidence schemes, mind-control and charismatic groups. This book is a recommended first-reading."
1,no toe room,"These shoes have very shallow toe room, they must be for people with thin toes. Not comfortable to wear when the shoe is pushing down on your toe nails"
2,"beautiful, but poorly made boots","I was originally very happy with these boots. The leather is beautiful and soft, and the boots were comfortable. They wore well with nice jeans and slacks. They are versatile enough to wear to the office or just on an outing.But after a few months of wear, the sole began to come apart at the seams from the upper part of the shoe. I had to toss the boots after only a few months. I had this happen with another pair of Unlisted shoes as well."
5,The funniest book in the series,"BOO HISS by Rene Gutteridge is the third in the series and my favorite. I don't know how she does it, but Gutteridge turns a 300-page ensemble comedy into a real page turner.All the characters are back from the first two books (you should probably read those first). The simple plot consists of town panic over a two headed pet snake getting loose and a new couple moving into town bringing unwanted changes. This is all the setup needed to turn the wacky characters loose and let them be themselves.The silly scenarios don't seem contrived, but instead are believable because they seem to be how each character would really react. This book also shines in the sections where Boone's agent goes to a Christian writer's conference, and where the entire town tries to put on a play.Comedy isn't normally a genre I read, but this book is a lot of fun, and I recommend the entire series."
2,Decent yoyo,"This yo-yo worked very well right out of the box, but over time the response system was starting to screw up...alot...I had to chance the friction stickers atleast 1 every 2 days, and that's pretty bad especially if you don't have a local store that sells that sort of thing. I wouldn't really recommend this yo-yo for a serious player. I'd suggest the Duncan Freehand Zero. Plus I didn't even get the color that I wanted. I thought since the photo was black, I would get the black one....."
4,Introduction to Information Systems,"The textbook is well written with examples to back up what it is talking about. It is presented in a well organized manner and concise in it's explanations. It is more helpful than some other textbooks I have used this year. It was sometimes difficult to read in some parts especially the hardware and software chapters, because of the subject matter and all of the jargin and labeling everything has. Overall I enjoyed this book and its content."
3,Relatively good,My name is Amanda. The course name is Business Information Systems. I liked the book as a whole. I felt that it was well written and easy enough to understand for the sudject matter. I also felt that difficult concepts were explained very well. The Illustrations and graphics in the book were well done.
3,Review on IS book,The course name that we are using this book for is Business Info Systems. I generally liked the book as a whole. It wasn't hard to understand considering the subject matter. Although I do not think that I will keep the book because much of the information will be out dated in the near future. Through out the book the charts and graphs were very helpful to me in trying to understand the subject. And the way that the material was laid out was very nicely done.
3,This book covers a lot of technical jargon.,"The text is a well written explanation on the technical side of Business Information systems. It covers everything, from the basic knowledge to expert information on careers in the field. What the book does too well is explain this information. It gives every base definition, theory , and policy in the field. Simply said, the text could be broken down into another textbook and class at the least. The information is also out of date for class usage. Most of the jargon is used common place or definitions are different or not used at all. When it was written, it was a fairly excellent, but in this computer age became outdated in a year. That is something no one could avoid."
2,Not easy reading.,"Introduction to Information Systems: An internetworked Enterprise Perspective is not a book I would recommend. The textbook was not the easiest book to read, although it did help on sleepless nights! There was a good use of color and graphics in the textbook but they didn't help clarify the topics as well as I thought they should. The graphics and tables should be another way of presenting the material covered, but they just seemed to add more confusion. The review quiz at the end of the chapters was helpful in regards to the terms. The application excercises should be left for a computer application class. I think most of the people that are reading this book for class purposes already know the basics to most applications used on computers. Overall, I would recommend using another textbook for this type of course."
3,I found this book to be well illustrated and informative.,"Introduction to Information Systems is the book that we are using in my 300 level Business Class in college. I found this book to be well illustrated and informative. It has some information that I have covered in earlier computer classes, but with a litter more in depth knowledge. I have found that the Summary at the end of each Chapter covers the main points, but leaves out some important information. I have found the Review Quiz at the end of each Chapter to be most helpful study tool. The book is well illustrated and contains alot of business examples. I think this is a good book for upper level information systems classes."
3,Sometimes hard to follow,"For my Business Information Systems class, the required textbook was Introduction to Information Systems by James O'Brien. When I was evaluating this textbook, I considered several different aspects. First of all, I looked at whether or not it was very easy to read and understand. The reading was not too difficult, but sometimes it could be confusing. I found myself re-reading a passage several times trying to make sense of it. With regard to the figures, illustrations, and tables my opinon is not very high. I found the charts and tables to be somewhat confusing at times. When I look at the illustrations I expect to be able to understand the material better. But instead, I found myself having difficulty figuring them out. Overall, I did not like this textbook as much as other books I have used in the past. It wasn't a horrible failure, but I think there could be some definite improvements made in the next edition."
2,A boring book,"As a student trying to come to grips with what Informations Systems are I found this book very hard to get into. The author seems to constantly make a series of statements(which go on for ever) rather than discuss the basic concepts involved.It is grossly over schematic, and the reader could be forgiven for thinking that O'Brian could write ten chapters on how the corner store should be run !"
4,more info,this book gave me a good insight into the construction of the online databases I would with in my appraisal research and taught me what to expect while working with them. the text was a great help.
3,Good general overview,"I purchased this book for a college Information Systems class. It is a good general overview of IS. The negatives are: 1) it is quite repetitive, especially the beginning, 2) the case studies are general -- not in-depth. Although with the right professor and class, it will offer solid support for a mangerial overview of IS."
3,Continually Changing,I use this book for my Business Information Systems class and though I feel that the book has a lot of information I really feel that alot of what is in it is unnecessary. The useful parts of the book is that most of the important information is complete with a diagram to help you to better understand. The nonuseful parts is when it uses terms over and over that you are not familiar with or unless you are a computer major would confuse everyone else. Over all the illustrations and graphics do what they try to explain. I particularily liked Chapter 7 because you see how business information is shared among businesses and employees. Overall this book is well done but needs to be more simplified for those without computer knowledge.
2,Book Review,"I didn't really care for this text book to be honest. It seemed to me that they were just trying to come up with definitions to make the book longer, when all they were doing is repeating themselves over and over again. For instance, on page 280 it talks about videoconferencing. It gives the definition and that's all good, but then it has to go into desktop conferencing and teleconferencing, which they're all basically the same thing, but yet they all have to have they're own definitions and then again repeated in the chart on page 291. Yes, the book was informative and someone could learn from this book. The seemingly needless repetition, and all the little definitions about every little process was a little frustrating to me."
4,-Business Info Systems,"After almost completing the subject of Business Infomation Systems, I found that I have learned quite a bit that I was not real familiar with. The Introduction to Information Systems by James O'Brien was a great part of giving me a good understanding. Some of the most useful features were the diagram and charts that summed up the information at hand. The only disadvantage of the book was that it was out of date. However, that is totally understandable because of the rapid growth in technology. Now after studing this subject I can relate to people when they are using the computer jargon. I may not know exactly what they are talking about by I will have a good ball-park idea.Tonya Penrod Business Information Systems Dr. John Schafer"
2,"For an introductory book, it is okay, but repetitive","The book is very colorful and uses many graphs and tables to support the information. But, the authors are very repetetive and the organization of material is not logical. Topics seem not to be related, and it is wordy."
3,An average book that is overpriced.,The book covers the topics of information systems. It is way overpriced.
3,Serves it's purpose,"I have only been using this book for a few weeks and have found it to be informative. The chapters are long, but they are not hard to get through. It is set up well with key terms at the end of the chapter and their page numbers. The only problem I have is that the case studies seem to ask for answers to questions that is out of realm of this class. I manage to get through them without too much trouble, so I guess it's not the worst thing in the book. Overall, as a textbook for an online class, it serves its purpose. I do like the use of color as it helps separate the various parts of the book from the main text."
4,A Big Little Book,"The person from Durham clearly missed the point of this book. Certainly, Dr. Seuss did not set out to write specifically about ""Equality and Justice, ""Diversity,"" or ""Activism,"" but he didn't have to! (Mmm...but upon deeper thought, I think he *did* set out to write about these very issues!)This is a great little compilation, and doesn't feel forced or faked or ""context-less"" at all. If you are upset and if you find this particular book to be simply a marketing ploy, then you're not heeding the Good Doctor: ""So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact, and remember that Life's A Great Balancing Act.""Certainly, I'll buy books by Dr. Seuss. But I'll buy this one, too, several times."
2,"This ""Book"" is about 50 cents worth of Dr. Seuss...","This is not a critique of Dr. Seuss, nor a bash of his works... BUT... REALLY... It's almost like the few pages of this tiny book get lost between the covers. You can read and digest what little has been printed in this book in less than 2 minutes(even if you're not the fastest reader!). Considering the wealth of writings of Dr. Seuss, please don't waste your time with this pitiful excuse for a publication. Just buy the books... you'll get a LOT more bang for your buck!"
1,Seuss-Isms (Life Favors),This is a tiny tiny book in both size and number of pages. It contains nothing new.........just phrases from other Seuss Stories. I bought it for a gift but was embarrased by the content and size. I bought something else. No reason I can see for anyone buying this book. Don''t waste your money.
2,Not What I Expected,"I was expecting a regular book-size with new material. This was a small, almost pocket-size book that had brief excerpts from his other works. It might be perfect for some people. Just wasn't what I was looking for."
3,"It's ok, but tiny.","I just got this for my mom's birthday, and I know she'll love it. It's very deep and philosophical for being a bunch of quotes from kids' books. But it's about 20 pages, and 3x4 inches. It's tiny and not worth $8 unless you're getting the person something else Seuss-y."
2,"Be Forewarned, this is a VERY small book.","When I read the reviews on this book I interpreted reviewers stating the book was ""small"" to mean the book wasn't very long. While that is true (it's only 32 pages), it's also a physically small book (4.5 x 0.3 x 5.8 inches). Additionally, I was a bit disappointed with the content. All of the advice is just snippets from some of the good doctor's more famous books. The best advice comes almost exclusively from ""Oh, The Places You'll Go!"" while the rest is just hardly what I would really consider to be a ""prescription for living"" (Example: The book's advice for respecting your elders is ""Don't Hop on Pop""). Based on previous reviews I was hoping to be a bit more inspired by the book. It's cute, but not really anything special."
4,Humorous and Insightful,"Many generations of American children have grown up with inimitable stories by Dr. Seuss. The quirky illustrations, off-ball stories, and amusing verse have all contributed to keeping these books among the most beloved children's classics. ""Suss-isms"" is an abridge digest of some of the most memorable and insightful quotes from various books by Dr. Seuss. They are witty, charming and carry surprisingly deep and important messages. The book is incredibly thin, though, and one wishes that more of Seuss wisdom had been included. Nonetheless, this is a very nice little book that could make a fun little gift."
3,"Cute, and typically witty. But incredibly short and somewhat pointless.","This makes a cute stocking stuffer, but do not expect this to bring anything new to the party. It seems to have been produced primarily as an excuse to use the name to sell another product."
2,Disappointed,"Dr. Seuss is one of my favorite authors and I love his quotes. This book was disappointing because many of my favorite quotes weren't even in the book which was very brief. When ordering online, you don't realize that this is actually a mini-sized book that will fit in your pocket."
4,voice,we like him but his voice is a bit creepy.l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l lllllll l l l l l l l
2,Poorly formatted for Kindle,"I am not talking about the content, but the book has been poorly formatted. Half the illustrations are missing and the presentation is messy."
2,Expecting!,"For the Baby's Sake...Zito and Roxane Riccioni were still married when they accidentally conceived their baby. But they hadn't lived together for over a year! Roxane's unexpected announcement left Zito in no doubt - the marriage was definitely back on.Roxane knew Zito would want their baby to have two parents. Still, she didn't expect him to move in right away! But they did have less than nine months to sort out the past. Including why Roxane had run away from her husband in the first place.Reivew: The first 2/3rds of this book took place over a very short period of time and the entire rest of the ""pregnancy"" took only the rest of the book. The story felt rushed and the problems seemed created entirely by the heroine, who was unpleasant to the hero."
3,...,"Both times I tried to order this I was sent a different item, at least they sent me gifts to apologize with it."
4,Pretty Cool,"The altimeter isn't exact, dependent upon air pressure, but you can set by going with known elavations and in time you learn the variance. The barometer is pretty accurate, stil haven't figured out temp...your wrist will throw it off, but should be able to nail down to a close proximity to actual temp. Great watch, many usefull functions such and night light auto engages when watch moved in right direction."
2,"Several myths included as ""fact"" in this book","Be careful - though this is an entertaining read, several historical anecdotes in this book are based on folklore rather than actual documented facts. I would recommend ""A Way Through the Wilderness"" by William C. Davis for a factually accurate history of the Trace instead of this book, which at times reads like a dime novel."
4,Best book on the Trace,"The best book on the Natchez Trace, where Meriwether Lewis died, is The Devil's Backbone by Jonathan Daniels (1962). Very evocative details and a good map too. It's difficult to imagine traveling under such difficult circumstances as faced by people in early America. The Trace was considered an improved road; tree stumps in the road were required to be cut off shorter than 16 inches. As well as being rough traveling, the Old Trace was a dark, heavily forested, and creepy place. Some years later, Audubon made special note of the vultures that flew low to the ground in this area, looking for food. There were human vultures as well.One entire chapter of The Devil's Backbone is devoted to Lewis's death."
1,Economy means broken on arrival,"I picked up two of these because they were inexpensive. I understand that you get what you pay for, but that shouldn't mean that the plastic should be delaminating/coming apart right out of the box. To make things worse, the sticker will not peel of cleanly, leaving a sticky residue that I hate. If there was any sense of quality control, these binders would not have been released. If I could give it no stars I would."
2,Book is noble effort but too surface,This book is a noble effort but will leave the reader somewhat disappointed. The author should have reduced the scope of the book and provided more information on fewer topics. The result is a superficial 'all in one' book that is not satisfying for the natural history keener.
5,"""The God Father of Queensbridge""","No one can deny MC Shan's props and place in Hip-Hop history. The Puma wearing, kangol rocking Shan put Queensbridge on the Hip-Hop map PERMANENTLY! And there is no way on earth you can sleep on his flow! It might sound some what dated today, but 20 years ago, you could'nt name one MC that could top it! Shan went to war single handedly against BDP. A trait of a true MC and warrior! Name one MC that would do that today? I didn't think so! along side the Juice Crew, Shan put out classic hits. And opened the door and inspired countless MC's from QB. I'm from the Bronx, but MC Shan is the man! All his stuff is classic!! ""Nuff respect!"
5,Best Tire Sealer EVER!,"Really ticked-off I had not heard of SLIME years ago! Two friends and myself ride ATV's in very remote mountain areas of Honduras exploring on the weekends and one of the biggest worry we had was flat tires,..... and we did experience several of them that caused some real problems. After hearing about SLIME, I ordered it and installed in all our tires. Since we have not experienced a single problem related to slack or flat tires.Bicycle use here is great and bike tires always give problems. I have put SLIME in many neighborhood peoples bike tires and not a single one has experienced any tire inflation problems since.Our ATV and Bike slack/flat tire problems have all been 100% solved. Probably next to being a miracle product for this use as one can find. It should come as ""Standard Equipment"" from the factory/dealer on every ATV sold."
3,Barbie Fashion Show Game,"This is a really cool game. It does get sorta old though. I love making different fashions every time. But every time you play it's the same fashions you have to choose from. It's ok for right now, I'm 11 and I still like it a little bit."
4,Fun but.....................,"Well, I think this game was okay. I have always been interested in fashion, so I bought this game. I like all the diffrent themes you have (expespecially the wedding one!) but in the end, you can make whatever you want and I needed constant themes because I don't know what themes to choose from. I only enjoyed it when they told you what to make. I also got very frustrated with picking the models moves. I really didn't care and you had to keep chosing four for each model and you run out of poses. I liked it but it got a little boring after a while. By the way, I was like 11 when I got this and now I am 13.............."
5,All you need to know,Excellent book. Breaks down pitching at a level even a 10 year old can understand. Training plans and workouts are a great routine to follow to prevent permanent injury. Every potential youth baseball pitcher and parent should look through this book
3,The last chapter is the star here,"Seaver gives a training program for an aspiring or experienced pitcher from A to Z.The best parts of this book are the beginning and the end: He describes workouts at the beginning of the book, some of which I have used, but even better is his ""join me"" chapter at the end of the book. In this chapter, he takes the reader with him in a game against the Cards, shows how he pitched, complete with a chart, and shares with us his thought processes during the game. This last chapter was worth a star by itself.However, there is one critical fatal flaw in the book: He did not describe what makes a pitch move (ball rotation and rotational direction).I am a softball pitcher, and these chapters helped me as well."
2,Disappointed,Don't buy it if you own a Nokia 5300. It doesn't have the right cord to fit it.Good idea.
5,Great for emergency,"Great for when power outages last for several days, on vacations,away from electrical source for a long time."
3,Package has only one power adapter,"Contrary to the picture on Amazon web site, the package comes with only one power connector. The connector is for older Nokia phones. Newer Nokia phones (e.g. 6103) uses a smaller power connector and won't fit. Total waste of time to purchase and return. I wrote Amazon about the error, but they haven't fixed their web site. The three stars does not reflect the product quality because I did not use it. Rather it is due to both Energizer and Amazon errors in describing the product. If you go to Energizer web site, you see picture of three power connectors, too."
2,Works flawlessly but very poorly designed,The Good: WorksThe Bad:Very hard to open the battery compartment cover. Had to use to plier to open. Not for the weak. What were they thinking?. Did they not do usability testing?
3,good but not great,"I was expecting this charger to be very good as it is from energizer, but its not keep up to its mark. Drains the batteries when kept inside for a short period"
1,the charging head is incompatible,"this product has a charging cable tip which is NOT for the new Nokia phones (which require the very small head tip), it is incompatible with most of Nokia charging heads. I am really disappointed with Amazon, they did not post enough product description so that shoppers can tell for which kind of cellphones this product can be used for."
5,An extraordinary read...,"... as we are sometimes so fortunateto stumble upon. Handily makes you stop, think,reevaluate self and everything around you.Only criticism: too short.I want more."
3,Angle of faucet and installation issue problematic...,"This Moen S711 Waterhill One-Handle High Arc Kitchen Faucet replaced another Moen model. The faucet angle, especially compared to my previous one, is more shallow. This means water comes out closer to the forward edge of the sink... where you are standing. That is no problem while filling a glass, but until you are trained, it is easier to splash yourself when cleaning dishes.And the hoses to the 1/2 inch water lines are now 3/8 inch, so I had to go out and buy brass adapters (two, one for hot and one for cold). The previous model had 1/2 inch hoses. What's with the change?The construction is the Moen quality I've come to expect, but these two issues, the angle of the faucet and the 3/8 inch hoses, were and are irritants."
4,Pretty!,"Right off the bat, I knew I could trust a Moen. They're known for quality. This product is right on par with the Moen name. It's a chrome three piece unit and includes a high faucet, hand sprayer, and one handled lever.A few things to note:- I would have loved to see some sort of 'magnetic catch' on the hand sprayer.- I would have also loved to see a gripper on the hand sprayer. The chrome is a little slippery and harder to maneuver when you have wet hands.- Aesthetically, this is a very pretty set and looks rather elegant with our sink!- Installation was relatively simple and the instructions were clear.Overall, I love this faucet. It's eye catching and does its job well!"
5,"Lovely, functions well","We are very pleased with this faucet. It installed quickly and easily, and works well. The stream from the faucet has the right amount of force and direction. The neck swivels easily and gives a wide arc range of positions. The sprayer has a great shape. My previous one was plastic and I had to turn my hand around to hold it upright--this one fits in the palm so you just grab it and turn it under (sprayer is upside down in your hand). The water adjust is easy and adjusts nicely. If you want a soap dispenser it is easy enough to buy a chrome one and it will match well with this set. The style is not particularly distinctive but neither is my decor so it looks nice without having to fit into some sort of theme. I'm very pleased and would get a Moen faucet again!"
5,Beautiful faucet!,This Moen waterhill Hi Arc Faucet is beautiful and elegant! The oil rubbed bronze is so gorgeous and gives a very classy look to my kitchen ! And Amazon's price cannot be beat!!
1,Sensitive eyes beware,"Something in this made my eyes itch--I do have very sensitive eyes, so you might not have a problem. I also wasn't overly impressed with the product. Aveda's is better, and is about the same price."
2,itchy eyes,"About the only thing I liked about this mascara was the brush. This mascara made my eyes itch like crazy. I couldn't stand it, even blinking would irritate my eyes enough to cause an itch frenzy. I have never had a problem with sensitive eyes and I have used many mascara's. If you are looking for something natural, try Korres mascara. It's a great natural mascara. I even think it's less money than this one. You can find the Korres brand at Sephora (and no I don't work for Sephora). I got this mascara at whole foods, I will be returning it."
4,Much More Than I Expected,"The reason I got this book was illustrated in the first sentence. All of us have been called upon, on a moment's notice, to speak on a topic without preparation. I got much more than I expected. This book is one of those that will have to be read 2 times or more to fully digest the important topics. Expect to be challenged and maybe a little overwhelmed as the author delves deeply into what is going on in our ""background thoughts"". While there are a lot of abstract points, Wydro comes through with some very practical applications as he discusses the Slight Edge Technique, P.R.E.P., the Creative Process Technique, and an intriguing open-ended question exercise. I took lots of notes and found his stories and illustrations to be extremely helpful."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought that this book would give me significant guidance for impromptu speaking, but it didn't. I have to be honest and state that I haven't read the entire book. I got about half way through. It talked a great deal about breathing exercises which I found irrelevant. The only thing that I liked about the book was that it gave you the PREP formula to apply to your impromptu speaking. I will use this approach when giving impromptu speeches, but I expected more strategies to utilize from the book."
2,"this is not a book, it's a redundant pamphlet","This book was required for an upper-division speech class.The class was irrelevant and redundant, and so was this book!There is really nothing new to be found in this book, and there must be better books out there on public speaking (I hope?)waste of money"
2,Orchestration seems to overwhelm the vocals,"After listening to previews from this CD, I picked it up because I especially enjoy simple hymns of the kind selected for this list. But it surprised me to hear how ""done up"" the arrangements were: too many instruments, at times, and often too much harmonic or rhythmic complexity backing very basic melodies. Frankly, some of the arrangements seemed to mimic some of the worst aspects of canned Celtic and new age music. This is a promising program and I would not discount Card's ability to sing it well. But his voice is simply lost amid the various instruments strutting their stuff."
5,Inspirational from begining to end.,"It is rare when any artist can produce an album that has me hitting the replay button over and over. I find I can't get enough of this album, especially when I need to be closer to God."
5,Too bad there's only 5 stars!,"I grew up listening to Michael Card's music. I particularly loved this album because it joined two things that I love dearly.Hymns and Celtic music.Michael's talent is certainly amazing.He began performing when he was still in college.He plays nine instruments and is an amature astronomer.So you can see why ""starkindler"" is not just a desplay of the gifts God's given Him but it is also his tribute to His maker as He gazes at the sky in awe of the Creator of the Universe,the ""Star kindler"" who made the heavens and the earth.I would definately reccomend this to anyone who's seeiking to buy something good and uplifting."
5,Pride in America,"This book touched my heart...the stories, the people. Bob Babcock has truly given this reader the opportunity to share not just the lives of brave soldiers, but the their faith, family and courage. I am a proud homeschool Mom for a Sr & Jr this year...my girls will reap much history and respect for our military men and women through reading this book. I recommend this book to all...ages Jr. High through platinum years. I am ordering copies of this book to place in my local libraries in order to enable others to share these enriching stories. Thank you and God Bless you Mr. Babcock!"
5,History as it was being made,"I seldom will read a book of this size, but once I started I couldn't stop reading. A truly outstanding compilation of articles, short and long, from the soldiers who were there. As you read the stories, you'll begin to get common threads and almost feel as if you knew those writing the stories. This should be in all libraries, especially high/middle schools. A superb publication. We need more like this which preclude fabrication by the authors. Awb Norris Colonel (R) US Army"
3,Apache Rose,"This was a typical Roy Rogers, Dale Evans video starting out with them fighting and then joining up to catch the bad guys. The only thing is, the cover for the video has Gabby Hayes and an Indian on the front with Apache Rose written in an Indian- like font, but the Apache Rose is actually a boat and there are no Indians in it at all."
3,Average Movie But It Is Not In Color!,"There are several Roy Rogers movies that are listed as color when they are not. This is one of those. They are made by Alpha Omega Publications and dated Oct.19th, 2004. This movie is in B&W and not in color. The film quality of this movie in general is not very good regardless of who makes it. The orginal film must not be in very good condition."
3,Pretty Good,"the Vocalist Jacqui Naylor reminds me of Jewel Meets natlie Merchent trying to sound like Rickey Lee Jones. it's that Coffee House vibe.not far from Norah Jones territory if you will. the Band is what moves me the most.i was tripping off the arrangement for ""my funny Valentine"" with the Drummer running the groove of AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" but in a Smooth way.the Band&the Arrangements were truly on point more than anything else."
2,TO COOL TO BE COOL,"I HAVE HER PREVIOUS RECORDINGS AND ADMIRE HER FOR BEING AN ARTIST RECORDING ON HER OWN LABEL. THIS RELEASE HOWEVER IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.THERE ARE FAR TWO MANY OF THE NEW CROP OF SO CALLED JAZZ SINGERS TRYING TO MIX IT UP TO MUCH TO INCLUDE COUNTRY/FOLK, JAZZ AND POP WITH AN ACOUSTIC BAND..ITS ALL STARTING TO SOUND THE SAME. DO WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER NORAH JONES/DIANA KRALL/CASSANDRA WILSON ETC..ONE SINGER THAT DOES MANAGE TO CARRY IT OFF IS CARMEN LUNDY A TRULY AWSOME VOCALIST AND SONGWRITER CARMEN IS CAPABLE OF MIXING AND BLENDING SONGS TO AMAZING EFFECT.THIS ONE IS A DISSAPOINTING PURCHASE FOR ME"
3,Needs a re-master,"I watched this movie on the Western channel a few weeks ago which prompted this purchase. A good movie starring one of my all-time favorites Audie Murphy. Now on to the DVD - The video needs to be remastered. It looks like a VHS copy put on a disc. This movie is good enough for some studio to remaster it. I wasn't happy with the video transfer but it's not a total loss. It is decent enough to watch. I would recommend that if you wan't to buy this to not pay a high price for it. I will keep this DVD because i'm a fan of Murphy and Calvary versus Indian movies. Being that this is an older release it may be the only copy that I ever get of this film, that would be a shame. Unless somebody picks this up to remaster, somebody needs to step up."
3,"loved it as a kid , not so much as an adult",i loved this movie as a kid and broke many toy guns acting out the last 20 mins.well it's not as good as i remember it to be but this tale of the army looking to keep the title guns away from the indians is liked by my boys and we watch it together and that makes this one worth checking out.
1,not enough info,"this charger does not fit the visor edge. the connecting part of the charger that fits into the palm pilot was too small for my visor edge, only info about product was it ""travel charger fits visor series."" Shipping came in decent time and it was packaged well, but I still can't use the charger."
1,Very Thin paper,"This is on very thin paper, and must be mounted or taped to something more sturdy in order to not curl forward. I won't buy these again. My range has a single clip in the middle of the bar to hold these targets up. Luckily, I had sturdy paper to attach these to."
2,Not one of his best,This was an early work before CTI. I think the work from the mid 70s was best. Check out Spanish Blue - RC's best effort by far!
5,Work perfect,"Used them to tie down a tarp over our outdoor dog kennel. We live right on the coast, and they've held up under almost hurricane force winds."
1,Huh?,"Title: Sure Fire 23007UV/C 14"" Heavy Duty Black Cable Ties. 100 per bagProduct Features: Contains 1000 per packProduct Description: Color is black and package quantity is 100."
1,its a video,"I suppose it would be ok if I had a video player, I didnt notice it was a video. I ordered a DVD also and that was better, but I think I need something more updated, hard core."
1,Unseen?,"OMG!! I think this book was very immature, boring and overal a crap book. All the stories were very childish!!!!!!!!!!"
1,BORING AND UPSETTING,"I am sorry but I felt no simpathy for both heros ! HIM: his disappearance for 4 years is unacceptable if only based on his fear of love (not really realistic ). They didn't have a good conversation about that. HER : I think she is very very weak, not at all in phase with what she accomplished for 4 years (running the estate by herself). She was too influencable for my liking. She didn't back up her husband when he needed it."
4,Dom is almost the perfect gentleman,"This book was quite the page turner, and the story line was well written with a lot of mystery that kept you going until the end. However, being the romantic person that I am, I held a lot of hostility towards Dom as he decided to leave Anne on the night of their wedding and abandon her for four years. Their love throughout the story grows and the passion between them sparks and rises to put the romance back into the story. Overall it had a lot of romantic quality but, I would not say that it is among one of Brenda Joyce's best."
1,"Good, but....",I wouldn't recommend it. Story was slow to build up to the climax. The characters were tame and not believable.
4,Beyond Scandal.,Great fan of Brenda Joyce and this book did not let me down. Read this book in 2 days and that was with a house full of kids (9 kids to be exact.)
1,Boring and Fake,"I am a Brenda Joyce fan. But this is her one failure. I thought it was horrible and boring. Has anyone seen ""Random Hearts"" with Harrison Ford? Yeah, that's how this was. The story line was ok I guess, but the characters and the dialogue were all just so cliche and stupid. I hated it."
4,Sizzling!,There's just something about this book that is just so captivating. The plot is good; I like the little twist at the ending. Bit of a surprise but hat is laways good in a book. The sexual tension betwenn Dom and Anne is just so hot!
3,An ok read,"I'd agree with the reviewers who said this book was a page-turner -- at least in the first half. The second half, though, fell apart. (It didn't seem as well edited.) A number of less-interesting scenes detracted from the plot. No spark, other than lusty sex, developed between the two characters, and I didn't feel that estrangement issue was resolved. So, why was Dom away for 4 years, and what are they going to do about it? What about the mistress and the other two children? Three stars because it had potential to be a really good book."
2,The plot line didn't involve love,"It might just be me, but when I read a romance novel I want to be reaffirmed of my belief in love. Being told that the characters fell in love, without seeing any reason why, does not work. The hero was awful. Why did the heroine fall in love with him? And while there were reasons for him to fall in love with the heroine, it never seems as if the hero did. He just suddenly starts proclaiming love. Skip this, and move onto novels that make you, and the characters fall in love."
3,"Murder, Adventure,Romance, 1856 England -- Enjoy !",Beyond Scandal is great historical romantic adventure. This is story about young women Anne Stewart who has always loved Dominick Saint George but he is preparing to marry her cousin. I won't give to much away but someone tries to kill Anne and there is a lot suspects. If you enjoy romance based around the historical genre than you will enjoy this book. I would also recommended `A Loving Scoundrel' by Johanna Lindsey and `All about love' by Stephanie Laurens.
1,ADULTERY - NOT A HERO,"What is it with these writers that think it is romantic for the Husband to leave the wife and go and sleep with everyone he can and then come back to his wife and his explanation is that he was frightened to love, WTF, he also has 2 children with one of his mistresses he had for 5 years. Yes that's right he could sleep with and have children by an exmistress but he couldn't give his wife the same time, AH. Please do not read. Too much angst to bother. Find a proper romance with a great Hero worthy of the name."
2,likeable but not a great romance,"without going over the plot again, i found it not believable that the hero would leave our heroine on his wedding night when he couldn't keep his hands off her in the first place when he wasn't married to her. yes, i know, he had a fear of commitment, but to leave without a word to thewoman he disgraced and had to marry? sorry, not buying it. i also couldn't buy how he came home 4 years later for a totally unrelated reason and immediately decided he couldn't live without her. why would she take him back? she was portrayed as maturing during the time he was gone but she almost immediately reverts to where she was before he left.an okay read at best."
4,"The ""Plots"" Thicken","Author Bill Pronzini, in addition to being one of the most prolific of present day novelists, has also produced a vast quantity of short stories in the western, horror and mystery genres. Published in 1985, ""Graveyard Plots"" is a selection of 23 stories chosen (as the author states in his premise) from the over 150! works of short crime fiction he had produced up until then. The best of these include ""Cain's Mark,"" ""Strangers in the Fog,"" ""Rebound"" and ""Smuggler's Island."" There are also three ""Nameless"" Detective shorts, the best of which is the clever ""Skeleton Rattle Your Mouldy Leg.""Many of the stories are quite short (as few as five pages), and the book clocks in at a mere 255 pages of text. Nevertheless, it is a very good collection by an author who personifies the term ""professional writer."""
2,All Bark and No Bite,"After reading such good reviews I was very disappointed with this book. It is a large, pretty, new age-y, coffee table style book, and I guess that's it's main function. The prose is unenlightened (not to say down right boring), the pictures are too few and far between and not very helpful or explanatory. Unless the whole book is supposed to be a koan (unanswerable zen meditation riddle), you might as well skip this one. The publisher was ready, but alas, no one else was apparently."
3,Some useful tidbits,"This book certainly has some very useful tidbits if you are into Demon the Fallen, but I personaly think these are things which could have really easily have been fit into the base book or player's guide. Considering this book'small size it should be less expensive. Unlike the player's guide or base book it isn't a necessity if your going to play/st demon, but it is helpful."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST,"I have been using Dr. Sears Eico/RX for over a year. It has helped so much with inflamation caused from arthritis and lupus. While I credit part of it's effectiveness to the purity of the product the difference seems to be in the GLA concentrate, toasted sesame concentrate. This balances the fish and does more for inflamation than other brands I have used. When I have tried using other brands part of the old aches return. I love this product because it makes me feel so much better."
1,cashing in on brubeck,"this was the worst compilation of brubeck's music I have ever heard. i played it once and vowed never to listen to it again. there was a sameness about every track and once any musical theme had ever been identified it was generally lost and thrown away, resulting in a dull sameness about every track. your ad did not make it clear that these were to be recordings of live performances and the audience took over at times. i gave it to a friend and he hasn't thanked me yet!"
1,insufferable,"..i just watched this movie on showtime the other day and cannot believe how bad this film really is...it is full of misinformation and down right lies, the Laughlins should be ashamed of themselves...the only question is how can i get back 3 hrs. of my life that i just wasted watching this insufferable bore of a film..."
1,Verdict is in on The Trial of Billy Jack - Don't Ask!!!,"As Billy Jack was good, the Trial of Billy Jack was bad. It was a disgrace to the martial arts, a disgrace to the memory of Billy Jack, a disgrace to anyone involved in its production, a disgrace period.And those are its better parts!!!!"
2,Some interesting info....,"These were very good, inspiring movies...in 1971 I got my black belt in Isshinryu at age 17....I'm still practicing Isshinryu, native american medicine, Tae Kwon Do, and Kyokushinkai...and Falun Dafa...35 years later...By the way...the ""Billy Jack"" series was inspired by the life of Harley ""Swiftdeer"" Reagan...who is still living and in charge of the Deer Tribe in Phoenix, Az...In the second movie in the cave scene is Tom ""Two Bears"" Wilson, who taught Swiftdeer...Tom Wilson was Don Genaro in the Carlos Castenada books....thought I'd let everyone in on this...."
5,Wonderfully Magical,"This is a lovely story, full of color and love and magic. The story of a magical kingdom with a beautiful princess, so lovely you can hardly bear to look at her and a magician's apprentice who wants to love her, but her father; the king, doesn't believe that the apprentice to a second-rate magician is deserving of the hand of the princess. The boy sets out to win the king's approval as well as find love for his friend, a graceful and lonely elephant who lives in an enchanted forest. This is a story like no other. The words are so descriptive and colorful. I used to love when my mother read this to me as a little girl, and now I read it to my little girls. When you read it aloud, the whole room hushes and eyes close to imagine the beauty that these words inspire. My daughter says it is her very favorite story ever. It is definitely one of mine."
2,Why aren't there more female-oriented games?,"Why aren't there more female-oriented games? The answer is simple: ""scratch your own itch"".You see, one of the essential pieces of advice for enjoying programming is to write a program that *you* would want to use. This applies to games just as much as serious applications. Now we all know that the vast majority of programmers are male. So, being male, of course they write games that *males* would like to play.Thus, if you want more female-oriented games, get more females into programming. Duh!"
4,Great workout or chill pants.,Worked great when working out. I did squats going below parallel and they did not rip. I have bought more than one.
5,Nice,"this came sooner than expected and the sweat pants were nice for my dad's x-mas present, he liked them a lot"
2,BALLOON LADY,"Although well made , the legs are like balloons. I'm small & legs are thin ,so yes, I'm unhappy with the ft"
3,"Decent sweatpants, light material","I ended up returning these sweatpants. Nothing wrong with them, a good basic sweat pant at a good price, but the material was a little lighter than what I was looking for since I mostly work out outside. However, next time I need to get something for indoor workouts I'd consider ordering these."
4,NO POCKETS !!,"The sweatpants are a great fit.theoduct looks and feels great. The only provblem is where is one supposed to put onewallet, keys cellphone, loose change, receipts? There are no pockets. Enough said."
3,Decent for the Price,"My boyfriend wanted a pair of gym sweatpants, and my search criterion was: black, drawstring pants, elastic ankles, and pockets. These did not have pockets, but were inexpensive compared to other brands I found. Comfortable, but very baggy. Quality of the materials was not quite what I had hoped for, but hey, I didn't spend much on these."
5,fit well,These are nice sweatpants and wash well. They are very comfortable and slimming. Black color is true to word. Excellent purchase.
1,Poorly made and without pockets,"I would like to say something good about these sweats but can not think of a single thing other than Amazon got them to me quickly.The material is super thin and cheap, the seams are not well done, they are a size too small (I have ordered XL for the past 10 years and wear older ones that size to this day, these are Large at best) and the biggest thing is they do not have pockets."
2,gildan sweatpant,it good in the picture but when you get the stuff it different the materail is too thin i would not recommend to any one
5,Great item and service,"This brand is high quality material (previous owner of same item) so I was dissapointed when a flaw in item meant that I had to return it to vendor. However; the quick, courteous, and personal attention to my return was unbelieveable especially since I am a spoiled Amazon Prime Member and wasn't sure if Lead as a 3rd party vendor would be as hassle free as Amazon concerning returns. I was pleasantly surprised and will continue to purchase from them."
2,What are you looking for in a sweatpant?,"Do you want to get about two weeks of nice, solid wear in before a huge hole rips in the crotch? IN that case, friends, order away!Do you want a nice tight elastic ankle, paired with a low crotch and a high waste, for that timeless Retired Citizens Don't Give A Hoot look? Or that Grandma's Comfy Pants look? Order now!Do you want a pant that you can grow into, and then grow some more? Something comfy that will allow you to really ease into a Thanksgiving eating binge? Nice choice you made looking here.Did you want pockets? Sorry, move on. Did you want a sleek transition-from-pajamas-to-public pant? Sorry, we don't want your kind here."
2,Poorly designed,This pant is basically comfortable but very inconvenient in that it does not provide any pocket. It is obviously cut corner product. I regret that I bought four of this and some are ready to go to recycle to local charities.
1,Chest size?,"Haven't actually bought pants from here, I don't understand why so many places that sell sweat pants list ""chest size"" instead of ""waist size"". I don't pull my pants up to my chest. Chest and waist measurements are different for most people."
2,unacceptably poor quality,"I agree with other reviewers that the quality of this phone in terms of being able to hear and be heard is poor enough to warrant returning it. To best describe the quality, I would say it's like talking on a speakerphone even when speaking directly into the handset. There are odd fluctuations in the volume levels of what you can hear, there is static whenever you speak, there is eerily dead silence when the conversation pauses and there is a very faint echo of everything you say. People on the other end of the call also complain about the quality. Using a headset did nothing to improve the situation. This is all too bad because the design of separating the base from the handset is perfect for me. And the fact that using the phone doesn't disconnect my wireless internet connection as my 2.4GHz phone did is great. But I guess I am willing to put up with that to return to the excellent sound quality of my 2.4GHz Uniden telphone."
4,"Decent phone, but gives interference to an FM receiver","I bought the phone about 10 days ago and quite like it. One minus is that it gives some nasty interference to my FM receiver: strong click every second.Another minus was already mentioned: that it doesn't synchronize Called ID display with the phonebook name.My previous 900 MHz Called ID phone allowed to enter its area code, to strip the area code indication and to avoid dialing it back with the areacode (to avoid local toll charges?). This phone doesn't allow it.Speakerphone and earpiece sound quality is very good. Another pluses: charger for the spare battery on the base (the battery is also used as a backup in the power outage), allows to transfer the call to another handset, intercom to any handset (handy for the townhome), message waiting indicator."
1,Stick with 2.4GHz,"I bought this VTech phone last week from a local retailer and ended up exchanging it for another a few days later because we couldn't get the handset to recognize the base, even after entering the base ID into the handset over a dozen times and unplugging everything and letting it sit overnight. The 2nd phone found the base perfectly. However, the reception was so poor that I'll be returning that one too. The sound cut in and out and I could barely leave the room where the base was - taking the phone outside wasn't even possible before it dropped the call.I really liked the design and the functionality of this VTech, but 5.8GHz or not, this is one phone to avoid. Our house is brick and we've had reception problems with cordless phones in the past, but we've never had any problems with Panasonic. Go with the Panasonic KX-TG2700S instead. It's only a 2.4GHz, but I'm getting perfect reception with the Panasonic AND can take it outdoors without any problems."
3,"nice features, but disappointed","I bought this phone because it was a 5.8 ghz and thinking it would have a very good range. When I would walk out of my house for about 15' there was no connection. Also, there was constant chopping. I retuned it. I think the higher you go (in technology)the worse it gets. So I bought a 2.4ghz, However I think that I was more satisfied with 900."
2,"Beautiful phone with fancy features, but that's about it!","I was so excited about purchasing this phone with all of it's neat features, but as soon as I plugged it up....instant disappointment. This phone has more static than any I've ever heard. I'm sure it wasn't my line because when I tried a different phone in the line, it was crystal clear. I stil have the phone but the first thing on my to-do list tomorrow is to return it!"
2,Can't communicate with Talk America Caller ID,We bought this phone to replace an old Pansonic cordless. It would not show who was calling on caller ID. Tried talking to VTech customer support but they are located somewhere outside the country and really couldn't help beyond reading from various manuals they must keep on line. Thought maybe it was just this model so ventured off to Best Buy to try a new VTech model. It wouldn't communicate either. Returned both and have settled for a Uniden with base speaker phone. First try it recognized and displayed caller ID info. Be careful if you use Talk America as your provider!
2,It's not really 5.8 GHz,"The cordless phone works, and is clear. But be warned. This is not a true 5.8 GHz phone. The base transmits at 5.8 GHz, but the phones transmit at 2.4GHz. So if you're buying this in order to reduce interference with a wireless network (or from a microwave), look elsewhere. It will not solve your problems."
3,"Great features, echoes if you turn volume higher","I loved this phone when I first bought it from Sams Club. The version I bought included a 2nd handset w/ a color screen. Cool ringers, nice speakerphone capability and answering machine. I was thrilled, until I turned the volume up. I could hear my voice echo every time I spoke. I had to return the phone, because that was unnacceptable for this expensive of a phone. Vtech seems to be aware of the problem. I would only recommend this phone if you have excellent hearing and don't need to turn the volume louder."
3,Great Phone w/ some Caveats,"I love this phone although there are two key features missing. The Caller ID doesn't display the number you have saved in Memory. This is a real pain when people call from their cell phones and it says, VERIZON and the phone number. Where you had the proper name and number stored in memory. Also there is no way to copy the memory between phones, this is a major flaw. My Sony 900 MHz cordless, can do it. The sound is great and the speakerphone is perfect if you need to listen in on a conference call you can just mute the phone and put it down, otherwise the speakerphone is not really usable."
2,Don't buy this phone if you have a wireless network,"As some have mentioned in this review section., this is not a true 5.8 phone. I have a G-wireless network set up and use vonage as phone service. The calls I make from this always break up and I thought it was Vonage. I used a corded phone and the sound quality of my call was impeccable. I bought this phone because I thought it was true 5.8 and wouldn't interfere with wireless, boy was I wrong.DON'T BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU HAVE A WIRELESS NETWORK.however, the speakerphone on the handset and the console are superb, extremely loud. I think this could be a great phone if you don't have a wireless network."
1,Worked great when it would charge,"This phone system worked great for our house -- in conjunction with our wireless network as well -- for a little while. After about 4 months of use, whenever the phones were put onto the charging cradles, they would charge for a few seconds, but then the charging light would go out and the phones stopped charging. When this first started happening, I only had to adjust the position of the phone or clean the connections -- annoying but it worked for a little while. Now, nothing works and we can't get the phones to charge consistently. We're trashing these phones and now looking for new ones."
1,"Terrible Reception, Does not work w/ DSL!?!?","I had been excited about this phone all year after hearing about the new features. I bought the phone at Amazon the first days it was available and waited in anticipation to get the phone set up. Unfortunately it is with great disappointment that I am returning the phone today. I have had several conversations with VTech support due to the TERRIBLE static I was receiving while sitting next to the base, and the fact that the phone would randomly lose connection with the base, while sitting NEXT to the base. I finally had one rep tell me this phone was known to have a problem if you have DSL! Today I am packing the phone up for a return, much to my chagrine!"
3,Confusion on frequency,"I haven't bought it, ignore my rating. However:I notice most people say it doesn't use 2.4, and one personsays it does. I went to the VTech web site and it says:""One of the key elements that sets the VTech 5831 apart from other cordless phones is its unique 5.8 GHz - 2.4 GHz dual-band design. This advanced communications architecture gives the base unit the ability to transmit in the more powerful 5.8 GHz frequency band. In turn, while the handset transmits in the more energy-efficient 2.4 GHz band.""So, it does use 2.4, and for an apparently good reason (battery).I use wireless networking, so I'm concerned about 2.4 inteferring. I may end up getting an old 900mhz before they stop making them!"
2,Do Not Purchase,"I purchased the VTech i5820 phone system along with 4 additional handsets (i5801).. They worked fine in the beginning.. Then one of the batteries failed. A quick call to VTech customer service for a new one. Not the case. I was informed by VTech customer service that these models are no longer made.. and they DO NOT have any batteries or accessories available for them. Trying to find OEM replacement batteries is almost impossible. The usual stores.. Best Buy, Staples, Office Max, Circuit City, Target no longer stock these modes. VTech's solution was for me to ""upgrade"" to another one of their phone systems...Of course.. ""At a BIG discount because I am an existing customer""! I loved the phones in the beginning.... and still do.. but purchasing replacement parts will be impossible."
1,You rather buy a cell phone!,"I was never happy with this phone from the get go. One handset never worked since it couldn't locate the base no matter what you did. The second handset seemed to work great, but the person on the other side kept on complaining the voice was breaking up. Most of the people felt that I was calling them from a cell phone. My wife refused to use the phone (even with its great looks!) so I had to return it and get a 2.4GHz phone. You rather buy a cell phone atleast you get better range then this one."
2,Worst Phone Yet!,"This phone is great for the speaker, but I would not recommend this phone for the hearing impaired. Both my husband and I agree, it's like talking to someone standing in the middle lane of a highway. The back ground noise make it very hard to hear the person on the other end. Everyone sounds like they have a cold. Just by looking at the phone, you can tell it takes up to much room."
1,Don't buy V-Tech,This phone looks great in theory. One base with expansion headsets! In reality the sound quality is poor. The range is minimal. In less than three months I had problems with reception. My friends told me it sounded like I was under water. I now have an AT&T that works great! The gentleman in the phone store told me he gets more returns on VTech than any other brand.
1,Not the best,"This is probably the worst phone I have ever owned. The sound quality is tin-can at best, the rings are all annoying, the buttons are teeny and hard to use."
1,Worst Phone Yet!!!!,"This phone is the worst. It takes up to much room. The sound reception is like talking to someone in the center lane of the expressway. We own another Vtech phone which was a total waste too. The only best part about this phone is it has a speaker phone, but for anything else the phone isn't worth the bucks. For the hearing impaired this is your worst nightmare of a phone."
3,Cordless Phone Range,"This isn't a review of this particular product as much as it is a comment about the range of cordless phones as it relates to the frequency at which they operate.As a general rule the higher the frequency the shorter the operating range. There are factors (like the amount of power) that could affect the range but these are closely controlled by the FCC and other agencys.The higher frequency provides the ability to provide more features but at a loss of signal range. The best illustration of this is the cars on the street that have the sound cranked up. You can hear the low (bass) sounds from a block away because they operate at a low frequency and move through objects very easily. The higher the frequency the more likely it is that it will be deflected or blocked by an object.My 900MHz v-tech phone has a range that allows me to use it over at my neighbors house which is over 150' away, while my new 2.4GHz phone won't even cross the yard between us."
2,Very Disappointing Performance,"I bought this phone expecting that it would be perfect for our needs. My home office is in a barn that's next to our house, not far away, maybe thirty feet. I put the base station in a room in the corner of the house nearest the barn, and the handset in my home office in the barn. Reception was horrible at all times. I have a WiFi network, and wondered if that might be the problem. I returned the phone and bought a Vtech 5825 (available on Amazon via Circuit City), a less well known model that comes with two handsets but is not expandable beyond those two. The 5825 has the same technical specs as this model (same frequencies), but works vastly better when configured in exactly the same way. Reception is crystal clear always, with no interference from the WiFi. The 5825 is also cheaper. If you don't need more than two handsets, go for the 5825."
4,Santa Cruise,I always love to read Mary and Carol Higgins Clark's holiday books. I enjoyed this one but it wasn't my favorite. I do especially love the mysterys with Alvirah in them.
2,Yuck,"This is the second mother daughter duo I have read and it will be my last.This book had very little substance. The characters were very flat and one dimensional Where was mystery to solve? It started with us knowing all about the two criminals on board, and went downhill from there."
2,Not too impressed,"I love Mary Higgins Clark, and was looking forward to a light, holiday read. I was very disappointed in this book.Maybe it was because I have not read any of the Regan Riley books, but I thought there was no depth to the characters, or to the storyline.I would definitely recommend borrowing it at the library and saving your money!"
3,Typical Christmas Story from MHC & CHC,"I feel that the annual Christmas books from MHC and CHC are really more along the line of short stories, that were fleshed out a bit in order to make a ""book"". :)With that said, this was typical of the other Christmas books they have published, and was an okay read."
1,A huge disappointment!,"I'm a huge fan of Mary Higgins Clark (MHC), but have only read one by her daughter prior to the Santa Cruise. I can now officially say it will be my last. I'm certainly HOPING that the problems with the Santa Cruise stem from the collaboration with Carol, and are not truly a reflection on MHC's declining ability to write great mysteries.This book had very little substance. The characters were very flat, one dimensional, and acted like complete idiots throughout the book. I didn't really feel there was any sort of mystery to solve. You went in knowing all about the two criminals on board, and things just didn't get any better from there.I can only hope that my next MHC read, Two Little Girls in Blue, will dispel any doubts I'm currently having towards her writing ability."
1,Seasick,"This book was not well written --- too many ""plots"", no real good story line --- for a Higgins/Clark book, we were sorely disappointed. Made a long trip by car even longer!"
2,DON'T BOTHER...........,"...with this ridiculous piece of holiday fluff. In this tale, lottery winner turned amateur sleuth Alvirah Meehan is invited on a free cruise targeting ""do gooders"" as reward for their community service. The invitation to Meehan--with extra tickets to invite several close friends--is primarily a pulic relations move by the boat's owner...to garner positive publicity and boost future sales. But it all goes wrong when the owner's nephew, intent on a big payday, brings on a couple of criminals hell bent on escaping prosecution...and when that happens, nothing goes as planned for anyone. Not for the cruise, the boat owner, or Alvirah and her friends.With a formulaic and predictable ""plot"" burdened with cliched phrases and names (of course, people are threatened with getting ""whacked"" and mobsters have names like Tony ""Bull's Eye"" Pinto) this one was tough to get through.....Ok, I wasted enough time reading it. No more time for a review. Be warned.DYB"
1,Bad Trip,"Too bad there isn't an agency that could stop ""over the Hill"" writers (such as Mary Higgins Clark) from publising such nonsense as ""Santa Cruise"". Like ""Christmas Thief"" this was apparently written for Children. The book is just plain silly. Wonder why she keeps writing?"
3,"A light, entertaining book for snowy weather.",A book that you had to find out the outcome of but on a pretty light plain.
2,Not up to snuff for either author,This is the worst of the Christmas books by these two authors. The discription of the cruise is totally unauthentic. I generally like to read Christmas themed books over and over each year. Once was enough.
2,A mystery-less mystery,"The only redeeming feature of this novel is that the plot is clever--what if two criminals hid on a cruise ship filled with philanthropists? The writing is dreadful--adverbs abound, the characters are caricatures, and the mistakes ridiculous (example: a character is gagged, then answers a question.) I won't be reading another novel by this author combo (although I doubt MHC contributed anything to this effort other than her famous name)."
1,Santa Cruise,"What a hokey tale - and a disappointment. The situations were implausible - and not funny. Just silly.... was Carol the writer who diluted the fun with all the silliness? Please... ""My mommy lies over the ocean..."" as a funeral song at sea???? Save your money."
1,This book stinks,"Even by adding Mary Higgins Clarks name to this cover, it is boring to the max.Carol will never be the author her mother is, even with her help. I have tried reading a few and gave them to Goodwill. What a waste of paper and print."
1,Santa Cruise,Zero stars. This must have been Carol's first book supported by her mother because it isterrible. I was forced to listen to it on tape on a car trip. I would have rather had silence.Has this author ever even read a good mystery?
2,Disappointed,I didn't think the book was geared for an adult reader. Very juvenile. No real mystery.
3,Okay... Just Okay,"I heard the audiotape of this one and found the characters hard to follow. No one had a personality. I couldn't tell Jack, from Alvira, Regan, and Willy.The plotting was okay. A lot of coincidences but I guess that's to be expected."
1,Disappointing,"I have enjoyed Mary and Carol's collaborations in the past, but I couldn't even make it halfway through this one. I would instead recommend any of their other novels. The Christmas Thief, He Sees You When You're Sleeping, and Deck the Halls are far better. Do yourself a favor and save some time by not reading this book."
3,Typical,"The usual plot for Mary Higgins Clark, always looking for a new angle with familiar authors."
1,Santa Cruise,I was disappointed in Mary and Carol's book. The story was notinteresting as all. Poor story line and writing.
4,Santa Cruise,Do you like bungles and bumps? Then you will like this book. It tickled my funny bone many times.
1,Skip this book!,"Yikes....this is really a stinker. The plot is unrealistic, the charactersare shallow and the writing is bad!! Other than that, it's great. They should both be ashamed to collect a paycheck on this one. P U!! Move along quickly to find another book to read."
1,Absurd!,"I've been a fan of Mary Higgins Clark for decades, and there is no way she could have had anything to do with the writing of this book. Too many characters (many of whom are unlikeable), too many names to remember, phrases like, ""She opened the door with infinite care,"" awkward transitions. Painful reading at best."
1,Did an eighth grade writing class pen this??,"This book was filled with cliches ""He thought craftily..."" - Really? The plot was anemic, and the concept absurd. While reading this book, I kept thinking of it in terms of a vaudeville melodrama, with the ""villian"" and his moustache, the bumbling commodore, and a clever gal friday. PLEASE. We know these authors could do better. Save yourself a couple of hours and pick up a good book that won't leave you shaking your head in disbelief."
2,"Fun, but lacking in intesity and dramatic element","This is a fun read, but nothing very deep about it. I really enjoy the plot buildup in Mary Higgins Clark novels. This just doesn't do it. The bad guy is caught and the book is over before you even get to know the characters."
2,Truly disappointing,I honestly don't know what to say about this book. It just wasn't typical MHC style. Not very thrilling at all. Very disappointed with this one.
2,Just okay,"I am sorry to say that I actually purchased the book and didn't borrow it from the library. Really not very much to the story, the most I can say is that it was a quick read. I've certainly read better by MHC. Do yourself a favor, if you must read this book, borrow it."
2,Not Worth Buying,"I love Mary Higgins Clark and have read almost every book she has written. I was looking forward to reading Santa Cruise but was, unfortunately, very disappointed. I wish I hadn't bought it and just went to the library.The books in which she collaborates with her daughter are not very impressive."
3,Sunday School Musical(2008),"The Asylum has gained a bad reputation for making low budget duplicates of Hollywood movies for the home video market. Sunday School Musical(2008) was harmless fun. It's not perfect. A musical number with Zack starts and then nothing happens! The Christian themes are shoehorned into the movie. The film stars...nobody! I am kidding. It stars Chris Chatman and Candise Lakota. It's directed by Rachel Lee Goldenberg. Amy Ganser is ultra cute as Margaret. In Sunday School Musical, two choirs work together to save a church from being closed. Sunday School Musical tries to cash in on the success of Disney's High School Musical movies. Hollywood produced musicals from the 1920's to the 1960's. The genre was almost dead in the 1970's.Only recently has Hollywood movies and TV shows started a renewed interest in the musical genre with TV shows such as Glee. Sunday School Musical is a fun, B grade musical."
1,Warning about this movie: Good Christian families should not buy or rent!,"Esther LINDSEY ""esther_in_ohio"" was very perceptive, and you should read her review carefully (even if we have different ideas about appropriateness of kissing).The movie is indeed full of spiritual problems. The biggest problem is that the Production Company of this film, ""Faith Films"" is owned and operated by a larger company called ""Asylum"", that makes blockbuster rip-offs and produces and distributes hard-core pornographic films. You can look them up on IMDB, or there is a Wikipedia page talking about them.Do not buy this movie. Your money may go to pay for pornography."
3,Rockbuster review,"""A women gets to choose a husband and I thank god for that choice"". This is said by Fiona Quinlan, Thomas Quinlan's mother. Tom is a coal miner in Castlegate, Utah. He is in a rip between the unionized miners and the wooblies after two detectives murder his uncle {a union man} when he was ten.If you want to read a good historical fiction with teenage issues like love, hate, and obligation to family and work then this is the book for you. I loved this book because of the rapid change of events that cause major conflict. i can also relate to this book considering I am 15 and tommy goes from ten to eighteen in this book.If you are a teenager {boy or girl} and in the mood for a book of action, suspense, question and love pick up Rockbuster by Gloria Skurzynski today."
1,Save your money!,"Save your money. This video taught me nothing about the Ukraine, its countryside, its people, or its culture."
5,My review on the Wrestling Album,This album rules!!!! It is an A plus!!!! It has some of the best WWF songs from the 80's!!!! If you don't like 80's wrestling or the Hulkster than I got 2 words s**k it!!!!!!!!
5,"the best album since ""Leo Sayer Live""","Though I disagree with one Nikolai Volkov's anti-American rhetoric, the suave crooning of Louis Albano along with song stylings of many World Wide Federation Superstars serve to make this record album a bodyslammin' good time!"
5,A Kickin A** Cd,"I totally agree with everyone. This album is well over-due to be re-released. As with others, i really hope that they release Piledriver as well."
4,is it the original,"I notice on the playlist no Volkoff, albano or Piper..is this a typo or did they take the songs off?"
1,This is garbage!!,"Wow, they actually put this ""anti-classic"" on CD. Seriously, this is a very bad album. Practically none of the ""superstars"" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs. Not that they fare too well when they sing ""serious"" songs. Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders ""Cara Mia"" unintelligible. Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money. If you are a fan of bad celebrity singing, you should get this album."
3,This takes me back to the days when i was a baby Hulkamaniac,"This is worth getting for nostalgia reasons.There are a few real themes on here, but the rest of them are just goofy songs sung by the wrestlers ( still, it's better than ""Wrestlemania:the album"" ). This is worth every single cent, though for "" Grab Them Cakes"" and ""Real American"" ( the best theme EVER! ). Now only if they'd rerelease 'Piledriver""...."
4,"Hesitant to spend 12, BUT....","I'm 32 years old as I write this. I remember buying this album brand new back in the day and spinning it (yes, I had it on an actual RECORD!!!) non stop. When the parents would leave, I would crank it LOUD and lip sync to my favs. My big time heroes at the time were Piper (so of course, I loved For Everybody), and Paul Orndorff (who old school fans will remember came to the ring to Real American after he turned on Hogan. Anyhow, the way I see it, anything that can make you smile is a good thing. This is a CD that will make you smile. It might be lost on those who didn't follow the WWF in the late 80's. I just wish it wasn't 12 bucks."
4,Funnier and better than any ring entrance music album,"The first album made by the WWF (WWE)was the best. This album does it's job in entertaining the listener with it's ""recording studio"" angle. The songs are great till this day, I mean ""Mean"" Gene Okerland sang ""Tutti Frutti""! Aside from that song, Roddy Piper, Junkyard Dog, Hillbilly Jim, and the great Nickolai Volkoff contributed. It's fun to hear the WWf when it was goofy and more importantly: Suitable.A great buy to relive some good memories."
2,Pretty bad...,"Before I posted this this album had a 4.4 out of 5, no clue why. I've been a wrestling fan since 1985 but still this is horrible by today's standards and even then too I'd imagine. I might give it closer to 2.5 cause Hulk Hogan's two themes are good especially Real American and I like Don't Go Messin With A Country Boy but everything else is completely horrible, 2/5."
5,Family member gift,My granddaughter requested the DVDs for Christmas. She was so excited to have them and watched the original movie once as 2D & once as 3D. She shared her viewing with her cousin and it made for a great afternoon of fun for them.
1,Not User Friendly; Poor Sound Quality,"This item is EXTREMELY difficult to set and use. It is not intuitive and requires multiple buttons be pushed simultaneously in order to set it. Instruction manual can no longer be found online and item is not longer supported by Timex. Music sound quality is very poor, even radio stations that come in strong on other radios are fuzzy with no option to tweak the settings. Given the price, there are definitely better quality systems available. Not worth the bother."
3,Too Pricey,I would love to buy one of these or one like it but this one is the only one I can find and it is to much money.
1,Not good.,I do not recommend this product...The nature sounds are stiff and unbelievable...The most upsetting thing was that you cannot listen to a CD and then use the buzzer alarm...You must remove the CD from the machine inorder for the buzzer to sound.
1,What a pain,"There should be zero stars rating. First of all the time display is to bright to let anyone sleep. Second, you practically have to read the instruction manual every time you want to change the time, it's that complicated and even then you still wonder if you set everything right. Front has to many buttons, the cd player lid opens by itself, lousy reception. I think it's the only bad product I ever bought from Costco. I finally just junked it and went out and bought a Sony...Don't spend the money, you can do better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I am a very technical person (I teach Photoshop) and this product is either defective, or I should have paid attention to the mediocre evaluations. We still cannot get the CD player to work. You should be able to hit CD, then play, and it should work. Buy a Sony instead. We have one for my son, and it's great. My daughter still has no music in her room."
1,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed in the Timex Clock radio I bought and will probably return it. The main reason I chose this clock was for the built in CD, but the CD sounded terrible! Not because the sound quality was bad but because when the CD is spinning it makes a loud whiring sound - you can only drown it out if you turn the volume up really high. I also didn't like how bright the LCD window was. When it's sitting a foot from your face on the nightstand it can be very annoying. It does have the option to turn the brightness down, but then you can't see the time! I liked the styling and thought it was easy to program but I would not recommend it."
2,Makes me long for a wind up alarm clock.,"This device is too complicated. After you set the alarm, you have to remember that this is not the same as turning the alarm on, so you have to hit another button. You also have to remember that hitting the OFF/RESET button on the top of the clock just turns off the alarm for that day. The alarm will go off the next morning unless you hit another button. This is especially annoying when the alarm goes off at 6 AM on a Saturday. The nature sounds are repetitive and irritating with the possible exception of the ocean. The mechanism of the CD player is noisy, making it difficult to listen to low-level music to sleep by. While the display is backlit, the controls are not, so it's difficult to turn things on and off in the dark. I would not buy another one of these."
3,All functions do not work properly.,"I purchased this CD clock radio just 2 weeks ago and have grown attached to it's look. It looks fancy in a bedroom, so I haven't taken it back. It does not let you program it to wake to nature sounds, and if you just want to play them, I cannot get it off of the ""Ocean"" sound to the other sounds. So I am waking to music, which is fine I guess, but it was alittle spendy just for a CD clock radio that the nature sounds do not work. If it wasn't for the techno-look of the machine, I would have returned it.Addendum to review: I did end up taking it back after I could not play a CD on it or figure out how to wake to anything else but the radio."
2,eh...,"It's not as good as it could be.The Bad:I agree with other posters who say the alarm limit is horrible, and the cd player hisses way too loudly, the hiss will actually wake me up before the music even starts, and it's impossible to lie in bed and relax with the cd player hissing right in my ear. The cd player also has plenty of problems reading ""burned"" cd's (CD-R's)The nature sounds are also really bad, you can hear an audible click or pop every few seconds when the loop ends on every sound.Speakers are horrible, I get better sound out of my older, much smaller tape player/alarm.The good:Large Indigo display, very nice.The ability to set the volume low for the ""sleep"" timer, and still have it be loud when the alarms go off.Having three seperate alarms is a nice feature.Overall, if I had to do it over again, I would definitely choose another system with the same features."
4,New version out,Apparently Timex licences it's clock radios out to another company called SDI Technologies. They have a new version of this alarm clock (as of 03/13/01) with the model number T601G. The biggest noticable change is the lcd color is now amber. Hopefully they address internal issues? You can also hear the Nature Sounds if you go there.
3,Dificult to set,"I received this as a x-mas gift from my electronical engineer husband. Once it gets going, it is just fine, but it is very difficult to set the time to wake up. For awhile we had 3 separate times set. The first CD I used would alternate songs to wake us up. When I put in a new one, it just plays the first song, EVERY morning. Thus you tend to sleep through it."
3,Love / Hate,"I have a love / hate relationship with my clock radio. I have had this model for many years (I'm thinking about 8 - 10 years). I love falling asleep to the nature sounds and love that it reliably wakes me every morning that it is set for. That's the love part. Beyond that, I have to retrain myself every time I need to adjust the time (at least twice a year). There are way too many buttons and the functions are not intuitive. The clock seems to gain about two minutes a month ... that's a good thing up to about the 10 minute mark. And the buttons, while difficult to figure out, somehow are easy for the cleaning woman to either turn off or turn on accidentally while dusting. But bottom line, I came on here to make sure the unit is still available for whenever this thing finally bites the dust ... if ever."
2,Wish I hadn't bought it,"There are WAY too many buttons, and it's way too easy to screw the thing up accidentally and oversleep because you shut off the alarm without realizing it. Plus, the time display is so big and so bright that I had to get used to it when I first bought it because the light made it difficult to fall asleep. I wish I hadn't bought it."
2,Internals are too loud,"Does what it says but the actual running noise ""hum"" is too loud, so loud in fact it will actually compete with soft CDs. I like a bit of Enya to wake me and I heard more of the unit than her mmmmming. Quite the duet.The ocean waves and similar sounds are good however so it's nice for that."
3,"Sounds okay, time display poor","The one function that can be used most--learning the time--is the poorest designed on this product. Ditto for the Philips AJ3940 CD Dual Alarm, which we also bought. The digital displays are NOT at all comparable with those available on much cheaper clock radios."
4,a good buy,"I bought this product for it's nature sounds and cd use is our child's room. It has performed quite well, and I have little complaints. The display is quite bright, and serves as a night lite. It seemed simple to use to me, I didn't even need the instruction manual to set it up. It offers a lot of variety for what it is: an alarm clock. I would not buy it to use as a stereo, because that's not what it's meant for. It's variety makes it worth the price. I've found it's only fault to be that the buttons may be too small for a young child to operate it sufficiently."
2,poorly designed alarm clock,"I bought this alarm because I liked the idea of having so many features to choose from. Unfortunately, I did not notice how poorly designed the clock is until I received it. The snooze button is right beside the off button, so I have already overslept several times when I thought I hit snooze, but actually hit off. The indiglo display lights up my entire bedroom, so I have to pull the covers over my head to get to sleep, and when I wake up in the night and want to know what time it is, I have to put my face directly in front of the clock to see the numbers, as they are invisible from an angle. I do appreciate the options available on this clock, but I would recommend looking around some more if you think any of my complaints would bother you too."
2,Second rate CD mechanism,"I bought two of these (one for myself and the other as a gift). Both have a very serious problem for anyone who hears well. Although the quality of the CD playback seems OK (this is not a stereo component folks), the motor in the player that spins the CD gives off an loud, high pitched and extremely irritating noise. It can even be heard through headphones. Listen too long and you will get a headache.I have checked a few that I have found on retailer's shelves and they all do the same thing. You're better off buying a clock radio and a portable CD player."
1,Terrible product - Poorly thouht out,"This is a poor product, you cannot even use the cd player and buzzer together for waking up. The sound generally and the nature sounds in particualr are poor as well. Don't waste your money."
2,Disappointing,"I recieved this as a gift, which is good because I would not have spent the money on this if I had known that it was difficult to operate and made a wicked hissing noise when CD's were played. I had gotten this radio/alarm clock/cd player for my office so that I could listen to music softly instead of blasting my real CD player louding three rooms away. As far as the radio function, that is pretty basic and simple. However, to play CD's, I continuously forget how this thing operates since it has multiple buttons on front (so many to press!) and once I get out the manual (again) it has a high pitched hissing noise that scares the cat. I rarely use the nature sounds. They are just 6 second bits repeated over and over!"
1,DOES NOT LAST,"have had this item for about one year and kept it in very good condition -- no spills, no dropping -- yet the cd & radio alarms no longer work (cd only works if there is not cd in it). not reliable at all!!"
1,CD Player stopped working,"I agree with StevenJM's review. This product was defective within weeks of the purchase. The CD player just stopped working.Replaced it with the Magnavox which was much better (but had one big drawback, no battery backup). A recent spill has sent me looking for a new one. Probably going with the Sony."
2,Loses Time,"I bought this to be able to play CDs at work -- with a small cubicle space, it fits well enough. Just don't rely on it for time as my unit loses 10 minutes a month! I thought about getting another one for home to wake up by, but within a month, I'd end up being late for work."
1,WAY too complicated,"I recently tossed mine in the trash.I was soooo frustrated trying to set it, play a CD, or even getting the alarm to work. There was nothing intuitive. I did not use it for two years because of the nonsense, so hey, if its that bad, I did not even want to donate it to Goodwill.Maybe you will have better luck being a techie, but as a guy who just wanted to listen to CDs and have a wake up alarm, I now use my phone as the alarm and play CDs in my computer CD player with my Bose speakers for $50 on eBay.Also, for the price, the sound is tinny.I hope there is something better out there for you."
2,too many flaws,"I have owned this alarm clock for a couple of years now, and I regret to say, I am at long last in the market for something better. From day one, the clock would gain time, a couple of minutes per month. The cd player (which whined noisily when it started up) also stopped working long ago, and unfortunately, the cd player was the main selling point for me when I purchased this clock. The radio reception leaves a lot to be desired, depending on where I stand in the bedroom. My final complaint is that some (not all) of the functions are way too complicated to program without the manual, which disappeared a long time ago.Why 2 stars then? The one reason I have kept the clock far beyond its prime is that I love the nature sounds feature. I find now that I have difficulty falling asleep without the serene forest breeze whispering in my ears - I am a ""soothing nature sounds"" junkee. On another positive note, the alarm has been very dependable, aside from user error."
1,Undependable and too hard touse,"After putting up with this Timex radio for way too many months, I'm back searching for a better quality, more user-friendly clock radio. It looks great, but the quality isn't there. Poor reception. Volume control is particularly bad -- hard to find a mid-level sound output. It jumps from too low to too loud, which can be incredibly annoying when you need a dependable alarm. Sometimes the sound was too low to wake me up; other times, the sound would blare out and wake up the whole household.Worst problem is difficulty in setting the station pre-sets. After reading the insructions several times, the radio just proved unresponsive to my station settings. I'm extremely disappointed and would not recommend this radio to anyone."
2,"Sounds great on paper, but doesn't deliver","This clock sounded great. CD player, nature sounds, indiglo etc... But, frankly, it kinda [stinks]. The CD player is WAY too loud. It's ridiculous. You can't listen to a CD without hearing a hissing sound unless you crank it; this player wasn't made to be cranked, though. Also, the Indiglo feature is so bright that it kept me awake at night. I had to turn it down so low that it was illegible. Also, Timex made the numbers so hard to heard that you have to be at the right angle and proximity just to read it. Lastly, the nature sounds sound terribly fake. And....there is no buzzer....I do not recommend this product. Look elsewhere. It is feature-packed, but low quality. The only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty sweet."
5,Buy it!,"Your alarm clock is something you use everyday, so why not buy one that you can enjoy? The nature sounds aren't quite as realistic as I hoped, but I'm a happy customer. Get rid of that alarm clock that sounds like a 5 alarm fire somewhere, and wake up to something pleasant. From my shopping around, Amazon's price is the best anywhere on this item."
2,Devil is in the details,"This clock doesn't work well for me for a couple of rather specific reasons.First of all, as other have mentioned, the indiglo backlight is too bright at night, and if you turn it down, it becomes difficult to read. My wife's red-on-black alarm clock radio is much easier to read. Part of the reason for this is the fact that I wear glasses, and can't see clearly when I wake in the morning. So perhaps it is me-specific...The other problem I have is that the snooze timer goes off after an hour. So if I'm really tired and keep hitting snooze, after an hour...no more alarm. I've been late to work WAY too many times due to this feature.Overall, it's a fully-featured clock radio, but if you share my little problems, it won't work for you."
1,Timex should stick to watches.,"The sound quality was really poor in my opinion. The Nature sounds were not realistic. Even worse, the sounds were all on a very short loop. The sound of the same Three Large waves crashing over & over again was anything but relaxing. Also there was an annoying clicking noise everytime a sound loop was repeated. (About every 7 seconds). I took it back the same day. Like they saying goes... You can't judge a book by its cover. Sorry Timex. Great watches though!"
4,"Great features, a few kinks","I bought this on impulse and on sale. I love falling asleep to the forest sounds and the timer is a wonderful feature. The volume control features are great! There's no mistaking the snooze button for anything else. The CD player is a bit hard to close. It took me a bit to find the dimmer for the display. Boy, howdy, but it can be bright!"
1,Not worth the money,"You'd think with a name like ""timex"", chronology would be its strong suit. Not the case. I have to adjust the time about once a month. In addition, the cd player sounds terrible. It does look very nice, but if you want to use it for more than looks, don't bother."
3,Not worth THAT much,"I've had this thing for about a year and it's been okay for me. It has a battery compartment so power outages won't screw up the clock. It's pretty easy to set up too.My only real complaints are the ""nature sounds"", the audio quality, and the lack of any anti-skip technology. The ""nature sounds"" are totally horrible. Although I guess you might want something really annoying to wake you up. The sound is pretty bad too. If it's not turned up very loud, probably too quiet to wake you up, it sounds decent. If you turn something up full volume though, it'll definately sound like crap. Not to mention that the actual sound output usually causes the CD to skip. Oh, yeah, the actual sound of the CD spinning is pretty loud too.With all of that in mind I don't think anyone should pay over $40 for this. I gave it a 3 because despite all of those things it always ... right on time."
3,What time is it anyway?,"I thought the other reviews weren't serious about NOT being able to see the time well. My hubby wears glasses, so I wanted BIG digits for him at night. I don't wear glasses, so I'd be able to see fine--I thought! This clock radio sounds great and all the nature sounds are great, but if you want to see the CLOCK (day or night), find another product! We have found we like the alarm sounds, so we have kept our old clock radio (black with red digits) to enable us to see the time, but we set this alarm to wake us."
1,Arrived broken,"CD player never worked. I had to pay to ship it back , and pay ten bucks to get it fixed. Proceed with caution. Something smells bad."
1,1980's Technology,"My radio quit working after 1 year - they only give a 90 day warantee. Since I'm an electrical engineer, I thought I would fix it myself. I couldn't believe the outdated technology they are using! No wonder it only lasted one year."
2,"great clock, bad sounds","The radio itself is a great alarm clock, with the ability to set up to four different alarm times, one for each of waking to sounds, one for a buzzer alarm, and one to wake up to radio.The drawback to this device, however, is the sound. All of the sounds just sound like the white noise you could get by changing your radio to a frequency where there isn't a station. Those sounds that aren't white noise are so short that when they repeat, it's so close that it is just annoying."
1,thought the name brand TIMEX would do better.....,very disappointing. maybe i got a lemon. wish i never bought it.
4,pretty good,this was a pretty good book it wasn't what i expected a little expensive but the pictures are wonderful and the story is very cute.its a good book for a quick read at night.
4,oui oui!,"i loved this book. i got it because i love the people that do Fine clothing, but the book really stands on its own. it's about a kitty who needs a new hat, and she travels to paris to get it. the colors are so great! i love it!"
2,Billionairs'e pregnant mistress,I'm glad that Dimitri realized early in the story that he was a jerk. The story had a good story line but lacked the emotional tug that the author was trying for.
2,Bleh...,It wasn't worth it... No substance or moments on which I felt like I connected with the characters. The writing was also boring and way too cheesy.
4,Great read...,Love the story line... liked how she didn't easily forgive him... made him crawl and answer every hurt... well worth it!!!
5,great book,I really love how this book follows the age old story-line of the billionaire hurting his woman and then after realizing that he loves her. What was so great about this book was that Alex didn't let Dimitri treat her any way he pleased. I always love a strong heroine who can stand up for herself but knows when to back down. Alex is hurt by Dimitri when he doesn't believe the baby is his but she still loves him no matter what lies she tries to tell herself. And it is clear that Dimitri loves her as well and is remorseful about the way he treated her. It was a change from other Harlequin novels where the man finally realizes what an a-hole he's been in the last chapter and the woman forgives him. Dimitri realizes early on that he was wrong and tries to make amends. I felt like they balanced each other out very well and there's was a story that I could believe in and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend this book!
3,Ok!,"I kind of expected more!! It was a decent read, but it could have been better if Dimitri feelings were portrayed more during the story."
1,Disappointing,"The movie itself is well done and well made. But in two tries I was unable to get a disk that played on our DVD player! We have never had a problem with any other DVD, other than once or twice an unexpected spot of digital breakup, which AMAZON replaced for us at no charge. Glitches happen. But we ordered this disk twice and both times it appeared what we were sent had never been recorded: it was blank. Therefore, I don't recommend this. The movie is good but I'll wait until it comes out from another vendor to buy the disk."
3,standard Claire McNab mystery,"the usual Claire McNab mystery -- a brief novel with a little mystery, not much character development, and some funny Aussie-driven observations about LA, a perfect book for the beach. When you're done, if you want to go from enjoyable to outstanding in this genre, try Laurie King's A Grave Talent."
4,Project 86 turns Gothic,"I rated this CD with 4 stars because musiclly, lyrically and in certain songs (""Put Your Lips To The TV"" for one) they have the feel of a good P86 CD but a lot of the songs have the feel of some gothic bands of the 80's and 90's. The first song ""Evil - A Chorus of Resistance"" and ""Ill"" sound like it came off of the group ""The Sisters of Mercy's"" CD ""Vision Thing"". ""Molotov"" is classic ""The Mission UK"". ""Normandy"" gave me a feeling tht I was listening to ""Fields of the Nephilim"".There is enough classic P86 styled songs to keep hard core fans happy and it would be a good add to your collection. I will keep my fingers crossed for their next CD and hope it is as good as ""Drawing Black Lines"", ""Truthless Heroes"" and ""Songs to Burn Your Bridges By"" otherwise P86 might start dropping in my standings."
3,Solid,"All and all a solid effort. This is much more lyrical than their last two. In the songs that actually had a screamo part, the voice could have been replaced with regular singing and would have been marketable by the Newboys. This is in definite contrast to ""...And the Rest Will Follow"" where the screamo style was needed to complete the feel. The lyric content is in line with the rest of their albums. Right now, after three listens, I put it at my fourth favorite.Great packaging and freebee with the pre-order. On a production note, there are a few times on the album where there volume steps down for no apparent reason.It feels sort of like they might have tried to go more commercial (although I consider that a grave accusation). But it could be the group working with different ideas. Personally, I am hoping their next effort feels more like Follow or Bridges.Buy it, you won't regret it."
2,Shipment Damage,"I bought these chairs for a Christmas present for my Wife. When we opened the boxes and removed the chairs from the boxes, we noticed a significant amount of damage on the legs caused mainly by shipping. At closser inspection, we also found poor craftmanship such as excessive glue on some of the joints, as well as the bolts that were sent were not long enough to fasten the front legs. I e-mailed the factory and after sending several pictures of the problems that have agreed to take the chairs back. I am waiting for them to send me a return shipping lable which they agreed to do but have not received it yet. I certainly will not purchase any additional items from this vendor."
3,Decent chairs,The chairs a pretty good for the price. Assembly however was not easy. The holes to attach the legs don't line up very well. Once it was together it is a nice set of chairs.
4,Queen Anne Dining Chairs,These chairs are okay for the price if you are looking for extra seating. Very easy to put together. Did get compliments on them during the holidays.
2,Queen Anne chairs,"We needed two more chairs to try and match our Queen Anne dining set we've had for many years. Not too many are made in this style any more. These chairs looked like a decent match from the photos. It was hard to tell so we took a chance. When they arrived, they just seemed cheap and were also slightly damaged in shipping. Aside from the damage, the chairs were just not comparable to the chairs in the set. Our current set is not ""high end"" at all, but the chairs are lesser than what we already from a quality of build. Color was more red than the picture implies That said, these chairs were incredibly inexpensive and expectations were modest. Even so, we returned the chairs due to the damage. We might have even repaired or touched up the chips had we liked the chairs, but it didn't seem worth it. If your expecattions are very modest, and just need a couple chairs, go for it. But if you're adding to a nice quality dining set, I suggest you look elsewhere"
2,"It gets points for bravery, scariness, and amusement value","I skimmed the book, and was appalled. Logic was absent. As an example, in trying to demonstrate how unlikely evolution was, the author used the example of flipping a set of 10 coins, to calculate the probability that they would all come up heads. His answer was one in 10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 = one in about 4 million. The real answer (pardon my arrogance) is 0.5^10 or about one in 1000.No wonder he thinks we didn't evolve.Read it, and marvel at the things people will believe."
5,Venetian Summer is a summer of peace,"This CD is like being in the ocean breeses without ever leaving home. I enjoy listening to this wonderful flute music while sitting or as I am doing things around the house. The music is very well done and has such a great anointing on it. Thank you, John, for sharing your gift in your music."
2,Subpar,"This ""mystery"" begins with more than the usual tangle of coincidences. A female serial killer who is also a bestselling author witnesses the abandonment of an Alzheimer victim. She is being interviewed by a reporter who is the boyfriend of the victim's granddaughter. Oh, did I mention the winning lottery ticket? Nor is there any mystery, as the reader always knows who is guilty. There's a limited amount of suspense as to whether, how, and by whom the perp(s) will be brought to justice. And it's far from a typical ""cozy"". There are a few of the philosophical tidbits one expects from this author, but really, where's Father Dowling when you need him?"
3,Beginner video only,This is a good video for those just staring to bowl but if you are an experienced bowler looking to improve your game this is probably a waste of money.
3,Great for Beginners,"This is a great video for those interested in getting started in bowling, but not for anyone who has been bowling even for a couple of years. It explains the very basics of bowling in broad details."
2,Looked good but failed to deliver,"I bought this book thinking it would help me to sort out issues I was having in a current relationship. Unfortunately I found the writing style tedious and hard to follow. I am sure there was a message in it but some of it seemed to be religion based and I haven't managed to pick it up long enough to finish it yet. I own my own bible and if I wanted to read scripture I would have picked that up. No doubt others found this book helpful as is evident in other reviews and I don't want to take away from what were obviously positive experiences for them. I also bought ""He's Scared, She's Scared : Understanding the Hidden Fears That Sabotage Your Relationships"" by Steven Carter, Julia Sokol and also available from Amazon. I switched to that halfway through and I found this to be a far more helpful book and ultimately it has helped me a lot more than the book in this review."
3,"Good ideas, less than lucid style","If you are concerned about a fear of intimacy (on your own part, or that of someone you love), this book gives some excellent insights into the problem. Unfortunately, the writing style is so demanding that reading is much slower than it needs to be."
2,Not As I Expected,"This book wasn't what I expected. I was searching for a book about all types of intimacy - friendship, family and romance. But this just focused on romance. Also, the religious quoting and writing throughout the book made me uncomfortable."
4,My Revirew,This is a very good explanation of what I call the merry-go-round effect for the emotions felf by the families of these afflicted persos. You are either up or down and always going around in circles thus causing the family to never get beyond and grow.
4,A worthy addition,"This is a great addition to the Dawn of War series. The Necron in particular add a new twist to the game, as they seem to have a radically different tactical style from the other races. The Tau are probably the ""coolest"" race, yet, with their high energy weapons and battle suits. The new units for the old races don't seem all that new for the most part. A few more limitations on the ability to build large numbers of units have been put in place, as space marines can have only one unit of terminators and one whirlwind tank at a time, now, both of which changes I thought were unnecessary. I had a little trouble getting into the campaign game at first, but after a couple missions, it looks like it is at least as good as the campaign from Winter Assault. The missions are more like skirmish mode battles than scripted missions. In any case, if you liked the first two games, you'll like this."
2,Garbage shaped like Warhammer,"This,just as the previous dawn of war installments did, made sales off of two principles. First it's a strategy game with little actually strategy so the retarded squirrel in your yard could probably play it pretty well. Secondly is fact that they threw warhammer skins on it to attract the fairly large community of warhammer 40k players. Unfortunately they have done a terrible job of making the races in this game feel anything like their tabletop counterparts, the tau being the biggest example of this...They've also managed to ruin a number of older features in this expansion. Infiltration now makes units always invisible and allows them to remain that way while firing... This game is much more frustrating than fun to play."
3,"Great game, good add-on","This is a great add-on to the game, which my son and I have played for many hours. It is easy to play, fun and provides many hours of either solo or online play, especially if you play the campaigns. I highly recommend it."
4,Definite Expansion,"Adds much to the Dawn of War Game. Two new races, Tau and Necron, and a Risk-style campaign game. Excellent as a standalone game or expansion to the original Dawn of War and Winter Assault. Note: you can play any of the previous races in the campaign mode, but can only play the factions in multiplayer that come with the module. So Dawn of War owners can play as Chaos, Space Marines, Eldar, and Orks. Winter Assault owners can play as the Imperial Guard in addition to the above. You can only play as the Tau and Necron in multiplayer if you have just Dark Crusade, but can play as them all if you have the previous expansions."
3,Good - Not Great,"I bought this game as with the hope it can eradicate the bad taste that winter assault left in my mouth. I just see it as two new races with not a whole lot changed...I was hoping for the AI to improve, but it's still quite predictable. Save your $$$ and download some mods for the original DOW."
1,What a waste! Outdated!,"I was so excited about this video! I bought it to show to students going to France. It turned out to be a 10-minute dry, boring documentary that was so dated, I didn't dare show it to my students. I was disappointed to have paid almost $15 for this."
3,re-edit made it crap,"Okay I bought this movie because I bought it when it first came out on VHS and was still called In Your Face. I still enjoy it for how bad some of the acting is, but upon getting this one they cut out a lot of the original dialog and almost have some old school kung fu film dub over on at least one line. That is the only reason I really gave this 3 stars otherwise from it is entertaining and if you enjoy paintball and have kids they may enjoy this film. Things that do not make sense is they redub ""He is just compensating for a tiny little dick"" to ""tiny little Ego"" yet they still left the line ""Dammit Brit is it too much to have some food ready when I get home""Sadly a decent film about a sport I enjoy that went down hill big time thanks to over zealous re-editing that was entirely unnecessary"
3,for paintball lovers only,"Okay, the acting is not worthy of an oscar, but it's a great story for any teen who loves paintball. It's all predictable, but has several different strands going to keep your interest -- if you like paintball. The ""Ian Hunter"" character is memorable, and his pronunciation of paintball from England's perspective is now ingrained in our family lexicon.The action is good, the paintball games real enough, safety concerns are considered very well, and the story keeps me watching even after seeing it a few times with my kids. The language is terrible, lots of four-letter words, but otherwise its great for my kids to watch when they're short of money for paintballs -- and if they like paintball."
3,Looks better in photo,"The watch did not look as elegant, as it does in photo. It was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to others.The watch did arrive in a timely manner, was adequately packaged, and appeared to have been intact.I gave it as a gift and I don't know if it keeps time well."
1,Atomic PC/Desk Clock Leaves Me Timeless,"Perhaps it's because I'm on the East Coast and the NIST transmitter is in Colorado. I could only rarely get any decent reception for the clock. Forget about having the clock in the same room as the computer or TV. It won't work. The instructions say that the best reception is at night, yet the instruction/spec sheet says it automatically checks for the time signal at 12pm...that's right folks at NOON! It didn't work for me and so I returned it. I'm going to look for an AM radio that receives in the range of 5,000 to 25,000khz (shortwave). The NIST transmitter broadcasts in that range at every 5,000khz."
5,Original Sears Craftsman Part? I didn't think so...but,Product doesn't look like an original part. It works just fine though. It was a great price. Then again maybe that is the way Craftsman are replacing parts these days.
4,Informative account of Government manipulation of facts.,I have read almost all of the books out there about the Oklahoma City bombing and the Assault on The Branch Davidians in Waco which is often cited as having been the inspiration for the destruction of the Murrah Building. This book contains LOTS of scathing information regarding The US Governments manipulation of people and its censorship/fabrication of information released to the public. The story it tells is vitally important for all Americans to read although I found the book to be tedious reading in certain areas. Nichols tells his story with all the emotion it deserves and what he has to say is important. Read it!
4,Trigger Fish Fun,"This fish is definitely a fun addition to our pool. It was actually a little smaller than I expected, but it's still cute."
2,Worked only once,My daughter loved this fish and it worked great in the bath 1 time then it never worked again. We tried to replace the batteries but nothing worked. She still loves to play with it but it does not swim anymore.
1,faulty battery compartment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,the battery compartment in this toy sucks! when you put it in the water it fills the battery compartment up with water. it says the tighter the screws the less water can get inside. i had my screws shorted out trying to get it tight and it still got water in it. YOU SHOULDN'T GET THIS TOY ITS A RIP-OFF!!!!!!!
2,sad rip Off,"For those looking for an Emmanuell type picture, this is not it. Granted the lead actor was attractive, but the sex was weak and the story line very flimsy. I bought it thinking it was edgy, and envelope pushing. What I got was some of the worse editing and worse simulated sex ever.A massive wasteof time and money."
1,VERY POOR,"This was definitely not worth the money. It barely deserves an ""R"" rating.There is more exposure on Cinemax then in this movie.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,Laure - decaf,"If you've read the book, the movie is somewhat demure by comparison. Like an Emanuelle movie."
5,personal review,"I read Sybil's Night Ride tomy grandchildren and theywere totally captivated by this wonderful story and they loved the pictures which were so colorful and expressive. The greatest compliment--they want me to take them to follow Sybil's journey. Thank you,Ms. Winnick, for this treasure."
1,DISGUSTING BOOK,"This is a plain simple hate book, and the writer clearly shows that she DOESN'T know how to write at all. This book seemed too unbelievable to be true, I highly recommend to read Princess by Jean P. Sasson."
2,No Caller ID Call Back Function,"This phone has some nice features, including the easy to see back lit display, and the red blinking message light that indicates that my voice mail from the phone co has new messages. The one important feature missing is dial back of numbers shown in caller ID. It saves the 10 digit area code and number, i.e. 555-555-1234. If you press ""display dial"", it dials those 10 digits. In my area, like many, I think, there are times when you must only dial 7 digits, and other times when you must dial ""1"" plus the area code and then 7 digits. Dialing all ten digits for a call within my same area code won't go through, nor will a call outside my area code without a ""1"" before the 10 digits. I have other Caller ID Phones that prompt for these rules during set-up so that they know how to return calls with a one touch call back of the caller ID number shown. This one doen't."
3,"not bad, not great.","Pics up strange signals, maybe from my wifi, which puts the handset on Hold when no one is on the line, or puts the handset into intercom mode.Sound is good. The recently call list works very nice for calling people back."
1,bad connection,This phone didn't work well for us at all. The connection was always bad (fuzzy). My husband just went to Walgreen's and picked up a $10 phone and the connection is much better. I wouldn't recommend this phone.
2,Less than impressed,"The old adage, ""You get what you pay for,"" is applicable here. The base unit was functional enough, nothing special, and seemed to be well made. The cordless handset, although phyically decent, was totally inept and useless. According to the manual it was attributed to ""interference in the 2.4ghz transmission frequency."" There were so many caveats associated with the handset, ""can't be near computer, radio, cell phone, microwave, cable TV, etc...."" The recommended solutions were just as unuseable as the handset, ""unplug the base, unhook the battery, reconnect both"", ""move the base closer to the handset,"" None of those worked, as a matter of fact in total desperation I put the cordless base right next to the corded base unit and it still did not work. I moved them both to the bedroom and still nothing, oh excuse me I did have a clock radio in there so that must have been responsible for insurmountable interference. Ended up returning the unit."
5,Best sounding shelf system available!,"I shopped a very long time for the best shelf system for the best price. This was one of the first ones I found that really impressed me. The sound is extremely clear, and it has more than enough power for a one-room system. I can't stress enough how great this system sounds! I have only one minor complaint- the CD player seems to take a longer time than normal to read the CDs, but you just have to be a bit patient. This system also looks great, which is an added bonus! Highest recommendation!"
4,Worth more than you'll pay..,"I had a very young sales person and he knew what he was talking about. He said ever since they came out with this system, the others on the adjoing shelves stopped selling.The sound is huge for this size and price and it looks and feels good as well.My Cd skips occasionally and I am getting a new box next week (still under warranty). The only other problem I can see with it is there is no record button on the remote. So, you have to get up and down when you want to record that favorite song on the radio. I was very suprised and pleased with this and am more than satisfied with it. It SHOULD cost more. Though I only paid 198."
2,Busy Recipes,"I have tried several recipes from this cookbook, and all of them have too many textures and either too many flavors or not enough flavor. I really hoped this cookbook from one of the big wigs from Cook's Illustrated would help me make hearty vegetarian dishes for my husband, but it failed. Bishop's ""The Complete Italian Vegetarian Cookbook"" is much more palatable."
3,"Good, but not quite as good as previous reviews suggest","This covers the kind of basic veggie cooking many people enjoy. I can see that the 'family' aspects (cooking with wife and two kids) is a good enough reason to buy such a varied collection of recipes if you are cooking for a family of 4. But...don't try the tofu recipes if you have tried Deborah Madison's - Bishop's are lacklustre and will leave you dissappointed. He enthuses about tofu as an ingredient, then gives the most flavourless recipe imaginable! Try Madison's approach of cooking tofu with Asian ingredients and you will see it shine. And as for the quinoa with black sesame seeds in the basics section - it was an unappetising shade of grey. Such a shame. I suspect that his Italian book will be better."
3,Yummy but hard to find,"I really like everything that I have cooked from this cookbook. But, for some of the recipes, the ingredients are difficult to find (for example, zucchini blossoms) The ones I can find are the ingredients to are delicious and not difficult to make."
2,Would have expected much better from C.I. editor,"I will say this is a beautiful cookbook. Lovely pictures. And the recipes are well written, uncomplicated and easy to follow. However, I've made four dishes out of it and all four have been abject failures. At best insipid and uninspired and required a great deal of tinkering; Miso Shitake Mushroom Soup w/ Sesame seeds - who the hell makes a miso soup with straight water and no dashi?!! At worst, destined for the compost bucket; Stir-Fried Rice Noodles with Asparagus and Eggs - utterly flavorless."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,There are no recipes in this book that are even remotely flavorful or interesting. You cannot find a more ho-hum book. The few recipe we tried were terrible. I think he just made up some recipes. I doubt that he actually tested any of these recipes or he has very strange tastes. Bland is the best thing you can say about the recipes in this book. If you want to throw a few vegetables on a plate with olive oil and some herbs then this is your book but why would you need a book for that? Deborah Madison's books are MUCH better.
5,The best vegetarian book,This is the best vegetarian cookbook I have bought. The recipes are all based on what vegetables are in season and the recipes are really tasty. The recipes are easy to prepare and appeal even to picky eaters like myself. You need this cookbook!
5,"Simple, Fast, and Innovative, too!","I really love all of Jack Bishop's cookbooks. I have an entire bookshelf of other vegetarian classics, but I keep coming back to his. This cookbook has a great span of cuisines, good tips, and I like how it is organized by season. A great pick for someone looking to expand their vegetarian recipe collection It has the best squash risotto recipe ever, too..."
5,Truly one of the greatest jazz pianists of this century...,"Page Cavanaugh has been playing jazz piano incredibly since the late 30's, he started his own trio in the 40's with Al Viaola on guitar, and has had various bass players through the years. This CD finds Cavanaugh in top form, in a very creative mood, swinging, and on several tracks singing in his personal and wonderful style. Cavanaugh as always is full of surprises, and is consistantly improviseing and challenging himslef, Cavanaugh has only improved with age, and is better then ever now, on this live and truly exciting set. An absolute must buy for any serious jazz or swing fan."
3,"Great book, but not in great shape like mentioned in description","My 2 year old loves this book. She will sit on the floor and self entertain for quite sometime because she likes putting the bear faces on the pages and putting them back in their ""spot"". A friend of hers tore her first one up so I had to replace it because she missed it. I bought a used one on here from goodwill and was dissappointed that it wasn't in better shape. I had to tape it up when we got it. Anyway, great book and helpful for explaining emotions. I love my daughters ""happy"" face. :)"
5,"gibson Hummingbird acoustic-electric guitar, heritage cherry","I was just playing this guitar-you don't need the electric if you don't wish- and I am astounded (hyperbole) how great it sounds and plays. You can't co wrong with this guitar.I like all Gibsons except ES 355, and this sound is unique. Try one, and I think you will agree."
2,"Love Marvin Gaye, but not a great performance","This performance, if I'm guessing was recorded around 1981, shortly before he left Motown Records to sign on Epic Records.Of course, Madacy Records got hold of the performance and has reissued it numerous times. Clearly a bootleg judging by the sound quality and the fact that Madacy is releasing it, it's uncertain to me why it's even on the market.First off, Gaye is not in top form here. Look elsewhere if you want a Gaye concert with Marvin at 100% and at his finest.Second, the sound quality is not great. I could make a better recording in my basement. And I'm absolutely serious. It's alright for a bootleg, but it's still not great.Overall, unless you are a die hard Gaye fan or a collector, just avoid this. There's nothing here that's standout. Just buy one of his standard compilations. You'll be much happier that way.NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,Awful Live Versions,I thought this cd was a bargain until I listened to it. These were terrible live performances with awful sound recording.DON'T BUY
5,Radar,"Great product. I purchased gthis one because a friend of mine has one and has saved him plenty of times, easy to use, purcgased for a Christmas present, and will be buying one for myself."
1,It lasted several months,"I only used it for several months, then it stopped working completely. Never again."
2,How to Lose a Son in 10 days,"This was one of the worst romantic comedies I've seen in my life! Ugh. The actors are great, but not together. Somehow I kept imagining Sarah Jessica Parker as Carey Bradshaw, and in one particular scene where she contemplates her reasons for sleeping with a client, or rather client's adult son who refuses to move out, it brought back flashing memories of Sex and the City. I almost expected Big to make an appearance.Considering the theme of the movie (deception and love), it all seems like a hollywood formula for a romantic comedy. What saves this movie is the animals that constantly attack McConaughey."
3,Fun!,"It's a fun chick flick. You can't take it too seriously, but there are some funny moments, and MC is always good looking!"
4,Good clean fun,Entertaining chick flick that I think most couples will enjoy.Easy to watch and has some scenes that will make you laugh out loud.
1,what the hell....,"I have no clue why and how somebody like Sarah Jessica Parker is in movies. The only thing she would be good with is flying on a broom, and let her put on a pointy hat. That haaaaaiiiirrrr.... of hers. like a pile of straw. Really hopeless. Totally mismatched with the male lead really. Some scenes were just draaaaging and way too long, e.g. the paintball match and the last part following the pair when they were shut in by their friends... how great was it to watch on a big screen looking like a reality show. It's time for Amazon to bring in minus points for some movies. Even 1 star is too high."
4,It was good,Roger Ebert put this movie on his worst movies list. I thought it was a good lighthearted movie. Not all that funny but good for movie night when there's nothing else to watch.
2,bleh,Matthew McConaughey is quite possibly the most annoyingly bad actor ever. This movie has a stupid story and even stupider comedy. Stay away.
1,one of the worst movies I've ever seen,This movie was absolutely horrible. I've never seen such a ridiculous plot and poor acting.Save your time and watch something else.
2,So-so =,"This romantic comedy was made in 2006 starring Sarah Jessica Parker as ""Paula"" and Matthew McConaughey as ""Trip"" - the romantic leads...Paula has a unique job as an ""Interventionist"" - which helps ""launch"" young men from living with their parents after a certain age -(around 26 years old).Trip loves living at home with his parents - they feed him, they take care of housekeeping, and he is comfortable. He is 35, has a job, and enjoys all kinds of sports. hat Trip's ""extra"" benefit of living at home with his parents is to ""use"" when he wants to end a relationship. Trip's parents want to enjoy their retirement - have fun and privacy again. They hire Paula to ""Launch Trip"" out of their home. Paula falls for Trip, but there are hurdles to overcome.Some of the slapstick humor by the supporting cast makes for a good laugh, but overall the plot is predictable and is a basic romantic formula."
3,Nothing Special !!,"I dont think this movie really had much I mean it was just okay. There was nothing really special about it, I thought that it was going to be a romantic comedy and it really was either. I saw it and now that's it. Nothing to refer a friend or family member to."
3,3 3/4 stars,"I watched this movie with some family, and I found that the older the person was in my family, the more they enjoyed this movie. For me, I found it mildly amusing, made a little better by the fabulous Kathy Bates (Great Actress!) I didn't think Matthew and Sarah had all that great of chemistry, so it made their relationship hard to believe. But, it had some good dialogue, and was, overall an ok movie. :)"
5,good movie,This movie is good to watch especially that is had Matthew in it who I like to watch and also the price was reasonable from the seller.
3,Overdue hatchling needs a push out of the nest,"A 35 year old bachelor still lives at home with his parents until they hire Paula, an interventionalist, to push him out of his house and into his own bachelor pad. The trouble she begins to lose her professional distance and he actually confronts why he is so afraid of growing up. A romantic comedy that has Sarah Jessica Parker as Paula, a woman who gets Peter Pan to become a man, against a charming eternal man-child."
4,Entertaining comedy with an important point!,"As a comedy, this has plenty of merit. Terry Bradshaw (who is nearly as good a comedic actor as he was a quarterback) and Cathy Bates (who is a truly gifted actress in every respect) play the roles of a couple who cannot get their adult son to leave home! They retain the services of a young lady to resolve this problem, and shall we say that complications arise (not to spoil the plot for you).Anyway, I can fully recommend this movie as a comedy. For those who have been unable to get their 20+ offspring to leave the house and go off on their own, well maybe watching this movie together will give them the hint. If not, you can always change the locks! :-D"
4,Romantic Comedy That Offers Something So Different,"While Failure To Launch offers all the makings of your typical Romantic Comedy, it does offer a little something extra in that the ""Romeo"" of the story is a middle aged man still living at home with mom and dad. And, as can be expected, Mom & Dad want him out. And how, praytell, do they expect to accomplish this goal? How else other than hire a woman to make their son fall in love and want to move out! But, as can be expected, it simply isn't that easy. And that is where the barrel of laughs start rolling in. And you won't stop laughing until the end.This is not just a chick flick. This is a movie that men and women both will enjoy!"
3,Could have been better.,"The movie could have been better if they didn't have Sara Jessica Parker in the movie, I just don't care for her and I thought she looked too old to be playing that part. The parts of the movie that she was not in them, were good."
3,Not one you'd watch twice,"It has some funny moments, but overall I found Failure to Launch extremely predictable with Sarah Jessica Parker acting the same as she always does. MAtthew McConaughley is watchable but is not an outstanding actor by any means. To be fair, this is a light-hearted movie which is meant for a little fun, and in that respect works."
1,"Mindless, immature fluff","Wow. I am now 30 minutes into watching this ""masterpiece"" and I can barely stand it. The humor is juvenile; scenes are a random, disjointed mess; acting is flat. Horrid. This is a perfect example of a movie that has no substance trying to distract viewers with cutesy scenes. Thank god, I am watching it for free."
1,This launch is a complete failure,"Another big budget, crappy, unfunny, stupid, pointless, predictable romantic comedy.....who watches this tripe?!?!?!?"
1,bad,I like both of these stars seperately but together they really stink. The plot is horrible and predictable thrown in with stupid animal/ human jokes and nakedness by a very old man. This movie was a complete waste of time.
3,failure to launch,the case that came with this dvd was clear. it wasn't the original case and this should have been stated in the product info. i would not have paid as much as i did for just a dvd and a clear case.
3,More of a Guy Movie than I expected.,"This isn't really a chick flick. There are too many wacky incidents and weird characters for it to be a true romance, I think. Not that that's a bad thing. I think too many romances take themselves too seriously. In any case, it was engaging and entertaining, and a fun movie to watch if you're not really in the mood for anything intellectual."
2,Failure To Launch,Rather silly spoof about a young man not leaving home because his mom does all his chores. The last part of movie best when (Matthew McConaughey) Tripp starts acting like the adult he is. Cute little ditty that is entertaining and nothing much else and only worth watching when nothing else to do.
4,"Funny, cute, redundant plot","Cant help but love a romantic comedy. It salves the reality of life. Escapes even.yet, the plots lately only vary by the names, locations and hair color of the stars, which is making them too predictable.Enjoy anyway . I did."
4,This is a comedy....Not a serious biography,"If you want to have fun get this movie. I laughed so much during this movie and I had a good feeling when it was over. This movie is a refreshing break from the same old same old comedies starring those 2 loosers from the Adam Sandler movies. If they let film get wasted making Duece Bigalow, scary movie and any of the Wayans Brothers movies then no one should complain about simple funny movies.Good Job with this one. Sarah Jessica and Matthew M. have great on screen presence. This is a good choice to save when you are having a stressful day. Laughter can relieve almost anything."
4,Failure to Launch,This was a good movie that pulled on you heart-strings. I would recomend to anyone who loves chick flicks!!
3,Terry Bradshaw in the Raw,"Although not Oscar material, this movie was still a delightful romp and a laugh a minute. Great cast. Terry Bradshaw was an absolute hoot! Now I understand the interview I saw on Fox with Bradshaw and McConaughey some time back when Matthew said Terry was really raw in the movie. Thank God he kept his back to the camera. Bet he gets some ribbing from the Steelers over his locker room dress. Highly recommended for a good laugh."
3,Failure to Launch,"Not the usual Matthew McConaughey movie. Rented it because he was in it. Found his character was dual, now that I think about it everyone was dull. His father put a little humor in the story. Sarah Jessica Parker looked old.Would rate the movie ** Didn't get the title. She did get him to move out from his parents house."
4,Zooey Deschanel steals the show. :o),"This was a fairly decent movie, quite funny and Sarah Jessica and Matthew do a pretty good job. However Zooey Deschanel has the funniest lines in the entire movie. ""You are a dirty little fun-haver"" got most of my co-workers motivated to rent this flick. She was absolutely hillarious. Kathy Bates wasn't used to her fullest and the retired football player they got to play the dad has to be the worst actor/athlete since Shaq. However it was worth the rental."
3,Cute Date Movie,"not a bad movie about a guy that never leaves his parents house. its not smart humor, and relies on gags such as getting bitten by squirrels and falling off boats and into the water. but all that aside, its a movie you can watch on a date and never really be annoyed or angery or board."
4,Why the low rating?,"We rented this movie three or four nights ago at about 9:00. We started it as soon as everybody was downstairs and never stopped it. What can I say? I loved it! I still don't understand why it got such a low rating. I mean, this film is hilarious. True, the two lead actors aren't my favorite, but Kathy Bates ""Sue"", Terry Bradshaw ""Al"", Bradley Cooper ""Demo"", Justin Bartha ""Ace"" and Zooey Deschanel ""Kit"" made the trip worthwhile. I have to say that my two favorite characters are Ace and Kit.Great movie. Looooove iiiiiiit!4/5"
3,It's okay,Movie is ok. I'm not a big Jessica Parker fan so really not fair to have me review it. Movie ends as one would expect.
1,misunderstood,"Idk why, but this doesn't work on any dvd player I own. I also bought one for my aunt, as a gift, and wouldn't work on her new dvd player either. Good thing I didn't pay too much for these, cuz we had to toss them..."
2,Apt title,"I'm glad I missed this one the first time around, as it certainly isn't worth wasting your money on in DVD format or as a download. Hard to imagine anyone wanting to ""collect"" this title, which I guess is why it sells for 6 bucks and some change. I see it is $0.01 used. McConaughey and Jessica Parker essentially spend 90+ minutes primping in front of the camera, with whatever humor provided by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw as Tripp's parents. The idea of a 35-year-old live-in son is plausible enough, but the easy going life he leads as he tootles around in his vintage Porsche 911 is the kind of nonsense one comes to expect in such romantic romps. The only saving grace of this film is Zooey Deschanel, as Parker's oddball roommate."
5,Love it!,"I think its hilarious. Guys take note, this is a terrific romantic comedy that MOST women will warm too. My fiance told me that Matthew McConaughey spent too much time trying to be cute, and he's right, but I dont care. I love this movie, and your girls will love it too!"
3,A stupid story line but it's overall cute,"Ok this is a chick flick so we all know stuff like this will not happen in real life. The story it self is pretty stupid a good looking guy is still living at home who happnds to be 35. The premise is very stupid as if that would ahppen it dose but did you see what he looks like. There are cheap laughs but through out the film. The good thing is the chemistry is great and Sarah jessica Parker is lovely. the film has funny moments and it's good if you turn your mind off. When the film is over you think was it good or bad but it falls on trhe border line of good and bad, but it was enjoyable."
1,By far the worst movie of SJP's career,"This poorly-written script was unworthy of Kathy Bates and SJP. I can't imagine why on earth it got green-lighted; it's nothing but a collection of cliches and physical gags with a phony relationship at the core. I never believed for a second that Paula and Tripp cared for one another; they were completely one dimensional, cardboard characters. Utter dreck unworthy of even diehard fans of these actors."
3,Launch Right Into My Funny Bone,This was a good movie mostly because of the co-stars especially Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates who plays Tripp frazzled parents who tries to get their 35 year old son to move out played Matthew C. It you want a simple and engaging movie to watch this it. P.S. A naked Terry Bradshaw what not to laugh at.
2,"An Avid fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, Not so big fan of this film","Being an avid fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, I thought this might be a movie I would like. However, it turns out; I am not a big fan of this film. The film is cliché at best and while both actors give a good performance it's a has been there done that type of movie with an all too familiar plot and character assignment.With Parker playing the carrot to get McConaughey to move out of his parent's house, it actually reminded me of the complaints I often hear in relationships. When will he get on his own two feet? Why does she still live with her parents? While it would seem this commonality would make this movie a sure fire hit because most people can relate to it, this movie misses the mark with little or no chemistry amongst the performers. This is a must miss movie that definitely fails to launch."
3,Harmless and Predictable Entertainment.,This is one of those inconsequential date movies that are predictable from beginning to end. You actually know what's going to happen every step of the way. Great for those Friday nights when we turn off our brains from time to time.Matthew and Sarah are just there; they really don't have to act. Their characters are kind of plain to say the least. The secondaries Zooey and Kathy steal the show. Only for them this gets three stars.
2,Overly cutesy predictable comedy,"""Failure to Launch"" a mindless comedy featuring Matthew McConaughey as Tripp a 35 year old bachelor that still lives at home with his parents, suffers from a failure to entertain. His parents hire Sarah Jessica Parker playing professional interventionist Paula to seduce McConaughey into a relationship to get him out of the house. Terry Bradshaw is surprisingly funny as the father Al. Kathy Bates' superior acting talent is wasted in her role as enabling mom, Sue.As expected Parker falls in love with McConaughey and problems ensue. Yeeeesh! Had I not been a captive on a trans Atlantic flight, there is no chance that I would have chosen to see this moronic flick."
5,SOOOOOO FUNNY!!!!!!,Who ever likes(loves) Mathew well this is the movie for you. It is soooo funny i love it and if you like dating or romatic and funny movies this is for you. So i recommend this for anyone who wants to laugh.
2,Failure to Entertain,"This is one of those movies that you watch and then, within a few days, you forget about.Sarah Jessica Parker plays Paula, a ""launcher"" or something. Parents hire Paula to coax their adult children into leaving home and getting a place of their own. Sound stupid enough for you already?Paula is hired by the parents of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) and the story is about how, during the course of her employment, she falls in love with him, and he with her. There are a very few laughs along the way.Some might call this a ""chick flick"" but my wife (who is a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and ""Sex and the City"") didn't like it either."
2,"Unfunny, Unforgettable Torture","I give this film an extra star because it has one decent scene between Tripp (McConaughey) and his mother (Kathy Bates), where Mom says Tripp served as a buffer between her and his father (Terry Bradshaw), and now she's concerned that his father won't like her if Tripp leaves.It was the only genuine moment in an incredibly plastic picture.There are some funny moments, like when Tripp's father calls Sarah Jessica Parker a tramp, and offers to take Tripp out in the woods and shoot him to save some money. The scene with the Star Wars nerd and Parker on a paid date is entertaining: she plays Darth Vader's march on a kazoo, and he gets all overexcited. Then she ditches him. Zooey Deschanel plays Parkers' kooky roommate (sister?) Kit, and has the right stuff with Tripp's friend Ace (Justin Bartha) in a funny scene where they almost kill a mockingbird. The Daily Show's Rob Corddrey shows up to explain why the joke is funny to anyone still enjoying the film."
3,Good for a few laughs,I liked this predictable movie. I thought it was cute. Paula (sarah Jessica) has a strange roommate that added a little fun to this movie. As well as Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw as the parents. I enjoyed this move although I knew it would be predictable. I am a fan of Sarah. But I didn't run to the theater to see this one
3,Nothing's great but it's okay,"This is a bit weird so I decided to write it down - I undeliberately picked up a copy of Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (Warner Bros books) just 3 days before I watched this DVD and half way through the film I realised that the classical title is part of the action in it... except that they nearly killed one!The geeky characters of both Kit (Zooey Deschanel) and Ace (Justin Bartha) are the only pure, original spice for this tasteless, very cliché, love-in-disguise flick. Why? First of all for sure you can dismiss McConaughey's usual suave screen appeal, Parker is her typical annoying, shrieking here and there and all jumpy girly character, and Bates... OMG, for one sec I thought she's going to strip again (echoing ABOUT SCHMIDT) following the scene of a walking naked [...] of Terry Bradshaw!Nothing else's great but it's okay if you've got nothing to do and feel a little geeky on a long weekend for a pastime movie."
3,Lighthearted Romantic Comedy,"""Failure"" is sure to please most audiences. Not strictly a ""chick flick"", Failure to Launch follows the formula of most screwball romantic comedies and provides some hilarious moments, particularly the nude scene with Terry Bradshaw. Who knew he could act?Kathy Bates is delightful as usual in her role of Matthew McConaughy's ambivalent mother, and Sarah Jessica Parker, even though the protagonist of the story, is a sympathetic character nevertheless, and displays her great comedic timing so well put to use in the HBO ""Sex & the City"" series.Matthew McConaughy takes his shirt off at least once, proving that regardless of his performance as an actor he is a fun to watch. He fits so well into the character's skin, it's hard to imagine any other actor in that role.2 Popcorns, No hankies."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I am an English Literature Educator and I decided to concentrate on some new reading strategies for this upcoming school year. After reading the wonderful reviews, I felt like I could do no wrong in purchasing this book. Guess what? I was wrong. These mini-lessons are not practical and are not really geared to help reading comprehension in the least. I admire the author's knowledge of reading as a study, but now have a book that will sit on my shelf for the rest of my career. I wish I could see what others found to be so special about it. Perhaps I am just too much of a realist and I know that this is not something that will work in my class. If I find it boring-- I can't imagine what my middle grade students will think. Really-- don't get it. If you must, first go check it out in person and take a look through it before you waste your precious money."
1,Boring Reading!,"I was expecting this book to have lots of creative ideas for high school students. Instead, there was way too much rhetoric and too little in the way of actual good lessons. This book was a disappointment."
5,Reading Reasons,Reading Reasons has really helped me in my high school reading classroom. Kelly Gallagher is right on with his thoughts!
5,Super book,"This book has been very helpful as I work with struggling middle school readers. It gives me great things to share with my students on the beneifts of being a ""good"" reader."
5,Stalag Luft III,"I purchased this specifically for my husband's interest in the real ""The Great Escape"" story and information behind Mis-X; so, thanks to the seller. The book was in as good a condition as one should expect for it's age."
1,Leave This Album Alone,"Words cannot express how horrible this album is...but i'll try anyway. Sounding like it was recorded with a $10 Casio keyboard in someone's coat closet, ""Leave Bill Clinton Alone"" ranks just above ""The Super Bowl Shuffle"" and ""Convoy"" in the pantheon of nauseating novelty songs. If Bette Midler were deceased, she'd be spinning in her grave at the sound of Hargrove's rendition of ""Wind Beneath My Wings"". Heck, even Calloway has the right to be disgusted with Hargrove's version of ""I Wanna Be Rich."" The book-ends of this album, ""Leave Bill Clinton Alone"" (and then what was likely meant to be some sort of ""Leave Bill Clinton Alone"" reprise), are simply indescribable. Simply put: SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,won't read my Olympus 1GB XD card. Seems buggy.,"I shoot Olympus cameras and I bought this specifically because Amazon says it supports Compact Flash and the XD formats. My Sandisk 8 GB Extreme IV card seems to be working just fine with it. My 1GB Olympus XD card on the other hand is not recognized at all. I'm using the reader from a late model iMac running OSX 10.5 (Leopard). Swapping between the two cards seems to confuse the reader such that the CF card isn't always recognized after I attempt to read the XD card. I have to unplug the reader to get it to reset and read the CF card. All-in-all, I'd say it's a buggy and unreliable product. Since it won't read my wife's XD card it is a useless piece of trash and a total waste of money as far as I am concerned. I have to go buy another reader and hope that when the description says it reads XD and CF that it really does."
3,Not the clearest documentation,I spoke to the company after receiving this item because it does not show anywhere in the documentation or on the device where you can insert an xD card. I thought I was going to have to return it. It turns out that the device was updated after the packaging and documentation and that you can put an xD card in the Smart Media card slot.
1,DIDN'T WORK,The memory card came in a previously opened package and some of the contents indicated on the package were missing. And then it didn't work!! I sent it back to Amazon.
1,dishonest,"I ordered a book that was suppost to be new.I am a chiropractic student and am building my library for when I open my clinic and felt this book would be a great addition. When I opened the package I could tell before I even took it out that it was not new! The pages had marker on them and there are stains inside the cover. The corners are banged in and it looks like it was on someones floor for a while, not to mention there was a curley hair in between the back cover and page .This book is not in any condition to add to a professional library."
5,I've had them for several years now...but...,"Actually I'm running strips of the 3 and 4-lamp swivel fixtures off of a 1.5 volt power supply in the living room and hall. I attached HO model railroad track onto decorative ceiling wood and snap the LED fixtures onto the track with clips for mount and electric pickup. They're beautiful...and the cost is only a tiny fraction of what an equal track lighting system would be. And 100,000 hour LED's all on only a few watts of power. I'll keep adding these to my system. Thanks RiteLite and Amazon.For the battery folks...remember that there's no free ride, light output for battery use. If you're going to put a lot of hours on it then get some little AAA rechargeables."
2,dont buy this!,I had ordered 3 of these thinking it would work well!The batteries don't last it drains them quickly!This would be better wired!Don't waste you money on this!
3,Rite Lite for a small cabinet,I purchased this light for a cabinet that we turned into a bar. It is just the right amount of light and looks really sleek. The moveable lights can be adjusted. One drawback is that it takes 6 AAA batteries.
1,Don't buy,This product is great for about a day. Then the batteries die and you have no light. Manufacturer needs to reconfigure so that the lights hold a charge.
2,"Great idea, poor quality.","I wish I would have listened to the past reviews. Most of the past reviews were unfavorable, but I thought the toy was so cute and the idea of a Thomas the Train bath toy was great since my son loves Thomas. The idea is great, but the quality is poor. Here's why: The toy connects in pieces such that you have a floating Island of Sodor, and Thomas can ride up and down the track into a blue tower with an elevator mechanism. What doesn't work well is that the pieces don't fit well together so the island actually breaks apart when any slight pressure is placed upon the toy. And because the island doesn't stay together, the other parts like the tunnel don't stay on either. My son loves this toy, but we can't make it through bath time without it breaking apart. I am willing to attempt a repair just so we can keep playing with it, but you shouldn't have to do that. This toy is a great concept, but could have been made more durable."
1,Not Sodor-able,"Our son loves anything Thomas so we thought this would be a great bath toy for him. Oh how wrong were we. As soon as I pulled it out of the box and looked at the directions I knew we were going to have problems. The two main pieces of this island, which provide support for the tunnel and ramp, do not hook together in any way. They rest next to each other and the orange ramp and blue tunnel snap together on top of them. So any time your child attempts to roll Thomas down the ramp or bring him up the blue tunnel piece, the base comes apart. It's not so durable. I'm open to the super glue idea, but I don't even see where you would super glue the island together. My son who can play alone with a Thomas train for hours played with this island for about 5 minutes then abandoned the island and set off to play with just the little Thomas train that came with it."
2,It won't stay together!,"We were very excited to find a new Thomas toy that we did not already have. And it's a bathtub toy. Sounded great. All of you with sons that love this adorable train know what it's like to have about everything thomas and to find something different. Well, this toy won't stay together. The pieces do not articulate well. So, when we go to roll the train, the whole thing falls apart and we spend another 3 minutes putting it back together. :( And do not expect to use it in the tub. It's so bulky. It does float. But since the pieces don't exactly fit together well, it tends to topple over if floating when you go to roll the train. Bit disappointing overall. Our finale with this toy was when the elevator part broke (and we only had it three days...not played with hard by any means since we spent most of our time putting the pieces back together).As a side note, the train that comes with it is cute and works well in the tub."
2,Falls Apart,"This toy comes in several pieces that snap together but after about two minutes in the bathtub, the parts have disconnected and are floating in the tub. I spend much of bath time just putting the toy back together. I wish they snapped together a bit more tightly."
2,Barely 2 stars,"Thankfully, ours was bought at a yard sale, so I'm not upset about the money we spent on this toy - but the fact that it was basically new in the box should have been a clue. As others have posted, this toy does not stay together well (though I've seriously thought about the super glue idea). The train is very difficult to go through the tunnel. The elevator doesn't work well and doesn't tip the train out. But despite all this, my 2 yr old still enjoys it. (At least as long as I'm willing to repeatedly fix it for him.) If it was full price, it would have been returned."
2,Toy does fall apart ALL the time.,I agree w/ everyone else! This toy falls apart almost every time my son touches it. I like the super glue idea!!!!! It causes great frustration because the train doesn't fit right and I am forever putting it back together. My son did like it but now he just plays w/ the train.
3,This is an ok case.,"This is not the best gameboy advanced case, but it is ok. The string does break off very quickely and it does not hold that many games and it is ver big and bulky."
3,Not the best case,"This is not the best gameboy advanced case, but it is ok. The string does break off very quickely and it does not hold that many games and it is ver big and bulky."
4,Very Nice,"This is a super cool case! It's got a pocket JUST ROOMY enough to hold your GBA. And in the back of it it's got another zippered pocket that has tons of room to put a worm light, a few games, a multiplayer link cable, and one more little thing you might need. It's got extra padding and it's very protective! You can carry it around in your hand or use the velcro straps in the back to hook it onto your belt. It would be nice if it had a little more room, but right now it's perfect! BUY IT!!"
4,"Ok for starters, but GBA gamers, get a bigger one","I got this pack when I first got my GBA with two games. I works well but when your games gets to about 8, its way to small especialy when you hold other things such as a light, link cable, and instruction booklet. Take my advice and go with the next size bigger its much more usefull all the way around"
5,Awesome case!,This case is the perfect size. It can hold up to 16 GBA games and there is enough room for accesories. If you're looking for a case this ones great mainly because its not bulky it isnt that bulky.
4,"More ""Spanish"" in Blue","This is a terrific album and I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that of the four pieces only two were in the Spanish motif. Carter arranges traditional Spanish themes with basic jazz notes that sound less improv so the spanish flavor is strong. The other 2 pieces while ok,for me would have been better served on another album. That being said,I strongly recommend the album for the 2 ""Spanish"" pieces alone."
3,"Hmmm, so so stuff, but fun","You know, sometimes the memory plays tricks. I thought this was better then than now. Maybe it was. Without Jim and Rusty, is there really a Cactus? I think not. Is it still fun? Sure it is! Is it still Cactus? Not by definition created by the first three outings!"
3,Good Jam Disk,This is a good disk for folks that are excited with flashy guitar jams. The songs themselves leave me wanting more.
4,Darwin's World - Post Apocalyptic Mayhem!!!,"Darwin's World 2nd Ed is an excellent compilation with everything necessary to run a post-apocalyptic game. It is clear, concise, and is HUGE. Very pleased overall. Hopefully this series will do well enough that in the third edition we will be able to get color artwork. A minor negative, but with such a large book, the cost would have been prohibitive.Well done!Ben Waxman PA-C"
4,A Cool gadget !,"Its a really cool piece of work. I was surprised to see how much power it had. The motor is a little bit big though.And the gadgets it contains are really useful. (Specially the stuff like the torque-limiter, the cardanic joint and differential.But there are cons. The wire connecting the battery box and the motor is way too short. it only becomes useful if u r placing the battery box in side or right next to what ever you are building. It would've been really cool if the set contained another cable with extra length.And the packaging is not made of the same hard cardboard like other lego sets. So it would be a good idea to store them in a different palstic container to avoid losing any parts :)"
1,Over Priced,"I had bought this motor for my son and upon arrival learned the actual motor is quite small and this unit is older technology. For 229 dollars, I was expecting a much more robust motor and a lot more gears to build better projects. We returned the set for a discounted refund."
2,It works but poorly constructed,"If you are looking for a sharp, well built clock for your office this isn't the one. It works as advertised but I was surprised at the shoddy workmanship and finish on the bezel. The joints have huge gaps in them and the wood has multiple nicks & scratches as well as a very poor finish. Mine is going out in the barn where it will fit in quite well.Final update: I called the company that makes this clock and told them about the battery eating nature of the thing. They gave me an RMA number and shipped me a new clock which has been working fine for the last two weeks and has a much nicer fit and finish."
2,It's a classic alright...,"People have always said this was a classic. Now after listening to the soundtrack, I know its a classic bore! This may have worked in the visual medium but on audio I had to fight to keep myself awake."
5,Great Little Projector for Great Price,"This particular projector is no longer in production, but InFocus is still producing lots of similar, more up-to-date products. InFocus seems to be a popular brand to have in schools as both my college and the high school I now work at have them in every classroom. I really like this projector! It's bright enough to see in my apartment with ambient light from the glass door in the late afternoon, and it has good resolution with a crisp focus. It's not HD or anything, but it certainly is comparable to most computer monitors. The keystone and other adjustment features are not very delicate, but the functionality is available if needed. Overall, I like it, and I ordered a second one too!"
1,Very Disappointing!,"As an avid fan of all things Wonderland and a voracious manga reader I anxiously awaited this volume; I even pre-ordered, something I rarely do. What a disappointment!The story hit most points from the Alice story, yet with none of the charm, wit, adventure or madness of the original. The art also disappoints. Alice looks like a rip-off of Penny from the Inspector Gadget cartoons. The artist doesn't show the faces of the Duchess or the Red Queen in what seems to be either laziness or inability, and not some artistic affectation. For some inexplicable reason the Mad Hatter is a cartoon-version of Jay Leno complete with a huge chin and a goofy grin. Though it is a re-telling of an existing story, I expected originality and got none. This doesn't even rise to the level of mediocrity.Despite my unreasonable need to acquire all things Alice, future volumes of Rod Espinosa's series will not be on my list. What a shame!"
1,What a big disappointment,"I love the Alice in Wonderland story, and I also like manga, so when I saw this book I thought ""What a perfect combination!"". I ordered it right away. When I finally got it I read it from cover to cover in minutes. By the time I finished I was so disappointed by the book I decided to return it. Even if I wouldn't get my full refund (shipping charges not refundable if it was my mistake), it was worth it to get the little money I could for it. The art work was very unimpressive and the story, was the same story, but somehow seemed boring! There's even an intro where Rod Espinosa himself explains how he ripped off the idea of doing a manga on a classic from someone else...it's already really hard to make your own work sound interesting, I guess it's even harder when you're telling everyone that this wasn't even your idea to begin with. After I read the intro, I already felt cheated. Anyhow, like I said, big disappointement."
1,Handset Quality Very Bad,I loved my previous VTech and so expected good quality from this one too. No such luck. The base is fine but both handsets I purchased have intermittent reception. I don't know what is causing the interference and I don't care. All other cordless phones have always worked fine around here.
2,cordless phones won't charge,"don't waste your money.. i had bought a base unit and 3 handset units. the base works fine, the handset units all have problems charging. Vtech tech support said it's the batteries.. they send me new batteries, but the problem still remains.. i think it's the design of the handset charger, does not make good contact to properly charge the units."
2,It's NOT 5.8 GHz,"The cordless phone works, and is clear. But be warned. This is not a true 5.8 GHz phone. The base transmits at 5.8 GHz, but the phones transmit at 2.4GHz. So if you're buying this in order to reduce interference with a wireless network (or from a microwave), look elsewhere. It will not solve your problems."
1,Problem Buttons on VTECH 5820,The buttons used to turn off the phone and the 3 buttons just below the display require repeated attempts before they work which is very frustrating to use. I made an indepth product research before buying this phone and am very dissatisfied with this phone. I would not buy it again and am currently looking for another BRAND of phone to replace it. I won't buy another VTECH again.
1,DON'T BUY THIS PHONE,"I bought it and the charger units slowly died, one by one. Now, 9 months later I have 3 phones with only one charger working...it is VERY frustrating. I am going to do more research before I buy again. I agree with the other reviewer, there is some problem with the charger base not making contact with the phone..."
4,Good phone,The volume of the receiver is a little low. This phone does not intefere with 802.1g wireless network in my house. Good design
1,VTech 5831 Sound Fades,"There is a problem with the sound. I have two handsets. The one I use the most fades out periodically. I can't say if the other has the same problem, as it's not used as often. Mainly for this reason I don't recommend this phone. We'll see how the warranty works."
2,Poor sound quality,The phone is hard for both parties to understand and the volume is low. I have to use the speaker phone setting for most conversations. People on the other end of the line always ask me whats up with my phone. I have had 2 different multi extension phones and neither has had the same sound quality as my old vTech $20 single line cordless.
3,Phone problem with battery compartment,The battery compartment didn't hold batteries inside firmly to make good connection - had to correct with duct tape. Works fine now.
1,Griffin Needs to Get Back Into Action,"We turn to Griffin for action, but Special Ops is about getting ready for action. The first chapter, a flashback, is exciting but thereafter the theme is preparation-assembling a covert force, getting it and its equipment to Africa, watching the bad guys, and planning the attack, a predictable setpiece. I also object to page after page of copies of messages. A quarter of each is information-jargon, hard to read, but information. The rest is heading, classification, signature, and blank space. Padding. Finally, it is annoying to find the head of the CIA called the Director of the CIA. His title is Director of Central Intelligence, DCI. (It is an easy mistake, like referring to Rehnquist as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; his title is Chief Justice of the United States.)"
2,"I read it, but it was far from my favorite.","I have read all of the Brotherhood of War novels, and my favorites were the first two, by a long shot. I would rather see a ""fill in the blanks"" book about Craig Lowell's adventures in Vietnam! In the book ""The Generals"", we are told that Craig goes to Vietnam as a Lt. Col., and comes back a full Colonel with more medals, of course. One thing that bothered me about this book... the ending of ""The Aviators"" was re-written in this book to include Jack Portet, which seems very tacky. I have read the other Brotherhood of War novels so much that my copies are falling apart! I wish this novel had been as good as the others."
2,Ridden with errors,"I am still about a hundred pages from the end of the paperback version of this book, but there is no doubt it was written in haste and not up to the normal standard of Griffin's work. I have two pages of errors listed on my computer in the first 150 pages... You know I have long thought that there is a team of writers at work on these books, rather than one author. That might explain the repetitious nature of the books, and the clangers that get dropped in."
5,Great as always,"Having spent twenty plus years my self in the army, WEB Griffen has told it like it is. I have read all of his books and hope he continues to write more."
3,Special Ops,The purpose of buying a hardcover novel was to ensure the type size would be large enough to read comfortably. Unfortunately the print is paperback small and quite uncomfortable.
2,Slow going,"I am a big fan of W E B Griffin and this book was a big disapointment. The story moves very slowly. I am used to Griffins style of repeating things and I actually enjoyed the ""Blood and Honor"" series which many readers found too dull. But, I thought this book was even duller. You have to be a real Griffin devotee to get through this!"
2,Brotherhood Series,"I found that the last 4 of the brotherhood series were written not as a continuation of the original 5, but as stand alone books. I found it boring to have the same background continuously repeated it almost seemed like Griffin was filling in space with some of the writing. I also found that there was not continunity within the last 4 books, the story seemed to jump around in its story line."
4,I really enjoy this series but....,"Since this is the last book I thought I would sum up my review here. I read these books about 10 years ago and picked them up at the used book store. Look, I like these books quite a bit. I won't go into all of it y'all read them if you got here the only problems I have ever had are his loose play with the facts. My major complaint is so tupid but... How many times is Sandy Felter offered ""ham and eggs"" do his life long friends not know he is jewish? In the earlier books it is made pretty clear he and Sharon are observant jews. If some one can explain that one please let me know."
2,I usually don't read this type of novel,"And I don't expect the quality of writing in serious literature but there are subjects he seems to be winging it on and really doesn't know much about. There is a lot on Argentina which Mr. Griffin obviously does know a lot about but I'm not sure how this much on Argentina fits.There is a lt colonel investment banker, a lot polo which fits well with Argentina and investment bankers, they are all staying in luxury digs in the keys, and lots of drinking and fine dining. No middle class officers here.All in all not a particularly interesting book, not believable, and not terribly well written."
3,Entertaining action and characters,"Having not read previous books in the series I cannot comment on how it fits the series. I am generally a pure military history reader but occasionally pick up an historical fiction such as this so I have only read a couple of Mr. Griffin's other works. I must say, Mr. Griffin knows how to weave a great plot and create a depth of characters like few other authors. I enjoyed this work very much. At times it seemed to move a little slow but the time spent in understanding and relating to the characters pays off when the action and mystery unfolds. All in all, the book gives you an enjoyable time in service with the early Special Operations forces.The reader in this edition also did a great job of appropriate emotion in the reading."
4,WEB GRIFFIN DOES IT AGAIN.,"The Brotherhood of War series has been a real revelation to me about the US Army, and Special Ops is yet another example. It is a readable story with a good plot, and for those with lack of knowledge about war torn Africa in the 60s it will be a great help. I like recognising the same characters in each book and the addition of one or two new ones. Great stuff!"
3,Is Griffin dead?,"While most of this book was enertaining, the last 100 pages or so were horrendous. Many years had passed between the last installment in this series and this book, so remebering the charachters certainly detracted from enjoyment. Griffin also has tried to bring in too many of his previous charachters into the story.The use of orders, messages, etc. has always been an effective tool for Griffin to move his books along. However, he choses to write the last 100 pages in this format. Occasional use of this format doesn't detract from the reading, however constant use of this method destroys a book. His use of this method has led me to question who actually finished this book?To new readers of Griffin: His works have always been enjoyable. Of particular note is the Badge of Honor Series and this one. Start from the beginning and enjoy. Grffin's better days as a writer may be behind him."
1,Special Ops,What a waste of money. This book must have be assembled from rejected material on some of Griffin's other books. I've read all of his military & CIA/OSS books and enjoyed them all but Special Ops was a huge disappointment.
1,Special Ops,"For the first time I found a Griffin novel deeply disappointing.I found Special Ops to be dull. The last pages of the book were almost exclusively ""block orders"" that Griffith used sparingly and effectively in previous novels. This time they were used apparently because he was to lazy to write any dialogue. Characters were poorly developed: some major characters of past novels played only cameo roles and could heve been eliminated. Dull!"
2,Hopefully the series ends here....,"I think what I found most annoying about this book was the beginning where large chunks of the previous two novels (The New Breed & The Aviators) were either torn intact or badly rewritten and stuffed into this novel to flesh it out. Granted it's been a long time since a Brotherhood of War novel has been released and it's ok to remind the reader of what has come to pass, but this was nearly insulting and if you've read either of the previous novels recently it's just downright boring to read them AGAIN here.Mr. Griffin, if you must write another BoW novel, lets hear the story of Craig Lowell's adventures in Vietnam, they're hinted at in several places and sound exciting. Anything would be better than Special Ops."
4,Special Ops,"I look forward egerly for each of Griffin's books. It has been too long a dry spell since the last one in the Brotherhood of War, Badge of of Honor or the The Corps series of books. Now that he has brought closure to the Brotherhood series we have his other two popular series to conclude. Special Ops is typical Griffin and is a book that you don't want to start a reading session with if you only have a short time to spend with it. It is a book that you can pass a long cold winter's day or evening with and feel you have not wasted the time. The happy ending for Jack Portet and Marjorie was a nice touch and makes the book more than just a military novel."
2,Read BEFORE you buy,"I purchased a ""Wecome Aboard"" donut to replace lthe one by our pool. I ""must"" have missed reading the size ( if there was one) before buying. When it arrived, WOW! Iwas less than 1/2 the size of my old one and would only look good by a childs wading pool. Again, read before you buy."
4,over door swing arm,It's a very handy hanger that helps extend your closet space but be aware that too much weight will cause it to bend. So don't overload.
1,item needs to be described properly,the width cant be adjusted! it wont fit all door sizes! this was one of the most deceiving products sold on amazom!
1,straight to the garbage bin,"I use to own one of those things a while ago - very steady, held many jeans, looked neat, etc. This one is sooo flimsy, a cheap copy - I was so disappointed when I got it that I threw it away."
2,doesn't stay up on the door,"I have had products similar to this and have never had a problem before. For some reason, after handing 5 or 6 items on this the whole thing falls off the door! I am going to see if I can figure out why and ""fix the problem"""
1,Zero Rating,"I guess 1 is the official lowest rating, but this thing gets zero with me - it bent right away with only 4 lightweight sweaters and 3 shirts on it! Unbelievable, no way would it have held the entire length of hangers even if all were shirts."
2,Over Door Swing arm,This did not work for me. It would not fit over our door. The back part was very short and if it had gone on the door it would not have been very well supported for the clothing I wanted to put on it.
3,Only works on the outside of a door.,"There is a big square piece that overhangs on the back side of the bracket prevents this from being used on the inside of a door. That piece interferes with the door trim. Also, there are to bent metal tabs on the top that can scrape on the door trim if the gap between the trim and the top of your door are very narrow.It's stamped metal, not super fancy, and it's very light weight. The fact that I can't leave it up means it's going to live in a cabinet until it's needed, rather than on the back of my door where it's always ready. Not ideal."
2,"Slow, slower, slowest!","I've used PC Anywhere in all its iterations. As a professional software analyst, I used to require that all my clients purchase a copy.But not anymore. My biggest beef is that even when both the host and remote connections are high speed Internet, this product responds too slowly. When using this product, I can click with my mouse, go to the bathroom, get a second cup of coffee and pet my dog before the command will take effect.I much prefer using WebX or VPN as a tool of choice for remote support.On the plus side, remote support after hours, while slow, is relatively painless."
3,ok but slow,"I have been using PC Anywhere since version 9, versions 10 and 10.5 have given me no futher features or stablity. I find that connecting via a modem across the telephone lines that I can only get a connection speed of 28.8k even when using 56k modems. I also find that if you try to do too much at once, ie print and open up a document at the same time that you will lock up the host machine. Otherwise the programme is simple to set up and use. Most of the time it actually does work"
1,Never changes,"You would think that a product would improve with time -- but no, not pcAnywhere! It is, always has been, and probably always will be deeply flawed. I installed this product on two Windows 2003 Servers. On one of them, the host service kept failing whenever I tried to initiate a file transfer. On the other server, file transfers worked fine but the visual display was a distortion of black and white lines. It's amazing -- every single version I work with has some problem that keeps me from being able to move it into production. And version 10.5 is no exception. Save your money!"
2,Don't bother with PCAnywhere,"I'm not going to lie, PC Anywhere is certainly a good program, but you should know there are other programs out there. They will also provide you with remote access that is just as secure and feature-rich as PC Anywhere. The one I recommend is LogMeIn, because it not only is fast and secure, but it's also free."
1,nothing new...,"nothing exception interesting about the new version 10.5 from the version 10.I was able to use fast user switching in windows XP with pcanywhere 10.5 demo.. but this retail version just remove the FUS totally!And when i installed it in my windows 2000 server, it must have some conflicts with some software or something, becuase after i reboot it, it gave me a BSOD!"
5,Beautiful Music,"I love this CD! I speak very little Spanish, but it doesn't matter, the songs are wonderful, and the music is so easy to listen to. Marco Solis has a beautiful voice and I will probably buy another of his CD's."
5,Ay ay ay!,"If you can understand Spanish: load the album on your iPod, lay down on the couch with good headphones, get taken away into a sweet sad world, and be in tears by track 5.If you don't understand Spanish, I'm sure you'll still appreciate the sounds (and, if you're female and/or so inclined, the photos of Marco), and maybe you'll get inspired to learn some Spanish so you can enjoy the poeticism of the lyrics! ;-)"
5,MAGNIFICO!!!!,MARCO ANTONIO SOLIS ES REALMENTE UN MAESTRO. SU SENSIBILIDAD ES PURA TERNURA.....:_) PARECE QUE LE ESTA CANTANDO AL OIDO A UNA HHHHMMMMMMMMM I LOVE IT.
2,Nothing we really don't already know,"This book was below my expectations considering such a topic as intimate relationships and the such. It's a decent read, if it were simplified. It seems the author tries to outdo himself with his penmenship. What it boils down to is that love is power, but then again, everything centers around power and some of the things that might perk your interest is stuff we really already know anyway."
1,Completely Wrong!,"We received an item that was not the item pictured or described, and we were very disappointed."
5,Easy Rider,As with most MALES initially I tried to install the snow-cables without directions but - - - looking at the CARD it took me only about seven minutes to install BOTH cables and only one minute to remove them - - - CAUTION - -TOP speed is less than 30 mph
3,Easy installation but chain stretched??!!!??,"I studied the installation on our drive into ""snow country"". I wanted to be prepared and ready when it was time to stop and put the chains on our tires. We actually made it to our lodge, so I was in a good location with no stress or hurry. However, it was cold and the snow was falling heavy. Since I had read the guide, I knew just what to do and it was relatively easy. HOWEVER, My husband had to drive to the store the next day and made sure to stay WELL under the maximum speed. We are quite certain the chains were installed correctly, but they STRETCHED on one tire and kept popping off. It caused and incredibly inconvience and we even rotated it to another tire, etc. This one chain kept popping off. Luckily we found it everytime, but WHAT A PAIN AND UNRELIABLE . . . AND YES, IT CAUSED US TO LOSE TRACTION AND GET STUCK. :((("
1,Didn't do squat for me,"I've used regular chains off and on for 45 years, so they are not new to me. I decided to try the cable style on my 1/2ton Ford van and they were horrible. In their first use, they wouldn't stay on the tire, flipping off almost immediately, with minimum tire spin. Three hours of screwing around with them, repairing them repeatedly (the diagonal cable) and finally I was able to make it up my modest incline of a driveway. This all occurred in about 6"" of snow on a dirt road and drive. The next day I was able to get out (amazingly the cables stayed on for the 1/4 mile drive to pavement) and I immediately went to the local parts house and bought old fashioned ladder style chains. The cable style might work for some, but they were terrible for me. They are pretty easy to put on and take off, I'll give them credit for that."
2,Over spec'd,"The ordering guidelines for these chains were very specific as to tire size. The list covered virtually every tire known to man along with the appropriate(individual) item number to order for that particular tire. The set that I received had a sticker that listed dozens of tires from 15-17 inch including floatation tires. This did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the fit. Sure enough, they are not the right size for my tires. The tensioner can not even take the slack out enough to clear the brake drum because of too much chain. These were obviously for a higher and/or wider tire, not the size listed when ordered. I'd return them, but since I didn't try them right away, the original packaging is long gone. Live and learn, I guess."
3,It works but you can get it cheaper from other places,"I have an icy and steep driveway so I am very happy I bought this. It is very easy to install and after a few practices I can install both of them in less than five mins. I bought my snow chains from pepboys in Albany, New York and it was only $89 and the price on Ebay motors is also cheaper than here."
2,Make sure they fit!,"I purchased the ZTL 751 cable chains for my suburban. Used the chains a couple of times and they worked well. Fit the tire nicely. I have since sold the suburban and purchased a Ford excursion with larger tires. The fit guide showed the new size tires are within the size specs for the ZTL 751 chains. Well, the chains will not fit. I contacted customer service and received no help. I did get an explanation about how tire manufacturers are allowed 4% variance to the tires and my tires just must be in the variance. Sorry, too bad. I was not offered anything in return to get new chains from SCC to fit the tires the ZTL 751 were supposed to fit. I purchased a new set from Les Schwab that say, and do fit perfectly."
5,They work,"I'm a rural carrier. I have driven through 100 miles, up and down the hills on the back roads, with 4 inches of snow on the roads with these on without a problem. Learn to put them on before it starts to get bad. I've gotten to where I can put on all four in 30 minutes. Just remember not to go too over 30 to 35 mph with them on. Otherwise you'll tear them, and your tires, up."
2,Not Durable,"When I first got this product, I thought it was great - these ""chains"" go on so much easier than the kind that you have to lay out and drive on to... I've got a pick-up truck, and have used these ""chains"" about 6-10 times. My low rating is due to the fact that one of the cables is about to break (about 2 or 3 strands of the cable are holding it together, but it's not safe to use). The problem seems to be that the cable on the front and back side-wall is crimped in to these rectangular junction points and I'm guessing that when they crimped mine, they damaged the cable, because the cable is breaking right at the crimp point. I've had them for more than a year (the warranty period) but I'm going to contact the company to see if they will stand behind their product..."
4,physical condition can hamper installation!,"I was stuck with the rear of my truck (F150, 8cyl., long bed, extended cab, 2005, Curtis snow plow on front) in the ditch. One front wheel touching drive way. Opened new set of chains and with quite a bit of exertion (I'm 75, with some disability) managed to get one chain on the available wheel. In 4 wheel drive I eased the truck out of the ditch, put the other front wheel chain on, where they remained for the remainder of the winter. With the particular type of chain there's no problem running short distances. With old style of chains, where one has to drive on them, I'd have stayed stuck. I will be ordering another set to put on the rear. Common sense tells me that I should have tried the chains on when I got them but I ignored my common sense!GalenPerkinsville, VT"
5,Snow chains,Good product easy to install. Easy to take off. Fit the tires nicely. Would recommend them for anyone with a 2 wheel drive Chevy Tahoe.
5,Perfect fit and easy installation!!!,"My wife bought these for me for Christmas. I have an F150 and a Pathfinder with oversized tires. These happen to fit BOTH vehicles. We were snowboarding in Big Bear and when we got back to the cars, I helped my friend put his chains on his car, which took about 35 minutes (We had to custom cut them). Then we put these on. They took about 2 minutes per tire and fit beautifully! They were wonderful to drive on, given the situation, and gave great traction, even in a high torque vehicle. They also were a breeze to take off. Terrific design!I do a lot of off-roading, both dry and snow, and i can't wait to use the heck out of these. I highly recommend them. And the price... Excellent for what you get!"
5,Great Tire Chains,"These chains work great, easy to install and grip so good on ice and snow in the High Country of Colorado..."
4,Worked Kinda Well...,"Just put these on the day after the Christmas storm (over 20"" in Brooklyn). These won't get you through snow much higher than your axles, but I was able to make it to work without issue in a 2WD Dakota Quad Cab. My one big problem: my rear passenger side chain got tossed. I'm guessing it happened after I was forced to drive into a large snowbank on that side. Even with just the one chain on, driving was 10x better than without it. In any case, I'll be ordering another set!"
2,Not as good as advertised,"I live at the bottom of a steep hill and bought a pair of these hoping that they would help me climb the hill in snowy conditions. In fact, quite the opposite occurred. Once the springs which coil around the ""Z"" links bit down through the snow and onto the pavement, they seemed to act like little roller skates on my tires. I was not able to climb the hill at all. I removed the chains and was immediately able to crawl up the hill with nothing but my all-season tires. These may work on flat surfaces, but i did not notice any increased traction for climbing - in fact they made things much worse. I think I'll go back to good old fashioned diamond-pattern chains.I do have to admit that these are extremely easy to put on. It only took me about 2 minutes per tire, and they give a nice tight fit. Perhaps they work well in most conditions, but certainly not on my hill."
2,Small and hard to read,"We bought two NZ maps before our driving vacation. This one was essentially useless- weak contrast made it hard to read, and it was smaller than the Rough Guide map. We bought it because it had a few city maps, but found that AA city maps are widely available free at NZ hotels. Get the Rough Guide map instead- cheaper and easy to read."
5,Excellent Knives,"I enjoy cooking quite a bit and use the Anolon Advanced Santoku knives in the 5-inch and 7-inch length extensively. My sweetie has smaller hands, though, and was having trouble wielding the larger knives and was delighted when I came across this 3.5-inch Anolon Advanced Santoku Knife while searching for something else. This knife set didn't come up when I searched for Anolon Advanced Santoku Knives. We enjoy using non-serrated knives and have found these knives to be VERY sharp upon arrival, hold their edge very well, well-balanced, and have a good, sturdy heft to them. We have the Anolon Advanced Santoku Knives, Steak Knives, the Paring Knife that came with this set, and the serrated Bread Knife. All are outstanding quality and their low price for such quality is an added bonus."
1,Disappointed,Beware! This CD is a compilation of cheap imitators playing songs we thought were performed by the original artists. I'll remember not to buy any of Drew's products in the future.
2,A bunch of biographies!,"OK, I was expecting to read another ""the millionaire next door"" and I didn't find any trace of it: no guidelines, no universal rules, nothing. I guess the biographies are interesting in themselves but the classification of this book in the personal finance category is completely off, as it leads you to expect teachings whereas you only get examples taken from people's lives with no theory behind it...."
1,bad research,"How could anyone call DEL HEDGEPATH a success when all he is doing is ripping off poor college kids by renting out delapidated, unlivable houses to people can't afford otherwise. Better research should be done not to martyr a con artist!"
1,rags to riches motivating stories of how ordinary peopl,"I was disappointed by the book. Luckily I only got it from the library. IF YOU HAVE NO COMMON SENSE THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. If you don't know that paying off your mortgage and then saving the money the bank would have gotten is a good idea, then read this book. Please don't waste the money. GO to the library."
2,How to cheat and get ahead,"In the Introduction the authors state ""their stories can serve as an inspiration to all of us.""Then later they talk about how David Geffen lied to his employer about being a college grad and then arrived early each day to go through the mail to find letter from college. When it arrive he steamed it open, obtained a new letterhead and wrote his own letter verifying he was a graduate. Great lesson on how to get ahead. Just what I want my children to learn."
5,Rags to Riches gave me valuable insights and courage,"I could not put this book down. I am a successful businessperson, but the tips I got after reading about each individual's triumphs encouraged me to trust my instincts. In the few short weeks since discovering this handy guide, I have been able to see new possibilities."
1,The English Teacher,"I took four of his courses. English 101 was pretty good. 102 was great. 131 and 132 [were bad]. Read the book, ..."
3,Adapter Kit Not Needed,"After installing the new Waste King Legend 2600 garbage disposer unit it was determined that the kit was not needed. The new disposer used the same installation equipment as the Badger it replaced and, because my sink is stainless steel, no special gasket or plumber's putty was required."
1,Not needed,"This adapter set isn't needed if you remove any and all previous mounting materials from your sink. That wasn't clear from the product listings, so we ordered it. This gave us a chance to experience and applaud Amazon's return process. It's quick, simple, and efficient."
2,Too hard to use,"The Waste King Adapter proved too hard to use. It was literally easier to strip off the old Insinkerator hardware and install the new Waste King hardware. Thankfully, Amazon gave me a refund."
3,It wan;t needed-so I sent it back to Amazon,"Reviews of the installation materials supplied by Amazon and Waste King and several reviewers led me to believe this adapter kit would be helpful in installing a new Waste King garbage disposer. When I opened the garbage disposer package, I could see that I had everything I needed to install the new device so I arranged to send back the Waste King 3101 ISE Adapter Kit and got a refund. I had to pay for shipping so my mistake only cost me some of my time and about $5 in shipping cost."
3,didnt work,"good quality product but didn't adapt my waste king to the in-sink-erator sink fitting, as a result of trying to use it the lip of my disposer broke off and i had to buy a new disposal unit"
2,i didn't need this attachment to install my disposal,i thought i needed this to install my disposal but it was unnecessary and the instructions were vague. i installed my disposal with what came with it.
3,Didnt need :(,We ordered this adapter with our new 1hp Waste King because of reviews... It came with the 3 bolt on the disposal so we didnt need the adapter!!! Better safe then sorry I guess. We returned it for a refund!
3,didn't need for installation of the new garbage disposal,"It was ""hinted"" that I might need this for the installation of the Waste King garbage disposal. It was not needed as the Waste King came with everything needed to be completely installed."
5,Makes install so much easier,Using the adapter you don't have to worry about taking out the old connection or using putty etc. It makes it so anyone can install the new system.
3,"Good product, but not needed if you purchased the main unit",Not 100% needed if you installed the main unitWill keep as replacement for future use. To cheap to return.
3,Not usually needed,"Returned this because you really don't need it. If you Have trouble getting the old bracket out, it might be easier. but using the default screw in mount is really easier."
4,probably a good product,still don't know why I bought this adapter set. When I bought my disposal on line it said that several people bought this as well. Since I didn't know if I needed it or not and it was only a few bucks I went ahead and bought it. It is currenty on a shelf in my garage because I don't see any purpose for it. The disposal I bought came with it's own. It looks like it would be a good product if you need it but I didn't need it.
1,Not needed,"This adapter is not needed if you are installing a Waste King disposal into a normal stainless steel sink. In fact it is hard to imagine a sink, unless it were think granite, where you might need this adapter. Everything you need comes in the box with the disposal. The unit might be needed if you are installing the unit into an unusual sink that already has a three bolt fitting. I recently installed a Waste King 8000 into a stainless steel sink and aside from having to cut the plastic outlet pipe and purchase a longer dishwasher pipe had no problem.I ordered this adapter, just in case. Amazon will of course take it back, but I must pay the return shipping cost."
3,"Works great, but weak instructions","When I first got this, I struggled for about 45 minutes to figure out how it worked. Like one of the one-star raters I couldn't figure out how to make it fit to the old 3-bolt flange without falling through.The problem is the instructions: they are very detailed about fitting a rubber adapter to one end of the new hard plastic piece. But then they tell you to take the other rubber adapter and put it between the 3-bolt flange and the new plastic piece. What they DON't tell you is that you have to fit this other adapter over a small rib on the hard plastic piece - just like you had to do at the other end.A simple inspection of the pieces does not make this obvious. But once you do it, the now-expanded rubber piece fits very snugly against the old 3-bolt flange.It would also help if their instructions didn't look like they'd been printed with a 30-year-old copier that was low on toner."
1,You don't need this.,Don't purchase this kit for your Waste King disposal. You will not need it. The disposal has everything you need. You will only need this if you want keep the existing mount that came with the disposal that you want to replace this with. Why would you want to do that? Get rid of the old mount along with the broken garbage disposal. This Waste King includes everything you need. Don't buy this. You will be sorry when you do then you find out that the shipping you have to pay to return it costs just as much as this kit.
1,Disposal Info Wrong - Item not needed for Install of Disposer,The information on the Waste King Disposal page was wrong - I did NOT need this item or the Dishwasher Connector. Now I'm out an additional $18.00 for no good reason.
1,You just don't need this item,"I installed a Waste King 8000 and swapped out my existing Insinkerator Badger. There really isn't a need for this adapter. Changing out the connector collar was the least difficult thing I had to face in completing the installation. It wasn't the Waste King unit that was the problem. It was cutting my existing pipes to fit the larger Waste King 8000. All in all, it was a challenging install but, I'm very happy with my new disposal!Save you money you just don't save any time or effort by using this thing.BTW, this is the first time I've returned anything to Amazon. Wow was that EASY....nice job Amazon!!!"
1,crass upselling,When you buy a waste disposal this is not needed as you recommeded. Crass upselling. And charged me to return it.Beware recommendations
1,ITEM NEVER INSTALLED,This was a suggested product to add to a garbage disposal installation. ITEM WAS NOT NEEDED - NO WAY TO RATE THIS PRODUCT.
5,Even Julia Child would approve of this BOOK yum yum,Collecting cook books is one of my favorite hobbies. This book is right up there with Jacque Pippen and Julia Child.Chef Calfon blesses us with his secrects for High French Cuisine and shows that its not as difficult as you think to prepare these wonderful recipies nor are they out of ones budget to prepare a meal to empress the guests at that next dinner party. Tres Bien!!!
5,"Me consta, porque vivi tres años en Paris,","que las recetas de este libro SON LO MEJOR DE LA COCINA FRANCESA...El aroma de sus platillos, es el que respiras al pasar frente a cualquier Bistro de Montmartre!"
1,"Readers will be better off with the original, Dr. Howell.","If you're interested in the basis for the Food Enzyme Concept, you will be better off with the original, Dr. Edward Howell's book, ""Food Enzymes for Health and Longevity."" Santillo's book is an enthusiastic abstract of some of the highlights of Dr. Howell's work, but the details got a little scrambled in translation."
5,Stars that helped out by entertaining the troops...,"Great book about the Andrews Sisters, their work during the WWII years with the USO, and many of the other stars that participated in these shows to entertain the troops."
4,Great read,I have a entirely new / positive impression of some of Hollywood's finest and the incredible efforts they made to entertain our troops throughout the US and around the world during WWII
1,Good Grief and Useless,"This book has a subtitle about the ""laws of fermentation"" about which I teach and cook. Well, this little gem has nothing to do with how to make wines like they did in the Bible, it is a 90-some page, one man rant about the lies and the supposed twists that make wine OK in the Bible, but Mr. Patton as decided they meant ""juice"" and that wine is BAD. Urgh!I make rustic wines, as little modern chemical help as possible, I was looking for some old fermentation guidance. This is not it.AND it was so old the first time I opened it the binding came undone and every page fell out. So much for a return.I have purchased many books online, this is the only one I have been disappointed in."
2,nut driver,"I bought these because i had a set of craftman drivers ,with the colored handles. These are not as good as those. I would have gotten the Craftsman or klein set but i dont like the smaller handles, on the smaller drivers and no color on the handle. The Stanleys are not marked on the ends either."
3,footage of Anthony Kiedis at 2 yrs old!!!!,"This movie was a great movie for one reason, and one reason only, there is footage of Anthony Kiedis at age 2! Unfortunately, there wasn't much footage from the band members themselves, rather their friends and family members- Blackie Dammett. Overall, those of you who want to see anthony's gorgeous baby face, this is the movie for you. If you want to hear friends, family and teachers describe the members of your favorite band this is for you too."
5,Avery Economy View Binder,"These three inch capacity ring binders were purchased for a college student who needed front and side view, white binders for classes. The Avery Economy Reference View Binder filled the bill exactly, including price. With the free shipping for these binders and other student supplies purchased, I was happy with the quality, price and shipping. I did compare pricing with local office supply stores and found a huge savings with these 3 inch Avery binders."
2,Never Again,"Never again. I paid over $17.00 for two 3 inch binders. They arrived with ugly bar code stickers affixed to the spine with some sort of adhesive that NASA needs for the next space shuttle program. Painstaking careful removal, followed with applications of rubbing alcohol - and there is still a sticky residue on each spine. If I wanted this sort of binder I could have gone to Dollar General or Staples."
3,Cheap and holds everything,Like the binder but it doesn't close properly. have to force to close.other than that a great product for an affordable price.
5,Hell Ya!,this record is by far the best el-p this year. Brother Ali relley puts his ryhems where they should be in the ear of his listner. We need more MC.es like brother ali. / make love not war
5,Can Words Explain this Album,"I just finished listening to Shadows On The Sun about 5 minutes ago. I always saw Brother Ali in the record store, but never really bothered to chek him out. What a mistake. This album, simply put is a masterpiece. Brother Ali, masterfully spits over amazing, complex beats, produced by Atmosphere's Ant, that are guaranteed to get your head nodding. Ali, acts as a story teller on the LP, and we are his listeners. Definately cop this album, you won't regret it."
5,"Albino, really? Did he mention that? Oh, he did! Phew.","Unfrickenbelieveable! Best Album of 2003! He should be bought a sandwich. The guy can tell more stories than your aunt Stella. He is vivid, his lyrics are great, delivery is solid, beats are treats, All around great album, and an all around great guy. ""Room with a view"", my favorite track but they are all good, not one needs to be redone. Only track, that I sometimes skip, is ""Prince Charming"". He sounds nuts. I mean, sure that is the point, but after a hundred times of hearing his ridiculousness of being jealous, it makes me want to beat the crud out of anyone like that. I mean if people are offended by my saying that, then go buy the album, a beeper for your significant other, and a more comfortable sofa."
4,Get the Champion EP instead,"The beats here aren't as soul shaking as on The Undisputed Truth and many of the best rhymes can be found on the Champion Ep (with better beats behind them). Brother Ali is always amazing, but this seemed too austere to be like his other records (I believe Ant needs to answer for that). It doesn't have a track to get me hooked like ""Rain Water"" or ""Uncle Sam Goddamn."" It's still personal and his storytelling is deep, but it's not as strong as his work from a few years ago. Maybe he has less to stress him out and write about, which is good for the man, but not the storyteller.If you're new to BA, start with the other records I mentioned, if you already know the man's music get this to support an independent artist."
5,Perfect album,"Brother Ali is definately the no. 2 man at rhymesayers, second to only Slug. He's iller than Eyedea has more skill than Musab, and is just straight up talented. If you only buy 2 rhymesayers albums get this and Overcast! Also he outperformed everyone on the god loves ugley tour. Get this ish now..."
5,Near Perfect Album,"Rarely do you hear such a mix of emotional candidness, artistic vision, skill, and ego. He delves into extremely personal territory, his albinism, but it never comes off as whiny or overly sappy, there is a genuine strength to every word. He kicks those braggin' raps with force, and he does it with the sense of a real battle rapper, not falling into the trap of overly complex wordplay as many underground rappers do. It's straightforward and hard hitting. He paints visions of the streets that his window looks out to, a la Nas, with understanding and empathy. He flexes his storytelling skills. He doesn't sound out of place in any of these modes, thanks to his careful writing, and nuanced delivery. And he does this all accompanied by the best and most immediate sound compositions Ant has ever put together. A true underground classic."
1,I'm glad I didn't buy it,"See title.Still think it sucks mucho @$$A Slug he is not.That haiku sums up this good for nuthin LP, FO REAL!!!!!!!!Peace!!!!!!!!!"
2,ANT wasn't on his game,"man i was expecting beats like i heard on seven's travels but i recieved no such thing. there are barely any songs on this album that stick out to me, spend your money on atmosphere."
3,Wants to be Slug.,"This is a decent cd, but there is nothing incredibly special about it. The best thing about it is Ant. Lets be honest Brother Ali isnt very good. His voice gets annoying and at his shows he acts too black. I dunno. I would sugest just listening to Atmosphere if you like Brother Ali at all."
5,Excellent album,For a relatively unknown name in the business Brother Ali has a powerful sound and a lot of strong beats to accompany his intelligent rhymes supplied by Ant of the well-known Minnesotta based Atmosphere. Ali incorporates a lot of spirituality/Islam into his lyrics and music (as suggested by the name) but the odd infusion works well and supplies some interesting sounds as in the track Victory.Forest Whitaker is a feel good track that you will want to listen to again and again. You might think I'm depressed as can be/but when I look in the mirror I see sexy ass me/if that's something you can't respect than that's peace/my life's better without you actually/to everyone out there who's a little different/I say 'damn a magazine' these is god's fingerprintsDorian is a story told through rhyme that many MCs would have a hard time delivering as clearly as Ali.All in all a near 5 star album that deserves a listen if not a purchase.
5,An emotional rollercoaster!,"Strap in and buckle up, you're in for a hell'uva ride!My friend turned me on to Atmosphere a few years ago, and I instantly grappled on. Brother Ali has been no different. His rhymes flow over the beats with einstein like intelligence. You won't find the constant shout-out's to his crew; (a..hem, G-unit) only carefully constructed rhymes and flows (""I flipped your eviction notice over wrote song on it""). The album is produced masterfully; the beats are catchy, dark, and unique. The opening track ""Room With A View"" gives you the dark view of his neighborhood, life, and culture. Six tracks later Ali has you dancing with funk on ""Blah Blah Blah"".In summary this album is a must have. I found myself fading out on the last few tracks, but other than that you'll be playing this one for months to come!"
5,first review is whack,"SOMEBODY SAID A WHITE NAS!!!???? first and foremost. Anybody who knows anything about brother ali knows that he is ""a righteous black man"" he is an african american muslim. He happens to be albino which is exactly what he talks about in his very heartfelt song ""Forest whitiker"" I just dont' understand how somebody who likes him so much could not understand anything about him. This is craziness. All of the songs are tite. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. But the comparisons to slug are garbage..he is nothing like slug. They're both great..but they are not similar at all..it is very possible to love ali and hate slug, or vice versa. These reviewers are nuts."
1,How Not to Read the Tarot,"This book by Abraham is very cute with the so called Key Word System, to a quicker understanding of the Tarot cards. However, it lacks substance, and the so called quick scheme does very little for the tarot student. It approximates, and does not really fully cover the meanings behind tarot cards, which are full of nuances and complexities. In order to fully understand the Tarot, one must really study it in its entirety, not use little cheat tricks to be fully illuminated. Its pretty much like trying to learn Algebra without first knowing how to multiply. This cannot be done, just as learning Abraham's system of Tarot reading is not going to make you efficient at understanding the cards. I say scheme, because it seems that's what these books are, geared toward the quick buck, quick explanation, and quick nothings!"
2,I was pleased with this purchase at first...,"I bought this after reviewing a number of books like it and reading the reviews.At first it seemed like a great book. After awhile, the keywords seemed to be too narrow for the true meaning of each card. For me, it took the life out of the readings - paring it down into a flat, mechanical routine.I recently picked up a copy of Tarot Plain and Simple - and I love it! In all fairness, it could be that I was using the wrong deck to begin with. After thumbing through the Robin Wood deck (illustrated in TPS) I found the symbolism much easier to interpret and the meanings seemed to jump out at me.I no longer use this book."
5,Exellent beginner to intermediate book.,"I began Tarot study/reading about a year ago, after becoming open minded to other spritural and self-help resourses, and refusing to prejudge the Tarot as ""the devils playing cards"" before finding out more about them first. This book really helped to open my eyes about Tarot, and has helped with learning and remembering card meanings. The author Sylvia Abraham has many years of experience in readings, and her book can be an excellent beginner's tool to understanding the cards. Illustrations of the Rider Waite deck are featured, but the text information can be used with most other decks(marseilles,renaissance,etc.). A great book!"
3,I cudda been a contender,"This book had some good characters except for the wild west character, whom I found to be a little far fetched. The Hero was far too soft and kind to his enemies to have been a captain in Her Majesties forces and his batman partner a little confused about directions to be a scout. The historical battle settings and descriptions were very good."
3,"Good Ending, Slow Beginnning","I found the central character to be a bit undeveloped and of minimal interest at the start. The major secondary character, 352 Jenkins, works well and in many cases is much more interested than Fonthill. I found all the secondary and minor characters well drawn and engaging, which helped Fonthill's characterization. The technique here seems to be a gradual, incremental revelation of Fonthill, which, to a degree works nicely. The historic events and places were of interest and well used, and at the end of the novel, the reaction of Fonthill to the battles made him much more interesting and complex, which then made some of his actions throughout the book more interesting. The problem here is one of structure, i.e., Fonthill needs to be complex at the beginning, so that the events he experiences color the entire book."
5,The Truth About Survivor,"As a fan of Survivor This book held my attention from page one. Other books pale in comparison, not telling the real story. Peter Lance not only gave us the truth about ""Survivor behind the scenes"" of this show, but made us feel as if we were there on the island with them. Any fan of this show knows there was just never enough of Rich, Colleen, Jenna, Mark Burnett, and the others. Where other books made you want more, this book told you what you wanted to know. Run don't walk, if you want the truth about Survivor."
2,A big disappointment!,"I love Survivor. But the books about Survivor on the market are not very good including this book. The author endlessly discusses his failed book deal with Richard. Then he endlessly discusses his failed deal to use Stacey's pictures in the book. All the way, he treats us to emails to and from Richard and Stacey. I found the book to be a hatchet job on producer Mark Burnett, Richard, Stacey, and Dirk. I guess an ""investigative reporter"" has to dish the dirt, but it makes for a sad read."
5,Survivor - What CBS doesn't want you to know!,"Peter Lance has done an amazing job on telling us the things nobody else would on hit TV ""Reality Game Show"" Survivor."
2,Very poorly written; editing nonexistent,"It is hard to judge the merits of a book in which typographical errors abound on each page. Worse, the author doesn't know the difference between ""elude"" and ""allude"", nor ""effect"" and ""affect."" His punctuation is bizarre. Sentence fragments abound.Clearly, this book was rushed to press to capitalize on Survivor's current popularity.If you are looking for new information on Survivor, or facts and the life history of Richard Hatch, look elsewhere. Throughout the book, the author repeatedly says ""more on that later"" or ""we'll get to that soon"" -- yet never does.I'm glad I borrowed this book from a friend and didn't pay my own cold hard cash for it."
2,"Style - 1, Content - 3","This would have been a mildly interesting book, but two things spoiled it for me: 1) careless editing (typos, grammar, errors of fact - getting Sue's last name wrong in one spot was the most glaring), and 2) tabloid-esque teasers and hyperbole (""wait-till-you-hear-what-shocking-thing-I'm-about-to-tell-you!"")It's hard to believe that Lance could have won a journalism prize if this is how he usually writes. The same material, had it been written in a more straight-forward and less hysterical manner, would have made for a much thinner, but more readable account of the behind-the-scenes insider dirt that I expected.As it is, the book appears to be an amateur production. I wasn't impressed."
4,"If you like Louis L'amour, you'll probably like this...","This was my grandpas book, and is copyrighted over 100 years ago. Thick pages, and damaged binding aside, this is a quick, run read! It goes well with those semi-cheesy western novels I have grown to love from Louis L'amour. Less cowboy and indian shootout action, and more of the roaming around in the mountains type of story telling.My mind continually visualized backpacking trips I have been on, especially when they were talking about streams, fishing, trails, rivers, etc. It was a fun read for sure."
3,Where do they get these pooches?,"This is a well organized daily/weekly calendar book that I buy every year to keep track of my chihuahua breeding program. I like the book and wouldn't do without it -- but where do they get their photos? Most of the dogs this year are rather homely to say the least. Hey, come to my house & I'll show you some really pretty chihuahuas! -- Annette @ HappyJoy Kennels"
4,Star wars - a long time ago,"I had a lot of trouble tracking this book down in the UK and ended purchasing from the states and paying the package as it worked out more cost effective.Have not read the entire volume yet, but thoroughly enjoyed the opening chapters covering the first star wars film and the subsequent adventures of han and chewie and how they lose the money they received for helping the rebels which is meant to pay jabba the hut......Great nostalgic 70's marvel art in great glossy paperback form. In no way a deep read but great if you've got an hour and you want to slip away into a different part of the galaxy and watch jedi knights with lightsabers or even giant bunnies with blasters!! ( the book / comic's takes you down very different story arcs to the film).If you enjoy marvel comics and you enjoyed the star wars films a must, if not you might find it all a bit silly."
4,"Archaic, but entertaining nonetheless","I enjoyed reading this book, although the information was a bit dated and a few of the techniques are difficult to implement. Ms. Fortune also happens to be trained in the Western Christian tradition, which is at varience with contemporary pagan beliefs. This is a classic work, and the anecdotes are great, but if you want more up-to-date methods, I'd recommend either ""Psychic Self-Defense"" by Robert Bruce, or ""Arcane Lore"" by Scribe 27."
2,A good beginning,This author does a good job of describing the damage that may be done to suggestible individuals - affirming that an interest in the occult may leave one open to negative influences. The many Christian based practices bothered me because they were intermingled with occult practices (Golden Dawn). I stubbornly hold the concept true Christians shouldn't be dabbling in the occult and true pagans shouldn't be invoking Christianity as alternative defense when troubled by domineering personalities or unscrupulous practitioners of magic. This book seems a little old fashioned today perhaps but is still a very good beginning.
4,"Simplistic...but facinating, complete and effective.","Dion Fortune covers all the bases in this book, but not quite in the way that I was expecting. Nine-tenths of the book explains and catagorizes different types of psychic attacks. These explainations are accompanied by facinating antecdotes...these alone make the book a good read. However when it came down to the methods of defense, I found them to be little more than common sense...although what is more effective than common sense? For the newcomer to occultism, as well as the old-pro, the techniques described are easy and nearly fool-proof. I guess I was just expecting complicated ancient secrets, and what I got was a complete basic-strategy manual. Don't get me wrong though...this book is a must have!"
5,Great and it Works!,"Amazing! Teaches how to protect yourself from people that use the occult to harm others, take advantage by using Black Magic. Also describes how certain people can drain your energy, make you unhealthy by conscious practice, on purpose and unconsciously without knowing it or controlled through another influence. Variety of different types of attack and ways to protect, defend yourself. I worked for people similar to Dions boss. Read the book and decided to break free before more harm was done. The energy, aura strengthening and other techniques helped protect me. My boss actually backed off when she felt the energy one day when coming to my room to request something. She quickly walked away and I never found out what she wanted. I also like her other books, including The Secrets Of Dr. Tavener"
3,Book on Psychic Attack,"Dion Fortune's ""Psychic Self-Defense"" is an interesting and sometimes useful material on psychic attacks but I don't put too much stock in some of her interpretations plus there was a little to no practical discussion for protection from the attacks. Indeed, there are occult influences scattered throughout this book, but still it was a worthy read, from my historical perspective, of its time. I found it to be a sober and informative examination of the phenomena, especially a section where she was talking about non-human or soulless individuals (as she could very well be describing a psychopath).All in all, it's an ""okay"" book on the subject but a classic. If one would want to indulge more into this subject, I would recommendUnholy Hungers: Encountering the Psychic Vampire in Ourselves & Othersfor more modern study of certain ""psychic attacks."""
2,Fanciful ideals,"Many of the ideas presented in this book, border on common sense. While others are simply out dated. If you are looking for spiritual methods of protection, you would be better off learning fromThe Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah (Timeless Gnostic Wisdom) (Timeless Gnostic Wisdom)orModern Magick: Eleven Lessons in the High Magickal Arts (Llewellyn's High Magick)."
4,The book is old (1927) but still bangs,"I enjoyed the book greatly regardless of its age. The information is still very much valid today. Ms. Fortune has some ignorant views concerning eastern religions, wicca and some ethnic groups of people, however if you can look past her early 1900 attitudes you will gain excellent information regarding the nature of psychic attacks."
3,A bit too dry...,"Well, what can I say? Dion Fortune's book are mostly dry anyways. After reading 4 chapters, I started to have a headache. The materials are a bit heavy. I can't say much though, but after scanning several chapters, I didn't find anything of much practical use. If you want to know about Psychic Self Defense - read Practical Psychic Self Defense by Robert Bruce. He summarized everything you need to know.Oh, and his book is not dry at all."
1,"Dated, biased, and stereotyped","Since the book was written in 1930, I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the stereotypes and inaccurate statements. Her views and statements about witches, psychic vampires, and magic come from a detached viewpoint, not from someone with an understanding of this phenonmenon. I put it down after the first few chapters, when I found a third series of stereotypical statements with no basis in fact. If you want more updated and accurate information on magic, or psychic protection, look elsewhere."
1,"OK, is she serious? Vampires and Werewolves....","Hardly know what to say. She actually believes in actual bloodsucking vampires who attack people! Dracula, move over! Bring on the garlic and sharpen my stake, and I better get a cross! What a load of you know what!And how about her little tale of ""The Berberlangs Of The Phillippines."" I have to admit that I laughed out loud when I read that one!It is kind of hard to take anything she says seriously, even though her advice about how to protect yourself does seem good!So all in all, a mixed bag, more negative than positive! This will probably one of the very few times in my life when I will do the unthinkable, throw a book away! Books are Sacred Objects to me so for me to do that is pretty much unheard of!And by the way, I am a Neo-Pagan Witch and as a Witch I would like to say that actual Witchcraft and superstition do not mix!"
1,Ignorance lets this book down heavily,"you cannot indirectly blame other cultures for the evils of the world, ignorance is a far greater foe. I pity the Author for an otherwise well informed book, she has let herself down in her lack of education of other cultures and ignorance. when writing a book research is important, and so is education, that is the ability to understand what you have researched.In a world often rife in racism and persecution, another coal in the fire. Clearly the Author does not have sufficient knowledge of Wicca or eastern religions, which in 2007 is abismal. may your soul have peace Dion."
1,Not very useful,"Lets say you are sleeping on the train tracks and the train is comming. This book would not teach you how to move. It will tell you what the author thinks of the colour of trains, how rude the conductors can be and other things that might be of entertaining value during afternoon tea with a friend. But not so useful in your current situation. Get a book that says: ""Do not sleep on the tracks, but beside them if you must. If you sense vibrations and hear a loud honking, get up fast and move to the side of the track. Trains are good if you do not sleep in front of them"". This book will might satisfy your sense of drama but it contains nothing of practical value."
2,Not the glasses pictured...,"The lenses aren't bad, but the design is different. Has the high nose if you like that as in the picture. But the temple and the earpiece are not as pictured. They are just straight plastic.In addition, these are supposed to be a brand name! They are supposed to be ""Able Vision"", but nowhere on the glasses or tags does it say anything other than ""China"".They do fit though and they are spring hinged and the plastic seems flexible. I have no idea if they are ""carbon"" unless China is another word for carbon. They are, however, flexible, so I think they may last longer than the cheap Walmart glasses.I just don't like getting something that doesn't look like the picture. No brand name. No carbon. No adjustable ear piece. Gives me no confidence anyone is getting the same glasses as pictured or even the same glasses shipped last week."
4,seeing better,These glasses are very well made and are just right for my reading needs. I have used over the counter glasses for a couple of years and these are the best I have found yet. But still looking!
4,An excellent swing compilation.,This is a great compilation. It's over an hour of swing classics and neo-swing tracks. It's a re-record but still sounds great and is a great buy for the $$. I like the mix of songs and you can even get the American Band-stand theme on this which is hard to find.
5,Must Have Study Skills DVD,"I can't believe this product finally made it to DVD with a workbook. I experienced this workshop 9 years ago and still use some of the skills I learned. It is presented in an extremely entertaining format with practical strategies for not only school, but also for life. I learned about self worth, motivation, note taking, test taking, learning styles and more. I am now a mom and I can't wait for my kids to watch this DVD! Thank you Study Smarts!Study Smarts GraduateKristi McCarterStudy Smarts - Study Skills for Grades 5-8"
1,"I hate to write a one-star review, but...","...the sound quality is just terrible. It's barely listenable. I don't usually have a problem with sound, just as long as it's not bad. I mean, despite it's low price, it's still awful. And as much as I love Billie Holiday, this CD does not do her any justice whatsoever.This was just a cash cow to make money for Madacy. My advice: avoid this and pick up '20th Century Masters.' Her voice is great, and the sound quality is just superb. But stay far, far away from this one.Not recommended."
1,Spend a little more money and get something good.,"I bought this 4-slice toaster in a brick-and-mortar store and just after three months, the right toaster unit is stuck on 'bagel'. Which means it only toasts *one* side of my toast. It's not the switch that is stuck or anything, which could be fixed easily, its like the wires just died on the other side. I thought that was a horrible way to toast bagels anyway (though I think thats how its done with most toasters). It makes it not very crisp, and as you can imagine, makes disgusting regular toast that falls apart when you attempt to butter it. Also, it doesn't toast as much as completely dry out the piece of bread making it like a cracker. The booster feature thats supposed to raise your toast out of the slots enough to grab is is a joke. I have to dig around with a knife to get the toast out anyway.What is up with this? My $10 sunbeam (single) toaster that died after six months made better toast."
2,Black & Decker 4-slice toaster,"I'm not very impressed with the Black & Decker 4-slice toaster.The lever on one side has to be pushed down three or four times before it will stay down. The other side works OK.The toaster is quite slow.The ""push up"" feature raises the toast less than an inch, so I still have to ""fish"" for some slices of bread."
1,The most I've paid for the worst toaster I've ever had,"Got this as a gift for the family a year or two ago. Kept it clean, used it gently (only adults used this toaster, no kids). Had problems with the levers staying down and with trying to get anything out of it since they wouldn't come up very far either. But it worked fine. Yesterday, one side burnt out, today the other-strong burnt chemical smell. Kept fairly clean, never burned anything in it. VERY disappointed. Have owned MUCH cheaper toasters that worked for decades. DO NOT BUY"
1,"Spend a little more, get a better toaster!!!",Cheaply made. You have to pull the handle up to get the bread/bagel out. Horrible. Just horrible.
1,Garbage- and that's where it's going!,terrible - junk- doesn't work - cant' believe a product could be made so poorly.
4,Simply Hilarious!,"Slums of Beverly Hills is one of the funnier movies about coming of age that I have seen. Natasha Lyonne has all the spunky tomboy qualities you would expect in a young woman growing up in a household (so to speak) with all males. Marisa Tomei is hilarious as her strung-out cousin. I don't believe that the youngest boy had a crush on the older, as a previous review said. He just looked up to him. Their nomadic lifestyle makes them quirky. The funniest scenes are the infamous vibrator one and the one with Uncle Mickey. It's a coming of age story mixed with wit and sexual experimentation."
4,Slums is a great place to be,"Slums of Beverly Hills is one of the most original movies I have seen in a while. The performances are terrific, the comedy is quirky fun, and the laughs come fast and sharp. A very original screenplay provides the story of a Vivian, a girl who is growing up in a family of nomads, and who is discovering her sexuality. The most memorable scene comes from the famous ""vibrator dance"", which seems like a sick joke that would fail on all levels. However, it doesn't! This scene plays like a bonding between the 2 girls, and never once goes over the top, retaining a funny and sentimental joy that is played out with lots of laughs. 4 stars instead of 5 due to a plot twist involving Alan Arkin and Marisa Tomie, something that seems unnecessary to me in terms of story."
3,50/50,"This movie has some hilarious moments, but it was excrutiating to sit thhrough some of the long drawn out white-trash dialog. I understand the context of the white-trash theme being necessary to complete the humor, but it should have been more campy and less of a painful documentary. I have friends and family who lived like that, I didn't see anything charming about it. Only watch it if you don't have anyhting better to do."
2,Mostly pointless,"Mostly a waste of time, with some amusing moments, especially when Tomei and Lyonne dance with a vibrator. But the real question is why Tamara Jenkins thought that anyone would care about her life story . . . ."
2,Not that good ...,Well it was actually a totally weird movie and ... uhm ... yea in a way it's like in the same style of The Big Lebowski for example ... either you love it or hate it ... I hated it ... BUT the last half an hour or so was actually quite entertaining! Wait to buy it untill it only cost 5-10 $
1,Who Cares?,The people who gave this movie more than one star must have a different sense of humor than I do. I thought this movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.
1,Lame,"There are talented actors wasted here on a lame script. Lame because it has nothing to say and even less to make one laugh. Sure there are laughs to be had, but for the most part it's just plain, poor taste masquerading as something in your face clever. If attendance is anything to judge by theatergoers gave this one a miss. It opened in August 1988, at 540 theatres and grossed so far $5m (so there won't be a sequel!)"
4,"wonderful, hilarious, and very sad","This is the best kind of indie film. THe characters are realistic and vivid, way outside of the junky stereotypes that come out of hollywood.The family is a complete mess, barely managing to avoid homelessness. THe father runs a restaurant, but can't handle money. He struggles to provide for his many children, who are adolescents in a dangerous phase of rebelliousness and increasing awareness. Arkin is painfully believable, warm, sympathetic and submits to the insults of his successful older brother who subsidizes him. You also empathize with the kids, particularly the smart, sensitive oldest daughter who is discovering her sexuality and recognizing the meaning of love, but also getting involved in petty crime with her drig dealer boyfriend. Tomei, the wayward cousin, is hilariously subtle and pathetic, avoiding her strident father and willingly participating in her uncle's scam.REcommended with enthusiasm."
5,What a great satirical look at adolescence!<<~~(Did I spell,"A hilariously-crafted movie! This is a great, semi-romantic look at poor, insane suburban life in the 70s--Natasha Lyonne and Marisa Tomei are splendid! Kevin Corrigan and Alan Arkin are also amusing!I will update my evaluation with more detail at another time!"
3,strange,"oddly quirky. Just when your about borde with the movie something happens to grabb your attetion, and when that wears down something else happens to grabb it again. luckly before this cycle gets old the movie ends, but it leaves you with the never answered question....HUH ???"
2,Odd,"This is kind of a strange coming of age story. There's no real point to it, not much of a storyline. Just day to day scenes in the life of the main character. Natasha Lyonne is a pretty good actress, she was interesting to watch. But I didn't find the movie that amusing. Alot more could have been done to make the film funny and to connect with the audience. This film was a bit of a miss.There is a very brief cameo with Mena Suvari as a neighborhood girl."
3,"Arkin, Tomei, Lyonne, Reiner... you can't go wrong.","I liked the fact that this movie, although laced with sexual themes and R-rated humor, is ultimately about a father who loves his kids and kids who love their father. And even the scenes of ribald humor and sexuality are mostly character-driven and kind of sweet. Well acted, funny, and quirky, ""Slums of Beverly Hills"" is a great little movie to discover on DVD."
3,"Surviving one's own family (in the 1970's in Beverly Hills, no less)","Natasha Lyonne delivers a superb performance as a teenager developing into a woman who must suffer the injustice of living with her own family. Sure, some of the humor is a little juvenile, but this isn't supposed to be award-winning drama, just some fun screwball comedy. There are some unforgettable scenes of silliness in a dysfunctional family. If black comedies are your thing, give this one a shot."
4,DVD,"I was very happy with the product & fast shipping. The packaging needs to be improved, plastic bag type isn't enough protection. My DVD arrived with a hole into the DVD holder & the DVD was off it's post & sliding around. It doesn't appear to be damaged, but easily could have been."
2,Movie: D+ DVD: C,Slums of Beverly Hills D+/C 2.1.00 1.85:1/2.0First Viewing Non-anamorphicDumb story and bad acting.
5,Royal DS3 Postal Scale Review,The scale is easy to use. Putting the postage chart under the plastic on top of scale means I don't have to hunt for the chart.
3,Disappointed,The only reason I choose this scale was because I wanted a scale with rate chart on it. BUT this scale does not come with one. I should have read the other reviews before placing this order.
5,Accurate for 4 years,"I bought this scale at WalMart over four years ago. It was affordable and weighed accurately the whole time I've had it. The 9V battery is still working. My only reason for needing a new scale is that many of my packages weigh more than three pounds. When I get a new scale, I will keep this one for kitchen use. Great product!"
1,Don't Purchase,Royal's scales are junk. Mine didn't work out of the box. Please check other Royal scale reviews as well.
3,Disappointed.,"Most of the reviews make this a good reference book, not a translation you'd want to use more personally. I doubt it will replace Yampolsky's translation. For my money, I prefer Cleary's translation of the later verison of the Sutra. Cleary's translation is much cleaner and easier to read.I think fan's of Red Pine will, like me, find it disappointing, mostly because the notes, in this case, make it rather confusing. Red Pine has made this approach work seamlessly, elsewhere, but not here. Still, I look forward to his Lanka, after all, this is the guy who gave us Han Shan and for that I'll be forever grateful! Let us not forget his Bodhidharma and Diamond, either!"
5,"Readable, Insightful Guide to a Critical Chinese Zen Text","As with Red Pine's other translations, Hui-neng's Platform Sutra is a jewel, perfect for someone approaching the Sixth Patriarch for the first time or for a scholar interested in the nuances of the various languages, manuscripts, and histories at play. Read it with your copy of Red Pine's Diamond Sutra nearby, and you'll really make this lively text sing. Can't recommend it enough."
3,Must brush very hard,Both my daughters didn't like these toothbrushes since they reported that they had to press very hard against there teeth to get it to play. It seems like a great idea and I hope they can come out a new version some day to correct this.
2,"nice picture, but broken","I reviewed this monitor when I first got it and gave it 5 stars. But recently the monitor crapped out. I've only had it for about 4 months. It doesn't turn on, the status light just clicks on and off and won't power on. NEC's warranty states that it will replace your monitor with new or refurbished equipment, so low and behold they told me that they're going to replace my monitor with a refurbished model. Kinda sux. Looks great whenever the monitor actually works."
1,dont waste your money,"fortunatly, i picked this up at TJ Maxx on clearance for 70 cents. Its nice to look at for that price, but I never would have paid amazon price for it."
3,Missing Ingredient(s)?,"It's a small book, with a nice overview of a variety of steamed items: vegies, seafood, chicken & meat, rice, & deserts. The first recipe (steamed pork buns) that I tried had a very dry dough, calling for only 1 TB of peanut oil and 1/4 tsp of sesame oil to 2 and 1/2 cups flour. Looking online, I found comparable recipes that called for the addition of water. I improvised and produced some relatively palatable buns that made for great doggie snacks! That being said, the grilled pork filling was fabulous!"
5,finger paints,"It was so nice to hear this guys voice again. Dick Summer used to grace late-night Boston radio back when radio had grace.His sensual and hypnotic talkes are wonderful little windows giving deep and warm views into our inner lives.These are really enjoyable, brief mental vacations. Quiet Hands is almost like finger painting for your heart and soul."
1,Perv with a tape recorder,"This CD is disgusting. This is nothing but an old man talking about his hands touching you all over in all places. Seriously - this will make you feel filthy!You can check the reviews below. If you click on the reviewer's name, you will see that they have only rated one thing. This guy obviously is logging in with a couple of different user names and giving himself the good ratings.I am not kidding. This cd comes with a homemade printed cover on cheap printer paper and the ink smears if wet. The cd is a simple CD-R that he obviously burned himself.This is the worst thing I have ever bought off Amazon and I am looking to see if I can return it now.If you are looking for a great meditation CD, check out Deepak Chopra's Soul of Healing."
3,It is ok.,Overall it does what it is suppose to. It is a target. Little smaller than I would have liked and I had an issue determining size when I ordered it. Ended up giving them to a fiend. Agan not bad but about the size of a hardback book if it was square.
5,Benchstones,"Another quality Spyderco product. Made from the same material found on the Sharpmaker rods, these stones allow more surface area for those the prefer to sharpen free hand."
2,Sean Patrick Flanery was the only actor in this!,"Sean P was the reason I rented this movie and surprise, surprise, he was the only one who actually acted and believably. The villian was annoying as hades and the FBI agent girl he fell for even more annoying. I really wouldn't recommend this movie unless youre a diehard SPF fan like me because it really tanked otherwise. The whole thing was pretty painful. Can I have my money back?"
2,one hour and eleven minutes,"That's how long I watched what I thought was a typical escapist B movie. I am a SPF fan and have watched most of his films for good or ill.I was enjoying this one until they had a character make the most dumb obvious rookie, stupid plot device possible. So for the last 20 minutes of the film I was not happy, especially when they had another character show up and be even dumber.So I give it a two star for Sean but it really should be a half star because of that last 20 minutes!!!!"
3,Decent Movie,"Deadly impact is a very average action movie. The plot and acting are average, not great. Decent movie to watch if nothing else is on ..."
1,Not worth buying,"I purchased this tape and book package to acquaint myself with Swedish for a trip we are taking. I wanted to listen to it during my work commute. The tape is hard to follow without the book, is not consistent with information in the book and moves ahead much too quickly for a beginner. Don't bother."
3,Good for vocabulary but not speaking,I started learning Swedish phrases through reading this book but come to find out when I had a real Swede tutor me later on that the pronunciation of the words and phrases in the book were mostly wrong. It is a good book to learn quick vocabulary and phrases but be sure to learn the correct pronunciation first!
3,A bit out of date but helpful,"This book/cassette is a bit dated, with too much use of the polite form and of more formal phrases. Nonetheless, a booklet plus a cassette is the best way to become familiar with a language on your own. The booklet covers most situations quite well. The cassette is difficult to follow without the book, so drivers beware!I've read reviews of this and other Swedish introductions that say the pronounciation is wrong. The truth is that pronouciation varies, depending where in Sweden you are. The Swedes don't volunteer this information, so it's easy to get confused. The good news is that it's difficult to pronouce something so horribly that you won't be understood, so just give it a try and learn!"
4,Swedish book,I bought the Swedish book a few months ago and it is very useful and has lots of words and phrases in it. I would deff reccommend to buy it if you want to learn Swedish.
5,5 stars for the game,"I'm rating this Item because i'm a fanatic of the game. Pesonaly I don't believe in stradegy guides, and I never held this book in my hand before. Beat the game on your own, resist the temptation of achievemnt with aid from a book. This game is worth your intellect. Don't mess with fate. Write your own logs for system shock."
3,karen,i read the book and following the simple instructions on what and when to eat. i have to say that it worked for me. i lost not only inches but pounds. i did not do the herbal additives..just the basic food combining steps lee put in her book. i found it to be easy to follow and did not have to buy any special food products..just simple..normal foods. this was the easiest and safest weight reduction i have tried. i am still on it and have gone a size and have worn skirts and slacks that were snug on me before are now loose and comfortable. thank you lee for your book. i also feel better and have alot of energy.
2,Read this first!,"I found this book full of information but vague on in what order, how much, and in what form to take these herbs."
1,Very amateurish movie,"Implausible, poor screenplay, dull, badly acted with virtually nothing going for it - avoid."
5,Crystal of the Dragons is amazing!,"I can't believe this book was written by a 12-year old! I bought it to read to my children and found myself reading ahead when they were in school! I would recommend Crystal of the Dragons to anyone, any age, who enjoys fast-moving, entertaining stories."
1,Great Band Bad DVD,What a shame that a great band with great licks and vocals comes out so bad in this DVD. The recording on this DVD is Aweful! Does injustice to great vocals. Until they come out with a professional recorded DVD don't buy it. My wife is a big big big fan of Aventura and not even she could watch the entire concert.Still a great band!
3,Old Switcherooo,"The Humidor overall seems pretty nice except that they sent me a CHEAP-O plastic cigar cutter rather than the quality STAINLESS STEEL cutter mentioned in the description and shown in the picture. I do like the humidor but when I get blidsided by something as simple as a switcheroo on the accessories, it leaves me feeling a little taken advantage of. Hopefully I can get a reply and they will correct things by sending me the correct cutter to make up for it."
4,Good Collection of Videos,"A video collection of some of DEVO's best songs. The videos appear dated - nostalgia versus early 80's video technology. Although, the songs have held up over the years very well. Spazz Attak, General Boy and Booji Boy add comic interludes. Larraine Newman's moments on the video are worth one viewing, and then countless fast-forwardings."
5,Rod Rooter Rules.....,"More than any other band of the video era, DEVO knew how to capitalize on the form. Their ""The Men Who Make The Music"" was shown on arthouse type cable shows before most peole even knew what music video was! I consider this to be an essentail part of any music vid library (AND PLEASE SOMEONE GET IT ON DVD!!!). Granted, the production values are way primitive compared to what followed in the decade, but the level of enthusiasm DEVO brought to the form has rarely been matched. And let us not forget the noteworthy perfomances of Larraine Newman and Spazz Attack.You get ""Whip It"" for the plastic energy domes, ""The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize"" for the potatoes playing the hippo's teeth, Barbi and Ken in their great big fight during ""Love Without Anger""...are you a Spud? Even if you aren't, you must have ""We're All Devo."""
3,not the best BUT THE SECOND BEST,"We're All Devo! is the second home video release by new wave band Devo. Released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1984, We're All Devo! is a collection of Devo music videos from 1976 to 1983.Like The Men Who Make the Music, We're All Devo! has a storyline to tie the videos together. In it, the character of Rod Rooter is reviewing Devo's music videos for Big Entertainment. Much to his chagrin, his daughter Donut Rooter (Laraine Newman) is a fan of the band. Donut discovers the videos after asking her father for money to get an abortion (though this is not explicitly stated).Track ListingJocko Homo(I Can't Get No) SatisfactionThe Day My Baby Gave Me A SurpriseGirl U WantFreedom Of ChoiceWhip ItThrough Being CoolBeautiful WorldLove Without AngerThat's GoodPeek-A-BooDr. DetroitA Worried Man (from the film Human Highway)"
3,Where's Mongoloid?,"Unfortunately, the tape does not include Bruce Connner's Mongoloid, the most durable of Devo's videos."
1,Casio 505 leather case 5,I like amazon for shopping alot. But the article pictured is not the same as the one I recieved. I was disappointed in what I recieved but it works for the camera. I agree with and found out too late about the last reviewer's comments. I would like to get the case pictured if I can find it.
5,Good Quality,Eventually even the best yo-yo string will break. I find it useful to have a few replacements around. I've always found Duncan products to be good quality and this string 5 pack is no exception.
4,Yoyo string,The string was very well priced and exactly what we needed. The item arrived sooner than we expected it as well.
4,They are acceptible yoyo stings,"I purchased these strings as replacements for my boys who seem to go through yo yo strings like crazy. Although their yo yo's are not Duncan's these strings seem to work just fine and are durable. I'm not sure they would be acceptible if you were a championship yo yo person, but for the average user, and for kids, they are just fine."
4,This came in handy,"My son learned how to yo-yo and takes one with him wherever he goes. The string was getting knotted up and dirty, so it was nice to have a replacement. It works much better with clean string. I'm still looking for something a little stronger, more resilient, but this fits the bill."
1,Bad Product,"Duncan really produced this product badly. They made the string unusable! when you apply the new string to the yoyo, there is supposed to be a loop there. In three of the 5 yoyo strings,the loops weren't there! So if you are looking for yoyo string, look for another product."
2,No happy,The book took too long and did not get its use. It was suppose to be for a class and never got it in time.
1,Would have given it no stars,"if possible. This is just a collection of mushy, sentimentalist garbage ... and if you are not Indian (or Bengali), please ... dont buy this thinking it will give you any accurate idea of Indian life and society at any given point in time. I have never understood why Tagore has such a reputation as a writer of novels and short stories ... stick to his music and art (which ARE terrific) and avoid this stuff at all costs."
4,Information is Power,"This is a very intelligently written book and a must read for any manager who wants to remain competitive in the New Economy. You can easily read it in one sitting. Why should you read it? To quote the authors, ""Companies are grappling with how to make the most of the Web, which replaces hierarchical information exchange with a dynamic, horizontal flow and enables fluid, team-based collaboration. You need to know how to leverage Knowledge."
1,Awful book,"There are no words to describe how much I hate this book. When you have to scour the internet for other books and lectures on EVERY SINGLE topic in a book then that is the definition of an awful book. As a previous reviewer said none of the exercise proofs are worked out and when they are in the lesson they are done in a very confusing manner. One theorems proof had five iff's in it. You literally have to have a Masters or a PHD in math to understand this ""great book for undergraduate math students""I read the chapters and look at the problems and then I immediately begin to scan Google books for other books on the same topic. The problem is that a lot of the notation in this book is exclusive to Mr. Baker so for those exercises you are left hung out to dry.If you like this book then you already know how to do everything in it. If you want to learn topology and/or proofs then buy another book. If your class requires this book, petition to have it changed."
5,Exellent yoga DVD,This is an excellent DVD for women of all ages. It is easy to follow but definitely makes a good workout. It seems like I am not working that hard when I am doing it but then afterwards I feel my muscles and know they have had a good workout. I team up either this DVD or a Pilates DVD with cardio work and have found that to be the best workout for me.
3,"Not bad, not great.","This is a collection of short stories set at various points during the run of Deep Space Nine; as with most collections of stories, some are better than others. None are really bad, although I could have done without the frame in which they are placed, as stories told by an aged Jake Sisko to a young fan of his writing; I thought that both the prologue and the afterward dealing with that frame were unnecessary and added nothing to the book, to say nothing of the fact that I doubt that Jake would have been privy to some of these stories. Certainly not the details, although one could assume that he made the details up. But if that were the case, then they aren't truly stories of what happened, but rather stories made up out of Jake's imagination. None of the stories are really great, either. Overall, I'd say that they range from mediocre to fairly good. Worth getting if you're a fan in need of a fix, but not anything for anybody not already a fan to bother with."
5,Good book on Prayer,Help understand why and who to prayer for things. It points out what we do wrong and correct them. This help me in my Intercessory Prayer classes
1,Not very good...,"I've read like a dozen guides to prayer and this guide isn't very good. Read, 'Bruce and Stan's pocket guide to Prayer."
3,Bucky Pillow Case,"There is nothing wrong per se with the cases, but they have zippers which are not shown in the photo. The cases are smaller than expected and difficult to zip. In all fairness to the seller, I did not contact them about this issue because I really needed the cases."
1,Amazon's details are wrong!,"This is a pretty good anime, but I had to 1-star it just because the details are wrong. Amazon lists this collection as having the English audio track, and it does not. This collection only contains Japanese audio with English subtitles.I made the mistake of purchasing the 3 individual DVD's and then also buying the collection thinking that it has additional audio tracks, but IT DOES NOT. They are both exactly the same.With that out of the way, this is an amazing price on a fairly good anime, so you should buy it right now. Just know what to expect before you order."
1,Awful is too kind,"Now, I'm not one to knock shows with fan-service, I own all of DearS after all. But if you're thinking about buying this show, just buy real porn. It has no plot what-so-ever, just a bunch of contrived situations where high school girls randomly flash their panties. It is so asinine, it hurts to watch."
1,Poorly manufactured RIP-OFF,"Wow, for $100 I would expect MUCH more.. the painted 'N' on the compass is missing half it's ink, as are the other painted pieces.. This poorly manufactured compass looks like it came out of a 4-year old's treat bag from a birthday party."
5,Best and still running,I bought mine in 2003..its now 2011..This is by far the best Monitor i have ever owen.The picture is still just as bright as the day i got it and i have never had any problems
3,Size matters? Not on this monitor...,"This monitor is huge and heavy. After I picked it up at the UPS post(I missed their delivery), I couldn't fit into my car. I had to dump the box on their site. After I set it up with my computer, disappointment settled in. The screen is big and bright but the objects on screen are not sharp enough. When I surf the net, usually the text seemed out of focus a little bit. I even downloaded their Naviset(?) utitlity software but no help. One good thing about this monitor though is that it offers USB hub which is a big plus, but it is only USB 1.0 so don't connect fast USB 2.0 devices to it."
5,Very Useful,"The book is full of explanations and advice, clearly written by a person who has long experience in the art and it makes it alive. All parts of the whole system oftaijiquan, such as basic exercises, form, pushing hands, free hands, weapons form and -fighting are vividly shown in their place and role. With examples from the classics and analysing experience of his own Scott M. Rodell clearly explains that the true essence of taijiquan can only known through its martial aspect."
5,Like opening a treasure chest.,"My first impression of Taiji Notebook For Martial Artists by Scott M. Rodell was similar to opening a treasure chest and discovering it full of jewels. I found myself reading it over and over and then taking a chapter each day to study and think about. I couldn't say one part stands out above another. The whole book is full of wisdom and it is a privilege to be given knowledge that has taken the author many years to learn.Scott's understanding of the Chinese language and culture is shared to our benefit as he explains concepts hidden within Chinese words. He makes it easy to understand. I found his attitudes changing my own and discovered there were decisions to be made if my taijiquan practice was to have the best chance of effectiveness.I recommend this book highly. It is not something that should be read once and put aside, but something to draw on time and time again."
5,Lelouch at his best,"Claude Lelouch gets back together with Jean-Paul Belmondo decades after Pierrot le Fou for what is to me the best of Lelouch and one of the best of Belmondo.Full disclosure: I was shopping Amazon for this movie after watching it again, to order it for a good American friend of mine and I am a little sad not to be able to find it with English subtitles. What a waste, as the US public deserves to be treated with this great, great movie."
4,Good Teaching Tool,"The book gave a solid, basic background and explaination about this investment. I like that it didn't try to be tricky or complicated. It just taught me what this thing was about,and then showed me how to go about trading in it. I like the part of the book about setting up for trading over the internet too, I thought it contained some nice insight.Bottom line from me, a traditional stock investor, it was a clear and helpful education."
1,Single Stock Futures,"Don't bother buying this book. It is so general and vague it's not worth the money. It rehashes tech analysis etc., that most would already know. It sheds no light into the world of SSF at all."
1,Book geared toward novice traders,"This book was obviously written for the novice trader. There doesn't appear to be anything in the book that one couldn't read in the NFA's publication, ""Security Futures: An Introduction to Their Uses and Risks"", which is available free of charge.With no clear date as to when Single Stock Futures will start trading, the shelf life of this book will be limited, especially given the current state of the stock market."
4,Just Queen,"Queen, it's just my favorite band Ever!so it's hard to me say something different than, ""This is an AWESOME DVD"" and actually it is, it's cool to see all the videos of two decades of this great band... as a fan like other i espected something different, this DVD is the Greatest Video Hits I and II in just one pack, something that there must be clear.Anyways, great sound, great image, if you don't have the others DVD's you will enjoy it, fully!"
4,Happy Music for One & All in PA & MI,"Very upbeat & most songs by the original artists that we baby boomers remember. Young children love the music & it ended the ""negative"" vibes @ the campsite this summer. :) Sure to bring smiles & dancing."
3,630 pages and about 100 are worth reading,"I read this book because it was a recommendation from a highly respected economic writer and I wish I had my time back. It's not that it's an bad book but the problem is that it's basically a collection of thoughts from the author without a interlinking connection. I did enjoy the author's writings about economics but that was only about 100 pages and this is a long book full of a mixture of unrelated articles. In summary, don't waste your time."
5,Great mailers for the money!,"I have been using these to mail out my products they have held up well. They aren't too thin, are easy to stuff, not see through at all, and the self stick is tamper proof which is a big plus. This is a much better price then you find on the big shipping supply sites or catalogs. These are really great mailers.Pros:PriceCompletely opaqueTamper proofEasy to stuffCons:None!"
1,"premise interesting, but book doesnt follow through","If you are looking for the detailed world building and the finely crafted characters of a good Cherryh book, this unfortunately is not the book. It takes an interesting premise and bogs down into a series of boring committee meetings. Potential conflicts are either ignored, or come to too easy of a resolution."
5,"Great, Urgent Record","I really dig this records. From front to back, I'm able to find soemthign that really gets me. I love the eclectic mix of song styles. Great live, too!"
1,DUD,"This card did not work in my system. Tried it with several games, but nada. Shipment was prompt, but card stinks. Manufacturer screwed this one up, not the distributer."
3,Memory Card,"Apparently when you need a memory card for a ps1 game, make sure it is psx or sony brand otherwise it wont work in a ps2"
1,Piece of junk - does not work,"I was attracted by the .99 cent price tag figuring what could go wrong, but even if I didn't have to pay shipping and handling .99 is still too much. Unless you're actually looking to buy a piece of rectangular plastic, in which case it's a good price. Because that's all it is."
2,i ordered the clear blue one ????,they sent me a ugly grey memory card??? buyer beware! but it does work
4,Ugh,"First off it is NOT the sellers fault! apparently if you have a PS2 slim, then some 3rd party PS1 memory cards might not work... we told the seller that it was not working, and he sent another one. So the seller is VERY nice!We have yet to try the new one, just make sure to do your research before you purchase this card so that way you don't make the seller look like the bad guy!!"
4,PS1 Memory Card Review,"Although it is not blue, like in the advertised picture, it's a memory card. It functions properly. Thumbs up. :-)"
1,Wrong memory card,I ordered a psx memory card. but got a ps2 one. Shipping was quite fast. But I'd go with a different buyer.
3,Memory Card,The card was in good condition but it turns out I no longer needed it. The product was in great condition and shipped very fast.
3,i'm content :!,plug it in.pop in a game. play. save. the endit works on both ps1 and ps2 consoles for ps1 game saves.
5,Great and inexpensive,"Well I only have 5 games for the ps1, and the price was excellent, I am very happy with my purchase"
1,This Memory Card Sucks,The card didn't work at all with any of my games. The card didn't work at all with any of my games.
2,Not enough information,"I bought this product thinking that it was compatible with my PS2, however it is not. Nowhere in the product information does it say this. I was disappointed."
1,please don't waste your money or time,this item sucks don't get all happy with theprice this damn card isn't even formatted for the PS1 at all it really sucks.just buy a card at your local game store or something
3,Floating globe,"The globe works as advertised.A negative is the top sphere is attached only with some thin plastic.I had one fall over and break at the thin plastic.When I glued it back together, it did not work right, so I bought a new one."
3,a cool desk gadget,"My husband admired a similar product in a National Geographic catalog for a much higher price. Be forewarned, the globe is small- 3.5 inches- so it is not easily used as a real globe without a magnifying glass. The base is plastic- not wood as stated in the description. It is difficult to balance the globe between the top and bottom magnets and will take practice if it gets bumped and needs to be re-set. For the price, it is a cool gadget. This one is NOT the one that rotates (although when the ceiling fan was on it did rotate somewhat.) My hubby likes this but to me it would just clutter my desk and be one more thing I'd have to move to clean up."
4,Good explanations of poses,"This video is great at explaining the poses, even if you have never taken Yoga before. She keeps the new-agey stuff to a minimum and focuses on the poses themselves. I would suggest (as she does) to watch the video once all the way through, and then practice the poses.I had to stop after the first 1/2 hour the first time I did the poses, because I was pooped. After the second time, I was able to do the full hour of poses. Feel free to pause the video while you get your props and yourself in position."
5,This book hits the bulls-eye!,"This is a business book that sifts through the superfluous and presents an abundance of concise, effective and time-tested principals for doing business. It is destined to become a classic. ""You can't go wrong by doing it right"" speaks to the business novice as well as the seasoned executive; it should be required reading in the classroom and boardroom. Kudos to Dr. Goldstein for resurrecting the lost art of doing business the right way. Perhaps the title should be, ""You can't go wrong by reading this book."" I highly recommend this book without reservation."
4,interesting,Heard Al on Art Bell talk show and believe the original story. this is a spin on a real event. The real story is much more thought provoking and lets you into the secret world of black ops in the past. Actual records exist in the Dept. of Defense about this read them after you see the first movie and before the second movie. END
3,Confusing!!,"I really wanted to get a good grade on the ap exam, so i bought the ap bio cliff notes and kaplan ap bio pre book. I found the kaplan book so confusing. Some notes were good, clear, and thorough. However, i found most of the them to be very confusing and difficult to absorb. The good thing about this book is that they have a lot of great diagrams taht are very useful. I also have to say that using the practice exams in the end of the book really helped. Practice can make all the differences. One last thing, the cliff notes of ap bio is really really good. I advise you to buy that, along with another prep book. Using two can really help. ps. i got a 4 on the exam without answering the lab essay question or the lab multiple choice questions."
3,"Decent Review, No Substitute for Good Teacher","This book offers a decent review of most overall AP Biology concepts. However, it skimps on some main themes. While an adequate supplement to a good class and a good textbook, it cannot stand alone. However, I had a less than perfect teacher and used this book to supplement her assigned readings. I passed the test with a 3. The book is great for cramming the night before. It's concise in that way. Good Luck!"
3,Only a Review,I have bought multiple preparation guides before taking the AP Biology Exam last May and I have concluded that the only books worth my money was the Cliffs AP Biolgy Guide. This book only offers general information and can be compared to a regular biology book which I have access of. It may not be the guide that helped me pull a 5 on my exam but may be used for extra but not primary review.
4,The good and the bad.,I love this this monitor for what I use it for. I have a dual monitor setup one LCD and one 930SB. I use the lcd for any text based work and the 930SB is for gaming/picture editing. I like the 930SB because I haven't found an LCD that can display an image as nicely as 930SB can. Remember that LCD are going to be sharper that crt for viewing text.
4,Excellent monitor,"This is the best monitor I have used (outside of *very* expensive professional ones). Fantastic image. My one gripe is the noise of the transformer. There is a constant buzzing that NEC/Mitsu has indicated to me is ""normal"". In an office environment, one might not notice it. In my near-silent home office, it is starting to become annoying. Otherwise, this is an excellent display for the money."
3,"Good Monitor, but not ""Pro""-quality","This is a good overall monitor, but it's not ""Professional"" quality as its name might suggest.While color reproduction is excellent, text can be a little fuzzy, especially if you switch to a higher brightness mode.There are also two thin horizontal lines running across the screen due to monitor's internal design. I don't really notice them on a dark background, but they are visible on a white background. It's very annoying to see this on a monitor with ""Pro"" label...A nice touch is the ability to adjust monitor settings via downloadable software. There is also ability to auto-adjust geometry and other settings to save you time and headache.To sum it up, if you are into graphic design or if you mostly work with office documents, you should look elsewhere.If you want a monitor for games and movies, this model will work great for you."
4,Dental duplicating material,"As a dental professional that holds a certificate in Dental Therapy and a BSc in Dentistry(DDS), working in the dental field for the past 14 years. I found this book very interested. I must be honest in saying I have not complete reading the entire book. From what I covered, it is very detailed, it photos, advantages and disadvantages of selected materials, etc, which enhanced understanding. I think it is up to date with the dental materials that are so ever changing. I will reccommend this book for dental students and dental professionals."
4,Having fun on the farm,Our 3 year old and 6 year old love playing pretend. This item gives them the chance to be Roy Rogers and the Lone Ranger for a while. They each have one and they love them.
2,Schleich western riding set,"This is the biggest waste of money I spent for Christmas. Rider and saddle only, TAKE NOTE OF THIS. I bought others much cheaper elsewhere just as nice and with a horse! Not easy to find horses and riders in this market, but they are out there, look around before buying this."
3,Idiot me! - I did not carefully read the description!,-- CAUTION - THE HORSE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS AMAZON ITEM!!! WHAT MORE CAN I SAY - I DID MANAGE TO FIT IN ON A REARING STALLION - BUT THE RIDER THEN LOOKS LIKE HE IS ABOUT TO FALL OFF -
1,dissapointed!,BEWARE- no horse included! I ordered 4 of these for my grandchildren. They were not only dissapointed when the horse was not included but the rider did not come with the set either. When I wrote in to inquire about the missing person-NO RESPONSE!
5,Wonderful!,"My 3 yr old grandson has a zillion of the Schleich horses, but wanted a saddle for them. couldn't find one locally, so I ordered this. It is perfect! Comes with the blanket, reins, etc. It is quite durable, like the horses, and fits almost all of them. He plays with it constantly."
4,My only complaint...,The only bad thing about this set is that the riders legs are not long enough to go into the stirrups. Otherwise we love all of these sets. Several people have complained that they thought horses came with the set but it plainly states that horses are not included. These toys are very well made and have given my three children hundreds of hours of playtime!
3,"By no means, their best","In the early and mid 70's the Strawbs were one of my favorite bands.The addition of Dave Lambert on lead guitar and vocals in 73 was a Godsend at first, but the songs he wrote on his own became cheesier with each passing release. I do agree with another reviwer here that ""Deep Cuts"" has some fine moments, but ""Burning For You"", aside from the great title track is downright embarassing. If you're looking for a good starting point to get into with this band, for God's sake don't start here. Start with ""Bursting At The Seams"" or ""Hero and Heroine"" The band went into a steady artistic decline after they left A&M in 75. The material they released from 1969-1975 is by far, their best"
3,THIS IS JUST A LOBBY FOR NOMADNESS & 2WEEKS LAST SUMMER,One can see there is a consensus that the 2 cd's don't match up to the need to release Nomadness and Dave's solo album Two Weeks Last Summer (also a must for starving Miller Anderson fans) Deep Cuts contains some classic Strawbs material but Burning for You has only one or two acceptable songs which makes the package a little annoying...and yes boo hoo John Hawken is gone by this time. Kirby and Mealing create atmospheric texture rather than inventive fills. I saw the promo tour for the release of Nomadness just after Hawken had left. The keyboards were inoffensive but the energy and focus was somehow dissapated which carried over into these recordings
2,PDR Prescription Drugs,"Sirs;I ordered this book with the undestanding that this was the latest edition. Unfortunately, it wasn't and far from it. I had a previous version which was about 10 years old and it was very good in covering the drugs on the markety at that time, but didn't include two of the drugs that are prescribed to me or the two replacement drugs suggested by my insurance company. The 9th edition didn't have any of these drugs listed (all very common drugs) either so it was a complete waste of money as far as I am concerned. Why would you market out of date publications without some advise as to the availability of a later version? Maybe I didn't look far enough when purchasing this version, but this is the one that came up in my search process in your web site and I presumed it was the latest one.Tom"
2,Okay book,It probably was a good book when it first came out but now it is outdated because old drugs are no longer listed in the updated versions of drug reference books. It did not list any updated current drugs. Good book for older drugs still in use.
4,VERY GOOD BOOK FOR INFORMATION ON MEDICATIONS. I ALSO BOUGHT AND SENT ONE TO A RELATIVE WHO SEEN MINE AND WANTED ONE.,"WE HAD FAMILY FRIENDS STOP IN FOR A VISIT, ASKED ABOUT SOME MEDICATIONS AND SHOWED HER THE BOOK AND WERE SO PLEASED WITH HOW CLEAR AND EASY TO READY AND UNDERSTAND. ASKED IF I WOULD PLEASE GET ONE FOR HER. I ORDERED , IT CAME VERY QUICKLY AND GOT IT TO HER AND NOW HEAR OTHERS WERE INTERESTED IN HER AREA. I CERTAINLY USE MINE FROM TIME TO TIME. EXCELLENT REFERENCE BOOK."
3,"Keeps your interest , but very choppy","The novel discloses how two women meet, become friends, and through time disclose their darkest secrets. Although the book kept my interest, it was written in a very choppy fashion between chapters and sometimes when switching characters. There were also some absurd descriptions of sexual abuse which I found to detract from the story. It was as if she tried to create a dramatic effect quickly and it floped. the development of the character who was her son could have been developed much further. She also could have written this book with an ending that would have allowed her to continue with a series of books following this friendship, but did not.It was a fun fast read, but seemed to be written as a formula novel, and it was too choppy. Clean up the rough spots and you could have a much better novel."
4,D_LI18 Replacement battery,Works fine. I needed a spare battery when I'm on trips this helped alot.Good product
3,Father Michael McGivney,"Interesting story about the founding of the Knights of Columbus for Catholic men during a time when Catholics were not welcome or could not participate in other fraternal societies. Like most biographies of priests at that time it doesn't tell the whole story of hardships endured, but it was a good enough presentation of that era."
2,"Ideals, Environment, Priority, Action.","""Parish Priest"" shows a man with an ideal to be a priest for our Lord. How this happens and the influence of the Holy Spirit puts the reader in time with the social needs, people environment, adjusting daily priorities,and actions with courage to do the best he can. It's a faith, hope and love of life."
4,Interesting Look at Piece of American History,"Most Americans have a idealized view of life in the previous century. But we don't realize the level of discrimination and the lack of resources many people faced. Catholics, in particular, could not own land in certain states or areas and had to pay taxes to support other religions.Brinkley's book introduces us to Father McGivney, a simple parish priest, who did something to make his parishioners' lives better through his work with the Knights of Columbus. Even with 12 years of Catholic education, I did not know the story behind the Knights of Columbus nor what function they really served beyond marching in our local parades and organizing countless bingo nights.Brinkley's writing style is easy to read and the book doesn't drag. What a great gift for the legions of kids who are currently preparing for their confirmation! And while the subject does profile a Catholic priest, I think American history buffs would find this a good read as well."
3,An Okay Biography,"Although, I'm assuming that the authors were hard pressed to find enough information on Father McGivney to create a full biography, it doesn't really come off. When the information on McGivney is hard to find we get other information in its place like general history of the time and the Catholic Church in America. Although this is somewhat interesting, it doesn't really fulfill the bill of biography. His later years has much more information, but since he died young it's not enoigh. What can the authors do when there just isn't enough information? I don't know, but I was a little disappointed."
3,Parish Priest,It is ok. I do not read very much but I bought becasue I am a member of the Knight of Clumbus and I want know a little more about him
1,Interesting and Enlightening,"I recently became a member of the Knights of Columbus. Curiosity caused me to order this book.I enjoyed it, and bought three copies to be distributed among my brother Knights, and also the young males who are soon to become members of the newly-forming Columbian Squires at our parish."
3,"Truly a ""Servant of God""","""The Parish Priest"" is a narrative on the life of Father Michael McGivney, who founded the Knights of Columbus. This is a book for those interested in the founding and growth of the Knights from one council to thousands today, and 19th Century Catholicism in the northeast U.S.The process of canonization for Fr. McGivney was initiated in 1997. With approval, Fr. McGivney would be the first American-born priest to be canonized. It is clear from this book that he was truly a ""servant of God.""The book is written chronologically and is filled with great detail. One feels as if he/she is reading an observers' diary."
2,Very very funny,"Actually this is a good cd for what it is. But Chris Farlowe is ghastly - he oversings on everything, and his ""blues"" phrasing is offensive. I enjoy listening because he is trying so hard to sound ""black"" but fails so miserably it's funny."
4,Nice stiff bristles,"I like this brush because it has nice stiff bristles that really scrape the inside of my pellet stove 3"" pipe. I use it first, then I use a softer brush to pull out any remaining fine dust/ash. I found it difficult to push it through a 90 degree elbow, however."
2,small print,"it is both German to English and also English to German - Title does not make that clear. The type is very small, to include all this. And a lot of words are missing (German words) - In some cases, you have to know the roots of the words in order to look them up."
1,This is not working the way I want,"I was so excited to receive this transmitter, and was hoping it would help me in all ways, I am a photographer and have my own studio so this was ideal to be able to make shots with out any complacations in the way. Before this I was using wire line between camera and studio lights. No good ;O)Anyway i thougt this would help a deal but I can't say it has. The transmitter only sends signals from time to time, I have tried changing batteries constantly but It dosen't help. I find my camera flass working better, there for this transmitter has been packed away. I still cant believe it has failed my expectation. Sure was not worth my money."
1,The veridict is not in yet...,"I was very excited when I first received the item to go along with the Interfit Studio Lights I ordered. The unit itself is rather light and flimsy, but I figured it really just needs to fire off the monolight flashes and does not need to be a durable piece of photographic equipment. Batteries installed easily, took my first dozen or so photos and the unit worked perfectly. Soon it would work only every other time even when my camera position had not changed. Then the unit would have to be switched off an back on in order to work. I thought the batteries might be going dead and thought this thing was a battery ""drainer"". Put brand new Energizer batteries in. It worked for about a dozen wore shots then stopped working completely! I intitiated a return with Amazon in hopes that this was a defective unit. When I get my new unit delivered I will update this review to let you know if this was a defective unit or if the unit just plain does not work well."
3,Dissapointed,The three Springbok puzzles I purchased were nice puzzles as far as the scenes and the degree of difficulty are concerned. I found them roughly cut. On three of my puzzles about 7 percent of the pieces had been not been completely cut through. The backs of the pieces were rough and that made it dificult to make them lie flat.
3,Disney CD,"The latest release is a so so compared to others Disney released. The first CD is great, but the second one is full of really old stuff that I doubt many ever saw."
2,Quit before I finished. Couldn't take it anymore.,"I got 2/3 of the way through this book, but couldn't take it anymore. I quit before I got to the end. I gave this book more than a chance and picked it up to try again on several occasions. The hero is some girl's fantasy of a man. The dialogue and actions for him were distracting. All I kept thinking was ""men don't talk like this or act in this way."" The sex scenes were confusing. At one point, I didn't even know they were having sex until it was over! The writing wasn't the best, but it wasn't terrible either."
4,A great place to begin exploring colleges.,This is a great source of basic information about thousands of colleges. Includes contact information.
5,MUST-HAVE!!,"My review will be short and sweet. If you are a true lover of great music, you need this CD. It is a blend of jazzy hip-hop with neosoul influenced r&b."
1,the worst video in history,"Man, I cannot believe in those reviews - and I cannot believe I have spent my money with this rubbish. It's the worst video in history - no, I do not mean the worst ""climbing video"". It's so amateur that my grandma videos are way better than this."
5,Way Classic,"Inertia 1 is raw and rad. Inertia 2 is non-stop, Randy Leavitt and Iker Pou climb routes I only dream of..."
3,A History Lesson,"I see to sentiments in the reviews:1) It was the first video of it's kind. It started the current climbing genre. Therefore it has intrinsic worth.2) The director, Josh Lowell, was young. This was his first video of any consequence, and we see a lot of antics: kickboxing, milk drinking, snot blowing, girl watching, etc.Thankfully Josh managed to grow up a little, and he has been producing some of the best climbing videos in the industry - including King Lines which has garnished awards from across the globe.Like some of the other reviewers, I watch this one with my finger on the fast-forward/skip button. There are a lot of great climbing sequences - and it's fun to see what some of the guys (like Chris Sharma) looked like 10 years ago."
2,makes sends look too easy,"one successful send after another leaves you wanting to see some struggle, conflict, =something= to represent how hard those climbs really are. also fails to identify location of climbs, although name of climb and rating is given. punk music."
1,NOT A CLIMBING VIDEO!,This is a WASTE of money and should not be called a 'climbing video'!!!It is the most amateur DVD I have ever bought -my home videos are better-.You have to fast forward all the time; as between VERY VERY SHORT climbing clips are various childish pranks and people skating and boxing.You start watching a climbing scene and puff! someones puking milk...Non-Climbing clips are UNNECESSARILY long and ruin the climbing scenes.I agree with the other reviewers that this should be edited or described properly so people who are looking to watch climbing scenes are not fooled into spending $25 on this.Should be categorized as a home made glimpse into climbers lives or something. NOT a sports/climbing for sure!I do not recommend this video at all!!!
1,Good sequences with a ot of scrap,Not a bad video as far as just the climbing sequences are considered but the intermediate sequences are just innapropriate. Climbers are not the kind of creazy people we see in the intermediate section nor are we necessarely amateur of kick boxing. I was deceived to see that climbing was associated with Jackass activity.I have take this video as a practice for a new producer who was short on tape. I do not recommend this video at all
5,Instant Classic.,"This is the first climbing DVD I ever bought... And it is still the only DVD I watch over and over to get motivated to go climb. So much good climbing on hard routes! Action Direct, Book Of Hate, Sharma, the list goes on and on... Super Classic."
3,Pretty but hard to see,"The design on these cards is lovely. They are, however, hard to read when playing bridge. The numbers blend into the background."
2,Bridge cards,I love the pictures on these cards but they're almost impossible to read when you're playing. I'm saving them for solitaire.
3,"Leaking, but functional","The way these may be shipped to you may mean they leak slightly. When I received this 12 pack, all of them had oil in the cap, which would then spill out onto the counter, your fingers, your clothing - when opened. Attempts to pour the oil back into the container were for naught. Though I don't think it will detriment the life cycle too much, its annoying and messy to have to deal with. Be careful when opening these, they might have had a rough trip to your door.Otherwise, no issues."
