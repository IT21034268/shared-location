1,PLEASE don't buy this book new!,"DO NOT buy the new version of this book! It won't come with the CD or access codes, and anyways the book companies are now required to sell each bundle component on its own. With this book, the workbook (Quia) is now *only* sold separately - and cost me $70 from my college bookstore (you can also purchase online at Quia Books). Get the textbook used for the cheapest price possible (from a reputable dealer). There is absolutely no reason to buy it new unless you have a need to have a copy never touched by another student. =)"
1,Do Not BUY!,I also bought this book for a college class and it didn't include the CD that it CLEARLY put in the description! All that money for nothing.
2,They sent me the teacher's edition.,The book was in great condition(5stars). The only problem was that I ordered the student edition(SE) and they sent me the teacher's edition(TE). The TE had all the content the SE had but I was running the risk that my teacher wouldn't allow me to use it for class.
4,The title that will remain forever,"First off i would like to say that that is nuts that their is a video option to leave a review. Technology has come far in such a short time. None-the-less, i ordered this book because i didn't feel like paying $140.00 US dollars for it at the college. Even that in actual value those $140.00 paper bills are only worth about $1.40 Us but its ok. the book is aight. It is like most other spanish books in which i have looked at. I think it's also well laidout and is very comprehendable for just about everyone. I would recomend it to anyone wanting to learn some espanol. Also if anyone would like to take it off my hands en la media de mayo (in may) email me. Adios amigos."
5,"Very good CD, OK DVD","There are different version of this tour. This one includes a live cd and a live dvd. The sound quality of the cd is very good, the songs are very good, cd has 23 tracks. Ken-Y`s voice sometimes sounds a little exhausted, but thats ok for a large concert. With the cd you already get a live feeling. The DVD is not that good. Picture quality is good but the footage is shoot in different video formats. As the Tour begins you have the whole TV-screen filled, then all of the sudden you have a black fence at the top and bottom and so on. The sound is also just stereo but it is clear and clean. For fans a must."
1,Nothing new!,I got this DVD and at least expected something knew but was surprised that it was just episodes we already had...I couldn't find a description of the episodes on Amazon so here you go (so you don't make the same mistake I did)Max's ThanksgivingRuby's Figure 8Max Misses the BusRuby's Piano PracticeIf you don't have any of the other DVD's this would be a good start for you. Max and Ruby is always gentle and free of violence and my 2.5 year old daughter loves it.
1,old episodes under a new name,I thought this would be new episodes but we already own all of these on other DVDs. I am disappointed.
1,Wish I Would Never Have Received It,"My daughter received this video as a gift. At first, I thought it was cute and she really enjoyed it. Then I noticed that my daughter was mimicking some of Max's less desirable behavior, such as only speaking in one word when she was more than capable of whole sentences. I sat down and really watched the video with her and realized it teaches little except bad behavior. In each episode, Max is basically told not to do something but does it anyway. He suffers no consequences, and in the end, some random event makes everything Max did work out for the best. I've put this video up on a high shelf and hope never to get it down again unless I'm throwing it away."
1,Disaster of the last Panzer,I was very displeased with the move and found it intolerable to sit through the whole picture. ... A honest review from a true military buff!!
1,Not Good,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The vocal/visual movements of the mouths did not match up throughout the whole movie. The helmets the Americans were using were not correct. The weaponry that the Amercans were using were not correct, as well. The weapons that the Americans were using, weren't even used in WWII; they weren't even invented yet!"
1,Ultimate Pinball Disappointment,"Well I can't say I didn't try. Two different copies, same results-crash to desktop and autoreboot. The website offers no patches or technical aides. A direct request to tech support only offered an exchange after going through the standard 'make sure windows updates are installed, make drivers are current, etc.' and no real effort on their part to help me trouble shoot. I tried installing and running under two different versions of Win XP with no luck. At this point the cost of return certified postage (as recommended on website after you are granted authorization for return) is going to cost more than the game is worth. Guess it will make a pretty drink coaster....."
3,"Buggy, but kinda fun.","I really like pinball and I thought this would be okay to chance for under $10 bucks...The first game I tried to play, UFO INVASION, has this weird glitch where you can't launch the ball. The plunger goes right through it. (I have since seen this same complaint about this game in some gaming forums). I then tried a few of the other games, which seemed to work fairly well, then tried ALIEN WURM, which won't play and ultimately freezes the computer. I contacted ValueSoft, who told me my computer might not meet the requirements. It's a brand new Alienware and far exceeds the requirements. Then they said I should update my video drivers. They were up to date. What they really need is a patch, because this software is buggy. But the tables that do work are fun, and I'm hoping they come out with a patch soon."
2,Breaks quickly,"I bought this product a couple of months ago. It took me a little time to get around to actually changing the vacuum belt. When I finally changed the belt it only lasted about 3 weeks. I don't have a big home, so I'm not sure why the belt broke. Nevertheless, I don't recommend this product. Its a good thing it came with 2 belts."
5,VENI VIDI EMI,"I needed these vacuum belts. I bought these vacuum belts. I installed these vacuum belts.Oh, who am I kidding? These are possibly the best vacuum belt ever created by man. These belts have been to hell and back with me. Brought some of these belts with me to Afghanistan. I wrapped the belts around my boots so I could kick roadside bombs of the streets, into space! Simply applying a piece of these belts to a standard bullet immediately turns any rifle into a bunker buster.Also, can be used as a cheaper alternative to your replace your Livestrong bracelet.-Good quality-Great price"
4,OK,"OK, nothing specialThat is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!"
5,Vacuum belt,what can i say about vacuum belts? they were what i had ordered and they came fast and my order was complete.
3,Pretty good belts,"I've purchased these belts a few times. I would not recommend vaccuming ""shaggy"" carpet with these belts cause each time I have, the belts have busted. I thought it was simply a coincidence, but each time i vacuumed the same shaggy carpet, the belt bust. Other than that, the belts work fine."
1,Not what I wanted,"From the title I thought it would have been understanding the body from God's point of view. Instead it is an 'alternative' theology of embracing your body for what you can get out of it, or do with it in opposition to God's view."
5,Solid set of performance wires,"I really like this wire set. Unlike some ""performance"" sets I've had in the past, these wires attach firmly to the plugs but don't feel like will come apart when you pull the boot from the plug. MSD did a good job on these and they look good, too."
5,Wire sets works great,"I replaced both my plugs and wires at the same time, so I'm not sure where to attribute the results of using these wires. After my tune up, my engine runs much smoother and things I hadn't even noticed before like slight engine vibration, and things I did notice like pinging at idle and high loads are gone. There is less engine whine through the stereo, and the insulation is definitely thicker and the boots feel durable and pop tightly into position. These fit perfectly on my 5.3 engine in my '02 GMC Sierra. Amazon had the best price with free shipping."
3,John Denver does Shakespeare,"I was disappointed in this CD. Unable to preview the tracks, I ordered it thinking it would be Elizabethan music. It isn't. Clark has a pleasant voice but the music is kind of '70's easy listening. In fact, the music and Clark's mellow voice seemed very much like John Denver's blander work.I'd rather listen to the sonnets read than sung in this fashion. If I'd have been able to preview the tracks, I wouldn't have bought this CD."
5,A Must for Shakespeare Buffs!,"This unique little gem of a CD is a must for the Shakespeare fan--be it teacher or simply aficionado. If you enjoy the sonnets, if you enjoy the guitar, if you enjoy folk singing, you'll love this. William Clark pours out emotion, humor, and talent in this novel undertaking. Make the Bard's words come alive in the classroom. Enjoy listening in your car. It's a winner!"
4,Great side table,"This is a really great small side table. Although it is labeled as a travel CHAIR, it is very uncomfortable as a chair and would have better use as a table. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 is because its a lousy chair."
2,Very small table,"Much smaller and shorter than I expected, but still useful as a side table for a chair."
5,the best sex guide ever. ever.,"The Big Bang is frank, hysterical, and full of naughty pictures. It manages something I thought was impossible in a sex manual - it answers your questions without making you feel like a freak or a prude. It's an amusing and engaging read even if you're not gettin' any, and if you are, it's indispensable. This book couldn't get any cooler, not even if it came with a ray gun."
1,THe Big Bang,"Very dated graphic wierd nasty not as nice as the ""kama sutra"" or ""everything you wanted to know about sex"" maybe good for a teenager to scare them off sex forever..."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,If you read Em and Lo's column on Nerve.com do not waste your money buying the book. There is nothing striking or extraordinary about their book that others do not have. And even more so the book is a carbon copy of their stuff on the website. Why waste the money?
2,"Move Along Folks, Nothing New Here","This book promises so much, yet delivers so little. Nothing new can be found in these pages, and the book seems to talk about sex as an excuse for publishing pictures of semi-attractive people in various states of languidity. Save your money: better advice can be found elsewhere, along with sexier pictures."
5,best sex guide yet,"I love the playfulness and excellent prose. It is witty without being crass. There are passages that made me laugh out loud.One criticism, the book is primarily for hetero men and women. So why have photos of gay men? for hetero men this is not sexy or appealing .It really detracts from an other wise great book.Just as gay men are not interested in hetero sex why interject this for heteros?"
5,"Finally, Nerve disposes the covers!","There are only three species that indulge in sexual activities for pleasure, amongst which, humans probably differ most significantly in two factors. First, they have the most complex social constructs involving them; and second, they are probably the most hypocritical about it. Although people have explored it at depth and in as creative manners as can be thought of, few have dared to speak of it as this book. Those new to sex, it enriches with a plethora of information and guides them to make their journey as pleasurable as ecstasy gets. Those already in deep waters, it shows them ecstasy of several unexplored areas. And those explorers out there, it takes them on a tour, connecting them with several thoughts, lucidly put together. Ditch your inhibitions with your Dad's copy of 'The Joy of Sex' and dive in. To the authors: Applause n Kisses."
4,Great background info on a great group,"PBS does a great job is providing an unbiased documentary of the group of brave flyers. Hollywood does a great job of entertaining, PBS did a great job of educating."
4,Documentary,Great documentary and goes well with the movie RED TAILS (starring Cuba Gooding Jr.) Purchased them together as a Christmas gift for my father and he loved them both. Very entertaining and educational. Would recommend to anyone especially teacher's for their class rooms during Black History Month.
1,Don't even think about it...,"This game is ONLY for hardcore starwars fans. If you are looking for a fun mmorpg and you dont care about graphics, play Ultima Online. Or if your into mmorpg with nice graphics, then wait for the release of World Of WarCraft, since its a blizzard game, you will get what you expect."
1,this game is crap,i've played it for a year and 10 months....i just cancelled my subscription. this game is now the worst game i've ever played due to the recent changes.
4,Notes from a SWG beta tester,"With the release of this game, I am now free to discuss the beta test. This game is fun! I've enjoyed exploring the planets, cities and buildings from the Star Wars movies. The worlds are large and full of things to see and do. Character develpment allows for variety to create custom characters. This game will only get better. Planned expansion packs include vehicles, ridable creatures and space ships plus more worlds to explore. Anyone tired of the same old hack and slash fantasy games should consider SWG."
4,Star Wars Galaxies,"This is a game different than all other MMORPGs. Instead of just getting out in the middle of the desert and shooting wamp rats, you can build a rifle for someone do just that. Instead of kicking at a Durni on Corellia, you can learn to dance or play an instrument... you can even start a band and play in an amphitheater. The great thing is, you can shoot things and kick 'em in the face, too.The point I'm trying to make is this: If you don't like combat, don't like dancing, don't like exploring, and don't like being a medic, there is still something for you to do in Star Wars Galaxies...Heck, you can even meet Darth Vader... Or Princess Leia.Oh and by the way.. I know this because I beta tested the game for 3 months.... Im not just making it up."
5,Innovative and Fun,"As a beta tester of SWG, I feel this is one excellent MMORPG. For any star wars fans or for an traditional RPGers, I'd highly recommend this game. It's fun, exciting, the graphics rocks (especially when there's a bug and NPCs are naked, hehe), and the game play is definitely long lasting."
5,Dude this is better than a Dell!,"This has to be one of the best MMPORGs that will ever come out. Lucas Arts made a good decision on this one.I think if you enjoyed everquest, even a little, and you are a star wars freak (like myself) then you must get this one."
1,Don't even bother!,This game will soon die. $OE is an arrogant company that does not listen to it's PAYING customers. Combat is so screwed up and the game is filled with bugs. Stay Away!***** Update 1/03/2013 *****You can now play this on pre-cu servers! Google SWGEmu.
1,Welcome to Star Borked Galaxies,"For the record, I have played this game since it's release and have invested quite a bit of time and, let's be honest, money.Recently Sony Online Entertainment had decided to overhaul the game system, with what they call the ""Combat Upgrade"" and have effectively rendered this title unplayable for both NEW and OLD users of this game.I strongly suggest that you save yourself time, money and frustration by chosing a different MMORPG (online game) that isn't under Sony Online Entertainment's banner, as they are not very responsive to critical issues or customer concerns.If you are a dedicated Star War's fan, such as myself, I would wait at least 6-9 months (Dec 2005) for them to fix the god awful amount of bugs that is present in this game before purchasing it."
1,This game is broken,"It used to be a fun game until Sony Online Entertainment decided to install the combat upgrade on April 27, 2005.As of now the game is boring and very buggy.I'll tune in with the other reviews - save your money."
1,Terrible customer service,"Don't waste your time with this game.I have played since the game was in its original beta, and it was fun for the most part until now.The customer service is horrendous. If you file a complaint, you're either banned or your post on the forum is deleted. SOE has even fired their own employees for disagreeing with their decisions.Gameplay as of April 27, 2005 has seriously been degraded. It is now slow and boring and virtually impossible to play. I suggest that you save your money on this one and play a different MMORPG that is not published by Sony."
1,Nothing new...not even the title,"I know alot of games are relying more and more on tested markets but still if I play a mmorpg I want something new. I want something different.I always thought Star Wars was way to cheesy. Ewoks? OMG, its a kiddy movie. Realy, if you are older then 11 I would try something like EVE Online."
1,A Perfect example of how bad a game can actually get,"Please note then when the disclaimer on the box reads ""Game Experience May Change During Online Play"", they mean it. This game used to be my favorite, I'd spend hours a week playing it some times more often then 1 should. The latest patch known as the ""Combat Upgrade"" has turned this great game into what I would call a rat. You see a Rat is an annoying pesky little creature that no one really wants. This is what SOE(Sony Online Entertainment) has done to this game. Something that I along with hundreads of others no longer wish to be a part of. Do yourself a favor and save your money because this game is probably the worst on the market along with its expansions."
1,Combat Upgrade Riddled with Bugs,"I started playing this game over a year ago from this post. Please be aware that if you do purchase this game, you are also required to purchase an online subscription. *DO NOT EVERY PURCHASE MORE THAN A MONTH AT A TIME* Individuals who have paid 3, 6, or a year in advance are unable to obtain refunds from SOE, even for unused prepaid months.You should also be aware that the boxed version is publish 10. SWG is currently on publish 15 I believe. You can expect to download 2 gig of information when you first connect.You should also be aware that current combat system makes crafters and crafting templates very short lived. The Jedi profession is currently broken. So don't plan on having a light sabre your first day in - or your first year in for that matter.I cannot, in good concience, recommend this product."
1,They killed the game,"The recent ""Combat Upgrade"" has totally ruined the game, taking out much of the enjoyment of the game, let alone destroying the accomplishments of most veteran players.I have cancelled my subscription, and going to check out World of Warcraft.Save your money."
1,Don't buy!,"I have been playing for almost 2 years now and I just quit, because of the recent update.The game got absolutely unplayable. Players are abused as alpha tester. Some key features of this update are not working at all. This has been addressed in the so called Beta, but the Devs wouldnt listen. There are tons of bugs now switched live and the devs are fireing hotfix after hotfix. It's a real pain....Save yourself the frustration and don't buy this game."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"I had heard of this game, and wanted it terribly because I thought it looked so cool. Finally, I conviced myself that it couldn't possibly be as good as my mind was making it out to be. Then I played it at a friend's house last night, and found out that I was wrong.This game is incredible. Period.And I have realized this after only a few hours of playing. I am now on a quest to go get the game for my very own. So, I'll be off doing just that as soon as I finish this...*walks out of room, out of the house, and down to the store*"
1,WARNING - doesn't run on laptops,it would have been nice if lucas arts had bothered to tell us that this will not run on laptops. you can't upgrade the graphics card on a laptop to enable you to run it either. I have a 2GB PC but this still won't run! REgardless of your views on the game - don't buy it if you have a laptop
2,not as good as others,this game is not as good as the other star war games it dosent have a very good grapics it is not fun at all if i were you i wouldnt get this game.
1,A great game ruined,"I've been playing since launch, but up until about a month ago, I was taking a four or five month break from the game. I played WoW a little bit, but when I got back to SWG, I realized how much I really loved the game. Then the Combat Upgrade hit.The game is now pretty much unplayable, as far as I'm concerned. People complained about the game being ""too easy"" and about how everything in the game can be killed solo. Well, fine. Then balance it. But SOE overcompensated and made EVERYTHING much tougher than it should be. It was underbalanced before, and it's severely overbalanced now.SOE Customer Support is HORRIBLE. They don't listen to you, they don't care if you have problems or make mistakes. Don't expect any help at all if something happens to you. SOE is truly one of the worst companies I've ever dealt with. The customer is always wrong as far as they're concerned.Play WoW or Guild Wars or something like that. But pass on this one, my friends."
1,Worst Day Ever,"I bought this upgrade for my brother's birthday. He loved Star Wars Galaxies and I thought giving him the upgrade would be the best gift I've ever given him. Boy, was I wrong. Now he hates the game, he tells me that everything he worked for over two years to build for his character has been wiped out. Trying to rebuild what he lost has become nothing but a headache.If you're planning on giving this ""combat upgrade"" as a gift to anyone - don't."
2,My experiences,"I've been playing this game since it came out and it was the best game I've ever played! However with recent changes and the lack of bug fixes the game has degraded to a beta that will never be fixed. Bugs that have been in the game since the start are still there! Example: When you are working on the jedi padawan quests 4 out of 5 times the npc won't spawn to get the quest or finish the quest making you spend countless hours running around trying to get around the bugs, and with the recent changes more bugs are introduced.This game may seem fun at first but after playing it a while you'll realize the company doesn't care about fixing the game and would rather just let you keep paying the money to play a broken game."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"sorry, if you were interested in buying this game, it was a good game, before the new 'upgrade'. now it is ruined. no one on line, nothing interesting to to and so simplistic it hurts"
1,Don't buy this,"The developers of this game have done just about everything to alienate their customers. Just about every update to the game has introduced as many bugs as corrected bugs. They have announced updates that have never come to pass. They have made changes to the game that make your character obsolete. There have been bugs in the game that have remained unresolved for years.Simply put, don't waste your money on this piece of garbage."
1,Stay away,"Unless you enjoy paying to beta test a 2 year old game, stay away. if you want to try it at some point wait a few months at least(as of may 11th)."
1,A Good game Turned Bad,I have been playing SWG for about 4 months and have loved every minute of it. I would get off work and play the game for hours with about 7 of my co-workers. The CU has ruined the game to the point where all 7 of us have quit. Don't waste your money unless you see that the Cu is gone because the game WAS good in the PAST. Sony should be ashamed of what they have done to such a good product. And Lucas should be ashamed of letting Sony do this to their game. If you don't believe me go to www.swgpetition.com
1,The Jedi?,"This game was great up until a few days ago, when the combat upgrade hit the live servers. Now it has gotten so bad that a Swordsman can take on 2 Jedi Padawan at once, and it be an even fight. This swordsman had no armor, and both Jedi ran out of force power near the end of the battle. Thanks SOE great job ...... yeah right!!"
2,at first its fun and exciting but later its a drag,"I have been playing since it was released and it was great fun at first because you could become overpowering and dominate all. Later everything that was great became too weak and therfore we all had to discover the next best thing. Everytime we discover how to become great at the game they come along and change things. Now they are catering to the Jedi and there are too many of them already and it no longer follows the story line.Too many changes for the wrong reasons.The missions are painfully boring and repetive.Grinding your way to higher skills can takes months of extremly boring mouse clicking over and over or shooting the same things over and over.On the good side, the graphics are pretty and its great for socializing with people all over the world.In total too much time wasted for too little enjoyment."
2,I think SOE secretly hates us,"I had this game the first day it came out. Thats when I got the suspicion that Sony Online Entertainment secretly resents the fact the make games. Why else would the put such an incomplete game out on the market? After 6 months of patches I think it is half way to a complete game, after 6 months more maybe they will of gotten it right. Or maybe in 6 months the developers will of gotten lazy, or too busy with EQ2 patches.If you are into any of the following this game is for you:repetative open ended game play (not that annoying the 1st 2 months) don't mind a thin storyline (I didn't realy mind this), like grinding exp hours on end (only annoying when trying for the master slots). I am not mocking in any way.If you want to be a Jedi Master just get Knights of the Old Republic."
2,I get better pleasure cutting my front lawn,"This game is the worst mmorpg I have ever witnessed! If you are a true Star Wars fan, stay away from this. It is certianly not Star Wars...more like Pokemon with good graphics.Customer Support is horrible so you're basically paying 15 bucks a month and receiving little to no help with technical issues or gameplay or lost items issues.Server downtimes are bad as well as the mechanics of the game. While I rate the graphics very well, it just doesnt compensate for all the other ""junk"" that comes with this ""game"""
2,Great grapics lousy game,"This game has so much potential but i don't think it will ever be realized. The graphics are amazing. The customizing of characters is extremely detailed. Ok i'm done with the praise, now to the real stuff. 1. 14.99/month isn't worth it to play. 2. Sony has the WORST support i've ever seen. they make so many random patches it's rediculous. it's just a testament to their inability to code it right the first time. 3. Get ready to lose your character a lot. I've already lost my character twice in the past 5 days. I play, sony patches, i go to play again and ""poof"" my character is gone. generally it's that patch part by sony which screws it up. this was also a problem with everquest. Go spend your money on dark age of camelot, it's a little less per month and way more stable. Or if you are cheap go back to counterstrike and diablo II."
2,A buggy pile of crap,"This game will be the death of you in frustration. The concept is fantastic, and serious steps have been taken to immerse you in the Star Wars Universe. Unfortunately, Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) does not seem to have shaken the ineptitude demonstrated at the disastrous bug filled launch. The game continues to be riddled with bugs and crashes. Players are leaving the game in hordes.The truly disgruntling part is that SOE appears to be aware of the problem but not delegating enough priority to it. Chats with members of the testing server indicate they are pushing content over quality. Bugs are still apparent on the testing server, but they put out the update anyway.It sounds like a sinking ship to me. Do you want to waste your $50 + subscription fees on it? I refuse to anymore. Asked for a refund, and got a cold ""you agreed to pay"" statement. No apologies or concerns about the bugs, just the cold statement. Nice customer service, eh?"
2,Not for international players,"Best not to buy this game if you are in Asia or Australia. All game servers are in the US and they all go down everyday for 1.5 to 2 hours in primetime playing hours (evening). It's ok for US players as this is early morning, but for the Australasian time zones, forget it. 2 hours downtime everyday is just madness!"
1,Totally Wrecked,The developers managed to take a fairly fun game for me (even after about 2 years of play) and botch it up. I have a jedi and I cant even bring myself to play anymore. I have given it a couple of days but I dont see it working out anymore. XP gains are super low and you will use most of your health or force pool to kill 1 npc or creature now. SWG used to be unique. The combat system used to be different from all the other games and now it's just another in a long list of rehashes. Star Wars name or not it's just garbage now and it's a shame.
1,When good games go bad,"I played...note the past tense...this game for close to 9 months and loved it until the Combat Upgrade was introduces just a few days ago. What was once a fun, enjoyable game has now been turned into an exercise in futility and frustration. If you want to save yourself both of these emotions and a little money then avoid this game like death! If by some chance you like screaming at your computer, pulling out your hair and getting nowhere fast, then this game is right up your alley!"
1,Just check the average of ratings,"The ratings are almost entirely one star since this combat update, and it is such a shame. People who have been posting against it are not only disappointed in the product, but are hurt by the fact that they REALLY LOVED the game before the update...the game you are buying is wonderful, but once you connect and it gets updated into its present form, you will see exactly how uninspiring it is...I would not flat out recommend you don't buy it, but I would recommend you wait a few months, so that when you do buy it, the game might not be in a condition that sours you on it immediately. They did build a great game. Admittedly they almost entirely trashed most of the things I liked about it, but the people are still there to maybe make it good again."
1,This is no longer the game I paid for.,"Two years ago when I purchased the game, it had absolutly amazing graphics. Players enjoyed a wide variety of professions, one could be an crafter, fighter, Doctor, even a Jedi (with much hard work), and could even mix up the professions a bit to make a custom character to suit ones needs. Now there are only 9 professions, including Jedi, players once having selected the profession of choice are forvermore stuck in that class.Scale of 1-10Graphics: 9User interface: 1RPG Genre theme: 3 (this game is more FPS than RPG)Customer Support: 1 (customer support fails in all respects)with all the other RPGs out on the market now, no need to waste money on this one."
1,CU Killed SWG!!!!,"I've been playing SWG for a year now and while it was lacking in areas, overall it was fun and felt like Star Wars. Now that the CU has gone live the game is unplayable, unfun and well... dead. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
2,Jedi??????!!!!!,"This game can be alot of fun but I WANT TO BE A JEDI. I know that i would need to train and i dont want it to be too easy like KOTOR but I haven't seen a single jedi. If you are a Jedi please email me so i at least know your out there. The other professions arn't worthwhile yet, bounty hunters??? wheres the bounty??!!! I think i just had 2 high of hopes for this game and was comparing it too much to the original star wars trilogy."
1,think carefuly before you buy this game,"(nov 18 2005) this game is so full of bugs and has real bad lag, its almost beta even though its been round since 2003. this has only happend recently (nov 15) after a major system update, before this update i would have given it 5 out of 5 now its barely worth 1if your going to buy this game just because you can be a jedi then bewarned you'll only be a jedi in name in this game as they have no real powers and are one of the weakest combat professions.look carefuly at the star wars galaxies forums before you buy.maybe given enough time this game will be worth playing again but for now give it a wide birth"
2,So much potential then SOE ruined it,"SWG is a game with amazing potential. The world is beautiful, characters are great and well, it's Star Wars. Sadly Sony Online Entertainment is running the game and all they are interested in is money. Issues have not been fixed since day one. Repeated promises are broken or put off in order for SOE to finish the JTL expansion. They ignore the cusomter base and bad mouth us in review magazines. DO not buy this game until SOE is no longer running it."
1,"Horrible, insignificant","You thought this would be better than everquest, playing a wookie on different planets, tons of nerding for sure. Unfortunately it is nothing BUT everquest. Sure it is addicting but the design is fundamentally weak and the graphics are brilliant but only because it is funded well.It's pretty much mmorpg back to the basics, don't get this game whatever you do"
1,Save your money,"This is quite possibly the worst MMORPG ever conceived. SOE believes that its only responsibility as a game maker is to provide you with a character, a very limited ability to improve that character, and a laser gun. After that, you, the player, must invent things to do, and pay SOE for the privilege. SWG has almost no content. You will max out your character in a couple of months (even as a casual player), complete the handful of working quests, obtain the few items, and then .... well, you will wander around wishing you had not paid for a year's subscription. I beta tested this game, joined it at launch, and played for 6 months before I stopped deluding myself that SOE was ever going to make this game any better. When the game was first marketed, SOE made the statement that after you max out your character, ""that's when the real fun begins."" They were right. The real fun begins when you quit this crappy game and go play some other one."
1,lies and empty promises,the makers of this game do nothing but make empty promises and lies after lies while nerfing anything and everything that is useful to the player. if you do not have 10 hours a day to play this game you will never make it./endSubscription
3,NOW the Galaxy is TRULY Divided,Thank god for WoW and Guildwars.Atleast the Galaxy is TRULY Divided now.People who play the game/ /People who used to/ /The game itself.
1,Be prepared,"I bought this game for my son, a Star Wars fanantic, we own every other game and all the movies. But we were really disappointed in the fact that this game was only online, with an additional monthly fee. It was difficult to set up the account, and even my son did not think it was worth the fee to continue playing past the first month. Basically we have an expensive computer game sitting on my son's computer, and not being used. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless they change the use of it to include playing off line also, and making the monthly charge more reasonable. As to the game itself, the playtime was lagging so much that we were all very frustrated, when it was not lagging and was right on with time and such, it was a great game. All this confusion and there is a computer expert is the house also...."
5,NERFED!!!!,"I am rewriting my review because the SWG team at Sony has completely ruined the game. I played it and loved it for over 2 years, then NGE completely and utterly destroyed this game. Sony is scrambling now, I see commercials on TV now and offers with them giving away the expansion packs if you buy the game. This game WAS great, now it is your typical, linear MMOPRG, but only in the Star Wars universe. You may like it, but be prepared to go loner, because when I ended my sub, there was hardly anyone on any server I checked out. Gets prettly lonely when you are all alone in a universe."
2,Star Wars Galaxies ... They let us down,"I do not recommend anyone buy this game. The new Combat Upgrade does not work well and Sony Customer Service is doing a great job ignoring their customers. I have been playing this game for over a year (my Wife also ) ... We have 15 accounts ( yep count 'em 15 accounts ) . The folks that run this game are pushing a product onto the public that is so out of context with the original game and the veteran players that it has lost its appeal. We have spent hundreds of hours playing this game with great enjoyment and have made a lot of friends. Now we are going to cancel our 15 accounts and switch to some other game. Sorry folks, I say Do not buy this one!"
1,Spend your money on something else...,"I would never recomend this game to anyone as it is now! Sony have managed to destroy a game i loved until 27th of April. They released a so called Combat Upgrade, dispite a lot of players protests, and they released it in an Alpha state.If you asked me a month ago, I would gladly recomend it.But since Sony Online Entertainment showed how little they really care about their customers, no way! In fact, i would stay away from all titles that has anything to do with SOE. They obviiously have no idea what customer service is.So don't throw your money away on this..."
1,"Once Great Game - Ruined by ""upgrade""","I just started playing this game about two months ago. Within a few days two of my brothers and my son also had accounts. We have played it constantly since then, and really loved the gameplay. Yesterday Sony released a ""combat upgrade"" that is simply a game breaker for us. It so heavily changes the overall game mechanics that the way we had been playing is no longer possible. The only option in this game now is to focus solely on combat, and in large groups.The game had a strong player based economy, where crafter like weaponsmiths, armorsmiths, entertainers and chefs complimented various combat professions in a delicate balance that kept the economy running. The changes to the game force you to either surrender your profession skills and take up more combat skills, or die - and die a lot.It's a sham, but the 4 of us will be canceling our accounts before the next billing cycle. I will never buy another game developed by SOE again."
1,The Devs have ruined this game stay away,I have played this game since launch and have recently quit due to highly protested combat upgrade which sucked the fun out of this game.
1,Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Ruined,"I broke down last year and entered the world of MMOG with Star Wars. I swore I would never pay monthly to play a game. But SWG changed all that. It needed a bit more content, and some balancing but the overal system was good. Then comes the much awaited combat upgrade, promising to fix those little problems within the game. Unfortunatly the upgrade was pushed out the door before it had been thoroughly tested and was released to the live servers. Many things don't work. Grouping to gain experiance is now forced if you want to gain levels, and unfortunatly not many are grouping so you will spend 2 hours just trying to find 1 or 2 players that will join you. Everybody just stands around now. It is so boring and sadening that they have done this to try and capitalize on the upcomming movie. Stay Away until they fix these problems"
1,SWG is not worth your time or money,"I played this game for more than 14 months. This amounts to a total of 284.99 when you add in the cost of the game and the JTL expansion. After the recent in-game combat update, a software update which changed how the game is played, I cancelled my account. Not only that, but I managed to get customer service to pro-rate my account and give me a refund for the time un-used. This is actually against their supposed policy, but let anyone know that they can do it and they do give refunds. So when you consider the purchase of SWG, just think about this, there is a petition available at www.swgpetition.com with more than 16,000 signatures on it demanding the game go back the way it was. So please, be smart with your money, go play something else!"
2,Caution...,"The game is not ready. You will be paying to beta test. While some seem to find the amount of bugs, lack of content, and promises of features like playing a Jedi and flying spaceships *to come sometime in the future* acceptable, many do not. While this game has potential. It is with sincere regrets that I would caution anyone from purchasing this game in its present state. I would say ""Wait until December"" and see if they have improved it. Also by then the cost of the initial game will have dropped considerably. I'm sure they'll have an expansion to purchase by then as well. Wait for a bundle deal."
2,BUGS BUGS BUGS!,"I've been playing the game for about a week and every time I play I encounter a huge number of bugs that interfere with gameplay to the point of making the game unplayable. The bugs present in this game keep players from progressing, purchasing items, and making money. I cannot believe that they have the gall to charge a monthly fee in addition to the price of the game for a game that should still be in the testing/development phase. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead on 1 is that the graphics are great, and the players are generally very ince and helpful, other than that this gamne is a huge waste of time and money. For example, I spent and hour and a half doing various missions which yield experience and money, and in the end ended up with 0 experience and 0 money. And I'm paying a monthly fee for this? They should be paying me for trying out their game and reporting everything that's wrong so they can fix it."
2,This is still beta,"For anyone who has experience with gaming it is easy to see how this game wasn't ready for release. Doubt my claim? Try logging into the official forums...you cant! not until you buy this game. Why? Because for the most part there are NO positive posts going on in there. The game is a mess. Each patch breaks it even more than the last. There is no content. After running the initial missions you will find yourself getting very tired of the rinse and repeat aspect this game is based upon...the skills are very unbalanced, some classes dont even work at all and the customer support is practically non-existent. Not to mention that most players just run around with pet monsters..not droids...but monsters that can kill entire parties in PVP. I wouldn't waste the money buying this until Sony fixes half of the problems with this game."
1,Game went bad with the new update.....RUINED THE GAME,they ruined the game with the CU...oh well....will miss the friends i made and the fun I had on it when it used to be decent...don't waste your time or money like i did
1,CU/Comic Upgrade ruined this game,"I loved this game from day one almost 2 years ago and went through all the changes, but the CU I cant stomach anymore, I gave it a shot and sure if you like grouping with friends Im sure it might be fun. But all my friends have already canceled and tried making new ones and they hate the game now too and cancel and trying to solo and get xp has become impossible now. I have a Jedi too and they forced us to have to group now if we want to gain xp so now we could be hunted consistently by BHs. So unless this game goes back or gets a major overhaul again. Dont waste your money, this is still a beta and shouldnt be paid for or have a monthly fee. Ive gone to Guild Wars (no fees)."
3,"For PvP fans, or those who like xp grind","I know a lot of gamers like PvP play, and this game is perfect for you. But those of us who like content other than camping player corpses so you can kill the same person eighteen times, the grind was unbearable. I actually stayed with this game for about 9 months, mastering 3 different fighting styles and 2 crafting styles. After that, I didnt touch another MMORPG for over 6 months because I couldnt stand the thought of grinding thru more xp. A good beginner game, nothing more."
3,"A good Game, But not That God","As a Beta Tester of Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided I can only say that it is indeed a nice game, but Not What you exepected ...Sure is has the best graphics of all MMORPG (and you will run them at 11fps even with a Top PC system), sure the sound Is great but Its Not Star Wars as you would wish it to be ...The Combat is tedious (""for newbies to play"" they say), the missions are simple and they all look the same (destroy a Camp/hive, escort Him from point X to point Z, go to point X, pickup a package and deliver it to point Z).The game just dosent feel right (a laser based blaster has a maximum range of 64 meters).oh well, it's a good game, they say it's the best MMORPG ever made, If so is true then I don't even dare to play the other MMORPG games ..."
1,SWG Letdown,"First off, unless you have broadband or DSL, be prepared to spend hours trying to down load the huge patches, and if you're not the only member of the household who wants to use the phone, be prepared to spend the ""Free"" month of play you purchased with the game, downloading before said uber patches! Methinks the game was released too early, with too many bugs! And SOE does not, and will not, offer a disc with the patches on it! With that said, and you still want to buy this pathetic game, then see some of the other reviews about gameplay. It takes forever to advance, hack/slash game play, and mundane gameworld. About the only thing going for this game are the graphics."
4,Game is FUN don't believe what you read,"This game is fun, Don't believe what you are reading about it. If you like Star Wars you will like this game.There are things broken with this game. Mainly dealing with Combat. Some classes are are unequal to others. It's this way in real life, though so to me I don't see it as a problem. If you spend months mastering a profession you should be powerful.Buy the game. Play as a imperial first, do all the missions to get the cool stuff then play as a rebel. Some content is available to that specific faction. There is game content to be had. Searching in a search engine will reflect numerous sites with info."
1,"Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs","This is a great game crippled by game altering bugs. I spent two months putting up with them and finding ways to work around them, then finally one came I had no way around. After not being able to play for a week due to it, I cancelled.This game needed at least six months to a year more of beta. It's unplayable right now."
1,"SOE makes good games, but they come at a price","SOE is the amazingly greedy company that in their previous game charged you real money (and a lot of it) to get things done. They promise customer service, then start a new game server with ""improved customer service"" charging 3x the price of normal service, and neglect everyone else.The kicker of this game is you will only be able to have ONE CHARACTER PER SERVER. On top of limiting you to one character per server, which limits family play, you will have to PAY MORE THAN ANY OTHER MMORPG IN EXISTANCE.Expect monthly rates to go up, and customer service to go down. When people get sick of the service, they will offer you a better service option, at an increased price. Avoid all the headache and price guaging that will come with this game and wait until World of Warcraft comes out, Blizzard has yet to make a bad game."
4,From a beta tester,"I've been a beta tester for SWG for about 1 month. I find the game very enjoyable. The development team was sooo great about fixing bugs and have worked incredibly hard to make the game as enjoyable as possible and so have the beta testers. You can choose from different professions and live out your Star Wars fantasy life. You can live off the land as a scout, make goods as an Artisan, or perfect your shooting skills as a Marksman. As a veteran Roleplayer, I've found vast enjoyment in roleplaying with the other members of the galaxy! Go out there and have fun, and don't forget to visit Jabba on Tattooine. He may have a job or two for you!"
4,"SWG, gaining steam for me.","This is only my second MMORPG experience. Everquest Online Adventures being my first, the PS2 game. Coming from the PS2 game, I found SWG to be very complex. I had read that EQOA was ""simplified"" for the Playstation and I guess that was correct.I've been playing SWG for 5 days now and am finally starting to feel more comfortable in the game. I run into people who say they aren't enjoying it yet, but I am not one of them. Perhaps I'm just enjoying discovering the play system, but I am enjoying myself. I am signing up for a full year subscription to it because I really feel a lot of potential in the game.I hope this was helpful for someone. I'm ready to get home and back in the Star Wars universe. Maybe I'll see you there."
1,Ruined by greed,"SOE has dumbed the game down so that it not worth playing with its latest ""Combat Upgrade"" Everone has been ""Balanced"" in other words no-one is different. Buy WoW ow Guild Wars this game blows now."
1,Great game gone bad..,"I have been playing since the launch of this game. Its one of the best games Id ever played, however the premature launch of the new Combat Upgrade has brought thousands of its players to tears. Its horribly hindered by the bugs and coding errors thus making the game hard to play and understand. Also because this new upgrade doesnt even have an online manual(tells you that its still being tested) your questions go unanswered. I would recommend that you wait until they have finished the Live server testing of this game before you waste your money."
1,SWG no longer playable,"Save your time, money, and dignity. Play something else. This was the greatest game ever, then they ""upgraded it"". Now I'm canceling 4 accounts and apologizing to my friends and family for wasting my time on it."
1,Demise and possible bankruptcy in store for SOE?,"I'm not sure what SOE's intent was in the Starwars galaxies upgrade, but the result may be their demise. They truly dropped the ball on this latest CU upgrade fiasco to this once great online game. The result, the SOE corporation is mostly going to be defunct and bankrupt in the weeks/months to come due to this disasterous mess they created. And they have no one to blame but themselves! And they are unable to silence the tens of thousands customers, who will no doubt lend their voices to many world wide communicated site and forums. So long SOE!"
1,A ruined game,"I was once a loyal fan of SWG. The game was the best MMORPG I had ever played. For 9 months I built up my character and as soon as I was confident with my template in combat, they throw the bloody combat upgrade at all their long time gamers. I said to myself ""wow this is great they are finally balancing combat"". Then I bought the game and realized that it was a waste of money. It is now just like every other online game as it has been sucked into the ever growing pit of online gaming monotony. I highly reccomend that you invest your money in another game because this one will now bore you to tears."
1,Star Wars Galaxies Downturn after Redux,"SWG was an awesome game, unique among MMORPG's. But recent mis-management by the development team has caused a series of problems, not the least of which is a mass exodus of the established player base. Pleas from the players have gone un answered. It looks grim for this once wonderfully unique gem of a game. I would be surprised if it is viable long-term, and if is it, it looks like it will need to be scaled back significantly, as most servers are relatively empty now. Sad. Not a good place to be now."
1,Not with the Combat Upgrade,"Folks, I tested this game, and paid for this game for 2 in a half years. Basically I spent $3922 on this game from buying it, buying an expansion, and paying monthly. I am a STAR WARS NERD!!!BUT, and that BUT, is a BIG BUT! They added what was called a Combat Upgrade (CU) and it turned this beautiful unique game into a total generic tool of other MMORPGs, so basically it is the same ole same ole. DO NOT GET THIS GAME! At one time, you could have had a unique experience but not now. OVER 80% of the players gave the CU a 1 out of 5 but SOE only banned them and did not listen to its fan base.Avoid this game, and check out Eve online for space, and Planetside for INTENSE fighting!Also Guild Wars is a great game for free (no monthly) and World Of Warcraft is the best game out there."
1,"Was OK, Now it's pretty much horrible","The game had great potential. They started to make some nice changes to the game mechanics and content that started to really improve things. Then came the Combat Upgrade. That is marketing speak for total game revamp. The gameplay has completely changed. Now the non-combat players cannot do business because they cannot get the items they need to craft without hiring player body guards. This is just unforgivable. They went from a Star Wars game to a EverQuest game with laser guns and glowing baseball bats.Players wanted tweaks not a complete overhaul. Save your money or play something like World of Warcraft. Customer service is the worst I have ever seen, and I have played and tested around six other online RPGs."
1,SpaceBalls....,"I've been playing this game for a good amount of time. I was having a great deal of fun until the dreaded CU. Now the only thing worth playing is JTL. So if your going to spend your cash, i'd spend it on a sweet copy of Spaceballs. Cuz atleast you can laugh your ass off instead of crying, then laughing, then crying some more. SOE has driven SWG into the ground..."
1,No Longer Playable. The Dark Side has WON!,"As much as I enjoy the Star Wars Universe, this game is now unplayable. I have been with this game since beta 2, and have been hoping that the game would improve over time. The ""Combat Upgrade"" is nothing less than a complete game redesign--entirely for the worse.If you must play this game--please try to find a free trial subscription (or borrow a friend's account--if you can actually find anyone still playing this game) before blowing cash on this now sad excuse for a mmog. If you do get logged in without crashing, you will likely find few others playing to group up with anyway."
1,LAME,Go out and buy City of Heroes. It is a hundred times better. The only people who could possibly like it are the ones who dress up to go see the movies.
5,The best game ever,I think it is the best game you could ever play. If you got get it their is something wrong with you
1,SOE Devs screwed over the subscribers,"The devs lied and screwed over the subscribing customer. Why pay 15 bucks a month for this? Don't! The new ""combat Upgrade"" has taken everything out of this game that was fun and unique to an MMORPG. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,You Will Regret Investing in this Game,"I have played other MMORPGs, started playing Galaxies from launch and stuck with it for two years only to be disappointed at every change the develpoers have made. I could cry when I think of all the time and money wasted only have the developers ruin it at every turn. Try another MMORPG, see a move or read a book. But, do not invest your time and money into Galaxies!!!"
1,None of these reviews apply anymore,"Was the best Star Wars or online game until the last week in April. The combat was reengineered, crafting dumbed down and was published with all manner of bugs. If you are new to the game then you wont know the difference and may find it fun. Anyone who has played this for any length of time is fed up and leaving."
1,SOE has stopped listening to its customers,"I took a break from SWG to play World of Warcraft for a while. I CAME BACK because the community was unique and the skill based game play appealed to me more then level based game play. The recent push of the Combat Upgrade (CU) has changed that. It was pushed live before it was properly tested. SOE tried to apply level based combat in a skill based environment. The jedi quests are impossible, a lot of the non combat professions were broken because they were 'outside the scope' of the CU and even elite combat characters die without masses of friends to help them with quests. SOE pushed this live before it was ready and isnt responding to the outrage of loyal players who feel their gameplay has been ruined as a result. In any other industry, an IT team would lose their jobs over this kind of project launch. Dont buy it. SOE doesnt care about you having fun, they just want your money."
1,This game used to be fun...,If you wanted to play starwars galaxies you should have bought this a year ago because now it is not worth playing. The New Combat Upgrade has made the game unplayable. Try something like guildwars or WOW. Do not waste your money on this.
1,The Combat Upgrade KILLED this game,"I have played SWG for almost 2 years, ever since public launch. And while the game wasn't perfect, 95% of it was. It could have used a little tweaking here or there.Instead, SOE threw the baby out with the bathwater. They made at least 6 professions TOTALLY useless. They added new animations and graphics that are distracting and hidious. Combat is VERY buggy now... and professions have lost all uniqueness. Combat is no longer fun due to the addition of a level system. If it is the same level or lower than you = dead. If it is higher than you, you're dead. You know the outcome of combat BEFORE you even start it.I loved SWG before, now I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."
2,Jumped the gun a bit,"A bunch of my friends were beta testers and after the NDA was lifted they said the game wasnt ready. This is obvious to me now. SInce I arrived home with it i have only been abl to play for about 20 minutes. This is due to 1. Registration not working properly 2. Constant server disconects, and lastly the entire database is now down and no servers are running. Ya think the game was released a bit early? Can't wait to get in there and see what it can really do."
1,"*STILL* beta, and worse","Having played this game since the 2nd week of beta 3, I can tell you - it is still in beta. Constant nerfing plus new bugs being introduced - the new mounts and player cities added many more problems than fun content. The Star Wars feel is very much lacking also. Most combat is against strange monsters - call this EQ in space, not Star Wars. You'll need to go out of your way to find storm troopers or NPC imperials and buildings.Mostly though, I'm just incredibly fed up with all the bugs and problems. The latest costing me over 30 high-end weapons (as I'm playing a weaponsmith) when the server decided to delete my shop's inventory. This happened to many, many people too - much worse than my meager losses.In summary: Save you money."
2,Too much Crafting,"I'm sorry to say, but my idea of fun does not revolve around collecting resources and crafting items.This game is for the Socializer/Crafter."
1,Good gone bad,"This once was a thoroughly enjoyable game. The new changes to the system that came Nov 15, 2005 make this a laughable MMORPG. There are still MAJOR issues with lag (less than 10-30 FPS). The alot of the game still remains bugged. The combat system is slow and simple. If you have played any other online games, don't waste your money or time on this one."
1,STAR WARS GALAXIES a game bound to die,this game was great up untill the so called COMBAT UPGRADE which should not even be called an upgrade since it is a whole new game. The only thing that makes this game Star Wars is the name. Good Bye SOE you have just lost both my accounts so that mean im going to be $30 richer this month.(...)
1,The game has died,"Something known as the ""Combat Upgrade"" has killed this game. This game is not playable. This game has become a replica of EQ II, everything from the icons to the controls. SWG before the uprade was novel in its feel and playstyle. It is a dang shame. The outcry from the community has been immense. Environments are empty, ghost towns even. The end has come."
2,Disappointing,"It's Star Wars, right? Well, sorta. More than a year after release, numerous professions are still broken and fixes to the core game have been postponed over and over in order to make way for the expansion coming out soon. The short of it: spend your money on almost anything else.Pros: It's a beautiful setting, it has a Star Wars feel to it.Cons: Broken professions, poor response from developers to constructive customer feedback, poor customer support, current subscribers leaving out of frustration and boredom."
1,game ruined,"The ""CU"" as they call it has totally ruined this game I have played since april 16th 2004 and now have to cancel both my accounts. SOE does not listen nor care about customers. avoid this game at all costs."
2,Wait a few months ...,"The bottom line here: I've been playing this game for just over three weeks here, and it's the buggiest piece of computer software I've used in probably ten years. It's fun when it works. But almost every system in the game is, somehow, broken. Missions don't work (in several ways). XP awards don't work (once again, in several ways). Badges, a feature mentioned in the manual, don't seem to exist. Items disappear from inventory and from bank accounts. Player corpses disappear. Monsters and players suffer frequent rubberbanding. Framerates in the cities can be horrendously low (think 1 frame per several seconds). Frequent crashes to desktop. Frequent ""Connection to SWG Lost"" messages. And it's actually getting _more_ difficult to connect to the game in the first place.*sigh*Don't make the mistake I did and pay to beta-test this game. Wait a few months. When they've had time to finish it, I think it'll be great. Until then, it's just frustrating, frustrating, frustrating."
1,Put Your Money Elsewhere,"I played this game from July 2003 to April 2005. The producers of this game broke faith with their customer base. They significantly altered the game experience and playing style. They made changes to the game that were not requested by any significant segment of the player base.The game population has reached an all time low. Many veteran players have voiced their dissatisfaction and canceled their accounts.Just look at the reviews here and at other gaming review sites - it takes a serious foul up to cause such an uprising. I LOVED the SWG game in its original incarnation. Now it is but a shadow of what it was.Ask yourself - Do you really think THOUSANDS of former players would be going out of our way to express our discontent if everything was just fine? No. This is Sony Online Entertainment's ""Boston Tea Party"" and we are not going to take their breach of faith lying down."
1,Stay away for at least six months,"this game is half of a game. There is very little content and most major game systems are still broken and have been from launch ( more than a year ago now). Worse yet is the lack of attention to customer service complaints and overall gameplay. I would not recomend this game to anyone. It is the second major disapointment to come from SOE for me (planetside was about as big of a disapointment).If you are looking for star wars feel, this is not the game to play, as there is very little about this game that makes me think of starwars. Its a shame that SOE has done such a poor job with the Lucas Arts license."
1,An empty shell of a game,"This is a textbook example of releasing a game unfinished and hoping to finish it while we pay. Only problem is that the game has so many bugs that they have been forced to spend all their time ""trying"" to fix bugs and almost no time finishing the game. Result: After a month of play there is little or nothing to do and the PvP is so unbalanced that everyone either plays on the Empire's side or they die - alot!How many Jedi are in the game? NoneHow many Droids? Very few (bugged profession)How many vehicles? NoneMassive Star Wars Battles like in the movies? NoneDungeons? VERY fewLoot/Drops? None (they don't believe in drops)Any ""reason"" to enter the few dungeons they have? NoneAny reason to play SWG? None (the graphics are nice)Number of promises? ManyYou will have fun for the first month and then run out of things to do. You have been warned :)"
2,Monthly Fee !!!!,"When I ordered this video game, I did not realize it required a monthly fee and had to be connected to the internet to play.I have printed the RMA and will be sending the package back on Monday.I feel that I am not alone in overlooking this requirement.The yearly fee needs to be posted PROMINATELY next to the picture of the game.I am extremly disappointed that I was "" duped "" into buying this game.Lucas Arts has disappointed me and I'm sure others feel the same."
2,An Empire Disappointed,"This game is just plain dumb. There are way too many glitches with animations and character movements. I find myself walking right through some objects. Don't buy it now, wait until some of these horrible bugs are cleared up. Wait until the Jedi fiasco is figured out, too."
1,horrible repetitous waste of time,"poorly executed, boring waste of money and time.... after 1 year of being out its still being tweaked and tuned... and what they call ""nerfed"" some things that you work so hard to become, get ""nerfed"" so they are no longer effective. The missions are horrificaly boring and the player vs player warfare is poorly done.....graphics are pretty however."
2,"Good, but when does it speed up?","I bought this game (unknowing about the little $14.99/month text) a week or two ago, and I'm very disappointed in it. I have one word: Lag... I have a DSL connection to the internet, 2.4 ghz, and 256 mb ram. I don't know whether it's the ""recommended 512 mb ram"" that's killing me or not, but I get total lag. Even when I turn down most of the effects and graphics, I still get nothing but slowdown and frustration. It is a beautifully done game, but it just disappoints me that I get so much Lag! If anyone knows any critical ways to speed this game up, please post them :)"
3,Not the best,"The concept of this mmorpg is great, I see many great features implemented that the others should have.But as far as overall gameplay and play value. I must honestly say, I stayed for 2 months (1 month free with game) then cancelled.I just became bored at trying to 'raise' my skill points to learn new things. As it seems that is all I was ever doing.Not my idea of fun =/ Although I am sure others will see it differently.If you like mmorpg's you should at least give this one a try."
3,Not Ready for Primetime,"Good potential, but it was released too early. This game has the ability to be the best MMORPG, but it fall way short of that will all of the bugs. Wait about a year and then it will be good."
2,The force is not strong with this one...,"This game sucks. You kill and kill and kill and kill and you never go anywhere. The player economy is a good idea but damn if its not hard to find people to buy really good stuff from. The quests never produce decent items and its STILL got too many bugs. As Akbar said, ""It's a trap!"""
3,Pretty good game for a few months.,"Galaxies is a good game with a lot of bugs. Apparently, this isn't uncommon in the MMORPG world. As a previous reviewer said, once you master a few professions, the game itself is kind of boring. I recommend if you buy this game you find some online friends and make the most of it. The online community is the best thing going for this game. I quit the game in the end of January, and I would've quit in October if I hadn't met a few good people who made the game worthwhile. In the end I was paying to play a game I rarely logged on to, so I ended my subscription.There are bugs, and there are many nerfs and restructurings. I understand that things must be changed, but the developers seem to weaken classes before making the weaker classes on Par with the stronger ones. That's my biggest complaint.Good game, but only good for a few months."
1,Good concept -very bad game,"Like a lot of people I signed up for star wars galaxies hoping to live out my fantasy of being in the rebel alliance or being part of the empire. I was very disapointed. Many of the gaming mechanics are very off, although they did get correct some mistakes from other rpg's they really messed up on a bunch of other stuff. One thing is this game is STILL in beta, despite what the game developers might say. You are PAYING 15 dollars a month pluse a 50 dollar game to test and trial for them. The game is great for about 2 weeks if your a non-crafter. If your a crafter its great for about 2 hrs. Buyer beware. Try this game next year this time when they worked out all the bugs. Remember this does NOT include the space edition which will be another 50 when it comes out and another entire set of bugs."
1,filled with bugs and no one cares about fixing them,"Skip this game if you are a star wars fan. There are too many play stopping bugs and vanishing items. Most of things in the game do not work. Items that give bonuses are broken and a majority of class not even playable to any reasonable extent. The skils for every class are only partially implemented. This This game really feels like a early beta game that is about 1-2 years from release. The servers still down for 1-2 hours a day, and it not even for fixing bugs, probably just unstable."
1,Yikes!,"I admit I am not an expert at these types of games but I love Star Wars and I am a big fan of DAOC so I thought I would give this a try.It's terrible. It's very hard to understand what to do and what the point is. Fights with mobs are way too long. While the graphics are great, the game play is boring and encumbered. Not an enjoyable experience. Don't waste your money unless you have a friend that can explain all the details. Not new user friendly."
2,I warn you!!! do not buy this game!!!,"I just want to tell you guys this. I bought this game and was like. ""This is awsome!"" but i never got to play it! I bought this at sam's club and after I left I noticed you after you spend $... on it you also have to pay like $... every mounth! I'm sorry it looks cool and all but its not worth it...no game is! I would maybe do that if I did not have other things to pay for. So this is just a warning....please do not make a fool out of yourself like I did."
4,Revival!,"I bought this software for my boyfriend. Although the official servers went down in 2011, a private and open-source project revived the game and it is currently up and running. He absolutely loves it! Glad I was able to find it for him, it being outdated software at this point."
1,Amazon is blocking customer reviews,"This game sucks, but you will never know because amazon is systematically blocking cusomter reviews."
1,Don't bother...,"Maybe I just had too high of hopes for this one, but I didn't even finish the first free month before I got bored with it and canceled my subscription. Honestly this is more of a tedious job then an entertaining game."
4,A little frown on LucasArts...,"I've quite a bit about this game, and it looks like a very good game. I myself, am an avid gamer and Star Wars lover.I am a MacUser and i do video editing, and stuff. Unless somebodys heard something i havent, i dont think this game is coming out for mac, which really disappoints me. Although the game looks great, and plays even better, im sad its not coming out for mac."
4,Why can't we use the game for lan parties,While this game might be the best game out there. It does leave a little to be desired. Why not have it set up so that a groupe of people can link their computers together to play? Facing a human if more fun but What if I don't want to play someone from across the country or from around the world. I can tell you why that these games are good but not the best. Why pay to play a game that you have to buy? if anyone can answer that question then here is another one. Why won't some internet providers offer Dsl at reasonable rates? If you can answer that one then you have the right to post an opinion about a game. And rember that Dialup is what most of the country is still doing.
1,SWG is now Ruined by latest update!,"Even though the Wookie extension has not come out (which I bought three of and will be requesting a refund for), SOE forced a combat upgrade on everyone despite the cries against it. One of my accounts (I have five) is a artisan and does not fight. They made it so i cannot wear any armor at all and I was killed by a lowly animal just trying to reach my vendor on the gentle planet of Naboo. I have played every day since the beginning of the game and loved it! Now I am forced to leave because it has morphed into some sort of strange game I have no desire to play anymore. It's very depressing and I will miss all my friends and will miss playing with my characters. It's simply horrible and I think SOE must WANT to destroy (end) the game or something cos everyone I talk to in game tell me they are leaving the game also due to this horrible upgrade."
2,Careful with this game,"I have played this game for over a year. I loved it. Recently, they released an untested upgrade to the combat system. It ruined the game. In the current state, I would strongly recommend a different game. If they fix the new upgrade it used to be one of the most complex games on the market. If you are looking for a game where the people making the changes take the consumers comments seriously this game will only frustrate you."
1,Combat Upgrade,"This game is now nothing like it was stated on the original box. It is a sloppy mess of EQ2 style play overlayed on a Star Wars look. There are many bugs cause by the current ""upgrade"". Customer support is minimal at best. They took a working game and made it into a non working one. SOE basically has shown total disregard for their customers with this. Many customers complaining and their words are ignore or erased on forums board. I would not suggest this game even for the die hard Star Wars fan. lacks many qualitys that you would come to expect from a Lucas design. I think the name should be changed for it is not Star Wars anymore."
1,Poor customer service,"I would have previously rated this game 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately I am no longer able to play due to a 27 hr download via dial up for a recent patch that I am unable to make(DSL and Cable are not available in my area). Poor planning by Sony to inconvenience paying customers, especially in a shrinking market now dominated by XBox and PS2 gamers. It would have been so much easier to add this new patch to the upcoming Wookie expansion due out fairly soon. I'm disappointed to cancel an account that I've had for almost 2 years. I've got to spend my gaming $$$ elsewhere now."
3,I Twitch Forever,"3 stars should be a neutral rating. I'm only giving this game 3 stars because it hasn't been released yet (i'ts been pushed back so many times that I lost count) and from what I know it won't have all the anounced components like vehicle drivability and all the diferent races. These things won't be available for almost 8 months after release. Sure it sounds like a great idea for an MMORPG but untill it's released we won't know for sure and by the way, aren't BETA testers under a non-discloser contract? If you are a BETA tester and you're posting reviews and details of/about the game (and by the way readers, they are not testing a finished product, this is a BETA which is in no way indicative of the final code), said testers should be aware that they can get in much trouble for this and can even be sued for a good deal of money."
1,CU Upgrade ruined a good game,"At one point in time I would have given this game 10 stars across the board without blinking. I said at one point in time though.As of late the game has been ruined by the Combat Upgrade put in place.If you are thinking about buying this game, save your money! Look in to some other MMoRPG instead.... preferably something NOT put out by SOE. They have a way of ruining things :(-Sn0rph (Kelly Mattis)"
1,"The new Combat ""DOWNGRADE""...how to make a great game suck!","I had been playing SWG for almost two years, and enjoying every minute of it...until Thursday, April 29th. SOE decided to totally revamp the game with a new Combat ""Upgrade"" system that completely changed the play of the game. If you like to solo, this is not for you. You'll be forced to group if you hope to keep your character alive and earn any kind of xp. I hated to leave, didn't want to, but SWG is no longer fun and a waste of money to purchase. If I could give it negative stars I would."
1,EX-Star Wars Galaxies addict,"I played this game for over a year and I was truely addicted. Heck my wife one time accused me of loving the game more than her. Well since the CU I have canceled my account and the expansion I pre-ordered. One post said the ""whiners"" were in the minority, well I read over a hundred post in this game review and counted 4 that actually like the game now. I'm not a genius but that's in the 96% range that do not like the game now and feel so strongly about it that they had to come in here and express it. One post said SOE were deleting post they didn't like, well I can verify that. I went to reply on an anti-cu post in the SWG forums and the post got deleted before I could reply. In my year I have seen SOE constantly ignore the customers and this was just the straw that broke the camels back. The only person I know that is glad the CU was pushed out is my wife (and she don't play)."
1,What a huge disappointment,"I've played this game for nearly two years, and the Combat Upgrade has generally destroyed a wonderful game. Thousands of people are leaving as a result. The company refuses to address the issues which adds greatly to the disappointment. I feel betrayed by Star Wars Galaxies. Don't buy this game unless you hear that significant changes or roll backs have occurred."
2,The game is amazing but.....,"The game no longer runs but they do run some underground EMUs which is why I bought the game. The game it self isnt the problem, the condition it came is. It claims to be NEW due to it comes in its original packaging. Im not interested too much in the actual box, but if its wrapped in the plastic wrapping, which it wasnt. The game needs to be new in order for the key code to work with a new computer. I payed extra for the rating of MELZBOOKS and because it was NEW. Opened packaging and used key code. Wasted money."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I repeat and URGE you to NOT buy this product.I have played since day one, I have put in well over 600$s into this game since then. Sony will NOT Listen to us. Lucas to busy with the Movies. And the game is FALLING APART.Over 12,000 people have cancled their accounts in 3 days or less. My server was screwed up, I LOST 20 MILLION IN GAME CREDITS. I LOVE PROFFESIONS.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!IF YOU ARE NEW, YOU CANT LEVEL UP!-Fox"
3,Game service and support to terminate,"The service and support for this game will cease to exist on December 2011. There isn't really any point in ordering this product unless you are a die-hard Star Wars fan and want to acquire this to add to your massive collection of Star Wars collectibles.Otherwise, I suggest the new Star Wars PC MMO game Amazon sells here: h[...]"
4,If you like real RPGs you'll Love this game if not...,"If you like Real indepth RPGs with no real endgame then you will totally Love this game. If you are looking for CounterStrick in the Star Wars Universe you'll not get it. This is an RGP not a FPS. However, the upcoming Space Expantion is going to be a Combate Flight Sim and with RGP eliments and not a Full RPG. However, You will have to play the ""ground game"" for a while befor you can FULLY enjoy space so you should go in prepaired for that. Lastly, you must work with others to enjoy this game it is ment to be a fully social experiance. From the crafters being dependant on fighters for supplies and sales to Fighters being dependant on ALL non-Combate Profs to be fully proficant, including Entertainers for Battle Fatuge, Mind wound healing to Medics for Action, Heath wound heals, To Weopons/Armor Smiths to Image Desingers (for a New look to your toon, and to Migrate your HAM bar)"
2,YAWN,"Very exciting when you first buy,....the staying power for this game is just not there. Impossibly long distances to run...all looking the same...and very boring combat and trade skills. Tried every different class and race and they were all equally boring. I'd go more in depth, but this game has been out so long now that hopefully the word is out that it stinks. I know I have let everyone else know.As an aside, this game drove me back to EverQuest. Man, with LDoN and the Bazaar, EQ has new life breathed into it..meanwhile SWG can be pronounced DOA. Since they are both from SOE -- guess it doesn't really matter to anyone but the consumer. Us."
1,Not worth it.....,~This games is totally not worth the money($... monthly). The game has many bugs that are still left over from beta and the development team adds new bugs each time they patch new content.Graphics of the game are top notch but what is that worth when the game has no content.Player cities and ridable mounts are still not in the game months after release when they were suppose to be with the initial launch. That should tell you what kind of development team this game has.What I~~ have found out about this game after 5 months of playing it is that; this game is all about using the Star Wars Name and Good marketing to make a buck. It was a total disappointment for me as a Star Wars Fan and as a MMORPG Fan.Another thing is that if you believe you will be a Jedi in this game; you are dreaming. If you want that option be prepared to spend thousands of dollars on (a website) or be willing to play the game for at least a year before you unlock the FS slot in order to be a~~ Jedi.~
2,NDA Lifted,"Not gonna repeat everything I wrote for the collectors edition rewvie but I have been Beta testing this game for quite some and my suggestion is to wait 6 months before buying it. It is unfinished and you are actually paying to open Beta test this game. If you don't know what Beta testing is, you can look it up :). This is status quo for online games to be unfinished for release and have the paying customers pick up the tab on finishing them. The only nice part I found about this game was the graphics. Aside from that, the game gets very repetitive and lacks a lot of content."
1,Terrible.,"Terrible Customer Service, Terrible Customer Relations, Terrible GUI, Terrible Balancing, Terrible Bugs.They need to create a new genre for this game....MMPOS... Massively Multiplayer Piece Of... well, you get my meaning."
1,Keep waiting until the game is fixed,"I've played several online games and this one is the worst conceived of them all. The combat system is a joke and boils down to who can spend the most money on equipment. Because it's so easy to ""master"" a profession there is little skill differentiation between characters and so equipment makes all the difference. Everyone in the game knows which skills to master to make them the best in combat and so most people look the same. Those that don't follow these templates quickly find themselves locked out of the game as they can't compete. The developers have been promising to redo the entire combat system since March of 2004 and have recently pushed this back until after they try and sell the expansion pack to as many suckers as they can find. There are plenty of better Star Wars based games out there to satisfy your needs and plenty of better non-Star Wars online games. Go with one of those until Sony (the developers) gets this one right."
1,Do not waste your invaluable personal time playing this game,"I have played the previous version of starwars galaxies an Empire divided now for 1.5 years. In that time my primary playercharacter unlocked his jedi padawan.Here is my advice if you want to spend your money do it elsewhere. It's $180 per year and SOE constantly ask for the entire community to wait for the bugs to be fixed. The new system is an abomination. They have ruined the jedi profession.My entire guild, 21 players, are quitting. On their kettemoor server many more guilds are quitting outright. No matter how cheap it is to buy the original game do not get sucked in to paying $15 per month. Find another online game to play."
1,SOE killed great game,"This was once a wonderful experince but now ruined by an upgrade, now possibly the worst game i have ever had the misfortune to play, it could only be less fun if it squirted acid into your eyes while you play."
1,SOE ruined this game :(,"This was a great game, different from any other online game, with the crafting aspects as well as combat. The ""combat upgrade"" is upon us and completely ruined the game and the fun 80% of the people were having, do yourself a favor DO NOT buy this game unless they happen to undo what this just did a few days ago which most likely will not happen. :("
1,Everquest in Space,"Do NOT buy this game. They have taken a totally unique system and turned it into one of hundreds of level grinding games on the net. They recently replaced a Skill based advancement with a level based system. If it were not for the level based abilities, the upgrade might be considered a step in the right direction. Don't waste your time, money and frustration on this game."
1,Great game! Not anymore :(,"Others have posted much of what is wrong with the new version, there's lots more wrong with it but I'm not going to beat a dead horse. To be fair there were some improvements, just not nearly as many or as significant as what got broken. What got broken was the entire game. Some though may still like the sound of the new system and consider buying it. They shouldn't. Star Wars Galaxies is no longer an MMORPG, now it's just an ORPG. Numbers were already down significantly because it's been out a few years and people move on to other games over time. Now they're on they're way towards 10% of peak subscribership with no sign that the death spiral of this once great game will slow down. It's no longer multiplayer as everyone is leaving turning player cities into ghost towns and the only thing massive is Sony's disgrace for destroying a once great game."
1,New Buyers Beware,"I've played as a casual gamer for 6 months. You can absolutely forget about buying this game if you intend on playing solo or as a casual gamer. You will be forced to group with other characters at all times to advance in this game. Don't get me wrong, groups can be fun. But if you are paying $15.00 a month, you should be able to have fun solo or in a group. The folks that changed this game are taking your money and dictating how you play this game successfully rather than you helping to add flavor to a dynamic environment. Should paying customers have some input to how they play? Also, if you are playing oversees (military or Americans living outside the US) you will definitely have a hard time playing. This new combat upgrade forces group playing, but those of us living outside the US can rarely find other folks playing when we are on."
1,Buyer beware,"The publisher of this game, Sony Online Entertainment, recently pushed a combat upgrade that has resulted in mass player cancellations, barren servers, 1000's of bugs, player classes who are unable to play, and broken respecification process that has ruined several long time players. This company expects you to pay to beta test their broken game, then have the gall to expect you to pay for an expansion that they worked on instead of the broken game. Do yourself a favor, do some research on this company and their business practices, then go reward the company that actually listens to their customers."
1,Sony Ruined This Game,"Do not buy this game if you don't like Everquest type games. Until a few days ago, this was the best game out there. Sony revamped the game with a ""combat upgrade"" and now has all of the games loyal fans in an uproar! The skill based system has been modified to be level based like other games. What used to set this game apart from the rest is now gone forever if Sony doesn't revert back to the old system. Save your money and get something else."
2,Don't get your hopes up,"Don't expect too much, and expect to pay $15/month, and you'll enjoy the game, somewhat. Dull combat, tedious crafting, and 'upkeep' that means you have to work, constantly, just to keep what you own.Good luck."
3,"Good for Hardcore SW fans, most should keep looking","I've always liked the SW universe. I learned to hate EQ and UO. This game captures too little of the flavor of the first and far too much of the flavor of the 2nd. Approx 1/3 of classes available involve you standing in place and pressing a key over and over, with little thrill of adventure. YOu can play a bounty hunter, or a Rebel fighter. But the designers have also calculated, to minute detail, how you could also be a doctor (who cannot leave the hospital). Or a musician (who cannot leave the hotel or bar). Or a clockmaker (who is tied to the big crafting machines). Rather than spending so much energy implementing these classes, I would have far rather had ship-based combat. Ah well. I have only played the beta, but I have played for about a month now and have yet to feel anything like fighting in the Star Wars universe. It's EQ in space, where instead of vendors, you have player crafters for your neads."
1,Best STAr WARS game killed......,"SWG was allways something like a BETA for that you had to pay, but it was constantly evolving and - IT WAS UNIQUE!!!(It was never bug-free, but because of it's uniquness and the fact that it was STAR WARS and gave you the feeling of living in the world of this epic saga it was ""acceptble"".)But THIS bonus is gone with the CU, now it is only a clone of some other MMORG'S!It even has lost much of the STAR WARS feeling and of living in a real world - the animation of the chars and the fighting animations are horrible, compared with pre-CU - and the ability to chat with other group-members while fighting is gone now.They also have reduced the big groups of 20 players to only 8 players now and the best gag is: there are some mobs ingame that are even unkillable for this ""full groups"".They have implemented a level-system, that is so horrible that you are not really be able to get a satisfying ammount of XP - you get only 1xp from mobs only 4 levels below yourself."
2,Going Back to Asheron's Call,"I'm biased, but this game blew. Boring bigtime. It's sad that after 4 years, there STILL is not a good PvP MMORPG out that can compare to AC (and I dont mean the turd that is AC2). This game made me appreciate AC Darktide server more than ever. Nothing compares to the addrenaline rush when you have some serious risk/reward in PvP, and can be killed/kill anywhere anytime. Bleh, Star Wars ended with ROTJ... Everquest in space."
1,SWG and the CU,"It seems that Star Wars Galaxies went from a spectacular game to a dud after the ""Combat Upgrade"". SOE decided to dumb the game down to attract a larger clientel and in the process, they alienated their players. The game is extremely bugged since the change and the paying members are alpha testing the game. Avoid this game if you are wise."
2,Some good ideas. . . but,"Setting was great, character options and skill selection and reselection functions were very good as well. . . but who wants to spend 70 hours shooting womp rats or waiting for the computer slowed crafting to take place. This could have been the game for me, and would have been if I had no life, a mind that didn't mind repetion and enough money to have someone else hunt and craft in the endless loop of leveling. Social setting was good except for adolecent nihlists that didn't follow common courtesy."
2,No FUN,"This game is interesting and addictive at first and then your realize things.The Dev's keep changing things in the game, and for the most part they are worthless or make things worse. Like they came out with a publish called driod invasion, big whoop, all it did was allow a few droids to attack, and the current droids are weak. Nothing cool like Deakas (destroyer droids) or IG-88 stlye .Rebels whine toooo much, ya try to role play a bit and act like the Brash Imperials from the movie and everyone starts whining and try to complain to the guild leaders.These things highly Deter from the game and along with the lack of a good story, makes this game fall way short of any Starwars Fans expectations."
2,Boring. Just boring,"Ok, before I become a noob in the eyes of many, this is MY opinion. Listen or do not. My first experience seemed hopeful. I got into a good group, and played for a bit. Then things went down hill. The quests (missions in SGW) are boring and repetitive, and don't think about your levels. You will be tricked into attacking nests full of powerful beasts, or sent to deliver a package halfway across a planet. Most people hang out in taverns, bars, and cantinas, and do not actually embark on missions. Furthermore, it takes a excruciatingly long time to actually gain new skills or master a class, and most of the classes are unfun (a entertainer's sole job is to hit a key which caused him/her to dance on screen), or require endless monster kills to gain a single small bonus. For a newbie, this game is hell. For a casual gamer, it is frustrating. For a powergamer, it can be occasionally rewarding"
2,"A New Hope, NOT!","I bought this game with great expectations for a mmorpg to finally ""get it"". It looks like they pushed out this product to sell a name and not a game. I stopped playing this game after a month."
1,A ruined game.,"This used to be a great game then the CU came along and ruined. Those that support it probably never spent much time outside of a cantina, so know no difference. A few good changes were made, but overall the game is not any fun anymore. Also the new changes forces players to group to kill anything worth more then 1xp."
1,Star Wars Galaxies - ruined by 28 April 2005 Upgrade,"I've been playing 4 accounts for almost a year. Star Wars was a whole world experience, where one could do more than simply fight. The latest upgrade has ruined the experience for me. They have changed it into a game like all the other MMPORGs out there. I played Star Wars BECAUSE of the differences. Changing Star Wars into a ""sci-fi"" version of EQ2 or WoW has taken away all the reasons I loved the game -- most notably being able to immerse myself in a whole world, not just a game.Do yourself a favor and play World of Warcraft or a first-person shooter game if that's how you want to play. Sony Online Entertainment has ignored its user base with these changes. Four accounts cancelled."
2,"A good game, gone bad","This was a game that had quite a lot of potential, that was completely botched by its creatores, oh sure, its not that bad of a RPG, the problem is, it feels absoloutely NOTHING like star wars... no vehicles... no spaceships... its supposedly near impossible to become a jedi (can't confirm this one, they didn't have jedi in the beta at all), not to mention the game was NOWHERE NEAR completion at the end of the beta... basically they did a early release on a very sloppy incomplete product that should have been in beta for another 3-6 months..... and will try to pass off the features that should have been into the original release in expansion packs... sure, a lot of people will by this, simply because it has the name ''star wars'' but I bet you this game loses at least HALF of its subscribers after their free month..."
1,If youve seen one...,"Read anyone of the vet reviews who have played SWG for over a year like I have.. with 3 accounts.. and youve read them all. Everything they all say I would say about the new CU, so I have very little to add. Its all true, the game is now ruined, not that it was a very good one to begin with, having seen very little improvements and no bug fixing in the year I have played. Save your money and play something else like Guild Wars or World of Warcraft."
1,Star Wars Galaxies,"cause this game was different than oll of them, but now is some rubbish copy, which brings millions of new annoying bugs and a total boring gameplay."
1,Combat Upgrade Ruined this game,This game used to be full of mature players. The combat system was not an exercise in who could click the mouse fastest and generally it was fun to play.Since the combat upgrade most of the community minded players have left and the few left behind are the dregs of humanity.This game used to be five star
1,it was good but not anymore!,"Save your money people it was a great game, the most diverse I ever played. Now with the combat upgrade it's ruined."
1,You pay to Beta test,"Ever since I started playing the game I have been feeding SOE with constructive advice through the SWG Forum... There were many inbalances that needed tweaking and after 1 year and 4 months of waiting, the promised rebalance came from SOE in form as a ""Disney World patch""!!So, I am playing this ""new version of SWG"".... bug infested, special effects that look like from out of Donald Duck and the sound is ""numb""(as if my speakers were being choked in a very deep dungeon by a ""Combat Upgrade Nuna""). After a few days of playing, I had enough and cancelled my SWG accounts.Advice: Only play SWG if SOE enlists you into their payroll as a beta tester. To pay SOE a monthly fee to play this game is insane.I would recommend World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, and EverQuestII instead of Star Wars Galaxies... It's a ""No-brainer""."
2,Not much to do,"This was my first online RPG and I enjoyed the game a lot for the first two months. The reason I enjoyed it in the beginning was the fact that it was Star Wars and it was fun to play online with my friends. But once that wore off, I started to look for something to do. I joined a guild, bought a house, went to all the planets, and played many professions, but after that (that was the end of my second month) I found there wasn't a lot to do. Don't get me wrong the graphics are great, but there is no goal, no direction, and no overall storyline to feel like you are a part of the Star Wars universe. The other thing that made me cancel my account was the bad promises. Player cities, creature mounts, and vehicles were all suppose to be implemented with the launch. They wanted to get the game out early so the postponed these a ""few months"" Almost three months later none of these are in the game yet. I wouldn't even expect all three to be out even by the end of the year!"
1,The CU,"This used to be a great game, original, entertaining and diverse.Now it is just a shell of every other game out there, except full of bugs. Save your money on this one, perhaps go with World of Warcraft, or FFXI. atleast those ones work well"
1,Don't waste money on a 2nd rate knockoff of WoW.,"LucasArts and Sony Online Entertainment recently changed this game radically with what they called a ""combat upgrade"". Despite the fact that the beta testers (like me, ""alexi123"") and many live-server testers said that they hated it (more than 80% negative feedback), SOE and LA shoved it down our throats.All the negative responses were deleted from their forums, and all responses from the companies have been to the tune of, ""give it a try"".We have tried it. We tested it as hard as we could. We told you it <EXPLETIVE DELETED>. You didn't listen. Now players are quitting in scores.This game is no longer ""Star Wars Galaxies"", it's a combination of EverQuest 2 and World of Warcraft. Don't waste your time or money here, buy WoW instead. At least Blizzard games listens to the feedback of their customers."
1,"""Move along, move along""","Game is broken, support is non-existent, Star Wars deserves a better MMO. In-depth content is not there, unless you consider a few lines of text of some interest.Grab a Star Wars book, or go watch the movies again...you are better off."
1,Good game gone bad...,"I began playing SWG in the Beta period of late 2002. The game began as a great, original and diverse experience. As of April 28th, 2005, the core game that was Star Wars Galaxies no longer exists. I do not recommend this or any other product put out by Sony Online Entertainment. Save some money and time by passing over this game. Maybe try Guild Wars as an alternative."
1,SOE has killed SWG...,"The Dev team for SWG hasn't listened to the player community since beta. The CU was ill concieved, inadequately tested, imbalanced, and loaded to the live servers after SOE's own poll showed that over 80% of the player base wouldn't recommend SWG to a friend.Way to go SOE...you've managed to alienate the people who pay your salaries."
1,horrible!!!!!,The monthly fees are horrible why cant you play it for free??? you've already spent so much on the game
1,I really tried to like it...,"SWG is currently like an exquisitely carved toy box encrusted with gems. It is beautiful to look at, large enough to hold tons of wonderful toys, and even the lid opens well. Unfortunately this toy box only contains two small rubber balls, a handful of blocks that all have the same letters on them, a small pile of various broken toys with sharp edges, and quite a lot of dust and cobwebs.It breaks your heart to see how many things in SWG are done so right such as the graphics, animation, and even the powerful interface, yet see so many things done poorly. Many months after release much of the sparse content is still buggy or broken. The monthly story arcs are flat and unimaginative. Everything in the game requires tedious and repetitious behavior with little variety between low level and high level content. The galactic civil war is a joke.Lastly, it just isn't Star Wars.Maybe given another year or two this game will be worth paying a monthly fee for."
2,"Boring Waste of Time, but otherwise well done","This game has some good points, but overall I feel it has been boring and a waste of my time.GOOD POINTS:The highlight of this game is character creation... building a character and changing his or her appearance is fun. Also, there is no lag and the game works well technically.BAD POINTS:Boring. I've played about 30 hours worth of uninteresting missions and messed around with my equipment and I'm still bored. Maybe if a person was retired or otherwise wealthy and not working, such a person could play it for a few thousand hours and finally find something in the game to get excited about... If you are looking for excitement -- this is probably not the game for you. Dull, boring, a bit of a letdown.Sorry, I really love Star Wars. I enjoyed Jedi Outcast and Knights of the Old Republic. But Star Wars Galaxies, I'd return it if I could."
3,starwars and sony,lucas pulled its contract with sony and now the servers for the game are ENDING december 2011...as much fun as this game was its now coming to an END. not sure why the game is still being sold on the market when people will buy and afew months later the server close for good.
2,Waist of time and money,"Sure this game is fun at first you pay 15 bucks get 2 months before having to pay again, then it sux 15 dollars a month for a game that get so boring after th 5th week due to a lack of content, LOTS OF GRINDING i meen who wants to spen a weekend grinding taylor? There is no content whatsoever except for the theme parks which are a buch of lame stupid missions that never seem to end. ALso this game lags.... and it lags real bad...There are so many bugs, i fell like im paying for a beta, ive jsut been accpeted into the jtl beta if this sucks i am cancelling my swg account i advise every one to do the same or if you havnt got the game yet go buy a good fps like {EDITED}"
1,Sony should give me my money back!,"I wonder what we are buying the executives at Sony and Lucas. You shell out [item price] and then they ask for [more every] month just to play the game. After ""experiencing"" the Star Wars world, I took my copy to a used game shop and got $4 back. The price isn't the only thing wrong with it either. The interface would take a PhD to learn. With all of the pop ups and clumsy radial menus that they throw at you it's a wonder that you can do anything at all. I'm going to go play Donkey Kong on my Atari, ""Live long and prosper!"""
1,Save your money,"After playing this game since release, I would suggest that you save your money and look elsewhere for an enjoyable game experence. The software is full of bugs, which leads to frustration instead of fun. Support is terrible, an we will have the new version out soon so you can pay another 50 bucks to have the bugs repaired in this release. Shame Shame on them."
1,A very poor effort on behalf of Sony and Lucasarts,"I'd originally played this game when it first came out and, although buggy, it offered a very complex system that was quite unique in its day; unfortunately, this game has been completely re-written from the ground up and can no longer be recognized.The servers are empty and every third person is a Jedi - remember that from the movies? - and worst of all, it's become primarily a ham-fisted first-person MMO wannabe. I checked and discovered that Sony applied a 'Combat Upgrade' and 'New Game Enhancement' patch, but these can't be turned off; so unlike the original trilogy, there will be no, new hope. If you're looking for an MMORPG of the science fiction persuasion, I'd reccomend anything else - even some of the free ones like AO or Eve - this simply isn't worth it anymore. :("
2,Not as versatile as you'd think,"While it does an excellent job of keeping your bum awake, this Silver Bullet is surprisingly ineffective at deterring werewolves. Buyer beware!"
1,awful,"Never having used Prismacolor soft pastels, I can't say whether it is the product generally or just the batch I got.... but these are awful. They crumbled to dust under the lightest pressure. After a few feeble attempts to make marks without creating a PILE of dust and cracked pieces, i ended up smashing them all to bits, adding some binder, and custom mixing my own colors. I ended up with about 6 usable pastels! wow. i am guessing/ hoping that perhaps the batch i got were mistreated in someway prior to arrival.... Prismacolor products are usually superb."
4,An essential course in game theory.,"This was one of the first books I read in Game Theory, and definitely the hardest. Those who want a gentle introduction to the concepts of modern game theory might do better with a simpler text such as Gibbons. That said, there is no substitute for quality. The depth of analysis is entirely necessary to get to the meat of the theory.Osborne and Rubinstein write extremely well, softening the blows of some of the more complicated concepts. Their own substantial publication records in the Game Theory literature do much to recommend their version of analysis over others."
2,Maybe for class but not for personal exploration...,"I agree with a previous review that this book is not good for individuals. Solutions to the excersizes are only available to educators. If the book is assigned for a class and the teacher has access to the solutions and can coach the student through the excersizes this is probably a great book because of it's depth. It is probably also a good reference book for those already familar with the subject.However if you are like me and were looking for a strong book that will help a motivated individual learn game theory this book is not for you. I have tried many of the excersizes and I am still not positive that I my answers are correct. The material in the book is very complex but accessible, that is not the problem. The problem is the lack of development because I can not go over my answers to the excersizes and see what I did right and what I did wrong..."
3,Not as good as Osborne's solo effort,"Ten years after this good came out, Osborne wroteAn Introduction to Game Theory, a more comprehensive and focused book that also takes a more leisurely pace and provides more concrete problems. Some have said that this book is better suited to graduate students, while ""An Introduction"" is more appropriate to undergrads. Speaking as someone who's taken game theory at both an undergraduate and graduate level, I don't see any advantage to this book in either context. It is concise, yes, but it is also dense and suffers from the authors' disagreements over several fundamental issues.If you are looking for an advanced textbook in game theory, then I'd strongly recommend Ken Binmore's recent effort,Playing for Real. It's wide-ranging and rich in challenging problems."
3,A Decent Survey,"This book is a decent alternative to the Gibbons text (which I personally prefer). You could say this book is much more comprehensive and much more mathematical than Gibbons, though. My own opinion is that much of the game theory as described in this book is not general audience and sometimes very tedious if you are only interested in theory and not so much interested in real analysis.If you find Gibbons to be too easy or way below your level, this book is one option. The more ideal option, though, would just be to start reading academic papers - as you are obviously ready to do so. That way you could get the knowledge first hand and wouldn't need to spend time on a very detailed second hand review of areas that may not be exactly what you are looking for."
4,Outstanding bluegrass album with new sound.,"Don't be put off by the fact that there is a drummer on this album----this is solid bluegrass with a new sound. Scott Vestal's banjo playing highlights this super album, but vocals, choice of materials, and fiddle are outstanding as well. It's one I've listened to over and over and still haven't gotten tired of it. Highly recommended."
3,It's better when made in the pressure cooker!,"We had bought quite a few packages because my husband wanted a quick Italian soup. When I first made it as per the directions, the beans didn't quite cook all the way and had quite a bit of crunch to them yet. It didn't get finished off the night we made it because of it, I ended up throwing it out because it was going nowhere in it's leftover life. Since we had a couple of packages left, I was going to give them away in the food drive. Using my pressure cooker one day for something else, I decided to use the soup mix in that and see if it helped soften the beans like they should be. Wouldn't you know it, after 10 minutes cooking it in the pressure cooker; I'd have to say that it is absolutely amazing! I think it's as good as my Italian husband's home cooked. Try it, you'll agree."
5,Got over the ingredients and I like this soup.,"I used 2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth and 3 cups of water. I added browned, chopped, sweet Italian sausage and an extra can of white beans. It was a rich hearty soup that my family really enjoyed. It took me some time to get past the ingredients but I am happy I did. Served with a nice salad, this soup is still better than anything I would get at a fast food restaurant. This is great for a satisfying meal in a hurry.11/8/12I tried this again. This time I cooked my own beans, added the sausage, chicken broth, water, two cups of chopped kale and the soup mix. It was a rich hearty soup, with a creamy texture from the home cooked beans.. The additional ingredients and water made enough for 6 big bowl servings and it wasn't salty."
5,Great Soup!,"This is a hearty stand-alone soup that makes a complete meal, though it's still more delicious with hearty ploughman's bread on the side. Of course, you can always slice in polish sausage or cooked Italian sausage and it feeds many more hungry mouths."
5,Hide the Package from Company,"Totally unexpected from a packaged mix. This brings Italy into your kitchen, but if your guests come in also, then simply hide the package and pretend you have an Italian housekeeper. Add the olive oil and cheese as they suggest and you will have a magnificent ""homemade soup."" The six-pack brings the price below those in cans and you will marvel at the difference. Buon appetito."
5,Hubby's read:,My husband has given Mark Billingham's work 5 stars for keeping him (my husband) glued to the page. He has already ordered more of the Tom Thorne series.
3,So So,"The plot just doesn't live up to its promise. As I've written elsewhere, I've enjoyed several of Billingham's novels. I find him to be a good writer who can craft believable thrillers. This is a good example of his work -- solid characterization, decent plot, and a maddeningly simplistic writing style. With more expansive prose, he might be able to join the ranks of Rankin, Pelecanos, and Connelly."
3,Not his best work,"These two movies are decently funny, but not in a witty way. Rowan Atkinson is really a comic genius, and in his earlier English comedy routines and TV appearances, you see a totally different person. ""Bean"" as a movie adaptation is OK, but if you've seen the show, the jokes are basically just recycled and overused. ""Johnny English"" was funny to me as a teenager, but that was before I had seen Atkinson's stand-up comedy and the Bean show. It was a commercial failure and poorly-rated, as ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"".For the price you get two average comedies (Bean is a funnier character), but it isn't his best offering."
5,Double Feature Beans,Two for the price of one! Neither movie particularly great - although there are plenty of laughs. Bean does better in short vignettes. But the price can't be beat!
5,A great Rowan Atkinson two-fer at a great price!!!,"This is a great way to get BOTH Bean-The Movie and Johnny English in one great DVD package,and it's got a cheap price tag too,much cheaper than buying the 2 DVD's seperately!!! Classic British comedy!!! A+ (Note though,I'm sure in the future a Franchise Collection will eventually be available that will include Mr. Beans Holiday too,not exactly sure,but we all know by now how the DVD companies are,but for now we got this collection to enjoy!) Still Recommended!!!"
3,Strange But Fun,"I have to say that these movies are not what i expected. I Will say that they are still fun to watch, and I am glad I did not pay to see these in the theater."
1,Last 15 minutes doesn't play; dvd looks warped,"I bought this for my son, who has reported that approximately the last 15 minutes of the Mr. Bean DVD will not play at all. He also said that the disk looks like it may be warped, like it was water-damaged."
2,Not enough rocker,"Neither my wife nor I really liked this knife. The knife doesn't really have any ""rocker"", making it hard to cut through the bottom crust of a tough-crusted loaf.As we already had another bread knife (a Wusthof) without much rocker, we ended upreturning this one.(Yes, we're probably just overly picky. The knife seemed to be quite well made,especially considering the price. And it was definitely sharp.)"
4,Three-way studio jamming session,"Recorded days after the wonderful Blue Train album, this session brought together an unusual cast of players. John Coltrane, Paul Quinichette and Frank Wess on tenor saxophone (with Wess doubling on flute), Mal Waldron running the show on piano, Doug Watkins on bass and Art Taylor on drums.Probably the most interesting material on this album are the two takes of Waldron's ""Wheelin'"", a fast romp which provides a battleground for a three-way tenor tussle. Waldron takes an extended solo in his Monk-like awkward but bluesy style, which either does it for you or doesn't.It's a shame this was released under Coltrane's/Wess' name since it's really Mal Waldron's set and material and probably not in the taste of most Trane lovers, but still worth checking out."
1,Horrible,"I can't comment on the content of the DVD because it wont even play on my Xbox. My console plays all other DVDs perfectly fine, but this one continually causes it to pause to load, making it impossible to get through even 3 minutes of the first lesson. I'm sure the guy's a good guitar player but buy at your own risk if you're planning on running it in a Xbox 360."
3,Juno And The Hitchcock,"Well, first off, this rating should be around 3 and 3/4 stars instead of just three. Hitchcock films the Sean O'Casey play just as it is. It is one of the first in a tradition of Hitchcock filmed plays. This tradition is that since the play was written for the stage and works best that way, why change the locales and ""open"" the play up as filmed versions of the play often do? Rope and Dial M For Murder are Hitchcock's greatest examples of this art. Juno and the Paycock is not the best of Hitch's films, but the actors are very good and the story is very interesting. It also shows Hitchcock's continuing transition to sound from just one year earlier. It is definitely worth checking out and is not great, perfect Hitchcock, but good Hitchcock showing his ability to utilize the fresh new sound technology in rather entertaining dialogue. It is worth a look."
2,"Poor Transfers, get the Laserdiscs!","It is sad that the excellent Laserdiscs mastered from 35mm film transfers of JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK & BLACKMAIL have not yet made their way to DVD. When you watch the razer sharp, good contrast & well framed laserdiscs, you wonder what went wrong over the years to produce these awful DVDs.If you do not own a laserdisc player you may want to be patient and wait until someone like Lionsgate/Studio Canal release these titles. They have released other Alfred Hitchcock British National movies."
1,Do not buy this set !,I bought this set a month ago and was amazed to discover that the handles rust very easily ! I usually really like Calphalon stuff but these knives suck. Do not buy.
1,Disappointed by Calphalon steak knives,"I chose this set of knives because of the Calphalon name (I love my cookware!), German steel use, and the description, ""Hygienic fiberglass-reinforced poly resin handle will not absorb moisture, crack, split, or chip."" I was disappointed to find that one of the sets I ordered was already showing signs of rust -- even though the set was unused and delivered in a ""sealed"" box, all four handles had rust marks."
5,Excellent reference,"This is a wonderful reference. Technical where needed, but useful for a novice willing to learn the features of a bolete. My only wish would be for a pocket edition suitable for the field."
5,North American Boletes,"Since boletes are my favorite mushroom, I loved this book. It contains hundreds of wonderful full color photographs and helped me refine some of my previous identifications that had been incorrect when based on other references. If you are a serious bolete fan, this is a must-have."
3,Not Quite as portrayed,"The book is a large well documented book, however for the novice like myself there is too much technical terms, and not enough practical information. For example there were 5 pages devoted to ""collecting, cooking, and preserving"" out of some 400 pages. If you are into this for a college degree, you may be more pleased than myself, but I was looking for lots of color identification pictures, and more layman's terms of information."
1,definitely for a V8 engine,I wish I saw the reviews before buying. Was definitely not for my 4 cylinder. Side of box said it was for a V8 Jeep.
1,It does not fit my car!,Ordered it for 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse v6. It does not fit this car. It looks like it is for some kind of V8 car......
1,"Maybe a fluke, but mine was TERRIBLE. Threw it out.","Got this as a gift. Few months later, I found myself tossing it into the dumpster including the hot mess of ""dinner"" inside it that it managed to turn to puree, again.-I am sure mine was defective, but still you need to know this. Mine looked promising - this nice red shiny crock pot. Programmable times and settings. Oh how pretty.-It was garbage. I tried using it several times, and each time, it cooked the hell out of my dinner. It always smelled like burning rubber when in use, and I could never find the source or fix it. Everything I cooked in it (usually on low) cooked WAY WAY WAY too fast and ended up being disgusting. The last dish was the last straw: it turned this gorgeous chicken noodle dish into something that looked like wallpaper paste in under 3 hours on low. Unacceptable. Going forward, I'll never trust ""Rival"" again. To me, Rival = cheap. Buyer beware."
4,Crock Pot/Slow Cooker,We have found this product to be of high quality both in it's construction and it's performance. We would highly reciommend it toanyone needing such an ppliance.
3,Great Crock-pot With a Design Flaw,"This is a beautiful and serviceable appliance. However, the second time I used it the hinge on the lid broke off. Instead of returning the pot I removed the hardware and now have two vent holes in the glass lid."
2,Worked great...for one day,"I purchased this item because it was rated highly by several independent reviewers and I liked the feature that allows the cooking time to be chosen in increments of 30 minutes. But when I initially plugged in the slow cooker, it smelled like burning electrical wires. My husband assured me that it was just the typical ""new item"" smell and not to worry. I did notice a bit of smoke coming from the electrical panel area and it seemed to me that the outside of the slow cooker was hotter than it should have been (very warm to the touch). But it seemed to cook the first meal okay so I thought that must just be the way it was. When I plugged it in today (second day of owning it), the electrical panel lights flashed, but it wouldn't allow me to select a heat setting or time. Basically, it was fried. I am sending this back for a refund and will be looking for a different slow cooker instead."
2,Still unfinished,"Just fair warning for any who dont have the patience to put up with the new launch of a MMORPG.The game is still very very unstable as of this date 4/21/03. Frequent crashes and severe lag, memory leaks are all to be expected if you try playing this game now. Can spend more time trying to actually log into game then playing."
1,"Shadowbane is soooo buggy, no customer support",Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game. I have been unable to register the CD key and therfor cannot even play this game. Also to agree to the terms of agreement I had to change the resolution of my computer just to reach the button.Ubi will probably sucker more people in though.
5,The Best PvP Game Out There,This is the best game out there for people who want their own cities and for people who want to destroy other people's cities. The release was much better than I expected and the devs have been much more active in the community than I've seen in other games. The lvls are much easier to get than in the other mmorg I've played. If you can find a guild to join you'll enjoy a lot.
1,Can you say absolute failure,"Initial release of game is a complete failure. Nobody can even log-into the game or sign up an account. Regretfully I bought the game because they have been in beta for so long I figured it would be ready, but lol, no such luck. Remember how poor the initial stages of Anarchy Online were; well, this is just as bad. UBI-Soft will lose their shorts over this one."
3,A much improved game,I really liked this game and I'm not exactly a video game enthusiast! I think it's really important to explore new toys and this is a very good game.
1,"Shadowbane - big hype, nothing delivered","I followed the development of Shadowbane for years. I loved the concept and waitedr an eternity it seemed for the game to come out. Unfortunately, to my dismay, the game fell very short from the hype and is on its way down the drain.Constant lag issues, unbalanced characters classes, dated graphics, no lore and no depth make this game a deffinate ""do not buy"". The only thing this game had going for it, PvP, was designed terribly and the Guild vs Guild warfare is a joke with the constant crashing and lag.Save yourself the money and misery that thousands of people went through giving this game a chance. Buy something else."
1,Not ready for Beta,"When I first read the hype on this game I became excited. With so much to offer Shadowbane sounded like the next generation MMORPG. It's not. Shadowbane does not need to be released to beta to find problems. Lag, poor graphics and the horrid interface makes me wonder how it got to beta let alone a retail self. You will need a lot more then the recommended system for this game. Even with cable, 8x APG/128DDR and 2gig of ram, good luck. I get no lag playing DAOC even in RvR with Zerg's galore. Shadowbane is a step backward from current available games. If you can't take the game back like I did, don't buy it."
4,Almost a good game-Buyer beware.,"I posted the following on the official forum. The login system is currently broken, and has been since release. Should this condition change I will repost here.----------------------Maybe they could release a program that automatically tried to login to the server every few minutes, then inform me with some .wav file that it had actually logged in.Something like a Homer Simpson, 'Yahoo!'Or Han Solo from Star Wars. ""I have a bad feeling about this.""Maybe something adapted from South Park. ""I created the perfect game, with one login server, and five asses.""I expect a game to function at minimum levels after release, but I do expect it to function. Four days owning this game, two days actually able to play it. Every day I spend more than an hour trying to login, I expect them to add that to the end of my subscription, for failing to provide the service I am paying for.Advertising a service, and then not delivering that service, is fraud."
2,Shadowbane,Probably the worst online game I've played to date. I have played for 3 weeks now and have cancelled my subscription. Graphics are quite dated and lagg at times makes it unplayable. Oh and I cant forget the server crashes although less frequent now they still occur. Skip this title and buy something else
1,Registration is impossible,"The game might be nice. If you could actually play it. The problem is, in order to play, you have to create an account and subscription through Ubi Soft. The process for doing so is buggy, unstable, and - worst of all - unsupported. You can only get support for Shadowbane through the Shadowbane support site, but you can't get into that site until you have an active subscription. So if you're having problems getting that subscription, you're SOL.Yeah Shadowbane sounds cool, but until Ubi Soft gets their act together, go play something that won't make you pull your hair out before you even create a character. It's just not worth the aggravation."
2,Shadowbane - Trial,"After having experienced some nasty behavior from UBI before, I decided to download the free trial from their website before actually purchasing the full version of this game.I'm glad I did.The graphics are old, my computer and drivers are not, and even as a trial this game was a disapointment. Once the avatar was created, the progression was boring. I felt like I was playing the original PS version of Diablo all over again.No thanks - I've moved beyond that stage.The premise - the political manouvers that are possible with on-line play, and the interaction of the characters, is fantastic. The reality just isn't."
1,Playing solo is a joke,"I thought this game was going to be fun, but it was not. It was fun in the beginning when you could actually gain level kinda fast by yourself. Soon though, you realize that gaining fast levels by yourself is an impossibility. Instead you need to get in a group and just sit around while high levels kill everything for you. Hurray what a blast. Don't buy this game."
2,So much better stuff out there,"Shadowbane, sadly, is a complete letdown. The graphics are poor, the sound is generic, and the gameplay is dull. When you start playing, you'll be pretty engrossed in the game as you quickly level-up your character. However, the problem is that there's little variety in the monsters you must kill, so it gets boring spending your time hacking spiders and snakes.The idea is, at some point you'll level up enough to join/start a guild, and begin guild wars against other players, and lay siege to their cities. Problem? Nobody bothers with this at all, they just keep leveling up. After a full month of playing, I never once saw a seige, nor heard rumor of one.Then there's the servers, which are rarely functional. You'll frequently have to jump between cities to find one that's up and running, and I recall and entire week where it was simply impossible to log in. Lag gets horrendous, even on broadband.Stick with Dark Age of Camelot or anything else."
3,Not exactly everquest...,I have been playing Shadowbane as a beta tester for the last few months. The game play and character progression are good but the lag time is frustrating. Supposedly they will be switching to a better server when the game is actually released but we'll see.
1,Why Would Anyone Buy This???,I was under the impression that Shadowbane had closed all their servers. Being a MMORPG I would think this kind of makes the game disks rather useless. I think they are working on Shadowbane II but would you need the original game disks to play that? I think not. If these disks are as useless as I think it is rather immoral to sell them as anything but a coaster. That's a pretty expensive coaster.
2,Don't bother unless you have a few dozen friends,"The game is fun, if you have a few dozen friends already ingame to watch over you. While the game protects players until level 20, you don't become viable in any of the serious combat situations until level 50. With experience, you can hit level 50 in a week; however, if you just start the game, it could take you close to a solid month.This is not a light gaming experience at all. If you're looking for an MMOG to try out just for the sake of trying it out, I suggest City of Heroes or Dark Age of Camelot. Shadowbane is ""advanced"" MMOG gaming. It requires you like hunting and being hunted by other people, at all times and in all places, and being comfortable ending the playsession further behind than where you started.That's why I gave it 2 stars. It's not a good all-around title. It's fun for a very specific type of player."
1,Not worth it if it was free,"Don't know who paid people to come here and say this is a good game. Lag, lockups, crashing servers, rollbacks of lvls and loss of equipment and gold, and MORE, that I probably shouldn't say. I have been playing games since before pong and if anyone can call this even close to release ready, they are being paid. Please just read the game forums and see what the players are saying. Yes, a large % of the people like it and have ONLY a FEW problems, but do you want to buy and pay monthly for a CHANCE that you can play or that it will get better? Many better games already here to buy."
1,Too Late the War is Over!!!,"Unfortunatly this game has been dominated by the Beta Players and guilds. UBI and WolfPack have given all the beta players a grossly unfair advantage. The object of the game is to build nations and guilds to conquer the other nations with siege and war.The reality is the UBI left the game the same after the beta and allowed the Beta guilds to split up onto every server so they would not have fight each other and could easily dominate each server from the begining.This game has been out for 1 month and all the serves have been completely over run with players who participated in the beta and have the game figured out. Most new cities are destroyed within days of creation so Nation building will only be possible except for those in the beta.You will not be able to start your own city, start a guild or do much more than level characters and maybe pk each other for lack of anything else better to do.This game is a complete waste of time, money and shipping effort if you buy."
2,"Starts off fun, ends up dull","I played this until 50th level. I was fortunate in that my server had not yet reached stagnancy. This is one of the big probs in the game. There are supposed be massive guild wars for control. There are, but eventually they end when a guild wins. And then everything gets very booooring. With only one guild in control, theres no interguild fighting. No PvP. Or if it is, it's very lopsided. The classes are well designed. I think making the disciplines a droppable, stealable item, instead of a questable item was a big mistake. It creates another chokepoint for powerful guilds to maintain control.What ends up happening is the PvP is so uncommon, that most players end up sitting around farming xp, just to have something to do. Or starting up alts. Just to have something to do. Because they can't PvP."
4,Shadowbane is no longer playable!,"Why does amazon still have this game up for sale when it is completely done with?. You can't play this game anymore, the company turned the servers off for good and for ever. This is not good marketing."
2,National Geographic Classics: Oceans,"I am totally disappointed with this purchase. I was under the impression that it was a Blu-Ray, turns out it is only on DVD. Beware before you purchase it."
1,Don't waste your money on this.,"All the figures contained in the original article are omitted from this. You do not get to see the frequency response plots, which are the only reason I paid for this. Pathetic."
2,Too small,"The pot is much smaller than I expected, and not much use. The quality is nice, but just not large enough."
1,Looks & Feels Cheap,"I'll start by saying, ""It is totally my fault"". The macbook air is an expensive, sleek, sexy, high-end laptop. I did my purchase a disservice by picking up this low-end accessory.Pros:- fit's the macbook air perfectly- soft interior won't scratch the macbook airCon:- Looks and feels very cheap (does not match the product it was designed to accompany)The concern raised above is purely cosmetic and superficial. Yet, I stand by it wholeheartedly."
1,Overpriced and poor content,There are only 2 segments in this tape. The first concerns another person creating a French Braid (using the Dutch Braid method) on a model's blond hair. The other section shows another person braiding her own hair. Save your money. My tape squeaked all the way through. There weren't enough angles used in filming the braiding process. Would suggest BRAIDING BEAUTIFUL - also available at Amazon.com as a far better choice. For a truly gorgeous braiding video BEGINNING HAIR BRAIDING taught by Karen Ribble is tops -- if Amazon can get it. I've been braiding my waist length hair for over 30 years -- and was very disappointed with this tape.
3,Personal stories mixed with entertaining garden insights.,"Inner gardening is an interesting and simple concept, but sometimes totally over stated in Growing Myself. The author's strength is in her confessional stories about her life. In what I first thought would be a soft New Agey read about talking to plants and essays about the author coming of age as a spiritual Earth Mother, turned out to be hard hitting with stories about divorce and a difficult abortion. I admire the author's courage in the telling of her personal stories mixed with entertaining garden insights."
4,great reminder of the garden-gardener interaction,"I just ran across a used copy of this book and have heartily enjoyed it. Handelsman's experiences with the remarkable presence and intelligence of plants mirrors my own. Learning to meet plants on their own terms is truly an art and such a rewarding one. Handelsman tells her experieces very simply and honestly. Anyone who has approached plants, trees and gardens as a place to grow both their own spirit and sense of community with the natural world will recognize a kindred spirit in this writer. I particularly enjoyed her focus on interacting and learning from houseplants since that opens the experience up to both urban and rural folks who want to explore interacting with plants in a deeper rather than just decorative manner. I'm thrilled to have found a simple book with simple wisdom that opens another level of love and awareness of life."
4,Hard-boiled noir from one of the masters,"I am a long-time fan of Ed McBain's. His 87th Precinct novels are superb, but it is easy to forget the great quality of his standalones. This hard-boiled novel from early in his career has trademark McBain touches: brisk efficient plotting, witty terse dialogue, and fluid nuanced prose. My only criticism is that it falls a little too perfectly into the noir framework: down and out private eye suspected in a murder who falls for the beautiful femme fatale. However, it is all done with the great McBain professionalism and polish, so accomplished for so early in his long career. It makes me miss him even more. If you have enjoyed any or all of the Hard Case Crime line, then this is one more for you to savor."
1,He's no George Lucas,A shallow 2 dimensional star wars want to be. prince Xizor is certainly no match for Darth Vader. The book was a major disappiontment.
2,Page-turner.,"A page-turner, but for all the wrong reasons. I found this book incredibly dull, and I probably scanned a good half of it, flipping the pages as fast as I could during the long, drawn-out, tedious space battle scenes. It is interesting in parts, but over-all this book is a yawner. Try Zahn's trilogy instead. Even ""Truce At Bakura"" is better than this book. Interestingly, the computer game of the same name as this book is just as bad. A cursed title, perhaps?"
5,Simply The Best!,"I think that Steve Perry is a wonderful writer and that his book, ""Shadows of the Empire"", deserves a full Five-Star Rating. This book takes place between two of Lucas' masterpieces, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Return of the Jedi"". The book starts off after Solo has been frozen in carbonite, and tells of the journeys and achievements of Skywalker and the rest of the group, who are desperately trying to get Solo back. The book also brings in a few new characters, such as ""Xizor"", criminal lord of the ""Black Sun"", and a few others whom are vitally important in making this novel such an incredible masterpiece. I hope that you consider acquiring this astonishing novel, and I suggest that all you Star Wars Fans out there get it, and get it fast."
5,The Best,I thoght this was deffinately the best book in the star wars series. I thought that this book realy had some great characters. It also tells what happens from when Han gets captured until he is freed. This is one book you will not want to miss!
5,it was action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat,i thought it should have been made instead of return of the jed
4,This explains what happened between epesodes 4 and 5,"Shadows of the empire explained what happed durind the time period between the movies ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"". I would recommend that you see those two moves before you read this book."
3,Passable Read,"Here is the untold story of the events that took place between Star Wars, Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi: a novel in which Darth Vader still lives and battles a villain as powerful and evil as himself; Prince Xizor the leader of the crime syndicate Black Sun.A passable Star Wars read, but storyline needs more depth and intrigue."
5,Great book must read.,"IF your like me and love star wars this book is a must have. It tells the story of the time between ESB and ROTJ. This books has the charcter you love and love to hate(Plus a few new ones). Very well written and keeps ture to the story line of SW. And at the end make you say to yourself, WOW all this **** happen before episode XI."
5,A Great Piece of Literature!!,"I really like this book.This is not the first or the last Star Wars book I have read, and I have liked all the ones I have read. But Shadows of the Empire is up there in the top three. It was so good that I read it in a week, which is fast, considering that I'm eleven years old. This book combined with the re-release of the movies got me into Star Wars novels again. I would recommend this book to both new and old Star Wars fans"
1,How is this person a professional writer?,"I finally stumbled across this thing in a used book store and, being a Star Wars fan, decided to read it. How on earth does this person maintain a living as a writer? This novel read like the worst pieces of fan-fiction, complete with 'arousing' scenes where Princess Leia almost gets nekkid! Hoo-ha! The writing was amateurish, and there were many scenes which seemed to serve absolutely no narrative purpose whatsoever. I almost think that the Steve Perry who was the lead singer for Journey could have produced a better book."
1,Hate This Book,I don't write synopsis of the book. I figure you can look above to see what the plot is. However this book is awful. It's supposed to be the bridge between Empire and Return. I hated Xizor and found him to be a boring villian. There are MAJOR plot holes and gaps in the book that are hard to understand. The writing of the book looks like an editor wasn't involved. I love the expanded universe of Star Wars. I just can't believe George Lucas let this book slip out like this. I don't recommend this to anyone but the intense fans that need to have the bridge. There are too many better books in the Star Wars series.
5,Awesome,"This Book is great! Luke, Princess Leia, Lando,and the droids are on a mission to save Han Solo. Meanwhile, Darth Vader wants to find Luke alive and bring him to the Dark Side. Xisor,the third most powerful beings in the dark side, wants Luke dead as part of his plot of revenge on Darth Vader."
2,"The inspiration was to sell toys, not storytell","Everyone has their beefs and loves with SW. Mine toward this book is that Xizor is too easily defeated. ONE thermal detonator destroys his whole complex? A villain with this much power doesn't seem to have very many defenses. And Dash was pathetic, a lame fill-in for frozen Han. I have the feeling, especially after seeing all the toys for Shadows being pushed, that if Dash or Xizor prove popular enough, they will be brought back. Guri is another sequel in hiding. A mediocre effort which to me proves that The Crowd loves only the same contrived plot over and over again, hating the sometimes-lame but more daring SW book efforts . . ."
5,AMAZING! NEVER A DULL MOMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an amzing story of the events that took place in between EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURN OF THE JEDI. All the characters are amazing, including new charcters such as Dash Rendar, and the characters we grew up with like Luke. There is a lot of action and for people that like a bit of romance, there are 2 or 3 chapters for you. The end is amazing too. The battle at the skyhook never has a dull moment. Buy this book today. It's worth it. May the Force be with you!!!!!"
5,Coudn't pull myself away!,This is a great book for Star Wars fans. The diolouge is good and a new villian is included! Buy!
5,A GREAT BOOK,Ton of detail and action.Shadows of the Empire takes you in to the missions of trying to get back Han Solo.It also tells you how Xizor works with Darth Vader and how Darth gets rid of him.
5,This is an awesome book!!!!!,Star Wars Shadows of th Empire is an awesome book!!! Finally there is a book about the Black Sun and this takes you right into its heart. BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Good read, but not like a Zahn novel","I most definently would read this book, but read it before any of the thrawn books because it will be a let down compared to Zahn. Definently a good book and worth reading though."
1,Cheap excuse to make money,"Well, someone finally figured out a cheap way to bring back Vader in a book. I wish someone who can actually write had thought of it. Vader did not speak like Vader would speak, the new villain Zixor was very boring, and Dash Rendar is a band-aid on the sore that is the missing Han Solo. He's only a cheap imitation. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
3,Pretty good,"I'd give this one more stars, but I expect only the best from any Star Wars book. I really did like it, but I don't think it would make a good movie.This book does an excellent job of filling in the gaps between ""Empire"" and ""Jedi""."
2,average,"I've only read 2 starwars books, and so far I'm not impressed. Vector Prime was down right awful and I jedi was ok. I read about 3 or 4 chapters of this book and couldn't go any further, it was that bad. Don't read the reviews for this book thinking you will be buying a decent book because you won't. The people here are obviously 12 year olds who have never read good books before, thus the 4 and 5 star reviews."
5,Shadows,"Good book. Not one of the more amazing stories to come out of the Star Wars storyline, but still good. It is set in between ESB and ROTJ. It is worth reading simply for the attention paid to Vader. It gives a good inside look into what he feels, thinks, wants, and goes well with the new prequels.The Prince Xizor is a little weird, and not the type of bad-guy that I enjoy. I'm sure other people thought he was great, but I would rather Vader stay in the role of the bad guy. He was original though, and made for interesting reading.The book was a fun read overall and highly recommended to Star Wars fans. All the main characters are there (except for Solo of course) along with some new ones including Dash Rendar, rogue and braggert."
4,Oneof the Nest Star Wars novelever written,Shadow of the Empire is a great read and is a most read for any Star Wars fans. A great plot and is written perfectly. You find out what happens between Empire and jedi. Maker sure you read this book.
3,Bre's,"This book does a good job setting the scene for ROTJ. It moves at a good pace, with a satisfying ending. Darth Vader has been well characterised. However, in light of the release of The Phantom Menace, Darth Vader's preconception of his own force skills in comparison to his son's are a little awry. Also, I do not believe that Leia could be taken in so easily by Xixor(whom incidently started my sistor off with naming every character in the book after a piece of platground equipment). Over all, a good read."
4,Fills the gap between the Star Wars movies very nicely.,"This was my 2nd Star Wars novel that I read, and I found this one a lot better. A very good novel, and it fills the gaping hole between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi quite well. The characters are well-developed, and the story flows excellently. It has the right dose of action, as well. The only flaw is the villains. Xizor wasn't that impressive, and him and Guri are so emotionless at times that it gets dull. Nevertheless, a very good novel."
2,What was he thinking?,"Was Steve Perry on something when he wrote this? I mean how could someone even think of killing as good a character as Dash Rendar? Maybe I should write a story and resurrect Dash. And what was he thinking getting Leia involved with this Xixor clown? We all knew Leia would eventually reject Xixor and relized her love for Han. Was the whole Xixor, Leia relationship meant to strengthen Leia and Han's relationship or what? The whole Xixor Leia ordeal was very weak and made Leia look weak too."
4,I just KNEW Anakin was in there somewhere...,"This book is still one of the best SW novels ever, even after I've read it so many times. I love how we can finally know what Vader's thinking, and I love Luke's excitement at learning new Jedi techniques-maybe he's been taking his power a little too much for granted lately, or something (see Specter of the Past for his wake-up call). Anyway, Vader's feelings toward his son are finally shown somewhere other than Return of the Jedi (the novel) and that is one of the best things the Star Wars Universe has ever done. I gave it 4 stars because Planet of Twilight and Children of the Jedi are still my favourites."
2,"Totally dull, man.","It was hella boring. I mean, we all knew that Darth Vader would never catch Luke, and that Xixor was gonna die. It was totally predictable. Save yourself the time, and money."
5,The best Star Wars book!,I think the book is great because they travel to different planets and have space battles.
2,Worst of the Star Wars novels,"Major disappointment. Can't say there were too many aspects of this novel I cared for. The characters didn't really seem like their old selves. I didn't care for the added sexual themes. (True, it's nothing graphic, but I felt it was very out of place for a Star Wars novel.) Strangely enough, the comic book mini-series was actually much better."
3,Worth reading for the Star Wars fan...,"Still readable, even though the film prequels are now complete. This book covers the time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.This one is a fairly fast read, and picks up toward the end. The ending is adequate, but seems a bit rushed. The ending space battle is too short and makes the reader feel a little shortchanged.However, the typical Star Wars fan will still want to pick this one up, as it does delve somewhat into Vader's search for Luke between Episodes V and VI."
5,Awesome =),Shadows of the Empire is an all important missing piece that connects episodes 5 and 6. It lets us know what happened and how things were able to develop in Return of the Jedi! Dash Rendar was cool to see...the whole thing was awesome. Now if only Lucas wants to make another STAR WARS after this prequel trilogy...
1,Darth Vader still #1!,"No way in the world can I believe that Xixor is as smart and cunning as Darth or Jabba. There was not enough space action or blaster showdowns as it should have. Dash Rander was okay... Xixor and Guri just plain sucked. Mr. Perry took way to many chances throughout the book to build them up for nothing. I hope they both died and never come back. As far as Darth Vader's equal, PLEASE. Not on even. Vader has been around for decades, and all of a sudden I'm supposed to think Xixor is just as ruthless? Nope. I was tricked by the bestseller thing at the top of the book. No more."
3,Pretty Good Segway,"Shadows of the Empire is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Steve Perry does a really nice job of incorporating your favorite Star Wars characters along with some new ones. The action is quite intense throughout the entire book, and the new approaches to the Star Wars saga make for good reading.Prince Xixor and the Black Sun Organization were incredible additions and were used nicely in the storyline. I would have liked to see a little bit less of the typical good vs. evil. The Star Wars movies and most of the other books always have characters that can side either way. Here, there really wasn't any of that.The storyline and all of the characters were well-developed and the plot seemed to have the usual twists and turns, loaded with action and adventure, leading up to a nice enjoyable ending. The writing style was was not overly descriptive and had a nice flow, making it an easy read. All in all, the novel was pretty adequate and fun to read."
3,Pretty good!,There is a lot of explaining in this book that helps fill in the gaps that you might have wondered about between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. I liked the new Villan Prince Xizor. If one can be made to look truly bad in the Star Wars universe with out being Darth Vador...Xizor comes close. The only thing I didn't like was how quickly and easily Xizor was defeated at the end of the book...oh well...
3,Pretty Good,"The text of the book was intresting, but what I thought was not realy that great was trying to creat another Han Solo in Dash. Did they do that because Han was in carbonate? It was real intresting on the way that they explained Darth Vader and how he did care about Luke but just the same wanted him for more power.It seemed a little weird that the Emperor couldn't tell what Xior and Darth were thinking, after all he was the most powerful man in the galaxy. I realy thought it was good but not the best and I save five and four stars for the better ones and the best."
4,"Good fill-in between episodes, plus...","I agree with the above reviewer that this is a solid rather than outstanding book. Prince Xizor is basically a solid and interesting character. It was good to share the focus with the independent crime elements in the galaxy, of which there surely must have been some, instead of focusing solely on the Rebellion and Empire. It's nice, of course, to have the time between ""Empire"" and ""Return"" filled in. One thing that stood out for me was the insight you get on Vader in this book. You get a much better feel for his place of power in the Empire, his relationship with Luke and the Emporer, and his hopes, desires, and struggles. Got a look inside that mask a bit, so to speak. Other than that, the story and writing were average science fiction of about 3 stars."
3,Dash Rendar: Han Solo in Disguise,"I read this book the week it was published, and had mixed feelings about it. First I felt that I was ripped off of four hours of my life. Just another Star Wars book. One of my friends also read the book and fully enjoyed. Suprised by his feelings, I re-read it. The second time I looked at the characterization of Dash Rendar, he is HAN SOLO. I belive that Steve Parry felt left out, his book couldn't have everyone's favorite smuggler. So he got inventive and created the crummy old Dash Rendar. Six Comics, a special apperance and a Video Game later........ Dash has gained popularity throughout the STAR WARS realm. The Outrider (his ship) had a cameo apperance in Special Edition, and his computer game has sold thousands of copies. Han doesn't even have a game."
1,One of the Worst books I've ever read. Period.,"I found this book horribly written, full of shallow and stereotypical characterizations. All the characters you've grown to know and love are reduced to paper cut-outs spewing meaningless lines that seem like something the might say but wouldn't. The story is slow moving, but completely lost in the bad writing and weak protrayal of the key characters. It reads like a book written by someone who has had little experience and only a passing knowledge of the characters and events of the Star Wars universe.I cannot pan this book enough. The bigger fan you are of Star Wars, the more you'll hate this book."
4,nice read,this book is a really nice fill in between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If stays true to the characters in the SW universe and is an enjoyable read.
5,An all around winner!,"I am an avid reader of Star Wars books and this was deffinately one of the best ones I've ever read. With the absence of Han, Dash Rendar adds an interesting twist in the plot. The end though was a bit weak when Dash was supposed to be such a hot pilot but he seems to slam into a piece of space trash. I know in the game he doesn't but oh well, it's a must have for any collection."
5,All I can say is....WOW!!!,"What a great book!Xizor is DEFINATELY the BEST star wars villain.The chapters about him are the most interesting in the book(Mr. Perry gives a good amount of attention to the regular characters,but the DETAIL(!!!) he gives Xizor is worthy of the best science writers...and that he is.)The idea of Darth Vader having a rival behind the scenes was very clever.I just wish we knew what happened to Guri(the human-replica droid).A great page-turner worth three times its price!So if you like Star Wars,or even if you don't really like it,you'll LOVE this book!(though be warned,there are some racy and/or suggestive passages)"
3,Hype is the word of the day,"I have to admit that I put off reading this book, until the hype wore down. But once I read it, I couldn't figure out what all the hype was about. This book was honstly, well average. The idea of the Black Sun was phenominal, the character development was, as usual, poor."
2,REDUNDANT,"I lasted through 40 pages or so of this novel. The concept sounded interesting; a rival vs Darth Vader for the affections of the Emperor. But the problem is that the concept wasn't fully mined nor not even partially enough to make it interesting enough. Furthermore, every other chapter jumped to the Star Wars characters in which they rehashed stuff from the movies just like the crime lord character who was opposed to Vader. I get that he hates Vader but do I have to hear it for pages and pages of internal thoughts? Moreover, half of what Vader and the Emperor talk about is . . . wait for it . . . from the movies! No thank you. WHEN READ: January to February 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C minus."
3,Better of the Star Wars books,"The books will never live up to the movies. But of those that are worthy of note, Shadows of the Empire is truly one of them. Prince Xizor is an excellent villain, and he serves as Vader's nemesis quite well. This book does a great job in filling that missing time period between Empire and Jedi. It's a good adventure, worth a reading, or two...or even three."
3,This book was OK,"I thought it was OK... but it was boring. I tried my best to read the whole book but I couldn't cause it was too boring. Sorry, man, but this book wasn't exiting. Cya"
4,SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE,"IT WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT THEY TRIED TO DRAW TO MANY THINGS TOGETHER AND ADD TOO MUCH TO THE STORY FOR ONE BOOK. WITH A LITTLE EFFORT, IT COULD HAVE BEEN TWO VERY INTERESTING NOVELS THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN EMPIRE STRIKES BACK AND RETURN OF THE JEDI."
4,On Pointe,"On Pointe is a novel-in-verse book written long poem form. This book is for the most part an easy read. You wont want to put it down. This book shows the life of a girl named Clare and her dream of becoming a member of the City Ballet Company.Clare is faced with different problems between her parents, and the kids fighting for the same spot she is. This book is for anyone who enjoys dance or just reading about a girl who is trying to live out her dream."
4,"""Pointe"" and Flex","A hopeful ballerina named Claire discovers that she may be considered too tall to pursue her dream. This book details grief, eating disorders, and family matters, all realistically explained. Most importantly, it is all conveyed with a sense of hope.The novel is written in verse and flows as eloquently as the classical music Claire dances to, with a steady rhythm and pacing. All of the scenes that take place in a rehearsal studio and on stage feel incredibly real. The author herself was a dancer for years, and you can tell.I recommend On Pointe by Lorie Ann Grover to fans of A Dance of Sisters by Tracey Porter, Dancing in Red Shoes Will Kill You by Dorian Cirrone, and A Time for Dancing by Davida Wills Hurwin. Younger readers might also like The Sisters Impossible by J.D. Landis."
4,Where the fun is,"Clare is a dancer. She wants to join the City Ballet, but she's taller than most professional dancers. Can she make it? If she can't, what will she do? On Pointe examines what happens when our dreams change. Clare begins the summer auditioning for the City Ballet, living with her grandfather, and chatting with her friend Rosella, who says negative things about their peers that make Clare uncomfortable. By the end of summer, Clare's perspective and priorities have undergone a dramatic shift.Lorie Ann Grover's verse beautifully conveys the work, pain, and pride that come with being a dancer, as well as the self-consciousness and alienation we feel as our bodies change us from children to adults. Clare learns that our passions don't have to be our professions. This is a valuable lesson for anyone, but it is especially valuable for readers who are passionate about one art or another.I would recommend On Pointe to fans of dance, poetry, or readers struggling to define themselves."
1,Hated it! - Check out Ballet Friends instead,"Yuck! The terrible free verse or whatever style is so hard to read. When I got to the depressing part, I closed it and donated it to my library. Such a downer. Anybody who likes ballet should check out Ballet Friends: Get to the Point! Its so much better, and funny, and a real feel-good book. Who wants to be depressed? Take my advice and buy Ballet Friends instead."
5,Outstanding tour-de-force,"Dr. Armentano's book is remarkable and indispensible. Since it it short, do not expect it to be an all-inclusive study of the entire past, present, and future of antitrust law. It is simple, straightforward logic that is often missing when analyzing complex legal problems - even from most economic work in the field.Antitrust: The Case For Repeal looks closely at the Microsoft case and uses it almost allegorically to condemn the entire practice of antitrust law in the United States. He showcases the inherent contradictions, the arbitrary law, and the self-defeating nature of antitrust legislation. His scholarship is impeccable and the writing is smooth. This book should be a tremendous resource for any research done in the field and also excellent intellectual reading for anyone interested in a common-sense approach to antitrust."
3,OK for the price,"Despite what some reviewers say, there is a very obvious difference in the gauge and quality of metal used in this pan and the All-Clad roasters. The difference is obvious if you compare them head to head in person, which I did today. That said, this is still a good price on these, and the quality is most likey adequate for most users.As for where they're made, I was told that all the All-Clad roasting pans are made in Korea now. The Calphalon, and every other pan you'll see out there (except Le Creuset), is made in China. In the end, the better quality of the All-Clad won me over. But check for yourself."
1,Big Words are useless in making a message clear,"I purchase this book only because it was required reading material for a course I am taking. The worst book by far I ever had to read. The author is so fanatical about using such big words, he looses you. Then he has the gall to repeat these big words over and over again. I cannot see this book being a book for the normal reader. His premise for the book is most likely just for himself and definitely not something a person longs to know. I couldn't imagine anyone wanting to discover what he proposes to discover and prove in his book.Stay away from this book. You would learn more by doing a crossword puzzle."
5,shes great,I bought this for my mom for christmas and she loved it. She says they are great informative books
2,"First off, I'm not associated with any kind of religion and I consider myself open minded","But think about it, if you will. Most of the ""so-called"" Truths in this book are just religious and spiritual beliefs that have been passed on for more than centuries (reincaration, dual divinity, spirit guide, etc.), re-written to sound original and fresh. Miss Browne has been proven wrong more than once, when it comes to her psychic ability. Secondly, if she's such a ""humanitarian"" then how come she charges thousands of dollars just for a reading? I'm sorry. I'm not convinced."
1,Disappointing!,"This is a JUNK tie. Don't order it. It's made of a REALLY cheap cloth that looks terrible, with lots of little white ""whiskers"" poking through the front of the burgundy ""silk."" I immediately returned this tie. What irks me most is that I had to pay for postage both ways, plus insurance and delivery confirmation, just to find out what a piece of garbage this tie actually is. Amazon should not carry this product."
2,Cute but motor never worked,"I purchased this toy rottweiler last Christmas as a gift for a friend to his a rottweiler fanatic -- unfortunately right out of the box the motor was broken and so the breathing motion never worked correctly -- or at all. Nonetheless, she likes the puppy."
3,Good game but repetitive and too easy,"This is a great game with great graphics, but it's easy compared to older MMOs like Everquest so there are a lot of kiddies who think they are ""uber"" because they are playing a really easy game. But it's a fun game nontheless until you realize that even at lvl 70 you are getting the same kinds of repetitive quests as lvl 1."
2,Ok but WHAT FOR!!!!!!,The idea is cool. The game is well thought-out. I stopped playing because I was doing the same thing over and over again...just got boring.The game is addictive...but just wasn't for me.
4,Great game but Game Stop expedited delivery faulty,"This review is posted re: Game Stop's delivery service. I ordered the game on the 16th Expedited 1-3 days. It's now the 23rd. I called customer service who were helpful & offered to credit the shipping charge. However, they told me The game would not be delivered until the 25th. As I wanted to play the game I just went out to a local Game Spot & picked it up for $29.99 & no $10 shipping charge.The game is a lot of fun btw. It's like a melding of Baldurs Gate and Warcraft. Lots of quests, a little slow in the movement dept. Things take a long time to accomplish. I suppose once I get a mount it will speed up. The whole create your own item idea is pretty cool. I recommend this game if you like running quests. If you're a hack & slash Diablo fan I don't know if they'll ever make another game like that."
2,"Bad Server, Bad Customer Support, Unplayable at Times","The game itself is good if you dont mind the servers crashing for hour(s) almost every day. During those times the servers constantly go down and takes anywhere from an hour up to 24 hours for the servers to go back up. After the server is up your character might be rerolled back x amount of time meaning you lose all experience, items gold found during that rollback interval. In the last 3 days of playing my character has been rolled back 3-4 times. I talked to one of blizzards support people and they said they couldnt do ANYTHING about the lost experience, items or gold caused by their server crash. In short, if you dont mind bad customer support, bad servers then go right ahead and buy this game.I've played on two seperate servers and they both had these issues."
2,Monthly fee?,"As a Mom that does not know games that well, I don't think Amazon was very clear in their write-up about the product. You must sign up and pay $15 a month just to play the game. I hear it is a great game, but we returned it."
3,Great.. for a while.,"This game starts out refreshing, and awesome. The combat systems are easy to follow... The quests and tradeskills are easy to follow.. Progression, overall, is easy.. And that's where it starts to get not so much fun anymore. You can basically solo almost the entire game, and that really hurts the sense of community.It's still great.. but after a few months, the charm really wore off."
3,A sad sacrifice,"I have been a Blizzard fan since Warcraft II, and must say that Warcraft is my favorite line of games. World of Warcraft was an awesome game, but sadly, Blizzard's chain of command between the Developers and the Community Managers was horrendous to the point that I cancelled my account. They seem to be doing better now, but it's still not anywhere near Blizzard's best work."
2,Fun to Play but their server down half of the time,"This is a fun game to play. Yes, I admit that it can actually be addicting with gorgeous display and user friendly interface but Blizzard is having some serious problem maintaining their infrastructure. They keep putting out patch after patch and the program is actually getting worse. Now, I can't log in about 30% of the time. Even if I get to log in, the lag is so bad I get killed a lot. It is very frustrating since I am paying $15 to play and at least I want to be guaranteed to login and play. I now lost faith in that Blizzard will get their act together to fix the problem. I honestly think it is out of their control. Sad...."
5,Worth the wait,"I have been waiting for this games release for over a year...and after playing the open beta I know it was worth the wait. The beta is over today, and I will have to wait 4 agonizing days for the retail release before I can get back into the action. The 4 longest days in my gaming life."
1,A poor excuse for a game.,"So, I have played six or seven MMORPGs in the last 12 or so years, all of them had their own twists and turns, ups and downs, things they shined at etc. World of Warcraft on the other hand has NOTHING in-game that shines other than a huge population, and why? Blizzard is great at marketing and sucking people in. Compare the in-depth playing of a game like Anarchy Online or DAoC to the at best weak grind and quest snooze-fest that is World of Warcraft.Yes, World of Warcraft has slightly better more cartoony graphics than those games; but when did that start making a game the best?If you want to play a game that is weak on quality and in-depth gaming, then this is your game!"
1,Little fun for a ton of headaches,"I have several issues with this game. They load SPYWARE (a program called Warden) to monitor ALL the processes you are running on your computer. It digs through your address book, looks at info in your system windows, and scans all your running processes (most of which have nothing to do with them or their game.) This spyware downloads and activates at random the entire time you are playing the game. This causes lag spikes and character death with little ryme or reason.Large down times with little feedback from management, time wasted programming expansions when there are still a large number of broken gameplay elements is another problem I have with this game.I have been playing this game for a year now but would not recommend it until they fix several in game and privacy issues."
1,Bend over and take it from Blizzard,"So I tried to get into this game recently and here was my experience,Start up with vanilla(no expansions) for 2 1/2 months, besides the occasional day where the servers are down, which did happen more that I would expect for $15 a month, the game was fun.Then my account was hacked and I lost my two characters. I called blizzard and despite trying for 4 hours I could get a hold of anyone. The message kept saying that they were too busy try again later. So I emailed them and was basically told it was my fault for not buy a wow authenticator.So to sum up to start playing and go a year it would cost $280(not counting the upcoming cataclysm expansion) for a video game. If your willing to fork over that kind of money you expect a certain level of customer service for the company and I got none. I will never buy from blizzard again. This was easily my worst gaming experience of my life."
2,World of Lagcraft,"I would like to say that this is a very good game when it works. Blizzard conducted an Open Beta of the game two weeks or so prior to launch. On the second day the servers were so lagged that it became unplayable. Unfortunately for Blizzard, they had already packaged and were in the process of shipping the game. Now that the retail version of the game has hit the streets, things have not changed. The servers are worse than they were in the open beta. Understand that if you purchase this game, your play time will be limited.As far as the game is concerned, when you can play it, the game is loads of fun. I personally think out of all the games of it's genre, this one is bar none the best. However, I would recommend waiting a month or so and let them sort out these lag issues they are having. That's about how long it took them to sort out the problems with another title they released a few years ago named Diablo 2."
1,Fun... if you can get on,"This game is total bulls**t. I just got it and not one server will let me create a character. This could've been one of the greatest games ever. I played it at a friends house and thought it was great, and it would be simply amazing if the developers weren't morons. No character creation during peak hours?! What the f**k it's fun, but in a sense it's one of the worst games ever, you can't even play it! This game took me almost an hour to load and I still can't play it, I'll have to wait till tomorrow now. I shouldn't have to wait to play a f**king video game this is such bulls**t. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you have a LOT of time on your hands to sit and WAIT."
1,the WORST of the WORST,"Do not purchase this game, it is a complete waste of money. I say stick with WWIII Frozen throne. NO one in their dear life would want to shell out 15$ a month to play this crappy game unless they are donald trump or paris hilton. DO not buy it."
1,Blizzard doesn't know anything about MMORPS,"Blizzard made a bad mistake on this game. MMOORPGS are all about community, and Blizzard is blatantly ignoring the international gaming community in MMORPGs by not letting international guilds playing together, thus willfully trying to break them up. I feel this is exemplary of Blizzard's attitude towards the community and thus spells disaster for a game like this."
1,suckiest game on earth,this game sucks. i expected this game to be better than the others but this game sucks hardcore
3,One more thing . . .,"It is not made clear mentioned anywhere but not only does one pay 45.00 for the software, they must pay for monthly access to the game system which means $$$ over time. This may not be acceptable to some."
3,not what I had in mind,"I loved warcraft II!I thought this would be like a sequell or something.its an entirly new thing!I like new things but not when I wasnt expecting it.also why should I pay $40 bucks for something only to be stuck with a monthly subscripition fee?I like free games. I dont mind paying for good games.but I'd like to pay once, not forever."
1,What a rip off.,"World of WarCraft, should have been named world of WarCrap. This game is nothing but a rip off on every level. It's way over priced. It can't handle the population that it gets. It want let you play without going on line. That is the major problem right there. Any game that want let you play without joining and paying 280 a year is nothing but a rip off. I'm also told that there is a suprise in this world. Well they mentioned it on BB theory the other night. OMG. Get a lifefolks.NOTHING BUT A RIP OFF. STAY AWAY."
2,Just a Box,I thought I was buying a used CD with the files so I could at least install the files. When it came in the mail there was no CD just a box and the manuals in side it. It could have been on my part when ordering because I might have missed where it said that there was no CD included but just in case anyone is ordering this please understand that it is only a box and manual.
5,Love this game!,I bought this game for my teenage son. He says he just loves it. It is the most fun game ever. He plays it all the time when he's not in school or doing chores or homework. He says it is the best game he's played.
4,online gameplay,"An excellent game by an excellent company that continually provides updates and sertvice to their software. You will need a fast internet connection, and a credit card for the subscription fee. Be ready for a long install, though, the virtual-world is huge, and you will have to download a lot of ""patches"" before you can play."
5,WoW ! And what a game it is,"This has gotten al my attention since star wars galaxies got dubmed down so small children could be able to play it without going into a spaz.soem say this game has alot of bugs hehe i guess every online game does but this has not even 1% as many bugs as Star wars galaxies has..and the creators much UNlike star wars galaxies, does care for their players of all age groupthers always somethign new added to this game and if a problem should arise its fixed fast.i would recomend this game to any online gamer... :)"
4,DVD VERSION ** FOLKS,I decided to try this game after watching ~ make love ~ not warcraft ~ & ~reading blizzard's philsophy for the game1st time I tried (trial) ~ the menu systemseemed like an over-complicated pain-in-a#z ~I'm 4 starring it ~ for promise ~ c how it goes
4,Addicting?,"This game (as many of you know) is more addictive than heroine. I don't think I count the number of hours I've spent playing Blizzard products and this one won't be any different. Now if I could only stick to making one character... With the release of the battlegrounds ""expansion"", I don't think I'll be doing much else."
5,Incredible and Addicting (slightly),If you are considering buying this game and you are reading a review then you must know people who play and you must have seen the game in action. All I can say is the game speaks for itself and you can always run the 10 day trial and see what you think about it for free. So get on it! :)
3,Availability,"The game may be great, but the availability of the game only in physical box form (no electronic download) is very dissapointing. We are January 17th 2005, and still the game is sold out everywhere. Even Blizzard's own online store is sold out. Yet other online games (and even non online games like Half-Life 2) are available for electronic purchase and download. Blizzard, please, bring yourselves to 1990's sales technology at least. Respect your customers and don't force us to go to the store (even if it were available and not sold out) when you already possess the technology to distribute the software electronically. If it is your resellers that are forcing you to work this way, why have other large companies succeeded where you have failed?"
2,im really 18,I am really 18 but i don't feel like sighing up for a amazon account. This game is only worth it if you plan to dedicate your life to it. This game on the least expensive monthly fee will still cost you about 145$ a year! A price which seems so unjustifed. Don't expect to be good at this game unless you apply...yes apply as in write an application to a good giuld and raid with them atleast 18 hours a week. Players who don't belong to such exclusive guild will find that it is just stupid and pointless to even try to play with people with such better gear. It can be a fun game if you dedicate a lot of time but if you don't plan to invest in a game like Guild Wars with no monthly fee.
1,Good Game.... BAD SERVERS,"From the Worldofwarcraft.com forums to this reviews system y need to say... The game is good, but i must to be honest, pay $15 box per month for a game that is all the time with SERVER DOWN is very disappointed. I think pay 15$ per month is to much if you get server down or servers under maintenance. This is all the time, three or more time per week, from 4 to 6 hours every time.Blizzard have an excellent game, very good video graphics, but for what? If you can not play the game.Like many World Of Warcraft players i feel very disappointed for servers down times, if you want a good online video game, for the servers down times, World Of Warcraft is not the best choice."
2,NOT A GOOD RPG,"This game was alright, for about five minuts, in the starting the game dosent tell you what todo and if u do get a quest there is no marker on the stupid map to find the objective point. Another down fall is u have to a pay a 15 dollar fee to the play the game every month, its just not worth it, and to finish this off the game is just flat out not fun, and if you are lokking for a great rpg buy guild wars that game is the best and it is free online play."
1,Game has CRITICAL bugs.,"This game would be ok, but there are very critical bugs and Blizzard seems to have no intention of fixing them.Example, The very most powerful weapon for levels 20-40 in the game is basically unattainable. You need to protect a woman named Daphne, but if she dies there is a bug where she won't respawn for future attempts due to a bug. The actual game server has to reboot (very rare) for her to return. The developers claim there is a fix, but won't put it in! There are more bugs like these but this is just the first to come to mind.So this demonstrates signinficant problems with support, quality, and game balance issues. I'd suggest a more proven product without these critical bugs."
1,They are forcing you to play a localized server,"You may not know what this means but they are taking a world wide game and limiting it to your local region. This kills the game community, bad move by the makers - hopefully they will change their minds before they release the game"
3,Read Carefully,"I gave 3 stars simply because I HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS GAME YET. I expect it to be at well over 24 stars. I refused to beta this game as well as any other game I am hyped up for simply for the reason I do not want to spoil the perfected copy for myself. I am the biggest fan on blizzard I have ever met. (( Thats saying alot, eh? )) I have never played a remotely bad blizzard game and anyone who says they have, are full of crap. I was playing FFXI for quite a long time, but I quit a few months ago. Not saying that is a bad game, but I am in too much of a WoW mindset to become to involved in that game, knowing I will drop it as soon as this comes out. Every screenshot I've seen looks spectacular. Alot of people don't like the "" cheezy, childish, kiddish, cartoonish "" graphics in this game. I love them. To do anything else would take away from the Warcraft genre I love so much. I expect to not put this down for quite a long time."
3,boring...,"One of the most funniest game i have played, but also the most boring.I would'nt call this a mmorpg..When I played the WoW beta i got to lvl 8 and i loved it, it was so much fun. But at the end i felt like there was something missing. I started playing Everquest 2 for awhile and loved it even more, but after 3 months i wanted to try WoW again.And I hated it."
1,Shallow Shallow gameplay,Thsi is quite possibly the easiest MMORPG out. That's probably why it's blowing EQ 2 out of the water in sales. The problem is your playing for an hour and your level 50 it's way to esy. If you want a real challenge get EQ 2. Also in EQ 2 there are no real dumb asses just really cool helpful people. I like WoW but I just want a challenge but I'm sure 11 year olds want a game where a quest is going to the town you were already walking to. thsi game doesn't deserve the sale prices or great reviews it's gettting on this website. If you want real MMORPG buy EQ 2.
2,WoW makes me laugh,"After deciding to take a break from EQ2 and after reading all the positive reviews, I figured I would give it a try. The game's quests are very unimaginative (ie. kill x amount of x creatures) over and over again. The graphics are very much along the lines of Nintendo, with very little customization available to change your characters looks.WoW has yet to come out with an expansion. How the players can play the same game for a year and a half is beyond me. They have an expected release date of October 2006 for the expansion, but two years is a long time for only releasing their first expansion.A majority of the players are younger players that cannot afford the computer to play EQ2, and thus, the amount of 'Chuck Norris' jokes gets very old very quickly. In summary, I went back to EQ2 and love it very much."
1,Good content.. but can never play.,World of warcraft is quite fun to play (even considering when it takes about 200hrs to get to a resonable level). I've played this game for 480 hours... about 50 of them hours is waiting to join a server! The servers are all too populated and once i do get connected there is probably a server maintance or the server just crashes. This games is diffinetly not value for money considering when you pay 10usd a month when you cant even play)
3,I'm back to EQ1,I played WoW for a good ten months. I maxed out a few races. It was fun. But it is pretty boring at lvl 60. I moved back to EQ1. It truly is a exciting game compared to WoW. In WoW all the creatures in a zone are around the same lvl. So once your in a new zone you know what to expect. Most of the monster camps are layed out the same. Most of the buildings are cut and pasted from other zones. WoW lacks the sense of adventure that EQ1 provides. EQ1 keeps you on your toes and in my opinion looks and sounds ten times better than WoW. I'm back to the original adventure game that got me started in this genre. I am loving it again...
2,"Yes, No, Maybe So","While WOW has many great features to offer gamers who enjoy rpg's, it also has its disappointments. The game alone is ridiculously expensive, and then you have to go and pay $15 more each month. Definitely not worth the money loss. The servers crash no less than two times each and every week. The customer service lacks the term ""service"" by a longshot. The fact that you have to continually pay for this game even when it lacks so much is complete pointless. The game has cartoonistic graphics and the gameplay features can easily be overlooked. Many players on this game are not the friendliest of players either and do not offer any help to newbies. The game is thrilling at first but then it gets boring VERY VERY QUICKLY. Between the crashing servers and the constant lagging, and the bullies who roam the environments, the game lacks too many qualities overall. I would highly suggest saving your money for something much more worthwhile."
4,"Great game,but Addictive and expensive..","Ok, this game is awesome im only lvl 16 so far but its great..The guilds are a cool concept of the game..some can be good while others can be horrible.mostly good people that are very helpful(get a high level friend so they can help you out with questions)make a lot of friends because they come in handy and are fun to do quests and dungeons with. overall great game.(so far anyway)The quests are worthwhile and give better EXP then just killing mobs..the only other MMO game i've played was Runescape(RS) and the quests were VERY boring and NOT worthwhile.BUY THE GAME! :o)"
4,Hacked,"the game itself is great. my problem is how easy it is to get your account hacked. i've played a handful of MMOs and WoW is the only game that i've ever had hacked... three times to be exact. the most recent hack got my account suspended and i will most likely get it completely banned since it's so easy for hackers to hack.i do suggest people play this game, but i also suggest you change your password regularly... even if you're taking a break from the game."
5,"Great, but beware","WOW is a great gamewith all kinds of options to choose from. As an avid oline RPG player ( UO 4 year Vet ) WOW is a total different world, read the book that comes with the game before playing or you will be lost. I was skeptical of buying this game and weas always told its great, I agree it is. There is always someone out there who will you out with a quest ( 2000 of them )and killing monsters that with the quests makes it all that much more fun. Trade and learn a profession.. Good game, i recommend it."
5,best game for the pc,Ive been playing warcraft games for a while and this one is the best. There are only a few problems with this game. One i dont like this pvp server or normal server. It confuses me. I would like it better if you can just attack player from the opposite faction any time you want and you wont have to turn on a little flag thing. Another problem is you have to pay a monthly fee but it is worth it. I also dont like how it requires a lot of RAM and CPU speed. If you dont have enouth of that it will lag a lot and be very slow.Overall this is a great game and i recommend this especially if you have played warcraft 3 reign of chaos and frozen throne.
1,Worst popular MMORPG evah!,"Graphics are awful, grinding is awful and majority of the online community either are or act like pre-teen or teen mooks. One of the worst, yet inexplicably popular, games ever released. I cannot comprehend how anyone's life could be so tedious as to make this an attractive option. I also can't comprehend how the same company that brought us the elegant and timeless Diablo II came out with this wretched, sloppy mess. I know millions like it--but millions liked Brittney Spears and Pet Rocks, too. If you've never played before and you have some taste in games--STAY AWAY--don't waste your money like I did!"
3,amazing.,"Okay good Graphics, easy to use, and sorry blizzard. this stinksThis game atttracts all those Battle.net Junkies which is really annoying if you where looking for a decent MMORPG. it can't really be a RPG if it doesn't have any role playing qualities. the quality of the roleplaying on roleplaying servers can be found at any movie theatre. not the actors on the big screen, but the man in the Garfield suit standing outside. the world is biggish but not big enough to hold ones interest. This gets clasified as a time waster for the people who have to much time on their hands. The community is horrible. you ask for help and you get ""YOUR MUTHER U @^*!"". you can find a better community on Ever Quest... and thats sad."
4,looks good,but looks can be misleading. World of warcraft(i am hoping) will be as they are saying a MMORPG but faster paced (more action) most games of this genre are boring to me there fun and all but spending 15 hours pressing a button and then clicking the mouse about 6 times during a period of two minutes about 250 times until you finally get a level (everquest) isnt my idea of fun. The graphics on this game look a little under the standard of say everquest II but like i said looks can be decieving and hpefuly thi game will deliver
1,Worst Game Ever,If you like a game where you have no need to group the entire time you play the game get this game. If you want to play a game where someone who plays 2 hours a day can get same gear as someone who plays 10 get this game. If you like to play a game with graphics comparable to some Nintendo 64 titles get this game. If you want to play a game with a bunch of 11 year olds running around all day get this game. For anyone who wants to play a challenging game that you cant max your character in a week get Everquest 2.
1,I only pay once!,"I bought this game thinking that I could play it on my own. Nope. Once you pay the fourty bucks for it, then you get the privilege of paying a monthly fee to play because it is only an on-line game. Nothing mentioned in the Amazon ad about that. I returned the game, and Amazon was very fair regarding a refund. I think that all on line games are basically a rip off since it forces you to have to play to get your money's worth, which never happens because you always have to pay more! Sorry, I am not into dealing with that since I have a life."
1,Bad Job of Localized North American Servers,"blizzard has adopted localized servers which only allows players with north american addresses to play on north american servers. if you have guildmates from other countries or you LIVE in another country, you will not be able to play on the north american server."
1,guild wars is better,WoW is an ok game. yet the monthly fees r killer. guild wars is the game to play. it has no monthly fees and it is better than wow. it is the same type of game for alot less $.wow also gets very boring after the 1st couple of weeks. u will get tired of being robbed by higher lvl players that hav all the time in the world. in guild wars the max lvl is 20 so u hav a chance to play pvp fairly. u also dont see ne body when u r running around the world unless u team up or go into towns. there isnt much walking time either u can teleport straight to a town u hav been to it is great. wow all u do is walk all the time and get robbed it is not fun. take my advice and save money on a much better game.
1,i felt up a man for THIS?,"i just vant to say.. un dun toi fewa, schventy scheven. dis game vas so not wort the humiliation and gook change i schvelted to sit around and look pretty for. characters are too fat, lose some veight you crosswires! plus, i was dishappointed to find a lack of teh superheros. not one!"
4,remotecar is a fool he lies,"This is what the freak said.I speak in absolute sincerity when I say EVERYONE who writes a review on this game seriously are just idiots. Right now, the game is in BETA. That means its NOT DONE YET. Changes will happen. You can't judge a book by its first draft first sentecence.Oh and the idiot who talked about flying mounts and classes and optional PvP is crazy too- there will NOT be flying mounts excluding taxi-type mounts which fly certain flight paths and charge money. The classes are much more than he mentioned, and he neglected to mention some new races that are now announced.I think he is a freak and liar and should not get the game."
2,Deeply disappointed.,"I was deeply disappointed with this game. First of all I was hoping there would be a version where you did not have to go online to play. Sort of a one player home version. Alas it only has an online version. I would have been happier with a Sim.Secondly I could not load the whole thing into my computer, so I could not even play the online version. I just wasted my money for a game I could not play, either alone on my computer or online with others."
2,"Fun, but too costly for what you get","This game would be better if (a) the servers were up more often (they seem to be down more often than they're up - they're down right now); (b) you didn't have to waste so much time running back to your dead body to resurrect (you can't leave the computer for a break, you have to sit there and navigate your avatar to your body, watching it run is all you can do - that's not what I call playing, that's wasting my money); (c) you didn't have to waste so much time traveling (so slow!); (d) there were more quests that could be done solo (nothing is so boring as being unable to do any quests b/c your server has few players and your quests are all Elite and can't be done alone). I'm sure there's more. It could be a great game, but it's not. Oh well."
1,"Great game, horrible service","World of Warcraft is one of the best MMORPGs I have ever played. The game is incredibly addictive, great fun, and has pretty much everything going for it, content-wise.So why the bad review? Because their level of customer service is abhorrent. Unacceptable amounts of downtime, and forum moderators that respond with more or less stock responses to issues, and take absolutely no steps to accurately inform players of what's really going on. The high population servers are laggy, constantly crashing, and despite many supposed ""fixes"" the problem persists, and has persisted since the game was released.To sum up, World of Warcraft is a great game, if you don't mind constantly being unable to play it."
4,"Easy to use, immersive environment","WoW is light-year's beyond the last MMORPG I played (Ultima Online). The user interface is highly intuitive and the game is designed to make it easy to learn and fun to play. My only complaint is that there are frequent service outages related to high load on the network and the servers. The outages wouldn't be so annoying if the game wasn't so much fun, though."
3,Two games in one,"World of Warcraft appears to be two games in one at this point. From level 1 to level 60, the game is fun and enjoyable for those who like solo and small groups (up to five people.) The world is remarkably immersive. The graphics initially appear very cartoonish, but you get used to them and the world is filled with details that make it seems ""real"" in a way many other games do not. I had a great time until I got to 60.Once you get to 60, though, the game changes. At that point, the ways to advance your character are PvP and huge raids. The best gear in the game can only be gotten at high PvP rank or from dungeons that are designed for 20- or 40-people raids. You can no longer to any meaningful advancement solo or in small groups.I rated this game a three, but that is highly subjective. If you like huge guilds and huge raids, this game is an easy 4 or 5. However, if you like small ""friendly"" guilds and group sizes smaller than 20, like I do, this game is a three."
4,quite lengthy!,"Everyone likes to compare this game to EverQuest, and with good reason. The amount of time it will take to completely finish this game is incredible. You will NOT get bored with this game any time soon.The difficulty in this game is pretty hard, but not quite as tough as EverQuest. I don't know why, really.All the quests and features that are included in this game are guaranteed to satisfy you for a very long time. I really recommend this game to everyone. You will NOT grow bored with World of Warcraft."
5,get it,If you like mmorpg's then this is the best out there by a long way. Updated regularly and plenty of help. Takes about an hour to really get into it and is constantly challenging but no good game is easy. Prepare to lose you life and have fun while doing it.
5,Very well designed,"I played Diablo II for many years and was reluctant to switch to a subscription-based RPG. However, Blizzard did not disappoint. World of Warcraft is by far the most well-designed game I've played. While it lacks the high-definition graphics of some other titles, the gameplay is unbeatable. I've read complaints from other reviewers that it is slow. Though it may seem that way to new players, the level progression is actually much faster than in other MMORPGS such as Everquest. Blizzard consciously made an effort to cater to a casual as well as a hardcore public, and they did a fine job.There is a large variety of classes and races to choose from with many fun ""secondary"" professions like Cooking and Fishing. Lots of things to do to pass the time.Highly recommended for any gamer."
1,Don't believe the hype...,"This game is nothing but a weak Everquest clone. The developers only cater to a very small portion(5-15%) of their playerbase(raiders). Non-raiders get the shaft. They havn't made a nonraiding instance in years. This is what happens with you bring EQ elitists like Jeff Kaplan into head development.The worst part is when these ""skilled"" raiders bring their overpowered gear into Pvp. You will get 1-2shotted over and over and over. No strategy involved just 1shotting. Not my idea for fun.So unless you like being owned by basement dwellers who play 24/7, stay clear from this game. Wait for Warhammer Online."
2,"Worst service ever, not even playable 1/2 the time...","Since the server problems won't seem to go away I decided to write this as did many others from the game's offical forums (so they said they were anyhow). DO NOT buy this game yet. The servers are down 50% of the time, and even when you can connect it either crashes or lags so bad you exit anyhow. Make sure you visit the games forum and check to see if all this crap is fixed before you buy it!! @.5 million people currently pay Blizzard 15$ a month to NOT play it, and they never fix anything, think about it. Crap game, Blizzard bombed this one hardcore."
3,"Suposedly great, but buyer beware!","Everyone says that WoW is great fun, has great graphics, and so on. There are a few things, however, you should know before you buy this game.*This game requires a very High-end computer, equipped with a PC-DVD rom drive.*To keep playing WoW for any time beyond one month, you must pay a monthly subscription fee of [...]. This may not seem like so much, but for one game, it's not worth it really.Apart from that, I think it's a very fun game from what I know, and I wish I could play it. If you are willing, and can pay [...] monthly; and have a PC-DVD rom drive, then go ahead, buy this and Burning Crusade, and enjoy!"
3,Where is Diablo III?,"I've played all the Warcraft's, this has some cool attributes, still miss Diablo"
4,Better than I expected,This is the first interactive online game I have experienced. Its hard not to become addicted to the game.
5,Great fun for the whole family.,"I picked up WoW on the suggestion of a friend. To be honest, this is only my second MMORPG, so I cannot compare it to much, but what I can say is that I am still playing 6 months later.Also, and to me this is the biggest praise I can give; my wife began playing after watching me for a few hours, and my father has just begun this past week!WoW sports an easy interface, thousands of quests, many ""instanced"" dungeons, and a large selection of race/class combinations.To date I have played Alliance characters to the ""endgame"" content, and just recently, my guild has switched over to the Horde. Its wonderful to find original missions on both sides of the war!While this may not be the game that holds your interest for the next few years, I guarantee it will keep you busy for months to come."
5,Late to the party,"I just started playing World of Warcraft a couple of months ago. I've been a video game fan since I was a kid and am amazed at how huge the worlds are and how much there is to discover and do. I play it a couple nights a week with some work buddies and it's really fun. They just added voice chat so now I'll burn less cell phone minutes conference calling with them. This is an addicting game so if you have no self-control, don't get hooked."
5,The One,"I was a stress tester, and this game is incredible. I Loved it from the begining. This is the game to rule all other games. Pre-order WOW as soon as possible."
1,"Super addicting, life ruining, not worth the risk to buy","I purchased this game for my 13 year old for christmas last year. It has now been smashed to pieces, my son has be banned from the computer for who knows how long....WHY.......Sneaking up and staying up all night to playSkipping school to playStealing credit cards to reinstate account after child restricted and account terminated.Lying beyond beliefPersonality ChangesShirking responsibilities, friends, family, school workGrads went from A's & B'sto D's & F'sThe child nearly had a nervous breakdown from loss of sleep playing this stupid game, and then again when the game was taken away from him.I WARN YOU....DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOR CHILD, you will live to regret it. They become creatures you don't even recognize."
1,Do you like having a social life? Maybe not...,"This game, which I think is much like Diablo 2 (same general shutff), is addicting to no end. You WILL be playing this game all the time, and you will feel like crap when you are not. It is the same thing as tobacco withdrawl, expect virtual. Most of the people who play (yes, most) are jerks who care only about gold and items and raids. It is like a second life which gains importance over your first. It also is not cheap to play this game... $15 a month which is $180 a year, which means some people have already payed $375 to play this game for 2 years. Due credit is given to the developers however, because they created a immersive, enormous world plus a GOLDMINE! Use your discresion when considering this purchase."
2,Immature Players,"The problem with Warcraft is that you have to deal with loads of immature players. Some go far out of their way to make things hard for others, just because its fun for them. This kind of behavior is technically against the rules, but reporting them never accomplishes anything.I made the mistake of prepaying my account for six months or so, and I'll keep playing until then (even I'll admit its pretty fun at times), but I'm not renewing after that."
4,"Good game, even better graphics","For a game of WOW's magnitude I was really impressed with the quality of its graphics, the creative quests, and variety available for character costomization. However, I found the support to be less than helpful and the end-game content to be overly time consuming. Overall, I would definitely recommend it but be prepared for a sometimes rude online community."
3,Not fun playing with losers,"WoW has the potential to be a great game, unfortunately most of the people who play it are lame. It is rare to find someone who just wants to play the game to have fun and experience the richness that the game has to offer. More important to them is leveling up and getting equipment and gold. Since most people do NOT play to have fun, it is difficult to have fun yourself. People treat the game like it is a job or something. There is much badmouthing and swearing in the PvP, and very little good sportsmanship. If you have a friend to play with, that is best. It is not impossible to find good people to play with in the game either. If you can do that and at the same time not let other people's bad attitudes get to you, it is a blast."
2,"Good at first, but gets old fast","I liked the gameplay and graphics up until I hit level 13, then the game felt really repetitive. Receive quest, kill monsters, retrieve items from monsters, return items to quest giver, receive XP and/or reward items. Over and over and over and over... I have leatherworking and skinning as my trades, and even that got tedious. I have skinned 1,000+ beasts and still haven't reached the 2nd level of skinning... Wow.I tried the PvP against the Horde, and my group mates were so helter skelter, we never even put together a game plan. It was a free for all and we lost in no time. There was no way to get everyone together for a plan of some sort. Blah.Oh well, it is very fun and addicting until you realize all that work is really going nowhere fast (uh slow)."
1,"Bad support, Characters disappear! excellent game if it work","Bad support, Characters disappear! excellent game if it workedFirst off bear in mind that's it's not only $50 for this game.. they want a monthly fee too.The game itself is really good like the previous warcrafts it's a top notch game however it seems blizzard has no I.T. operations experience and the game goes down way to often.I've spent week developing a character only to have it disappear!Contacting support is not a pleasant experience expect to wait a week for a reply and it's bound to be a cut and paste answer that probably does not apply to your email.I've sent four mails so far and have had the same cut and paste reply!If your willing to put up with shoddy support, the loss of characters and lot's of downtime this is for you."
3,Great Game,"This is a great game, astounding graphics, lots of questline and lots to do.. The only problem is the customer support. To me.. i think it still needs some ironing out."
3,Great graphics,"Looks impressive, but we weren't ready for the extensive downloads and pay to play. We gave up when we saw a 12 hour download time, after already spending 3 hours downloading the game and signing up. Only for the strong of heart!"
1,dreadfuly pointless,"I bought this game when it came out, that was my first mistake. I payed 60 dollars for this game when it first hit the shelves thinking it was going to be fun. I got fooled. With the lack of propper accounting support, they overdrafted my bank account for trying to delete my account. So now im out 60 for the game, 15 for a month of my life I can't get back, and 45 for the total over draft charges. So this game that cost me 60 dollars ended up well over one hundred. The repetitive game play is a huge turn off. Once you get your character to level 60, there is no point to the game. Start another character? HA! I've wasted to much time with the other character."
5,Great Buy,"I have been following World Of Warcraft for some time now. If you are into any of the Warcraft games then you may like this, it takes you deeper into the world then you have ever been. If you have ever player the diablo series the game in kind of like that, just better graphics and many more things to do. It wont be released until december 31st, 2003 but you should order it now while suplies last! BUT if you do not want to pay to play this game THEN DONT BUY IT you have to pay like $$-$$ a month to play it..it is an online game...Stunning graphics, great sound, wonderful characters...GREAT GAME..."
2,A Sugar Coated MMO.,"What happens when you take the same old boring MMO gaming system and pour sugar on it? You get WoW, that's what. It's a huge timesink and currently has zero endgame fun.They ONLY promising thing about WoW is it's PvP system that's being developed. Personally, I'd rather go play NWN or HL2. They don't take 6 months to create a character that I can PvP with..."
1,"Weak, I am down $50.","I was told by some friends how great this game is and I bought it and played and for awhile I though it was good. Then after the second day I got tired of it. Now I never want to play this game again, worse I can't return the game. I am going to cancel my subscription in the next two days or so before they send me my first monthly bill. Really disappointing. I went back to playing Battlefield 2/Special Forces I will stick with that game until they come out with something better. Best part is that game is free to play online unlike this game. Get it and you will enjoy it."
2,It Gets Boring Quick,"There is nothing ""revolutionary"" about this game. If anything, Blizzard and Sony shared too many notes on WoW and EQ2. Both games will not allow player advancement unless you complete certain quests. I don't know about you, but I don't like to be told what to do and held back because I did not make the right choice in an MMORPG. Why can't someone make a game where quests aren't a mandatory part of the game, but can be done and are rewarding if you want to do them? This game is all about quests. If you get bored going here, coming back, going here, coming back... don't play this game! Not to mention, groups are hard to come by, most people are soloing.... What's the point of soloing the entire time in an MMORPG? And as far as the graphics go, there is little to be impressed by, and many of the zones repeat the same structure of town, it's just in different hues. If you like monotony and a cartoon-feel to your MMORPG, then this game is for you!"
1,LETS BUY A GAME BECAUSE OF THE WORD WARCRAFT,"LETS FACE IT.. THIS IS PROBABLTY THE MOST OVERRATED GAME OF ALL TIME. WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THIS:1) WASTE OF MONEY. $15 A MONTH IS TOO F$@#ing EXPENSIVE...2) LETS ALL BUY IT BECAUSE THE WORD ""WARCRAFT"" IS IN IT3) THE GRAPHICS LOOK LIKE SILICON VALLEY (CRAPPY N64 GAME)4) 70 + SERVERS OR SOMETHING... WOW WHAT A COMMUNITY IF ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS FROM A PAST GAME GOES TO ONE SERVER AND YOUR OTHER FRIEND GOES TO ANOTHER SERVER YOU HAVE A HARD CHOICE TO MAKE5) COMBAT IS FUN.. PRESS A COMMAND AND WATCH UR CHARACTER AUTO ATTACK MONSTERS... RINSE AND REPEAT FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED HOURS6) PVP IS THE SAME. IMAGINE D2 WHERE EVERYONE PLANS OUT THERE CHARACTER TO SPECIFIC BUILDS WITH PERCECT ITEMS AND MEMORIZE EVERY QUEST. THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING.7) THIS GAME IS LAME I RECCOMEND YOU DO NOT BUY IT ( THEY ARE OUT OF STOCK EVERYWHERE ANYWAYS)8) BUY ARMIES OF EXIGO INSTEAD..9) LOL JUST KIDDING THAT GAME IS EVEN WORSE"
1,beware,"My computer has twice the stated CPU of the requirements, and it still wouldn't load. This is only for those with state of the art computers."
1,How do you PLAY IT???!!!,"Sure WoW sounds fun, but how would I know? Even though I bought the game I never got to play it.FIRST of all, it takes up over 4000 MEGABITES! I couldnt install anything on my comp after this.SECOND, even if you get through the installer, if you don't have DSL or high-speed, you have to wait 12 HOURS to download some ""patch"". I couldnt wait that long.THIRDLY, even though you buy the game you still have to pay $15 a MONTH after the first free month of play. I WOULD rate this higher, but I never got to play it!!!"
1,A fool and his money,"I find it deplorable that a gaming company makes you fork over a significant chunk of change for a game and then does not provide you with at least a year's worth of membership to play the game. Call me old fashioned, but I expect more value for my money."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"This game is ok at best. First off the game allows you to go up to level 80 in the game. Though you have a long way to go in leveling the game only kicks off at level 20 because at level 20 you get a mount, better spell and other things. But after level 21 it gets boring fast. Before you get to level 20 you are basically grinding for level 20. After level 20 you are still grinding for level 80. So basically you get a few hours of actual fun in the game.The game gets boring because the quests are empty and all of them are basically the same every time and basically when you get down to it you are paying 15 dollars a month just to get a better weapon for your character and better spells and other things. Now that wouldn't all be problem if they didn't charge you 15 dollars a month. If the game was free like guilds of war i wouldn't have a problem. Even if they had to be that greedy and charge you money at least charge 5 dollars a moth and that would be an acceptable price."
1,World Of War crap,"Wow is a fun game if your 12 years old.The graphics are to cartoonish,game play to easy.Plus the main reason i don't like WOW is that the players are rude and obnoxious.Final Fantasy XI is a much better game with more story and variety that WOW could never have.I played WOW for 2 hours on friends account and fell asleep right away. WOW = BORING!!!Another thing about is that your stuck with one job too!! ;; At least in Final Fantasy XI you have a subjob that helps alot and one character has access to more then 15 jobs as well as keeping all your rank points and everything! WOW sucks!!! NUFF SAID!!!!!"
1,Do you like downloading patches?,"I started installing this game three hours ago. I am on my third downloaded patch (I think it does something to the druids). If you have less than 18 hours a day to devote to gaming, this is not the game for you. Go outside. Get some sunshine."
1,this game sux,"well i cant really rate this game. i still am not able to play. i wated at least a day befor i got to play this so called ""best game ever""... YA RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!! all i do is wait u cant play w/out all of the lag... u read it LAG ALOT OF IT. people who r writing these reviews that say this game is the best just got the game and r still hooked. THIS GAME GETS EXTREMLY OLD!!!!! lag, no support, gets old, pvp is not fair... ever, walking all the time, profesions and classes r not balanced at all, get robed all the time, $15 a month, i could go on forever. get guild wars and save the money and the time. (guild wars is also a mmorpg but alot better) ive been reading some of these reviews and half of these people dont know what they r talking about at all. i dont think they have played wow or guild wars."
1,Rip Off,"The game came in fine condition, but the license was was already used, so the game could not be registered and played. An online game is pretty useless without a license. I assumed that if it was for sale, it had some value, but I was wrong."
2,Uhh......waste of money??,"Okay, first off this game totally sucks. I'm a long time fan of RPGs. I've beaten the complete Final Fantasy Series, EverQuest is great, some of the other Warcraft games were good, Age of Empires, Command & Conquer, ectera. But this game let me done completely. I expected a h3ll of alot more from Blizzard. Even Diablo and Diablo II were better than this. If you're a hardcore Warcraft gamer/fan, then you will probably love this, if you're just an RPG fan.......buy something useful, like EQ2 or something. If this review hasn't convinced you, then please, do buy the game...........from me. I paid $49.99 for it, I'll sell cheaper, check out the Used & New selling and look for me."
3,Blizzard is unreliable,The game is fun and extremely addictive. The stability of the online gaming system is lacking. Problems occur at least twice a week. It's inexcusable! They need to lower their profit margin and focus on reliability so they don't lose more customers. They SUCK!
1,Dont buy this game,I have played this game for around two years and have multiple level 70 characters and thoroughly enjoy it. However the game is broken (as of october 2008) and unplayable at the moment due to horrendous lag issues and server shut downs.My advice is avoid this game and the new expansion pack Wrath of the Lich King like the plague until the game becomes playable again. Just thought I'd save you some dollars and whole bunch of frustration.
5,GREAT GAME!!!!!,"what i've read 4 this game(aLOT),is that it's like dungoen siege and FF11 put together, you can buy armor, get trade skills and ride beasts(really cool),down part is you have to pay 4 it monthly, but it's worth it! can't wait 'til it comes out! <(^-^)>"
3,Love/Hate Relationship,"WOW (world of warcraft) deserves 3 stars. The short and sweet run-down:PROS:1)Beautiful scenery with lots of little details2)Easy to learn, but complicated enough (as in many different approaches to playing it) to give you plenty to do while playing3)Lots of playability--can basically play it forever4)No bugs (at least not for me)CONS:1)Takes forever to load (I mean hours)2)Monthly fee3)Tuesday is the day Blizzard updates/fixes the game, and they aren't quick about it.4)Constantly downloading patches, which you need to play. Sometimes I have a hard time downloading these patches. My computer often tells me I am unable to for various reasons, which can get pretty frustrating.4 PROS + 4 CONS= 3 stars"
3,Hott Mage Goin' Off,Length:: 4:40 MinsVid By:Atkins Switcher World of Warcrafthttp://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=16988http://files.filefront.com/Atkins+Switcher+Episode+2/;4865756;/fileinfo.htmlhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvd5hpX2dy8
4,"Great game, but consider the ""actual"" cost with the subscription","My older boys have really enjoyed the game, but keep in mind tha actual cost with the subscription fees. After forking over a 6-month subscription - I sincerely hope the game stays near the top of their playlist.On the other hand, my younger son seems to have the better value with his ""ToonTown"" subscription."
4,Like a Drug - Can't Stop Playing yet Costly,"I bought this game at a friend's request; teaming up with other people enhances game play. Now my wife and kids are hooked and I rarely get to play. Underscore ""get to"" its addictive and fun. It truly is a ""World"" where you can be a fantasy reflection of yourself. The world is huge and presents challenges for you as you increase your character's abilities. The story line is simple, but the game play is brilliantly crafted.Down side - be prepared to shell out some money. $50 for the game and $15/mo to play. If you want to play on your home LAN you'll need to buy a copy for each computer and shell out $15 per account. There are no family plans which would greatly reduce the cost for my family to all play together simultaneously; right now I can only afford for each person to play on the same account (many characters are allowed on one account) one-after-the-other."
4,Fun...sort of.,"I have spent the last 2 weeks playing this game. About 3-4 days out of the week. Mainly on weekends. It is a lot of fun, if you can get groups of people to play with you. Preferably friends. Playing alone feels a bit like a chore however. Servers are usually busy during peak hours (weekends and week nights) and annoying kids roam the land in most cases. Mission can get a bit repetitive and they leave you with no choice but to do them if you ever plan on leveling up.Graphics are nice, the world is immense. It truly feels like an epic. Tons of items and skills make this game an unique experience.BIGGEST COMPLAIN - Having multiple servers. I have to create a character in every server and start from scratch every time one server gets to busy to play on."
3,Move over LA Law,"was an interesting look at a system of law that I didn't expect. The side line of the affair got old, took away from the important lessons of how and why our systme of law and order evovled."
2,"Not the film with Slyvia Kristel, but man I wish it were.","This is a foreign film, not the 1981 gem that the viewer below mentioned and that is not available aparently anywhere. The one ""we"" are talking about had Howard Hessmen (may be the wrong spelling) of WKRP as the driver for the young rich boy. Man I would love to see it again."
5,Nadia and L.E.X. are an excellent mix,"Nadia expresses herself in such a sexy way with L.E.X. in this single and she sings so well to the rhythm. The beats are great and for those who are ""musically inclined"" you can almost feel the music and be in heaven at the same time..... Nadia's voice is very clear and beautiful as she sings ""la la la la - LA MIRADA"" which, combined with the trance sound variation of L.E.X., gives a sensation to the ears that makes this a wonderfully sweet track."
3,"Light Reading, Fun Subject","Not every book can be ""War and Peace,"" and this is a good example. Hardly literature, but a very fast-paced and entertaining ""beach read.""That being said, as historical fiction it isn't terribly compelling or convincing, but is written with great gusto that sweeps the reader along. Newcomb has an excellent sense of Texas, and is able to inject a definite Texas atmosphere into his writing.The plot is a fairly conventional tale of honor, retribution, and revenge--the hero is larger-than-life, of course, and the bad guys are punished in the end.Violence is prevalent, but not graphic; profanity is limited; sex is present but not explicit.Solid, rather old-fashioned storytelling. What's not to like? It was good enough to prompt me to read more books by Kerry Newcomb: ""Mad Morgan"" and ""The Legend of Mickey Free"" (which follow the same formula)."
5,puppies,"This is a GREAT toy for a litter of golden puppies! The see-through top makes it easy to see which one is inside. Even the adult dogs love scrunching through. It can be set up with different configurations; you can cover the entire top or a section and the end, too. Great pre-agility exercise and general confidence builder."
3,Not As Fun For My Son As I Had Hoped,"This product is definitely a toss up. I thought my son would love it since he likes to go under chairs but that is not the case. He's gone through it maybe a handful of times but it does not get played with much. It may be that it moves too easy and that makes him nervous. Finally, it is hard to put away."
4,Fun for my 1 year old,"Even though this is rated for a slightly older child, my 1 year old and his friends enjoy chasing balls through the tunnel and he loves the sense of accomplishment when he crawls all the way through. The see-through mesh is also great."
1,Leaky tire,"I had to put atube in the tire after a month, tire arrived leaking and never stoppedGet it somewhere else"
5,Good price and quality.,Replaced a leaking tubeless tire/wheel on True Temper wheel barrel. The fittment and quality was good. Makesure to measure and order the correct one as there are numerous sizes on wheel barrel tires.
4,Interesting and Different,"I would actually give this book 3 or 2.5 stars for the first few chapters then 5 stars for every other chapter. This book is set in a very different belief system then ours, based on birds, which is never really explained. It makes sense as the book goes along, but makes it hard to get into the story at first. It is a gloomy sort of slow to develope story, which does develope into a great story . . . if you stick with it. Its a good sort of Jane Eyre kind of gloom. Characters are not always what they seem, so stick with it and you will not be disappointed."
1,Truly Bad,"This book was absolutely painful to read. I don't often dislike a book that I am compelled enough to write about it, but this was really truly awful. The story would have been a great 4 page short story, instead the author dragged it kicking and screaming into a novel"
1,do not use product,DO not use this product!! Cause burns on my dog's retinas..bad product..keep your pet safe
2,DORKY HASSELHOFF,This movie needs more than david hasslehoff to make it watchable.The best scene is when you see the 2 nude girls walking outside.That was awesome! Besides that you better have your fast forward button handy or it will be a long 90 minutes.
5,As good as it gets,"There are a number of brands that offer roasting pans, but after buying and using this set, I am hard pressed to think of ways that the competition may excell. The tools are sturdy, and useful(!). The pan is built like it was destined for commercial service, and the rack is non stick. I know that the pan is offered in non stick coating as well, but for some things, I prefer the effect of anodized auminum or bare stainless steel. Roasting is one of those things. Gravy just works better in this environment. Clean up isn't too bad either. I have not tried it yet, but I'll bet that this pan would make a killer lasagna. It's the right size, and the characteristics of the thick aluminum casing seem to be ideal for the task. I'll append the result to this review in a week or two."
5,The best Gravy you will ever make!!!,"This pan is great!! I have used it to make turkey and Prime Rib. The meat never sticks to the roasting rack, it cooks perfect and the Hard Anodized pan makes the best gravy you will ever taste. I just bought one for my mother and one for my grandmother b/c they always rave about the gravy I make with my turkey."
5,Worth the money,My husband bought this pan and I thought he was crazy for spending so much on a pan. It was worth every penny! He loves to cook roasts which means I am usually the one cleaning up. None of the burned grizzle sticks to this pan. It just slides right off! The lifters are great too. The baster also has a pointy end and works as an injector too. Great pan! I highly recommend it!
4,"Good game , could be better","Pokemon Stadium is the best game I have played since Pokemon on Gameboy, The only thing that i dislike is that the sounds of the pokemon could be better and that if you use rental pokemon(already on N63 pak) The pokemon doesnt have the same attacks on the Gameboy. But still the Graphics take the cake, I would recomment it to anyone. Me and my brothers and friends cant stop playing it."
3,Not that good,"I think ""Pokemon Stadium"" isn't the best game nintendo made because if you didn't have the Pokemon game for game boy then you would just lose every battle you go into. I would rent this first before buying. I thought this was going to be a good game but it didn't turn out that way."
5,COOL...!!!!!,"My friend has this game and everytmeI go over to her house I beg to play it! *plese can we play, pleeeeeease?!* it is an awesome gameand I love 2P mode! also the Mini-Gamesare real cute. This is a must-buy game forpokemon fans. You will not be wasting your $$$'s!"
1,THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE!,"As a Pokemon fan, I had high expectations for a cool sounding game. However, after I got this game for my birthday, a day later I took it back because it's the worst game ever made. I would give this game no stars if I could. The graphics are terrible and blurry. It doesn't have all of the moves. If you have been considering buying this game, PLEASE, CLEAR YOUR MIND OF IT AND BUY SOME OTHER GAME CUZ THIS ONE IS TERRIBLE. YOU WILL WASTE YOUR DOLLARS ON IT."
1,CAN YOU SPELL STUPID,"Wow Pikachu just killed something... I'm getting goosebumps! The way that guy yelled out ""There is a difference in pokemon"" was just as cool as my Grandma talking about prunes! This game SUCKS! I spent about a day trying to like it. In all the Nintendo powers all you see are these 1000000000000000000000000000bit graphic pictures. The graphics are not good at all! It gets so boring after you see about 3 moves. Its also hard to start out without any good pokemon from your pack. The only place you can take pictures in is this field. Take my advice, keep your bucks, and don't buy this game!"
2,not great,"this game isn't great because all you can do is fight. you just push a button and hope your attak works. the grahics are great, but who cares. It's still boring. I would not recomend this game at all."
2,ITS OK,"I have played this I could not stop playing for a whole day,that was about it I still play it not nearly as much as when I gotit. There are only 9 mini-games. I didn't make that up I read it in my nintendo power. Only buy this if you must have every Pokemon game out on the market."
3,hmm should I buy or borrow?,"I have this game and I don't see its great the attacks look alright but don't touch the other pokemon. Its graphics are great and cheat codes are good. The game boy tower is nice but the lab is well just plain confusing and you need 2 controller paks to battle a friend in some areas. The kids zone is to hard for kids 5 and under, and to easy for kids 9 and up. If I were you rent the game first then if you LOVE it buy it otherwise get elmo."
3,Pokemon - Stadium,"Received in good condition and in timely manner, but don't have the correct platform to use it, so can't rate it properly."
1,"Boring and pointless, but you get a Gameboy adapter","Is it me or is this game really boring, repetitive commentary, pointless competitions, no advancement for beginners to masters, and even the ""fun"" little party games are quick and boring. There are several parts to the game, the challenge road where you go through six Pokemon categories each getting more difficult. There is the freestyle where you battle against other Pokemasters or your friends. There are even nine party games which get old very fast. You are supposed to use your own Pokemon from your Gameboy pack, but there is a way to cheat by using the rental Pokemon which comes with all 150 Pokemon (instead of having to earn them). Even children get bored quickly of the game. There is a good part to the Pokemon Stadium package, it comes with a piece of hardware that lets you play your Gameboy on the N64. This also is not a RPG like the Pokemon Gameboy games are."
5,People Who Hate Poke- Fighting Should Avoid This Game,"Shoot, how much fighting can a game hold? The game will smash, crash, mutilate, maim, injure, impale, crush, smush, bruise, batter, crack, bash, bang up, destroy, maul, throw, kick, punch, blow up, total, K.O., and most importantly, beat up your Pokemon. Ouch, huh? The attacks in this game are in glorious 3D, so that is a plus. But the sounds! Ewww! When they make their sounds, you're not sure whether it came from their mouth or the complete opposite. And when fighting a fire-type, it's like being in a japanese steakhouse. There should be a mode where you can choose to be cooked rare, medium, or well done. The game's graphics will amaze you, but it can get old."
2,NINTENDO COULD HAVE DONE ALOT BETTER!,"It may seem fun at first, but I'll tell you this: the more you get into it, the more you'll be surprised, on how boring it is! Really, all you do is battle. There's no real adventure, and I seriously regretted renting it. Printing out the pictures was nice, but that's all. All there is is the gym leader castle and tournament to do and they're practically the same. The mini-games are nice, but since there are only 9 of them and only 3 ways to play each, they get old after awhile. Believe me, if you buy it, you'll get seriously sick and tired of watching the same Pokemon just jump around and spit colors after one night. My recommendation is to rent it once or twice but never ever buy it. Believe me, 60 bucks is nowhere near worth it."
2,What about Gold and Silver?,"I say it alone: What about Pokemon Gold and Silver? They are not compatible with this game. So what will Nintendo do, put out a whole new version of this game, that will be compatible? If they do that, then they would have to include Red, Blue, and Yellow, and by doing this, Pokemon Stadium is out of the picture. Otherwise, the gameplay is great. The 3D graphics are astounding, but it would have been better if the Pokemon actually ATTACKED the other Pokemon, instead of making some kind of magical twirly move. Oh, and what about us more mature PokeManiacs? Those little games that can be played are nice...for 5 year olds. I man, c'mon Nintendo...I've been a faithfull gamer since the beginning, but I don't know if I can stand for this one. I give it a two. And, when the time comes to make a new Pokmon Stadium, I hope the developers at Nintndo acknowledge these points."
5,OUTSTANDING!,It is a very good pokemon game compared to the gameboy game in this you see all 151 pokemon in 3d. Also you can battle in different tournaments and play 9 different multiplayer games for example the Rattata run is who races to the goal while jumping over the hertles. Also you can battle against your self with the pokemon you caught.
3,Pokemon Stadium 1,"I have owned this game for years and if you are an original pokemon fan, you will enjoy it much more than if you started out on these, bizarre, new pokemon games they are releasing. The graphics in this game are not that great, but also to be expected since it is on the Nintendo 64 system. There are several different modes of play, including a gameboy connection so you can play pokemon gameboy games on the tv. There are also some cute minigames, and a few tournament modes to play as well. This game is alright overall."
1,Big Dissapointment,"Well this game sure was a dissapointment. I bought it thinking it would be like Smash Bros. in that one battled the pokemon like a real fight. But no, you have to abide to the traditional pokemon rules, and wait patiently while ur being attacked, then retaliate respectively. I found this game a true waste of money. 60$ (at the time) and the only thing different was improved graphics. I'll give it to Nintendo that when one trades through pokemon stadium it looks pretty sweet, but really its no different than the gameboy game. In my opinion, even with the price marked down, its an awful lot of money for mere graphic improvement."
2,Nintendo May Have Just Killed Pokemon,"Sorry Nintendo, but this is the FIRST Pokemon game I DIDN'T like! Why you ask? Because you do nothing but fight, there's no surprises, no special secrets to discover, and no travling around (Which could have really helped the game). Plues this game cost's ... more and doesn't even give you any real satifaction. This game wasted my money and time. And if you think I'm like other Pokemon haters, don't. I love Pokemon, I think it's a brillient game, show, and has a great card game! But this game is just so dry. I'm Pokemon, you need to make a better move next time you make a game for the N64."
1,a really stupid game,No different than fighting the blasted things on the game boy. Nintendo're just milking the fad.
3,A Good Game,"If you like Pokemon, you'll like this game. It has great graphics. You'll never have to worry about the battery running out, like in Game Boy. You won't have to worry about your opponent cheating. It has multiple settings, such as Stadium, Gym Leader Castle and Professer Oak's Lab. You can organize your items if you have a Game Boy. If you don't, you can always rent Pokemon. Overall this game is fun."
3,Pokemon Stadium,"Pokemon Stadium is a pretty good game, but a person will lose interest after awhile. It is nice to have some tournements and prizes for winning the tournements in the game. The game has an option where a person game play pokemon version red, blue, or yellow at triple the speed if a person completes certain things. This game is pretty good, but it gets boring."
4,Pokemon Stadium Review,"The Pros: This game has very good graphics, the best I've seen on Nintendo 64 so far except for several shots from Zelda. Second, this game is not just battling: you can play a few mini-games, check your items, and assemble effective teams. Third, it has various challenges, like cups and trying to get Mewtwo. Finally, you can play your gameboy cartridge pokemon game on the big screen t.v., courtesy of the transfer pak and pokemon tower emulator. It even has a speedup button so you can play the game at double speed! The Cons: Battle after battle and mini-game after mini-game makes you tired after a while. I rented the game and now I'm ready to give it back. Overal: Very Good, gets tiring after too much frenzied play."
3,pokemon Stadium,"It is a good game you can transer your pokemon from yellow,red,and blue. It is a good game for 5-10 year olds. There are diffrent modes you can play in. It can played in 4 player mode. I have owned mine for about 1 year I have played it alot and I still love it."
2,Play it at EB or Blockbuster...don't bother buying it,"As N64 games go, this one is pretty shallow. Basically, it's just a stadium on the N64 for you to do battle, rather than on your Gameboys. And you won't get the full capabilities of this game without having a Gameboy and either Pokemon Blue, Red, or Yellow. That means more money to shell out for those of you who haven't bought those yet, and a lot of hours to commit to developing your pokemon just to use them in Stadium. I admit that it was fun to look at the animations and all, but that gets old. And annoying. FAST."
3,This game has fun mini multi-player games!,"In my opinion the mini multi-player games are all this game has going for it. The mini games are GREAT! I give them 5 stars (I give the rest of the game 1 star) When I have friends over who don't like N64, or aren't good at playing it, I put in Pokemon Stadium! Everyone seems to love the mini games! They are easy to understand, and they are really fun to play! My favorite mini games are the Lickatong Sushi game where you run your Lickatong around trying to eat as may sushi's as it can is a minute. I also like the Run Rattata Run game where your race Rattata's. There are about 9 mini games in all, and the all the games are up to 4 players."
1,Makes Pong look like fun,What is the point of this game. To put you to sleep with pitiful battles between electron molecules. That's what I think. If you want a good game like that get Soul Caliber for Sega Dreamcast or Soul Caliber 2 for Nintendo Game Cube
1,"pokemon, too much pokemon",i bought it last week and was disipointed. i am tired of this poke stuff now after playing it. first off all u do is fight. secondly it sucks. is i wer u i would not get it.
1,Stupid Stadium,"What is this! There is supposed to be a big Pokemon game coming out with the best of everything. This game is nothing like that. I played it for 3 days, got board, and waisted my sixty dollars. The game is boring begause all you gan do is Battle and play some stupid games."
1,The Suckiest of the Suckiest,"This game is so fake. I can't believe that people could be so stupid to buy this sorry game. All you do is pick an attack and the pokemon will do it for you. You can't do it yourself. The grafics are also pretty bad because when you do an attack, you don't really hit them. I would rather stick my head in the trash dump for 15 minutes rather than turning that game on again. If I could give it away, I would gladly give it for free. In fact I'll even pay someone to take it."
3,pokemon stadiam,it was fun to play in the beginning then it got boring it also erased by game boy red pokemon game with all 150 pokemon
4,A Non-Pokemon fan is hooked,"Pokemon Stadium for the Nintendo 64 is a surprisingly good adaptation to the ever-growing Pokemon family. The graphics are good, and avoid being constantly the same through brilliant camera angles. The game is easy to just pick up and play, the controls are very simple. Even a non-fan like myself can play well without any Pokemon experience. Sadly, there are no four-way battles, but multiplayer still rocks. You can't use the game with Gold, Silver or Yellow and I can understand why that would be annoying. Stadium 2 will be out soon though, and if it's anything like the original, there could be another hit on the horizon."
1,tripe,"This album is total tripe. The singer's monotonous, off key voice over what sounds like someone pressed the demo button on a keyboard. If I ever tried to release an album like this I hope my loved ones would be kind enough to tell me that I couldn't sing to spare me of the embarrassment of having other people hear it. Luckily no one will really hear this."
2,Could be much better,"I have found the Zagat guides to be very helpful in the past. I'm from Utah and the rocky mountain guide told me about several hidden gems just blocks from my house. The other guides have been helpfull because there is not always a lot of good information on night life or restraunts from other sources. The Vegas guide is just too redundant. Other travel guides provide ample information on eating places in Vegas and are able to provide information on gaming, hotels and points of interest too for just a couple bucks more. The Zagat quaint pointers from surveyors are usualy helpfull and unique, however the ones in the Vegas guide are just too conflicting. Worth a read if you fall into one on the cheap, but spend a couple bucks more on a more comprehensive travel guide if you want some good restaurant info."
2,Not really up-to-date,"I own and use over a dozen Zagat guides, and I have come to respect and depend upon the reviews. So I was sorely disappointed to discover that the so-called 2000-2001 Survey of Las Vegas restaurants is actually a light update of a much older edition. Bellagio, Mandalay Bay and The Venetian have been open for some time now, yet their restaurants remain unrated (though mentioned) in this edition. The tremendous growth in the number of fine restaurants in Las Vegas over the past few years justifies an up-to-date survey."
1,Horrible,I purchased this watch over a month ago and stil have yet to receive. This company has horrible service and hate to put this but I am very displeased with the product I am a true star wars fan and I had been looking for a kick ass star wars watch and having to wait literally over a month and a half is a bit ridiculous and as for customer service maybe next time they should let me track my package so I know where it is instead of waiting all this time
3,wouldn't stick,"I don't know whether it is my car, or the device, but it would not adhere to my dash. I followed the directions and waiting over 24 hrs before attaching the nuvi, but within 8 hrs it detached."
3,garmin mount,"Unfortunately the mount arrived before the unit and when the GPS unit arrived, it included a holder which was eithr not noted or missed in the advertising. No rating-not needed but opened package so it sits in a drawer"
2,Garmin Nuvi 660,"The actual GPS unit would be ok but doesn't work long without a car charger. The car charger is a piece of junk and it fell apart the first time we used it. As of now the GPS is totally unusable. The 110v charger will charge the unit, but the charge lasted about 1/2 hour in the car. I don't need GPS to do a 1/2 hour trip."
2,Item received with missing components,"Item was returned because of missing parts (adhesive plates). Also, this item seemed overpriced for the quality. Ordered suction cup model for a few dollars more. So far, it's working very well."
1,Nuvi 660 mount (holder),"This product is designed to stick PERMANENTLY to a dashboard. It is not removable, so I will never be able to use it because my windows will be smashed regularly by thieves who believe that the Nuvi 660 is somewhere in the car!"
2,Didn't stick,"I brought this to use my Nuvi in a second car. The mounting comes with two types of sticky pad. The first did not hold the mount firmly on the dash at all, it just flopped over after a few yards of driving. The second one comes with so many ""health warnings"" about it being non-removable (eg even when you see the car) that I dare not use try it. Pretty disappointing."
3,Nuvi 660 In Arizona,"We used the Nuvi 660 driving throughout northern Arizona in the summer of 2008.The provided suction cup mount was abismal, failing to stay put during most of our 8 day SUV trip. I'd highly recommend the dash-based mounting kit.As far as directions went, we generally found it reliable, with caution.We did experience at least 3 wrong directional turns on our trip, however. We also found it prone to mis-directions anytime we deviated from the path it plotted. ""Recalculating, sometimes meant: ""Uh Oh!""Randy Hoff"
3,Problem Sticking to Dash,The mount will not stick to the dash in my Cadillac SRX. The dash is too grained. The friction mount should work better in holding the Garmin 660.
2,Garmin auto mount,This was a good bargain but turned out to be useless to me. I have a 2000 Honda Accord which has a plastic dash so this product would not stick to it. I also have a 2002 Jeep Liberty which doesn't have a lot of dash room so it didn't fit. However I was able to buy an extra window suction cup and combined it with the parts from my dash mount to make it work.
3,GARMIN NUVI DECK MOUNT,The product was unsatisfactory as received and i waited a bit long on my return rights but both AMAZON and GARMIN were most accommodating. I have experienced relief courtesy of the aforementioned and the Garmin Nuvi 660 is now a functioning part of my travel itineraries.I am most grateful to both of the aforementioned and would be happy to let anyone know that fact.
1,Not car surface friendly,"Unfortunately this product will not stick on the dashboard of a Mini Cooper for two reasons.1 ) the dashboard is curved enough that it presents a problem for the flat mounting surface2) the material surface of the dashboard is faux leather, so the bumps and grooves allow too much airunderneath the sticky pad. So I never got it to stick.I ended up using the glass mount, and this seems to work fine for now"
1,Why I don't need one,"I usually drive alone and when parking often remove my 660 and dropit in the passenger floorboard to avoid broken glass by thieves. Sometimes I haven't always remembered to reattach it to the windshield and found that it works fine from the floorboard or passenger seat. Yes, I do have a large windshield that slants well over the dash so it may not work for everyone but it works for me and on the seat it's easier formy short arm to reach the screen."
5,Garmin Auto Mount for GPS,The Garmin Automotive Mount for the NUVI 660 is really nice. It's low profile after the stem is removed is great! You can mount your garmin just about anywhere and it doesn't obstruct your view through the windows.Great product!
3,Too Thin,"I bought this thinking it was much wider so be aware that it is quite slim and light. But if you're looking for more of a Springtime accessory vs a Winter scarf, its a very nice piece."
5,Great deal!,Arrived 4 days ahead of estimated receiving date. Exact fit and part for $60.00 less than local auto parts stores for same brand and part!! I'm ordering from this vendor for all my parts from now on! Thanks for the great deal and customer service!
2,easy to install,"as stated, the item was easy to install. but my check engine light is still on and the sensor does not have a heat shield sleave"
2,13075 o2 sensor,"it does not fit my 1999 honda accord ex, wire harness is to short, wire connection is very tight and can very easily break, when your engine moves"
1,Wires too short!,Bought this for my 2002 Accord EX. The wires are way too short and wont reach the connector. Not direct fit.
2,POOR QUALITY AND WILL NOT WORK WITH LOREX CAMERA..,"I BOUGHT 3 OF THESE AND AFTER THEY GOT HERE I FOUND OUT THAT THE ROMOTE FROM,ONE MAKES ALL 3 MOVE AT THE SAME TIME AND WHEN I CONNECTED THE PAN SYSTEM TO MY LOREX CAMERA WITH THE POWER SUPPLY FROM MY CAMERA . THE PAN SYSTEM WOULD NOT WORK. SO I CONNECTED THE POWER SUPPLY THAT CAME WITH THE PAN SYSTEM AND THE CAMERA WOULD NOT WORK WITH OUT LOTS OF LINES AND RAINBOW SPOTS ON THE SCREEN."
1,I have to change my opinion about this device,"I used to like it, but this is my 3rd purchase and I am tired of forgiving my purchases. I pay extreme postage, then I wait and wait only to receive the items for them to work for a brief moment, then freezes up on me. Now I have a near 50.00 item that does not work. it is wireless and appears to be useless. Actually this is my 3rd item that has stopped working. I refuse to buy another."
4,Good product for the cost.,"This product works well for what I needed it for I can now watch the entire back yard as it pans. Although it sometimes sticks for just a second or so, but does well. It works well with the I.R. Camera I have. I would recommened this product."
4,SecurityMan Remote control pan base,"Great product. If you mount this high enough it will give you 360 degree watch area.Push the start button and it starts panning, hit the stop button and it stops on what you want to look at closer."
3,good,"compre esta base para adicionarla en mi sistema de seguridad, los primeros 6 meses trabajo bien, pero luego no retorna cuando llega al tope, siempre la tengo fija solo la giro cuando lo necesito."
2,SecurityMan Remote Conrol Pan Base for Camera ( PANBASE),Work great but i purchase two of them when i turn one both move so had to return one.New Security Man Panbase Remote Control Pan Base For Wireless Cameras Includes Mounting Bracket
1,junk,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS ! NO REASON JUST STOPPED ... BOUGHT 2 SORRY I DID ! BOUGHT SECURITY SYSTEM FROM SECURITY MAN HAD TROUBLE WITH THAT TOO ! I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ! VERY DISSAPOINTED !
5,Very Touching,"This movie is about an ongoing effort for an explorer (Enzo Simone) to raise awareness to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Real life stories about the struggles people with these diseases face...The explorer, Enzo Simone creates a symbolic ongoing adventure to climb 10 mountains in 10 years after his mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and his Father-in-Law has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease....very touching as he realizes unless he finds a cure for these diseases...he too could be afflicted...and the debilitating consequences would deprive him of the simple pleasures in life...such as sharing stories with his grandchildren....Absolutely tear jerking...to watch these people with their struggles as they try their very best and their only hope is just to survive.I expect to see additional documentaries on this as Enzo Simone completes his 10 Mountains in 10 Years expeditions...totally looking forward to seeing sequels to this documentary."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!,An amazing and moving film.....Really brings to light the need to raise more awareness for these two horrible diseases.Loved watching the ascent of Kili too....For anyone wanting to climb Kili this is a must watch...As well as giving you lots of insight to the Kili climb....You get to also help raise the awareness so desperately needed. Enzo you did suberb in this! LOVED IT!
3,Monkey Magnet,"Had some issues with the product. There were some slight imperfections, however seller kept good communication and resent the item for free. New product also had some superficial paint issues, but overall, the product is great."
5,Indispensible for Sanskrit Scholars,"I agree with the previous two reviewers. There is no need to search further. This is the definitive Sanskrit-English Dictionary to get. Not only are, as the previous reviewer wrote 160,000 terms defined, but there is also a reliable ""List of Works and Authors"", which I have found to be quite useful. Preface and Introduction are still quite readable after 100 years. This is truly an amazing feat of scholarship. My copy (Oxford Univ. Press - Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, India, 1993 reprint) has held together remakably well, thanks to careful usage and application of Elmer's Glue to the Binding (Thanks Jerry at South Asia Books). However, the paper is beginning to yellow badly and it is showing signs of becoming brittle. If you will be using this Dictionary frequently, in the long run, there is no savings in buying the Indian Edition. Therefore, my next purchase will definetely be the English Edition. - It's really worth it."
3,Two points,"1. The majority of words in this dictionary are provided in transliteration and a minority are additionally in devanagari script. This is a drawback as it requires learning of the transliteration conventions, it makes spotting words more difficult, and is a distraction all round."
2,low quality,Price is $200. However the quality of the printing just looks like a elementary student's work. Paper is very akward.I regret to buy this dictionary.
4,Very enjoyable set (but hopelessly padded out),"Another Dylan compilation done by here the group post their appearing at a Dylan festival and performing the set - very mood enhancing interpretations of some great Dylan songs (""Simple twist of fate"" and ""Its all over now baby blue"" especially) with a great vocal stylist in Kelly Flint who looked as though she would give the excellent Maria Muldaur set of Dylan love songs on ""Heart of mine"" a run for her money in the zone of bluesy jazz Dylan interpretations.However the bummer (and reason for 4 stars) is the padding out of the CD by inclusion of 2 versions of both ""Simple twist of fate"" and ""Its all over now baby blue"" and three of ""You're a big girl now""!Add a dispensable skat style version of ""If dogs run free"" and a group original ""Blood & bone"" and you are left wondering what might have been with a bit more discipline and adventurous spirit being applied by DTS."
5,Excellent Akido Primer,"This is an excellent book for all Aikido students. Easy to read and follow. Great book to understand what it is to start a martial art, espcially aikido. Basics are answered and this book will help you from your very first class. From dojo etiquette, how to fold your hakama, history, philosophy, basic techniques and waza."
1,Don't Waste Your Time With Aikido!,"Having studied under the late Bill Sosa for a year and a half, and after reading this book, I can tell you don't waste your time with Aikido. Except for the black and white pictures, and both the defender and attacker wearing hakimas which makes it difficult to see the foot placement, this is a great book. That's if you truly believe that multiple attackers will get tired and give up after you have thrown them multiple times without causing any permanent injuries to them. Instead, I would suggest studying Aiki-jujitsu and supplementing your studies with ""The Way and the Power: Secrets of Japanese Strategy"" by Fredrick J. Lovret. Only then, will you have a true understanding of the essence of Aiki."
5,$15.99 must be a misprint!,This is definitely in the class of Henckels ($80). Solid and nice looking. I purchased 3. What a great gift! It even comes nicely packaged. Definitely not a 'Chinese Cheapo'!
3,Won't fit in the block...,"So this is a good quality, basic fork. It won't fit in your knife block though since they made the tang a little too thick at the base. It functions but you'll have to drawer it instead of showing it off on the countertop with the rest of your collection."
3,Sweet but too much History,"This is a sweet book with some good characterization but it misses the point of the romance genre. The author tries too hard to teach us about medieval society instead of focusing on the relationship between the two main characters. The social history is very accurate, however, there is another genre for that. (just for example Sharyn Kay Penman's books)"
5,Heartwarming,"This wonderful book is the kind of Medieval that Julie Beard is so loved for. There are so many books that have stereotypic heros and heroines. Julie Beard's books always deliver realistic, complex characters that we care about as they overcome the obstacles of the plot. I loved this book. A heartwarming tale."
5,Very Nice,Definitely a nice knife. I really like the unibody and the blade is very sharp. Clean cutting knife.
4,"Pain to Install, but Good Overall","I don't know about the other OP systems, but if you are running Windows XP it is a pain to install!!! It took me 2 days before I got it running properly, and don't even think about calling tech support unless you enjoy being on hold for a half hour. When I finally got the software installed it worked out beautifully, I have not had any problems whatsoever with the adapter itself. So a few minor headached in the beginning with software installation but the over all performance of the adapter itself is excellent."
1,"Sent it back, now where is the refund?","I was very disappointed in this adapter. It was recommended to me to be used to allow my embroidery/sewing machine to communicate with my new computer. It was not compatible. I am not very ""techy"" however I did not read anywhere that it would not work with Vista. I promptly requested and received return instructions, which I followed exactly. That was @3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a refund. I'm very disappointed in the product as well as the company from which it was purchased. I do plan to stay on top of this since this item was not cheap."
5,Exceptional military memoir,"John Masters was an Englishman, born in India, educated in England and commissioned an officer in the Indian Army in the 1930s. I believe Masters went on to become a novelist in later life and the quality of his writing would support this. In this book he tells of his experiences as a young officer new to command in the 4th Gurkhas during the years leading up to the Second World War. Only a small portion of the book deals with his combat experience on the Northwest Frontier, today's Pakistan. This portion describes conditions very similar to what soldiers today are facing in Afghanistan. Most of the book deals with day to day life with his Gurkhas. Masters also wrote ""The Road Past Mandalay"" about his experiences during the Second World War which I plan to read and review next. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in military history or in the history of the British Raj."
1,Not the Calphalon Commercial Nonstick you're used to...,"The roaster looks like a cheap imitation of my other Calphalon Commercial NonStick cookware. I have about 20 pieces and I have been very happy with everything until now. The roaster itself is very thin and light--not heavy gauge like normal Calphalon Commercial NonStick. The handles are flimsy and the rivets are not of the same quality I am used to. The pan will actually flex under light pressure. The rack is not nonstick and I imagine it's a nightmare to clean. The ""lifters"" are very cheap construction and don't look like they can lift a chicken, much less a turkey. The baster/injection needle is fair. Overall, I am very disappointed in this purchase and I would advise anyone interested in it to look at it in a retail store before you buy."
2,Don't buy this pan,"I've had this pan for less than a year, and after 5 or 6 uses, I just threw it out tonight. After a couple uses, it ""buckled"", permanently -- that is, the bottom surface became severely unlevel and was pretty much useless on the stovetop. In addition to that, the nonstick surface came off the pan tonight, despite the fact that I've never used any metal tools in the pan.I did, however, give it 2 stars due to its size and convenient handles.Bottom line: don't buy this pan. It's flimsy and cheap, the surface comes off, and doesn't last a year. Save your money and get an All-Clad."
1,Don't buy this pan,"Despite the hefty price, this is a lightweight pan. The non-stick surface makes it a poor choice for dishes where you want to make gravy, since it does not develop ""fond"" (the tasty, crispy bits that contain most of the flavor in pan juices). Since it is so light, contents tend to burn easily. And somehow it doesn't clean as easily as most non-sticks, so there's no upside! I agree with the prior reviewer who advised sticking to All-Clad. I have had one other equally unsatisfactory Calphalon pan (which I donated to charity) and I will not buy another."
3,My least favorite of the YBB Live!,"These are my least favorite of the YBB Live! series. I was really looking forward to the Latin Flavor dvd when I ordered the set because I do a little Latin dance. I was pretty disappointed. There aren't many real Latin moves in this and no Latin rhythm. I actually like the Light & Easy a bit better. It is quite simple, but I really liked the yoga bit at the beginning and at least the dance in this one didn't annoy me. Frankly, I've hardly done either of these.If you're thinking about ordering YBB, I would recommend any of the other YBB Live! dvds over these: Hip Hop Abs, Cardio Cabaret, Body Sculpting Bollywood Style, or Go-Go."
3,"Loved Latin Flavor, hated Light & Easy","I love the YBB workouts because they are so much fun, it doesn't make working out seem like a chore. I keep coming back to them even if they don't make me drip sweat the way The Firm workouts do. The Latin Flavor is really fun and it's the only DVD out of this set that I use. It gets my heart rate up, but it isn't strenuous exercise. I enjoy the dancy aerobics and how they build the combination by adding on to the end each time through. The toning exercises at the end, ballet floor barre, are not common so they are a good challenge and good for variety.The Light & Easy is exactly what it says but I found that it was too light to be useful even on light days. All in all, I was satisfied with my purchase, because I like Latin Flavor so much."
4,Yoga Booty Ballet,This DVD is def different from other workouts...u will either really like it or hate it.
1,Lousy - did not work.,Bought this item through Target. Did not work at all (tried in 2 cars in in outlets where the lighter worked fine). Returned and purchased another brand.
1,Does not work on bike tires - don't bother with this,The product description specifically says it's suitable for bike tires. It did not work with bike tires. None of the 3 nozzles would fit bike tire valves.
5,spectra,"So I have been in the aftermarket parts buisness for a few years and know the name Spectra premium quite well. I sell their radiators, fuel sending units and other things. I have to say i was suprised that the price was almost half for what I sell it for. perfect product for perfect price."
2,"Great Production, Poor execution.","While the practitioner is obviously sincere and appears to have a solid understanding of Qigong, he does not have a gift for sharing it. I really don't see how any one could use this video on a daily or regular basis. There is simply too much verbal instruction and explanation. It's not condusive to quieting the mind and visualizing energy flow. There is no time where you are allowed to just follow a form. It's more of a lecture. If you have even the slightest grasp of the chi inside you and you are hoping to build on it, your $8 or $9 could be put to better use. This is the last video I would give to someone who was interested in Qigong."
4,great knives for the price,The previous reviewer said these knives arrive dull. My thumb disagrees. Sliced very cleanly through it! In spite of my wound I really like these knives. I thought they were well balanced and had a nice edge on them. I have only Chicago Cutlery and Cutco to compare them to. Calphalon Cutlery beats them both by a long shot. Probably ought to professionally sharpen them once a year and use the sharpening steel before each use.
1,bad game bad support bad plain and simple,"I own hot rod american street drag i must say compared to this 1 its way better. First of all if your running a socket a board dont buy this product it will not work. I tried getting support from the maker and no matter what they suggested it did not work, I tried it on a new dell duo core to my surpised it work but had many missing graphics and no support. My suggestion dont buy this game at all!!!! Buyers Beware!!!!!!"
1,Not worth the price for this little pot,"Emile Henry should discontinue making this little pot. It is so small that we cannot seem to find any practical use for it except maybe to hold some paper clips. Seems a waste for $45. If We had not lost the original box, we would probably return it for a refund."
4,Saleen car cover,This product is exactly what I wanted to protect my Saleen. The fit and finish are very good and the sale price was 60% less than other covers I had looked at.
4,TRY IT,ONE OF THE EASIEST BOOKS ON A DEEP SUBJECT THAT I HAVE RAN ACROSSAND TRUST ME I HAVE TRIED QUITE A FEW. I CAME AWAY THANKFUL THATI FOUND A BOOK THAT EXPLAINS THEORY OF RELATIVITY SO I COULD ATLEAST THINK I UNDERSTOOD IT. BUY THIS BOOK.GENE ADDINGTON
4,A Village of teachers,"I was so excited as I read through the pages of Catch a Fish. My boys and I are going to have so much fun together in the years to come. But it will take a village to teach my boys all the activities in this book! I read the exhaustive instructions on fishing. It was obvious Lee loves it, but I never will. So call all your village people to pony up and promise to teach the kids something! The memories made while learning are worth more than the skills themselves."
1,Too bad!,We ordered these thinking they would compare to 2 chairs we already have. After putting them together they both wobbled but one of them was so bad we couldn't even sit on it. After several emails and several weeks we finally got a new leg sent to us. It is a little better but still wobbles. We are so disappointed in them that we are just looking for new chairs. I would never recommend them to anybody. I wish we never ordered them!
4,Good purchase,Every thing I expected in a vest. Could be a bit longer but otherwise a great fit. Knitted collar grabs my unshaven face every once in a while.
1,not useful,"It has no difference with other weighted clubs, I hurt my back by swing it and sold it on EBay for much less money."
1,Poor customer sevice,"The battery was said to be a 8800ma, when in fact it is a 4400ma battery. I called and e-mailed the company with no response. Looks like I'm stuck with a battery that I did not want."
2,Quite dated and not very helpful,"I found this book to be very outdated -- apparently it was written in 1976 and it definitely reflects the times. Of the discussed problems, the closest thing to ""a lack of desire to have sex"" was termed ""frigidity,"" which is offensive and very superficial. This book is not for people who have real problems feeling sexual. It is very simplistic and unrealistic in that it suggests masturbation as a beginning step to increasing sexual desire. As a therapist myself, I believe this suggestion trivializes the legitimate problem of sexual dysfunction due to lack of desire by assuming a person would want to do these things but just doesn't know how. This book may prove useful to couples who simply need a little kick to their sex life, but not for people with bona fide problems, in my opinion."
5,A helpful and fascinating book. Solve problems easily.,"I read this book because I saw Dr. Altman on a national talk show. She is as interesting in person and as informative as she is as a writer. I find her to be very intelligent and easy to listen to, and her instructions easy to follow. Her techniques are simple to follow, and her ideas really work. My wife and I are much happier since we've begun communicating, follow Dr. Altman's directions, and my wife has learned to be able to let go and relax so that she can climax more frequently and more easily. If you get a chance watch for Dr. Altman on TV, she seems to be on various shows and is worth looking for. Thanks for the book. Doug W."
5,A must have!!,"This book deserves all the lovely reviews it has gotten. It is a wonderfully written book. Read it with the understanding that everything worth living is a ""project""; in short this book has very wide application."
5,Basie and Peterson,"These two are brilliant.. No surprise here. What sets this project apart is John Heard on bass. His contribution has caused me to listen to this CD a lot.. I don't believe the bass is overbearing at all, however it is up in the mix enough where you can hear the little things he does. Very, very nice. Highly recommended.So You Want to be a Soundman: Basic Sound Reinforcement for the Interested Novice"
1,Count Basie and Oscar Peterson,"What a disappointment! The album, which should SWING, does not. The first track with the over emphasized bass sets the scene. I am very upset as this should have been something really special. Imagine ...... Count Basie AND Oscar Peterson!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wow!!!!!!!!!! And one gets this rather dull album!!!"
3,Accounting: Text and Cases,"Generally a great text BUT some concepts are glossed over a bit quickly, e.g. Bonds, Adjusting entries. The problems at the end of the chapters are appropriately challenging but there are no answers. You gotta have answers somewhere, perhaps a web site. The print is too light and difficult to read with overhead lights."
2,This one will make you pull your hair out!,"Unless you go to Haaaaarvaaard (I always forget how many A's to put), you are probably going to be a bit perplexed by the content of this book.The cases go WAY beyond what is covered in the Chapters, and its up to the instructor to try to fill in the gaps (hopefully your instructor realizes this).I have found myself referring to my textbook from my intro accounting course more often than this book itself in order to grasp the concepts at hand. Seriously, this book is a punishment to anyone who has to buy it for school. And its FREAKIN heavy to haul around across campus.'Nough said."
1,Too Lenghty,"If you are looking for an introductory accounting book, this is not the one you want to buy. I am attending an accounting pre-course for an MBA and this is my official text-book. It's very lenghty and it makes concepts hard to understand. Sometimes you just wish the book would tell you what you need in plain english. In addition, there are no solution to the problems proposed at the end of each chapter. If you are getting them wrong, you wouldn't even know!"
2,"Hey, I used to LIKE accounting!","I am here at Amazon to find a decent supplementary Accounting text so I can survive this term and pass the exam. This text, offcially assigned for my MBA program, is hopeless. The language is opaque. Terminology varies from page to page. There are mistakes throughout (10th edition) that even students can spot. The examples are confusing. The graphs are unhelpful. It even makes T accounts look difficult!The clearly-brilliant authors claim to have written this book for the USERS rather than the creators of financial statements. What they forget is that they already understand accounting. Students generally don't.I enjoyed undergrad accounting and thought I understood the principles. Ten years later, it is very disappointing to be so confused by this unfortunate textbook."
4,My reference in Accounting,This title is the most important one in my library when it comes to accounting. It really covers everything I need to know within the subject. No problems with understandability or annoying typos either. Recommended as a first buy.
1,Beyond unacceptable,"Verbose and useless! The book says that the only way to learn accounting is to practice doing problems. It sucks at showing you how to do problems. It sucks worst at teaching you the concepts. No matter how many technical or engineering degrees you may have, this will make you feel stupid."
1,A teaching aid ONLY for the authors of the book,"This book does not create a bridge between the chapter material and the problems/case studies at the end of the book. Very tough to learn the concepts in the book using the end of chapter material. No answers to questions, so no way to tell what the correct answer actually is. A good teaching aid for the authors of the book, but I do not recommend this for students or professors outside of the author's circles."
2,Doesn't work with Marshall or any other Brand,"Beware buyers, I bought this to use with my Marshall MG30CD amp, and to my dismay it did not work AT ALL. It only works with a Fender amp. however, if you are looking for a foot-switch to just switch from Clean to Distortion, just get the one button Fender foot-switches. They are on Amazon and actually work with Marshall and other brand amps."
2,Psychological / Sociological study,"The destruction of the world was just meant to set up the drama concerning how various men would treat women if there were no law to influence their behavior. We have Jasper the brute, who only wants to possess the woman. A fearful creep who wants to violate her and the decent man who wants to love her. Primitive but interesting because of the age of the film."
1,Very Little Nudity,"If you are looking for some great topless shots of Samantha Fox like you used to see in her calendars, you will be very disappointed. Although Samantha is topless in the video, which centers on her making a new calendar, those magnificent mammories are almost always obscured. There is one clear shot of her topless for about 15 seconds, but it is definitely not worth the price of the video."
3,Okay Shoe,"Ordered this shoe. Fast shipping. When the shoe came, the heel did not look like it was 2 1/2 inches. Also, the combination of snake and crocodile skin did not go. The shoe looks a lot better in the picture... however, had it not been on a major sale, I would not have purchased it. The shoe however is very comfortable. I'd wear it out still. :)"
2,Very flimsy.,"I was running around outside with my brother and my dog. For a moment, my brother grasped a bit of the armpit section of the shirt, and with almost no pull at all, he managed to tear a grapefruit-sized hole in the material. I've had Smartwool shirts stand up to substantially higher levels of abuse than this minor torquing. This shirt is just too flimsy for me, and my $30 wasted will be better put towards a higher quality shirt."
4,Memories,Good movie that brought good memories. It was fun to reminisce about high school days and friend interaction with imagination
4,Prophetic science fiction,"Forster wrote this book some time before 1914, which is utterly astonishing when you consider the society he portrays in this novel of the future. Flying ships, automated machinery run by computers (although he does not use that word), robotic equipment to maintain and repair society's hardware, are all in their infancy even today, almost a century later. This is science fiction that could have been written in the 1960s or 1990s. I read this book in the early sixties, and assumed at the time that it was contemporary, not realising that it was written before World War 1. I was very pleased to find that it was still available in reprinted form. Highly recommended."
5,Truly prophetic,"It's amazing to think that this story was written nearly a century ago, when most of the machinery that currently runs our lives hadn't even been invented yet. My son's heading off to college to major in electrical engineering. He'll be working on the Machine, and I'll be sending this story along with him to keep him grounded(sorry about the pun)."
2,"Absorbing story, distracting edition","I won't go into the merits of the story (I remember it as H.G. Wells meets Isaac Asimov, which counts as high praise)--the main problem with this purchase is that the edition is pitiful. This press (is it even a press?) appears to have discovered that The Machine Stops had passed into the public domain and scrambled so fast to get an edition on the market that they failed to run it past a copy editor, let alone a graphic designer or literary editor. If you're like me and consider books aesthetic objects as well as delivery systems for literature, you might find it worth splurging on the Dodo Press edition and avoiding the CreateSpace copy. Otherwise you might shell out the 99 cents for the Kindle edition, I guess."
2,expensive short story,"I had read this book many years ago and enjoyed it. The book was written 100 years ago, but does hold some truths of the world today. However, it appears to be a reproduction, the book was rather expensive for what I got - a slim paper back full of typo's"
1,The Machine Really Never Stops,"The Machine Stops is quite possibly one of the most long and dried out pieces of literature I have ever read. This story doesn't even come close to grabbing your attention. In fact, it took me multiple attempts just to get past the first three pages. I could not help but fall asleep. It is my opinion that Mr. E.M. Foster should know his role and shut his big mouth."
5,Great CD,Love it! Fun for kids and not annoying for the grown ups who get to listen to it over and over... although you will get Blubber is Beautiful stuck in your head.
5,"singable, educational, multi-age hits","My kids, ages 8 and 4, can't stand ""baby music"" that talks down to them or embarrasses them with squeaky voices and silly sound effects. That's why they love Good Dog. It's real music, well-performed, with a folk flavor that adults enjoy, too. Every song works as fun music, while managing to pack in (subtly) some light science/ecology information. The animals and environments covered are all found in coastal Alaska, so if you're a wilderness lover or teacher planning an Alaska or shore ecology unit, this would make a good component. Finally, the back-up instrumentation is top quality. As a family, we have rated dozens of kids' CDS, and this one is in our top three. My son knows every ""Good Dog"" lyric by heart."
1,What a joke,"There are a huge number of misspellings and math errors in this product. I was completely and totally disappointed in this. 9*6 = 45. I don' this so but this program had this as part of a solution to a problem. It asks data sufficiency questions and does not tell you it is a data sufficiency question. There are other questions where you have to look at the solution just to figure out what they were asking. Some of the questions that they count as GMAT questions are at a 5th grade level and if you can't answer these without doing a math review don't bother with the GMAT. In addition, the program is excruciatingly slow. Do not buy this product. Get something from Kaplan or Princeton Review."
2,was hoping for more,I expected a whole book full of fabulous quotes from a fabulous author but for some reason most of them are kinda lukewarm. I was disappointed.
3,tiny tumbler,"hard to get an audible noise out of this little rig without hurting the fingers, but its fun for the kids and wont hurt your ears."
5,addition to grandson's musical experience,My three year old grandson loves having a conga just like grandpa's. It sounds good and is just his size.
3,More than a drum,"This drum got me the gig with the cool kids drum circle, no more playing with dweebs!"
3,First hand account of cinemas birth,"I found this to be a very interesting book, mostly because it is a first-hand account of a man who helped invent the cinema. Written in a humorous vain, Albert Smith recounts the behind the scenes stories of backstabbing and espionage that took place on the sets of films that are largely forgotten or lost. If you're a fan of the early days of film, this one is a must read."
3,Nice but confusing book,"The descriptions in the book were appropriate and accurate but the photos were mostly of baths in California! I was really hoping for more photos of actual Japanese baths in Japan, and was confused by the choice to include many California baths."
5,the Japanese bath,The book the Japanese bath gives the history and the culture of the Japanese bath. Fabulous pictures which show the peace and beauty of the Japanese bath. A must-see and read for anyone contemplating building a bathroom.
4,good,"These are good, and not chocolately sweet, good texture if you want something other than chocolate."
5,A wonderful resource book for massage,"I greatly enjoy this book. It has proven to be a wonderful addition to my book collection. The many pictures make this a very clear to understand and educational book. It has a section that covers anatomy, which is very helpful when giving a massage. Also it talks about how to prepare yourself to give a massage. The section on oils is very informative and usefull. I would recomend this book to anyone who is interested in giving a better massage."
4,Massage,"I felt that though the instructions are well illustrated and that topics covered are very inclusive, the description of the techniques are somewhat elementary."
1,Not what I expected...,"This book is a joke for even an advanced amateur....certainly not for anyone serious about massage therapy. Very unprofessionally done...couples might enjoy, but if that is the type of book it is inteded to be then it should promoted as such."
4,Solid Practice,"I passed the CISSP examination in NYC last month and used this book as part of my practice drills. I mainly used the practice CD. The book itself is the practice CD in paper form. The questions Gregg asks are specific, yet challenging, and push your level of understanding of the 10 domains. The CD engine works fine, but the ""mark"" feature had a few issues at the end of a quiz. Overall, I believe that this CD isolated my weakness very well in relation to other quiz engines, so I knew exactly what I needed to spend more time on. The questions on calculating ALE and SLE were useful and applicable in a real world sense. Combine this book with Tittel, Harris and ISC2 study guides and you should really have a command of the material."
3,The questions are good to a point,"I used this book to help prepare for my CISSP exam. The questions are good (I found a few minor mistakes), but they don't cover all of the content that is on the exam. The term that is often quoted about this exam is: ""The CISSP is one mile wide but only one inch deep."" This book is about one-half mile wide. I recommend the book, but a CISSP student will need an additional test bank to fill in the gaps missed by this book."
5,A Touch of Wow!,"As a huge Charles Williams fan, I can say without question, this is not only one his best books but one the best in the Hard Crime genre. Written in the 1954 but still timeless. A real corker of a read with all the noir elements including the classic femme fatale. Plenty of action and excitement but also a psychological thriller too."
3,"Informative, but dated","Good footage and information about the industry. However, released in 2005, many of the names will be unfamiliar and/or dated to a younger crowd. Even though the case says ""not rated,"" cuss words drop quite a bit. Teachers wanting to show this to a class may want to first preview the film. (when will production companies realize they can expand their audience if they would make product viewable by everyone!)"
1,Just not for me,I jsut could not get into Mr. Pim Passes By. Maybe the timing isn't right. I found this hard to follow and choppy. It didn't 'grab' my interest at all.
4,Like a good old movie,"This book is a fun look at another time told by a fine storyteller. The language is so different from today that it was very interesting to read. The story is sort of a Thin Man type of story, not alot of surprises, but clever enough."
5,Passionate and eye-opening!,"Superbly researched and well-argued analysis of how the Kennedy ""mystique"" took hold. The interviews and anecdotes presented are quite revealing in their own right. By far, this was the best book I have read on Kennedy and his political legacy to date. A must read for anyone seeking to understand how Kennedy's image has helped shape American politics over the last few decades and why it persists today."
3,"Thoughtful, useful, with a couple omissions","A very thoughtful reference work. The country-by-country profiles in the second part of this work are particularly useful. Overall well balanced, but notable for a few of its omissions, including The Patent & License Exchange (pl-x) itself!"
2,what order are the places listed?,"The information was fine, but everytime we wanted to find out about a museum or anything else we had to go through the whole section again because we could not figure out how the places were organized. Each region was separated but with no other organization. Varied headers were used without rhyme or reason and items were not in an order we could discover."
2,Helpful but lacking Up to Date Information,"I learned some basic facts but kept asking myself what today's statistics would be, and had these denominations changed their stance since the book was written. The book is constantly using figures and information from the 1970s. I now make it a point to look at the date a book was written before buying."
2,This Book Is Way Outdated,"Overall, this is a good book; however, I found the information to be way outdated. It also left out a lot of religions in my opinion. The date of print on this book is 1975 so I do not get where they say the NEW? I found a much better book that was updated; however, this book does have some good historical information."
4,A Heartwrenching Tale,I have read this book several times and it affects me deeply each time I read it. My heart breaks for Mari Winzen and Jude Govreau. I thought the book was written in a very compassionate matter. It was a horrible tragedy from the beginning but it was made worse because the mothers had to wait almost two years for an arrest and then there were constant delays before there was a trial. Mari and Jude walked the road to hell and made it back in one piece and I have a lot of admiration for them.
2,Are all murders this confusing?,"This was an awful experience for two mothers to go through. Children brutally murdered and endless problems abounded. It makes you realize justice is not always swift and easy. I don't see how the mothers survived without killing someone themselves. It was a difficult read at times, trying to remember the aka's of protected sources, and other information was confusing. There were what I think were errors but there was no way to confirm. I do think a better job could have been done with the writing considering the important subject matter. All and all it did tell you what happened."
2,very little information,this book has very little information in it. When I got through reading this book I was shaking my head wondering. There was very little information about this crime. All I learned was that two beautiful children were murdered & their mother's did everything they could to find the murderer & have him or them punished.
4,Great golf pin for the backyard!,This pin is sturdy and the cup is easy to install. It looks great in our field and we love having a one hole course in our yard. The only complaint is the flag is flimsy and started fraying after a few days outdoors. Overall for the price it is a great product.
4,good but not as good as 2 layer,"I like these better than the larger sardines from Portugal or Morocco, but they are not as good as the even smaller 2 layer pack brislings. The 2 layer cross pack are the best. The extra seasoning in these neither adds nor detracts from the taste -- I can take it or leave it. In all cases an olive oil pack is superior to water, fish oil, or some cheapo oil (cottonseed, soy, etc). It's really too bad that the Tiny Tots are so hard to find. They always were the very best,by far."
2,King Oscar packed in Poland,"King Oscar and Bumble Bee sardines are both packed in Poland. Bumble Bee is the distributor for K.O., and I believe both brands come from the Mediterranean instead of the icy Nordic waters. K.O. 3.75 oz tin costs $3.79 retail and B.B. cost $1.69 where I shop."
5,I should move to Sardinia,Didn't really like sardines much till I found these. Now I eat them all the time with salad and walnut oil dressing. Hope they come back in stock soon.
3,Not my favorite M&D puzzle,We have several of the M&D floor puzzles for our 3 year old son and this is by far my least favorite. The pieces are not shaped like normal puzzle pieces and some of them don't interlock well. It is definitely not up to the usual M&D standards. Our son won't even play with it anymore and this is going to be the first puzzle we put in the donate pile. Get the giant fire truck instead.
5,Definitely for the 3yo end of the age spectrum,"My 4yo is just now starting to let these puzzles collect dust after a year of fun with putting them together. He got them for his 3rd birthday and quickly figured out how to seperate the pieces and put them together. Note, this is 4 puzzles each with 12 pieces! Over the past year I can't count the number of times my child has put these puzzles together and I don't even see a bend in the pieces. And now his younger brother (2 1/2) is starting to eye them and I'm sure will soon be putting them together. I expect the pieces will continue to last through him as well."
1,"Be careful! This is actually 4 separate 12-piece puzzles, NOT a single 48 piece puzzle","This is really only appropriate for very young children. 5+ wouldn't enjoy it. The name on the box is misleading-- it's not one puzzle- it's 4. I could have picked that up if I had read the description more closely, but who thought getting a kids puzzle should require such diligence?"
2,Pieces do not fully interlock,"My son really likes these puzzle, but he get very frustrated with them because a number of the pieces just sit next to each other and don't click into each other the way he expects(the way puzzles normally work). He tells me ""they don't fit."" Its annoying for both of us. As soon as I can replace this puzzle with a comparable set of transportation puzzles, I'm throwing this one out."
3,Not THAT great,"This is more for the beginners. If you've read and understood the manual, then you don't need this book. It's just the same again more in depth and with more tutorials. The special features not mentioned in the manual (like flocking..) are kept very short in here. The online help of the software should often be enough. If you didn't catch the idea with the manuals explenations then.. buy it!"
5,Very easy to understand and learn by !,"Most books I get are thick and full of content but most of the time only 30% or so of the content is helpfull if at all..... So far I must say this AM Handbook 2nd Edition is the best book I've had for any particular product.... Other books I have had for other products seem like they were written by a person who really doesn't use the product but was just given the task to write about it, if you know what I mean ..... But this AM handbook is so different...... Kinda a jump-in and go book, read it ...... do it ..... next page :)This book has been helpfull and teaching me alot with new perspectives on methods to use and how you do-its in areas from modeling to decaling!My thanks to Jeff for a great book and I recommend it to anyone !Brian R. June June3D Designs"
4,Thank you Jeff Paries!!!!,"This book is amazing! It takes off from where the MH3DPRO manual falls desparately short. The manual teaches the 3D basics to a complete 3d novice, but I thought it fell short in teching the great animation tools in 3DPRO; the handbook fills this sport quite nicely, and teaches you all the advanced tools in 3DPRO. The only reason I didn't give it a 10, is the lack of spiral binding (a MUST for any manual). Great job Jeff, thanks."
3,You need it; it's sloppily put together,"If you own the program Animation:Master, you need this book in order to excel at some of its advanced features.Many of the figures, are sloppy and it's hard to tell exactly where the control points are. Also, the text is lacking in its descriptions of exactly what to do. Nevertheless, you may be able to learn a great deal despite this book's shortcomings."
3,Makes many of the same assumptions as the A:M manual.,"I had some of the same problems using this aftermarket manual as I did trying to use the original, worthless A:M manual-and then it created some new problems of its own. Example: neither book includes anything resembling a ""quick-start"" guide, that is, a straightforward no-options approach to get a quick, trouble-free 3D result right off the bat. Oh no. Too simple. The official manual doesn't even reveal how to draw a line onscreen until page 199. The Paries book starts its modeling tutorial earlier, on page 47, but does it by handing the reader a prebuilt model off the included CD-ROM. How does that teach anyone how to design a 3D model?If I ever learn how to use this software, I'm going to write my own doggone handbook."
2,"Be aware reviews before June 5, 2000 are not for this book!","I just wanted to make everyone aware that reviews done before mine are NOT for the book listed here, and I have not bought this book. I bought the Animation:Master Handbook, Second Edition which covers through Animation:Master 98, and THAT is the book that reviewers up to my review are commenting on.I had problems early on with the Animation:Master Handbook, Second Edition as some steps in completing projects were either missing or unclear. I'd still have to work through later projects to see if the book improves. Hopefully this new book is more complete than the last one. With books like these I feel you really have to be spoonfed every key stroke or something gets lost in the translation. I don't care if that looks like the author is talking down to us...he knows a lot more than we do!"
3,"I love Garrison, but wanted more","I love Prarie Home and Garrison, and this is a great collection. However, it is all music and Tales from Lake Wobegon - none of the other sketches or comedy routines I was hoping for. So, no complaints about what's on the four CDs - just complaints about what's not! I will try one of the other anniversary collections!"
3,Good For Background Information,"This book contains descriptions of various careers that the author believes are hot, and includes links to sources of additional information. That's the good news. I would caution any reader to use this book only as background information for brainstorming. Many of the careers singled out in the book are difficult to get into and/or are very geographically limited. The descriptions of the careers in the book do not carry that caveat, and they should where applicable. Readers should identify what their career objective is and not just pick up this book and try to leap onto the bandwagon of a ""hot"" career."
4,Interesting source of finding what jobs are out there.,"Several careers I had not thought of.Sources for the associations involved with the careers were in the back of the book.I would probably purchase the current issue of theOccupational Outlook Handbook 2006-2007 by (Jist Works).Dated, but an interesting read."
2,A purchase I wish I had not made...,"Two stars is an exaggeration. I was surprised that this music did not comprise of anything which stuck with me. It was way too unstructured for my listening pleasure. I do not mind when musicians go into the studio/session without any preconceived ideas or even framework for the songs (LTE, Bozzio, Levin & Stevens, & Attention Deficit are all examples of pure genius for an outcome w/o having things written or rehearsed prior to). The actual sound of the guitar almost sounds like an additional saxaphone at times. Some of the musicianship is worthy. Yet I am now looking to get rid of the CD I purchased (and that is saying a lot)!"
2,It's for idiots who'll never learn tennis.,"If you want to learn basic strokes of tennis, forehand, backhand volley and serve, forget about this book. This guide contains no more than 10 pictures/illustration of an old lady with a racket. I have no idea how you can learn highly complicated movements from a paragraph of description. Some tips offered in this book are old and wrong.Visual Tennis is a much better book for learning how to PLAY tennis. Tennis for dummies gives a better overview of tennis."
5,I'm in the Danger Zone........,This CD is worth it alone for the 2 demo sessions tracks recorded prior to the Danger Zone 45 release. The live tracks are recorded very well in fact I like some of these live versions better than the actual original 45 versions.
5,Don't leave home without it!,"This book covers the training of Ahlerich from the horses purchase up to winning an Olympic Gold medal. Dr. Reiner Klimke shows the sensitive, always thoughtful handling, that went into the training of this great horse. He explains in detail why he did things a certain way with this particular horse. Like a Diamond cutter with a precious stone, Dr. Klimke was ever careful to preserve the brilliance and purity of movement that Ahlerich was blessed with. How easily one careless touch of the spur or jab in the mouth could destroy all this brilliance forever. Dr. Klimke was the best!"
3,Doughmakers 10 Piece Pie Bakeware Set,"This is a great line of bakeware, but I did not get all the pieces! The pie crust protector was missing from the set."
4,Bakugan DVDs,"Bought these for my son for his birthday. Items arrived on time and as described. He watches these so much I think the DVDs are starting to wear out, lol!"
5,"As a daughter of one of the artists, it has a unique style","I have heard many different bluegrass albums, being the daughter of a bluegrass musician. The album is Newton & Emerson, and their ""friends"" (my dad is a friend) at their best. The unique style of songs which they have redone, and the original songs are incrediable. They are even better live. I love the use of the many different instruments and the harmonies in the group. ""The Singer,""is one of my personal favorites, not only because my father sings lead vocals, but because it has a very sweet message behind it. These men are on their way to being known in the. Bluegrass music industry ."
3,A difficult read,"The title of this book, should be ""Ballistics"". There is little information on the actual wounds, but more on the grains and callibers of the bullets. The book has black and white photos, which makes it very difficult to see stippling, powder burns and soot. You will learn detailed information about bullets and the brands (if you can rememeber all that), unfortunately, not much more."
1,I HATE IT ! DONT BUY IT!,"You said there would be Jeter,Pujols,Ichiro and other stars that is a lie.It was a rip off I will never buy from you again."
5,"Milt Buckner's ""After Hours""--a neglected classic","When I was learning to play R&B; and jazz guitar, the soul station in Jacksonville, Florida was WOBS. It was an AM station, that's how long ago. The theme song for their midnight show was Milt Buckner's ""After Hours."" It was the most effective mood-setting, funky, swinging tune I'd ever heard. I taught myself to play it on piano, which took awhile, because I could only hear it once a day.That tune, and the tenor sax / guitar ensemble, pointed the way forward to all the great stuff performed by the organists who came along in the mid-sixties and later. OK, part of my 5-star rating is personal nostalgia. But I'll say this: if you listen to just two tunes--this tune, and to David Newman's introduction to Ray Charles' ""The Night Time is the Right Time""--you will get a great picture of the soul jazz idiom, in a very short time."
2,Predictable but semi-engrossing thriller.,"Christopher Reeve is a priest who has a killer confess his crimes to him. Pretty pathetic result, though the premise is intriguing. At least Reeve gives (finally) a decent performance. Too slow for thriller fans and too dull for drama fans. You be the judge, but wait 'til this airs on TV or cable instead of wasting your money on it (except if you are a Christopher Reeve fan)."
5,Great Pants,"These pants are great for anyone tall and thin. I'm 5'4"" and weigh 105 pounds. Size small fits me great with plenty of length. 32"" inch inseam is hard to find in my size. Super comfortable too. And talk about fast delivery... it took like one day to get here and that was with standard UPS shipping. Thank you UPS..."
2,Plan on NOT putting them in the dryer,"The pants fit good and are nice and long......untill you wash and dry them. Mine shrank at least 2"" in length and are now too short. The directions say to dry on low but I didn't realize that this meant fluf/air dry! My advice, if you are going to buy is to line dry them, but who wants to do that?!"
1,Made in china,"I'm so regrets the shoes is not made in usa but is made in china,I will be very if the shoes is made in usaMen's Red Wing Brett Oxfords"
5,"""P{lank"" and a small band - Heaven",If you like Count Basie and his big bands or orchestras then you'll love the smaller version. Excellent recording that highlights individual musicians.
5,Track Listing,"1. Oh, Lady, Be Good 2. Secrets 3. I Want A Little Girl 4. Shoe Shine Boy 5. Count's Place 6. Senator Whitehead 7. Tally-Ho, Mr. Basie! 8. What'cha Talkin'?"
3,Aerobically Fit,"Fun songs, but a little slow for what I wanted. Great for aerobics, not so good for running or cardio."
4,ICE AGE CHARACTERS,"THIS WAS A VERY HARD ITEM TO SECURE IN THE MARKET AND I RECEIVED THIS IN A 1 SHAPE, QUICKLY. VERY SATISFIED. MY GRANDSON IS ENAMOURED BY THIS MOVIE."
5,Have used for years...work great!,"I have used these little rubber stoppers for years and as far as I am concerned they work great. I haven't found an earring yet that they will not fit over the metal stud and really hold the earring in place. I find them to be comfortable...don't even know they are on the earring. I don't just use them for earrings...I also use them to add another level of security on pins/brooches. I slide one of them onto the piece that goes through your clothing and then secure the clip. I was constantly having pins/brooches work themself loose and fall off without my noticing. I have not had that problem since I have starting using one of these little rubber back stoppers. Also, I have not lost an earring since using these...and I certainly lost plenty of earrings before."
2,earring stoppers,I was not happy with the product because the holes in the stoppers are too small for most fish hook earrings.
2,Holes way too small,The holes are way too small for most earring wires. If using w/thin wires be careful not to bend the wires.
2,Inconvenient for older adult usage...not baby boomer friendly,"The picture showed color of backs as white, but received clear. These were purchased for an older person who uses reading glasses to see. The clear colored backs are almost impossible to see, in fact they are so clear they are extremely difficult to see if they drop on the floor. Perhaps the white colored are better. Also, these are so small that it is difficult for older person with arthritis or dexterity challenged to use. These are smaller than the ones available in Claire stores."
2,"Tiny, Tiny, Tiny","These backs as so tiny they're difficult to handle and even more difficult to put on an earring. Even without the earring being in my ear, the hole is so small, they wouldn't slide on many of the posts. Then try putting one on an earring when it's in your ear and you can't see what you're doing! I've used similar white, soft backings (which I prefer to the clear hard onesEarring Backs Safety Backs For Fish Hook Earrings Medium (144)), but these are too small to be practical."
4,Rubber backs for very thin earrings,I bought this specifically because of a bad review that said that the hole was too small. I've been searching for an earring back for a very thin fish hook earring and this is it. The only thing I would change about it is the color. I would prefer clear but the white is ok.
5,Easy to use,"I love these backings as they are flexible and easy to use. I wouldn't use any other. Shipping was right on time, too! Thanks, Amazon!"
5,Excellent buy,I have some trouble with fine motor skills and haven't been able to use the hard plastic backs at all. I had used the soft rubber backs befor but couldn't find locally. This arrived rapidly and shipping was free. Now I am no longer losing my fish hook earrings.
4,Mountain Woods Salad Bowl Set,I was very satisfied with the quality of the set and recently gave it to my niece as a gift. Those attending the bridal shower loved it as well as my niece.
2,Three months?,"At the risk of piling up the ""unhelpfuls,"" I'd just like to question the warranty on this machine (and, to be fair, some other portable DVD players). What does it say about the manufacturer's confidence in a $350+ product when both parts and labor are only warranted for 90 days? OK, so I guess in today's electronics marketplace, you pay your money and you take your chances, but at least 90 days/1 year doesn't seem unreasonable at this level."
4,Resource for daily use,The author gives practical tips for daily life which can be applied as needed by women. Her personal antidotes give credibilitiy to the concepts and ideas expressed. This book does help by giving ways to deal with real life issues. A good resource to be used by groups for discussion of these concerns.
4,Putting the rain of life behind...,"Most of us worry about some things - maybe many things. I tend towards believing that everything will work out just fine, especially the little details of life. So when I began reading this book, I wasn't sure it was going to provide what I thought I needed. I did find it very helpful as I discovered many areas that I do worry about, and I learned new ways to trust the Lord for the little things and the big things. Then - when I got to Chapter 8, I was punched in the heart. Chapter 8 is entitled ""Rain Behind You - How the Past Can Cloud the Present."" I found this chapter extremely helpful. It challenged me to complete the forgiveness process on old wounds, and to live today with healing and joy. I do not want to be held captive to the past, holding onto resentments, and punishing others for the circumstances that are long over. The book was helpful in getting me to this point. If you are a worrier, you need this book!"
3,replacement wires,"These wires work, but the fit wasn't so great. It was hard to be sure they were fully seated in the coil pack. The locking clips at the base didn't grip securely."
5,Note from author,"I am the author of PRACTICAL CONIC SECTIONS. This is not a review, but I am looking for advice for the publication of a companion book PRACTICAL GEOMETRIC SOLIDS. The company that published the first book (Conic) was sold and the new owner does not wish to publish the second book. Could you recommend a publisher or literary agent who would possibly handle it? It is approximately the same length and style as the first book. The two books could easily be combined into one volume. Both books contain information that is not found in any other books on their subjects."
3,Very mediocre...Roxette is better,"I like the songs by Per Gessle on the roxette albums, but this album is really just so-so. Of the 13 songs, i only thought 6 where worth listening to again. Im a roxette fan, but cant imagine people giving this cd 5 stars. No way."
4,Simular to 'Room Service' - Roxette,"All the songs could deffinately be passed off as Roxette, I don't know that an are particular standouts, but all verry good. Mostly the very up-beat songs he's famouse for with Roxette, not many Ballads. Even though Marrie Fredrickson does not appear in this album (except one song) there is unmistakebly a woman singer in some of these songs which makes it very identical to Roxete. I think this album is very simular to the new CD 'Roomservice' by Roxette. but not nearly as good as Roxettes previous album 'Have a nice Day' (2nd best album ever made in my oppinion)"
4,absolute pop genious,hey there us fans if ulike the heavier sound of roxette tunes like sleeping in my car buy this album. per gessle <<he used to have black hair>> hit's the air waves with a blast of power chords and brilliant ballads. goofy song titles aside <<elvis in germany...>> per creates ground breaking work on this underrated album.....look out for roxette in the fall in the US!
4,"Actually, 4.5 out of 5.","I could never give a 5 to any CD of the world. It's unfair. Or it isn't? That's not important now. The World According... is a refresh, a drop of Roxettism, of swedism, of that European air you wanna breed if you really appreciated the growing and development of pop from 80 - 90's. That's for non-Roxers fans. For those who are...comes the question: Where and why in time did Per forget to keep in this rocky way? Do you wanna be my baby? is definetely a summer hit, perfectly suitable with a Roxette album. Did Per simply forget how to do it or is Roxette the other side of the wall? I mean, if he can do such an excellent, powerful and happy songs album, why couldn't he keep it in Roxette ones?Anyway, if you wanna hear something good, something really worth and powerful in the last five years, don't think - buy it. You will feel many references to McCartney and Bowie styles. And of course, if nice strings please you more than keyboards and CPUs why didn't you order it yet???"
2,roughest book I have gotten from Amazon,It was described as nice and if it's nice I'd like to see a rough one.
4,"Brain Candy, Still Laughing","This guy has definitely done some late-night thinking with a fine sense of humor about life, philosophy, science, and human nature. Expect to laugh out loud repeatedly, and think into the night about some of life's most persistent questions. Great, fun read!"
5,So happy i found one,"I bought this knife for my boyfriend a few years ago and because he misused it, he broke the tip off. However, the wood handle is gorgeous and the blade is sharp. I didnt hesitate to order another one."
1,Broderbund World Atlas Support,"I recently purchased a new copy of Broderbund 3D World Atlas and it will not install on my computer. When I tried to reinstall a previous verson of the same software it would not longer run. I now find that Broderbund does not offer technical support for this product. I really liked the first version when it was running, but I strongly suggest that you do not buy 3D World Atlas from Broderbund now!"
4,the simplest nuts-and-bolts book anywhere,"This book takes you from step one (sizing up the project) through wiring, plumbing, stairs, walls, skylights, ceilings and sub-floors.My only regret is that it tells you nothing about how to choose and put down a finished floor. But having just turned my attic into a living space, I can say with authority that it is an excellent resource, especially if you're the general contractor for the job."
2,Fiction or Molly Myth?,"This book falls within the field of Pennsylvania coal mining and labor history. The author starts off with the standard notice that the story and characters are fictitious and any similarity to actual persons or events is purely coincidental. Then he proceeds to tell a story in which 90 percent of the people are actual historical figures who were involved in the Molly Maguire saga, using their real names. The story is strongly slanted in favor of the 'Mollies Were Victims' point of view and the courtroom aspects of the story bear little relationship to reality. The main character decides to join the Molly Maguires because his family is victimized by anti-irish prejudice, and his son gets framed for a murder he did not commit by none other than -- surprise! -- nefarious Pinkerton agent James McParlan. One yearns for a more original plot, better character development and greater realism. Otherwise it's a readable effort."
3,Hidden Greatness,"This early work by Kricfalusi and team has a lot of hidden gems. While the first season started slowly attempting to just match the spirit of the original series, it slowly drifts off the track and dives into the craziness we have come to expect from this group of artists. Catch the episodes with commentary on disks 1 & 2 and any episode with Bat-Bat. Disk 3 is all the gold. I can only surmise that they expected cancellation in season 2 and had whatever fun was possible!"
4,I loved this show,"This came on just before PeeWee's playhouse and made the dynamic duo of comedic Saturday morning cartoons. Sure they were both a bit hit and miss, but sometimes it was comedy magic. Truely extreamly hillarious. I've been looking for it ever since. It might dissapoint me when I see it again. But probably not since it was so unlike anything that existed before and since."
2,Written for children,"Robert Clouse was certainly trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator when he wrote this piece of garbage. What a shame that such an important story should be given such a hack job.It is valuable for the behind the scenes information and the great photographs. It is a story that needed to be told. It is valuable as a history, but nearly every sentence that Clouse penned is an insult to your intelligence.I do recommend buying this book, however. Hopefully one day, Mr. Clouse will write the same story, except for grownups, and this sloppy, rushed, middle school kid version will be forgotten."
4,The thoughts of Bruce and the frustrations of Hollywood,"Bruce Lee fans or cinematic enthusiasts will find this book interesting. There is not much depth of the insight into Bruce, however, when Robert Clouse provides it, it's quite revealing. Examples include Bruce's method of developing his concentration skills and how he practiced for a possible fight against Mohammed Ali.Most of the book is about the hurdles Clouse overcame producing the movie. Considering the obstacles he had, which included the budget, lighting, props, gang fights, and challenges toward Bruce, etc., he and Bruce did a remarkable job. The book is full of photographs, however there aren't any great pictures of Bruce that you probably haven't already seen.Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed."
3,Two giants a little lacking,"Two of the best jazz musicians who ever lived, but a little dissapointing. They compliment each other well, but I missed the base & drums which usually accompany them."
1,Why Didn't you call?I heard your singing on this song,"""Why didn't you call""is worse than ""I Try."" I'm sure Macy's a great songwriter,but that voice,its not on key,and sounds so much like Donald Duck.I know why he didn't call."
1,Not impressed,"This slipper is not what it appears in photo or product description. It looks like arch support by the curve of the cork - that is on outside only! Inside is FLAT! The ""genuine sheepskin"" lining is very thin, very sparse; Had to check description to make sure that they really said the word ""genuine"". Also NOT true to size as described; I am a 7.5, ordered an 8 and is way to small.Also check return policy that you have to contact store about - 8% restocking fee!! OUCH!!"
3,Inexpensive but decent.,"Definitely not the best but worth the price. Application leaves something to be desired. It seems to catch the hairs well enough. Product arrived promptly and as advertised. I have no complaints, really."
5,"Xcellent,","This product is excellent, my husband used it 20 years ago for his bass playing and now our 11 year uses it for her bass playing"
5,good rosin,One of the best rosins I have used. Get wonderful tone without being to crunchy or rough. The only thing it to make sure you work into the bow a little.
3,Great movie with a different title,"OK, I'm giving this 3 stars only because it is the same movie as ""Round and Round We Go."" It's frustrating to buy the same movie that you already have, only with a different name!!!!!!!! Wasted money."
3,George Washington Man and Myth,"This is a very small, concise review of George Washington's life, the Washington Monument and the events that have idolized him and made him into the Father of our nation. A very interesting read."
2,Rust!,"My wife and I made frequent and enthusiastic use of our kettle -- until she noticed a bit of rust at the tip of the spout. That made me look closer at the spout, at which time I saw that there was rust throughout."
2,"Pretty, but flawed.","This kettle has the wonderful, traditional Le Creuset whistle when the water comes to a boil. It has elegant styling and a durable vessel. What one would expect from such a respecable brand.It's got some serious flaws though. The handle extends beyond the edges of the kettle an so picks up quite a bit of heat from the burner underneath. It can be extremely hot if you don't take care to use a low flame.More serious though is that the lid is fitted so snuggly that one needs to place ones palm on the handle and grasp the lids knob with the fingers, then squeeze to make a fist in order to get enough leverage to pull the lid off. It was only after the knob finally broke off that I discovered that the threaded screw holding it on was less than 4 millimeters long.After 4 months of use, into the trash this kettle goes. I expected better from a brand like Le Creuset."
1,The whistle malfunctions...with disastrous results,"I've now owned two Creuset tea kettles and both times the whistle has failed and both times I burned up the pot (and ruined the stove top burner). Because I am an absent minded professor, I need to be WARNED or else I'm off in my own world. If you're like me and you absolutely need a reliable whistle on your tea kettle, then DO NOT purchase this brand. Oh, it's fine for a month or so, then the whistle starts to go and finally you'll end up burning down your neighborhood."
1,Pretty but dangerously flawed,"I picked this tea kettle because I couldn't find the one I wanted. It's pretty on the stovetop, but it's dangerously flawed:1) Boiling water surges unpredictably from the spout when pouring.2) The handle may fall over and melt.3) The whistle is not loud, and doesn't reliably sound."
1,ZERO STARS!,"This kettle is not worth one tenth of its price. The whistle hasn't worked since its second or third use, the knob broke off after a few months, and as I was about to throw it away, I noticed the blue and white enamel on the inside of the kettle, where the spout meets the body, was chipped and rusted. Who knows how long it had been that way, despite my carefully opening it and drying it out after each use. My family loves Le Creuset and we have many of their pots and accessories, and none has disappointed as much as this tea kettle."
1,poor design,"This kettle takes a long time to boil water, but the main problem is the handle--it doesn't stay upright, and as another reviewer noted, it heats up quite a bit, meaning you need an oven mitt or towel to hold it."
4,Nice little tea pot,Great little tea pot. Looks nice enough to leave on the stove between uses. Whistle is great so you don't forget and leave the pot on until it boils dry...
2,Flawed design results in little usable space,"The spout for the teapot needs to be mounted higher, but that would compromise design, apparently. This results in water spurting out of the spout rather than steam. In turn, this means you can fill the pot to about 1/2 of the total volume. If you are making tea for more than two or wish to make enough to have several cups, look elsewhere. Expensive for a teapot that will produce two cups per pot.My first unpleasant experience with the brand ever. We own over a thousand dollars in Le Creuset gear but this is their only failure."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!,"I'm a big fan of Le Creuset and I did my best to love this kettle. Unfortunately, the only positive thing I can say about it is that it looks stylish on my stove top. The handle sucks, the lid sucks,the whistle sucks and on top of that it gets rusted all over. It should be discontinued! Shame on Le Creuset for this product!!!"
1,Unreliable Whistle! Fire Hazard!,"I owned two of these kettles. Right out of the box the whistle was not reliable. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn't. That is fine, I thought, as long as you live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment and are always close enough to hear the water boil if the whistle fails. But then I moved to a bigger place and I have burned two of these kettles since.Why would you bother buying a tea kettle without a reliable whistle? You might as well just save the money and wait in the kitchen while you boil water in a regular pot.Don't buy this product! This Le Creuset kettle is a fire hazard and should be taken off the market. Even you might forget to remember one day that you had some water boiling for tea, and before you know it your apartment goes up in flames."
2,Expected Better,"I bought this kettle for my girlfriend 3 years ago and it has been in regular use since. Although I will say the build quality is good, the design is very poor. The main feature that needs to be resolved is that if you fill this kettle up to 1/2 full it will not whistle. Also the metal bracket handles get very hot. I think Le Creuset needs to go back to the drawing board with this one."
3,pretty,I love the look of this tea pot. It looks so charming in my kitchen and I use it daily. It has held up extremely well. My only complaint is the lid. It is very hard to get off and put back on. Other than that--it's spiffy!
4,Lives up to its title.,"Before you rush to order this a little hint: the title is ""Famous T&A;"" and that's what you get. If you're looking for a great story, look somewhere else because there's no story here. If you want great acting, try a different video.However, if you just want to see actresses you may have seen on TV doing nude scenes from earlier in their careers, or beautiful actresses you haven't heard of doing nudity for the camera, or notoriously nude actresses showing their stuff, this is a video you'll enjoy.Phyllis Davis, Ornella Muti, Ursula Andress, Brigette Bardot, Jaqueline Bisset, Uschi Digard, Joan Prather, Laurie Walters, Edy Williams. . .You know, Famous T&A;."
1,SYBIL DANNING'S MOST EMBARRASSING VIDEO!!!,"By far the worst video of Sybil Danning's released in the U.S.A. Even she admitted to it in an interview. She claimed she did it for the money. Essentially you get to see Sybil briefly naked as she put on a Warrior Outfit and waves a sword. She then reads cue cards describing what ""nude scene"" will appear featuring different film clips of actresses like Claudia Cardinale, and Ursula Andress in various states of undress. It is a horrendous video and not worth watching. I'm embarrassed for watching it. I'm a huge Sybil Danning fan, but I will never watch this awful video again. To sum it up, the video stinks!"
4,If you have a dog,This covers all the things you need to help you to succeed in training your dog to behave acceptably in public.
5,great,I'm enjoying this book alot. It also has pictures of dogs so that you can actually see what the writer means.
4,Very nice for beginners,"I got a sheltie puppy a few months ago, and even before that, I started reading as many books as I could about breeds, raising and dog behavior. I got this book after reading Cesar Millan's books, who recommends this book a lot. When you read it, you can notice its influence in Cesar's way. It's written in a easy-to-understand language, but not simplistic. Fogle uses a lot of references for everything he says, in addition to his own conclusions and personal experiences. Very nice book for those who are still experiencing the difficulties of their first dog, and for those who already are experienced but want to understand him better. For me, only negative point is black-and-white, with drawings instead of pictures, and a publishing date of 1992, making it hard to find his references. But still a book which proves its value when you see in practice what you've read."
5,Great behavior guide,"This is NOT a training manual, this is a dog behavior manual. It teaches you how to read and understand your dogs behavior and why he does the things he does. This is very understandable and enjoyable to read. Bruce Fogle gives lots of in depth information on genetics and how early learning can effect your dog. This is very scientific, and not necessarily an ""easy"" read. Some of the information can take a while to digest. This isn't a book you can read in two evenings. Bruce Fogle is very articulate and well read, and knows what he is talking about.I recommend this book to anyone who owns a dog, whether or not the plan on professionally training them or not. It has new information for even some of the most knowledgable people."
5,A Must For All Dog Lovers,"This book is extremely well-written and informative. It is an easy read for dog professionals and even for a lay-person. Extremely interesting and easy to understand. It covers the many reasons for why dog's behave the way they do, including, their evolution and neonatal development. If you want to understand your dog, this is the book to get."
1,No!,"There are numerous other books out there if you want to learn how to communicate better with dogs better. Better authors are Terry Ryan, Patricia McConnnell, Pamela Reid, Karen Pryor, Nicholas Dodman, Ian Dunbar, Suzanne Clothier, Stanley Coren, Randy Grim, Jean Donaldson and many others."
4,Nice book,"Nice book , not always easy to read and follow.I lost interest in the last few pages but over all a good book."
2,No New 'Insights' Here,"If you've never have had a dog, or never have read any books about dogs, this book may offer some 'insights' into dog behaviour. However, if you have cared for dogs before, you will most likely find nothing new in this book that observation and experience have not already taught you. The few obvious 'insights' the author makes are repeated time and time again, chapter after chapter, in this book."
4,Good overall book! A worthy addition to your library.,"This book gives a detailed description on the dog's mind. Some terms and anatomical references are however too scientifically detailed for the average reader with no clinical background. Overall however, the book does explain well how the dog's mind works. It is again, a worthy addition to your library."
2,Poor excuse for a 'scientific' read,"I was disappointed by this book after expecting a scientifically informative read. You have to sift through simplified and generic biology to learn anything about dogs in particular, and there are errors strewn throughout (such as the outdated idea that dogs see in black and white). If you're interested in actual research on dog behavior, skip this one and go straight to the literature."
5,Cool & Intriguing,"This book is excellent material that enables us to understand dogs better. I learned numerous things of the dog's psychological state i was unaware of. Not only does it explain the dog's mind, but it also gives training advice, which is totally effective.I fully and completely recommend this book to everyone i've met."
2,ok for new dog owners!!!,"This book proves a very interesting read. It allows you to find meanings for your dogs behaviour. However, most of the behaviour that is explained in the book is only from the authors point of view. Therefore, this book is very helpful to the new owner of a dog but is not so helpful to those studying in the area of animal behaviour. It provides no other theories from other animal behaviourists and is not useful for research purposes."
3,Useful,I agree with much of the theoretical information presented. It is just that too much of the book is only sentimental fill.
1,useless,"This book just says the same things that all other dog books say. Maybe if you don't have ANY dog books and you have a dog, it would be good to read SOMETHING about them. But otherwise, this book doesn't give any new insights. The little DVM after his name does not mean that this book is full of exciting new scientific delvings into the way that a dog's mind works. it's more like: after living with dogs for thousands of years, what are the most obvious things that any joe blow off the street can tell us about them? Maybe I've just read too many dog books."
3,A dogs Mind,"I found the book interesting to a degree; however, it was not what I was looking for and therefore did not meet my needs."
3,"Technical, informative but, somewhat, dated","Some very informative and interesting facts were presented, however, the book was more ""technical"" than I was anticipating. Also, most of the studies quoted were from decades ago. This book was originally published in 1990 and further studies, testing and trials have produced much more up-to-date information over the last twenty years for the dog lover/enthusiast. It was a decent read but definitely not at the top of my ""must reads"" concerning dogs, their thinking and their behavior."
4,"good information, but nothing new","I expected this book to be a little outdated because of its age, and it was. many of the ideas he states have since been proven wrong, such as the fact that all dogs see only in black and white. He did have some good information and thoughts on dog behavior and way of thinking, which is why I gave the book four stars. This book would be better for someone who doesn't know much about dog behavior--and I would recommend skipping the chapter on the biology of the dog's brain. I learned a few interesting tidbits, but after working with dogs for several years now and studying them extensively, I found this book contained little I did not know. Recommended for beginning and intermediate dog handlers and owners, this book has the basics and a little more, but I would not consider it an exhaustive reference on dog behavior."
3,A good place to start,"Dr. Fogle's treatise on the Dogs Mind is quite complete if not overly detailed.Part I, The Anatomy and Psysiology of the Dogs Mind, is suitable for the professional behaviorist or veternarian care giver,or breeder, but unnecessarily involved for the casual dog owner who wants to know why my dog does what she does. While interesting, I could have done without it, as a new-to the- game dog owner.Part ll however, gets to the meat of the matter with simplicity and completeness , dealing with learning and behaviour issues which is my area of interest. I would have liked to have seen an alphabetized index for ready reference. The Appendix, dealing with training is very helpful and concise.All in all I found the book useful, informative and written with humor and insight, but ultimately,not indispensible in my Library of dog books"
5,blues for you,"mannish boys, always pumping out the blues. this edition of the mannish boys has kid ramos on guitar. you know right there that you are going to get some sweet sounds. live is good."
1,poor production,"Old news...old local cable access shows from more than a decade ago, copied onto DVD. Production values low. Information very old. Unless you are completely ignorant on the subject, I would forget it...save your money."
4,Pretty good,"All of the tracks on this disc are really good. ""Pop Muzik"" and ""Numb"" are probably the best tracks on the cd, and"" Happiness is a warm gun"" is pretty good too. If it was just those, I'd give it 5 stars. ""Last Night On Earth"" is only ok. They should have named it something else because there is nothing from the original ""Last Night On Earth"" at all. It doesn't have any lyrics whatsoever! Just a lot of music. The only thing that I can see that the song is good for is dancing. The music on the track is still ok. Like I said, the other songs are great, ""Last Night On Earth"" kind of ruins it. I still think it's worth buying however, if they dropped the price just a little bit."
4,Very good,Good piece of history. Wish there were more than 98 minutes to the video. Very educational and poignant. Everyone interested in baseball should watch it.
2,(No)-Hit-and-Miss Collection,"Two things you need to know before ordering this disc:- Most tracks were taken from acetates and the sound quality is very dicey;- There is a reason you've never heard any of these songs.That having been said, there are a few amusing tracks but most are lackluster 1968 ""product"". This is for devoted fans of soft Brit psych-pop. Wait for a used copy under $12 to pop up and you'll probably feel that you've gotten your money's worth."
5,Just as good as her other wonderful CDs,I have all of Annie's solo works - This one needs at least one review here! - It's definitely as good as her others - such heartfelt worship in her unique style - really able to touch one who seeks sweet worship of their Savior.
1,Nothing new,"I was disappointed that this book didn't have any enlightening information or advice about online dating. There really were no ""secrets"" revealed as the title suggests. Anyone who has ever been on an online dating site could write the very basic information presented."
4,These save my furniture,"I got a couple of these thin boxes because the double-wide boxes weren't carried by Amazon anymore and these were part of the 4 for 3 promotion with free shipping. My cats love these scratchy boxes! However, this particular box is too thin. I recommend buying the double-wide over this one unless you have kittens. They are very messy too so be forewarned. However, I would rather have tiny bits of cardboard on the floor than have shredded furniture. The kitty hoots boxes also come with catnip that my kitties love."
4,"The depths of insanity, no LSD necessary to realize them","Men's Recovery Project's music is totally insane and off the wall, the same way music like the Residents or Captain Beefheart was in the late 60s and early 70s... but Men's Recovery Project are no hippies. A bunch of ex-punks ""lose the battle against insanity"" and here's the outcome. lyrically... amazing.... musically... plain rad. people in my high school journalism class freaked out when i played this CD... ha! Too many classics on this to not own it... i already had 80% of this on vinyl...but it's too good!"
4,Good basic camera,We have had this a while. It has survived several drops to the floor and two small kids pushing buttons over and over. The outside is scratched up but it still works. Decent quality photos. We will probably upgrade to something with more pixels next time. Great little camera.
2,NO VIEWFINDER,"I purchased the camera ..but i ended up returning the camera...I had no idea it had no view finder....I thought all camera""s had a view finder... I will look at the item description closer from now on...because i ordered it, I have to pay return postage..."
5,Really nice camera at a nice price,"I went all over town looking for a good digital camera that wasn't too expensive. I had previously owned a fuji film camera and it just wasn't getting the job done. I went to store after store asking different salespeople what was the best brand, best value, etc. Almost all of them pointed out an Olympus Camera, and I finally settled on the fe115. I like products that I can just use right away and not read the instructions for a half hour before I use them. This little guy fits the bill and then some. Absolutely great picture quality, and the image stabilization is really nice. Easy to use camera with great features and affordable (although I paid more at another store...always check amazon first!) I give it an A+!"
5,Fantastic Camera,"I just received this camera a few days ago and i'm very thrilled. I actually took a few try out pictures in my dark living room and to my surprise the pictures were amazing. Nice, small and compact. The ease of use is surprising. Great Camera."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"This was the best $50 that I spent to get my practice started. I was an employee at a large group for 5 years, but I had no idea where to start for certain licenses and regulations. The chapter ""Managing Personnel"" was especially helpful. This book is concise and clearly written. It has excellent resources listed, such as helpful websites. This book would be helpful to someone just finishing residency and someone who has been an employee of a group for several years. JMMD"
4,Get back to your roots!,"While this book may not have some of the later, bigger hits by the band, it contains some of their early classics that truly began to define them as a super funk machine. Hello, ""Funky Worm,"" anybody? True, they were with a ""small"" label when they started out, but that label, Westbound Records, discovered uh I don't know some of the biggest funk bands ever -- Funkadelic, Parliament, George Clinton, Melvin Sparks, and Caeser Frazier. I don't know, but I'm glad I bought this book. It's been easy to use and my band has pulled together some great covers of some of these songs by using it! Highly recommended."
2,no good,"I've been trying to sell this CD for 3 years. Every year I go back and try to listen to it again. The songs are not structured well. It's a slow-going CD. I fall asleep halfway thru each song. It's a real bummer because I love female singers and all-female bands even more. I wouldn't suggest buying this CD. Sorry, but it's a dissapointment."
5,Buckley Wins Again!,"If you are looking for a complete ""how to"" on lean manufacturing, this is a must have for your library. Clearly drawing on years of experience in implementing lean manufacturing systems, Mr. Buckley has compiled in one neat volume all of the essential pieces necessary for a successful implementation. Each chapter follows a similar format opening with an introduction to the concept, followed by theory and real life examples, with a nice summary to conclude the topic. In addition to covering all the pieces of the lean manufacturing pie, Mr. Buckley closes with a key ingredient often missing from manufacturing treatises - how to use teams for successful implementation. A great read on winning in manufacturing by someone who has obviously been there and done that."
5,Winning in a Highly Competitive Manufacturing Environment,"Many books explain how a Just-In-Time factory operates, but few offer simple, straightforward guidelines on how to accomplish the conversion -- and even in a high mix, low volume environment. The author calls on good practical examples, and provides personal experiences of what is required to make the change. It even goes one step further in explaining what barriers you will encounter during the transition. If you are looking to reduce your operating costs and convert your manufacturing operation to JIT, this book is a MUST read."
3,Well what can you really expect?,"The Magin of Krynn is a compilation of short stories 10-40 pages long by variouse ameteur authers that help develope the Dragonlance universe. As the title suggests, the common theme throughout the book is the use of magic for good or evil yet each story is unique it's own way. In my opinion, The Magic of Krynn is truly an *ameteur* work. The writing is second rate and the styles just don't compare to that of Marget Weis and Tracy Hickman. Yet these writers have great immaginations and really have some nice imput into the fantasy genre. The Magic of Krynn is a good book to have around the house when you just need a quick shot of Dragonlance action, but for the seriouse fantasy reader, it is nothing great at all."
4,Great!,Well most of the stories were good but some were boring.... Anyways there were some great ones like the legacy which is a novella. If you just want to read the best stories out of all the tales then you should buy the book the best of the tales.
3,cute,"This is a very cute book.It's more Danish-American than Danish, though, so if you're looking for a book about Denmark, this is not the one.That said, it's nice, in its own way. Sweet, charming, full of stories of Midwestern grandmothers and such, as well as stories about Danish-American enclaves in the USA. There are some nice recipes, pretty much all of which are duplicated in the book ""Dear Danish Recipes.""I was hoping for more insight into Denmark, but this is really more of a Danish-American immigrant thing. Good for what it is, and there's nothing wrong with that."
5,A practical and much needed guide for women,"A gripping read, it is hard to tear away from a book that helps women regain trust in our own intuitive bodies for the first time in over 700 years. Both the author and her writing are grounded in scientific search and spiritually rooted. In addition, a poetic rendering of practical exercises of a psychological, physical, and spiritual nature is a pleasure to read and easy to carry out. For women who are skeptical about the wisdom of our bodies (as we have been trained to be since childhood), this book is an easy read. I heartily recommend it to women and the men who want to understand us."
1,Ridiculous,"I have to say, this is the most ridiculous book I have wasted money on, in a very long time."
4,Way better than the groups they get lumped in with.,"Unlike the Backstreet Boys or N Sync, these guys actually wrote their own stuff and could play their own instruments. I give them all the credit for being more talented than the ""boy bands"" that came out at around the same time."
1,All fight and no substance,"My brother, the late Joe Stewardson, was supposed to be in this movie. His name was on the cover, but having watched the whole movie and carefully scrutinizing the credits, he is not in this movie. Having watched the movie, I am happy that he is not."
5,At last somenthing that makes sense!,"With this new book the author has given to Isshinryu a new and more advance approach. The techniques in the book are not based on the traditional ""block, punch and kick"". Instead of describing the bunkai as ""everything is pressure points"", the author analyze the techniques from the perspective of locks, Chin Na, White Crane, Kuiai Jiao and others. The author also give another surprising theory about the Isshinryu patch, presenting proof of its origins. The book is a must for the advance Isshinryu martial art."
5,Great Analog Booklet...Electronic ISBN-13 Listing Hell...,"Great instructional Karate Bunkai booklet but please be aware that for some reason its ISBN-13 number is shared with """"A Friend of the Earth"" so your chances of getting a copy of a Karate Instructional Booklet is nil...I am 0 for 10 with Amazon Booksellers trying to purchase another copy so I give up and I'll just keep referring to my old dog-eared edition. Now I have 3 unwanted copies of """"A Friend of the Earth"" to get rid of... What a MESS... Amazon.com has been LESS than helpful."
1,bAD FOR YOUR DEVELOPMENT!,fAR & bEYOND FROM THE REAL CHINNA & THE oKINAWAN WAY! mmmmmmmmmmm! no good! sorry!!!
3,"Technically sound, but editorially not honest","As a biologist currently employed as Group Product Manager in a leading pharma/biotech company (top 5 worldwide), I'm interested in progressive developments of nanotechnology applications to medicine.As such, I purchased both volumes of Nanomedicine of R. Freitas.The second volume presents itself as a tiny book, whose size could have easily been included in the volume 1. Since I paid each book $ 99, I ask myself whether it was so impossible making it of only one volume.Deception grows when opening the book.Half of it is a list of all references cited in the text.Roughly 150 out of 330 pages are what effectively is involved in Nanomedicine biocompatibility.Fortunately, the 150 pages left are worthwhile and interesting (and this deserves the 3 stars), but editorial politics is really upsetting."
4,"Good introductory Unix text, even if it is outdated.","This is a good book for people who are totally new to Unix. It is pretty outdated, but most of the Unix concepts are ""timeless"" and still valid. The book starts off assuming you know nothing about Unix and runs through all the basics. It is well written and easy to understand. I believe it is out of print now, I was only able to read it because someone in the office had a copy laying around and I borrowed it. Good introductory text and starting point before you read more in-depth books."
1,Not Satisfied,"This product was very eye catching and contemporary, but when I received it it didn't fit my laptop. My notebook is 14"", so I bought a size medium. It appears as if the Built NY company didn't take into consideration that most laptops are not built in an hour glass shape like they made their sleeves. My computer would have fit length-wise, but it was impossible to get it through because the way the sleeve curves. You'd think they would have caught this and adjusted their sizes accordingly..."
3,Doesn't fit an IBM T60,"Despite being told by Built NY that this size sleeve should fit my T60, it was too narrow. While I could have exchanged it for the next size up, I didn't because then it would have been way too long.I suspect if it fits your notebook computer that it'd be great."
4,Now my Vaio is safe,"I bought this for my new white sony vaio. the sleeve (pattern: stripe) appears brighter in tone in the picture but it still looks good. Fits the 15 inch laptop perfectly. arrived via UPS on time. for a bit under $15, it was just what I needed. In stores, you cannot get a built sleeve for this price unless you had/have the patience to get a door buster deal on black friday - which I am not keen to do."
3,A bit misleading in size,"I have a BenQ joybook with a 15.4"" screen and have had to push pull and squeeze to get into into this sleeve, but i can zip it up (just). The redeming features are the colour, seemingly heavy duty zipper and the neoprene (wetsuit) fabric. Next time would think twice and probably buy the 17"" Sleeve (even if it is to big)."
1,"Too small for a 15.4"" laptop","I bought this sleeve to fit my Dell 15.4"" laptop - well it was like trying to fit into size 6 pants when you should wear a 14. It also has the chemical-y smell of the neoprene. yuck."
3,just different,"I ordered this item some two months ago.Even if the long shipping time can be due to italian customs, nevertheless the laptop sleeve I received was different in colors and printed pattern from the one I saw online.It came also with no tags and a bit wrinkled since it was put in a simple paper envelop.All in all, disappointing, even though it's not a remark about the quality of the product."
4,Excellent book for ambivalent doctorate applicants,"This book definately contains a great overview of the whole process and feel for what a doctorate degree involves and demands. It also includes a good deal of information on the setbacks that women in doctorate programs may encounter to prepare them for a doctorate program. Still, this book is definately not worth $65.00. (Hint, Hint)"
1,PAINFUL!,"I was hoping to find something to last longer than a day to keep some single lashes on, so I tried this, OMFG! It was like cement! I accidently got one stuff to my eyelid and it took a half hour to get it off, plus it feels heavy on your lashes.I'll just stick to the paste, thank you!^..^"
4,"Great book, but needs photos!!!","Muy buen libro, lleno de buenas recetas caseras, bien explicadas, aun las que no son tan frecuentes, muchas reseñas a reuniones familiares y con amigos.En resumen, buenas recetas, bien detalladas, lamento mucho que en todo el libro no haya ni una solo fotografia.Buena compra para los que quieren tener muchos menus para elegir."
1,chaotic,"This recipe book was a gift and I am from the UK so I was excited to make some good british recipes but the format is so erratic and all over the place that it is hard to read. Maybe I am just used to Delia's books where if you are looking for an appetizer, you look under appetizer and voila but it takes ages to find what you are looking for. I would forgive that if the recipes turned out as described but I have made the fudge surprise cake twice now and followed the recipe to the tee and they were both a watery disaster, if you leave it in the oven for longer to dry it out, it comes out like cement and still has water floating on top. Dissapointing when you spend a small fortune to use valhrona and $$powdered cocoa."
2,Great Expectations,"As a devoted fan of Nigella Lawson, I had high hopes for this book. The chapters are laid out by menu, not by food category. Her desserts are great, but to be honest some of the main courses have been simply awful, like the South East Asian Mussels and the Beet greens with soba noodles. Plus there are no pictures in this book. How to be a Domestic Goddess is a more entertaining book."
3,"A good read, but not a great cookbook","This book is indeed a good read. I love Nigella's philosophy on eating and cooking and her excitement for both is clear throughout the anecdotes and conversation-like ""instructions."" You can get some good pointers in this book, if you're in search of some that is, on how to find pleasure in eating, cooking, and life in general. As to the actual cooking aspects, this book does give you a good start as to what to do about some of the basic stuff on cooking, such as making stock, sauces, roasting, freezing and storing foods, etc. But other than the basic stuff, the other recipes are just not very appealing, and some just sound wierd--not what you would really make for everyday home cooking. I like the book, and will keep it as a reference, though I doubt I will refer to it regularly."
5,Excellent eating!!,Nigella captures what the true essence of eating is all about. Not just the cooking and the recipes but the nature of food itself. Cooking from these recipes makes me appreciate so much more what goes into the preparation of the meal. I loved it!
2,disappointing,"I love Nigella's TV show, but was very disappointed in this book. The format is downright confusing and the recipe directions poor. The recipe for Barbados Cream says to mix all ingredients, but she doesn't really mean for you to mix in the brown sugar. Recipes tell you to ""beat til fairly stiff but not too stiff"" (whatever that means) with no time recommendations. She talks about simple, unpretentious food but includes some very odd ingredients and complicated directions. There seems to be more effort put into the glib tone of the writing than into the food."
5,i dig her cooking and her versatility,i truly enjoy the blends and stylings of what Nigella Lawson comes out with. her use of spices and flavoring. this Book offers so many treats and makes you enjoy your meals. i like the details and overview that this book has and the insights on various dishes. I also feel and think that Nigella Lawson is one of the Most Striking and Prettest Ladies on the Planet as well. that beauty and joy comes across in her cooking and her meals with her trademark humor.
4,Awesome - but not a picture book!,"This book is what I consider the ""Nigella Basics Training"" - lots of recipes included here are basics, staples and/or 'mainstays' of cooking.For those who only enjoy cookbooks that have lots of pictures, this book is not for you. I can go either way - the pictures are fun, but it's kind of like pictures of food at McDonalds - the 'real' end product often looks nothing like it, but tastes fine either way.That said, this book is filled with valuable recipes and bundles them together into full meals. If you're looking for a single recipe, the index has them all, but I really like that she makes recommendations for dishes that go well together and have gone over well in her own cooking experience.You'll likely find yourself reading the book leisurely, which is exactly the intent - take your time, enjoy the process, and have a great time in the kitchen!(If you must have pix - ""Nigella Bites"" and ""How to Be a Domestic Goddess"" have plenty!)"
3,Use common sense with the oven temps here!,"I just made the lamb shoulder (425 degrees for 30 mins per pound??) Needless to say, my kitchen was smoke filled after 15 mins and dinner was ruined. I live in the US, and wonder if there was a mistake in the metric translation. Browsing the other recipes, I discovered most of the oven temps seemed awfully high - especially for braising (400 degrees F)!Please use common sense and don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Books OnLine is better,"This is a terrible book, which only tells you very basic things, which anyone who clicks around Enterprise Manager for a while would know... It pads out the pages by showing output of long DBCC runs.. Each chapter describes what it's going to teach you, then proceeds to teach you nothing. Later it refers back to what you learned in previous chapters.. A complete joke."
5,Excellent piece,"Some would classify this work as a ""5"". That which reaches beyond the daily complications, and steps back to view the larger picture, assembling the details. Barry Grimes has done a superb job of detailing the passion of teaching and learning. Beautiful work!"
5,Best sardines on the market,These are the best sardines on the market - a great flavor of salsa combined with the also healthy sardines. Love them but can't find them locally lately...worried they may be discontinued. Hope not! No other brand has come up with as good a combination as far as I'm concerned.
4,Great buy!,"I agree completely with the first review; however, I would add that the shoes I received were a little small in size. I normally wear a US size 7 and I think I could have faired better with a 7.5. I bought these, as well as the black color, for work; by the end of my work day (standing for almost 7 hours), my feet are really tired."
2,More about commandos running and hiding than fighting,"This is the first person recount of an audacious commando raid to capture a German General on Crete during World War II. But most of the story is about trying to avoid German patrols. It isn't an exciting adventure, it's more like a story about a game of hide and seek than a war story or history.This book is highly focused on one operation without reference to anything else in the war. There's nothing telling if something significant was learned by debriefing the general. What we do learn about is the author's view of the residents of Crete (but we can't be sure whether it's accurate or prejudiced).It's reasonably well written but not engrossing."
4,You won't put it down once you start.,"This book is a really fun read. It's all a bit mysterious, but it tells a classic tale of the British upper class at war. It's kind of a cross between ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Guns of Navarone"", but with a lot less violence. Exactly what organization the author works for, and what context it all takes place in is lacking. But the chase across Crete and the author's insights into the locals kept me glued to my chair reading until I had read from front to back. See also the 1957 movie of the same name with Dirk Bogarde. For another book in the same vein find a copy of F.S. Chapman's ""The Jungle is Neutral"". Another WW2 ""way behind the lines"" story, this time in Malaya."
4,Great learning tool,The Scientific Interactive Planetarium is a great learning tool. My 3 1/2 year old was fascinated with the one at her daycare so I tried to find one similar. This was a great find for the price. She can tell me how many moons a certain planet has. This is something she will continue to use for the next few years.
3,planetrium,I bought this for my grandson but found it a little advanced for the age it was recommended for. He did eventually get to use it in his 3rd class when he was studying the solar system. It provides interesting facts about the solar system although the voice is a little difficult to understand. It is definitely more appropriate for ages 8+.
2,Stop working in a few months,"I love these lamps for their look but all of the four I've used (two black, one orange, and one blue) stop working forever when their bulbs burned out--that is withn a year. Replacing the burned-out bulbs has not helped. I'd surely appreciate it if someone could tell me why."
3,~*BSC #95*~,"I thought this book was well written, and I was pleased that finally Kristy has a serious love relationship. I have always found though that in reality by 8th grade, kids are much more experienced then what Ann portrays in the novels. If she is going to write about eighth graders, then if should be with material and content that has to do with eighth graders. Otherwise, I enjoyed the book. I thought it showed girls that they don't have to be pressured into a relationship if they're aren't ready, but most girls don't have the confidence that Kristy does to really go up to a boy that they have feelings for and tell him off the way she did. I also thought that the punishment that Kristy got was a little severe...the embaressment of getting ""caught in the act"" should have been punishment enough, but it was funny reading about all the ways Kristy tried to stay involved and keep sane."
5,Da bomb!,"Well, this book was like totally cool, and I mean it! It is really neat of how Kristy copes with everything. I can not belive that anyone would ever not like any book in The Baby-sitters Club series. They're all awsome!"
2,beware. not all tracks are good reproductions,"Have disk 2 . Red red wine is the UB40 version, not Neil's. Also, play me, soolamon, and some other tracks are versions that do not correspond with the recorded version's. Frankly, about half of the track's are usable."
2,Only Celine saved the show...,All the others were out of tune or without any inspiration. Aretha creams more than sings... The finale (all the divas) was horrible... Each one trying to sing louder than the others until ruin the song
3,The Genius SW-Flat 2.1 850 - Decent performance at the right price,"The Genius SW-Flat 2.1 850 is a 2.1 stereo speaker system that gives you decent performance at the right price.This was my first experience with Genius and I was pleasantly surprised. Granted, this is a set not aimed at the high performance end of the market. But the set delivers good performance at a nice price. For those that like the look of flat panel speakers, this is probably the best value you can get.The Subwoofer is a decent performer. The front has control knobs and ports for headphones and external devices. The back has the speaker hook-ups and power connector.At 20 Watts of power, this set will suffice for the middle of the market. Turn it all the way up and it will hiss and pop. More demanding users should look elsewhere. But if you need a 2.1 computer speaker set for an exta PC, this is a pretty good value."
3,A little bit tedious,"I don't know why but I found a little bit tedious when reading the book, maybe it is because sometimes it says too much ""theoretical"" words than those plain languages that is easy to understand."
3,kind of a pain!,"This device is just OK...like others who have it, it does prove to be easy to use when working out/running. Unfortunately, it will download songs onto the device that then do not play...you never know what format/song it will decide to play until you finish with all your downloading and turn it on...only to find that alas, half of the songs are listed but will not play. GRRR! Also, the FM radio is useless...sounds like crap and difficult to navigate (slow). I already bought another MP3 player to replace this although, the sound quality IS good on the Verge...what to do!"
2,"Poorly researched, at least one section...","Taking a slam at Anton LaVey on pg 318, the author seems to not even know what books the man has written. He attributes ""The Sorcerer's Handbook"" to LaVey, a book he's never written."
3,Basically not as good as Ghosts.,"I agree with everyone else in most of the comments. He describes everything in the book very vividly and you do feel like part of the story when reading it. It didn't catch my interest until about 150 pages in - it just wasn't as good as his other novel 'Ghosts' which i would recommend to everyone who thinks they might enjoy this book. Ghost was great from the beginning, and kept you interested all the way through - with a much better twisted ending."
3,"Good writing style, but slow","Granted, I do go for the novels with quick thrills and chills. I like action, things happening, sharp dialogue. None of these were present in this book. I liked ""Ghosts"" and was excited to read this book, but frankly, it disappointed me. I can handle a few ""close calls"" to keep one guessing, but over and over again? It frustrated me and I stopped reading it halfway through. Try ""Ghosts"" if you want a sharp, thought-provoking and chilling book!"
1,Utterly Silly,"I went into this book with high hopes, after reading the reviews the other readers gave it. What a huge disappointment I was in for. ALL of the characters were unbelievable, the plot was ridiculous, and the ending was so far out there I didn't know whether to laugh or throw the book across the room in disgust. I will never read another Noel Hynd book again. This was a waste of my money."
2,Christian Fiction ???,A poor example of Christian Fiction. I do not care to read the Lord's name used in vain especially by an author who has Zondervan as one of his publishers. I got Hynd's name from a list of christian authors. Koontz will serve you better. Dekker much better.
3,Ghosts was better,"Like Ghosts, this starts out okay, has some nice little chilling moments that'll have you wondering what-was-that-noise? in the middle of the night. But aslo like Ghosts, the ending is not very good. I think Hynd suffers from a problem that plagues a lot of writers: they don't know how to end their stories. BUT, I reapeat BUT, if you go into this as a mixture of fantasy and horror, it actually works on some level. It's has a fun pulse to it. No, it's not really horror, but i don't think it's all that bad either. My recomendation would be to read Ghosts first, it's much better and scarier. Then read this in the way you'd watch a comedy after watching a horror movie, a way to settle down."
4,For A Good Fright,"Noel Hynd turns up the fright level to full throttle in this novel. It is written so well it is like you can touch, taste, and smell the surroundings in the book. This is a quick read and recommended for anyone who wants to be transported out of reality and plopped directly into the world of a classic ghost thriller."
5,Outstanding!!!!!!!,"I am here to tell you that I have had this spice. I absolutely love this spice!! It is NOT hot, what it is , is exotic, savory and it makes everything I add it to, POP!!!!!!! WOW! If you like exotic flavors, get this!!"
2,I didn't want a sex book,I thought this would be a self help book about getting the love you deserve and/or accepting the fact that you deserve love. It is more geared towards getting the love you deserve in the bedroom.
4,one of their best single releases,"I agree with the last reviewer; this is essential for U2 fans who saw them on their Pop tour because of Pop Musik. The title track is also better than the album version. It's probably the one they intended to release but they were already in a rush to finish the album before the '97 tour. Happiness Is A Warm Gun is one of their best covers ever, with a Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill me vibe going on. I would have given this 5 stars, but apparently this one is missing the Numb remix, which isn't that great but I don't know why they wouldn't include it on this disc. The other 3 tracks are far better than Numb and it won't be missed that much."
3,better than part 2,"This is not the best U2 single available from the 'Pop' releases.""Last Night on Earth"" [Single Version]. Compared to the version on 'Pop', this single version has an abbreviated intro, added vocals in the middle section, and louder guitars in the chorus.""Pop Muzik"" [Pop Mart Mix]. The first 4:30 of the instrumental track were used in the opening sequence of the Pop Mart tour, but in this version, Bono ""sings"". However, the last 4:00 minutes have no purpose at all.""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" [The Gun Mix]. This is an interesting cover of the Beatles classic, originally recorded for an ill-fated TV show. However, for those who were not enthralled with some of the more overworked material on 'Pop', this will be a disappointment."
4,Last Night on Earth pt.1,"This single is a good buy for your money, nearly 30 minutes long. The Last Night on Earth track is a lengthy remix. Very different from the traditional U2 style, using electronic beats and rythms to create a dance mix. The entire CD is borderline of being techno. Mild U2 fans won't like it since it strays from earlier material. However, it is a good buy for fans who appreciate the more cutting edge material from Pop and Zooropa. Other tracks include a remix of Numb, accompanied by the Soul Assasins. The third track is a cover of the Beatles song, Happiness is a warm gun."
3,"Not bad, but there are better ones","This book is not bad at all, but ""Aircraft Maintenance and Repair (Glencoe Aviation Technology Series)"" is way better. The comparison does not seem appropriate, but it is. Both books provide introductory information on each relevant aircraft system, but while the one being reviewed here is hollow on theoretical information and rich in examples from transport-category aircraft, the other book mentioned here covers the same systems, but with much more theoretical and practical information."
1,Shameful Sham,"I was extremely disappointed with Mr. Moses' latest attempt (1995). Unlike ""The Drone"", which showed creativity and inspiration, this work has as much depth as instant coffee: the color is there, but no flavor."
2,This book is terrible!,"This book should be called ""Simple Thai & Chinese Cooking"" because all the recipes are thai or chinese. I didn't find any authentic laotion recipes. Examples of recipes they have: Fried Wonton, Skewed Chicken, Bok Choy and Tofu Soup, Vegetable Fried Rice, ORANGE PORK!!! No special recipes whatsoever. The only laotion recipies I saw were for Lob."
1,Eh...,"I'm sorry, but I don't see how a celebrity, especially one as admittedly pampered and spoiled as Jessica, could possibly relate to how us ""normal folk"" prepare a wedding. Based on her reality show, her parents do EVERYTHING, and I'm guessing that the same went on for her wedding. I found the tips I got from friends made more sense."
1,For Jessica Simpson fans only,"Funny how a book about a wedding only has HER on the cover, did she marry herself?? No thank-you...for those of you who want a GREAT wedding book, go to the EXPERT party coordinator - Martha Stewart. A beautiful and insightful wedding planning book as opposed to a celebrity's book of self-indulgence."
4,This is an sweet book from Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey.,I like this book from Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey because those two newlyweds were a sweet sensitive and a cute couple and it shows themselves that they loved each other very much and I watch their shows on MTV like every almost single weekdays and sometimes on the weekends when it's shows on the television it's great to have a cute couple married each other very happy and very romance too! I wish Jessica and Nick would never ever gonna go in argument ever again! so good luck to the both of you cute couples! I am very pleased and happy for you two cute couples!!
3,"Good book, but does she really deserve credit??","I like Jessica, respect her as an artist, but to put together a wedding book, just because you are well off, famous, and married?!? Give me a break, please. That would mean that most celebrities can write a book by asking professionals in the flower, dress, catering, planning business to write an excerpt and then viola! You have yourself a book. I like the pictures and think her wedding was gorgeous but why should Jessica receive royalties and credit when all she really did was make a couple of phone calls and contact a publishing company?"
1,Good for someone who didn't really write it,"All she really did was allo other people to write it and slapped her name on it. Its something you can find in any wedding book, its only popular because her name is on it. You honestly think she had the time to write a book?"
1,Just ... no,"I highly doubt that Jessie and Nick will even be married a year from now. So why buy this? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.As for the Jessica fans who think those of us who've criticized the book are ""jus jellus"" of her (yeah, right) and are rating her, rather than the book, well, how can you not? Her whole sham of a marriage is intertwined with her career, thanks to the reality show, so it's difficult to separate the two. And, yes, the book has some nice pics, but it's hard to feel inspired by someone who sold out on her marriage, and seems headed for a divorce.I WAS RIGHT AND YOU WERE WRONG! IWAS RIGHT AND YOU WERE WRONG! DID I CALL THEIR SPLIT OR WHAT? HA HA HA HA HA THIS BOOK REALLY IS A PUNCHLINE NOW, EH?"
2,"Nice book, not helpful to the bride.","This book is pretty, however, its basically Jessica's wedding album with a few notes. Good if you're a Simpson fan, not too helpful when planning a wedding, especially planning a wedding on a budget."
1,NEVER GOT IT!,"Don't buy ANYTHING from NOAH74! After several attempts to contact this seller, he finally responded. It has been a MONTH and still no book! I finally got my refund with a note that read ""Sorry, Noah"". What a crock!"
1,Ummmmmm....,"I wonder if she's going to ""write"" a second book called ""Jessica Simpson I Don't: Achieving Your Dream Divorce""."
1,Sad,"I actually feel sorry for Jessica. She reminds me of Jennifer Lopez in that she is always striving one way or another to get the attention of the public, regardless, of how it affects those around her. This book is another self indulgent compliment to her narcisstic self as the book cover confirms. Personally, I don't find her really that beautiful. I can't help feeling Nick felt ripped off marrying this doll of the media. Good luck to them both. What happens after the dream wedding is achieved? Will they both live happily ever after in their day-to-day regular life as a married couple? I guess we all know the answer."
2,Not worth it,"I only bought this book because I wanted to copy her hair style for my own wedding. I actually read through the entire book, and I didn't take any of her advice. I think I just had a different vision in mind of my own wedding and how I wanted things done, but I just don't believe that she was involved in the process as much as I was. She had a team of stylists, coordinators, planners, and assistants to make sure her day went off as planned. My suggestion - hire a coordinator, but find one that is reasonable. I did a lot of my own planning and new what I wanted and worked with the coordinator to make it happen. I interviewed photographers, caterer's, bakers, etc... I really used the coordinator very little prior to the wedding, but used him a ton at the rehearsal and the day of. Don't expect a book to do everything for you."
4,Beautiful.,Even though I should have thrown a few extra bucks the the dvd to be included the book is like my little pet (is that sad?) the pictures are beautiful and some of the advice is pretty good. Even though it has all ended for the two of them they were lucky to have such a beautiful wedding.
3,"Good, but cautious","This is a good book on current practice of methadone and other opioid agonist therapy, but it is very cautious about innovations in treatment (or a return to the more effective Dole-Nyswander model) like adequate dosing, use of other drugs and other therapuetic interventions. An excellent review of cost effectiveness."
5,Mastering Machine Applique: The Complete .....,"I believe Harriet Hargrave is a renown premier expert in the art of hand and machine-quilting. This book is packed with fabulous info and easily understood verbiage. This is a must-have book for anyone serious about doing machine applique. If that isn't more than enough reason to buy this book, the Tips and Hints and excellent photos are like having this teacher in the room answering my every question."
5,Powerful and compelling!,"This is a wonderful book! In ""Thin Through The Power Of Spirit"" Lucia Capodilupo shares her ideas of how to ""Create Paradise in Your Weight and World"". Instead of focusing on fat grams and calories etc. Lucia suggests we look to the Spirit within us all to find permanent weight loss. ""The first step to permanent weight loss begins in the soul"" according to Lucia. Lucia gives you mental exercises to do to become more aware of your spirituality. By doing so Lucia believes you can accomplish the type of body weight that is right for you. Exercises include learning to practise self forgiveness, to treat your body with love, to learn the art of gratitude etc. The techniques she shares are powerful and life changing. She also shares wonderful techniques to help resist temptation. I think the book is a wonderful guide to developing greater spirituality and creating the healthy life we desire."
5,Profound ...,"An anthropologist once told me that certain human beings are touched by the hand of God. Lucia Capodilupo is one of these creative, insightful, and profound authors. This book is not ""yet another"" trendy solution to excessive weight gain. Bypassing the quick fix, Lucia focuses on the trials of the human soul. Her writing is clear and her suggestions full of wisdom and promise."
4,Oil filters-competitively priced and delivered,"Being a maintenance buff for our families 4 vehicles, I find Amazon a convenient and very cost-effective source for my Fram Automotive products. Besides being priced at competitive prices with leading retail outlets, delivery to my home is the icing on the cake for me. I prefer the Fram line of products (convenience), although regular oil & air & filter changes with any brand is the key to good auto health."
3,Dog's loose interest,My dogs love the Kong but the snacks inside cant keep thier interest. I ended up just giving the snacks to them. They didn't like working hard for their snacks.
3,Good tasting snack,My dog loves the flavor and begs for these cookies but doesn't like them in the Kong as she can't get them out
4,An easy way to stuff a Kong,"My 4 month old goldendoodle really likes this cookie. You just squeeze the kong to lengthen the opening in order to stuff the fat end in. He eats the smaller end poking out of the outside pretty quickly. He used to give up on the remains inside, but now he tosses it on the ground over and over to break the cookie into pieces. It's kind of expensive, but it's easier than stuffing smaller pieces of food that just fall out, and gentler on his tummy than straight peanut butter."
5,Perfect for stuffing in the Kong toys,Kong Stuff'N Snacks make a perfect stuffer for the Kong Classic Dog Toy. Much better and less messy than peanut butter. Keeps the dogs occupied for at least 20 minutes or longer. And the dogs love 'em! Just wish they were a tad cheaper or had more in the package.
5,Picky Puppy Loves 'Em!!!,"My pup doesn't have an interest in treats and doesn't eat much, (never has, she's very healthy though) but she loves these treats. I use them in the large black Kong toy and it occupies her for hours."
3,Make sure your dog likes rubber toys,"I read all the rave reviews on line and purchased two different types of KONG toys along with the treats. My dog loves the treats but hates the toys. She does not like rubber toys. Crocs sandles, burkenstocks, sticks, rocks, just not rubber intended for dogs. Even with the treats inside she is still not motivated enough to chew on the toy to receive the reward. Before you purchase the expensive KONGS find out if your dog will like them."
5,Bully loves PB,"I purchased these to give my English Bulldog puppy. He loves the flavor, will definitely buy More.I stuff two with peanut butter into his Kong and he loves it."
4,Good Idea,They don't really fit in the toy I got them for but the Dog love them anyway and that's all the matters. When I did put them in the toy they really just licked the cookies until they where super mushy and getting them out was kinda gross
2,Not very appealing to my dogs,I bought these snacks to put in the many Kongs I have for my numerous dogs and none of them liked the snacks as much as they like peanut butter in the Kong. I don't know if it's because my dogs couldn't actually get the treats out because they tried initially but gave up relatively quickly. So I wouldn't buy these again and think I'll stick to peanut butter.
5,Our Dog,It seems that treats are just the thing for our semi-beagle dog.She really looks forward to her rewards.
3,Not the best way to stuff a Kong,I figured that the makers of the KONG would know the best way to keep my dog chewing productively for more than a couple of minutes - unfortunately I was disappointed. These only last a couple of minutes. I find that freezing actual peanut butter in her KONG is far more effective.
1,Terrible vacuum,"If I could give this vacuum a 0 rating, I would. After only 4-5 uses (Yes, I cleaned out the bin) it clogged up. The attachments only worked once and quit. I've bought several of the ""cheaper"" vacuums with good luck, but this one was absolutely terrible. As I'm sure you can tell, I would not recommend wasting your money."
1,Takes engaged parenting too far,"Everyone can agree that touch and love are the two best things in the world for a baby. This author takes it too far and sets unrealistic guidelines with anecdotal support for her position, versus real fact and extensive scientific research; for example, show me evidence where periodic use of bouncers have delayed the development of 6 month olds. I'm not suggesting the kid lives in there, but when mom and dad are making dinner, folding laundry, mowing and getting things done with two hands, at least the baby is doing something fun and is fully upright to watch everyone in the house.I suggest passing on this book and just love, talk to, and play with your baby... however you choose... and not be too hard on yourself as a parent if you need to put your kid down for a few minutes."
5,A must-have for study abroad!,"Another essential guide by Peterson's. They have compiled information about more than 1,700 study abroad programs. You just can't find a more comprehensive listing. A unique source since the Tannen/Winkler guide (""The Student's Guide to the Best Study Abroad Programs"") mentioned in the other review is out of print."
2,it's not bad,"everthying given by with good examples, suitable explanation , previous questions, faq, and also godd exercise questions,."
3,Shameless book filler,"I just received my copy of Java 1.1 Certification Study Guide. I haven't read it, but I was shocked to notice that pages 425 to 677 (35% of the book) are a shameless book filler! These pages contain, with abundant white space, a full listing of the JDK 1.1.3 API (only raw member signatures, no description or explanation). A two-paragraph introduction to this appendix readily admits that Sun's freely available docs are more complete. Those documents are also included in the enclosed CD-ROM. It is obvious that the API listing was printed only to make the book 50% thicker, perhaps to justify the hefty price and make the title more visible in book stores. It is a pity so many trees had to die for such greedy motives."
4,Excellent resource for certication,"This book is requisite for anyone who want to clear certication.The advantage to the readers of this book is that every topic discussed is to the point.there are certain objective like ""is a"" ""has a"" relationships among classes is left out in this book. The authors of this book has precise knowlwdge of pattern of examination. In all a must for java certifcation aspirant"
4,The fundamentals and Inner working of Java are explained,The fundamentals and Inner working of Java are explained very nicely. This book was the only book resource I used to study for the Exam. I passed the first time writing it.I studied approximately 2.5 weeks for the exam. The internet has good websites which helped alot by giving mock exams and tests (which are quite similar to the real exam).
3,I like this book,This book by simon roberts is a very fine book which helps even the beginners who are new to the language understand the concepts very clearly. I would even say that this is the best book for all those who want to take the JCP exam.Finally I would like to cong'late simon and philip for writing such a splendid book.
4,Excellent preparation Guide,"The book is good for the certification examination. However, I feel that the CD-Rom test is a farce. All the questions are from the back of each chapter on the book and there is nothing new to look forward to."
3,ok,"This book is ok but make sure you view the errata list first. There are a lot of typos in it, which in my opinion is unacceptable for a book that claims to be the best study guide on the market. Although publishing a book filled with typos seems to be the standard nowadays."
4,Very good study guide,This book clearly states the exam objectives and then visits each at the appropriate level of detail. It helped to understand a few concepts very clearly that I didn't grasp while developing distributed software systems using Java. This book also uncovers a few topics that are really important to understand to learn what is going under the hood although these topics are not part of the exam objectives. I can give this book a lot of credit to help me get my Certification by working smarter. The test provided on accompanying CD-ROM is also very helpful to find out fitness level to take the test.
3,A good source for Java Fundamentals,"While preparing for Java 1.1 Programmer Certification Examination recently, I used this book also as a reference. It serves as a good source to acquire knowledge on Java fundamentals. The review questions are ok. The practice test engine that comes with the book does not contain any questions that are new. The review questions in the book appear in some random order in the practice test. Thus, the practice test engine does not really help in any way in testing your skills after practice. Also, the questions in the practice test engine do not come anywhere near the actual examination questions as far as variety and toughness are concerned."
4,thorough reference text for core info.,"This book presents its information in a complete fashion. It is thorough in its presentation, and it offers useful questions/answers.It helped me pass the test (1.1)."
4,Really dificult exam,"Hi, I've passed 7 Microsoft Exams at first try, and this is the first exam i failed. The book is really good, but the exam is like a big .... Plenty of ambiguity and with some questions with logical errors. over all, practice practice and practice ....."
2,Suffers an identity crisis.,"The first few chapters were very good. It was quite instructive. However, the last few chapters gave up any attempt at being instructive. Worse still, many of the questions became quite banal and didn't seem to test understanding at all.The huge Class Library Appendix was a complete waste of space.The CD with the test engine would suffice."
5,a great book for the exam,"after i read this book i i felt that some concepts which is not quite clear to me got clarified. carefully study each of the choices for each questions,and read through the anwsers help me a lot to be familiar with the the form in real exam .the chapter about I/O is bit weak.overall it is book i would like to recommend to anyone who is going to pass the exam.(i got a score of 85% after read this book)"
4,Between the Lines,"Prior to reading this book, I purchased the Sun 'Core Java Fundamentals - Volume 1' which exposed me to Java programming. I then read this book. You need to know a bit about Java before purchasing this book. The book is a little lite on documentation, though if you're looking just to pass the certification, this book should do it. Be careful, though, you need to read every word, as if you were about to purchase your first house. The questions at the end of each chapter match exactly those in the sample test. To me, the questions in the book were simpler than the actual test. Good luck!"
5,The Best study guide out there!!!,"This book is a simply a must-have for those who are serious about taking the Java Certification exam. This books filled lot of the void left from Barry Boone's book. The author wrote the exam and he knows what he's talking about. However, I've wished that the questions were little more difficult, the ones in the exam were quite harder than the ones from the book. But all in all, it's the best study guide out there!"
2,This book can't compete with newer books on the market.,I recommend java 2 Exam Prep by Bill Brogden over this book. It's as if you are actually taking the test and covers Java2 which this doesn't. I wish I had bought only Brogden's book and saved a bundle.
5,EXCELLENT MATERIAL COVERAGE IN THE BOOK,WE ARE FROM A VERY POOR COUNTRY (india).COULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO SHIP THIS BOOK FOR FREE wE WILL BE VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU AM AND SAM
3,"Good, but not good enough at all","i studied java with this book only and failed the exam. this book is apparently well-organized, but not enough for you to cope with tricky questions on the real test. dont just rely on this book!!"
5,A-miss-it-NOT!,This one is very much focussed on the exams and explains certain concepts that you ARE required to know BEFORE you take the exam. I cleared it on the first shot! All the Best with this book!
2,"Good, but not a complete solution","This book is alright, in that it fills in many of the blanks left by other Java books. You'll learn more about Java by reading _Exploring Java_ (O'Reilly), but the latter doesn't help build test-taking abilities. I agree completely with the readers from Falls Church (see below), who tabulated how well the book helped them answer specific portions of the exam. I passed the exam on the first try, but barely--nowhere near the 90-95% I got on the practice test on CD-ROM (which is practically worthless). Watch out for the parts that don't sound particularly important in the book--the >>> operator was an especial pain in the ass. Use this book in conjunction with more in-depth works, as well as real-life programming experience."
4,Great book to get fundamental understanding of Java.,"I recently purchased this book to prepare for Java Certification. I believe everyone will be interested in the most intricate concepts this book highlights. Each and every line in this book makes an important meaning, so we have to be very attentive when reading the book and in understanding the fundamentals. The CD contents are not too good when compared to the book."
4,Great Book!!!,Very good book for certification test and helped a lot in pasing the test. Every line in the book is important and should be read carefully since the test engine is not so good. It would be better to go through the practice tests of Barry book and his test on the internet.
2,Unlike the Energizer bunny they don't keep going only recharging!,"I guess I acquired old stock, but this new set of batteries just do not last very long and I am constantly recharging them. Very disappointed."
1,Crappy Batteries,Charged them a few times but the power doesn't last long. You have to charge them a couple of times to make them last longer.
4,nice jazz organ,I bought this album for one number.....Misty! great arrangement and swing...you wont stay still on this number (or the whole allbum).
5,Great Jazz Organ,"I must admit, I'm a Hammond B-3 jazz organ fan, so who couldn't love to hear Groove Holmes work his magic? I think his ""Misty"" is one of the great jazz organ classics."
5,classic organ jazz,"like so many organ players richard is unique just as jimmy smith, these guys have so much feeling in their music."
2,Naturalizer Women't Sailor Mule,"The sole of the shoe is practically non-existent...true moccasin style. Good for indoors, but not recommended for any hefty outside use. Also, shoe stretched out too much leaving it 'floppy'."
3,Beware of Backing Vocals,"Paul Desmond was a great saxophonist. However, this album contains annoying background vocalists that distract one from Desmond's playing and only serve to feed the homicidal side of one's nature."
3,There's only one?!,I was disappointed that only one cover came in the package. However it fit my phone perfectly and was easy to apply.
3,Avoid this bra!,"As previous reviewer said, this bra is quite scratchy out of the box making it very uncomfortable. The side panels intended to create a nice line and provide more support are uncomfortable as they bunch up making your line very unattractive. I kept trying to pull the bra down all day long. The bra straps are not easy to adjust, I broke a nail trying to change one side. This was the worst bra I've ever purchased. While the price is right, the fit and comfort is not. I would look elsewhere."
2,Very innaccurate examples,The syntax on most of the examples were wrong. The book is too vague on some important topics. What I really found annoying was the wrong examples. I had to play around with some of the commands to find out the correct syntax. Not a good book for beginners or experts. I would not recommend this book.
4,"Get ""Classic Shell Scripting"" by Arnold Robbins instead..","This book is good, actually quite good, but for a beginner. The reason of the title and four stars is, for a beginner, I would still recomend the gold standard, age old ""The UNIX Programming Environment"" by Kernighan and Pike, the first five chapters (unless you know decent amount of C). If it comes to writing portable shell and also getting an introduction to Awk, the other two books are far better. No offenses to Stephen Kochan, I am a fan of his C book.. !"
4,First and only shell programming book I own,"I bought this book when it was originally published back in 1990. I started with little programming experience, and no shell programming experience. It brought me up to speed quickly. I no longer write many shell scripts; however, I still use it as a desk reference when I do. For any UNIX system administrator, this book (or one just like it) is essential.BTW, I have been looking for a better book all these years and haven't found one. It's not that I think this book is perfect, rather there just aren't many good books on this subject."
3,"No depth, good only for beginners","This book is good only for beginners. If you have scripting skills in another OS and want to learn UNIX shell programming to do real life scripting, this book will only give you cursory knowledge. It does not cover any useful scripting techniques. Overall, I would say you will need another book alongwith this to do what you want to do."
4,good for recommendation to new programmers,i found this book very helpful in learning unix shell programming it is very illustrative with easy to understand examples.
2,Disturbing is the word,"I have to agree with another reviewer that this was bottom line disturbing. I just couldn't believe the premise of this book, a young girl, who has grown up free, believes slavery is her only option? So she throws herself into it and becomes the perfect slave? Obeys every command to the point they torture her to figure out when she will break?She goes to a Duke who believes he is a great master but he routinely invites the maids to sit on his lap? I guess he was good because he didn't beat them but he sure took his time torturing anyone who wronged him. So much torture and oppression I just couldn't handle it. And of course in the end he ends up loving her? Unbelievable.Honestly the writing wasn't bad, that is what made me not stop reading but the world they live in is just sad and depressing. I guess maybe by the end of the books it will be a equal world but I'm not going to find out because this was enough. I read a ton of fantasy but this was too over the top."
3,"To much a ""Journey into It's Pasts"".",Overall a good read. However the extent and method to which young Hordern introduces the reader to the history of the Pacific becomes interruptive and eventually annoying. Had he separated story from history it would have been a more enjoyable and readable book.
1,Not worth the candle,I strugled through 50 pages of repetition. I am taking it back to the library today.
2,"morose, single handed journey","Rather than tell the story of his singlehanding from England to New Zealand, sailing the pacific is his story of a six month singlehand sail from Auckland to Chile, then to Tahiti, then an aborted attempt to return to New Zealand. In it we get to find out just how dull it is to sail by yourself in the roaring forty's, find no particular reason or purpose in Chile, find out how demoralizing it is to be becalmed, and then when finally reaching Tahiti, how miserable a place it is, albeit better than being out on the water alone. I read through the whole book and couldn't figure out why he took the journey, and certainly couldn't figure out why he felt the need to share it. It does contain a lot of history of the early explorers/map makers/etc to the region."
2,Content No Sufficient,"I'm going to make short here. The topic covered in this book is not detail enough. A lot of important detail in inner class, AWT, Layout manager, Thread, contructor override and overload is not cover in depth detail. The concept in the book is straight and simple. It may be good to understand. However to pass your examination, you need more than what is covered in the topic of this book. My suggestion is why spend so much money buying a book that doesn't give whatu need to pass your examination.I would suggest you go for ""The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide: Programmer's and Developers Exams (With CD-ROM) -- by Simon Roberts""."
2,No a good book,I was disappointed in this book. It contained many errors and typos. This is not recommended for anyone who want to prepare thoroughly for the exam. I'm on my second study guide to prepare for the exam. One of the earlier reviewer was on the money about his review. I should have listened.
1,FILLED WITH TYPOS!,"I bought the original version of this book. It had so many typos that I returned it. The publisher sent me this 3rd edition, and said things are corrected. I just started using it today. I decided to start with the practice exams on the cd to see where I needed improving. I got through 14 questions. 4 of them had typos. 2 of those were typos such that you could not figure out the correct answer. Some of the other typos were so obvious they should have been caught by even a nontechnical proofreader. After my experience with the first version (see the many horrible reviews for it to see just how bad it was) and seeing the typos in the practice exams, I am not going to waste my time with any more of the McGraw Hill Java books."
2,No coverage of real stuff,"This book only covers what a novice programmer already know. It doesn't really cover the more difficult topics tested in the exam. I'd highly recommend that you consider the ""Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide"" which explains the difficult topics in a clear, concise and detailed manner."
5,Happy surprise,"This is such a lovely and unusual film about a group of relative strangers on a journey together. I don't really know how else to describe it without going into huge detail, but it is sad and funny and absolutely a film to be watched and re-watched."
4,so far so good,"so far so good I haven't had any probelms & they look very realistic, I had Tom walk right up to them."
5,Packable,"Used these last season. Easy to carry and setup. Realistic coloring. No success in calling a bird in, but will try again this spring. All fit nicely in the vest pouch."
5,Not just for Coaches ... Beneficial for Parents!,"This book is, in my opinion, of great benefit to the parents of AD/HD teens and college students. So many parents have had the experience of their AD/HD child going off to college and having their lives fall apart. Without the structure that they have been used to through high school, these teens often meet challenges that they are unprepared to handle. This book was extremely helpful to me as the parent of a genius-level ADD son. So many times I would read a passage and be shocked that the authors had just described my son to perfection.BTW, my son is a sophomore at UNC where author Theresa Maitland is on staff in The UNC Learning Center. Her work with college students with AD/HD is truly a daily occurrence and her department's success rate is phenomenal."
2,red herring,"This is a colloboration between turkish and flamenco artists and has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO with andaluse music or Chiekh Raymond. The artists involved are fine performers, and overall the album is an unusually successful fusion. It is disturbing that the liner notes seem to indicate that the Erguners, who are great masters of turkish music, are utterly ignorant of the fact that there is a living Andaluse-music tradition throughout North-Africa...I repeat, although this is a sometimes-charming fusion, it is not in any way Andaluse Music."
2,Excellent instrumental talent marred by cacaphonous vocals,"This should be a brilliant album and has moments of sheer inspiration. However, even for the most ardent fan of Andalusian music, the vocals are trying. The effect is like spray paint on the Alhambra."
2,Not the greatest...,"""Hungry"" is disappointing. I mostly agree with the first reviewer, though I'm not a big Zagat fan -- Jonathan Gold's book ""Counter Intelligence"" is better than Zagat or ""Hungry.""And it's hilarious that every ""review"" since the first one has been an utter rave, and they all voted the first review ""not useful""...they're not very subtle about their ballot-box stuffing! :-)Anyway, don't take the phony votes at face-value - if you have to, thumb through it at a bookstore before you buy."
2,don't bother,"there are several other food guides that are both more informative and better reads. unless youre just looking to add this to your collection of restauant guides, dont bother."
2,Good information poorly organised and presented,"I found the text itself informative, but difficult to follow. There is an attempt at organisation into regions, which later changes to time periods. The writing was, at times, quite convoluted - a jump from 7th century to 17th century and back to 12th century in the same paragraph (or sometimes in the same sentance) was not uncommon.The illustrations were all black and white despite being described in several captions as colour; they were frequently slightly out of focus, and in some cases important details had been cropped from the edges. This despite more than 60% of the book being pictures rather than text.There is a lot of important information in this book, but the disjointed style, poor quality of the illustrations and poor layout make this book impractical as a learning tool. I hope a later edition will remedy many of these problems."
1,counterfeit part,"This is clearly a counterfeit part. It is too short and too narrow for the shaft assembly, though the packaging seems authentic."
3,very basic!,"OK,this is a very good video for someone just learning to sew, for anyone who has been thru design school or is an experienced seamstress, you might be a tad bit disapointed.she is a very good instructor, visuals and up-close was exceptional. all of the stiches (and there was a lot about stiches) are basic to anyone who sews. i learned nothing new here, (but i have been sewing for over 20 years) and nothing meaningful about couture techniques. the book gives a lot more information, and using one of her custom couture patterns (from vogue) to put it all together sure will help if you are trying to be a better seamstress or perfect your skills.The price is good though, and she has a very good closet of old couture garments that she shows the inside construction of.Am looking forward to videos 2 and 3, intermediate and advanced...."
4,Too long to ship,"This video is the best for a beginner, seasoned home sewer, or the aspiring seamstress. Ms. Shaeffer's DVD is an excellent source of information with detailed examples on sewing techniques that you cannot pass. I have done tons of alterations on my clothes including leather jackets and a $950 Burberry coat. I am a petite size, and the sleeves, hems and waist of most garments are too long, or big for my frame. I like to wear nice clothes that fit well, and I do not wish to pay an arm and a leg for an alteration at my local dry cleaner. Dry cleaners have lost my garments in the past, and it has been a nightmare experience. If you purchase her video, buy her book too. You'll be glad you did!. BEWARE: This seller took almost too weeks to ship her DVD, I will never use them again. Please save yourself the headache and buy it at your local bookstore."
1,"""Garbage!""","Unfortunatly, the ""Garbage"" is already used for a band!! This has to be the worst band I have ever heard!!!! It sounds like it was recorded in a toilet!! Which is where this CD should be placed!!! Thank God you can hear it first!! This is terrible!!!!!"
1,Wretched!,This is the worst stuff I have heard on sale! It is so bad that I can't believe it is legitimate. This has to be a joke!
4,Evil Super-Intelligent Manmade Dog Escapes Government Lab & Kills,"Excellent read that's impossible to put down. Genetically engineered German Shepard (named Phantom) escapes a secret government lab to kill and terrorize the small rural community of Fallsburg, New York (and then part of the Bronx in New York City). You see, he can't help himself, its in his genes, some of which were transplanted from a criminal while Phantom was still a embroyo puppy."
1,READ ALL THE FACTS FIRST,I rarely pay attention to the details that they give you. READ THEM before making a purchase. Don't make the same stupid mistake I made. There is no way I could used this bag for school. I does not look good as a purse. So it's basically pointless.
2,Mr. Musto Can and Has Done Much Better,"Michael Musto is fabulous, but ""Manhattan on the Rocks"" isn't. Please buy his nonfiction book ""Downtown"" instead."
3,"Good, not great","A basic introductory text that (for me) has too many overlapping topics strewn through different chapters. It could use better editing to re-organize the materials. Also, many of the photos are distracting, unnecessary and add nothing to the text. To me this is more of a high school than a college text."
3,Just the basics,You can easily skim this book and get the basics of Political Science. This is a helpful study guide for CLEP exams.
1,what a disappointment,"I bought this book last month in St. Louis, on my first journey across Route 66. I love ghost stories, so I was extremely excited to read the book and do some ghost-hunting on my journey. Shah! Most of the houses/hotels/etc aren't even on 66; a lot of them are in cities that 66 doesn't cross through. The only story I even cared for was the one about Spook Light in Oklahoma. Who I didn't see. Should've saved my ten bucks for a cheesy Route 66 tin shield at one of the gift shops along the way."
4,Chained Eagle,"I was married to a Navy pilot during the Vietnam war and remember well the story of Everett Alvarez. However, reading the book and his story of captivity was illuminating and I think is a must-read for everyone. It tells us what we didn't know but should. I also read the story of Jim Thompson's captivity and it was interesting in that Alvarez and Thompson were such different people with such different outcomes."
3,Looses it's focus.,"A nice work but obviously expanded beyond the original intent. The book is more about the war in the Phillipines rather than "" just"" submarine rescues."
5,Brag for Life!,"Some books entertain, others educate, and the occasional few do both.This book's has got it all. So you want women's liberation? Try bringing up your missionary family as a single mom in the mountains of Negros during a war. So you be a businessman? How about blowing up those sugar cane factories before the Japanese get 'em. You just like that war thang? This book will send you to the dictionary to look up all those really great technical submariner words and touch your heart as the bell is rung for each sub that didn't make it back. It's gotcha rooting for the good guys and holding your breath with the suspense.So it reminds of a Royal Carribean Cruise ad with my own addition: Brag for Life! Get out there! Learn something!P.S. Liked this book? Try a ""A Peace to End All Peace."" Get out there... learn something."
5,Makes you proud of the men who did this.,The writer has a great way of keeping you interested in how the days before the rescue are being lived by the rescuers and the rescued. Life on the run in the Philippines during the war is described very vividly. Great story telling!
3,Canceled Order,"I canceled the order because the book would not get to me in time, and I did not want to pay for the express shipping."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because it was cheap and got good reviews. I love a good suspense, trapped-in-the-wilderness type novel, so I was excited to read this. However, even though the storyline was decent, I found the writing and characterization quite mediocre and amateurish. There were some interesting and unique elements to the book, but the lack of characterization and stilted dialogue made this a wall banger for me."
2,Yuck!!!,"What do you get when you mix a sappy Harlequin Romance with a cheesy attempt to copy Michael Crichton's Timeline? Right...you get this way less than compelling book...The River. Run-of-the-mill science, pretty poor writing, silly plot, sappy dialouge, and way too much emphasis on ""romance."" Trapped in a life-threatening situation, the fate of the world hanging in the balance, and the main character is worried about whether or not the ""tall dark, and handsome"" male lead is flirting with her. I say again...Yuck! Don't waste your cash. Buy/read something better."
5,"Suspense from start to finish in ""The River""","In her novel ""The River"", Cheryl Kaye Tardif immediately establishes suspense and maintains it throughout. The characters are well developed and connected in interesting ways. The story moves along quickly and kept me intrigued from start to finish. I learned a great deal about native Indian legends and lore, white water rafting techniques and the challenges of survival in the Canadian wilderness. Very enjoyable. Highly recommended."
4,Didn't see that ending coming,"Good eerie story. Kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The ending was strange until I thought about it, then I understood what happened."
5,Excellent!,"I thought this book was very futuristic and fun. I thought the ending was very bittersweet, but it was still a great read."
4,Good suspense,Well crafted storyline. Main character three dimensional secondary characters a little weak but overall a good story. Disappointed with the ending cos it seemed to end before the story as if there will be a sequel and I don't think this has sequel potential.
2,Poorly written,"This was a fair attempt, and there were some interesting elements. Overall, though, it was not a compelling story and the characters were a little annoying. Too many people were ""scowling,"" ""growling,"" and ""yelping"" at one another."
2,"Sensationalist, poorly executed","I wasn't thrilled with this story. The characters manage to be both shallow and comically ""deep"" in different places- you know almost nothing about any of them, but they develop Twilight-esque attachments in an instant. The plot revolves are sensationalist ""stem cell research gone wrong"" science like you would see in a right-wing conspiracy magazine. I found the setting interesting, and the native american folklore bits, but all in all this was a dud."
3,HUH?,"Having previously read this author I was expecting a lot more than this book delivered. The storyline, action and characters were good. It started slow but really picked up about 50 or so pages in. But the end was the perfect set-up for the sequel, only apparently there isn't one.The last chapter was so incomplete, I couldn't believe I had read the last page! There was no closure to the story! Spoiler alert!!!!! Was Jake alive? Was her baby okay (only one DNA being able to transport)? And who was the director? Over and over through the book the question arose about the identity of the director and then it is never answered!But I am an optimistic person and I hope the author has a sequel planned, because that would change my 3 stars to 5 stars immediately if I thought the story would be finished to its end!"
3,finished it in one day BUT...,"Warning: ending mentioned!I started reading this book on my Kindle and honestly stayed up the ENTIRE NIGHT to finish it. It drew me in and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. And then it ended and I went ""uh...what????"" One of the worst endings I have read in years. It just ENDED. I think the author TRIED to wrap up the threads of the story but it did NOT work. The entire ending of the book was confusing and just left me hanging. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the ending. I honestly wish I had never started reading the book because of how it ended..."
4,stayed up all night reading,"This book hooked me from the beginning, and I really could not put it down. As I read it I wondered if it was somewhat the basis for the recent Tv show of the same name. An archaeologist and her friends heading down a mysterious river to find her missing father, encountering many strange things along the way. I was slightly disappointed in the loose ends left at the end, but I'd read more by this author."
2,Not impressed,"To be honest, I'm rather puzzled by the numerous positive ratings of this book. I figured I would try it out, as it was free for kindle, but I was pretty disappointed.The romance in the book develops far too quickly and comes off as entirely unbelievable. Many of the plot points are silly and are meant to be creepy rather than realistic. And the protagonist is incredibly foolish despite the fact that she is supposed to be a highly respected anthropologist.All in all, I didn't buy into the story in the slightest and was thoroughly put off by the ending, which posed more questions than it answered. I get the feeling that the five star reviews come from people who don't read quite as avidly as some and don't know the difference between good sci-fi and bad sci-fi."
3,forgot an ending,I liked the book BUT the last chapter was like the author didn't leave enough time to write it. It was rushed and left so many plot lines unresolved. Really a disappointment.
2,Disguised romance novel,"Upon Del's first collision with Jake, I knew I had been snookered! Some time ago, I quit reading mystery novels that really were romance novels--now I have to add horror/sci-fi/romance to my list of high school level time-wasters!The story concept itself was good, but the characters were contrived, and a great deal of the writing left a lot to be desired. ""Flu"" is a disease, not a part of a chimney; there were a couple of grammatical errors; strange adjectives--a ""sinful"" smile? Poor writing or poor editing? Either way, it gave the book the feel of a writing class assignment.The best element of the book was the nanotechnology horror idea. It would have been been better without the silly time-travel device. The reason for all the murders (harvesting stem cells) has been rendered obsolete by advances in cloning stem cells.Overall, it was not a good read, in my opinion, but it would make a great movie!"
3,Book was engaging but characters were a dud,"I enjoyed the flow of The River and it was quite engaging until it got to the sections regarding the character interactions and personalities. Their relationships read like something out of a Harlequin romance novel where the women are supposed to be these level headed ""strong"" women yet always get ditzy and frustrated when it comes to their stereotypical ""rogue"" male counterpart. It's so frustrating to read these sections especially when the story is actually good. This book attempts to be an action/thriller book with characters from a bad rom/com movie. Give us women credit, will ya?"
1,Not a Great Read,"This book promised way more than it delivered. The premise was interesting, as was the locale. But they were lost in poor writing, stereotyped shallow characters, all wrapped in a quick love story that seemed superficial, sappy, and just plain unenjoyable and unbelievable. Having previously read Tardif's Whale Song, a delightful book written for young people, I looked forward to reading her adult fiction. Not any more. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Meh...,"This story is OK, but fairly predictable. Worth your while to read, but don't expect too much. One comment: What's with TJ calling everyone ""Dawg""? Is this slang that I've never heard, or do some people really call other people that?"
2,cheap,"this jeli sleeve is cheap and doesn't cover the screen, also it is loose so it is hard to use the scroll disc. I am going to try to find one of the silicon feel types. It works slightly as a protector which I guess is good."
5,Great for kids,"My son loves these dinosaurs! Even my three-year-old daughter enjoys interchanging the pieces. We bought two more sets after this one, so they would have more pieces to use."
3,Why would anyone . ..,"The Geo Trax system is OK, but why, oh why, would anyone sell a ""deluxe giftset"" without including sufficient track to use all of the pieces. Tell that to your grandchild on Christmas Day."
4,Adorable,Made this cake for easter and it turned out adorable. I was worried it wasn't going to make it in time but it did! The pan was a bit dented but it wasn't anything that effected the cake. I plan on ordering more pans in the future.
1,bunny pan,This bunny pan was a waste of time. When inverted there was no imprint to look like the bunny. It looked like a Giant Dog Bone Cake so if you are looking for adog bone cake it would work fine but not for a bunny cake. Would not buy this product.
4,a pedagogy of self: authethnographic writing/teaching,"I was very interested in this book because autoethnography is difficult to do and as a research methodology its much maligned as being ""navel gazing"". However, there is much to learn from the intrapsychic ponderings of individuals. The internal dialogue we have with ourselves is an important source of information for us and our life trajectory that it would be useful to share. I am almost finished and really enjoy the way the author creates a novel of the methodology as a means of illustrating the progression."
2,"Weak, as usual for this brand","I bought this recently, not paying attention to brand. When I got it home, I realized it was Stash, and thought, oh, no, here comes the weak tea!Indeed, as with other of their teas, it is weak. I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor. When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall. Will not purchase again."
2,Gross,"Tasted artificial, weird, unnatural. Could not detect the orange peel ""note"" at all. Singular, not balanced. Very pretty color and pleasant aroma. Unfortunately, I sent it back ):"
5,Creamy Strawberry,"I love this tea. It has an AMAZING creamy strawberry scent and I just can't get enough of it!Unfortunately like with most teas, the scent is better than taste. I like mixing it with lemon juice and honey - it gets to be simply divine!I like using my big mug and have to put 2 tea bags to get the right flavor. I have a feeling I'll go through it pretty quick. I drink it every day and would recommend this tea to everyone."
1,Not even a hint of passionfruit,There is not even a hint of passion fruit nor mango in this tea. One can only taste an overpowering amount of rose hips and citrus peel.
2,Yuck,"I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry. The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting. Couldn't taste the strawberry. Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea. I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up. When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'. I was right.Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers."
3,This is NOT Black tea with Black currant - it is an HERBAL BLEND,Be warned - if you are looking for real tea with balck current - this is not it
1,TERRIBLE TASTE,"I was excited about receiving decaf tea, but it tastes absolutely horrible! I can't even drink a full cup of it, I tried making it several different ways, but it is not good at all. Just donated the unopened boxes of it to a food kitchen, I hope someone there enjoys it. I love all different kinds of tea, but this was the worst I've ever had!"
1,Danger for anyone with HIGH Blood Pressure,"The Licorice spice tea is fragrant and delicious.I was given some to try, and was so excited about this tea. I added it to my amazon.comsubscriptions. Several days later I mentioned this tea to my Doctor. He gave me astrict warning against ANY kind od black Licorice.This tea and all black licorice products need clearly posted warnings.Not for consumption by anyone with high Blood pressure, or on blood pressure medicines.The package had not yet arrived, I contacted amazon for return instructions and was told it is not return or refundable! Very unhappy :(Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
4,My favorite,"I have tried several of the Stash herbal teas (and other brands), and this is my favorite. As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, it is a little weak when compared to other brands, but the flavor makes up for that, in my opinion, and I do not always want a strong tea."
5,Stash Meyer Lemon Tea,"Stash tea's are a quality tea. Meyer Lemon makes a wonderful iced tea. Contains Lemongrass, orange peel, and Meyer Lemon oil, so there is no need to add fresh lemon to the iced tea. This herbal tea is also caffeine free.Herbal Tea-Meyer Lemon - 20 - Bag"
5,Great for respiratory support,"My 8yo son has asthma and we got this on the advice of a friend to help with minor symptoms and hopefully prevent some need of his rescue inhaler. We ALL love the taste with no sweetener, and while it regularly soothes his throat, we all use and enjoy it for sore throats and to loosen congestion and mucus. The herbal combination is great for respiratory support, and is much more enjoyable than getting out his inhaler. We love it!"
4,Stash Premium Peppermint Herbal Tea,Very nice product. It was fresh and in date and shipped quickly. Thanks.
5,Stash Acai Berry tea,"Not as tasty as some of the other Stash Berry teas, but nonetheless quite refreshing."
5,"Full-flavored, delicious tea that you can drink at night",This tea is so fruity and full-flavored that it makes a great iced tea too. Caffeine-free so you can have any time of the day without being up all night. Fantastic!
5,maintained the highest expectations,I knew what I was ordering and I knew what I recieved. It's the best at a fraction of the cost
3,Something strange,"I love the taste of this herbal tea, but twice now I noticed I have a rasping (breathing discomfort) that may or may not be triggered by it. I bought 4 boxes after trying a sampler but now I'm starting to think I may have a food sensitivity to one of the licorice spice ingredients. Damn shame, but I wanted to put it out there in case I wasn't the only one."
2,STASH LEMON GINGER TEA (CAFFEINE FREE),"I purchased due to one of the review saying this was much better than yoki tea,I feel this tea has a bitter taste and not much ginger,in fact I added ginger,which did not help the taste at all."
2,Disappointed,I thought for sure I was going to love this tea. I love licorice and I like my teas sweet. I was so disappointed in the flavor of this product! It has very little licorice taste and an almost sickening after taste and smell. I added sugar to it as I did not find it very sweet. I ordered the 6 box pack of this so I guess I have 5 boxes of it to give away
4,Tatsteh Tea,"This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!"
4,Very fruity flavored herbal tea,Not one of my Stash favorites but it's supposed to be good for you so I bought it. It's a bit too fruity and sweet for my taste but if that's what you like than this tea is for you.
3,Too much of a licorice smell and taste,"Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better."
2,Rather weak and non-descript tea,"There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting. Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian LicoriceYogi Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)and that one actually has a bold licorice taste. And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea. Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own. This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste. I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal)."
5,Wonderful flavor without caffeine,"How many good-tasting teas are out there which don't have caffeine? Not too many. Even decaffeinated tea has some residual caffeine, which can be felt by those who avoid it entirely. That leaves herbal teas,and many are laced with cloying, artificial-tasting added flavors .Not this one. I never get tired of this tea and drink it every day after dinner. To me it's a wonderful feeling: the day is done and finally I can relax with a hot cup of this tea and an online sudoku."
5,five star product,"Very good product, my wife drinks it all the time. Stash premium licorice to her is very good tasteing."
5,Hands down my favorite tea!,"I've been ""addicted"" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea. I put forth Licorice Spice as my favorite and she said her all time favorite was, surprisingly enough, a tea made by Aveda - the haircare company - called Comforting Tea. She lamented that she found it hard to find and described the taste to me. I immediately told her that she had to try Licorice Spice then. A few days after my recommendation she emailed me that she had tried the Stash tea and it was EVEN BETTER than the Aveda one! I so do love making converts!As an added bonus, I've discovered after many nights of letting the tea steep, forgetting about the cup I've made, but not wanting to waste the tea bag - it tastes really good cold too!"
4,Oregon replacement blades for John Deere 525 Mower,Blades were as good as originals and they were delivered very quickly. I had them installed and working the same day they were delivered.
1,Virtually Unreadable,"The clumsy use of language caused me such acute pain, that even though I love the subject and period, I was unable to push myself on through it, even with a reasonable distraction, like brushing my teeth at the same time. It set my teeth on edge!"
2,disappointing..,"Tedious details repeated over and over, an unlikable main character, and historical references not fully explained, make for a rather disappointing ""Elizabethan mystery"" novel. The secondary characters were far more interesting (and sympathetic) than Elizabeth, but alas!--we, as readers, do not get much more than a few fleeting pages in their points of view. Also, a final reference page noting what was historical and what was fiction would have been greatly appreciated."
2,Boring,"This story is set in the time period before Elizabeth is queen. Her sister, Mary, hates her and someone is poisoning Elizabeth's relatives. It took me about a month to read it simply because I would fall asleep everytime I picked it up.While Elizabethan history is always interesting, I thought this book was rather slow. The idea for the story was great, but the plot trudged along sluggishly.The supporting characters weren't at all interesting. Jinks, Ned Topside and Meg were too one-dimensional. The reader doesn't get to know them very well. I didn't really care about them like I probably should have. Having Elizabeth run around in boys' outfits was almost silly.There were a few suspenseful moments, but for the most part it was dull. I didn't realy care if she found who was killer was or not. Overall, the book was mildly interesting."
3,Not the best,"I picked up this book clearly by chance. I saw the cover and thought it looked interesting, and I love historical fiction. I read the reviews and thought it would be a mystery/romance. It was an okay mystery but there was zitlch romance. And maybe you have to know alot about Elizabeth's life to figure out who the poisoner was because I totally had no clue until the author actually spelled it out for me. I think I will read the next book just to see what happens, but I won't by it unless there is a complete turn around in the writing style."
3,A confusing story,The plot of the book was good but there were times when I was so confused about what was going on. The ending did redeem the book so I will be trying out another book in the series to see if the next story line is a little less confusing.
3,Whimsical mystery for Elizabethan fans,"A good little book, especially for younger readers interested in this period of history. Fanciful setting, entertaining characters and a fun spin on history."
2,Not enough depth of character...,"I think the idea of Elizabeth I as a detective is superb; however, the plot and writing just do not live up to the great concept. ""Bess"" is shallow and haughty, and the other characters are cardboard cutouts. The mystery plot was so-so. Even though Elizabeth is not a character in this series, I still feel that Edward Marston's theatre mysteries are the best depiction of Elizabethan times."
1,...,"This work was horrible! I read the second in the series just to give the author a second chance. She should stick to romance! Her history is wrong; her characters are under-developed; and she writes of Mary & the Catholics much the same as Hitler would have written about the Jews. Neither Mary nor her adherents were that disliked, (harper forgets the sense of propriety that is so endemic to the English), nor was 'Bess' that popular.My time, (and yours, gentle reader), would be better spent reading the label on a StarFish tuna can. I should rate this a negative two stars, if allowed.Harper appears to have jumped on a bandwagon of interest in historically set who-done-its; and does a grave, (no pun intended), dis-service to Peters, Saylor, Roberts, Davis, Doherty, Robb, Newman, and so many others. Shame!"
5,Angel +princess=Best Cloe ever made!,"I luv this doll so much!She is beautiful doll!Yall`agree with me ,right?Great.This doll has beautiful golden hair,b-eau-ti-ful outfits, and tons of stylin accesories.I absolutely,100% garrantee DO NOT support RubyEspessaily what she said about Sara.And to be honest,Nobody should.So DO NOT vote Ruby helpful.She is NOT even a bit helpful.She`s mean to my great friend that did nothing to her.LGP3LNCEVERYTHING LUVERFOREVERIN ALL ETERNITYROCK SQUARED"
3,Princess,"I loved this one and the Jade Princess. The accessories are cool. However, I like to change up the hair on Bratz, and I found it difficult to work with this one. However, if you are not into changing up the hair, this is a great purchase."
5,cloe princess doll,i love this doll because the look of her is sort of like ballet couture but someone said that they were adding two girls in those girls are Diona and ciara and they are the new wicked twiins look on mgae.com then go to products and look for wicked twiins i think there supposed to be the step sisters in like cinderella
3,Ewwww,"Sorry to dissapoint(sp?) you, but I don't love this doll. The skirt strikes me as hideous, the top looks wrong. THe doll itself is pretty, and the other outfit is to. Don't hurt me now!PS STOP YELLING AT EACH OTHER NO ONE EVEN KNOWS WHO SARA OR RUBY OR ANYONE IS"
4,my god,My god I cant stand ruby! She is so mean!She has been to every my scene page and every bratz page!and all she talks about is howugly and bad bratz and my scene look!And its like every doll she sees she hates it.I mean what doll dose she like?
3,Book needs updating,"The third edition, copyright 2006, often seems outdated. The examples and references are usually from the 1980's or 1990's. The authors provided a new edition, but I don't see that much effort went into actually updating the material. They don't even introduce object oriented approaches until the last chapter of the book. It's almost like it's an afterthought. They also don't provide much information on RAD or agile methods.I feel like I bought a circa 1999 book. Disappointing."
4,DVD & Video Guide-2005,"I'm not an every movie fan, and I like to know a little about what I am buying. This book is very comprehensive and complete for 2005. Don't always agree with all reviews, however. For a real movie buff, this book is a must."
1,Bad quality product. I can't get it to work at all....stay away....,This is a very bad product don't order it. It never finish to charge. Only has about 90% of the specified capacity. After a discharge refuses to charge again. When discharging jumps from 30% to 0% and the Notebook turns off whit out any warning...Don't buy this thing
1,From 6 hours down to 2 after 1 month,I was so happy to have extensive battery life.... and within 1 month it's down to about 2 1/2 hours.

2,problems,"Beware, if you purchase this mirror switch plate you will probably need to order an acrylic spacer to fit behind it. It does not have a concave back to fit over typical electric wall housing for the switch. Difficult to explain, but trust me,,, you may have to recess your electric box for the switch to get this plate to work,"
5,Travel writing and adventure at its best,"2006 marks the 50th anniversary of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate Highways - and marking the occasion is LAPPING AMERICA: A MAN, A CORVETTE, AND THE INTERSTATES which follows Smith's cross-country journey. Travel writing and adventure at its best, LAPPING AMERICA provides both a history of these highways and their conception and development with realities of travel, making for a vivid 'you are there' memoir celebrating both.Diane C.

5,Back-to-Basics is Better for Butter!,"I LOVE this butter bell. I read about it on a blog and thought I'd try it out. Other reviews I read stated that the butter sometimes falls out into the water, but I've not had that problem. You just have to make sure that the butter doesn't have a lot of air bubbles when you put it into the bell. The butter is perfectly spreadable and fresh--as long as you change the water every few days, which I just do whenever I use it. I highly recommend this for fans of butter who hate the trouble spreading. Also, the green color is very smart. I love it!"
3,Too small for average size family and fragile,When I received this is was broke inside the box and seems to be very fragile. I didn't like the small cup that is attached to the lid and stores upside down. I sent the broken one back and they replaced it. Decided to keep it for a gift.
4,"Pretty, but not colbalt like I thought","This was a much more muted dark blue, I thought it'd be a brighter colbalt blue. But as a dish it works great."
5,Butter Bell Rocks!,"This is a great product! I absolutely love it - it's so handy for cooking and spreading, and attractive enough to put on the table."
5,Butterbell,Very happy. Use everyday. If in warmer coastal climate need to pay attention to more regularly. But worth the effort.
2,NOT for warm climate,"In principle, this product (butter crock bell) may be a good idea. If you live in mostly very warm climate zones and you set your A/C thermostat in your home to 78 - 80 deg F (or higher), and you use butter sparingly (such as in a one-person household, in So. Arizona), you may want to consider other options for storing butter. It does NOT work well for me (for unsalted butter). I am glad I still have a (plastic) ""butter squeezer"" that I keep in the fridge and microwave for 18 seconds before use in order to get the butter ""spreadable"". The butter in the ""bell crock"" is too soft and it does not have a fresh appearance at a room temperature of around 79 deg F."
3,"Nice product, inaccurate picture (color)","Just received this item, and while it seems to work fine, it's worth mentioning that this particular item is NOT gray, as shown in the picture. In fact, the item is exactly as described (not as pictured), a stark black in a matte (not glossy) finish. It looks nice and all, but it's not what I ordered, and according to the Butter Bell people, they don't even make one in gray."
4,"Good idea, I guess !","I've looked at these for a couple years and finally decided to take the plunge. We've always kept our butter either in the fridge where it's fresh, but too hard to spread and readily use, or on the counter in a butter dish where it's quite spreadable, but doesn't stay fresh all that long. This device does keep the butter fresh and spreadable out on the counter, but is a bit of a pain to use. You're supposed to replace the water every 3 days very easy to do, but good luck remembering to do it, and it's a pain to take a cube of butter out of the fridge, let it soften so you can mash it into the bell on the bottom of this thing. Attractive on the counter and keeps butter fresh, just not sure it's worth the trouble."
2,Huh - kinda cool - I guess,"Bought one because I like fresh butter, but don't like how butter yellows when left in the air. Used if for a couple of weeks, then the novelty wore off (coincided with the slimey mess that needed to be washed off every few days).The best part of it is that you'll begin getting ""special offer"" spam from the company that sells these things. Does anybody really need more than one butter bell?"
5,Butter believe it,"What a neat way of having spreadable butter ready at all times. I changed the water daily which I think will be even more necessary come the summer. I don't use loads of butter daily and I think it was just starting to sour when I used the last of it, so I won't be packing it as full from now on. That's strictly a personal thing. Very attractive and it got comments at a recent dinner party. I could have sold two or three if I had them. :)"
5,Love My Crock!!!!,"This is a great gadget EVERYONE who loves butter should have. Kept at the perfect temperature, butter is easily spread. No hard butter in this house anymore! That means no torn bread, no trying to slice butter thin enough so it will melt, just nice, smooth, yummy butter ready for all your cooking needs."
5,Red Butter Bell,"This is a great product if you like soft butter, cream cheese or margarine for your toast, bagels & muffins. It keeps the butter soft while potecting it from spoiling or separating."
2,Color not as described,"The description of this butter bell reads, ""White with Blue Banding"". When the butter bell arrived, I found it to be cream-colored with blue-banding. It wasn't just an ""antique white"", but rather a pinkish cream. So if you're picky about how this bell coordinates with the rest of your kitchen, beware!"
5,A constant resource and lovely dream book.,"I have used this book since it was published in the 1970's. It was my dream book, idea book and is still my tutor. I have at least 40 gardening books and I still return to the dogeared copy of this when I can't get an answer anywhere else!"
1,does not work!,"i bought this product for a 2500 sq ft house, says 1 can for 6000. put a can in each room, cleaned up and also used the spray. that night still had fleas, now they are worse than ever. i would never buy an adams product again."
3,It's a puzzle,"Puzzle was what I expected. Quality ok. Seems a little pricey. Color good, pieces shaped correctly. Purchased for granddaughter and she liked it."
3,"Nice map of US, strange omission of the rest of the world","This puzzle is colorful, sturdy, and the pieces fit well together. HOWEVER, the use of blue all around the United States gives the bizarre and totally inaccurate impression that the US does not share any borders with other countries. My son who is only three noticed this immediately and was confused. This is even worse than the beige expanse of nothingness used to depict Canada and Mexico on our other USA map puzzle (Crocodile Creek).Another annoying aspect, but for which I can imagine practical reasons, is that several smaller eastern states are lumped together into one piece, and NY State actually appears on two different pieces. The ""51 pieces"" includes many pieces of ocean."
2,Not the usual quality from doug and melissa,"I agree with the person who said it needs a cardboard backing or border. Since the puzzle is so large and it doesn't interlock, the pieces move when my son adds a state which makes him angry--he is not yet 3. I have to hold down the pieces when he adds the states and if I'm not available to help he gets frustrated. In addition, because some of the pieces are so large (oceans and texas) they tend to warp more than Doug and Melissa's other floor puzzles.The puzzle's saving grace is my son has learned all states in a week."
1,warped and hard to put together,The puzzle needs a cardboard backing to insert the pieces. The pieces are warped and they do not stay together. This puzzle is very difficult to put together with out a backing.
4,Fun Puzzle,We've had this puzzle for 2 years and my 4 y.o. continues to enjoy putting this puzzle together with assistance. The pieces slide around easily and initially caused frustration. Tip: Put the border (interlocking) pieces together first and then fill in the states (non-interlocking pieces). We enjoy driving across America with little cars and learning about the states. I wouldn't recommend this puzzle for independent use for younger children. Highly recommend the puzzle to be completed with adult for tons of fun and learning.
4,US Map,"This map is a great educational tool for my 4 year old and MYSELF!! I love the fact that it lists each states capital and what the state is known for in a little picture on each puzzle piece. I am disappointed in the fact that the puzzle does not snap together like a traditional puzzle b/c every time my 4 year old places a puzzle piece in, the whole thing shifts and I have to realign it before we can continue, which is frustrating. Also the actual puzzle pieces are thin, so I don't know how long this will last with a preschooler in the house. Overall, though, I would purchase it again."
5,Great puzzle to utliize many skills,I bought this for my 3 year old son who enjoys doing puzzles. This puzzle is very educational and great with building different skills such as recognizing pictures and puzzle shapes and help with motor skills in putting the puzzle together. Melissa and Doug puzzles are larger and more durable than most puzzles. This is definitely worth buying.
5,Great for challenging gifted younger children.,My daughter was in 1st grade when she received this as a gift. She is in gifted classes at a school that does not start Social Studies until third grade so this was a wonderful supplement to keep her challenged but does not interfere with what she is learning at school.
3,darla,I thought this was one of the puzzles that was triple the size. It is just a large puzzle. I was disappointed when I received it.
3,State Shapes Matter!,"My three year old just received this puzzle for Christmas. He loves puzzles and put this one together with the same enthusiasm as any with Spiderman or dinosaurs pictured. We enjoyed telling him where family members lived (as we have a geographically rich extended family). My wife and I are excited about the opportunity to teach him about geography and the United States more broadly.The biggest con of the puzzle are the state shapes. For their part, Melissa and Doug got the larger states right. Most would be recognizable isolated from this map. Some however, including our West Virginia are not. What is the worst part about this slight is that West Virginia is not a solitary piece (it is attached to other states as well). The funny panhandles are drawn on (or not drawn on, more precisely), not overlooked because of cutting concerns. While this map gives our son a good sense of direction and space, we'll have to look elsewhere for the real thing."
4,Love the Melissa and Doug Floor Puzzle,"I have bought about five of these Melissa and Doug Floor Puzzle. They are huge, fun and inexpensive. We have one about dinosuars, the ocean, this map, and the solar system. I love encouraging my children to learn, and try my best to make it fun to learn too."
3,Not exactly geographically correct,"I bought this for my 4 year old, we had fun putting it together and it was useful for me to help him understand that our country is broken up into states and the general layout. But this is not very geographically correct, the proportion of Alaska is way off - it's our largest state and doesn't look even close. Then Hawaii is proportionally too big. And the upper peninsula of Michigan is not the same color as the rest of the state. I am not a geography expert so I have a feeling there are other inaccuracies. And as far as constructing, there should be an instruction to assemble the blue border first so the pieces are held in place. Overall it's okay but I would not recommend this a friend."
3,It's alright...,"I got this puzzle for my 3 year old daughter who LOVES puzzles, and is pretty good at them. I love Melissa and Doug products, and I like that this is a large puzzle, that it's durable, and brightly colored. The problem with this puzzle is that the pieces do not interlock... While I like that MOST of the pieces are state-shaped, there are others that are not... like New England because I guess the pieces would be too small... but when you have a child trying to put the puzzle together, it would help if the pieces stayed put once they were put in place- there's a lot of ""fixing"" the puzzle so the next piece will fit in properly. I guess it would be helpful if the real states were shaped like puzzle pieces instead of squares ;)Pro: State Shapes, Durable, BrightCon: Comes apart easily"
5,GREAT PUZZLE,My 3 1/2 year old can put together the outer edges of the puzzle and then we work together with the states. Knock it out in about 30 minutes and do it all over again. I can't tell you how many times I've done this puzzle with my kids. This is child #3 and it is still a winner in our house.
5,This is a great learning tool,"My husband and I bought this puzzle for my 2.5 year old for Christmas. After a few times of helping her put the puzzle together she now can do it by herself. I agree with other reviews about having them cut on state lines, it's a great learning tool! My daughter ( who is not even three yet) knows all the states and it working on learning the capitals. We point out where all our family lives and what states we have to go through to visit them. She can put it together and take it apart time after time, and after many times of doing this it still is in great shape. I would recommend this toy to anyone who wants a fun way to teach their little ones about the U.S."
1,Disappointed,"Just like the earlier reviewer, I too was disappointed in this product and will no longer buy Melissa and Doug products. I bought a few different products recently and the quality has deteriorated. Besides, it's made in China....and I would like to purchase a US made map of our country. The pieces aren't correctly shaped, don't fit or stay in place...all in all, a disappointment. There was a time when I was impressed with Melissa and Doug products....not any longer."
1,From Door County Wisconsin!!!!,"I have bought Melissa and Dougs Puzzles For over 5 years now, and I must say this was the last thing I expected!!!! The pieces do not stay together AT ALL!!! and the craftsman ship is severly sub-par!!! I am from door county WI and thumb of Wisconsin (which is the most identifyable part of our little state) has been completely removed from the puzzle!!! How am I supposed to show my children where we live in the United States??? NOT EDUCATIONAL OR WORTH THE MONEY!!!I will continue to by from this company, but only the wooden puzzles!!!"
2,disappointed teacher,"This puzzle had too many states joined together. I expected some of the smaller states, like the New England states to be joined, but not so many. For example, Wisconsin, Michigan, and the Great Lakes are all one piece. I purchased 2 of these puzzles to use with my 7th grade class. The students need to learn all 50 states and their locations on a map. I was going to glue magnets onto the backs of the pieces. Then I planned to divide the class in 2 and have relay races to see which team could complete their map the fastest. I am returning both puzzles. This item would be better for much younger children."
2,Not interlocking,"The pieces don't interlock... might be okay for an older child, but my 3 year old was frustrated."
3,American Puzzle,The puzzle is nice because it is educational and my children are able to learn about the states and a famous thing about each state but the puzzle itself is hard to put together because it shifts so easily. Because the pieces aren't somehow interlocking they move as you are trying to put new pieces in and that was very frustrating for my children.
4,Melissa & Doug USA Map,"I bought it as a 6th birthday gift for my grandson although it was of more interest to his three and a half year old sister who is into floor puzzles. The addition of pictures on each states helped my granddaughter put the pieces together and her brother listened, too, as she said them out loud. She can't read yet but she recognized most of the pictures by herself. Then I asked them how many states there were and a discussion ensued on geography in general. This was my intention."
1,NOT TRUE !!,"a lot of thing the writer said about kuwait is not true for every reader information we have 22 churchs in kuwait , it is not a holy war against religious and political freedom , we have religious and political freedom"
1,weak story ....the goal was to attack Islam!,"I regret after I read this book, it is not even worth the time I spent on it. it was obvious why this book was written, he attackes Islam as a relgion and not the democratic status in Kewait. I think the book by itself doesn't carry any valuable meanings."
1,This book is a fraud,"My name is annie and my mother is Julie. The same Julie that is in this book. Robert and her were married for about three years. and he abandoned her and their baby. This book if full of lies and crap. Robert used my mom to get out of kuwait and get access to the USA. He is a theif and a liar. I am asking all of you who want to read this book to think twice. He hurt my family and with you reading this book, you are no better."
1,this book is full of lies,"i have read this book , i was shocked becouse i know the Auther`s brother and family , this kept switching back and forth , first he was a not beliver in GOD at all , then he became a christian , then he switched back to Islam , finally he became a christian ,,, so i think this guy is looking for mony and how to be famouse ."
1,this book is a complete difinition of propaganda,"this auther live in the same region where i live back home in kuwait, first he became a ""not beliver in GOD"" , then he switch to christianity , then he switch back to islam ,no he is christian again, i think a guy like him who switch 4 times in 2 years , really seek some help, but not everything in the book is true , kuwait gov. DID not take his family busniss nither his life , he lived a normal life like others, so who ever buy this book just keep in mind that IN KUWAIT EVER ONE HAVE THE SAME RIGHT AS OTHERS NO MATER WHAT RELIGION YOU BELIVE IN."
2,item ; Elisa Au Secrets of championship Karate DVD / contioning,it is a short and Really disapointing movie. In top of that the sound is really bad. I am not going to recommand it. I paid total of 22.77 which is a lot for a short movie even with sport advises.
4,Well-intentioned but incomplete compilation,"That fact that you're even reading this review suggests you're one of the lucky few folks who discovered this awesomely underrated trio in the late 80's/early 90's. Combining infectious pop/punk hooks with a surprising lyrical depth, Material Issue put out three excellent albums during their brief career (a fourth disc,Telecommando Americano, was released in 1997 after lead singer Jim Ellison's death). What this Millenium Collection offers is a sampling of their catalogue: 4 tracks from each of their first two releases, 2 from the third disc, one from the posthumous release, and a previously-unreleased live cover of Sweet's ""Ballroom Blitz.""If you're never heard them--and there's a good chance you haven't--this is certainly a fine place to start. But if you can get your hands on all their albums (some of which are long out-of-print), they're all worth owning."
1,Another appalling work by Strydom,"We all wish that Strydom would become more clear about the points he wishes to make,and then find suitable terms to express them. Instead he tries to show off his vocabulary and obfuscate so as to hide the fact that he has nothing to say and do not understand the subject matter"
4,Good Introduction to Sex Industry,"What is really terrific about this book is the fact that it incorporates so many different voices, giving varying perspectives on the question. Too often people know about one aspect of the sex industry and make assumptions that they understand everything that there is to understand about it; this book gives enough perspectives to discourage -- though obviously not eliminate -- that assumption.At times funny and smart, casual and intense, the voices here will make sex work approachable and understandable to those who are just thinking about it, either as potential clients or potential workers, and provide valuable insights into the culture and ethos of the business before faux pas can be made. For those who are just curious, it's an excellent introduction to *some* of the people who live in this world.--- Jeannette Angell, author of CALLGIRL"
3,Things guys really need to know,"Thank goodness something like this has come along. It's not all Pretty wome=an out there ya know. Things can get nasty. I just read ""The Call Girl Actress""...Confessions of a Lesbian Escort by Erica Black and boy did I get an eye opener to the industry and what the ladies have to go through. This book is a ""must read"" for any man thinking of visiting a sex worker"
2,not what the book seems to be,"I was looking for insight into the experiences of men. When a book includes the term ""Guide"" in its title, you assume it is going to give you useful information. But this book is just a collection of essays by sex workers. Some of them are still interesting, some of them are not written well, and some feel put on and not honest at all. The essays that include advice pretty much amount to be clean, smell nice, be polite, and tip well. Now you don't have to buy the book."
5,Countering the Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys Vol. III,This is a very informative and helpful book. I have learned a lot and seriously recommend that everyone read it!
4,Countering the conspiracy to destroy black boys volume 3,I love the theory in the book. As a society we are all responsible for our children. I appreciate him writing about this subject.
5,HILARIOUS,I'm an avid reader (usually of work a bit more serious) and I found this to be the MOST hysterical book that I've ever read! I happened upon it in a condo I was renting in Mexico and picked it up due to it's intriguing title. After a few pages I was hooked and read this book faster than any other I've read in my entire life. It's a must read and re-read!
3,A good book for beach reading,"Sex Toys of the Gods is a nice, light book. The humor and entertaining cherades of the characters make up for the lack of intellectual content. Christian McLaughlin's book is perfect for summer reading -- it's a great book to take to the beach."
4,I read it TWICE,"Call it fluff, call it shallow, call it what you like but this highly entertaining and absolutely hilarious novel will rank as one of my all-time favorites. As a product of the 80s, I could almost HEAR the music McLaughlin was writing about. I could imagine the soundtrack and the wardrobes and, well, it was just flat-out fun and funny. I did it in reverse - read ""Sex Toys"" and then read ""Glamourpuss"". Loved them both and like all my fellow reviewers, I'll be at the front of the line for McLaughlin's next novel!!Might I recommend to those who love Mr. McLaughlin's work...Greg Johnson wrote a book called ""Pagan Babies"" that has also become another of those read and re-read favorites among my collection. Give it a try."
1,A waste of time.,I read maybe 20 pages into this book and realized I couldn't care less what happened to the characters. At that point I saw no reason to waste my time finishing it. Maybe you have to live in L.A.?
2,Much better than 1602,"The only thing of Neil Gaiman's I had tried to read before this was 1602. I say tried to read because I found it so dull that I never finished it. Now I must tell you that when it comes to fantasy type stories I have never much cared for them but I thought this collection was not half bad. Granted as the inspiration for DC's Vertigo line its far more violent and vulgar than I care for but it's obvious Mr. Gaiman put a lot of effort into crafting these stories and he deserves to get credit for that. The art in these stories could have been so much better though. I know they wanted a moody supernatural feel for the stories but there must have been any number of artists who could pull that off while at the same time giving the stories some impressive visuals as well. I only gave this three stars because of reasons I stated above, but if this is the kind of stuff you crave then you might really enjoy this."
4,1st digital comic,This was the first digital comic I've read and it was very intriguing. The digital medium didn't detract from the art and the story was quite addicting to read. Can't wait to read the rest.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION,"The book itself was fantastically written, and a super credit to it's genre however the retouching uses an extremely contrasting use of gradients and the colors mix so poorly that it is eye-straining to even look at. It is okay if you want a decent copy that you don't mind getting torn to hell, but other than that it is and ugly and unfair way to read an otherwise beautiful series. You'd be better off buying the original 20 first print online they are far better looking and more enjoyable"
4,TRIPPY,Even Neil Gaiman proclaims that this is his clumsiest and least favorite of all of the sandman titles. In that case this has to be the greatest series of all time because i thought the first volume was amazing. What lost it a star was it was a bit anti-climactic in places and the showdown with doctor destiny didn't live up to my expectations. But this book will forever change how you sleep. Some find this book a little weird and rightfully so. But aren't our dreams trippy and crazy? This book is like nothing else I have ever read or experienced. I recommend it to everyone who is ready for a huge departure from your everyday superhero comic.
5,The start of a wonderful trip...,"This is the first trade paperback of the Sandman series. It's well written, well drawn, and as soon as you begin you'll be hearing Dream's dark dark voice inside your head. It's the kind of voice you can swear you can hear, for just a second, and then it's gone. Not many comics can be so real. The use of mythology, psychology, and history blend perfectly to create the most fantastic world. I read this comic in one sitting and it was painful to come to the last page - I just didn't want it to ever end! You'll feel the same way."
4,ok,served the purposeCame relatively quickly and worked great for class would recommend purchasing books again always looking for cheap books for school mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
3,Sandman Vol 1,"I'm new to the Sandman story and I found this book interesting but not really that great. I felt that it was a bit underdone. That being said, I will continue to read the series and look forward to getting my hands on book no 2"
3,UPDATED: Unable to send sample for Kindle for iPad version 3.0.1,"Update: Amazon updated today the Kindle apps, and this and many other comics are now available for the iPad. The resolution is not retina quality as some competitors, but it is very enjoyable. Keep it up, Amazon! I would rate it 5 stars if the resolution was Retina quality. As it is, it can be improved. I hope to be able to edit this review a third time to upgrade it for 5 stars!Old entry:Current Kindle version on App Store is v3.0.1, which is the version installed on my iPad (new iPad).Unfortunately, the page for this product is saying that it cannot send the sample because my iPad's Kindle app should be upgraded. There is no newer version than the one installed on my iPad, so this is bogus.The new iPad makes for a fantastic media for comics. Sandman is a favorite for Comic fans. You are losing money, wake up."
2,I have heard so much...,I needed to see what the hubbub was about. I was not engaged by this first entry in a praised series. The story was disjointed. The reader a mere observer. Why would one care about this character? I need a reason to go on.
1,Can't download to IPad Kindle App,I am upset that I cannot download this to my old Kindle or to my IPad or to my IPhone Kindle Apps. Amazon and Gaiman just lost some business.
1,Not available for iPad,"The poor rating is not for content, rather that it is limited for just the Kindle Fire and android devices. I have an iPad 3, and use my Kindle app for all my books. This really ticks me off. You lose this sale, Amazon."
2,I really cant get the graphic style of american comics...,"I bought this one because i've read one Gaiman before (American Gods) and i though it was fabulous...I only had been exposed to american comics before only through some old, translated, x-men comics which i figured where for kids. I was expecting a much higher quality for the graphics.The storys good, but i'd rather read a book if the visual are not the main attraction in a comic. I also bought neverwhere at the same time, and still think that Gaiman is a great author."
