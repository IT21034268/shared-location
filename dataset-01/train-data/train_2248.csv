5,Great Intro to Jazz,For those just getting into Jazz or just need a refresher course this is a great CD. I brought it for my husband who is a big Jazz fan and he just loves it and gets alot of use out of them.
3,Piano Man,"The list of jazz giants missing from Burns' CD set is endless, yet multiple cuts from others abound (Armstrong has 8 alone). Among the missing: Teddy Wilson, Charlie Christian, Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson, Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, Anita O'Day, Zoot Sims, Erroll Garner, Fats Waller, Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins , Lionel Hampton to name a few. Burns obviously has a bias that prevented him from presenting a full true picture of this wonderful art. Opportunity missed!"
2,Maybe for someone who knows nothing about jazz,"As a seasoned jazz listener, this is a fairly disappointing boxed set. It vastly overemphasizes the early decades, big-band, and dance music to the exclusion of the more core group-improvisatory material. The discs run in roughly chronological order and it takes until the last disc to get out of the sixties!If you are feeling nostalgic for the music of the 20s, 30s and 40s, or know nothing about jazz and want to start somewhere, I guess this isn't terrible..many of these recordings are perfectly fine and the musicians perfectly respectable. If you're thinking of getting this for someone who actually knows something about jazz, do them a favor and avoid this. They'd be much better off with 2-3 cd's that came out in the last year than a smattering of backfill that probably substantially overlaps cd's they bought years ago because they thought they should have some of X but never listened to more than once or twice."
2,It smells a little funny here,"There is a lot of great music/artists here, but a lot of great music is missing and a lot of artists are too heavily favored.I don't like it when a group of writers try to shape the minds of a unknowing public. I think Kenny should stay away from the ARTS and stick with war and sports."
4,"A wonderful introduction to jazz, with a few provisos....","This is a wonderful 5-disc set of the history of jazz music. In fact, I listened to it all in one sitting, and I can say as an introduction for those uninitiated in the ways of jazz, this is a superb collection. However, it is by no means thorough. I suppose you might expect this from an introduction, but I was somewhat surprised to see its extensive inclusion of Ellington, Davis and especially Armstrong at the expense of some rather less well known artists. Alloting to the great Django Reinhardt a single track seems a crime. Even so, it's a good listen. As my dear friend says, a true jazz afficianado is never satisfied."
2,"Too much, too little","Contrary to what some reviewers have stated, this is not a good place for someone wanting to get into jazz. This is mainly because this set costs too much for that. Also, there's over-whelmingly too much Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday and Dizzie Gillespie tracks here and little else. You would think that with a 5 disc box set, that Ken Burns could have come up with even little known but great jazz artists to include in this collection aside from adding a few more of the wider known ones as well. I am not a ""jazz snob"" and I feel it's unfair to some of the newer, more contemporary artists to be ignored as well - the rock equivalent of that would be refusing to acknowledge the talent of Jack White simply because he doesn't play like Clapton or Hendrix."
2,The history of jazz acc. to Marsalis,"Ken Burns' Jazz is a misnomer...it's a jazz history done to accomodate Wynton Marsalis' agenda. The agenda amounts to denigrating the accomplishments of white musicians, calling all fusion junk, and promoting Wynton."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary on PBS, but this collection leaves much to be desired."
5,Totally disgusting,"Totally disgusting is about a cat named Mewkiss, a dog named Barkus, and another cat named Allergies. Mewkiss is afraid of rats until Allergies tells her a story about a cat named Mukiz. That builds up her courage to go find them. they go on many adventures and you'll have to read this book to find out about it.I would recommend this book because it has good details and is a good adventure book. I like llamas."
4,"Better than it appears online, sleek!","I have owned this watch for about 5+ years now.Difficult to discern in photo, the face has a very dark vertical striped pattern.Best feature of this watch is clearly the vibrating alarm, works like a charm.Easy to use. Switch to 15 trilling beeps instead of vibrate, if desired.The least agreeable feature might be the band, which if you are clumsy would potentially be prone to scratches on clasp side. (Polished or super smooth areas might scratch)Do not buy if you are fond of incredibly large watches.Excellent timepiece, great quality. Crisp, classy, sleek and mint."
5,"The best ""learn to speak Spanish"" tapes ever!","Very easy to follow, clear pronunciations with backup in text. Gradual increase from words to sentences to a conversational level of speaking."
4,Nice,"It was a hit with my kids. The costume overall fit great on my kids, they are 4 but on the petite side. I had to sewed the armors a bit, they were big on the tiny arms. The only down side is one edge of the mask is not very smooth. Thumbs up overall."
4,Happy little girl,"My daughter loved this costume but the black suit left some black on her clothes. She wore clothes underneath it for Halloween and when we returned there was black on the clothing. As I recall, the black did come off her clothes in the wash, but was not happy to see that at first because I did not expect that to happen."
5,Loved it!,My daughter looked adorable in this! We live in Hawaii so this was nice and cool unlike alot of other costumes. She liked the mask too and wore it all night.
3,I'M REPEATING MYSELF BUT...,"I can't beleive someone can think of resuming MILES in 1 cd.This is simply dumb,dumb,dumb and it reduces a great musician to a few samples.Like COLTRANE, MILES had a multi level career,each one advancing his taste for reaching new steps everytime.The MILES DAVIS QUINTET with JOHN COLTRANE has possibly become the greatest jazz band ever.The box collecting their works is marvellous.Why not buy ROUND MIDNIGHT and SKETCHES OF SPAIN and if you like them, you can go from there?CIVIL WAR:GREAT;BASEBALL:GREAT;JAZZ:READ A GOOD BOOK INSTEAD"
3,An uneccesary sampler,"Why buy this album, when you can get the newly remastered originals? This albums takes the tunes out of their original context and delivers substandard versions. And to what end, other than putting a few bucks in Ken Burns' pocket?If you're a newcomer interested in Miles, go buy the newly remastered versions of ""Kind of Blue"", ""Birth of the Cool"" and ""Sketches of Spain""."
3,Like standing next to a mountain,"There is just simply too much brilliant Miles Davis out there to narrow it down to 1 cd. These things can be done for most other artists; for Davis however, it is quite impossible. This cd represents a good (if thin) slice of Miles, but for the true devotee of jazz.... forget it. You'll want to check out some of the master's cd's for themselves, before electric and after."
1,Break and flake easily,"These crayons are washable and rich in color but they break easily. My 2 year old daughter has broken each one with just regular use...not pressing too hard or throwing, etc...just with simple scribbling. Plus these flake, leaving small particles everywhere. Would not purchase again."
2,Regular crayons are better,"These crayons break, flake, and color too easily. Regular crayons wouldn't color on clothes as readily. These color on my daughters clothes with a very light touch. It says that they are washable, but they didn't wash out of my daughter's clothes. I was disappointed in them."
5,the crayons are great,"I love crayola! even other brands like lakeshore are not as washable as crayons products are. trust me I know cause I've cleaned Walls and tables from crayons and markers! I am now trying art (something) only because it's cheaper and I need lots of them now, but if I had the money I would definately get more of these"
2,Poor for classroom use,"I'm a teacher who frequently has students work in groups writing on a whiteboard together, and wanted to find a cheaper and greener alternative to whiteboard markers. These markers aren't it. The writing is too pale to be read easily from halfway across a classroom, and you REALLY have to rub hard to erase the writing completely. After one session, the kids all wanted to go back to whiteboard markers."
5,Great Product,"I do not notice any difference between this solution compared to conventional tested on animals solution. I am happy I can clean, store and disinfect my contacts without hurting animals!"
2,Save your money,"Whatever you do... do NOT buy QUIETUS either. THE COMPANY ""PREVAL"" IS A RIP OFF! SAVE YOUR MONEY for this product. It is probably just a ""sugar pill"" but you can bet it won't work! The worse part will be when you call for an RMA # to return it. First they will try and string you out past your 30 day guarantee period. Telling you you need to take it for that length of time. Then they will offer you a 50% refund of your purchase price or tell you you'll have to wait up to 60 days for a refund. They you have to pay to ship it back with tracking. Stay away from this rip off company. I will let XM advertising know they should drop them."
5,Works for me,"I have Meniers Syndrome and this Product helps my Tinnitus. I believe that it works because I also have a low sodium diet, and I now exercise and take other supplements as well.This is NOT a cure all, but part of the regimine for health. If you are willing to use it as a PART of your cure for tinnitus, buy it. If you are looking for a wonder cure. best not too."
1,There's no cure for tinnitus,"I took RingStop (3 orders) before I went to the EENT specialist. Not only did RingStop not help at all to relieve my tinnitus, but my visit to the doctor (and subsequent internet research) confirmed that there is no cure for this condition. Perhaps in five or six years it will abate somewhat. So don't spend your money onRingStop -- it's no cure."
3,Ring Stop from Amazon,"I've been taking Ring Stop for almost 3 months as a supplement.It seems sometimes are better than others, I continue to havebuzzing in ears at intervals, overall less prevalent. I am beingpatient and taking other healthy precautions to protect my hearing.The instructional pamphlet included is a very good educationalpiece for awareness of hearing care."
1,Useless product,"Went through two bottles, taking exactly as directed. No relief what-so-ever, not even a hint. Would give it zero stars if that was an option."
5,Works for me.,"From reading other reviews, it seems that this product doesn't work for everyone. But it works for me. It took a little while and then it first reduced the problem and then the problem stopped. From time to time, it comes back. When it does, I take Ringstop and it goes away again. I use both the pills and the drops."
1,Ring Stop - got worse quickly!,"I've had constant ringing in my ears for years. After taking Ring stop pills with Ring stop ear drops for three weeks, the ringing is much worse. Deeply regret trying this product."
1,BAD REACTION?,"Did anyone else have a bad reaction to this product?I took my first 2 capsules yesterday morning and a little while later my chest felt like it had a tight band around it--regular movement of arms and deep breaths hurt. The pain wasn't as strong by the evening so I took 2 more to see if the pills might be the cause. The pain increased and my chest cavity hurt to move around in bed.I am a bit concerned because I wondered if I was having a heart attack.I am not on any medication and have not even taken any headache pain meds recently.I looked on the internet and can't find anything about bad reactions to this product.Could any of the secondary ingredients in this product have caused this reaction?I didn't take any pills today and am almost back to normal.I guess if the pills kill me, I won't hear the ringing in my ears anymore. ;-)"
3,Ringing/Buzzing in Left Ear,I'm in my second week of use at one-half of the recommended dose. The level of noise in my left ear has decreased by about 75% to a point where the noise is not bothering me.
1,Complete total rip-off!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Why give your money to these hucksters? This stuff has no clinical trials and nothing to back it except the listing on Amazon - and Amazon should remove the listing! What's in this stuff and why is it there? Who knows? It did nothing for me except lighten my wallet. Desperation for relief can make people pay anything for the most useless crap, and believe me this stuff is crap. Hold on to your money and have a talk with a good Ear, Nose and Throat doctor."
1,Not for kids who might be scared,"Although this book gives a good chronology of what happens at the dentist, I found it cold and distant. Neither child's feelings are addressed. I was expecting a book that might describe how funny it feels to have someone poking around in your mouth, what the mouthwash tastes like or how wierd it is to go so far back in the chair. And there is absolutely no mention that either child might be nervous or scared. Instead it's just a list of statements. The older child needs a filling. Come on, HOW SCARY IS THAT? And yet the kid doesn't even blink.This book is neither personal nor engaging.If I had known it was like this I wouldn't have bought it."
5,This is CD is a must have!,"This band is an awsome group! This is there best album! The best songs in my opinion are:TonyMachine gun songPunk BeatKill the radioYou MUST get this CD!P.S:Audio CD (December 27, 2005)December 27 is my birthday!"
5,Kit's Story Collection American Girl,"The book is beautifully bound, with gilt edging. It is a gift for my nine year old granddaughter, and I know that she will feel that it is as beautiful as I do. The stories are well written, and I know that she will truly enjoy this for years to come. I would recommend this book to any fans (or grannies of fans) of American Girl Dolls and books."
5,book,My daughter just loves american girl books and i would recomend these books my little girl is reading more sence she got these books.
3,A cute sequel with a pretty setting,"Papi teaches the children, but their mother works in PR at the hotel. Their inquisitive and adventurous daughter helps to solve a mystery. Not as good as BHC 1 but fun."
2,More of the same,The movie is ok but there's nothing new here. Time to move on. The dogs are ok but the human actors look bored.
3,Good Dog!,I love the spunkyness if these little pooches. The plot is easy for children to follow and I liked the ending of the film. It was very intertaining. THank you.
2,DVD didn't work properly,The item arrived in time in the original packaging. But the DVD didn't work properly. It started pixelating after couple of minutes and then froze.
1,"too, too silly","I actually liked the first two in the series and was willing to really be silly to appreciate the dogs, but this time they went too far into fatuousness."
1,Shudder,"I don't think there are words in the English language to describe how bad I found this movie. I was into expecting greatness mind you. I would have accepted it just being funny or at least somewhat humorous and I found it to be neither. The first movie was good-ish at least, it was certain,y better than this version. Save your sanity and watch the first one only!"
5,Viva la Chihuahua,A great movie to watch with your family!! The BHC franchise is a great watch all around. Would definitely reccommend.
2,"OK, BUT",As a followup of the First in the series it was less than I had hoped for. If a Number four is made it will not be on my Wish list.
3,cute family movie,this was cute i like family movies i watched with my 4 year old granddaughter it caught her attention but didnt keep it for long i may watch agian someday because my attention was diverted
1,Awful,"BHC1 was pretty good. BHC2 was bearable. This was downright awful-I think we laughed twice. The different doggie bands were funny, but that was it for this dog of a movie."
1,VERY POOR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A MALE DOG THAT HAS BEEN NEWTERED CAN ""NOT"" FATHER ANY PUPPIES , EVEN ACCIDENTLY , IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN ! ! ! ! ! NORE IT NEVER WILL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""DISNEY PICTURES NEEDS TO WAKE UP AM SMELL THE COFFEE BREWING . IN THE FIRST BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA MOVIE . IT WAS THE MOST ASSININE MOVIE THEY EVER PUT OUT , A MUTT CHIHUAHUA MIX ""NEUTERED"" CLAIMING TO WANT TO START A FAMILY WITH A FEMALE CHIHUAHUA PUREBRED AND THE NEXT SEQUAL , THEY ARE MARRIED AND HAVE A VERITY OF MIXED UP LOOKING CHIHUAHUA PUPPIES AND THIS MALE DOG HAD BEEN NEWTERED................."
3,Movie REview,It was ok not as good as the other two movies were. It just wasnt as entertaining as i thought it would be.
2,Not nearly as good as the other Beverly Hills Chihuahua movies,Ordered this for my daughter who loved the original Beverly Hills Chihuahua movie. This one was okay - but not nearly as good as the original and even Part 2. Actors were different and the story line was just not good. My daughter did not want to watch it again and usually she will watch movies over and over. It would make a cute rental if you just want to watch it one time. But don't waste your money purchasing the DVD.
4,Daughter Loved it,My daughter really enjoyed watching this movie. She has a Chihuahua so I'm sure that makes her a little partial.
3,Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3,enjoy movie for the whole family. very funny.This movie for the people have dog or pet who love them and care of them.
2,Does it really matter whether it's a bad movie?,Your children will want to watch it anyway. It's the only chihuahua movie I've seen but it's probably not the last.
4,Very Enjoyable,"Love to watch his hands tickle the ivories. Such a gift, and he makes it look like fun! A testimony to God."
4,An excellent collection of Barber Shop tunes,This book met my needs and i recommend it. The songs are easy harmony for male voices.
4,"Adorable, but hangs crooked","I love this mobile, it goes great with the Winnie set I bought but I have one problem. The mobile stuffed animals are not well balanced. The toys each weigh differently, so the mobile is crooked. We tried to balance the heaviest toys but it did not make enough of a difference. If you do get the Peek a Pooh set though, I would still recommend this mobile."
3,It's good but,"We decorated our baby room in Winnie the Pooh style, so we bought this mobile as well. It's very convinient, it has a switch to turn off the sound, but I will give it a 3 anyway, because Tigger's tail was always catching the stand (stopping mobile rotation) so I had to tie it in a knot, and also because the winding spring broke after 6 month of almost every day use, although it was supposed to last 18 month."
4,A clever caper of whodunit,"Merry Kramer is a feisty reporter not afraid of an assignment - even if it includes chasing down the person who put a dead man's body in the trunk of her car.Roper delivers a spirited heroine who is confident yet sometimes questions herself. With Merry Kramer, she has created a likeable, good-head-on-her-shoulders character and has numerous possibilities of whodunit in this story.If you like mystery, intrigue, and suspense with a bit of romance, you'll want to read the three book series."
1,Shipping stinks,"Thirty plus days to ship a CD from the UK to Alabama? What up with that? I thought Airborne used planes, not sailing ships. Ordered 12/07/10, shipping notification on 12/09/2010, and still not received on 1/09/2011? Be careful when you order something outside the US, it takes forever. This was a Christmas gift for 2010, but loks like it will be for 2011."
2,Better than nothing?,"Purchased this for a 1992 Mercedes 500SL. It picks up all of the stations some of the time, but can not hold them for long. We live about 20 miles from NYC so signal strength not an issue. I listen to the IPOD anyway, but my wife likes radio so its a problem. The installer said it might be the windshield being coated,but our EZ Pass works just fine. I do not think I would buy this again."
3,"It's OK, picks up some stations fine","This antenna is very picky where it is placed, it's fairly bulky so it's not too easy to place. It would pick up great mounted on the outside of the car, but would not hold up to weather. Under my dash it was nothing but static, the cord is just long enough to get above your visors where reception is OK, get 75% more channels now, but only a quarter of those are crystal clear. For 15 bucks what do you expect though?"
1,Does not work,"I connected it according to instructions and reception is horrible, like the radio doesn't even have an antenna. Hooking it up to power actually makes it worse. Save your money."
3,Works Well.,The items are great. I ordered two twin packs and one of the four was defective but the company is taking care of it. Like them a lot.
1,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled as I was. This is not a book but a 30 page advertisement for the Dalton Gang Hideout in Meade Kansas with a short story about the Dalton's sister, her husband, and a few pages of Dalton genealogy thrown in. Some Meade Kansas information unrelated to the Dalton's. Cover price is $3.50 and feel the Dalton Gang Hideout and Meade Ks Chamber of Commerce should have paid me to purchase and read this."
1,Don't buy if you want to play on iTunes,"I purchased this mammoth and expensive set and was looking forward to playing it on iTunes. For some reason most of the discs when transferred play garbled, as if half the sound was coming out of an old phonograph. I suspect someone was trying to stop copying. No way I'm doing it wrong since I've already directly loaded around a 1,000 CDs this way from all the major, and minor labels. I guess I won't be buying anymore Warner CD's. I'm going to contact them to see what's up and will update post. . . and I'll need lots of luck in getting a refund I'm sure."
5,Try To Put It Down!,"The first few paragraphs of the Foreword by Warren Bennis tip you off that Leadership Presence is an unusual and heady business leadership book.Authors Halpern and Lubar are convincing and clear. Their anecdote-filled guide is profound without being heavy or treacly. Leadership Presence offers meaty chapters and practical exercises that are fun and helpful to readers, suggestive of the benefits to corporate groups who take Ariel Group seminars - and often keep coming back for more.Halpern and Lubar are classy and serious with just enough humor to make this different self-improvement book an exhilarating read. Inspiring, almost like a novel with characters you care about, Leadership Presence is amazing. You won't be able to put it down."
2,Not so hot!,"The Kettler bike is not made for a short person -- if you don't have long legs, do not buy this bike. The lowest point for the seat is too high to reach the peddles comfortably.The bike itself wasn't too difficult to assemble if you can figure out what the pictures are ""saying"" -- no written instructions."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT,"I angrily threw away this useless piece of trash after using it once. I ordered it because it looked nice and sturdy, is made of glass, and had acceptable reviews here on Amazon. The first thing that annoyed me is that this bottle is shaped in a way that you need to hold it with two hands like a cocktail shaker unless you're a giant with huge paws that can reach around it. But you need your second hand anyway to keep the stopper in place, which has precisely zero footing in the bottleneck and falls out at the slightest of tilts, shakes, or moves, leaving a stain of salad dressing wherever it drops. Do not be deceived: This is a pretty-looking but very poorly designed product, and I strongly advise against buying it to save you a lot of frustration."
2,Poor choices,"Having heard the Ellington/Coltrane album, I wanted to hear more of the Duke. Unfortunately, the selections for this CD are of generally very poor sound quality and do not provide the best examples of Ellington's greatness. It is at best a very uneven set. It does not compare to the very good selections on the Rollins, Miles, and Coltrane collections that are part of the same series."
1,buyer beware,These handwarmers are the best I have used but I would not get these for lights and holsters as they are priced per each not as a 30 count box as advertised. I have sent back for a refund but have not yet received. But as far as the handwarmers go they are very good but I would buy somewhere else. mazon had them last year for around $15/30 count box.
1,Poor Tiger,"I have always been a fan of Tiger Flowers. I was intrigued by stories of him as a child. I must say as a social history and/or biography of Flowers this book is a complete flop. I was lucky enough to purchase a rare copy of Flowers biography published in 1928 by Edney and Flowers' widow. The book leaves much to be desired, a contention which Mr. Kaye agrees with. Interestingly, despite this fact Mr. Kaye seems to use the Edney book as his major source for Flowers life. It would have been nice to have had a hometown heros life done in a more concise fashion. Sadly, Flowers legacy seems as neglected today, after the publication of this book, as it was before hand. Poor Tiger."
3,Did the Job,"Despite the horrible reviews on this wig i still ordered it. I received the wig 5 days before the Halloween Party so I had time to work with it. When I took it out of the bag, it was totally flat, looked horrible. So I stretched it over a small lampshade. From there I proceeded to style the hair with my hands - returning it to it's basic shaped. Left it alone for 3 days. then came back and checked on it and it and it was nice and full. The curls lifted to make the perfect Fine Foxy Fro. I recommend this wig for the price. Will take some work but if you take it out of the package several days before wearing, it should work just fine. Also be prepared when you put the wig on. You will need some scissors to cut some bangs so you can see out of it. I also bought a wig cap which i recommend."
1,Dollar Store Item,This thing is pathetic. I tried 2 as I thought the first was defective. It looks like something that you would buy @ the dollar store. You'll get better performance by licking your finger and checking out the wind direction. Stay away from this thing.
1,Would Not Work,I could not get this device to work.Contacted the manufacturer and no response.Perhaps the batteries were duds.Piece of junk. Save your money.
3,Great wifi tool,"Pros: It was inexpensive ($[...]), it comes with its own batteries, it's directional and compact.Cons: It won't indentify encrypted wifi signals.I'm a computer jockey on the weekends. When I stumbled across this little tool it made me snicker because I thought it looked a lot like a cell phone and kinda ""gimmicky"". However, the point of the tool is to identify wifi signal strength... nothing else. And I used it for exactly just that. I did a recent wifi install for a friend and used this tool to validate placement of the wifi pc.I don't know why the other reviewers are so hard on this product. It does what it says it'll do. You have to keep you finger on the button to use it but this way it won't eat through the batteries. If you want something nicer with more features.. spend more than $[...]! :)Great tool - good for anyone that does computer work/troubleshooting."
1,Junk! Should have read the reviews.,"I've used this for a few months. It's junk. It eats batteries, it's flimsy, and it has the worst design for battery replacement I've ever seen. I thought about giving it to someone but I can't think of anyone I dislike that much. So in the trash it goes along with any possibility that I'd ever buy another Hawking product."
3,So-So,"Maybe it's because I'm not into antiques and can't understand why someone would want to spend all their time going through and buying other peoples' junk, but I found the whole premise of a ""picker"" to be silly and boring.As for the story, I did find the whole thing somewhat confusing with all the saloonkeepers and various characters. It was an easy late-summer read...although I really don't think I'll be continuing with the series."
5,"o/~ I got time for One More Round, and ...",".a Six Pack to go! o/~Jane Wheel, Kankakee saloon owners' daughter, former ad exec, Charley's estranged wife and Nick's momma, now antique ""picker,"" sentimental ""junquer,"" and ameuteur sleuth, bought a whole room full of old bar Stuff at a going-to-the-assisted-living-home sale. Included in the Dead Guy's (former Chicago tavern owner Oscar Bateman's) Stuff was a grusome discovery which gives new meaning to the phrase ""giving one the finger."" Jane has bought herself another bushel of trouble in this second installment of Sharon Fiffer's fun and witty ""Stuff"" series.

Is it true, what she says, that ""the jadite is always greener on the other side?"" It's MIB: mint in book!TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer, former patron, Peg's Tavern, Hinckley, IL."
3,I got mine autographed!,"This is a straight forward reissue of Soupy's 1966 album. It's totally a no frills job. The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. It sounds like they just copied a mono copy of the album onto a CD. They also didn't add any bonus tracks, or new liner notes. As for the contents of the album, this wasn't one of Soupy's best albums to begin with. Some of his other albums feature him doing sketches and singing songs with the other characters from his show. This album features Soupy by himself, singing his hit song and a bunch of filler material. ""The Mouse"" is a fun song, and so are most of the others, so my complaints aside, it is an enjoyable album if you like this sort of thing. One last thing I had to mention, Soupy messes up the lyrics of ""The Name Game""."
3,"A Good, Fun Album From 1965",I first saw Soupy Sales doing 'The Mouse' on the DVD of Ed Sullivan's Beatles shows. Some of the other songs on this CD are also excellent. There are a couple of tracks made popular by Shirley Ellis ('Name Game' and 'The Nitty Gritty'). Most songs appear nowhere else and are written for Soupy. The best tracks have an R&B; groove. The last songs vary stylistically and are not as good. Own a fun slice of history.Note: This album is extremely short (12 tracks; 28:41).[DW]
1,Very Confused Author,"The writer is confused. He takes opposites and tries to mix them, murder and love, truth and falsehood, religion and atheism. He actually thinks that homicide can be love. He is a very ""religious"" philosopher who wants to use the language of Christianity, which he claims to be powerful yet untrue. He thinks public servants have to lie to us. My impression is that he confuses students."
1,Read this Book to Understand Liberalism in the SBC,"If you really want to know why there was a conservative resurgence in the SBC, read this book. Godsey may be honest but he is not mainstream Southern Baptist. His theology, so far to the left of the average Southern Baptist, caused many Georgia Baptists to reconsider their support for Mercer University when this book was published. The very fact that Godsey has retained his job as president of Mercer University points to the deep rift that still exists among Southern Baptists in the 1990's.Jim Shaver, Pastor First Southern Baptist Church Great Falls, Montana"
2,Hardly a book to interest a person who thinks for himself.,"When we talk about Kirby Godsey, let's be honest. The author has a long way to go to reach someone who has thought beyond the preachments of Southern Baptists and others. I suppose some case could be made for this work to be compared with Tillich's ""The Shaking of the Foundations,"" which didn't shake any foundations to my knowledge, though some found it interesting. Another book from the past comes to mind, ""Your God is too small."" I guess I just don't feel the need of anyone else telling me what God is really like or what the Bible really means or what should be going on in the churches. The rampant confusion on matters religious is well beyond the ability of Dr. Godsey to say anything of any real importance. Godsey's own denomination is one of the better examples of the confusion of which I speak."
5,Your Golf Guide for Life,"Before buying and reading this book, I urge you to read John Toepel's other book ""Golf Can't Be This Simple - The Swing"". Follow the concepts and techniques in these two books and you will probably not want or need to purchase another book on golf instruction. I'm an average golfer and I cannot believe the improvement after a couple of weeks. The book is about developing your swing and your game for life, not a shoppling list of quick fixes."
3,a sometimes-funny painfully-hip action-thriller/political farce,"The unjustifiably neurotic title character in this art scene novel is written in a way that makes him almost likable, and the atmosphere of his subculture is amusingly, if not poignantly, accurate. If you've ever had a three hour conversation about the evolution of irony in a dive bar, you might get a bang out of all the little moments of ""ain't that the way it is!"" and ""hmm, I think I went out with that guy in college,"" but the actual plot gets in the way of enjoying this too much. Plus, tacking a thinly veiled epilogue onto a novel that tries so hard to be self-conscious is way too schmaltzy. That said, I have to admit that this is the only novel I've ever read about art students and other hip young people that hasn't made me want to rip up my art degree, chew and swallow it, regurgitate it onto a canvas, sell it for an ungodly sum, and move to a dude ranch."
2,"This is not a book, this is a laminated double-sided piece","of paper. There are some good tips, but it is not fair to characterize this as a ""full color book.""Also, the ""Boys' Book"" and the ""Girls' Book"" are word for word identical in most places, only a couple of the suggested games are different.If you're just looking for a handy quick tips guide on throwing a kid's party, this would be great for you, but if you're looking for something more comprehensive, move on to another book!"
1,Do not do business with this company!,"I ordered this bench from Amazon through Woodwind & Brasswind. The bench was great - exactly what I was looking for. However, the pad that was shipped was not the right size for the bench. After 4 calls and a total of over two hours on the phone I was finally told that they did not carry a pad that fits this bench! I have not been able to find a pad anywhere else for it and I am in the process of boxing everything up - hoping to get a refund.Update: It has been three months and still no refund. No one in customer service has done what they said they would do and no one has ever offered the slightest apology."
2,Junk,"I bought one of these Musician's Gear adjustable piano benches a couple of years ago, here on amazon. It took about two months for the cheap, pot metal adjustment mechanism under the seat to break. I was not abusing it (for example, I didn't try to adjust it while sitting on it or anything...although really, you should be able to do that). All I did was adjust it up and down now and then, as both me and my then-6 year old play. It just snapped. Pretty much impossible to repair, also, due to the way it's constructed. So for the last couple of years, I've just had a really short piano bench. Nobody uses it. I'll probably screw a piece of wood or two on it in between the framed pad and the main part of the bench, to elevate the pad enough to make it usable. But then it will look crappy. My suggestion would be to avoid this product. Either get one of those X-frame benches ($50 or less), or spring for a decent piano bench (usually well above $200). This one is a waste of time, money and space."
1,Worst ever,"This egg slicer is possibly the worst product I have ever purchased. I attempted to slice a kiwi, and it broke the very first time I used it. What a worthless gadget!"
3,Enjoyable once in a while,"Driving home one night I heard Marian McPartland's fantastic radio show ""Piano Jazz"" and her guest John Stetch. Being a lifelong Monk fan I got home and immediately ordered this CD from Amazon, this was three years ago.When I listen to my Monk compilation on a long drive and a cut from this album comes up it grates on my ears and I usually skip through it. Once in a while I will stop and then listen to several cuts. I do enjoy what John Stetch has done with Monk's music and it's a fun album that I don't regret buying but in general it lives up to the tile of ""exponentially"".Call me old school but given the choice I'll stick with the real thing or a talented cover of his music."
3,History/ Literature/ Lesbian Images,"Doan examines how the Well of Loneliness trial and the appearance of its author Hall helped codify an image of ""lesbian"" for audiences in the late 1920s. The image of the 1920s ""modern"" woman in other British organizations is also examined. Some interesting photos but more academic than other recent books on lesbian images/history."
2,Size is deceiving,"I thought this would be eleven inches in diameter, not in tip to tip length. Do not buy, unless you are looking for a five inch diameter strainer."
1,Read very carefully,The description states 11 inch. But the basket is only about 5 inches. Not nearly the size I was needing. Now I have to deal with returning it.
1,Disappointed,"When they say 11 inches they are not talking about diameter. It looks much bigger than it is. Maybe I was not trained in knowing what I was buying, expected it to be much larger. Paid for more than I would have if I would have know how small it is. The strainer is only a few inches in diameter."
2,Size does matter!,"The size of this item is not diameter, its the length of the handle to the end of the tip on the strainer. the diameter is 3-4 inches. But I guess it would strain rather well?"
4,"4"" Strainer","Other than the description being inaccurate, this is a great strainer. Keep in mind that the basket is about 4 inches and not 11 like the description states."
2,Not good for juice,"One of the obvious drawbacks of shopping online is that you can't see the product first. This strainer is very tightly ""woven"", so you can't strain things like fresh juice very easily because it gets all clogged up."
4,Cuisipro 11-inch,The product is fine. The description is deceiving. The 11 inches is the measure from the end of the handle to the tip used to hang. The width is about 4 1/2 inches wide.
4,Tony Hawk: Professional Skateboarder,"This book arrived in great shape. The skateboarding enthusiast I gave the book to was thrilled with it. The book is geared pretty much for his age-group (16). It is a paperback, but not a very high-end paperback - the paper is inexpensive. But for his purposes, the book is fine. As an avid skateboarder, he was very happy with the photos, biography and chapters about Tony Hawk's moves on a skateboard. I had never heard of this skateboarder (I am a grandmother and not up on skateboarders), but he had and was very happy I picked this book for him. The book arrived within the timeframe given and in plenty of time for Christmas."
1,Superficial and out of Date,"Rather than saving the company, little Billy Ford had to take it over to prove to his infamous family that he could handle it all by himself. Since then, the company has gone down the drain, the product plan is a mess, plants have had to be closed, and the company has had to shed tens of thousands of workers. He drove the company off a cliff and all but ruined everything.Now, fortunately, he is gone - and the more important story is what comes next - if anything - out of the wreck."
5,Outstanding Violonist,"I love finding great jazz violinist. Simply, this is a wonderful CD. I've actually purchased his other CD. The music is lively and makes you want play again and again."
3,An adequate reference book,"I purchased this book last week. I found a few of the sections lacking (I wanted much more information). For instance her section on telecommuting scams only warranted about two pages.I found that the first few chapters of the book was very similar in organization and content to an e-book I purchased about two years ago by another author on the topic of telecommuting, Rosalind Mays -- this was very disturbing.However this author's in-sights on ""office politics"" and the equipment and technical side of telecommuting was very eye-opening and should be carefully considered by anyone wishing to telecommute or work from home in any capacity.It's a good reference for people that ""already"" have a telecommuting job and want to keep it. This is an author I would purchase from again."
1,Not well made,"The lens barrels were not properly registered, leading to double-vision. The magnification and color of each barrel was fine, but the two just didn't line up. I sent them back to Amazon, which was, as always, very easy to work with. I didn't exchange the 'nocs. I'll stick to more expensive ones to be sure I get good quality."
5,Cute and Useful,"This little guy is very compact. I use it for spotting when shooting archery at 18 meters and the pouch fits on my belt. However, I have to strain my eyes a little to see where my arrows land. I wish it was just a little more powerful. Otherwise, it's a great product for the price."
5,I can see!,"I purchased these binoculars for a recent trip overseas. I wanted something lightweight, easy to pack and carry and yet be able to see things at a distance. hands down these were the ticket! They are easy to hold and can see clearly for a decent distance."
3,Nice little binocular,"This binoculars would be rated higher if the eye relief was a bit longer. As it is now, it is a very good small, low cost binoculars."
4,"clear, sharp and surprisingly bright for the size","Quality control is the key in China optics. I picked up a few products before and was surprised at the quality. These are bright for their size, have a wide view, true color and deep contrast, and can focus to high resolution. Small, but they adjust to my eyes OK. Sharper detail than most 'spy binoculars', far less 'haze' than any cheap roof prism binocs. As long as there are good light levels, these are awesome for travel, birds, beach, street signs, and theatre. At this price, no stress to lose them. I may keep two around. No lens caps: just put them in a sandwich baggie, then the pouch. Lens saps are a pain anyhow. Should you step up to the larger Scouts? Dim light or dimming vision would justify getting 22mm units. Carson always exceeds my expectations. One little nit: the focuser was a bit slushy in action, making perfect focus tricky sometimes. After running the focus full range both ways 10 times this got much better."
1,You will see better with your naked eyes. No good even as a 5 yr old toy,"You will see better with your naked eyes. No good even as a 5 year old toy.Instead of 7X magnification, it feel like the objects are 10X farther.Also is soo small, the distance between your eyes is bigger than the distance between the two scopeYou can buy a $2.00 toy, it may serve you better.Don't buy it. You will regret it."
5,Great Product,My son (4 years old) enjoys nature walks so I purchased this for him to observe birds and squirrels among other things. He loves it. I was shocked at how great these work. I plan on buying a set for myself. Perfect alignment. Highly recommend for the price.
4,Ignore Mary Cambell's review.,"It is tragic that Spanish native Mary Campbell grew up with the music of De Falla ""as a background""....Pity that with a little more money she might have been able to sit far enough up in front to hear all the missing notes that this recording has apparently revealed to her at last.She might also have guessed that Shirley Carter (or Shirley Verrett-Carter, as she was then known) was a mezzo-soprano who sang in ""El Amor Brujo"" under Stokowski, and was certainly NOT the pianist who performed in ""Nights in the Gardens of Spain - that job was performed by Philippe Entremont.Desite the shocking musical ignorance displayed by Ms. Campbell in her review, she got one thing right - it is a CD worth buying for some wonderful music, very well played"
4,good sauce,"This sauce is salty. Before you use the sauce, you need to TRY IT YOURSELF. Then when you use it, you are only suppose to use it in SMALL quantities as in SMALL spoonfuls. Add a little bit first, taste the dish and then add more. This isn't a type of sauce that you can just slather on to something. When you stir fry with it, lets say, black bean chicken, add a little bit, taste and then add more.DO NOT ADD ANY ADDITIONAL SOY SAUCE to your dish. Black bean sauce is pretty much black beans, salt, soy sauce and oyster sauce. You do not need to add any additional salt or soy sauce.I bought this sauce because if I'm short on time and I don't have time to soak black beans, this is a good substitute.Just a warning, sampling the sauce itself is essential, but it is so salty that it may make you gag. However, it is delicious when used in CORRECT quanitities and spread over meat.Let me remphasize, SMALL QUANTITIES."
4,"tasty, but only use in small amounts","not really a sauce, more of a flavoring agent._been eating this for years, specifically in dish of cold noodles with peanut sauce and vegetables. We add just a bit, about 1/4 tsp for a large serving. One needs to treat it like a spice rather than a stir-fry-type sauce. It is very strong, salty, and distinctive.I could live without it, but I choose not to. I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $9 shipped for this, when I used to be able to find it at Safeway. No more. Waa."
3,Very good but very salty,"Like almost everyone else here seems to have mentioned before me, this is incredibly salty. I'm glad I gave it a few tries to finally get it right because it is a very good sauce when used in moderation. Anything more than 1 tbsp is probably too much, and that might even be pushing it."
2,Tasty but salty,"I've cooked with this type of sauce twice now. The first time, I had it with low-sodium soy sauce in the dish I made. It turned out painfully salty to the point that we washed the dish in the sink, re-heated it and ate it that way. Even then, you could taste the saltiness.Thinking it was my fault for even adding any type of soy sauce to it, I bought a new jar and tried it alone in the dish. Once more, the saltiness was so overpowering, one couldn't even eat anything without having to rinse the dish off.The tastiness of the black beans and garlic is there, but the saltiness is way too overpowering and is too much to take in."
2,Canned flavor.,"I have used this product for convenience but I should be making my own. The product has a distinct canned aroma, which I believe is the result of processed garlic. I plan to make my own next time though; it's quite easy to find a recipe to make up quickly or even to store in your fridge."
3,Lee Kum Kee,"This is a great seasoning...I knew of the product since i was a kid...As I got my own house and decided to cook, this was first on my list to buy..."
2,Recipes are Heavily MEAT-based,"Beautiful photos. Recipes look great if you eat animals and sugar. NOT based on healthful principles. Also, not much selection of wild foods. There are other books out there on wild foods that are much better. Vegetarians: Don't waste your time. I thought maybe I could substitute ingredients, but the recipes are just too heavily meat-based to make it worthwhile."
4,Fun addition to flying,"This drop module is a fun addition to planes that have an x-port. My daughter loved running after the paratrooper (he is made of rubber)once he ejected from the plane. My only complaint was the amount of time Best Services took to ship the item. It took over 2 weeks for something that should have been 2 or 3 days. Other than that, it is pretty cool and I would recommend it."
3,Great concept but very sensitive,"Learning how to fly the Super Cub. I came across the aerial drop module and thought it would be fun. Programming the transmitter was easy, but the magnet was not strong enough to hold the parachute or missiles in place. Out of the firt 5 tries, only once did it stay on during an easy climb despite me loosening the rubber straps. Great concept but instead of a magnet perhaps a remote latch where the forces of flight won't pop it off."
5,Bombs away!,"This little module adds a whole new dimension to my RC flying experience. I have two boys (3 and 6 year olds) that absolutely love to chase down the bombs and parachute man as I strafe the runway. It functions as stated, and works with a simple electro-magnet. It has been on at least 50 flights and even survived one high-speed nose dive accident (ACT problem). I have never noticed a difference in battery life with or without the unit attached, so the power draw must be very low.Bottom line: I'd buy this aerial drop module again if I ever lost it or broke it in an accident."
2,aerial drop,"the ""man"" falls off of the module before it takes off.. we are disappointed. If there is a better version we would like to know. Or if this is a random failure of the product a replacement would be great."
5,Thank you,"I recieved this Cd yesterday, wow that was real quick, very nice cd, thank you so much hopefully i will be ordering from you again, if you have any cds, etc that i may be looking for, Merry Christmas"
4,A little bit thin,"Nice quality, just a little bit lack of depth (about 1/2""), which can only handle thin-crust pizza."
2,Not so quick and Easy,"I got this hoping that it would fit into my busy lifestyle. Well, there are only a few recipes that are both quick and easy. On top of that I was looking to add tofu to the list of things I eat, not replace every kind of dairy product with a soy product. So, if you have time to go shopping for not so common ingredients, have a liquidizer, and are a vegan, this book would be perfect for you."
2,Kleenix Moist Cloth Hand And Face,"I really like this product and have had increasing difficulty finding it in our local stores. So I was very pleased to to be able to order it online at a very reasonable price. However, the cloths seemed somewhat DRY despite the fact that the individual boxes were new & unopened. The fact that my entire shipment is probably outdated product was further confirmed by the coupons under the seals which EXPIRED OVER A YEAR AGO. Although I will continue to use them, I will not be reordering them from this source."
2,"NOT up to OXO standards, took over 2 mos to arrive","Correct about poor alignment. I've worked with these for a week, cutting shrubs, flowers, simple plants and I can't lock them anymore. The handle is good on the hand, but they don't do the job I expected of Oxo or even a medium brand. They hang up on wet bush branches, okay for geraniums or roses, but not for trimming back bushes. They are a disappointment. AND they took literally months to arrive!"
3,So so bypass pruner,Blade not well aligned. Have had to work with it so that the blade doesn't hit the other side of the shear. There are better ones around.
2,Returning these for exchange,"I just got these today. The ""conveniently located locking switch that is easily accessible by both left- or right-handed users"" has a lock made of plastic retaining a spring-loaded piece of steel. Guess what? In a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, steel always beats plastic, so there is now a groove carved in the plastic. It has never closed.My wife likes the shears and appreciates the gift, but thinks they should be able to lock. I agree. We'll see if there was a defect in this one or whether it is a design flaw."
1,Didn't hold up to a gentle-mouthed golden retriever,"Wow, am I unimpressed with the Tuff balls. Bought a 2-pack for my dog, thinking they would be better for him than regular tennis balls. Found that these are made in China, which doesn't inspire my confidence these days. It also says in the very fine print, under the staple on the back, ""Not a chew toy."" Huh? How am I supposed to keep my golden (60 lbs) from chewing the ball on his way to bring it back to me? Regular tennis balls last for months--this one lasted a day before it cracked almost in two. He had chewed the fuzz off it in another couple of days. Gave him the second one, and the same thing happened. The other review here sounds like it was written by a company employee, using the same words they use in their ad. I'll keep looking for the perfect tennis ball for Bear, but this ain't it."
1,Horrible smell,"After reading the other reviews, I'm wondering if there are knock-off Tuff Balls on the market. I bought a two-pack at Safeway in Anchorage Ak. I removed them from the pack and the chemical smell was overwhelming. I washed them and set them outside for several weeks. The smell is still there and as strong as ever. I threw them away. I wouldn't let my dog touch anything that smelled so toxic. They said Tuff Balls Industrial Strength Dog Toy, just like the insert on this website, but they were made in China, not the USA."
4,Read Ruthie Black,"Ruthie Black is one of those memorable characters. She's got guts and gusto plus she's got sex and love on her mind -- of course, that's a woman you're going to notice! Peter Brown is a storyteller who knows how to make his story people vivid and his storyline compelling. There were passages in Ruthie Black where I read a sentence and thought, ""This line is absolutely perfect! It captures the situation, the scene, the moment, so well you can practically see it, feel it, taste it."" Get ready for a great read because Ruthie Black is one of those memorable books."
2,Fine Until it Broke,"Worked well until the switch broke. The design of the switch on the handle is NOT a good idea. I had this kettle less than a year and it died. For the last few months, the switch would automatically turn off before the water was really boiling, so it must have been going. Buy something else."
1,Leaking Kettle,"Our first Krups kettle began leaking after a year's use & reckoning the leak was a fluke, bought a second Krups kettle. It too began leaking after 5 months."
1,HR,"DO NOT PURCHASE! we received this as a gift and it worked for about 2 months. we relied on it to boil water for our newborn. when it broke, we contacted Krups and paid to have it repaired, they sent it back exactly the way we sent it in and WE paid for the shipping. Krups is a TERRIBLE product and I would not recommend them ever. We were reliant on this for our newborn and it was expensive to replace, these don't come cheap. I'm extremely disappointed."
4,Krups electric kettle,We ordered this kettle as a replacement for the Krups electric kettle we previously owned. We like the ease of operation and the reliability of the manufacturer.
4,Great kettle for tea!,"Love this quick working kettle for heating up water for tea, hot chocolate or instant coffe in a jiffy. It automatically turns off when the water is boiling and keeps the water hot. Great product!"
1,leaks,2nd try on this one. First lasted 3 years and started to leak around handle. This one is leaking after 3 months
2,Great until it leaked!,"I bought this electric kettle after trying another brand that I didn't like (water always had a bad taste). I loved it immediately and used it nearly every day as the taste was good and it boiled the water quickly. I even bought another one (from Amazon) as a gift.One morning this week, I came into the kitchen to find water all over the counter and floor. Apparently it began leaking around the handle and without my knowledge and without anything happening to cause the leak. I went on line to see if I could just replace the kettle as the heating element was still good; but to no avail. Now I will replace it with another brand as I don't want to spend the money on a new one every year."
2,Purchased for my Mom,"I have a black one which has operated flawlessly for three years. This unit I purchased for my mom was problematic from day one. My brother, very electrically gifted, kept it going a few months but in the end, it imploded and was tossed."
1,LEAKY!,Six months old and it's trash! Very disappointing.I'm not sure why it is required that we have at least 20 words for this review but I'm willing to meet that requirement because I'm so angry that I spent $50 on a kettle that only lasted 6mos.
2,leaked after 6 months,"A pity as did boild fast, worked OK for 6 months. Then..leaked. Looks like a common problem looking at other reviews. Will not be buying another, or Krups for that matter"
2,Krups has cheaped out.,"I am very disappointed in my new Krups white cordless electric kettle. It is a replacement for one just like it that lasted more than 5 years. It was great. However the new one is different although it looks the same. The outside gets very hot, and it takes much longer to heat up. I should have paid attention to the other reviews that said the new model had these problems. It does."
2,After a year of use it started to leak.,"Perfectly designed with every little detail well thought of.Boils water very fast, takes less then five minutes even when its full.After a year of daily use it started a to leak."
1,Similar Problem - Bad On/Off switch,"I experienced the same problem as others here with the On/Off switch of this unit. The one moving part on the unit and it was faulty. Go figure. It simply would not turn on. Tried all the tricks and nothing. We had the unit for only about 6 months when it went on us. I would not buy this unit if considering a new one. If I got one as a gift, I would return it for cash."
1,A clunker kettle,"This kettle has been a major disappointment. Purchased to replace an older Krups kettle that gave years of great service before expiring, this model lasted just nine months before failing. Krups provided a replacement at no charge - a process that took three weeks - and the replacement kettle has failed after four months. The weak part of this model seems to be the on-off switch in the handle.In my opinion, the name Krups no longer stands for quality, dependability, and longevity. This particular model of kettle is a cheap Chinese clunker - avoid it."
3,Krups Electric Kettle,"I had a Krups kettle, made in France, for many years and liked it. When I needed a new one, it wasn't the fault of the kettle. I ordered another one like it. I was dismayed when I got it to learn it was made in China.I've read too much about Chinese manufacturing.This kettle takes six minutes to bring a kettleful to a rolling boil.It had a nasty plasticky smell at first. It took many kettles of water boiled to get rid of it. I'm still reluctant to use it for food."
3,"Works well, but lid is a pain.","I have long wanted a kettle that will boil water in a minimum of time. This product fulfills that need, but unfortunately the design of the lid keeps me from giving it best marks. You have to take the lid completely off to fill it, and it can only be put back on one certain way. I know a lot of people are worried about plastic and funny smells/tastes......I did not experience that but I have always used glass kettles on the stove. So while this is a decent kettle, I bought a second one that I hoped would be better. And voila!! TheToastess TGK486 Cordless Glass Kettle, Grayis that kettle!!! Made primarily of glass rather than plastic....with an attached lid that flips up and down. Attractive and every bit as fast as this one. Sorry Krups.....rethink your lid design!! Also the Toastess is slightly cheaper."
1,Do Not Buy,"This lasted for less than 400 uses. There are only 3 service locations in the Northeast and none were near me. When asked how long these usually last the customer service rep did not have a good answer. Since mine was out of the one year warranty, the only thing she could do was send me a rebate coupon for a new one..I don't think so!"
1,base switch broken the third time,"Kettle has a design problem with the base switch - I wouldn't buy this, I'm about to get refund.Krups is normally reliable, but not this time, they probably outsourced it to China."
2,Switch broke after less than a month or use,"Just as many of the reviews have mentioned, the switch has stopped working. I am now faced with packing, and mailing (and paying for the mailing) to get it repaired. Otherwise, the kettle seems to work okay."
2,Doesn't Work After a Year,Worked fine until just after the one year warranty. Now it won't turn on. The switch doesn't work. Tried descaling but to no avail
1,Unreliable,I am about to return the fourth kettle I have received in about seven months. The first one worked fine for maybe three months and then died. The second didn't work straight out of the box. The third one worked for about two months. This last one again didn't work straight out of the box. This time I'm going to ask for a refund.
1,Very low quality. Aviod this model,"I owned previous model for many years and it was an excellent kettle. This one is an overpriced junk.First of all after less then a year of very light use it started leaking water where the bottom of the handle is attached to the pot.Also the design of the lid required better quality of assembly and/or parts. With the current quality it stacks in a such position that you can not turn it to open or close position. You can get it out using knife, but this is really bad quality of parts as my previous Krupp kettle served several years without any problems.The smell of plastic diminished with time, but remains pretty strong for the whole life of the kettle.Avoid this product. For the same price you can get a better stainless steel unit although all of them are assembled in China. So it is better to buy it in a real shop so that you can return it quickly if unit is defective."
1,Premature switch off,This was purchased for my 85 year old mother-in-law and it doesn't work. The button that you push to turn it on always switches off before the water is boiling. If you want hot water one must stand and hold the button down till the boiling occurs.I wouldn't buy this brand.
2,Kettle stopped working after about 6 months,"Initially, water boiled in the kettle smelled of chemicals (I assume from the plastic), but this problem went away after using the kettle for about a week ... after which it worked well for about 6 months.However, the kettle has now stopped working ... the problem seems to be in the electrical contact in the base ... I was able to get it to work by pressing down hard on the kettle ... but now, even that does not work.I am disappointed, as I had expected a Krups product to be more durable"
2,Won't last long,This kettle worked fine for a few months. Then the on/off button started experiencing problems that others have described. Would not stay on. Most recently it developed a serous leak and leaked all over the counter and floor. Would not recommend it.
2,"Lasts about a year, then leaks","I've bought 3 of these from Amazon thinking I'll get lucky next time and the same thing won't happen. Well it always does. This electric kettle works great and is super fast and looks nice, but after around a year of daily use (2-3 times a day) the base springs a leak and water drips all over the counter. Beware."
1,Cheap plastic,I have had TWO Krups cordless kettles. The base of the first one lasted one year before it cracked and leaked the entire contents. The second one lasted 6 months before the same thing happened - today. It is junk.
5,"The Riddle Of Gender: Marci Bowers, MD","This is the best Gender-related book I've read thus far. It delves far beyond the woman-in-man's body metaphor to cover historical and current theories about gender and why, like any other human phenomenon, gender is represented best by a biological diversity not necessarily aligned with one's natal genitalia. It also delves with style into recent history offering a chilling echo from Nazi Germany into what intolerance holds towards gender variance. This is a book that everyone over age of 18 ought to read. The personal accounts were also very telling. Great book."
5,Very informative,"I am Transexual myself, and this book taught ME lots, let alone what it would teach the other 99.99% of the population, highly worth reading.Plus many of the interviews are quite enjoyable!Add on it was really easy to read, and you have a brilliant book!10/10"
4,Roots Music Done Right!,Norton Buffalo and Roy Rogers once again team up for their brand of delta style root music. This Northern California duo seems to compliment each other in both vocal and musical harmonics. The disc consists of 13 originals comprised of 2 instrumentals and the vocal duties split equally with Buffalo singing the lead on 6 tracks and Rogers on 5 of the tracks. The acoustic duo doesn't break any new ground on this disc but their consistent roots style of music will be welcome listening to their fans.
2,"Great Musicians, but...","Check out the YouTube videos of these guys. Roy Rogers is a great guitar player. The late Norton Buffalo was a fine vocalist and harmonica player. The evidence is there.The music on this disk was well-produced and performed masterfully. The compositions on this disk, however, didn't appeal to me. The themes did not resonate emotionally, and I found the lyrics to be awkward, stilted almost. I was disappointed.Now I fully understand that my reaction to the disk might say as much about my taste as it does about the music, yet I really wanted to like this but found I couldn't. Sadly, I can't rate it at more than two stars.As always, your mileage may vary."
1,Bad Service,"Handsgrohe has the worst&#65279; customer service, if you want good quality and service buy Kohler.I had a problem it took 10 emails in two months for them to try and resolve my problem, I will never buy another product from them."
4,Ultimate drills for champions,"Even if you, like me, don't intend to be a champion pro (maybe an Am champion...?), these drills will improve your game for sure. Anyway they are the pro's drills. I've checked many other sources in books and DVDs and these are the most common drills advised for golf players. And no other source were so complete. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because there are only drills. It could be completed with a swing overview, in order to make the drills more understandable (some of them are really weird and you have a hard time trying to figure out how they could possibly improve your swing). This is not in this book because the author has another book only on the 8 parts of the swing. But it worths the price. Above all, remember: these are just drills, and you are not supposed to play that way in real games!!!"
2,So So,Just an ok book. Pictures are low quality. Would have expected better from Golf Digest and Jim Mclean. It is straight and to the point but make sure you at least have a solid working knowldge of all aspects of the game before considering this book. You can get much of the same information for free at various golf web sites. Not bad but not very clear in many regards.
1,Terrible for golfers who know the game,This book is for the real beginner as the title of the book is totally misleading
2,Toss away bibs,"I prefer the bibsters. The quality on the toss away bibs is not as good - the material is quite thin, the closure uses a sticker that never stays closed."
1,Very Weak,"I picked up this book with an open mind to see the argument against school choice. I am still waiting. The Authors of this book display an invincible arrogance about the intelligence of legislators and buraucrats compared to parents, constantly offering the opinion that parents are simply too stupid or immoral to seek the best education for their child. The authors go on to praise the value of an education, as if proponents of vouchers somehow wanted to end education. Finally, the authors failed to rebut the arguments about the dangers of school bureaucratization forcefully offered by Chubb/Moe's ""Politics, Markets and America's Schools."" A book no serious student of education policy should take seriously"
4,Great reel mower,"It's easy to push, and cuts bermuda and St Augustine AND even thick weeds very well. If yuour grass is too tall, it will lay the grass down rather than cut it, but if you keep up with cutting, it's great! I like that I can even go out at night if I want to, and mow. It's not whisper quiet, but as long as you're not mowing under your neighbors window, you can pretty much mow the lawn without disturbing anyone. Also, when you walk behind it, you don't get hit with rocks and grass and dirt, like you do with power mowers. You can finish mowing with your pants and shoes as clean as when you started.It's not as fast as a power mower, not by a long shot, but it's not a bad way to mow the yard. It is less stressful, less expensive, and less damaging to your hands, ears, and sinuses! I'm glad I bought it!"
1,It was supposed to MOW the lawn,"While this mower trimmed small patches of clover and leafy plants, it simply squashed down my grass without cutting it. It wouldn't cut anything taller than just a few inches, which I suppose is fine if you want to mow your lawn every other day. Any little piece of debris will stop this mower in its tracks - even a patch of grass a bit thicker than usual. My yard looks terrible and I am returning this mower immediately. I do not recommend this mower."
1,Came apart in pieces all over my lawn,"I thought perhaps that I didn't put it together right or that some parts might have been defective, so I returned it and replaced it. But I was right the first time. This thing doesn't stay together long enough to mow an entire lawn. Nuts and bolts flying off in the middle of a push. And, when you actually get it to hold itself together, it just squishes the grass down and doesn't actually cut anything. I found myself using my weed wacker to clean up all the areas this thing didn't get to. Eventually I realized I should just leave this piece of crap in the basement and use the weed wacker on the entire lawn."
1,Chinese made,This was not made in the United States. It is Chinese manufactured. American doesn't look like it makes American good anymore.
2,Buy this with caution,"I have a small yard with new Zoysia grass. I wanted something economical to cut the grass. There is a reason they invented power mowers. Hand push reel mowers have a difficult time cutting thick grass. This mower did a fair job when the sod was new and the grass was not too thick. Once it got thick, it didn't cut well at all and took forever. The grass catcher is a complete waste of time and money. I cut the grass every week without fail but still couldn't make this work. The smallest twig will cause it to jam. Adjustments are cumbersome. Unless you have a small patch of grass, forget this product. It isn't a bad reel mower, it's just a bad mower."
2,Best only for flat lawns that are mowed often,Doesn't work with high grass. Doesn't go backwards. Hard to use on uneven ground. Thought I would save on gas with this.
4,Works very well,Easy sharpening kit is a Plus! Just don't let your grass get too high or all reel mowers become useless.
4,Lawnmower,"Works great, but is a little more of a workout that I thought it would be.Much quieter that the gas mower and no air pollution!"
1,American Lawn Mower,"I purchased this product to mow a postage stamp of a front yard.While it may cut some of the grass it passes over the weeds and does not cut them, they just bounce back up.I am very disappointed in this purchase."
4,The best sci-fi for TV ever.,"What can be said about B5 that hasn't already been said? This is a 5-star show, but this box set loses a star because the pciture of the B5 station on the box is upside down."
3,Good Stuff,"Sounds like a good indie power-pop/punk band should. Loud, rockin, and intense. Great hooks, great lyrics dominate throughout - especially with the opener ""Ignition.""Only downsides - too short (8 songs in 25 minutes) and it sounds a little under-produced with vocal and drum tracks that could have used a little more volume overall. Either that or my stereo [is really bad]."
2,Not funny at all,"My wife had seen this movie earlier and told me how great and funny it was. She didn't tell me it was a mockumentary. That didn't become evident until about 20 or so minutes into the movie when the d-bag of a producer was telling the boat captain that they would have to swap out the engine for a quieter one because the sound guy was complaining about the engine noise. I didn't find anything about this movie funny or entertaining. Every time she laughed at something, I felt as though I were standing on the outside of an inside joke. After about 40 minutes, I was bored and ready for this movie to be over."
2,Watch it on cable...,...not worth spending money on but of educational value...Herzog appears to be spoofing documentaries in general and it's instructive to the extent it shows how the viewer can be manipulated by the film maker...but aside from that it's not very funny or entertaining.
2,Eh....so so.,"This film cleverly comments on myth and also specifically perpetuates the myth of the Loch Ness Monster. Granted, it does this in a way that demands the viewer to almost humor the movie and give it props for trying. I found that none of the gags were ever quite funny enough and the acting was often not good enough to pull the wool over my eyes.What I will say having been a Loch Ness Monster fan as a child, was that the fairly anti-climatic climax of the film where the creature attacks the crew was fun. Not anywhere near as kick ass as Jaws though. We never really get to see the Loch Ness Monster in this film. This is a sad thing as this film certainly didn't have enough laughs or acting to carry itself, and you just feel let down when the film ends. A retarded CGI of the beast would have made it all better! Two people drown but we don't believe it anyway. We really don't care. What did the movie accomplish? I am not sure."
1,Herzog files for intellectual bankruptcy,"The first quarter of the film is tedious, the second quarter funny, the second half both tedious and stupid."
5,Interesting twist on the military and mercenaries.,"I liked this book and the second in the series ""Lieutenant."" As a military retiree I can see the place for military units other than those of a government. Further, I see that with a fair standard of ethical and moral conduct that troops employed as a free lance military can have a beneficial effect on the governments that employ them. Rick Shelley is a good author, I also recommend his trilogy of the 13th Spaceborne (""Until Relieved,"" ""Side Show,"" and ""Jump Pay"")."
2,"A Tactical Manual, But Fiction?","Not much of a novel. The small unit tactics and combat were interesting to this former infantryman. However, there wasn't much plot, the progress of the story was dully predictable, there was never much sense of danger to our hero, and the enemy was bland and distant. Try another series ... like the Starfist series or Honor Harrington."
1,Give it a miss,"I appreciated ""Hammer's Slammers"" much more after reading this one, which is a shame as some of his others are not bad at all. I agree, go find an S.M.Sterling or David Drake book."
3,The Life of a Soldier,"I found this entire series to be very enjoyable. Some have complained that the series lacks a ""big-picture"" or and real plot. While it is true that the seires lacks these elements that we expect from any good book I think in this case it was intentional on the part of Shelly. This series lets us see what its like for the soldier at all the various levels of command. You can fell his fear and danger in the first few books as he is in the trenches. Later as he becomes a higher ranking commander we fell him struggle over command decisions. I think this series does a wonderful job of showing us war from the average soldiers point of view. The plot his his life, and as the series progresses the story and plot become more and more a part of the books."
2,More of the same -- and it is a bit pointless . . . .,"While in general I like this sort of military sci-fi, I find myself a bit bored with the lack of a bigger picture. Shelley is good at setting the stage, but in the end, it is all about a few guys fighting as mercenaries. No context, no good vs evil, no real reason. Just war. I want to know why people are fighting and dying, not just that they are doing it."
2,Military might with no bite.,"I'm a fan of sci fi military books-started with Heinlein, enjoy Drake and Weber. I was hoping for a decent soldiers-in-arms read but instead got a comic book minus the pictures. If you like characters with some depth, don't buy this book. If you enjoy reading about the clash of cultures and what life might be like in the future, don't bother. However, if you want a pure plot driven story that goes into excrutiating military tactical detail, this is the series for you."
2,Beyond routine into the boring,"Unlike most military SF, this has neither moral quandaries, interesting tech, bloody melodrama, or philosphical musings. Or, for that matter, interesting characters, compelling plotting, or much reason to finish, let alone pick up the succeeding editions of the Dirigent Mercenary Corps series. Young cadet on his first tour faces a not-very-mysteriously-motivated civil conflict. Slogging ensues. Not bad, just numbingly pedestrian and routine."
3,A Good Sci-Fi yarn,"Rick Shelley has done a good job with this story, I just hope we get a little more out of the characters. The idea for the story is fantastic and the world he creates is also very good, but it is a tad predictable."
3,MIL/SF Popcorn,"If you've read all of David Drake, and S.M. Stirling, and David Weber ... then start in on Shelley. CADET looks like the beginning of a series. If LIEUTENANT is the next volume, Shelley may permit the central character a personality this time.The mercenary-world theme, while not original, is well done. The best characterizations were the squad members. The worst literary trick was the medic tubes; Come on, Rick, if you have to kill off a character, at least let him die!"
3,A combination of other plots,"After reading the books, I felt I had read the same story by Gordon Dickinson and Jerry Pournelle. It looks like Shelley stole ideas from Dickinson's Dorsai and Pournelle's Falkenberg's Legion. I wish the author would actually read the current literature on military technology. If it is 2800 why are the soldiers still fighting with the tactics of the Vietnam Ar."
1,bad military sci fi; skip it unless you're a genre fan,"The author has potential but the book needs a lot of work.The opening premise is flaky and inconsistent with the cover blurb. The main character draft-dodges service with the Federal Police (a much tougher job than infantry, I might add); this is _not_ ""trumped-up charges."" He leaves Earth to sign up with patently unrealistic ""mercenaries"" on a cartoon-stage world.The main character is one-dimensional. The combat is late 20th century; the tactics and technology employed are pathetic. A company of 20th century Marines could eat both sides for lunch; oh, and has the author ever heard of orbital bombardment? Infantry GPS? Crew-served weapons? _ARMOR?_ The client world has neither a distinct culture nor any realistic means of paying mercenaries.I'd recommend S.M. Stirling and Jerry Pournelle instead. After reading this book, I rushed to grab my copy of _Falkenburg's Legion_ and get the taste of this one out of my head."
4,Buy it if you love fast Mexican music,"I enjoy this CD. Most of the songs are lively, a couple on the slow side. Overall a keeper for many hours of enjoyment. Bob of Solon"
5,A fascinating look into the Confederacy and the life of a Southern politician,"I had the privilage of being Dr. Young's student where he teaches college (Carroll Community, Westminster, MD) and his facts on Mason are endless. He speaks of Mason as if he knew him personally and that's the mark of a good historian who's done his research. Sometimes historical biographies can be a bit dull, but this was interesting and I enjoyed reading about Senator Mason. I would recommend this as a book to be read by U.S. History students or Civil War buffs."
5,Fabulous Album!,I bought this album shortly after seeing Yellowcard in concert in Seattle at The Premier. They rocked and so does this album. I also own the other albums the Yellowcard has released. The Underdog LP is nothing short of amazing. It has excellent recording quality and the songs are awesome. I love the beautiful marriage of the classical and smooth violin and the punk rock origin of the songs. I would definitly recommend buying this album. And don't hesitate to visit their website to get to know the band a little better!
5,A lil goes a long way,"The Yellowcard Underdog EP has some of Yellowcards best stuff, Powder and Avondale have amazing vocals. The message in Powder is positive and very strong. Being a member of the Yellowcard underdog team, as Lacerbabe99, I am very impressed, this album is a good album to get to give your ears a taste of What Yellowcard is all about."
5,amazing,"This Cd is awesome, very powerful. I think it had a lot of meaning and it is Yellowcards best cd they have. I recommend it to everyone who loves yellowcard or their type of music."
4,Holden McNeil is a BRAINDEAD IDIOT,"holden mcneil is obviously a braindead moron, seeing that A) he doesn't like Yellowcard and B) he chose to give this 1 star and turn around and give some book on satanic gothic underground black metal 5 stars.......riiiiiiight. well i'll listen to the GOOD music and you can go worship satan and sacrifice animals and listen to bands that TRULY have no talent. it takes no talent to scream and be unhearable on stage. 2 power chords? please....you'll be lucky to distinguish what 1 power chord is on one of your hideously bad cds you like.anyway enough about people that don't know their ass from a hole in the ground. hands down this cd is great and you should get this along with Ocean Avenue.....Ocean Avenue is amazing. I cant wait to see what Where We Stand has to offer."
5,One of the most informative books on shoes,This great book is a very interesting reading and one of the most valuable sources for dating the shoes. If you work with historical shoes or just love shoes you cannot just read it once - you will be always using it! On many occasions this book actually helped to date the shoes correctly.
4,Good Series,"No French music? No long-winded promotional introduction? I was actually disappointed at first! Then I realized these tapes teach in a simple, direct fashion, and that with persistence they will substantially improve your French vocabulary fairly quickly. After three weeks I am no native speaker, but I already know that my vocabulary and pronunciation have improved. Is this the best series available? Not having tried others, I can't say. However, I can respond to other two reviews here at Amazon by saying: If you expect to learn a significant amount of French after having had the tapes for ""a day,"" you must be kidding. And I don't think someone who is not a French speaker is any authority on whether the woman on the tapes is pronouncing correctly. (Duh.) Her voice is a little high-pitched, but fairly pleasant. If I had more money, I would probably get the CDs for sake of ease, but when it comes to rewinding, any review is good review."
4,my favorite of her books!,"I found myself wanting to visit the Jewish ghetto in Venice. I found myself vaguely wishing that I'd had a bat mitzah. And throughout, I enjoyed the author's humor andher writing style. She treats serious topics ""lightly"" & quite effectively. I'd have given it 5 stars if there had been a little more resolution of the lost sonnets issue. Not so much resolution that the book's magic vanishes, mind you. It needs just a little bit more to be perfect."
3,My dogs are not that impressed,My dogs love the wet/can version so I thought I would buy them some dry to mix with the can. They seem to look at it just like any other dry dog food. Maybe they are spoiled. But at least they claim the products are natural and the Merrick brand seems to be nutritious overall.
2,Ok read considering the authors age...,"I wasnt really impressed with this book...it was aight tho...nothing more, nothing less"
3,pretty good read,"this book was better than i thought it to be, it was very interesting. Amina the stories main character was really something including annoying because of how niave she was, which was the cause for alot of her problems,she always reacted to quickly without thinking 1st. Her mom was a weak character and shady to say the least.Her dad, brother, and her dad's fiance became her family almost thru the whole book. Her boyfriend kayne was a really like-able character and they made a cute couple. although the book seemed abit rushed the ending was good but i felt a little sorry for Amina because how she ended up from jail to the nut house! she might have been kayne's down chick but she eventually cracked and lost her mind at one point, literally!!. but since this is mallori mcneal's 1st book i would say she did a good job creating an interesting street tale!"
5,Waiting for the sequel,"This was a very good book. It was hard for me to believe that the author was only 16. I am hoping there is a sequel so I can see what happens to Zelle, Kayne and Amina. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book that will keep you on the edge. I read it in one day."
2,DJ{New Jersey},"I wasn't going to read the book on the fact alone that the titled was misspelled. The K was left out on Chick, did anyone else catch that? Although I didn't enjoy the book I give applause to the young author for her efforts. I hope she continues to develop her writing style and I look forward to her next book."
5,Down Chic!!!!,First let me give big props to Mallori McNeal for writing such a griping story at age 16. You go girl and I look foward to reading more from you!Down Chic was off the chain I read it in one night I couldn't put it down. It's about a girl name Amina and she's lives alone with her mother until her brother and father show up and her whole word is turned upside down. Amina meets her boyfriend Kayne who happens to be her brother's best friend and she learns the true meaning of Down Chic!
5,It does the job,"For the less stubborn weeds, this weeding tool does the job. I would place the tool and twist it to get the more stubborn weeds. It might not dig up all of the weed's root but at least the weed is removed.If you have lots of weeds to dig, be sure to wear gloves. I got carried away in using it for an hour without gloves and started to develop a blister."
2,Scraper portion of tool is useless,"The pointed end of this tool that pries weeds out of the ground is handy. You get good leverage.That same design makes the triangular ""scraper"" portion of this tool useless. Theoretically, you can move the tool forwards backwards over the ground surface, and the scraper will scrape up small weeds with shallow root systems.The problem is 1) the scraper part is only sharp on one side and 2) the long handle prevents you from angling the scraper to get better a better angle on removing the weed.Putting the two tools together into one design doesn't work. I used this only a few times before I gave it away. Don't buy it."
4,Good weeding tool,"Great tool for dandilions and the like. A little larger ahd heavier than the one I used to have (and lost), but it works."
2,Neither Charger works well,Have experienced trouble with both chargers..Neither will fully charge the phone no matter how long you leave it on and the charge you get it is temporary..Havent tried the data cable yet but my hopes aren't too high i have the Lg vx9700 Dare btw
2,Data Cable does not work with VX5500,The Data Cable does not work with VX5500. Rapid Charger & Home Charger work as described.
5,Consise little book by a master,Feynman teaches his own diagram approaches to QED. Just think about it! And compare to the 3 vol. of Schwinger's text...
3,Enjoyed very much,"I thought this was a really good book with the exception of some editing errors. The book is about independant Leslie who is in school, and eager to get her career off the ground. She falls for a much older man with some major baggage is trying to figure out what she should do. Her ""cuz"" Rachelle is a single mother of three trying to juggle two men, and her life. The book is an easy read, and will hold your interest.Again my only complaint is the editing. In one chapter Rachelle is driving a white toyota, then in another chapter it's a blue Toyota. Then she is driving a blue Plymouth, that turns into a blue Mazda. I hope Hunter Hayes got a much better editor with the next book."
3,A year in the life of Leslie,"I almost thought I was reading a journal of the year that Leslie lost her virginity. I am not sure where the story was supposed to be going. Leslie seemed to have it going on - 21, a virgin, going to college, managing an apartment building. She meets Benjamin and falls hard for him. Only one problem, he lives with his son and another woman. Then there is Rachelle. She is Leslie's cousin. 35, 3 children, employed, a few too many men. Rachelle made some life changes. She went to school, started going to church and basically got her life together.Leslie and Rachelle changed roles somewhere in the middle of the book. Rachelle became more like the old Leslie and vice versa. THis book had 2 very funny parts where I actually laughed out loud, but other than that, I was just like reading someone's diary."
2,Proofreading a must,"The book I purchased had a lot of typo errors and sometimes the use of the wrong character. I was highly disappointed. Although I try to support as many African-American authors as I can, I found this book to be of poor quality. It had potential, but lost me with all of the errors."
4,"Good, doesn't come with a bag or hard-bag.","This is great for watching the Sun.I'm a newbie in this thing of astronomy, so my review is mostly with the pshysical filter than how it looks actually.The installation in the telescope is quite easy, you just have to use the screws to stretch it, and use the foami gums included to make sure it won't fall off (it is very dangerous, both for you and for the telescope).That said, the sun is kind of boring to see. I'm looking for Mars and Venus eclipses, and thinking on traveling where they are going to happen. That will make this filter more worthy."
3,OK filter / Overpriced,Filter works good and adequate build. I don't see anywhere close to $100.00 for this filter in the build. Value is questionable. Probably be just as well off with the mylar filter.
1,Outdated by his subsequent books,"If I were to reccomend one book by Braverman it would be:Younger Brain, Sharper Mind...Better use of money and time: focus on healthy life styleno white flour, sugar, saltlots of brown stuff: rice, whole gran, sea salt,lots of spices and herbslots of excercise and challenging actvities"
2,OK,I'm a nurse and felt this book hard to read even with my medical background. Would not recommend---should of been written at the patient level.....
2,"Grateful, and yet, a little disappointed","I found the assessments for our nature and deficiencies very helpful and will definately instigate some changes based on a few supplements and lifestyle changes. However, his extremely low fat diet, looks like less than 5%, is exactly the type that led me to be out of balance and very sick to begin with. There are very few doctors in this day and age that recommend fat levels that low and with good reason. Your brain is 2% of body mass, yet contains 25% of the cholesterol in our body. Go ahead and take out all the fat from your diet, and take some statins, you will be depressed, immuno-suppressed and weak in no time. So not a winner of a book, there are other books to help assess yourself and brain chemistry."
4,Edge Effect,"still reading, The book help you to think about your longevity and balanced in life so as time go on it will be helpful."
3,"The Edge Effect, etc.",I only read a portion of it. It was recommended to me but really the information in it isn't that important to me.
5,The Edge Effect (book),"Came in great shape, will use this service again. Recommend this seller to anyone looking for clean, great shape material."
2,Not a very smart book,"I bought this and the similar book 'balance your brain, balance your life' at the same time, looking for ways of treating depression naturally. The other book was very clear and helpful. This one just seemed sloppy. The authors just list everything they can think of that might boost dopamine or serotonin without any editorial judgement -- obviously nobody should take dozens of different kinds of prescription meds and supplements at high levels at once. Overall, OK, I guess, but other book, which seems less popular based on the number of reviews, was way better -- it felt like a doctor saying 'ok, here's all the things that might work, but this is the specific plan I recommend and i have found works with my patients' rather than a laundry list."
3,good but questionable personality theory,"I found this book pretty informative and did the tests, however, I did not fit into any of the personality types at all. Maybe it is just me. Addressing deficiencies in the book through supplements has helped with certain issues such as anxiety. This book is good for that, so I think it is useful, and some of the information is on target, but I find the personality theory lacking."
4,Informative Read !!!,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading the first few chapters, I was sure I knew my dominate nature and then after taking the test it showed different results. I now do agree with my new dominate nature. This book will stay on my shelf as a good reference book and one I would recommend..."
4,The edge effect,"The Edge Effect: Achieve Total Health and Longevity with the Balanced Brain Advantageseems like a good book, only 1/2 way through it. Glad I bought it."
4,Very fascinating !,"A very fascinating book with a remarkable number of Eucharistic miracles over the ages - does get a tiny bit repetitive but this woman had obviously put her time into research! I reccomend it highly as the stories are interesting and supportive to the truth of the real presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist. Buy it, get a warm drink and a nice blanket - and Jesus in the Holy Eucharist will warm your heart as you read the book!"
3,inspiring,"while inspiring, it becomes redundant. very educational but it begins to drag. i do recommend it . all people who believe should read it."
4,Review,Book arrive on time and in perfect condition. Have not finished reading the book yet but what I have read has been very good. The research that went into the book to document everything was very thorough.
3,"Fascinating, but...","Overall, I liked the book. It's a good exposition into Catholic teaching about the Eucharist, and these miracles are concrete examples of those beliefs and how they can strengthen the faith. However, I did have problems with the repetition of the blood libel charges so frequently leveled against Jews (for example, the miracle of Brussels, Belgium which involved physical desecration of consecrated hosts by Jews--a common theme in medieval and early modern anti-Semitism). Accounts associated with the blood libel add nothing to the book. Rather, they detract from the divine beauty of the miracles and unwittingly expose the darker side of Catholicism."
5,Important Book,There are more and more people today who do not believe in the real presence in the Eucharist. This book has the power to change many of those hearts. My only disappointment is that the miraculous events quoted are from centuries ago. These miracles are on-going and are taking place in many countries of the world in our own time.This is also an important book for young boys (and girls) who are preparing for altar service. They need to know exactly WHO they are dealing with at the Mass. With the help of this book they will carry their appropriate new reverence and attitude with them for the rest of their lives.
5,Great read,Short stories of desecrated hosts and how God showed his self through the miracles. Great for reading during perpetual adoration and also for proving to those who don't beleive the Eucharistic really becomes the body and blood of Christ. I only wish there were recent examples of miracles as most were from early 17th century.
5,Interesting & Inspiriing,"Great book. Consists of two or 3 pages of many, many miracles. Not a commitment to read the whole book to get the meaning. Interesting for kids too. I always keep an extra copy on hand to lend to a friend if the subject comes up on how important the Eucharist is to Catholics & what makes us Catholic."
3,More like a play than a movie,"First , I really wanted to like this movie even though I did not expect another Schindler's List type feature. The producers must have saved a lot on the very restrictive set. Let's not forget that this is the Warsaw ghetto but there are plenty of other movies which are not so claustrophobic. I'm sure this claustrophobia is more related to a limited budget than to the artistic message they want to send. 2 other things which in my opinion did not go well: The main character may be a good actor but he does not fit the physical description of a rabbi very well - especially his facial features. Without giving out the ending, I do not believe a father and especially a rabbi would have acted in the manner portrayed, but would rather have used his body as a shield for the endangered party in question.I realize I was somehow negative in this review - there's plenty of positives and I don't feel repeating the other reviewers."
3,Clever,"Overall the book had the same quotability as 'Dermaphoria', however I felt the ending was a bit rushed and haphazard. Still, I will undoubtedly say Clevenger is one of the most quotable writers of this generation."
3,Dissapointing ending,"I'm not going to spoil the ending, but it just kind of left me hanging. Now if there is a continuation, great, if not, big let down. The story is very intriguing, with good twists and turns, but the ending just kind of lacking. An extra fingure and a talent for drawing can go a long way in this book. Check it out."
2,Can I Have My Five Bucks Back?,"Chuck Palahniuk should expand his library if this is one of his favorite books. It isn't bad, it just isn't that good.The book didn't really end. It was more like it gave me the finger and spit in my face just as there was mercifully nothing left to read.The narrator kept repeating himself as if I would forget if he didn't keep reminding me of the same details of himself (First Person).I didn't care about any of the characters and the plot was dry. The writing itself was kind of... nice.I would recommendApathy and Other Small Victoriesby Paul Neilan instead."
1,Worst Read of my Life,"The plot is aimless. Clevenger's style is at best mediocre, at worst painful. The characters are hardly believeable. This is by no means 'a work of genius.'"
2,Great writer - weak book,"This is a talented writer who creates strong characters, imaginative environments and makes cutting social commentary, but unfortunately wraps it up without a coherent story line. It starts strong but ultimately peters out into nothingness. I finished it more from my compulsiveness than on merit of interest."
5,Fast Read,This was a pretty quick read for me. It keeps you interested by seeing how the main character keeps changing his identity and evading capture. It also makes you wonder if something like this could happen in real life.
3,It Was Good,"I heard for years what a great book this was but in the end it was decent. Not amazing, though it certainly was a page-turner at first. I found the ending to be a little too contrived and wrapped up too neatly for this sort of book, but it was still a good read."
4,A solid read,"Craig Clevenger's ""The Contortionist's Handbook"" provides a solid ""in between"" read. It's the kind of book you can easily finish in a few sittings while deciding what novel you want to really immerse yourself in next. The characters and plot develop well throughout and the language used is excellent. It's lack of depth is what keeps it at the level of a fun read for me and will keep it from being an all time great, though the author himself shows great promise. I do recommend this book, though. Well worth the price."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read in my entire life,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! I picked up this book because i was intrigued by the premise and happend to hear about the author through a certain writer's website. This book is horribly written, corny, predictable, and at many moments i found myself laughing at loud at what the author actually thought was worthy of writing. This book goes into the catagory of those teenie bopper high school large print novels. Please dont waste your time. If you want to read a real book go out and BUY my favorite book of all time ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" by the late and beloved hubert selby."
4,Discrete Bulova Dress Watch,"There are two reasons it doesn't rate 5 stars. A mineral glass crystal and it is non thermal compensated quartz so it's not as accurate as more expensive time pieces.Having said all that, it's hard to fault it for what it is. A good looking elegant watch that's not showy.The watch looks great with a dark suit and white shirt."
4,A fairly good watch for its price,"This is a very nice Bulova watch. Although the date window is kind of small, the overall style is great.This watch is worth its money."
2,Out of date!,"""Dummies"" is a great series but this particular book is woefully out of date (2003). Please revise and republish!!"
5,Wow!,"It's a shame more people haven't had the chance to enjoy the beautiful world West has crafted. The characters She has created are nothing short of astonishing in their complexity and the intricacy of their relationships. If you enjoy epic fantasy with wonderful characterization and eloquent prose akin to Guy Gavriel Kay, than read this series."
4,great series,"This is a great series, very well written and you get easily drawn into the storylines.One of mye top ten favorite fantasy series."
5,Awesome Series,"The Sun Sword is the last book in the Sun Sword series. I love everything Michelle Sagara/West writes. When this series is published electronically I will buy this for my Kindle. This series ties in with the House War series. These books are a bargain because you will read them more than once. They are big, fat paperbacks that will keep you entertained for more than a few days. This book is 957 pages of excellent world and character building. If you like series this is a great one. It helps if you read the first three House War books, then the Sun Sword series. After this series you can continue on with the House War. You won't be sorry but you will be addicted."
3,not what expected,"Ok, so this final book in the series starts out on the eve of war and 834 pages later we're still on the eve of 'War'. Yes lots of character development and subplots but after the first 300 pages this gets 'turgid' and somewhat boring. A better editing job could have revealed these nuances while still moving into the action we've waited 5 books for. I would say this was the weakest of the series. Given that each book is 800 pages long there is no excuse for the same repeated insights into the characters motivations, backgrounds, etc."
5,Empowering lessons in true perspective.,"Bruce E. Levine has the credentials that he himself says are proof of compliance. All the same, for those of you who need to know that an author is thus entitled, it may aid you in pulling yourself together to understand some of this. It is time to stop taking all those dangerous psychopharmica. It is time to drink only for a bit of loosening up, but not to handle these bourgeois blues. It is time to understand that we are the other people you are the other people to. The statistics are here in this book, served up for your easy digestion of them. This book just makes me a happier person. Can you dig it?"
5,good spy songs,"I liked the instruments and the special way the music is done, and if you like just music i'd get it cause it's good."
4,Not all cats like it,"I give it 4 stars because it's well made, has a powerful catnip aroma and i'm sure other cats would love it, because of the metal spring like wire that bounces around. But my 10 year old cat wasn't too interested by it (or the catnip), no matter how much i've tried. I think the metal wire that sometimes makes noise every time it touches a hard surface (like furniture or the hardwood floor) scares her a little bit.Anyway, i knew it was a high chance that she might not like it, as many other commercial toys i bought for her didn't sparked her interest. Only aluminium foil balls and threads make her happy.ps: if i would be the manufacturer, i would replace the plastic green mouse with something made from leather or something similar that the cat can grab with its claws."
4,not the best,The green plastic mouse make it too clumpy for the cats to play with. But it makes a good handle for you to hold on to as they play with the paper end.
1,beautiful but not effective,this hummingbird feeder is really beautiful to look at but the humming birds did not like it- i saw a few of them fly up to it and then fly away :( we finally went out and got one of the generic red bottom with plastic flower ones and they love it and visit it several times a day. so for some reason they did not like the look or the way this one is made or something... unfortunately!
1,Beautiful but does NOT work,"I have several feeders around my home but none as pretty as this one. Unfortunately, not a single humming bird would feed from this new one no matter how many locations I moved it to. I don't know if they can't feed but I do know they won't; so my old feeders are back and so are the humming birds."
4,Does the job,"This armband works well for my wife's ancient iPod...it would fit any iPod. It's basically a pouch, so no special access openings or anything, but it does the job while she's exercising. Seems well constructed. Fits her medium-sized arm."
1,Does not fit HTC EVO,"At one time they advertised this item to fit the HTC EVO. I made the mistake of believing them and purchased it. My phone will not fit inside the case. I see they now have removed the EVO claim. Too bad for me. Hopefully, no one else."
2,so-so product,Too small to 16 inch arm. not a great quality and looks much better on the picture than in real life. Not really made especially for nano - it's bigger than supposed to be.
3,Not great,"I use this with my EVO.Works ok, but I have some issues with the way the covering over the screen has waves in it once the phone is inserted. Makes functionally using the touch screen somewhat difficult."
3,over charged for shipping and amazon refuses to help,"I started to order this product with a hefty $30 expedite. Just as I entered checkout, the Amazon window just disappeared. I started the process again and this time I decided to order without expedite. The next day I realized that a double order came through. Amazon, even though the order is their website, refused to help and said I could only get help from the company I ordered from. I called the company and was told I could always return the order, but they were already shipped. Several days later they arrived in one package, even though I was charged for one regular shipping and one $30 expedite. I wrote both Amazon and the company and only received $3 back. I complained again. Amazon refused to help and the company just kept repeating I already received a refund. I am hoping people read this to realize that if the product is not Amazon's product and there is a problem, they do not help and take no responsibility. I never knew this."
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"Before I purchased this item, I made sure to read the reviews they seemed pretty good. I remember reading one that said they sent the wrong one. Well one out of the other reviews.. I though my chances are pretty good. RIGHT? Think again, I too got the wrong one instead of 3 gal I got like many others the 2.5 gal. I called customer service and they responded ""in the description it says 2.5 gals"" and stated that they were updating all of the information. This is a joke they would not give me what I ordered and said they no longer sold the the 3 gal one. Don't buy this on amazon. Do yourself a favor."
1,No Scream Cream useless. Bringing tequila instead,"I bought this product after a painful 1st experience in (attempting) to get a Brazilian wax. (It wound up being more of a quasi-bikini wax because I couldn't take the pain) On my second visit to the spa, I took 2 painkillers and I applied a LOT of No Scream Cream about a good 45 min - 1 hour before hand. (I also seriously thought about downing some tequila, but decided against it, since I had no one to drive me home).I may as well not have ever applied any of the product. The pain was was not diminished in any way, and I was not able to tolerate getting a full Brazilian wax (again). I was so mad that the product didn't work and had there been any goop left in the tube, I would have thrown it away.Spend your money on a stronger topical anesthetic, especially if you have low pain tolerance.As for me, on my next visit, I'm taking the tequila with me. Arriba!"
5,The Go-Nuts are my favorite band!,"All the songs on Dunk n' Cover are instant classics: Hot for Twinkies, Cheetoe, A Day in the Life of a Snak Rock Superstar, Phat Like That, etc. Once you listen to this, you'll realize why the Go-Nuts are the premier Snak Rockers. Their altruism is to be admired (Let's Bring Cheese to China); their sole gole ""To make the World Safe for Snaking."" Extreme fun from the men that brought you Phantom Surfers, The Mummies, and the Go-Go Gorillas. SNAK ROCK RULEZ!"
4,Great Selection of Redgum,This record combines most of the classic Redgum songs--all worth the listening and some classics of music and thoughtful words. I used to have the tapes when they came out so it is great to be able to play the CD now.
5,A real one of a kind in its complete view of Turkish Lit,A real find for any student of Comparative literature or an interest in Turkish / Ottoman literature and culture. Probably the only complete anthology of it's type and definitely complied with love.
4,reborn,i give up. in a good way.modest mouse on the radio - never thought it could happen.you know what? i think it's great. brilliant.why do we bitch about bands not getting the credit they should but then bitch about the fact that they're getting too much credit? will we ever be satisfied? just accept the fact that great bands can make great albums like this and the masses will eat it up like sugar.
2,I bought the hype...,"But not the CD. I got it for Christmas and, after the requisite three listens, I can say that it does not live up to all the fanfare. It doesn't suck, but it's nowhere near great and certainly not the best of 2004. Float On was a great single. The rest of the CD does not come close.I find the style similar to early Talking Heads but not as good."
2,Ive lost hope....,"I listened to Modest Mouse when ""Building something out of nothing"" came out. that was a pretty good album. some nice tracks. I then moved to ""This is a long drive..."" not but a few weeks later, and this was even better. I loved them. The last Cd of theirs i got was Moon and Antartica. Let me say, this is my favorite album ever. Moon and antartica is better than pink floyd, radiohead, anything else. it was a masterpiece. I heard theyd had a new album coming out, so i looed into it. I was taken aback when hearing them on the radio. Not too much later, i was soon feeling weary. Modest Mouse made its way to TRL. not only did their new cd suck, but their single they promoted sucked too. Please, anyone from thirteen year old girls, to 90 year old men, buy mon and antartica or this is a long drive! This cd was mch too mainstream. to me, modest mouse had meant inie rock at itsbest. you guys dissapoint me. these tracks are catchy and crap. Moon and antartica! ok, thank you all."
2,"Not bad, but gets old... and quick","There are a lot of things to like about this band and this CD, especially as you listen through the tracks initially.I gave them 2 stars for trying to do something original with the music (moving toward more popular styles), although I would have preferred they stuck to original ideas more in the lyrics department. (IE: The nod to Bukowski etc. came off a little contrived I thought).Some great sounds and good development from the band away from their indie base, but on the whole a CD that quickly moved from my CD changer to my CD-organizer to ""to be traded"" pile."
3,"""How can someone inconsistent mess up so consistently?""","4 stars from rolling stone, carried with excellent reviews from pretty much every other reviewers that are highly thought of... I can see why... but still not. They mix epic pop songs, such as: World at large, ive got it all (most), float on, and (my personal favorite;) ocean breathes salty ,with crappy, boring songs. Every one seems to be fond of ""bury me with it"", which i find to be the worst song on the album by far. It's just teeerribly annoying. I wonder how many times the refrain runs on that song... It's unfortunate. Modest Mouse certainly have the potential. Ocean breathes salty is the best indie pop song ive heard since The Shins' New Slang, and that speaks for itself."
2,Can someone just say it without bias?,"These guys sold-out. I'm not saying that is a bad thing for the band (who can blame them for wanting to be famous?), just that this CD is clearly a move toward the masses from previous CD's.For my part what is pitched for the masses is really great music if you like that sort of thing.The rest of the CD is not real good for the masses, and really not as good as previous offerings from the Mouse either... so for many long-time fans a let down.I'd recommend borrowing before buying, and make up your own mind after a few weeks of play. I did, and was soooooooooo glad I did... I ended up going with the latest Vines instead and am loving it. For a long time fan, this was a turn-off."
2,Wine and Dine music... or perhaps Whine and Din?,"Is this the sort of music that goes great with a few beers and a BBQ with friends as one REALLY ""motivated"" reviewer suggested below? Perhaps. But between the self-pitying, whiney lyrics and the music that is more of a din than something you could dine to... this CD really struck out.If you are a MM fan, I'd borrow before buying on this one. If you are new to the Mouse, and don't particularly care for whiney lyrics and a CD that is more disjointed than usual... use the ""similar artists"" feature to find alternatives. Then decide. My guess is you will see through what the radio has done for these guys per their single, and will get something that is good through most of the CD. Either way, you will have a bit more info before you spend your money.Word to the wise: This site has quite a fanboy effect going on. So I'd be sceptical of the many ""positive"" reviews. Compare before you buy, but don't go by the reviews (pro or con) alone."
2,disappointing,"Modest Mouse's movement toward a more Flaming Lips-like sound unfortunately doesn't pay off here. While the first few songs work well and seem to suggest that the band has managed to create a more melodic, trippy sound, the rest of the album is a real letdown. It's indulgent, and you're not sure if it's becuase the band is trying the old ""this is meant to be unlikeable and it's your fault for wanting it to be likeable"" or if it's becuase they simply didn't have enough good songs to fill a cd.Definitely one of their weaker efforts, but perhaps a transitional album that will lead to something greater next time."
3,Decent effort,"If you're new to Modest Mouse, like I was a couple months ago, then you've come to right place. You've probably come across this page because of ""Float On,"" and granted, it is a nice catchy pop song but you won't find anything else like it on the album. I would say this album is half interesting, half dull. I mean some songs, whatever Issac is singing about is boring the hell out of me. I'm just gonna list some tracks I think are good: World at Large, Bury Me With It, Satin in a Coffin. Download these first, then see if you like it enough to buy it"
4,four stars,"Having never heard any song before Float On, I have to say I was a bit disappointed that the album wasn't as catchy as the single. But that was before I realized that I liked it. The album will (probably) open a first time listener's ears to different types of music, possibly taking them farther away from the mainstream crap that MTV consistently plays. I really liked the album for the most part, but I'm guessing I should probably buy earlier albums as recommended, just to see if this is really what Modest Mouse is about."
3,Bad news for Modest Mouse fans.,"I find this CD rather dissappointing.It's not bad... but it's not good either. I'll take The Moon And Antarctica or Lonesome Crowded West... or ANY Modest Mouse CD over this one. If you've never heard them before and are just getting into them, you'll probably think this is awesome. There is much better Mouse out there though.Standout tracks would be : World At Large, Float On, Ocean Breathes Salty, and The Good Times Are Killing Me."
5,Best Modest Mouse album yet.,"Upon the first couple listens of this album i wasn't impressed. Yet somehow i couldn't stop listening to it. Then I discorverd the excellence of this CD. This is the album modest mouse was created to make. All the years of making music were just leading up to this masterpiece.Yes it sounds different then previous albums, but isn't that good? Bands are supposed to evolve and change, and no, they don't usually do it on purpose or to ""sell out"" as many people claim. This album is so beautiful and the music and lyrics are just amazing. I couldn't have hoped for a better album from this band. And if they make another one, i'll buy it, and it won't sound like this, but that shoudln't matter. People change."
4,Coming to terms with death,"This is a good album if you are able to put it in the right context. Each of Modest Mouse's albums have some sort of concept behind them, and most are influenced by a certain 3 letter drug that was popular in the 60's.This album's concept is one that every person must go through, that of coming to terms and accepting the fact that you are going to die. Isaac Brock has written the story of a man who was told that he did not have much longer to live if he were to continue his life of excess; and the man decided to continue his life and die when his time came. I liked this, because everybody dies and it seems wrong to change doing the things you love to just live a little longer. In Samurai philosophy, people like that are cowards.I liked this album, even though most ""die-hard"" MM fans refuse it, a lot like Metallica. It is good, however, and people should just be more open minded and less stubborn."
1,Bad News For People Who Love Modest Mouse,"You might as well go find the most generic music, burn it on a cd, put a Modest Mouse 'Good News' sticker on it and sell it for green. Its lost ALL of the madness and magic it once possesed, and has been replaced by upbeat, stale trash."
1,good cd for people who love bad cds,This CD was absolutely terrible. I cannot believe how many people follow this band and have for years. They had one idea for a song and somehow managed to make it into 16 tracks. Completely unoriginal and boring.. Don't buy it.
1,Just... Bad....,"One of my friends is an avid Modest Mouse fan and she listens to it constantly in her car. It is interesting (if that is the right word) on the first listen, but it's just.. well.. BAD. Especially THIS cd. The tracks in the past have been somewhat bearable.. But this CD is full of awful vocals, dumb lyrics, and bad instrumentals. I'm a giant fan of indie music, but not to this extent. I feel like screaming whenever I hear this ""music"". It sounds like something a five year old could mix together. If you are a fan of weak lyrics, pointless songs, wasting hard earned money, using CDs as drink coasters, and/or blood-curtling vocals.. this cd is for you. But beware, if you are not an AVID MM fan, look elsewhere to spend your money. But hey, everybody's gotta have a good coaster once and a while!"
2,4 people who just want to know,"I'm really into music; play guitar, drums etc. I'm also very open minded to music. So I'm writing this review for people who simply want to know whether to BUY this album, or NOT. In otherwords, if the album is worth buying. Well, I can tell you that it's not really worth buying if you're not into this type of music. It's definitely different. They're sound is unique, and lyrics stand out a lot. Some songs are just not worth listening to. While others you can bare. But half of the album is decent. It's hard to review music, but I would say that it is somewhat worth buying. Mostly depending on your background with this band, or other music. If you like their main song, don't expect the rest to sound the same. There are only two main songs on the album. (float on, and Ocean Breathes Salty) The rest are ""average"". So buy this album if you like, I don't regrett it...It takes awhile getting used to, but it's modest."
2,First Impression,"I have listened to this album once. Only once. Yep. I am rating this album 2 stars after only 1 listen before it has a chance to grow on me. If you buy this new album expecting to hear ""The Lonesome Crowded West"" or ""The Moon and Antarctica"" you will most likely fling 2 stars at it like I did. Ok.. now it is time to address some of the other reviews here to set the record straight! This is not the best album Modest Mouse has ever recorded- so don't let any of those sunshiny reviews confuse you. Conversely it isn't an attempt at selling out and it is anything but pop. (Sorry pop fans... keep your wallet in your pocket until the new Shakira disc hits the streets). This is a bit of a departure for Modest Mouse that is neither great nor a total waste. It is just sort of there. But fret not... it isn't total crap and it will be a decent disc to throw in the ole 5 disc changer and hear every once in a while when shuffle permits."
1,Aptly named; like chewing on razor blades,"I came, I listened, I bought it. I listened (a lot more), I hated it (to the max), I sold it (quicker than a fox with a burning tail in a field of dynamite).Now the style of music I actually liked, but the more you listen to the lyrics the more depressing the CD was... so I thought maybe I'd check out another MM CD. Well that was until I read another reviewer below that said this was MM's ""up"" CD???!!For the love of mercy man, you mean to say this is the Mouse on a GOOD day?!!!!The music leans toward some fine efforts at innovation, but after a few spins in your player... fizzles. The experimentation (which I normaly love about a band) never really latches onto anything that makes the money spent worthwhile.So, in summary: The lyrics suck, but at least most of the music is bad. So if you REALLY love bad news (semi-angry/bitter people need not apply), I guess this review is a dream come true."
2,Like a warm cola on a hot day,"Great single, good variety on the rest of the CD. Its just that this CD looses its fizz the more you play it.Its more interesting though to read what the ""PRO"" (4 or 5 star) camp has written as defenses for why this is a good CD.The reviewer who wrote ""sit on it"" concluded to like this CD it may help to get stoned. Another said this CD might be depressing, but bragged that the other MM CD's were much more so. One Britney fan officially claimed this band for pop-culture fans everywhere. Some of my favorites indicated they were *clearly* more mature b/c they liked the cussing.I was going to write a review and let you know the reasons I hated this CD. But perhaps the best reason not to get this CD is the positive reasons given! Job done."
2,"Hello, I'm from the future...","I'm here to warn you NOT to buy this CD. Two days from now, you do buy this CD.A month later a friend finds out you have the same CD as his pimple-face sister. He tells all your other friends, and they exile you from all that is cool.As a result of not having any friends your social skills plummet, and you end up not being able to get any jobs. Within 3 years you starve to death wearing only a fairy-godmother outfit and a pair of combat boots.10 years from now the world is taken over by angry pimple-face sisters. Thats the problem, we need you to save the world.So please - for the sake the planet, don't buy this CD. Thanks, sorry to slow you down. See you in 10. *vanish*"
4,Not as bad or good as some people seem to think,"OK, this is probably not quite up to the level of previous Modest Mouse releases, but I'm sick of ""old-school"" MM fans complaining about what the group's become. There is, in my opinion, good material here. The first 4 actual songs are quite strong, although Float On and The Ocean Breathes Salty are a little too pop-like for my taste, but they're definitely fun to listen to. Then the album gets very variable for 5 or so tracks.. Bukowski and The View sound better to me than something like Dance Hall, which i consider almost unlistenable. And starting with Blame it on the Tetons, all of the tracks at the end are very strong. You can say they aren't incredibly groundbreaking, but they sound good! Why is everyone so concerned with these high falutin principles and whatever. They're really catchy songs! It's rock music for god's sake, not a philosophical treatise!"
4,"Good CD, but not Modest Mouse","I haven't listened to the radio in a couple months now, so I bought this CD, sight unseen so to speak, just because MM had a new one out. Sure, I thought it weird they were featured on an end of the aisle display rack at FYE, but I digress. From the first listen I liked the CD a lot, but it didn't sound like MM, save Isaac's voice and a few of their patented guitar pitch bends here and there.Basically, if you want a good new CD that has a lot of great rock-out songs on it and that don't all sound alike, this is a good one to get. If you want a Modest Mouse CD to hear the hype of the band in all their glory, go with something more like Lonesome Crowded West."
4,GASP,Either you love it or hate it! Its good not the best but very good. I would buy if i was you. so go for it! From what the reveiews show me more people love it than hate it! 4 and 1/2 stars!
2,I don't like it,"Don't even know how to review this album, there's really nothing I like about it. ""Moon & Antarctica"" was my favorite Modest Mouse, this is far and away my least. As others have said: no it doesn't sound like MM, yes it sounds like bad Tom Waits or worse, yes it's overproduced & under-thought-out. MM was one of the very last bands I was still excited about, but had I heard this album before I bought it, I never would have bought it. So if you're actually reading this review trying to decide if you should get the album or not, I would strongly encourage you to at least borrow somebody else's copy 1st. Maybe you'll be into it, and you can ignore this and the other negative reviews, but for those (like me) who are dreadfully disappointed with the disc, I think it would have been nice to have had some warning. If I'd never heard MM before and I put this disc on, I honsestly would have turned it off by the 4th song."
2,not very impressed,"With all the hype, mostly positive, about this band, I was really looking forward to hearing this album. Bought it, played it a few times and was puzzled. What's the appeal? Where are the good songs? Played it a few more times. Still not clicking. After a dozen listens I realized that this music was never going to impress me no matter how many times I played it. It didn't move me, or rock my soul, or do anything that would merit me keeping it. Not awful, but just nothing special in my musical world. Next, please."
4,A New Favorite,"I heard ""Float On"" on the radio while driving home from work and was immediately drawn in by it. It sort of reminded me of Talking Heads around the time of Little Creatures with a vibe reminiscent of ""Road To Nowhere', a fun sing a long yet artistic tune. I bought this CD and none of the material dissappointed.Modest Mouse are one of the more creative young bands in the studio and I plan on buying all of their CD's."
4,Sublime art-pop,"I walked in the door after a cross-country flight, opened my Amazon box, loaded this cd and walked down to the lake. Pure pleasure -- the jouncy, raking chords and beckoningly obscure lyrics inspired me to dive in. I only recently became aware of MM, and I have something like the feeling I had when I first listened to REM ""Reckoning"" (though a very different sound). It's so rare to hear a band crafting novel and uninhibitedly authentic music. I just can't wait to get home and listen again."
3,overrated,"I will admit, this is a good album, but I must say I am quite annoyed by anyone who calls themself a Modest Mouse fan, when they have only heard ""Good News For People Who Love Bad News,"" stating their favorite song is ""Float On"" and rating the album 5 stars. Good News For People Who Love Bad News is such a different album compared to the earlier albums, and although it is good, it can't even compare to the quality of albums like ""This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About"" and ""The Lonesome Crowded West."" I advise anyone who calls themselves a ""fan"" to go out and buy, not download some of Modest Mouse's earlier albums, and then they'll realize how wrong they are."
3,The Cure on Happy Drugs,"I think that's the best way to describe this CD. I heard it in it's entirety at a local bar and that was my first thought. I really like Float On and some other tracks, but a lot of them are way off. Some are way to strange and loud for my taste. On ocassions I found myself thinking ""Wow, this is a good song"" but on others I thought ""What is this bullsh*t?!""."
4,Not perfect but getting there.,"As listeners, we should be supporting new music that doesn't follow even it's own genre exaclty. I like Radiohead, Cake, Beck, and the White Stripes so immediately I took to Modest mouse. I really dig this album. It is up my alley one could say. The songs are well written if flawed. The chord progressions and instruments used are stray from the path of rock or electronic punk or whatever people want to call them. I've been listening to this album for about three days now and I'm not bored with it yet. I'm still feeling the album out, trying to figure the songs I like the best, but it's good rock you will not here on the music stations in my town. Embrace it."
2,Doeth He Have A Lithp?,"Well... putting it plainly... this cd is crap. & the lead singer i think as a lisp. It starts out okay with the first three songs & that's the only reason i gave it two stars (2 stars is really better than this cd should get... i was very nice) but then it just goes to crap & kind of offensive lyrics - he calls God a control freak & drops the ""F-bomb"" i think 6 (?) times. But if you like this kind of music i guess buy it... it just doesn't work out for me... meaning the lead singer is extremely aggravating to me. lol.The Verdict: Crap."
1,tragic,"this circular travesty known as modest mouse's new album is quite nearly worthless, however it does have a few uses/achievements i would like to outline: 1.the only cd more annoying than the aol free trials, 2.if you listen carefully to the video from abu ghraib prison you can hear this album in the background, 3.by far the BEST sing-along cd since raffi's ""the more we get together the happier we'll be"" 4.nothing, nothing at allto hear isaac brock being isaac brock and not epic's man-slave, check out his semi-single project ugly cassanova"
1,wow just wow.,"This album, to put it basic, is bad. Weak ""emo"" rock commercialized. It's a perfect thing for posers and trendwhores.. ""Oh wow, Modest Mouse is obscure enough to make me have music credibility! I'll whore it out to make me look cool."" Okay, you're saying. So what if people do that? It's still a good album, right? No. It's terrible. And horribly overrated."
2,new album blows.,"well unless your some yuppie who likes pop dont buy this album. If you had really liked the other albums by modest mouse you will be horribly dissapointed by this one. Every other album they have made you can listen to its entirity and be amazed while this is a horrible attempt to be mainstream pop that can be played on mtv. Epic managed to ruin one of the great bands of late and you would understand if you listen to all of there previous albums.The lyrics lack any meaning, the great sound of modest mouse has been dronned out into poppy chords that are unoriginal and under the potential of Modest Mouse. You will not be able to listen to this album more than once every 6 months because its nothing special."
1,"OK, I admit I liked this for a couple weeks","I heard these guys on the radio, I listened to all their tracks, I liked how each one was different. I read some of the reviews on this site and thought ""what are all the nay-sayers on about, this is awesome music!"" I bought the CD.After weeks of listening to the band do nothing but whine about how tough life is and how everyone else is too shallow b/c they are not miserable like they are... and all that to music that got more and more annoying; I drop-kicked it into the trash.Now its hard to believe how great I thought these guys were at first. Make no mistake about it - this is first rate whining to 2nd rate music."
1,Too eclectic,"I was not familiar with this band until I heard thier new single, Float On. I bought the CD on the basis of that song but the album itself is so eclectic ranging from pop to foul mouthed rock... then factor in those odd music rifts between tracks... I decided to passed the CD on to a friend after listneing to it only twice. I recommend you listen to multiple sample tracks before buying."
2,Bad news for people who like good music,"I am getting very tired of hearing a great song, buying a cd then discovering that the band put everything they had into one or two songs. In this case ""Breathe"" and ""Float on"" are excellent songs but the rest of the album is garage band fluff. This band is on the verge of being great but should not put out another cd until every song is ""A"" side material."
2,Explicit lyrics,The first songs were great but then the bad language started. Where is the explicit lyric label that music is supposed to have on it? I was surprised and disappointed.
4,"Grow up, kids. Isaac has.","No two complete Modest Mouse albums sound the same. That's not by chance, but because the band has always been evolving and changing with its members. Isaac has been through a lot, Eric has a child, and their drummer drugged his way out of this album. When you start as young as they did, and you live a life, your music SHOULD change -- especially when your music has been so personal and thoughtful. How boring would it be if your life was forever the same?So this album can definitely be frustrating to someone who might be late to the game or someone who, unlike the artists, has been living a stagnant life. But look back over their discography and look back over the lyrics. Learn about what Isaac went through and where he is now, and this album makes perfect sense.Don't hold it against them that the iPod revolution took place and now everyone listens to your once hip and private music."
2,Not the same.,"Good, but a more dissipated offering. Lacks some of the earlier savant brilliance, being a fan of older albums. And the political comments sound almost greenday esque, sorry."
5,The new Record...,"This record is much different than the others that MM have done so far.Its not as ""wild"" as those. Though there are some passages where they dont just play standart-Songs but really play there Intruments (If you know the old records you could know what I mean) they are more ""mainstream""-like now. Im not talking about the succes, Im talking about the musik.It still isnt bad but its different. They are still very interesting because they still try out new stuff and mix a lot of different genres on their Record.Also they seem to be ""clearer"" now and cleaner as well^^Over all I just say it is a bit different than the other Records but not worse, just good in another way."
4,One of the best of 2004,"I've never listened to Modest Mouse before this cd. I am a complete newcomer. In fact, I had never even heard ""Float On"" until a friend let me borrow this (I've since heard it countless times). Now although people have said that this cd is unlike their previous cds and too ""mainstream,"" I must say that if this cd is mainstream then Modest Mouse must be fairly quirky (which I gather they are). Anyway, the 1-2 punch of The World at Large and Float On is quite possibly the best introduction to a band I've ever heard. I love how it is almost one continuous song, both containing similar lyrics and song structure. Ocean Breathes Salty is great, too. This can easily take its place among the top ten of 2004 (surprisingly, there's competition this year!) Solid cd..."
3,"For Modest Mouse, this isn't great","It is still Modest Mouse, however. If you like this album get ""The Lonesome Crowded West."" Bought it 3 or 4 years ago and still listen to it. As for the current recording, they are now popular. This is not the daring Modest Mouse of old...But still worth the money."
3,Some great songs,"This album contains some great songs, such as ""Float On"", which is my personal favorite. I recommend listening to some of Modest Mouse's earlier albums, however, before deciding to purchase this one. To other Modest Mouse fans out there- this CD sounds very different from some of their earlier material, but contains a lot of great music as well. Be prepared for something completely different."
4,Isaac Brock suckered YOU.,"Some people may say Modest Mouse sold out. Some people may say Isaac Brock has lost it. I say he conned you MTV people out of money. What!? The rest of the cd doesn't sound like ""Float On""?? ""Wah, I don't like it when he screams on ""Bury Me With It""That's Modest Mouse. And while I'm not particulary crazy about the album as compared to LCW or M&A, it's still better that 99% of the crap out there. At least he put a catchy song on there to make them some money, and face it, they do deserve a little based on what they've done in the past. I'd like to give MM the benefit of the doubt, they'll have sold out when they're collaborating with Missy Elliot.Note to self: Don't buy a CD because you thought a song sounded cool on TRL."
4,"Yes, it is good news","Not having the benefit of a history with Modest Mouse, I'll spare you the boring diatribe about their influences and the good and bad news about this album. The fact is, though, that it isn't very often that a band rises from obscurity with a sound so different from the mainstream that it causes you to take notice immediately.Modest Mouse was one of those bands. When Good News came out, I started to hear Float On and The World At Large on the radio. I was impressed right away. Despite their influences, which I'm sure are large and varied as any good band, Modest Mouse has a sound that is absolutely their own.Based on how good this album is, and previous reviews, I will most definitely be checking out their earlier stuff. I would highly recommend Good News for anybody who likes modern music but gets tired of the same old same old that you hear on the radio every day."
4,Here's the trick:,"Hey, what's up with the David Grey slam in the Amazon review? That hurts, as a big David Grey fan. No matter.Here is the perfect way to annoint yourself with this band:Upon the first listen, I deemed this album to be crazier then a pet racoon. But, as a CD in my five disc changer, set on random, and filled with more melodic CD's like Iron & Wine, Rhett Miller, Josh Rouse, etc. I grew to like it. So much of my other CD's are very Elliott Smith in nature, so this was a nice foil. It grows on you, and in you. You dig?Then just sit back and wait for the medicine to work. Next thing you know, you can listen to and enjoy the album all by itself. Oh sure, it is still crazier then a gut-shot bomber, but it remains a good album nonetheless."
4,Modest Mouse's most accesible,"Many people have labled Good News for People who Love Bad News a sell out for Modest Mouse. Perhaps it is, but as Isaac put it himself he would rather be a sell out and pay the rent than a struggling artist with no lights. Modest Mouse's latest album is easily there most accesible, taking Isaac Brock's crazy lyrics and adding a melody to them. Float On, the bands first single of the record is simple but catchy, and one should not judge the entire album on that one song. Other songs on the album such as Bury Me With It and Bukowski are more complex and much stronger songs that will draw the older MM fans in. The lyrics are, i beleive as good as ever, and maybee depressing but knowing what Isaac Brock has been through i dont blame him. It may not be their best but Good News... is easily worth the money."
3,all this wait for nothing,"i waited and waited....checked their website to find any news on a new album release date. and after all the suspense to find this. i've dug on modest mouse ever since ""the lonesome crowded west"" which was amazing from start to finish. i grew to adore isaac brock's remarkable talent with his strings. i.e. 3rd planet, other people's lives, bankrupt on selling and so on.....BUT, after rushing my a** to the store to pick up ""good news"" and popped it in the ole spinner and heard ""float on"", i was disappointed. i figured they changed their sound that i had fell in love with for the greens. hey more power to 'em; at least maybe they can be on trl someday or maybe isaac brock will turn out to be in teen beat or something."
3,"Great, but not Great","Personaly, I loved Float On and Ocean Breathes Salty. They are my favorite songs yet, but the rest of the album was just plain wierd. Grant it, this is the first album of theirs that I've listened to, but still. Basically, the first couple of songs are awesome, but after that, it's downhill. I would still recomend buying it though just for the first few songs."
3,The deal with all the anti-Britney/ MM fan comments?,"I think Modest Mouse is great (the whole CD), almost as good as Britney's music actually... and I can see why there are many more like me who like both.So if you don't like Britney fans to like your music too, why don't you start listening to something other than Modest Mouse!"
2,underwhelming,"I bought this CD with high hopes. However, after several listens (I tried to give it a chance), those hopes were dashed. The lyrics were killing me. I do not neccesarily prefer poetic or abstracted lyrics, but it kills me when a band appears to take itself so seriously but cannot verbalize its ""philosophical insights"" in any meaningful way. The lyrics are, at best, amateurish and juvenile, reinforcing my conviction that the only reason some bands get popular is because of this lack of depth (aka accesibility). And ""Good News..."" is definitely accesible- even to the 13 year old girls I saw buying the album at Walmart."
5,"Very Good, Still Fresh","There are plenty of rock snobs out there who will stop listening to awesome bands when they become remotely popular. Well they're missing out.I think that this is one of the most compelling, fresh sounding albums of 2004, and I congratulate MM for theY're commercial succes. They're also brave enough instruments and sounds that would soun ""folky"" if it weren't for the bands talent.PS- I like that fishisfast reveiw."
3,I don't get it.,"Why is there such a fuss over this record?Yes, there are some really solid tracks, but a lot of it just seems like songs they would have cut from ""The Moon & Antartica"" (which is phoenominal by the way).I like Modest Mouse a lot, but this should not have been the album that broke them publicly and made them a sensation. This is probably the worst record they've released.Buy ""The Moon & Antartica"", then buy ""The Lonesome Crowded West"" and then buy the Ugly Casanova CD (which is pretty good) and then buy this."
2,3 good titles - only,"I am not a harsh critic usually, but this album has 3 good titles and the rest is a crack-induced carnival of hell. It is like a bad dream"
1,Music in the buck,"One reviewer below suggested you need to be on drugs to enjoy this album?!!! Dude - with 5 stars I would have thought you would say something more positive about the music!?So minus having to monkey with the funny stuff - is this just plain good music or not?Well, you gotta decide that for urself... but you might want to try before you buy on this one. ;) You will thank yourself later, I promise you!"
2,Some new directions for the Mouse,"From good music to occasionally good, and from completely depressing lyrics to mostly depressing lyrics. The result is a CD that sounds a little more ""up"" in general, has gathered a lot more radio play for the couple good tracks, and then flops quite badly for the rest of the CD.I love a band where every track is a new sound. Some bands find a way to make those new sounds all work together into something that makes for a coherant CD... this degenerates into a frankenstein mix with ugly results."
2,where's the songs?,"Like the majority of casual music listeners i bought this for ""Float on"" which is a gem, but the rest of it is really lacking. It's like the band just got lazy and didn't bother finishing the album properly, or is that what indie music is about? I'd really like to know what people see in this album thats so great. The music is forgetable and the lyrics strive to be clever but are mostly lame. So what else is there?"
1,Yawn,"Why Modest Mouse shouldn't be as big as they are:Exhibit #1: Modest Mouse bought its sound, lock stock and barrel, from the now defunct Portland OR band, Pond. What Pond did brilliantly, Modest Mouse ruins with trite lyrics and uninspired musical craftsmanship. Boring. Save you money and invest in Pond's three releases.Exhibit #2: Everyone's the ""first"" to have discovered Modest Mouse. This is extremely annoying and, yes, boring.Exhibit #3: Never listen to bands that you commonly see emblazened on coffee house denizens in Seattle. This is the law.Exhibit #4: Just because the college kids are listening to them, does not make Modest Mouse ""ironic,"" ""smart,"" ""groundbreaking,"" or any other adjectives your dorm-mate spouted when they, in a marijuana-induced moment of false-epiphany, attempted to impress you with their knowledge of the ""local scene.""Exhibit #5: The Shins suck worse than Modest Mouse. This does not make Modest Mouse any better, I just wanted to get in a dig at The Shins."
1,What happened to this brutal death metal band?,"They used to have such a crushing, organ-churning metal sound that metal knew no equal. Their sound is still brutal, but no where near as heavy as before. The best underground metal stations like K-rock in LA still play their songs, but I don't think that the mainstream metal public is buying it! In addition to his own band, lead singer Jimmie ""Modest"" Mousecowitz has lent his blood-curdling death metal grunts to such death metal bands as Cannibal Corpse and thrash bands like The Crown and Grimfist, but on this CD he has really toned it down. The blazing dual guitar attack is still present and the drums still resonate with pounding double-bass and blast beats, but overall the songs have less punch.Modest Mouse, go back to the sound that got you to where you are today - no-holds-barred metal brutality!"
1,worst music ever,"The best way to describe this album is by comparing it to when you burp and puke comes into your mouth. If you like Dexy's midnight runners, grab this album! Guitar riffs are painfully catchy and get stuck in your head (just like the Proclaimers ""i would walk 500 miles..."") Vocals are as friendly on the ears as a 3 month old screaming in a movie next to you. Drums are so simple they sound like someone pushed play on an old casio keyboard (the little ones with only 2 octaves). I would have sold this cd on ebay, but instead I put it in the microwave for 4 seconds and made a neat design out of it. Try it sometime...it stinks up the microwave, but worth it!Since the scale doesn't go negative, i gotta give this album a 0/10."
1,Huh?,"Looking at this band from a purely musical perspective, I was overwhelmingly disappointed. Hearing their songs repeated endlessly on the radio stirred up as much confusion as I felt back when ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" flooded the radio. I don't think this band has a great deal of vocal talent, and the melodies they employ only emphasize this. The worst instance of this has to be on ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" when the band sings a capella and instead of being a fun break (like I'm assuming it was intended to be), the vocals sound more off-key than fun. The lyrics are, in general, lacking in creativity. They DO try to be creative, but it usually fails. My advice is to steer clear of this album and try a group with a little more substance (talent)."
2,Bad news for people who like bad news...,"The bad news is, this music is overrated. ?Best of 2004?...then 2004 must have been a bad year for music...in fact it was a bad year for the most part. I am usually alined with the thoughts of critics concerning the 'best music currently out there'. But this piece falls far short of my personal expectations for great music. MM is often quoted as being exceptional, unique or original. I have heard nothing new in Bad news...It's not original. It has all been done before and to a higher level than MM attains on this effort. Moreover, if this was compared to the music in past years it would not get a second look. But hears the good news, 2005 is going to be a great year for music...look for new albums from EELS, Nine Inch Nails, Coldplay, Mike Doughty, The White Stripes, Dave Matthews Band and Bruce Springsteen...then pick up the new U2 and Beck if you have not already."
1,Not good at all,"ONLY buy this if you have listened to it and really like it. I bought this based on ""other's"" views. This is the worst CD of 2004 and back 100 years!"
1,yuck,"I know Modest Mouse better than you do sh-shah, sh-shah! My son is 15 years old and cooler than Miles Davis, and that is all he listens to. They, he, whatever, wouldn't be so bad if they would tune their guitars, take some voice lessons, and check into re-hab. Sometimes I think I'm listening to a stretched cassette tape playing under water or somebody gargling in a blender."
1,Someone Shoot me....,"I swear to God, this is one of the worst bands I've ever come across, right next to the white stripes and franz faginand. Trendy radio trash, garbage w/ a british accent, and MTV's new favorite obsession (if that doesn't tell you to run far away, nothing will). This band, along with the others I've listed and a few extras like My chemical Romance, the hives, the vines, the violent femme's, denver harbor and Underoath should all jump into river and drown and die."
1,Th1z CD sux0rz,"1 4m 4 r0b07, 1 74lk 1n r0b0t sp34k, and 1 c0m3 fr0m 7h3 pl4n37 r0b07r0n. 7h1s cd i5 v3ry b0r1ng, 1 sh0uld kn0w, 4nd wh1l3 m0d3st m0use u35d t0 b3 0k, th3ir mus1c 0n th15 4lbum i5 teh sux0rz, 1 0n th3 0th3r h4nd, r0x0rz."
3,"eh, you know, there it is","This album is pretty OK. Sure ""Float On"" is a pretty catchy song, but what about the rest of the songs? They lack the ability to create melodies that differ from one another. The music they wrote for each song is obviously different, but the melodies are one in the same. I heard ""Float On"" first and decided to give them a try and then I heard the first song on the album and the melody sounded very similar to that of ""Float On."" This band could be good, but they need some work to get there, and I know they've been around for a little while already, but there it is."
4,Greatest band ever,"I am proud to say i knew about Modest Mouse about 3 years ago, before they were introduced to the public with their new single 'Float On'. I like this cd a lot, but i would have to say it is not even close to their best album. That doesn't mean this one isn't good, it is great, but to fully understand Modest Mouse you have to listen to all of their stuff because they are a band that tries to say something, and does a good job doing it. If you found out about Modest Mouse on the radio from their single i would recommend you to start with the album 'The Moon and Antarctica' which is their best album. They are an excellent band that deserves to be noticed and everyone should see them live also."
2,I just don't get it,"O.K., so everyone told me to buy this and listen to it...which I did, several times on several transcontinental flights-force fed myself this disc like it was musical cod-liver oil. I'm a sucker for the ""You've GOT to hear this band"" mentality. I just don't get it - I find scant little that's even remotely listenable (from someone who really likes the releases from The Shins, Broken Social Scene and Elbow, not to mention Sigur Ros) but this is pretty crappy even on a sunny day with your best gal at your side. Unless you hear something/know something I don't, hold on to your cash or hope your CD shop doesn't take VISA or something. Fool me once shame on you...."
3,Slightly Over Rated...but good,"Like many, the first song by Modest Mouse I heard was ""Float On"". And I loved it. So I rushed out to buy this album. But to my surprise...it wasn't as grand as i hoped. Don't get me wrong...it's good....but....very over rated. Some songs are great....even put off a pixies/toadies vibe ""Bury Me With It"". But then again some of this is just artsy noise/crap.If you've heard their REAL first c.d....it was junk. So this is a big step up from back then. The talent is there....and they have good lyrics. But I guess it's not for everyone. So if you're gonna buy this c.d. because you liked ""Float On"" think twice...and maybe buy the single...but if you're gonna be risky and take a chance on these guys go for it. You may or may not be dissappointed..i was, but only slightly."
5,A deservedly 5 Star band.,"My idea of new music, especially in terms of alternative, are bands like The Hives, etc. so I am admittedly out of touch with today's music. I grow up on the New Wave and Punk of the 70's and 80's. The more I listen to this band, the more I love their music. This is definitely one of my favorite bands for the past 20 years. This, like all of their albums, is great. It's a great starting point for this band if you're new to their music."
5,Vinyl Edition Review,"This is a great album! So many variations in style from song to song, just a great album to listen to. The vinyl is perfect and sounds great. The packaging is also good, would have preferred gatefold over both vinyls in the same sleeve, but, they do fit properly. Great addition to any collection.Shipped from Amazon, packaged correctly with no bends or warping."
4,first impressions,"I had no preconceived notion of what either this album or Modest Mouse in general sounded like. A few college-rock friends of mine have been into them for years, but i don't think I ever heard them before this CD. I acquired a copy and randomly selected the sixth track, Bury Me With It. This is not at all what I expected. I expected more dreary than angry. Regardless, great song. The rest of the album doesn't really sound like this song, but that's not a criticism. I'm told 'Float On', which sounds like a lost 80's gem, is a radio single (I wouldn't know, if you catch my drift). I hope they can stay themselves because I know that they have an impressively large following that didn't come from mainstream radio play and video exposure. Check the CD out and give MM a chance, for sure."
4,$$$$$$ for Modest Mouse,"This is one of the few indie bands I actually got in on the ground floor on, but I don't mean to go down that ""I-knew-them-when-they-were-underground"" road...Modest Mouse has been making amazing, inventive music going on ten years now, and have finally produced a more accessible album.I've always loved Isaac Brock's clever lyrics (try listening to the Lonesome, Crowded West and the song ""Broke"" & Moon and Anartica's ""Cowboy Dan"" for further examples). I was stoked to find that while they still maintained their unique vibe, they've also created music that is fit for prime-time MTV. Everyone should have known about this band years ago. I'm glad that we're all caught up now.So please, give this band your money for ""Good News for People Who Love Bad News."" It's hypnotic. And while your at it, buy every other album they every recorded. They deserve it."
3,What has happened to my beloved Modest Mouse,"Okay, this isn't terrible. In fact, if I had never heard Modest Mouse before I might kind of like this, but having been a fan of theirs from the beginning I find myself disappointed. I'm glad to see them getting some mainstream success - they deserve it- but I'm sad to see them getting it from this album. This is a watered-down version of Modest Mouse. This is the Modest Mouse minus the spark that made them great. There is something intangible missing from their sound. Buy ""The Lonesome Crowded West"" or ""The Moon and Antartica"" before this album."
2,Moderate Mouse - not a terrible purchase,"Great coupla singles, rest of the CD is not bad either. While I agree the lyrics tend to overdo it on the rant and whine side - the music is good (in spots). The band definitely seems to be experimenting - and on a future album that may pay off enough to fill most of a CD with great tracks.I guess if I liked mainstream a little more I would enjoy the CD as a whole. Same as previous reviewers wrote, if Britney fans etc. like this music so much, I'm happy for them... for those hardcore MM fans who object I guess thats their problem. ;)"
2,2 Album Curse,"There really seems to be a 2-album curse in the universe. Sure some bands release 8 great albums but so many seem to release a 3rd (in this case fourth) that completely falls short of everything that made the first 2 albums so perfect. If you loved the rhythms, changes and the sparse Santos and Johnny guitar lines of lonesome crowded west than this is going to sound like a car commercial to you. I'm really not an ""early craps the best"" type, I really wanted this to make up for Moon and Antarctica, I think it might be worse. I'm sure Float On could sell some Ipods and Jettas though."
2,Squish the mouse!,"I don't know what to say. I bought this album and after hearing it over and over, i cant find any other favorite song other than ""Float On"". Yes, the song before it is fine, and the final two songs are fine. But it is a deception in the sense that its just too weird. Some songs are just too wacky. The horns, trumpets get too wild and a combination of bad music plus the lead singer's voice is a complete catastrophy. All I know is that I wasted my money on this. I expected more catchy songs other than ""Float On"", but there are hardly any other than that one. They have some soft songs too, perhaps too soft. I would not recommend this album. Do NOT waste your money. Instead, download ""Float On"" and that's it."
3,OK but disappointing,"I am a really big modest mouse fan. I have all their major releases. I don't know if you can still buy their K record releases.The short of it is that this album doesn't come close to their previous albums. It's just not as good. And I seriously don't care if they sell out or whatever. I bought the album right after it came out and after seeing it advertised on commericials. I don't care.It's not the same band. The bad has changed over the years but losing the drummer was a devastating blow. The drummer made the music work. The new drummer is one-dimensional.So buy a Modest Mouse album. Just not this one. It promise, you won't be sorry. Antartica is a good one to start with. The best is Lonesome Crowded... but it might scare you off if you aren't prepared. First song is a little 'hard' if you want to call it that. Definitely pisses my wife off."
3,"Some ok, some awful.","For what it's worth the only song by MM I'd ever heard was float on. The DJ on the radio said that this was a great CD, and it received good reviews here, so I bought it.A few of the songs are good. A few of them are not very good, and a few are comically bad; I mean so bad that if somebody caught you listening to it you'd feel ashamed of yourself. Those who said that his vocals are annoying really hit the nail on the head. At first I thought that the lead singer's voice sounded like somebody with a well developed speech impediment, but upon further reflection I find his voice more akin to if you took that guy from the police academy movies (the one with the very, very annoying voice), and had him as lead singer.The CD is refreshing, I'll give you that, but refreshing isn't always good."
4,pretty iffy,"I'm a pretty big fan of Modest Mouse and I can say basically that this new CD is a step in the wrong direction. It seems that they've gotten bored of making the type of music they had with Antarctica. The brass band, and random screaming of dance hall, is just not very good quality music. Another thing that i'm not very happy about is the more pessimistic feeling of the whole album. It generally just depresses you rather than making you think. I'm sorry if I made this album look terrible, it's not;hence the rating. However, I recommend going for the Moon and Antarctica first, then Lonesome Crowded West, and if you still have cash to blow, buy this album. There was a lot of hype and I guess my expectations were a bit too high."
4,modest mouse still rocks,this is going to be a really short review cause there really isn't a whole lot to say. this is a fantastic album by a fantastic band. i've been listening to modest mouse for a long long time and i can say that they get better with age. they're one of few bands that i am actually really psyched has gotten big. big labels means big recording budget and that only means that modest mouse can basically do whatever they want on their next album!
4,is this the mouse?,"Whoa, I just like listened to the album and my jaw hit my carpet, man. I was like, ""Is this Modest Mouse?, Because it has a way different pitch quality."" I don't know if anyone else noticed but all of the songs were extremely high-pitched, my dogs were going crazy, especially on track 4.Anywho, this is different than their other albums but it still pleases with its Jon Bones-esque/neo-Neutral Milk Hotel tunes. Good use of trumpet on the circus tune. As for lyrics, the words still melt my heart and I can't help but think of them all the time...like, all the time! They're very meaningful, if you actually like make sure your ears are like open to hear their truths. I'll get off my soapbox now i guess but i think there is like a lot of guiding spiritual instruction on the record. By the way, the Mouse is way sick (even if they sold out)!!!"
5,i love it,"this is the first modest mouse cd i've heard, so i don't know how different it is from the others or whatever, but i loved it. My favorite tracks are the world at large and float on, but i really like all of them. the problem is really that it gets me kindof sad to listen to them, but not because i dont love them. great cd"
5,How can anyone not like Modest Mouse?,"Modest Mouse released their first cd in 1994.I loved it and all their albums up to this one.The cd opens up with WORLD AT LARGE, which takes you by surprise if you like MTV and you bought it for FLOAT ON.My favorites are BURY ME WITH IT,THE VIEW, and BLACK CADILLACS.This cd is great I've had it for over a month and it is still in my cd player now.THIS IS A MUST HAVE."
2,listen to this instead.. it's better,"I'm in the ""modest mouse old stuff is way better"" boat.if this is the only modest mouse album you have bought and were disappointed.. i feel you.. i recomend downloading these songs if you want to hear their better stuff..heart cooks brainlounge (closing time)convienient parking3rd planetgravity rides everythingtiny citie made of ashespaper thin wallswill suspention of disbeliefthese are my favorite modest mouse songs"
3,Modest Mouse sells out,"this new album is under mary-kate and ashly olsans ""hot new music"" section of their website. WTF?!?! modest mouse used to have a uniqe voice, but now their songs are being used for minivan commercials. this is still lightyears ahead of anything else on the radio but for anyone who loves The Lonesome Croweded West wont like the new sound."
2,Who are you and what did you do with Modest Mouse?,"I'm starting to think that departed drummer Jeremiah Green had much more to do with Modest Mouse's music than I previously thought. Well now the cat is away and the mice are playing, like a bunch of fartheads. If you thought Moon & Antarctica was over-produced, just wait until you listen to this catastrophe. It doesn't even sound like Isaac Brock singing! Is this a conspiracy?! This band now sounds like half bad Beatles wannabes, half Modest Mouse cover band. So disappointing! ARGH!"
5,For People Who Love Good Music,"Buy this album, listen to it a few times to get used to it, read the lyrics, and then pat yourself on the back for being a better person for it.This Album Is Absolutely Terrific. Modest Mouse said ""we can do whatever we want, and we're awesome, and who cares what anyone else thinks."" If anyone doesn't like this album, they're wrong. This album is not over-rated either, because it's great and if anything, more people should be talking about. If you don't like it, you don't know anything about music. The album hints at being themed, and it's little nuances show how much planning and effort went into it. The lyrics on this album are some of the best i've ever heard. Kudos, MM."
2,Aidin Vaziri is a dumbass,"""It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment Modest Mouse started sounding like a real band.""were they a fake band before? if anything they were more real before they started sounding like everything else. there's something positive to be said about questioning the 'established rules.' working on your own terms for what you believe in, instead of following these 'established rules,' is what creativity--the central nervous system of music--is; it is how steps forward are made instead of circling the same path forever.where would the human race be without the individual and our ability to think and act for ourselves? modest mouse's view on life is healthy, however those people like Aidin Vaziri who do not know how to live their own lives can go ahead and follow the flock of society."
3,Pretty good.,"Wow this is a good album. The first time i heard float on i could not hear the lyrics, but once i did i loved it. this is not an emo album like some will say. this is an alternative album. this is similar to the sound of a smashing pumpkins. this album may give alternative the shot in the arm needed to push it back into the spot light and get rid of the ""emo/punk"" fad once and for all."
2,Like one reviewer said...,"If all these people REALLY do like bad news, why are they so feakin happy they like MM? Yes, things that make you go ""mmmmmm?""Point in case one person who gave this 5 stars wrote ""it flows like a river of joy. Lyrics are insanely clever..."" Gad, who writes these reviews - band members?!! This CD may not be 1 star material, but 5 stars... com'n, seriously???? I still can't stop laughing at the ""river of joy"" comment, my sides hurt. That was good. Not to say that being a 10 year old girl (or having tastes to match), liking Britney and MM, and thinking the lyrics on this CD ripped off from other authors are ""insanely clever"" is bad... its just... well, a little sad. But each to his own I guess.The only thing I'd say to anyone considering this CD is borrow from a friend first and listen repeatedly for a few days. You will thank me for this advise, I promise you... as you take you hard-earned money and spend elsewhere."
1,Your kidding-right?,This music really really sucks! Float on has the most horribly put together music video I think I have ever seen. I will admit the background music is SEMI-catchy but the vocals are simply dreadful-painful even! I can not believe they play this crap on the radio! It sounds exactly like Franz Ferdinand-which is not a good thing! The yelling is not even music. There is no genre to classify this in considering it is not rap or classical or blues or anything. But it certainly is not rock or punk and is not catchy enough to be pop! I think this starts an all new genre called G-A-R-B-A-G-E! And not the band garbage either....
1,"Tells it like it is, music is sad xcept for couple songs","The music may be a little sucky sure, but the words and the cussing is awesome!!!Who cares is this album is some wierd mix of indie and radio-hype... these guys are hatin life and say it.While I could not honestly say the music is good across most of the tracks, I gave these guys a point for attitude."
1,Just a Warning...,"I must say that while I love many kinds of music, varying from jazz to electronica, to rock, I hate modest mouse. This record, while found good by some, is a work that I feel certain people just need to avoid as if it were a highly dangerous life-thretening disease. To my ear, the vocals are what really kills this group, with the lead singer's singing style grating on my ears with every word. What i'm saying is this, give it a listen before you buy it. If you think the singer sounds as bad as I do, give this one a miss, no matter what the current rating may be."
1,horrible,"I thought i heard a song by modest mouse that i liked...but then my friend let me borrow this cd, and it was the worsth thing i have ever heard in my life! i mean the guys crappy voice, the crapp guitar...basically everything in this bad is (...)...sorry to all the fans but it is true, music is failing terriblygo listen to something good."
2,sucky,"Personally, this cd is alright. I prefer their other cd's a lot more. They are way too overrated now. They used to be a little band, and now they are in the public eye, and on MTV, with music videos. Its disgusting. This band is ruined. And whats with these short little songs with trumpets? some even sound the same. Without Jeremiah this band sucks. I don't support Modest Mouse anymore, until they return to their old selves. Thats all I have to say."
3,indie rock? no way!,"exuse me, i am having a problemo. they are getting way too famous. indie rock???!!! indie rock my butt. they are on kidz bop 7, now 18 or 17, and they are played on popular stations. modest mouse's old stuff is totally unrecognized by the popular music stupids. modest mouse has crossed the line between indie and popular."
3,titles are for people who don't read the review,"I would have given it five stars, but I always skip the positive reviews to read the negative ones. If I don't like the negative review I generally buy the book, and this system works. I think a lot of indie music is crap, but modest mouse is good. I must admit this is the first modest mouse cd i have listened too, but i should get more for christmas. anyway the music is really weird, but good music generally is. I mean boy bands are very normal, and their music is crap. this cd is definitely worth buying, and this is coming from someone who does not like paying for music."
2,"It's definitely not good, but it's not THAT bad","Okay, I'm just going to come out and say it. I absolutely hate indie/minimalist/experimental rock. And Modest Mouse falls into that category.Why do I hate this album and the band? Because they lack musical talent. Their songs are painful to listen to because of the lack of musicianship. The singer CANNOT sing whatsoever. He sort of hits the notes and occasionally screams things, but is that singing? Definitely not. The guitar riffs are boring, pitchy, and annoying. The lyrics are completely worthless. They really write about nothing.That being said, this album could have been a lot worse, and I have heard a lot worse. I don't like it at all, but you know, whatever works for you. I'm sure that you could turn around and bash the bands I like so whatever. I'm saying I personally do not find this appealing whatsoever."
2,I don't get it.,A....to tell you the truth...I don't get it. The singer sounds like he is nuts...or going crazy. A little like a chicken being choked. Is this really a high rated CD? You have got to be kidding!
1,Bad news for people who love good news.,"I was watching Fuse when the music video 'Float On' by Modest mouse came on. I nearly went deaf by listening to his maniacly psyco voice. He sounds like a damn monster! 4 months later the tune to it gets stuck in my head. Float On may as well be the only song listening to on this album. But if you head my warning, I am ordering you to please not be one of the stupid people who have to listen to Modest Mouse day after day after day...Hell, I'd prefer Vannila Ice over Modest Mouse!!!"
2,modesto moose,"I have to say that despite the semi-cool guitar in float on, I cannot stand modest mouse. His voice is just not really there or here, becuase its all over the place, and its annoying. On top of that, this is not what I would call outwardly catchy music, its more of a - listen 3 or 4 times to the album and youll understand!- type of thing. So I suppose I would recommend this to indie, smart art, how-goes-it type people, who can be really annoying."
2,Recommend you listen to a friends copy 1st,"Must say I'm quite sceptical of the 5* ratings I see... this CD has promise, but just comes off a little hollow musically and lyrically speaking.You may like it (I doubt it), but at the very least I'd say try before you buy. I think you'll be happy you did not spend the money up-front is all I'm saying. ;)"
1,...,"It seems that the only good song on the cd is the one that was a single. Float On is a great song, but it's the only good one on the album."
3,"for eight dollars, I'm happy...","I'd like to start by saying that whoever priced this album to cost eight dollars was a genius because if i paid 15 to eighteen for it I'd have been less than enthusiastic. All told i have been a fan for years begining with my seeing them in d.c. at the black cat for the lonesome crowded west during college. Unfourtanelty i was a bit drunk to recall the finer qualitys such as sound and such. This album seems like a commerical waiting to happen which is logical in the evolution of a gifted artist such as brock. negatives, well the abscence of the original drummer is a loud and glaring ommision which should be taken care of. gone are the amazingly innovative use of cymbals and in is a more traditional use of rock percussion. I could be biased due to the fact that i am a huge fan of moon and parlor tricks. Otherwise buy the album and picture yourself in a minivan commercial looking cool and trendsetting, or buying clothes at the mall in abercrombie and finch."
5,please listen to this album,"I think Good News is a natural progression in Blocks' aimless life's narrative therefore it is definitley worth the listen to catch up on how his take on the world has evolved. It appears as though he's began to really accept himself for who he is and feel comfortable in his role as a catalyst. I think this album speaks directly to those of us, at this point in history, who are stumbling at the crossroads of keeping true to our souls vs. finally giving in. I sincerely feel that issac is my generation's bob dylan if he'd only go solo. Could you imagine his 'Tangled up in Blue' ten or so years from now?"
5,freaking awesome,"this cd is great. my favorite song is Black Cadillacs, its great. the only problem with it is that i cannot listen to it on my stereo because they say F**K so many times in that song. (they don't say F**K or Cruse thoughout the rest of the cd) just don't get in trouble for its langauge, check with your parents first."
3,New and not as good,This new cd by Modest Mouse has a new style to it. This cd does not sound anything like there old nor is it as good. I would recomend buying Lonesome Crowded West and This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About before you buy this. They are classic Modest Mouse cds.
4,Ahh Dear...,"After reading J. Bernbachs review of this Cd and totally agreeing with it... I continued to scroll downscreen, where i was met by MrBobGuy's 1 star review....Hmm.... You say you have an appreciation of bands with talent and then, when clicking on the ""Other Reviews By This Author"" button, i was met with your 5 star review of Relient K.........................Nuff Said...."
4,"A few great songs, a few good songs, and a bunch of filler","This is the first Modest Mouse album I have heard, and like most I was drawn in by the hit single ""Float On,"" which I think is a marvelous track. The video is even better if you have a chance to see it. That being said, being a new listener to MM, I'm not so sure what they are trying to do in this album. The songs don't seem to fit well together at times and the styles are plenty, which may be a good thing, but I haven't decided on that yet. Overall, there are a few really good tracks, mostly in the beginning, a few good tracks, and some stuff that I don't care for, particularly the filler in the horn intros etc. I think MM has something good going here and from this album I'm willing to try their others, it just wasn't as good as I had hoped."
5,great album,great follow up to their other stuff. Both the lyrics and riffs are smart and to the point. Again Modest Mouse pulls from so many sources and comes up with a sound that is uniquely and triumphantly their own. They are a blast of fresh air in a scene saturated with bands recycling whatever seems fashionable at the moment.
4,ha,"I agree, this is not MM's best release, but one must consider the previous record's release, four years ago. Over four years, a band will change a lot anyway, plus there's been a lineup change to consider. If you prefer no progression whatsoever, obviously you're extremelly boring and need to take a hard look at life. Things aren't going to stay the same just so you have a little more comfort, so you're a little more indier than every other human alive.I think this album is very credible. Go ahead and call me a fanboy or whatever you want, but this simply is not the case, as I bought their earlier releases after hearing Good News..."
3,Good Music for People Who Love Bad Music,"...Just kidding. It's not really bad but not nearly as good as their stellar album The Moon & Antarctica. There are a few really memorable tunes on here along with some duds. My favorites are ""Float On"", ""Bury Me With It"", ""Once Chance"", and ""The Good Times Are Killing Me""."
4,Underrated,"Modest Mouse has suffered from that universal accusation: ""That band sold out, man, i've listened to em 10 years nothing like they were"". It's true they are nothing like they were. The raw, unproduced tone is gone; their indie rock sensibilities have faded as well.Yet why is this bad? Who desires the same music over and over? Modest Mouse has shown its versatility and unwillingness to stagnate. Songs like ""Float On"" and ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" lend themselves to the pop radio stations over the country, but they are surrounded by mature, more developed arrangements: the absurd rage of ""Satin in a Coffin"" and ""bury me with it"". My favorite track is ""The Good Times are Killing Me"", where the band collaborated with The Flaming Lips to create a soft-spoken anthem of regret and sobriety.Modest Mouse has proven its worth."
5,Cool Tool,"This is a great hand held cultivator - strong so you can really dig out those weeds and loosen up the soil around a plant without tearing it out, longer than most so you don't have to reach as far, comfortable in the hand and easy to use without over using the back muscles. Definitely puts my old one to shame."
2,WARNING: Not a Real Van Compilation,"If you're looking for an intro to Van the Man, don't start here. There is no Moondance, no And It Stoned Me, no Sweet Thing, no Madame George (at least not the familiar version), no Cypress Avenue, no Domino, no Tupelo Honey, no Wild Night, no Jackie Wilson Said, no Gloria. Essentially, this is an excuse for Bang Records to cash in on Brown-Eyed Girl. These tapes have been reissued over and over again in a million different formats since their original release in 1968. The REAL best of Van Morrison, twenty songs long and containing all of the aforementioned songs but Tupelo Honey plus a few more, makes for a good intro, plus Astral Weeks is nothing short of mindblowing and Moondance is good. Buy those instead."
5,Best of Van Morrison,Good music to sing along with when driving. Loved it. Van Morrison is someone that is easy to listen to and you get carried away with the songs.
4,A Chilled Mix Not To Be Missed,"This CD caught my eye as interesting. Upon listening to it, I bought it. I can say that every track is different and unique, bringing an ambient cool to your ears. It's not the best of the best, but it comes quite close."
3,Ok Game - but not too exciting.,"It's a fun game, and the kids play with it. But definetly not that great. It pretty much is the same driving course, with different math questions.Good if you child is a Cars Fanatic. But I highly recommend Sonic over this one for 5 - 6 year old. If you child is younger - maybe 4 - than this would be appropriate."
4,Leapster Toy,My grandkids jumped with joy when they opened this toy for Christmas. They said it was exactly what they wanted. They left the room then to go play with it. No complaints from grandma - it kept the kids happy.
5,Hmm,"For Christmas of 2010 I had gotten my nephew who is 4 a Leapster 2 in green, and 3 games. The cheaper games I could find on Amazon.com so i had the power to get him a few games instead of just one. This was one of the games I had purchased for him. Now, I cant tell you how much he actually gets out of it. He's young. he isn't in school yet, he may not actually understand the games yet... But he does run and hide in the corner with his Leapster 2, and sit there with his game, and little pen, all smart looking, and he plays for hours. He enjoys it. Hours of enjoyment. I just cant tell you how much he is learning from it, since he's still a little young.I'll see if I can get a video the next time I visit him."
2,needs to be older,"if you are thinking about buying this for a child under 3 it's a waste of money. I konw it's for children 4+ but we thought it would be ok, wrong! my son gets upset with the game and I don't see any educational value at all. he will grow into the game but i think these games are WAY over priced and i think you could buy other systems that would last longer."
1,total waste of money,"i bought this game this morning for my 4 yr old son. wish i'd never bought it. it's a total waste of money. my 4 yr old son found it extremely boring and wanted to stop playing after 10 minutes. i tried it too and i have to agree with him. too bad you can't return the game once opened. my son doesn't want to play it anymore, so that's $30 down the drain. we are extremely disappointed. not sure now if i want to buy any other leapster games."
4,Great Gift Idea,My son loved it for his 5th birthday and he has already learned so much. The game teaches math skills and they get to race. All a kid would want.
1,How Bad It Gets...,"Re-records/Poor live versions included here. Like Badfinger's 'Blue Baby', it's a live recording but sounds like it recorded 20 years after it was a hit. The vocalist sounds older and very rough. Listen to any original recording of this and the diff is like day and night.Groups like Scruffs, Shoes, Spongetones, Pezband, Paley Brother are such minor acts and had such little chart action, it's painful to have had to pay money for this music CD..."
5,reeds,They are sax. reeds. Great for my beginning daughter. No idea if they are good for others. We are happy with them and the price.
5,Good Sound,Bought these for my daughter beginning alto sax. Really liked the sound...sort of an extra hum or buzz that was nice. But they are more delicate at the tip and she cracked it the first day. I will save them for when she is more experienced.
3,Didn't prevent stretch marks for me,"This oil was recommended to me to prevent stretch marks, but I'm not sure if anything could have prevented them for me. I gained quite a bit of weight during pregnancy, and I'm naturally a petite person, so there was probably no way my skin could have stretched that much in a short time without leaving marks. In any case, I used this regularly during my pregnancy, and it definitely feels luxurious and smells great and helps relieve itchiness on your expanding belly, but it didn't prevent the marks. I do love this product just as a regular body oil, but I will probably not purchase it again because of the high price tag."
3,No Product Will Prevent Stretch Marks,"This oil smells nice and feels great. However, no product will prevent stretch marks. I had hoped this would and used it faithfully. I didn't get huge until month 8 and I had no stretch marks until then. This did keep my skin soft."
2,Didn't see a difference,I have been using this product for one month. I do not see a difference at all. I do not recommend.
5,A definitive guide for any entering into the airbrush art world,"Advanced Airbrush Art: How To Secrets From The Masters could also have been featured in our 'Transportation' section, for many of the techniques are demonstrated for auto art purposes - but it's reviewed here for its fine technical survey of airbrush techniques. Nearly 500 color photos provide step-by-step explanation to accompany projects from ten selected airbrush masters. The bikes being decorated serve as project examples for cutting masks, using graphics, mixing and more, making Advanced Airbrush Art a definitive guide for any entering into the airbrush art world."
3,Not for beginners.,"This book has some good techniques for someone who has some knowledge, but does not have any step-by-step projects for beginners. The step-by-step projects it has are for someone who has some knowledge and experience of painting and airbrushing. It seems nice for this purpose though. I wanted a book for an absolute beginners such as myself. I will keep the book and probably will use it after I learn some about airbrushing. I know some about painting so I can see how this would benefit someone with some skill and knowledge. It shows procedures and tips for painting gas tanks for motorcycles."
2,Wasn't What I Expected,"First of all, this isn't really a book. It's more like a magazine.Second, the airbrushing exmaples inside (while very well done) aren't what I expected.If you're interested in airbrushing a flaming skull on a motorcycle then this book (er, magazine) is for you.But if you're like me, and interested only in airbrushing illustrations, then this isn't for you."
3,Who titles the books and writes the ads?,"I think it's very good for what it is, but the things is I was not aware it was all about spraying motorcycle tanks. I was thinking,(the way the ads read), it was more generalized surfaces. They are professionally employed airbrushers, but they all have the same M.O., as most all air brushers do. So I guess I'm really rating the honesty of the advertisements here."
3,Fascinating subject told not shown,"Margaret Humphreys writes a devastating, true account of children who are yanked from their place of birth to be sent to populate the colonies, specifically Australia. Her story, and those of the migrant children, is captivating but is penned by an inexperienced writer who tells rather than shows. She uses too many cliches, her writing is repetitive, and there is little character growth in her eagerness to tell us the stories of these many, many deprived and forgotten children. The subject matter kept me going but I think a bit more editorial input, a bit more real writing assistance would have gone a long way to making this good, interesting read a truly great one."
5,"Exposes how Great Britain deported 150,000 children in foster care","After seeing the movie Oranges and Sunshine on Cox Pay for View, I knew there was even more to this shocking story. Great Britain, primarily in the 1950s, emptied their foster care system by exporting young children to Australia, Canada and other countries - placing them in orphanages and often abusive situations. This was done without the knowledge or permission of their birth families and with the consent of the government. This remarkable book, originally titled Empty Cradles, should be required reading for those dealing with a foster care system and anyone separated from their family members.Oranges and Sunshine"
5,Empty Cradles,Book was well written and poignant. It gave details the movie Oranges and Sunshine was missing. This is a very important topic and plays like it is out of today's headlines.
5,Nana's stories,"The book arrived on time and in exellent coondition. However I have not read this book yet but according to others who have, it is really very good."
2,Pretty good.... when it works.,"When I buy a hard drive, I know that it isn't a matter of if it fails, but a matter of when. Drive mechanisms have a finite lifetime, especially because of their moving parts. So, if the drive mechanism had failed in this drive, I would have understood. However, that's not what happened. Of all the things that could happen, the PATA - > USB/1394 interface board failed. Luckily, my data is safe on the drive itself. It's a wakeup call that I need a new external drive, however. I had this drive for just over two years."
4,Great,"It was worth it's money. My son is making beats , has his keyboard hooked up to the computer and he is maximizing it's potential."
1,The D in D2 stands for deficient data storage.,"I'll basically reinterate what everyone else who generously rated with item with a single star has written...that the LaCie D2 is a timebomb just waiting to lose your valuable data at any moment! I owned this Hard drive just long enough for the one year warranty to expire, then BAM! It dies and my data along with it! Now I'm faced with either shelling out more cash to have the data recovered, or just live with the fact that I've lost 60 GB's of info forever (professional photographs, artwork, and who knows what else). Regardless, I now have to replace the piece of junk, so I'm still going to lose money (and sanity) b/c I went with this product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
1,Avoid this if you have WinXP with SP2,"LaCie advertise this as being compatible with Windows XP. Nowhere on the packaging do they say that you should not use it if you have WinXP SP2. Let me put it bluntly: DO NOT BUY A LACIE DRIVE IF YOU USE WINDOWS XP WITH SERVICE PACK 2. ALL YOUR DATA WILL BE LOST. There is even a note on LaCie's support website advising you to not install SP2 if you use this drive - of course, you don't see that until AFTER the problems have materialized. I have had the 160gb version of this drive less than 1 week and all the data that I moved to it is gone. You have been warned!"
1,"Do not buy - Tough Exterior, Poor Guts","I continue to be dismayed why Apple pushes these drives. They are by far the most solid looking and feeling drives, but from a pool of about 20 drives that I have used LaCie's has the poorest reliability (this is not hyperbole). Two out of two of these are no longer functioning, LaCie can't fix them and never again will I rely on LaCie to backup any of my files, images, audio, video.So much of me wants this sexy, strong looking drive to work, but my experience and my conversations with other uber users make it clear to me that LaCie is not the way to go. Please ask around before you buy this drive or support this company."
2,Do they Test these things?,"I'm on my way to returning the second of these drives. The first LaCie 250gig d2... wasted five billable hours and a trip to the AppleStore-it had already wasted 3-4 hours of my client. The replacement drive has worked fine for two months. So I bought another one yesterday. Instead of going to work with it, I first tried to back up my Apple G4 internal HD. It failed twice bringing down the whole system both times.I ran Norton Utilities several times but it could not complete a check. The Apple OS 10.3.6 utility said it was OK but it wasn't. I couldn't erase the disk-who wants to drop off a harddrive with files still on it at a computer store?My opinion: Reliable when they work but probably not properly tested at the factory.LaCie at this point owes me 10 billable hours. I've had a lot of LaCie products over the years but haven't had or even heard of this level of failure for harddrives in ten years."
1,I will not buy another Lacie Drive,"Stopped working, have owned less than 6 months. I was using this as a Backup drive for my G4 Powerbook. Now I have to see if I can recover the Lost Data somehow. less than a year and it stopped working! Thats bad quality.In essenece the drive powers up but does not mount when rebooting or plugging in USB, or firewire cables. I went to their support page and performed the support steps with no luck.Tried differnt cables.Tryed to connect to my Dell Inspiron with Win XP as well. Will not recognize the drive.I want to throw it against the wall ."
1,Don't buy this product,"This drive looked great. The USB and FireWire combination gives you alot of flexibility. It was easly to setup. I used it to backup my data from 2 computers. After a month or so, I connected it to my computer - the drive failed - lost all my data. I thought this a freak occurance so, I decided to re-format it. I had 4 partitions with one being an NT partition. The drive was fine for several months. Then yesterday I tried to copy several large folders around 5 GB to the drive. After a few minutes I noticed the copy job was not progressing. I received an error message saying the drive had a hardware failure and the data was lost. I thought I only lost what I copied to the drive, but I lost all four partitions. The drive was not moved around and did not over heat.I went to the company website to look for drivers - didn't find anything to correct this problem. If anyone has more information on how to fix this problem let us know !"
2,Ramakrishna is seen as a human in this book,I dont think that there is any need for Ramakrishna Devotees to backlash against this book. This book is a sincere attempt at humanising Swami Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda.There have been several instances where Lord Rama in the Ramayana has been portrayed as nothing more than a Man and been debated.Such debates are healthy for literature and free thinking.The teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Swami Ramakrishna are the ones that need to be focussed as far as the devotees are considered. There is no need to backlash when the personality is being humanised from God.
4,pretty close to what I was looking for,"I am pretty near sighted, and I was looking for an alarm clock with big numbers. I get pretty tired of adjusting the time on the clock, so this time around I went looking for an atomic clock.This clock was pretty easy to set up, just put the batteries in, set the time zone, and it does all the rest. It set the time and date automatically.Now the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars. The clock is battery powered, not a bad thing, for an alarm clock, if you have a power outage, you don't have to worry about not getting up on time. But, I was looking for a clock that was lit up at night. That way if I woke up for some reason, I could see what time it was, and just go back to sleep if needed.The clock is back lit, but only when you push the button on the top, too much effort to find the time when I am sleepy."
4,one of the few worthy of working with Mr. R. Fripp,such a pleasure when an artist puts out quality performances that have not been----for the most part--available on a project such as this! I wish to thank David for using some thought to put together a lovely treasure of material-------little filler here. Looking forward to a remix of his live material ! someday soon please and thanx!
3,Exactly what the title says,"... but not the ideal introduction to D. Sylvian's work. It is flabbergasting to see just how varied the man's work is, and what wonderful collaborations are featured here (Fripp and Sakamoto, to name but two). However, you cannot have a 'best of' (which this is not) that has the style and consistency of his other albums. Want a good introduction to the man's work? Buy subsequently Alchemy, Brilliant Trees and The First Day. Bet you'll buy all the other ones soon?"
4,Visual stimulating with the best magazines online,"After you read the title, you expect exactly what the book delivers: excelent visual stimulation and the best magazine websites briefly analysed. Salon, Feed, Rolling Stone and all the best are there, both Internet-only mags and the printed ones with a cool version on the Web. Essential. It's impossible, even for the best and most experienced webdesign professional, do not like it. It's not the ""complete guide"" or something, but the 40/50 websites there are really THE ONES. A little over-priced, true, but you can consider yourself a lucky guy if you don't have the chance to put your hands on it: this book is one of those that once touched, it is immediatelly bought."
3,Strong and Bold flavor,"When I got to enjoy a cup of Kona on our vacation to Hawaii, I thought I was in Heaven. The smooth flavor was something to enjoy at any time of day or night. This Kona brand seemed very strong to me - I even tried not using to much coffee and more water and it still seemed too stong. I missed the smoothness and flavor of the Kona I remembered in Hawaii. For that reason, I do not think it's the same Kona I loved so much and would rate this coffee at a 3."
2,cute but ill fitting,they are cute but so narrow I couldn't get my feet into them.. I even purchased a size larger than normal..
5,Healthy alternative,"Pleasant tasting, crushes easily in grinder, dissolves readily in liquid. Pretty on table. Himalayan new fad; unsure if healthier than sea salt."
1,Just okay salt,"This is your standard Himalayan salt. I bought it for my mom and it is okay. If you want an excellent everyday salt, the best is Real Salt. You can buy it here on Amazon. Real salt is full of minerals and the flavor is EXCELLENT."
1,fooled,"I thought it was a game. It's only a keychain! It was very confusion when you saw the name display before you buy it. After you received it, you felt you were a fool."
1,Amazon cut off existing service when the phone SHIPPED,"BE WARNED! Amazon disabled my current SIM card (in my old phone) without warning when the new phone shipped. This meant that I was without a cellphone for the duration of the delivery. It was only a few days, but as the cellphone is my only phone, and I was expecting international visitors, it was a huge disruption. It is not possible for Cingular to reverse a SIM disabling, so despite a lot of complaining I was not able to get a phone during this period.Amazon's help staff were also completely useless -- I couldn't get their ""we'll call you back"" phone support service to work, and the email support staff I reached weren't able to understand the problem.The product has worked fine since; but I doubt I'll be buying phones through Amazon again."
1,No exchange available on phones,"I'll second the last review...beware buying a discounted phone from Amazon if there is even the remote chance you may end up wanting to exchange it for another model. Bite the bullet and buy it at the ATT store (or whatever carrier you have). Amazon blames ATT, they blame Amazon just like another reviewer said.As a long time Amazon customer I am extremely disappointed in them."
3,You get what you pay for,"He was cheap, and so I am quite satisfied, but I do have a number of complaints. The bones woere case of plastics of varying different colors, varying shades from creamy white to light grey with no consistency as to which bones are which color. Secondly he is very poorly put together, and seems quite lopsided, this seems to largely be due to deformities/compression in the rib cage. Holes are drilled somewhat haphazrdly, which adds to the confusion. The casting is quite off and there are many imperfections in the seams.Finally no sign of the ""free set of bone pens"".Overall though, all the bones are there and as artists reference he does the job. For the price I still think he was good value."
5,"Bright, Colorful, Grows With Your Child!","The bright colors and clear illustrations immediately attracted my two year old son. He flipped through the pages, identifying the numbers and pictures that he knew. As we read it together, I started to introduce the pictures that he was unfamiliar with, and some of the Hebrew and Yiddish words. As he grows, I can teach him more of the different languages, and read the Hannukah story with him. I think this is a beautiful book, one that my son will use and learn from for years to come."
3,Nice book with one problem,"The type is incredibly hard to read because of the background colors! Other than that, a nice little counting book."
3,Too much of an advertisement from someone so expert,"I was hoping for a lot more on business cycles. Instead it was mostly 'how great we are' and 'here is a little background on this statistic we provide our paying customers.'These guys may be great, but they did not tell any secrets here.I hope they write a follow up one that does.Geoffrey Moore rules!John DunbarSugar Land, TX"
3,A little less chest thumping please,"I like this service, their method and the results but I was a bit put off by the amount of time spent in this little book talking about how well they've done in the past without enough discussion of the methods they employ. Their focus on the data without any philosophical axe to grind is admirable. Their method provides a fine tour of recent economic history. It would have been interesting to hear a discussion of that history in the context of examining that data."
2,Infomercial for their web site,"I bought this book because of an article in the Wall Street Journal listing it as a summer reading pick by investment professionals. I agree with several of the other reviews that the book touts the authors' expertise in designing business cycle indexes. There is litte detailed explanation of their methods. The authors and their company may be good at predicting the turning points in the business cycle, but this book provides little detailed insight into that process. The book does allow you to receive a promotional three month free subscription to the ""light"" version of their their Recession-Recovery Watch weekly newsletter, which costs about $100 a year. I will continue to keep taps on their prediction performance."
4,To each his own...,"I for one liked this book. Sure I would have liked to know more about other indexes beyond the FIG and WLI (like more about the leading home price index) but that does not mean that the book is a wash. I now feel like I have SOME context within which to receive all the rantings of people/experts who have an axe to grind. Having spent time in academia I can see why some reviewers (frustrated academics?) are upset that the authors didn't give away their crown jewels. At least they seem to have gotten the juices flowing on the subject :-). As I understand the history they had to leave Columbia in order to keep the research going forward. That couldn't have been easy and I'm glad they did it. As for the title, gimme a break. If you buy every book based on its cover I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you."
2,An advertisement for ECRI rather than an economics book,"I'm disappointed because the majority of the book reads more like an advertisement for the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) than a book that can give you insight into actually 'beating the business cycle.' While a couple chapters reveal some of the methodology ECRI uses, the majority of the book deals with the history of ECRI?s founder, the success ECRI has had in predicting recessions and how ECRI clients use the service.I'm an admirer and user ECRI?s work. However, if your interested in learning about the business cycle, I would just go to their website and subscribe to one of their professional forecasting services."
4,Advertising literature sold as a book.,This is a good book though it repeats itself and does not go very deep. It tells which of their main indicators to watch but does not give away much of the secret to their system. WWW.businesscycle.com is the company that this book promotes.
1,Disappointing,"This book was huge disappointment. There was no theory, no math, no real explanation of business cycles, only stories of past successes. The final section on how to use the Weekly Leading Indicators and the Future Inflation Growth indicators was so simplistic and anecdotal as to make astrological columns more useful. Forget this one."
3,What are they doing writing books??,Authors seems to know their subject well and have looked up the concept of Leading Indicators well. Combine that with a good marketing idea. So that you have to buy their book to find out that you need to subscribe to their website to get the information. And even to find out how much the subscription is you'll have to send them an email.I wonder why their names do not appear next to Warren Buffet's if their snake oil is so good...They must be sure laughing to their bank off those who are paying up...
1,Have you ever PAID for a brochure?,"Look. They got tired of trying to explain to their customers exactly what their products are and how they work, so they wrote a book to educate and sell them. It's basically a hardback brochure. I'm sure they give it to all their hot prospects. But we the little people get to PAY for it.There is some useful info on leading indicators but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere free. And once they teach you which of their magic proprietary indicators to keep an eye on, guess what? You're supposed to sign up for a subscription to get them, not even the simplest of the data is available free althought the book implies they are.Booksellers need to stop carrying this kind of 'gotcha' book."
1,Beating the Business Cycle,"I was extremely disappointed in the book, as I expected to read about how to analyse the business cycle. I found that this is an extermely pricy advertisement for the service that these authors run. The promise on the cover of the book is that they are going to show how to predict the turns in the economy, however the method is to buy their service. I think that they have done a great deal of research and have found many good indicators, however, they didn't tell us any. Also, they failed to define what they mean by the terms they explain (like what a recession is) nor did they isolate root causes for a recession, thus their conclusions are tainted. After so much research, one would think that they could at least give the reader a few good indicators to work with. On the other hand, they did illustrate well the practical uses for the advance information that such analysis provides. I cannot recommend this book to anyone who is serious about business cycle research."
2,Beating the Business Cycle,Not expensive but not worth the time to read. A book of this size should clarify how they calculate their indexes. Jest of the book was trust our indicators because we are smart. Geoffrey Moore's books do a better job of illustrating what data ECRI's indicators are looking at in the economy. Over all very disappointing and not worth the time I spent reading it.
1,Didnt like it,"Just talk about how their system performed in the past, no useful insights for those interested on business cycle models"
3,"Does'nt reveal, but, is easy to read and use","While the book does not reveal the underlying metrics, it brainwashes you into believing that they work. The concept of a simple dashboard of WLI and FIG seems good, and is easy to use. Dont expect a serious book, this one is something you can read on the subway. Before buying the book would recommend that you go to the ECRI website (www.businesscycle.com), register for free membership and read the free research papers. Some of the research papers form chapters of the book!"
2,Little more than an advertisment for online services.,"I expected to get to understand something about the business cycle, its stages and how to find the signs of where we are in the business cycle by reading this book. Instead, to paraphrase this book, (a) There really is a business cycle and it isn't dead. (b) We (the Authers and our colleagues) invented the business cycle (c) You can get some hints about the current status of the cycle by going to our website and (d) you can get the real inside info by giving us money.Reading this book is not totally without value, but it is very repetitve and light on for content. It is not much more than a pamphlet."
4,"Works as advertised, good price.","First off, the device is very small, which is a great thing. I was expecting it be larger, but it no bigger than your palm. It works as advertised, it accepts SDHC and Memory Stick Pro Duo (the two formats I use which is why I bought the device) and for the price does the job pretty well. You do need an adapter to use Memory Stick Micro and MMC Micro cards. Everything else attaches to the device without an adapter according to the directions. One major plus is that it uses the standard mini USB port to attach to the computer, something you may already probably own. It also does come with a mini USB cable.My only drawback? The cable it comes with is too short to be practical for desktop use but then again it's designed to be used on the go."
5,Renegade,"I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she loves it. She thought it was the best present ever, because she saw it once on VHS and then never found another copy of it;She loves the Terence Hill/Robert Vaughn duo, especially the western/horse related ones.It would go nicely with the boxset that is available, because this is one of the movies that isn't on it.If you are into slapstick humour, you will like this movie."
3,different than I expected,"While this book had a lot of information, it was not exactly what I expected. I was looking for picture of each plant, not where I could purchase them to start my own biblical garden. I was able to use some of the written information"
3,Works OK,"Bought this sensor to control a night time security light with a CFL bulb. It works good, no flickering or problems normally encountered with CFL's and sensors. The sensor is not very sensitive to light. It comes on early and shuts off late. Should be mounted where the daylight can get to it easily."
4,long time ati user with zero problems,"i had this card and other ati cards before an upgrade and never experienced any problems like some of the other people have mentioned. this card along with all other ati cards ive used have always performed flawlessly and the fact that some of the other reviewers have ""fried"" their cards leads me to believe they either incorrectly overclocked them or installed them incorrectly in some manner.but problem occur across any product line but ive never had any with this item at all."
3,It worked,Its OK for an older card and it ran the program I got it for. In the end I just needed to upgrade my computer.
1,Piece of Junk,This video card had software issues from the first install. After trying to fix them and having it crash my PC too many times to count I sent it back.Finally I had to pull an NVidia 8MB video card out of an old PC just to any have video. That card worked better than the ATI X Radeon 9550 256MB AGP.I won't buy ATI again.Stay away from this and Tiger Direct. They made the whole thing MUCH worse with their hassle of a return process.
1,KEEP SEARCHING... YOU DON'T WANT THIS CARDBUS,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I BOUGHT A CARDBUS & THE FIRTS TIME I TRY THE BRAND""SYBA"". I USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 1 YEAR {windows xp) WITH: WIRELLES OPTICAL MOUSE, 3 IBM THINKPAD LAPTOPS, 4 USB PORTABLE DRIVEs 512MB, 1G. IT NEVER GAVE ME USB 2.0 ...AFTER I PLUG A 40GB PORTABLE DRIVE WITH NO AC CONNECTION THE CARD DIDN'T RECONIZED IT, DIDN'T HAVE SUFFICIENT ENERGY POWER. AFTER 3 TIMES TRYING IT MADE A FUNNY NOISE AND START TO SMELL LIKE IT BURNed. I LOST MY MONEY & ALMOST MY LAPTOP."
5,WOW! a great toy!,"I,(a GIRL) got this a few weeks ago, its awsome! The candy is great, I spent a whole day making things, and the gummys? You have to push down directly so that it all gets filled, and don't forget to cool it! Educational! I have fun substatuting new ingrediants and making my own recipies! If your age 10 or up you woln't need adult super vision. 10 or under, you might. I hope to get the drink lab soon. BUy it! It Rocks!"
2,Not worth the money,"My 6 year old son got this as a gift for Christmas and immediately wanted to make the ""food"". All the recipes for the gummies are basically the same, you just change the flavor to suit your taste. We never did find a flavor or combination flavor that he liked, and ended up throwing out all of the treats he made. The drinks were equally as bad tasting. There were no directions as to how to set up your ""lab"", just a lot of connector pieces that didn't seem to fit everywhere you wanted them to. As other reviewers stated, you need to have an adult there to help with the mixing. He grew bored with the kit, put it away, and has not asked to play with it again."
2,Waste of Money!!,My 6 yr old son got this as a Christmas present. It is disgusting!! The stuff is sticky and oozes out when it is setting. It isn't very tasty either. My son liked the gummies but there was some kind of drink that we poured down the drain. I have put it up and am hoping that he forgets that we have it!! The recipes are not hard to follow but pouring them into the molds and getting everything set up requires an adult.
2,A Lot of Mess for a little reward,"The kids had fun with this, but the goo is very hard for young kids to mix without making a mess. It starts to set very quickly so its hard to get enough out of the bowl and into the molds. It was okay, but definately not worth $25. My 6 year old has just as much fun playing with cheap spices and a bowl of water."
5,for every age,this is a quick comment.lets get this straight some people think that you have to be ten years old. what kind crap is that. this is for all ages. the only people that say that are losers.
1,awful product,I am a mentor for a 3rd grader. He spent Christmas Day in the ER with an allergic reaction to this product that his parent bought for him. I am surprised it is on the market.
5,Great book,"I teach 5th grade and used this book when teaching about archetypal characters. My students and I both loved this book! This Cinderella story was creative and kept the students interested. The illustrations were fantastic. I am taking the book home to read to my three and a half year old who I know will just love this book, too!"
5,A Mexican Fairytale,"Adelita is a Mexican Cinderella at the mercy of her cruel stepmothers and stepsisters. You know the story. The difference is that Mr. de Paola uses Mexican culture to breathe new life into a often tired old story. The result is a beautifully witten and illustrated adaptation rich with language and culture that makes it a true joy to read to my little ones.My four year old daughter loves this story and has me check it out from the library over and over again. (I think it's time to buy her her own copy.) I especially love reading the Spanish phrases which not only educates, but makes the story even more authentic. You will enjoy this tremendously."
1,lame,"White Mansions is still one of my favorites, but Jesse James is weak and predictable following the same pattern of the earlier work. Don't waste your money of the this one, just stick to WM."
4,Legend of Jesse James,"I had heard of this album in 1981 or so. Although I have the LP I wanted theCD also. I really like the story telling aspect of this cd. Starting with thefirst tract completely through the last. Also, the caliber of the singersincluded really pleased me. Charlie Daniels, Johnny Cash and Levon Helm'svoices are so well suited for the characters that they portray. It also mademe interested enough to do a little history reading on the real Jesse James.History would be a lot more interesting to people, I think, if more werepresented in such a well done way."
1,Sonoma SNOB style,"They desperately need to do an ""new and improved"" edition of this book as I felt it was severely outdated and quite ostentatious. My hobby is home remodeling and I got ZERO inspiration from this book. I was in the market for a Sonoma County property at the time. It's not even that pretty as a coffee table book!"
5,Sorry Boys... This case is too strong.,"Length:: 5:53 MinsNag Hammadi Scriptures, The: The International Edition"
5,Theologians are so credulous,"Loren Rosson's praise of Carlson's book is typical for the theologicla guild. Carlson's book is far from convincing. Rosson elsewhere wrote: ""I don't think there will be many defenders of Clement's letter after Carlson's book becomes widely read. If there are, there's a big problem in academia."" Exactly the opposite is true.It is rather funny to see the theologians lamenting over the document and writing and writing without actually go out for the physical object. It's telling."
5,Truely Meaningful,"I know...I was skeptical at first,too.Although I enjoy Jolie's movie career, I neglected to take her seriously. But, this actually made the book more accessable. I figured if a pampered Hollywood actress had the guts to take all this in, I could at least read what she had to say.After reading these journals on one sitting, my view has changed! Not only on Jolie but the world and our part in it.HIGHLY RECOMENDED BOOK. It's easy for anyone to understand, facts are brief and to the point. The accounts are gut-wrenching yet managable. Jolie is fairly non-biased and unassuming. The text is interesting and quick to read with chatty, personal style. These events and lives hit home! This book is for anyone trying to understand compassion.The only criticism is-What now? There is no purpose but to share what she's seen. But,WOW, do I thank her for sharing!"
4,The Refugee Situation from Angelina Jolie's Experience.,"Okay, so I should admit that the only reason I decided to read this book was because of my undying love for Angelina Jolie, but after reading about her experience it makes me admire her even more. She blatantly admits she's not a writer and that this book is just her short thoughts on what she saw and felt in the refugee camps. It's truly an eye opener. I had no idea how terrible some refugee camps conditions were. I definitely appreciate all of Angelina's humanitarian work. Angelina tends to be straightforward about everything. She isn't trying to add any Hollywood glamour. She wants the readers to know the truth. This journal is very inspiring; it actually makes me feel guilty that I haven't been able to make any sort of difference for those less fortunate in the world. I'm happy that Angelina can use her status as celebrity to shine light on this subject. I can honestly say without this I would probably still be oblivious to the situation."
5,Excellent read for people who wish to travel to help other countries,I will be taking a trip to Haiti at the beginning of next year to help the people there. I seen this book and I love Angelina Jolie so I purchased it. It has actually help to comfort me in my trip to Haiti and it has taught me a lot about the countries she has traveled. Excellent read!
4,A story that everyone should read....,"If I had to sum this book up in one word, it would be perspective. After reading this book. I realize just how very lucky I am. If your in a place where you feel like your life is kicking you around, read this. There are so many people in the world that are suffering horribly and still manage to smile through it all. It was a real wake up call. I am going to give my thanks every day for what I have. This book was very moving and at times brought tears to my eyes. I have the utmost respect for Angelina and all she has done to help the refugees of the world. We can all learn from her example. All the people that continually trash her should read this book."
5,Beautiful writings and incredible experience,"Everybody may think that Angelina Jolie's travels are always in very nice and expensive hotels and taking 5 thousand dollars relaxing baths and massages, but they're really not, what she does is help people and that's a very beautiful thing she does.The way she wrote all her experiences in this book is very beautiful and pure, and not trying to make this a huge best-seller book or the best criticized book in history, but this really lets us see the beautiful and safrificed life of Angelina Jolie. A wonderful experience she wants to share with us, and it's actually something that a regular person wouldn't do, but this huge Hollywood star does. What a great lesson she gives us in this book."
2,"well, she is pretty... that's all she has going for her","yep, that's right, i said it! Angelina Jolie is pretty, and kind of course, but that's all she has going for her in this book. She just CANT WRITE! its boring! its like reading someone's log or the weather report. for a couple of the pages its really a page turner, for the rest, its a blah blah blah way to make some money... dont waste your time on this."
2,Not New! as stated,"This book is in pretty good shape considering it's not new; however, I don't appreciate seller's dishonesty."
4,Amazing,"At first when you pick up this book, it is hard to imagine that it might be anything worthwhile. After all, it is written by an actress who could not possibly understand the hardships and struggles of people worlds away. This is quickly disproved by Jolie's book.Her raw accounts of everything she saw tugs at the heart strings and paints the pictures of the lives of people's living in the worst humanitarian conditions. Her love and heartbreak and present on every page, and her willingness to learn and help is something that we can all learn from. Jolie's book allows stories that may not otherwise be heard to see the light of day. A book that everyone should read because it teaches that one person can make a difference and that our problems are really not as big as we might like to think. I strongly recommend this book. She has seen for us a world miles away that needs our help, and reading this is the first step to realizing that something must and can be done."
4,Excellent sound quality,"With these speakers,you could hear even a pin drop noise. Crystal clear sound quality. I enjoy listening in a low volume. Excellent product"
2,Not Happy,"I purchased these speakers mid October and as of December 28th ive had trouble with them.It seems as though the volume control is malfunctioning,i must play around with the volume control in order to get both speakers to work. I am not happy with this purchase and i will look to another brand in the future."
2,they sound cheap,Not worth 100 bucks im packing them back up and returning them after only having them for 5 min. I was expecting a LOT more from Bose and for my money. They sound like some cheap 19.99 off brand computer speakers. They look nice though.
4,loose cables,The sound is great on my bose speakers but you have to twist the speaker cables a certian way to get sound in both speakers kind of a pain
4,Bose Companion 2 Speaker System,For $99 you won't find a better buy on computer/multimedia speakers. The sound is excellent with very good range. The packaging is very good attractive and having two audio in ports is key. I can connect my IPod and my computer to the speakers. Another nice touch is all the cables are included. Very happy with this purchase.
2,over priced,Sounded nice when I was at Target and then after I received the speakers from Amazon I realized that my old $30 speakers sounded better. Granted my cheap speakers have the big woofer(?) speaker on the floor. If you only want something for your desk top then these speakers may work for you. I liked that you could have two different inputs going into the speakers so in addition to my computer I had a radio also plugged into them. I was able to listen to the radio and still hear my computer sounds through the speakers which is why I bought them. In the end having an inferior sound and paying $100 made me decide that I'd return them for a refund. I'd avoid and check out other brands.
3,good sound but remember.... made in China,"Good sound, as expected from Bose.Just disappointing to find out that these are made in China.Bose in China. Just sad."
3,Good sound but...,"I replaced a pair of JBL Pro computer speakers with these, expecting the ""bose"" difference. These sound very nice at lower volumes but when you turn them up (although they do not rattle) the bass has some sort of automatic cutoff - it makes everything sound like crap."
5,Great sound. Best tabletop speakers for ipod,This speaker sounds great. This is the best alternative for Bose SoundDock for ipods. I agree that this is expensive when compared to other 2.1 speakers from other brands. I am happy with its performance. Listen to some guitar songs with this speaker and you will definitely like it. Off course everyone has their own opinions. This is my opinion.
2,"Flat, average sound","If you're looking for speakers to attach to your laptop, skip these and invest in a 2.1 speaker setup with a sub-woofer.For the price, and the fine Bose name, these speakers were just a little better than the speakers that came with my laptop.They have nice high and mid-ranges, but there is glaring lack of any bass response. Without out that, my music sounded dull and uninteresting.I'm sure they could have done better, especially for this price."
1,Don't Believe The Hype...,"I bought these speakers thinking that they would provide above average sound for playing MP3's, POD streaming, etc...These speakers sound like they have a wet towel sitting on top of them!! I'm currently trying to find an EQ download program to try and adjust them to something I can tolerate. I'm a Bose fan but I am very dissapointed..."
1,Bad luck? Bad QC?,"They looked pretty cool, they were heavy and sturdy, and the sound was OK (nothing marvelous, but OK). I enjoyed them for a week... Until they stopped working, unless I used them with my headphones. But why would I want computer speakers that only work with headphones on, if I simply can connect those headphones directly into my computer?Drag, isn't it?Short story, I returned them.I think they're having trouble with their Quality Control.Sadly, everything Made in China is like that: sometimes you're lucky and end up with something lasting for ages, and sometimes you're not lucky and end up with something that last 3 days.This time the second happened to me.Well, apart from having our jobs outsourced, the imported stuff we're buying ain't the national stuff we used to buy, and that applies to everything, from clothing to electronics, and sorry to say... even to Bose speakers.Pity."
1,Terrible sounding speakers for the price,M-audio AV30's destroy these Com 2 speakers. This was another Bose system I got home and tried out for a couple days and found the sound quality disappointing enough to promptly return them.Compare these garbage speakers with Cyber Acoustics or M-Audio or Sony bookshelf speakers with a T-amp and all of them blow these Bose POS's away.I own all the speakers I just mentioned.
2,Not worth the money for sure,I had very high expectations but what a let-down. The only thing different between these Bose speakers and the $20 speakers that I bought at office depot is that there is a little more base. Hardly worth $100 for that. I was very disappointed but I'll keep the speakers as I am too lazy to package them up for return.
3,2 years of ownership,"I bought these speakers aprox. 2 years ago for $99.99. Sad how the price has not gone down. I lost the power cable in transit, so they are portable speakers. Past 50% volume the bass seems to drown out the treble. I will not be purchasing these speakers again. Im going for cheap."
2,Bose Companion 2 Series II,"The left speaker didn't sound good, and quit working after using it for three days.Amazon was amazing at the ease in which a refund was handled."
2,"good sound, BUT...","... when powered on there is a very slight hissing sound, like a static sound, even when no audio cable is attached. When you hear music it isn't a problem, but when it is very quiet and no music is playing it is noticeable. I talked to BOSE, they say it is normal, all Companion 2 and 3 do that. Well, my cheap $20 speaker doesn't do that. Nor does my Logitech do that. Not acceptable, I sent it back.Besides that I like the BOSE sound and design."
2,Too Expensive for what you get,I like electronic music and that genre leads to incredible sound opportunity. These speakers have terrible bass and treble at high volume. I love Bose products but these are not worth the money.
2,Bose made these??,"For Bose the sound quality is very poor. There are sympathetic vibrations in the housing for many frequencies that are in the common range for both music and voice. At first I thought it was the surface I had them on but after placing them on the same pads I use for my studio monitors it is confirmed, the housing of the left channel actually rattles. I am very disappointed with this Bose product. In addition the audio cable is attached to the left channel, if a male to male mini-phono was used it could be replaced when the cable wears out."
1,They Literally Stink,"I am returning these today. They have a horrible stench that two different odor neutralizers and baking soda has not touched. I've had them airing out for a week now and I can't stand to be in the room with them. I've got them boxed to go back and I am still smelling them. My husband isn't as bothered by them, but he sits across the room from them while I am right next to them while working at the computer. The stink extends out about 3-4 feet. I looked at the box and it does say in teensy-weensy print that the product has chemicals and phalates known to create birth defects and reproductive harm. Made in China. These are clearly defective, as no one else has complained about this, and it's not a stench you wouldn't notice. As far as sound, not bad. Not great. OK for computer speakers. Little pricey for the actual quality. Even if they were free, I can't do the stench anymore. I've had a low grade migraine since I opened the box."
5,AWESOME Product!!,"I bought these speakers to take on an overseas tour, I am in the National Guard. These speakers stayed in my vehicle for the 12 months while overseas with NO problems! Even with all the dust storms, bouncing over rough roads, and use of 12-24 hours at a time, I NEVER had a problem! They produce a loud, clear sound and always worked. After my tour was through, I brought them home and still use them today, 3 years later!! I will purchase these speakers again when they time comes to retire my current ones!"
3,Decent speakers if you don't want a bulky subwoofer,"They're more than loud enough for my usage (listening to music or watching movies on my computer). I've never had to put them above 50% of the maximum volume. I especially like that they do not require a bulky subwoofer.They play sound from about 100hz to 15khz, but there is a large hole at 150hz. Still, for the speaker size, can't complain too much about the midbass. The midrange doesn't sound as ""crisp"" as I would like.Overall, the sound quality isn't perfect, but these speakers are good for the size. Certainly outperform cheaper speaker systems."
2,After 8 months...the buzzing is killing me.,"While I liked these speakers at first; having had them for 8 months I wish I could return them.Maybe I'll write Bose to see what they say. The speakers have 2 big problems, that only appeared over time.1) the buzzing when they're plugged in, but with volume all the way down, is irritating and prevents silence in my room.2) the connector for the left speaker has gone bad, I only get both left and right speaker after I've fiddled with the connection.This really sucks, because I've had them long enough that I probably can't return them and not long enough to consider them a good investment. Bose, this is a strike against you."
2,Disappointing,"Too much bass, weak mid-range. Music sounds muddled and lacks clarity. Imaging is OK. Maybe good for hard rock and heavy metal, but not suitable for classical music, country, jazz etc. Bose MediaMate is better."
5,Bose clarity in a little package.,"Great speakers, use to use them on a laptop, now they are perfect for streaming iTunes via an Airport Express. Powerful sound, with surprising fullness."
1,noise upon turn on,Notable noise from 5 feet away when power is on without musics imput probably due to cheap built-in amplifier. Though the sound is okay and the customer service of Bose is good.
2,NO ADJUSTMENT FOR THE DEEP BASE SOUND INHERIT WITH THESE SPEAKERS,MY CHEAP 25 DOLLAR SPEAKERS THAT I THREW OUT WERE BETTER - SORRY I THEW THEM OUT!! THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC I HEAR SOUNDS THICK AND WITH NO CLARITY. WILL BE LOOKING FOR BETTER ONES. BOSE - YOU HAVE SOME WORK TO DO WITH THESE SPEAKERS.
5,GREAT speakers for the price. Highly recommended :),"I had to return my first set of Bose Champion 2 speakers because they had a booming resonance when the volume was turned up above 50% in addition to the hissing background radio noise. I returned them and requested Amazon for a replacement. The second set of speakers arrived in just 5 days after I ordered replacement! They work GREAT! I am very satisfied with the quality of the sound delivered by the speakers. Playing a track with many layers of music and sounds is particularly rewarding with Bose Champion 2 speakers. Bose sound does stand up to its reputation. Having said all this, I do wish they had a power button on one of the speakers. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wishes to have compact and easily portable speakers with high quality sound for their laptop or desktop.Cheers!"
4,"Very nice, not perfect",With 300+ reviews pretty much everything has been said about these PC desktop speakers. There seems to be a sweet spot in the volume settings between 9 and 2. Below or above that and they aren't in their optimum range and they don't sound like it either.Now here is the surprise; they have a decent amp built into them. I have no problem driving my 300 ohm Sennheiser HD650 headphones with these at the same volume settings as the speakers by themselves. For example I cannot plug the HD650 directly into an iPod because the iPod doesn't have enough power to drive these. Of course a standalone desktop headphone amp would be even better but hey for $90 I'd say it's definitely a good value.
3,Unimpressed for the price - buy the next one up,"Sure these sound decent, but not $90 decent. If you can float it, I highly recommend going for the Bose Companion 20 speakers instead. They're over twice the price, but they do sound fantastic. But if you can't, then look elsewhere for something cheaper - it will sound just as good. But if you love bass-heavy pop, rap, or electronic, take a look at Klipsch. Regardless, these are probably not the speakers you're looking for unless they're magically on sale for under $50."
2,Overpriced,"I bought these because I have always wanted a Bose product. When they arrived, they were packaged carefully, and I liked the form factor. The primary letdown was the sound was tinny and the lows (base) were very poor. For $100, I expected more. I ended up buying a $35 2.1 setup that sounded much better."
5,Great Sound,"I use this for my phone and my MacBook air. I've been looking for something good, yet small and simple. These are perfect. Easy to use and produce great sound!! I just wish the cable cord to plug into computer/phone was a bit longer. Otherwise, great great buy."
3,Good one,"Its a good speaker for desktop or laptop, never tried it in big hall ... but its good enough for everyday use."
2,Bose let me down.,"The bass is boomy, loose, and overpowering with no way to adjust it. These speakers are NOT worth the money IMO. If you listen to anything with a decent bassline the song will be ruined by the speakers trying to overcompensate for their lack of size. Usually a Bose fan, but I'm pretty disappointed with these."
2,I expected more from Bose,I bought the Bose speaker set for my husband for Christmas. I figured the sound would be excellent considering that they were such a known brand. After hooking the computer speakers up and turning on some music we though the computer volume was turned down. We checked the sound on the computer itself. The sound was turned up. Needless to say...not what I exspected from Bose at all.
3,Speakers are nice but I hear constant feedback and crackling - maybe a Mac issue?,"Speakers are nice but I hear constant feedback and crackling - maybe a Mac issue? The only way I can get rid of it is to turn them off, but I like to have them on all the time. So, not sure what the issue might be, perhaps it's not quite compatible with my Mac? They're also a bit big and the sound quality is fine but not as good as I would expect from Bose."
5,nice speakers for the money,"I have been using the Bose Companion 2 Series II speaker system for about six months. I have attached them to my Imac and the sound was significantly improved. They were easy to install and use. Sound was crisp, sharp and full remembering that these are small speakers and not a $1000+ stereo system. I am somewhat eclectic in my choice of music. As I am writing this note, I am listening to E Powers Biggs playing Bach Four Great Toccatas & Fugues. The sound is good.I am sitting in somewhat of a sweet spot, directly in front of the computer and the speakers which have about 4 foot separation.I have used these with my ipod and the sound was also very good.One of the earlier reviews stated there was no off-on switch. I believe there is one on the volume knob (right speaker)If you want accessory speakers for a computer, TV or iPod these are great for the money and have been trouble free. I would recommend them."
2,Over rated product,"Bought these speakers thinking they would be as good as the Bose Around Ear Headphones. Very disappointed with the sound quality. Hard to believe that Bose labs created such a crappy product for a whopping $99.00. Competitors like Creative and Altec Lansing make better speakers for half the price. Terribly over priced. Build quality is solid but the sound quality which is what makes the speakers sell, is lacking...... mid range is good, treble is okay but bass is poor. I've heard better speakers that cost half as much. Do not buy Bose Companion 2 Series 2 speakers unless they are selling for $40. Sound cracks at high volume on my computer (75%).I don't think the founder Amar Gopal Bose needed a MIT degree to create such a sub standard product. Bose should learn to keep the quality consistent along their line of products. Or dont over price an average product such as this one. Would definitely not recommend to a friend or family."
2,Junk Bose,"I'm on my third pair, after the left speaker from the first two pair quit working. All three sets have a noisy, static-filled volume knob too. These speakers are junk. The first pair was purchased at an in-store retailer, then replaced by Bose directly via mail about four months later due to the left speaker no-longer working. The replacement pair did the same thing about six months later. These are just junk. They have the Bose label, but obviously lack the quality demanded by Bose-loving consumers such as myself.Don't buy these pieces of garbage!"
4,"Little Overpriced, but they sound great.","I purchased these for my office at work, I wanted something small but yet had some kick to the sound. These sound great at low and mid volume levels. A little overpriced, but they do sound great. Perfect as office desk speakers. They have more bass than you would think for their size."
2,"Good sound, LOW power, not for tv audio","Bought these to connect to my Sony TV since the TV's built in speakers sound crappy. Note: i have a full on 7.1 home theatre system for it, but have chosen to simply the set up (less wires, less remotes, less power, etc..). Figured a good pair of self powered PC speakers would compensate for the tv's speakers. I tried an old pair of Altecs as a test to make sure and it sounded good, though the Altecs sound tinny - thought going to a Bose model would give me good sound quality.What I found was that the Bose amplifier is really weak. I had to turn the volume up more than half way to even hear them. Yes, then they sounded good, with that Bose like room sound. I figured my TV's pre amp out was probably just really weak, so I tried them on my PC and got basically the same weak result. Im betting there is only a 15 amp in the speakers.For $90 I guess I dont want to worry about the low power issue. Sound quality maybe, but not power.Returning them."
5,Great,"Great sound, easy to hook up and contrary to another review you can turn them off. Works perfectly in my office."
1,I really wanted these to work!,"We have a Bose car stereo system and it is amazing, so I purchased these Bose speakers for my iMac. The sound was just average compared to other speakers... but the speaker loudness was very disappointing. So... they weren't great out of the box, but they were tolerable for the price, so we kept them. Big mistake... they ended up not working two months later. I wouldn't purchase these again. We have gone back to using the Altec speakers and they have been great."
2,Waste of Money,"Wow, I had heard Bose speakers were supposed to be cutting edge, and absolutely incredible. Maybe their other speakers are, but these computer speakers are shockingly bad.It's not that they are THAT bad, but the fact that they are soooo expensive and not worth even half of the price, is the part that amazes me.The first ten seconds I plugged them in and turned them on, I knew I was in trouble: The most immediate thing you'll notice is the shockingly poor balance between the treble/bass frequencies. Any voices you are listening to (song lyrics, video game dialogue, etc) sound muffled and muddy. If you are listening to music, the bass completely overpowers the higher frequencies and destroys the balance. And to top it ALL off, there is no treble or bass knob so you can adjust them. REALLY poor design choice, if you ask me.I'm taking these back tomorrow and getting a pair of $30 speakers. I'm sure they'll work just as well."
5,Bose on a Budget,"You may think spending this much on PC speakers with no subwoofer is a bit steep, but when you hear these you will be glad you spent the extra money. Personally, I am a professional and listen to music at work as much as possible and I wanted to upgrade to attain the best sound possible without a mess of speakers everywhere. Initially I put these on top of the desk, but the sound was so good that I found it too distracting to concentrate on my work. So I put them under the desk where my old set had been. The sound is still great. The best thing about Bose is the clarity and bass response. I don't know how they packed it into this small set, but they did. Literally I can shake the desk if I want to. But the clarity and enjoyment at low volume is what I am most happy about."
4,Missing my low-end,"I just purchased these and installed them on my PC. I was running a 2.1 logitec system before and we not satisfied with the volume control. After installing these I immediately noticed an improvement in sound quality (+).When I went to play my online game of coice I found that I was missing all of my low-end for explosions and other such audio feedback. I messed with my on-board sound but could not get the low puch I wanted.I ended up having to ""patch"" in my Logitec sub with it's own volume control...not ideal but it works. If I hadn't figured out how to make that happen I would have returned the product as the crisp mids and highgs just weren't enough for me to lose my lows."
2,audio cords will be it's death,Great sound after adjusted inside of computer. The extremely short audio cables will knock one or the other in the floor no matter careful. No excuse to made a guaranteed problem!
2,Over priced for value received,The sound coming from the speakers is muffled. I replaced a Boston speaker system that had a subwoofer with the Companion 2 series. It was a total waste of money and installation time.
3,"Meh, sounds like an $40 pair.","Now that I got them, I realize that the Logitech 7 year old speakers I had, sound the same. I don't know why they have a CD in the picture. Does not comes with one. Anyway, why would they?"
4,Please read below,"This is worth the audio experience; you can use this for your TV, computer, and any other audio/video device. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I have bought the same product 5 years ago and it sounds better than the version I bought here. For the record, Bose sold the exact same product 5 years ago with a bigger AC adapter, which means you are getting some bass boost. This version has a smaller AC adapter which still delivers, just that it has a lower volume pitch and some loss of bass quality. It's a great product either way, just saying, the old-school version is better!"
4,Great sounD,"So i recently got these speakers from a friend he sold them to me for 60 dollars, and i have to say they sound nicee the treble is nice and crisp i love it and ill admit it doesnt have that much bass but it has just the perfect amount of bass."
5,Excellent set of computer speakers,"I sampled these at work where I tried both sony computer speakers as well as polk audio R15 powered by a Realistic amp. With an iPod being the source, the bose stood out by miles. The speakers produce a wide sound stage and the sound is nicely balanced. The best part is Bose includes cables, though not by any means high quality, but they serve the purpose especially if your source is compressed music in the first place. I recommend buying these."
4,Great value,"I'm replacing a terrible set of $20 Logitech speakers for my laptop with these. I was blown away by the quality, and my only complaints are that the bass is a tad too dominant, and that my test track, Autechre's The Trees still doesn't quite reveal the shadowing digital scramble audible when wearing headphones.I'm seriously considering another pair for my TV and calling my home theater setup done."
3,Disappointed,"I have to admit I know close to nothing about speakers, but music is very important to me, and I bought these speakers and am pretty disappointed in them. Unless I'm missing something there is no way to control the bass/treble output and there is WAY too much bass. I don't think they sound that good sitting at the computer or across the room. I didn't want to spend that much money on computer speakers, but I do play most of my music off my computer now and thought this would be a good compromise. I have the Bose small in ear headphones and think they're amazing, and figured these would be along the same lines. We often now unplug the speakers from the computer and just use the computer speakers because the sound just does not sound right, no matter how we try to control it in iTunes. The other thing I really don't like about them is that there is no way to turn them on or off so they stay on all the time and there is always a constant buzz. Very disappointed."
2,Just not good,I bought the Companion 2 Series 2 to use as speakers for my Sony TV. I picked them over Logitech and some other brands because they had stereo jacks that made them easy to connect to the TV and their size fit my space. They did not improve the sound at all. There is such a heavy bass bias to these speakers that it made listening to speech very difficult for both my wife and I. They would probably be OK if you are playing war games that featured a lot of explosions and crashes. They did nothing to dissuade me from my opinion that Bose products are overpriced.
2,So muddy it's silly (for music),"I am not a distinguished listener, but I do own some quality gear. These are total mud. The mids and lows are completely washed out; they seem that they are trying to be ""boomy"". As another reviewer mentioned, there's nothing regarding the frequency response in the documentation, a small warning flag. I wanted some cheap speakers for my desk without taking up a lot of room, and from a physical perspective, these are great. But the sound they produce is just garbage, unfortunately. My 1998 Yamaha MST-15 computer speakers sound better.Note that I bought these for casual music listening. They are probably fine for games, where the music is secondary to the sound effects."
5,Could not ask for anything better,"AWESOME computer speakers. Clean, crystal & vibrate sound. Easy instructions and setup is a brease. Not so stylish as others, but still looks great. The picture shows a CD with the speakers, but did not have one! So, I'm not sure what's that about... however, just follwed the inclosed instruction and presto.. great BOSE sound."
4,Speaker review,"Works well, easy to install. I was hoping for a little more volume to the speakers but overall very pleased!"
2,Not what i expected from Bose,I love the companion 5 speakers after hearing those speakers the companion 2 will sound like a total disappointment. on the other had these speakers are perfect for those who love extra bass. I think for such small speakers they produce way too much bass.
2,Poor Quality-,"The sound quality on these speakers is great....However the construction quality is terrible!About a year after buying these speakers, the left speaker just stopped working. I was disappointed and thought maybe I was just unlucky and the thing broke. I really liked the sound quality so I went out and bought another pair of the exact same speakers. Today, about 6 months after purchasing my second pair of speakers, THE LEFT SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING....AGAIN!I don't usually write any reviews for products I buy but this really got me angry and I felt like I could at least write a bad review and share my unfortunate experience with the Bose Companion 2 speakers."
1,Piece of crap - Left speaker does not work!!,"I cannot believe I would be writing this kind of review, my very first in Amazon after being customer for ca. 10yrs. I decided to get this models, since, hey, they are Bose, so quality should not be a problem, right? Wrong!! I took them out of the box, and after connecting them, the left speaker would practically not work, very dim and low sound. I did all the standard trouble shooting (way beyond the skinny guide in the manual) and nothing. For reference,I am an engineer specialized in troubleshooting, so I am sure they are defective. To make things worst, I bought them in US but do not live there so I am doubting I will get them repaired in the local representative. Thank you Bose, will never buy again."
2,Not Worth The Price! Do not buy.,"I expected more from Bose, for $100.00 dollars I could have purchased speakers with a subwoofer with better sound."
1,"Horrible muddy bass, treble not clear","Who are these people who rate these speakers highly? They sound terrible, and for the price you can find much better for about half the price. Try Logitech with a separate bass. These sound muddy and kinda flat. I bought them for a friend where these are his only speakers and I am filled with regret for my choice. Bose can be great, but some of their products are pure ripoffs. This is the later."
1,too expensive for quality,"Any good 30$ 2.1 speakers will give a better performace than Bose speakers. I had HP 2.1 multimedia speakers and bought these to have better experience. The sound quality is too flat compared to HP speakers. They sounded almost like passive speakers, only very loud."
1,Bose is selling carpets and not speakers,"I called Bose to find out what the output of their Companion 2 series II multimedia speakers is and she tells me they don't have such information, that they go by the square foot area. This is really funny because I thought I was asking about a carpet and not speakers.I have never heard of speakers that don't have PMPO or RMS output!!!"
3,Muddy middle frequencies but okay for the price,"These speakers are compact and easy to use with a computer. Dual inputs allow use of computer and other (DVD player, etc.) equipment. Pretty good sound for the money but a little muddy in the mid range and upper bass range. There are other speakers for about the same money which have better sounding response. Not unhappy but wish the muddiness could be cleared up."
4,Minus 1 star for price; 4 for everything else,"OK yes you are paying for the Bose name which is not worth as much as Bose likes to think it is (kinda like Gucci purses). But spec for spec these are decent sounding speakers. I wouldn't use for them anything but a desktop computer and like any other speaker, you don't need alot for the office or desktop environment. Sadly I guess what I like most is the cosmetics, these just look prettier sitting out in the open versus speaker that had more muscle. A good analogy is these are the Bruce Lee of speakers (small and high performing) versus something like M-Audios or Audioengines which are more Lou Ferrigno(big and powerful)."
4,"Great sounding small speaker, perfect present","I'm been a Bose owner for the past 15 years. I started with the Bose System 3. That's all it took to hook me on their commercials and boasts. These Bose Companion 2 speakers are a great addition to my iMac 24"". Nice crisp highs with the solid base Bose is known for. Compared to any speaker set in this price range, the Bose is a no question winner. Set up took a good 2 minutes and I ran it through the paces from AC/DC Bonfire, The Beatle, Love, Rush, Moving Pictures, Tony Bennett, Stepping Out and The Who, Quadrophenia - these speakers passed the test. This is a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for - or your kid going to college. I'm going to buy a couple of more pairs for my LCD tv's and my computer at work. For under 100 bucks, this is a worthwhile purchase."
4,Wonderful speakers,I love my Bose Companion 2 speakers! I've had them for years and they are still just as wonderful as when I first purchased them. I listen to music almost every single day on my computer and for hours on end. I've even blared the music while cleaning the house and could still hear my music clearly (my computer is downstairs)upstairs!The downside?I wasn't too thrilled with the fact that there isn't an on/off button on these things. Just volume up and volume down.
4,"They sound great but,",The speakers sound amazing and were the perfect choice for me there rather loud and perfect for listening to music and watching videogames. The only problem which could be a defect is that when close to not in use and close to my computer there is a crackling and buzzing emitted not a big deal but thats why i give it 4/5 stars
4,Lacking in features but great sound quality,"I bought these to use at my office and didnt want a sub system so that it doesnt bother others. There are a few features it is missing so first for the negatives:- For example it has 2 inputs but there is no way to switch between inputs, both are mixed and on.- There is also no power switch, the speakers are always on when plugged in.- There are also no bass and treble controls.- Sometimes it can sound a little boomey depending on the source material.However for the postives:- Cleanly recorded material sounds wonderful.- I'd say this is close to the $300 sounddock for a third of the price.- Even at low volumes, the sound is well balanced and evenIf you want some of that great bose sound this is a great entry."
5,great sound,everything we wanted and more! very nice sound easy set up. shipped and arrived on time. very very very nice
5,Great Bose Speakers,The Speakers are relatively small yet deliver that great Bose sound. I'm very happy with them and would recommend them.
1,these speakers are awful,"the things came, pluged them in the sounded pretty crumy but tolerabe but as i listened to the over the next few weeks the channel started to flick off and on... the jacks and plugs suck, the sound terrible"
5,Great Speakers for a little bit of everything,"I've used these speakers now for about 3 years now. Originally I had bought them for my MacBook Pro, but soon grew out of them with some nicer studio monitors, so they sat in my closet for a while until I bought a new TV and they became permanent. For the price, you can't beat the sound improvement from your stock TV speakers to this -it's unbeatable. They aren't a home theatre system, but they also only cost $99. So if you're looking on upgrading the sound to your TV or computer, these are a great option."
2,Not the usual full Bose sound,Disappointed but perhaps it's because of my 5 year old computer's audio. The sound is acceptable but not very impressive.
4,Highly satisfactory for the purpose,"My computer isn't my principal listening station, so I didn't buy these speakers to replace my main system--which is also Bose. That said, these are excellent speakers, and I have spent hours listening to different kinds of music, my preferences being classical, jazz and world music. If you like super bass or super volume, these won't satisfy you, but if you like a balanced sound with articulate bass and decent highs with crisp definition and don't want to spend a fortune, these are great little speakers. I've read the negative reviews, which indicate that some people have had problems with them. If you do, exchange them and get a set that works properly. I would give them 5 stars for performing as expected. I only gave them 4 because they aren't equivalent to the bigger Bose systems."
2,Jacks never fit right,"I have the older version of these speakers, and they have been great for years. But I bought this model for my son last year, and right away we had sound issues related to poorly fitting jacks and plugs. I taped all the wires to the speakers so they won't come loose, but we still get sound fluctuations. Its frustrating to own a decent speaker but have it fail due to something like wiring."
3,bose companion 2,not so good...the speaker is vibrating on little high volumes.....and the volume itself is not so very high....Please return my money back
3,Nice $50 Speakers...,Good $50 speakers - too bad they cost $100. Typical of Base - a quality product but overpriced.They sound good but not a lot of power or anything amazing.No complaints other than the cable to connect the speakers to your PC is rather short.
4,very good but needs alittle more work.,i bought these to replace some cheap logitech i have been using for over a year. i already had some BOSE headphones so i kinda knew what to hope for. they didnt let me down.the sound quailty is great but right of the bat i noticed that these almost kill the bass for most music that is bass heavy. not so bad cuz i listen to more classical and acostic music. and lots of other music. so not such a horrable things. The Highs Mids and Lows are very sharp and crisp. the only bad note on my part is that i wish the volume went higher. these are by no means the loudsest speakers but they are farly loud.and should they ever break or die i would buy another pair a.s.a.p.
5,Can't go wrong with Bose,"I got this set just over a week ago and I'm simply amazed at the high quality sound. Sub-woofer? ""I don' need no sub-woofer!"" Not even necessary as these sound that good and have plenty of bass, so if you're crammed for room, this is the way to go. Clear, crisp music reproduction makes the music sound very genuine like the original instruments. I realize the ""high end audiophile"" way is to not eq nor process anything, and these are great without any tone adjustments. However, for me, using my PC's on board eq as normal with these speakers make them sound simply outstanding! They are also plenty loud enough and the angled design makes proper speaker placement perfect on a desktop. Music reproduction the way it's meant to be heard. You just can't go wrong with Bose."
3,definitely name over quality,"i hate to say it, but even the untimely ""best"" bose are in the ranking for inadequacy.yes, they are the less expensive of the bunch, NOT disregarding the expense at task.it is double your limit, triple your disappointment. sure, they will last for a few short months at a low amplified level, but just know that the amp & bass only go(es) so far.i have yet to upgrade, but an elaboration is brewing within the potential continuance :)"
1,worst company ever,"its so sad that people are still raving about their sound, have any of you listened to other equipment? maybe the name bose just makes it ok to make and sell junk from the 90s and 80s, other speaker manufactures have made leaps in bounds in music and movie sound reproduction in the past 20 years, bose is the same old bose, they sell the same mediocre stuff(at least its become cheaper) but they still cant get this stuff too work all the time, what are they doing if not upgrading the sound to where every other company?people let your ears do the deciding not the name of the company."
1,not worth for 100$,"Researched so much over companion II , not worth for $ u r spending...i wud say..."
5,Sound Quality Is Great,I hear no buzzing or any of the anomalies reported by other users and the speakers are being used under triple monitors and between two laptops on docking stations. Shielding is fine. Enjoying this purchase!
4,Bose Companion 2 Series II,"These sound very good. Very full sound, but a bit hard to hear the mid range and high frequencies. The only problem I have, and maybe this is just mine, is that when I plug in headphones to its headphone jack, I can still hear the sound coming from the speakers. It's quieter but noticeable, whereas usually plugging in headphones will mute the speakers."
3,"Top Dollar, Half the performance","I purchased the Bose Companion Computer Speakers about six months ago. When I first purchased them I was very content and happy. The looked slick, clean, and fresh, though was I plugged them into my computer a different story was told. The quality from these speakers which are suppose to be ""top-of-the-line"" sound, created the worst distortion ever. If you are in the mood to listen to light piano melodies at a soft volume then these speakers are for you, though if you are having a few friends over for a get together and needs some tunes, do not expect to get too much support from these speakers. My suggestion to you as the consumer is if you are going to spend top dollar for some quality speakers, make sure you get speakers that will give you top performance rather than speakers who wuss out on you after you have the volume only half way up. I wondered why people said BOSE stood for ""Buy..Other..Speakers..Eventually"". Now I see why..."
4,Very good,"It sounds very good, especially the low part. The high part is just so so. Anyway, as a computer speaker system, it is quite strong."
5,Amazing Sound,"I received this product as a gift for my new iMac and I am very impressed with the sound quality that comes out of these speakers. I have always known Bose for amazing built quality and amazing sound and these do not dissapoint. Sounds like I have a stereo system coming from my iMac. Highly recommend them.For those that complain about the the static, I also had this coming from the left speaker and I realized that the problem was that the main speaker was to close to the monitor which was causing static, I separated the speaker a bit and the static/crackling noise ended."
5,"At the end, it is bose","They are not the most cheap but when you buy bose you already know that you have quality on the way.I am not an expert but for music in the kitchen or near the computer, this is it.The bass feature is very good for such a small speaker"
3,Not as what expected,"I mean for the price of the speakers i was at least expecting good quality from it. These speakers dont that loud, my really old computer speakers could go louder than these which i was disappointed in. I guess these speakers would be a good size for a really small room, i have a decent size small room and it's still not that loud. The quality from these speakers are okay, i was expecting crisp quality but can't see that much of a difference. The base is barely noticeable even on full volume. I rate this product a 3 stars for not being bad, but for not being what i expected for the price. I think you can find a much better speaker for the price."
2,Does not live up to Bose name,"We have a Bose sound dock for my iPod which has amazing sound. I love this product, so I chose the Bose Companion 2 speakers for my new laptop, assuming they would have the same quality of sound. They DO sound good at a very low level. The bass is nice, and the sound clear. But if you turn the volume up to anything beyond a low level, the sound gets muddy and tends to fade in and out. Wondering if perhaps it was my laptop and not the speakers, I plugged them in to my husband's desktop with the same results.For what it's worth, the speakers are attractive, nicely sized, and came well packaged. But for $100, I know I can do better so I am returning them. They definitely do not live up to the Bose name."
3,Bose only an expensive name,"I bought these based on the Bose name. Bose is Bass. Anything Bose that I ever bought had always to much bass. I used my Eq on my media player to bring out the high end on my computer and these speakers sounded tinty and were sputtering. The Creative Labs Gigaworks t20 series, and t40 series will get you excited about your speakers again. Awesome for about the same price. Bose Blows."
2,Not so good,"Unpacking these, I was impressed by how solid and heavy they were and how well they were crafted. They should deliver pretty good sound for my small home office, right? No. After of couple of hours of listening, I gave up. The base was overwhelming, and not in a good way. Vocals were muffled in the mix and sounded distant. Sometimes iTunes' equalizer can be tweaked to help somewhat, but not to any significant degree with these.... the heavy-handed base smothers everything. I packed them up to be returned."
2,Looks good and sounds canned...,"I bought this one because of the good reviews here and I was very...very disaponted. It has more bass compared with most of the other speakers of the similiar size but the problem is that the music is twisted (in order to empasize bass) sounding like from a can. I returned it and bought a Klipsch Promedia 2.0 and there is simly no comparison!It's not fair to reqire this kind of tiny speakers to perform, but the Bose's problem is to use a price tag to impress the buyers in stead of focusing on quality.I believe some of the reviewers here are just new to home audio. I still remember how I was excited when upgrading my OEM dell speakers to a entry-level 3.1 system for the first time.Well, if you do not believe me, just buy a pair of Klipsch ProMedio 2.0 and see for yourself if Bose worths even $50."
4,Good Speakers in its category!,"These speakers are the best I had ear in its category, no surround, no subwoofer, but great and clear sounds for your mp3, home video, short clips, games and other things you play in your computer.You can also adjust the settings of your audio card to improve the sound.Hope this could be helpfull, :)"
4,Love it!,I live in a 2 bedroom matchbox...with a desktop in the living room serving as the study/ work space. The Bose speakers more than suffice as a tiny little entertainment Center with primary source of variety enetrtainment being..youtube! My personal collection of CDs- including ethereal Hindustani classical music to cathedral Pink Floyds- all come alive in this little setup..I love it!
2,Really disappointed,"These speakers are fine for routine (ie: non-music-listening) tasks and when the volume is low - crank it up to listen to music and they are AWFUL. Distorted and ""crackly"", I thought it must be the cables or even my sound card. Connected a set of M-Audio Studiophile AV 40s (using the same cables) and realized: it's these speakers. Ordered another set of the M-Audios and tossing these."
2,Compression Circuitry? Why???,"I just think it's so obnoxious to have any sort of compression circuitry in a speaker. Songs were not meant to sound like this! If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's basically what makes the speakers sound like someone is messing with the levels while you listen to a song, turning them up and down. When it gets too loud, Bose has implemented a circuitry to smash the volume down to the appropriate level that they deem. This makes for a very awkward listening experience. Thank goodness I didn't pay for these (Dad's old speakers).Besides that, they're Bose, and Bose always has dark sounding speakers. Screw their brand recognition...they're crap."
4,Sound Great Once You Setup Your Computer,"After shopping around for a few months I bought these speakers at Best Buy, for $99 +tax, to use with Adobe Premiere. At first I was unimpressed, then I went into my computer settings and adjusted the EQ, now they sound great! I am very happy with these speakers but if I had one complaint it would be the lack of shielding on the RCA to 1/8"" cable, that goes from the right speaker to the computer. If you don't keep it away from other cables you may get some interference hum, however I'm not sure any other system would have anything better. My wife and I love the sound of these speakers so much we are going to buy another pair to use with our family room tv. FYI - These are not a flat sounding speaker, would not recommend for editing/recording music, yet great for listening to already mastered music."
4,Great value. Great sound.,"I was a little concerned with a few reviews that I read here and by the low price of this 2.0 speaker system, but I went for it. I needed a new compact speaker system for my laptop, didn't want a subwoofer and couldn't stand my USB powered speakers anymore. I'm a bit of a audio snob and constantly complained about the tinny sound that my old speakers pushed out.The Bose Companion 2 Series II multimedia speaker system is a great value - well under $100 and I could honestly say that it sounds like a 2.1 system (with subwoofer). The sound is full and bright, like one would expect from Bose speakers. The speakers aren't something you would put in your laptop case, but they are nice looking and built solid. I couldn't ask for anything more. Very satisfied with the Bose Companion 2 Series II multimedia speaker system."
3,Short lived for the price,"These worked great for a little over a year, then they blew out. If you are going to play music that's heavy on base, I suggest you use a very low volume. My husband is fond of cranking up the rock, which, I'm sure hastened their demise. Still, for what I paid for them, I would have expected a much longer life."
5,Bose for my computer,The Bose Companion 2 Series II Multimedia Speaker System is perfect for my desktop computer. The frequency response is all I need to enjoy my large library of audio.
5,Every song a winner on this album!,"Most every album I buy has a few songs I love, a couple I like and some I'd rather skip past. ""God is Working"" has one great song after another. ""More than Enough"" has brought me to tears more than once. ""Church Medley"" includes ""Glory Hallelujah to the Risen King"" and ""Send it Down"" - and yes, it does bring the house down!The soloists have outstanding voices and the songs carry you from soul-thumping rhythms to tender ballads. This one is a must-have!"
5,Love this music!,"Had a cassette of this and lost it during moving. Am so happy to have it again and be able to listen any time I like, again. :)"
4,"cd purchase ""God is Working""","I really enjoy the music on this Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir cd, except the cd itself must have scratches or some defect because from the 1st time I listened to it there are skips in several places.""God is Working"" is full of praise for the Lord in a variety of tempos. I like variety!"
5,Unexpected plot with lots of twists,"This was an excellent book that snatched my attention and wouldn't let go until the end. I'm usually pretty good at predicting plots (books with predictable plots are usually rather lame), but Holjag kept me guessing. The vivid details really help you get into the story."
5,Great story line,"I just finished reading this book, and was pleasantly surprised. Normally I am not a sci-fi reader, but this book was recommended to me and I am glad I read it. I found it easy to identify to the characters and moved by their emotions. The imagination and thought that went into this book amazes me. There were a few different scenarios going throughout the book and I was impressed at how well they all wound in together at the climax of the book. Can't wait for the author to publish something else!"
3,O.K. for the price,"This mirror is nice for the price, if you can loosen the adjustment screw. It was in there so tight it broke when we tried to loosen it. Needless to say, we were able to fix it and still use it. Our's just might have been faulty. Otherwise, nice mirror."
1,i was under the impression i was buying 2 gettin 1 for 2 price,i was very unsatisfied with one of something that is supposed to be sold in a pair
3,Broke after 6 months!,"When it works, it works quite well and does a great job of picking up pet hair. However, as others have stated it is quite heavy. I am very annoyed to report, however, that I have only had my vacuum for six months and the small motor has given out and I've had to take it in for repair (under warranty) and am without a vacuum for two weeks. I have a 1000 ft. condo so it is not like I am vacumming large amounts of space every single day. The repair shop had loads and loads of bagless cleaners and warned me not to get another one so I would think twice before purchasing another bagless."
2,Not as promised.,"We were really disappointed in this Vacuum. We did quite a bit of research before we purchase and after we found out Good Housekeeping recommended it as their top medium priced upright, we picked it.It works great on the floor setting when used on rugs and picked up dog hair. However, it was so heavy it was difficult to maneuver. If you went from floor to rug and had to lift it slightly, it was near impossible.Now, if you're a strong, agile young person, perhaps you would have no problem, but I'm not and I found the vacuum to be extremely heavy and hard to push and pull. If I used this vacuum, house-cleaning would be a real chore."
5,Easy to Buy Service Plan,We purchased this service plan to go with our new camera and received the paperwork within 10 days--very quick! Would definitely recommend!
3,false advertising,"I ordered this gown specifically because it was batiste, a soft, 100% finely woven cotton. Nothing in the description of the item indicated the fabric content as other than batiste. It turns out to be 65% polyester. I was very disappointed, but have washed it about 15 times and it's getting a little softer. The company expressed their sorrow at my disappointment and sent me postage to return it, but, as I told them, the gown is not unwearable, it just isn't as presented on the website. By the way, I looked at every online dictionary I could find and every one defined batiste as finely woven cotton/linen--not a single one said ""may contain polyester""."
3,Values.........with Ike and Mamie then [and Now?],"A period of great innocence, beautifully reflected in this really sweet little tale about a Country Girl [Debbie at her most charming] mixing with those City Folk and finding true love [bit of a journey, but she gets there]. AND it somewhat all plays for real and pulls you in! THERE IS ALSO Debbie's hit song. Leslie Nielsen is perfect as the love interest, great casting.NOW, if only Miss Carrie Fisher could pen a sequel ... I'm sure that Debbie and Leslie would instantly accept. Along the lines of ""Tammy, was it True?""; ""Tammy 2002?"", you get my drift......"
5,Delicate and Delightful,"This movie is just as the character Tammy herself, charming, kind, and good natured. It isn't driven by heavy, complicated themes, but does everything have to be? There is something of great value in simplicity and honesty. I much prefer them to arrogance and cruelty. When I think of a young girl in love, I will always see Debbie Reynolds at her windowsill, bathed in moonlight, singing Tammy. Tammy and Bachelor is a delightful, delicate movie, well worth watching."
5,This Movie Should Be On DVD.,I first saw the movie Tammy And The Bachelor on the classic movie channel AMC and I loved it! It is a delightful movie about a backwoods country girl named Tammy played by Debbie Reynolds who goes to stay with a wealthy family after her grandpa who is her legal guardian gets in trouble when he is caught making moonshine and she falls in love with the son of the family who is named Pete and played by Leslie Nielsen. Yes this is the same Leslie Nlelsen from The Airplane and Naked Gun comedy movies and he was very good in this movie and so is Debbie Reynolds as Tammy. I wish they would put this delightful movie on DVD!
5,A very sweet movie,The music and the story were both quite memorable. What a sweet theme and setting. Certainly a family-friendly movie although it is a romance so more of a girl-friendly show. I LOVED it!!!
3,Nice case but no clip,"This is a nice leather case for the Zune HD. It is well crafted and I like it, but it doesn't have a belt clip or anything, so if you need that don't buy this one."
4,different book,"Actually, the book pictured here is Leinster's 1967 ""The Time Tunnel,"" a novelization of the Irwin Allen television series which ran on ABC from 1966-67. Mr. Weiss' review is of Leinster's 1964 ""Time Tunnel,"" which may have served as the inspiration for the series but had a different plot and characters.I read this book as a child, and although I don't recall enough of the details to give an accurate summation of the story line, I do recall it being an enjoyable read."
5,Excellent and reliable,"I've used Lacie drives since the mid-90s, and they have been consistently reliable-completely plug and play.I highly recommend them to professionals for backup they can count on."
5,THE definitive book on carousel animals by a master carver,"Sherrell Anderson, a true master carver in the style of the master carousel creators of the 19th century, has written the one book that can tell you about carousel animals from inside the business. Not a collector or dilettante, he is one of the foremost creators, restorers and overall authorities in the world of carousels. This authoritative book covers carousel history, carving techniques and offers a real inside look at the beauty and wonder of carousel animals. The pictures are incredible, including shots of unique custom-made animals that have never been seen elsewhere. This book is a must for collectors or anyone who loves carousels."
2,Very strong smell to me,"These wipes come in containers that are individually sealed in plastic overwrap. Even through this sealed plastic I could smell the perfume. I opened one up, opened the lid and took a sniff and immediately sneezed. Granted the sneeze could of been a coincidence. It's not an unpleasant smell, but it is, to me, a very strong smell. It reminds me a bit like the smell of Soft Soap. I tend to buy things unscented, so if you're used to scented products this may be fine for you. We won't be using them."
2,Don't buy this book,"Don't bother with this book. I'm a student taking a class in assembly language, and it's almost hard to believe an author would gloss over so many things and give problems at the end of chapters and chapter segments which he gives no clue whatsoever in the text as to how to solve them. If I were the author, I'd be almost embarassed at some of the laxity in this book's organization. I suppose it might have a few good points, but you'd be better off looking elsewhere."
1,Good for something,"About the only use I've found for this book is for kindling on those chilly winter nights. Even my assembly professor agrees that you should not waste your money with this one. The exercises are a joke, it's information on flag changes is completely wrong, and there isn't even a decent reference for the most basic of instructions. Go with Irvine, a much better investment."
4,ear to the ground,"Usually, jazz critics can provide a very concise, historical and literary review of an album. I can promise that mine won't, as I have not cultivated the sophistication that predominates among jazz listeners. I do know what I like though, and have always made an attempt to select music that is good, whatever the genre. 'There are only two types of music' according to Mozart, 'good music, and bad'.What you have on this CD is good music. So modern that it is difficult to recognise the concepts, (when compared to styles such as bebop or even M-Base). But you can hear the authenticity of the players, who have favoured a very free style. O'Leary, the Irish guitarist, teams up with Polish trumpeter Stanko and American drummer Hart to provide music of a very high level. Which is to be expected when world reknowned band leaders team up. The title track is a serious piece of music. Enjoy."
4,Consistent quality,"I have used Hemke reeds for the last 20 years. I discarded one the other day after only beginning to play with it, but I do not remember the last time I had to to that. The reeds do not typically warp. They are cut to center every time. The strength is consistent among boxes, and the tone is always great. They are my reed of choice for my C*(s), yanganasawa jazz, vandoren jazz, and otto link mouthpieces. I use them on alto, soprano, and tenor. I would love it if they could maintain strength longer, and I usually have to dispose of them within a few weeks after I begin playing on them, but non-synthetic reeds can't last forever."
4,a useful devotional commentary,"Bible study leaders and lay Christians looking for a devotional rather than technical commentary should find this series useful. Easley is a conservative protestant (prof. of New Testament at Mid-America Baptist Seminary, Memphis) but shows tolerance for differing interpretations of this difficult book of the Bible. The commentary is thoroughly organized and very easy to read. Every chapter follows the same outline: introductory story, verse-by-verse commentary on the text, conclusions and principles for the Christian life, practical application, a fitting prayer, an ""in depth"" section giving more historical detail, an outline for Bible study teachers, and a list of issues for discussion. Unfortunately there are no maps or illustrations. Recommendable for its intended goal (growing in Christ) and audience (layperson, Bible study leader). If you are searching for a heavier, technical commentary, then Aune and Beale are preferable."
2,A collection of studies,"This book appears to be a collection of studies related to women, stress and heart disease. It does not have a beginning, middle or conclusion. I guess I was expecting something else."
5,Who knew Hugh Laurie was such a GREAT author too!!!,"This book mixes humor with a suspenseful story line. He's able to tell an exciting adventure with little violence and sexual overtones. In other words he uses his talent for writting to capture the reader and hook you into the story. Not to reveal the ending but it does take a few twists. Hopefully, he writes another!!!!"
3,Good for a First,"A good read. Has all the tangibles of a good spy tale. British agents, U.S. agents, political intrigue and corruption at a high level. The protagonist, a reluctant hero, is thrust into a plot to stage a phony crisis designed to pump billons of dollars in business to the arms industry and towards one arms dealer in paticular. The plot has lots of twists and turns and along the way our hero lays it on thick with the wit and sarcasm in a British sort of way. The story takes a while to develope and gets kind of muddled in the middle but picks itself up and comes together towards the end and finishes with a nice, but not too predictable end to it all. After all is said and done, if this Mr. Laurie's first attempt at a novel, I think he gets good marks. If he writes another I would want to read it."
3,Actor vs. author,"It was funny, entertaining and well-done but teddibly British. He is a good writer but very much a better actor."
4,Very entertaining,"Good spy novel, with flashes of dry humour that fans of Hugh Laurie's earlier, pre-House television work will definitely appreciate."
2,Average pulp fiction.,"Mildly entertaining - worth the sale price for the novelty of Hugh Laurie's first published novel. Perhaps my expectations of Laurie were too high. The plot was unbelievable and the characters were stereotypical caricatures. The ""cleverisms"" I was looking forward to were present in spades, but delivered so unnaturally in the narrative that they jarred me out of the story line; it felt like the main character was delivering snarky asides to the reader, sometimes at the expense of the other characters. ""Wink, wink, I'm not taking this life-threatening situation any more seriously than an episode of Fry & Laurie. Snicker.""That said, The Gun Seller *was* entertaining, if too fluffy for my tastes. I am curious to see how (if) Laurie's writing progresses. If his next digital novel is on sale, too, I'll probably buy it."
4,Give it a chance,"Slow to start. Agonizly slow. But, due to the amazing photo of Hugh on the flap, I kept reading, if only to sneak glances at that. Then, I started imagining our lovely Hugh WAS Thomas Lang, and the book got exponentially better. Well, I don't have much experience with spy type novels(Bourne's all I've got in that area), but I liked that I wasn't constantly confused and shaking my head. The plot is easy to follow, and of course there's helicopters, agencies, and a big conspiracy all involved.I'm amazed that Hugh can write such a good yarn, in addition to being my favorite actor. Oh, and I suppose he also sings too. What can't he do?It was exciting book once I gave the characters and situations time to devolp. Oh, and there is a certain comparison about women and cars that I shall never forget.Now, I wish he would get busy and write the talked about sequel, Paper Soldier!"
4,Humorous thriller,"This is a very enjoyable first novel by the great Hugh Laurie, of ""Blackadder"", ""Jeeves and Wooster"", and ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"" fame. (He's also doing some American TV these days...House or something.) I don't know why so many people keep calling this a spy-novel ""spoof"", like a literary ""Johnny English"". Perhaps they should look up the definition of the word ""spoof"". This is a pretty straightforward novel of international intrigue, terrorism and adventure. What sets it apart from your ordinary thriller is the wonderfully effervescent literary voice of Hugh Laurie. I only know P.G. Wodehouse's works by reputation, but his name comes to mind with this book. Laurie's writing is witty and funny, in a very British way, and the man has a knack for strikingly original turns-of-phrase. Unfortunately, the plot was a little confusing in parts, and his characterization skills need polishing, but the writing saves it."
5,Another reason to love Hugh Laurie,"If you thought Hugh Laurie was just an amazing actor, then you need to read his wonderful first (and hopefully not last) book. The Gun Seller is a suprisingly hilarious, fast-paced, page turner from beginning to end. While I am not normally one for spy novels, this book has changed my thinking on the genre. You'll immediately find yourself rooting for the main character, begging the book gods for a happy ending for this unlikely hero. Laurie's quick wit with words and insane plot twists are golden - I could not have asked for a better read."
5,Almost Perfect,"All the raves of this book are deserved. The highlight is the way dry humor is weaved into plot and character descriptions. It is really hard to put down. The narrator is like a 'Lucky Jim' for the 90's... My only negative comment concerned the ending. The last 30 pages sound contrived and predictable. The whole book to that point is unique but the conclusion was like every spy/action novel you've ever read.The good points of the book far outweigh that one minor flaw, however. This is one of the most entertaing novels I've read in some time. I would recommend it highly."
3,Good but not great,"If you're a fan of Stephen Fry's work (as I am) you'll probably enjoy The Gun Seller, but you may come away from it slightly disappointed. Hugh Laurie does a good job of crafting an engaging story, but there's too much cliche British humor that we've all seen a thousand times before. The author would have done a better job if he had respected his own voice to a greater degree and included less generic BBC humor.I was left with the feeling that Mr. Laurie will probably (hopefully) bring us many more novels and that as his experience as a novelist grows his books will develop into something more subtle and unique. All in all a diamond that's still slightly in the rough. If I had to buy it/read it again I would."
2,I'll stick with House,"Although Laurie did grab me from the beginning and take a wild ride, I soon lost interest in the book. I don't know if it was the cast of characters showing up after a 100 page hiatus or if it was just way the story was being told. Eventually, I sent down the book and never finished it."
4,"Not an easy read, but still a good story . . .","As you may know, this book was written back in the late nineties by Hugh Laurie, or Gregory House for all you House fans. I was not expecting the British short humor writing style when I first started reading this book. Once i got used to it, it turned out to be a really good story. The main character Thomas Lang is written so well that I could actually see Hugh Laurie playing the lead if a movie was ever made out of this story. The Thomas Lang character is written very closely to how Gregory House acts. Almost makes me wonder if Hugh Laurie helps write on House. Anyway, a good all around read!"
3,For this price I should get a special edition DVD,"Good read, but for the list price we should get a DVD and not a paperback book. Even the used price is high. Buy used or check it out from the library and you'll enjoy it."
2,Unmemorable,"Not really the up-to-snuff, top drawer Brit humour we expect from Hugh Laurie. I'm writing this 6 months after reading the book, and really I remember very little of the book. ""Unmemorable"" must be my final thought."
1,Too much profanity,"Having not read it first, I purchased ""The Gun Seller"" for my mother because she is not only an avid reader, but a great fan of P.G. Wodehouse and the ""Jeeves & Wooster"" TV series starring Hugh Laurie.After a couple of weeks, I checked back with her to see how she had enjoyed it. She confessed that she wanted to like it, but threw it away after reading just the first couple of chapters; the language (particularly the frequent use of the F-word and the profane use of deity) was simply too much for her.If you don't mind that kind of language, I suppose you won't even notice it in this book. But I wish I had known before purchasing it for mom."
1,Awful,"I couldn't read past the first few pages and I finally gave up. I like Hugh as an actor in his TV show ""house,"" however, I find that his surly demeanor although attractive in the show makes his writing unappealing.My suggestion to Hugh is, stay with what you do best, acting."
2,"Stick to your day job, House.","This guy couldn't write his way out of a Russian tea room, namely because he doesn't know Russian. However, as a novel, I could barely keep my eyes on the TV set. What a distraction. Please, keep your day job as a doctor. As a top diagnostician, you have touched and saved many lives. How many novelists can say that? I hope that you will continue to write as a hobby but please leave the publishing for your estate after your death ... which I hope isn't soon as I love your reality show about your medical career. PS: sorry about the leg. I worry you might be self-medicating."
1,An inaccurate look at the arms trade.,"A bizarre book. I was recommended this so called politcal text, written by a young academic (whose university is not I hasten to add stated) by a co-professor. I can only assume the author has wealth to fund his own works, as this book has no signifcance in the current or historical world of arms trade. He shows no evidence for his work and frankly I cannot show my dismay enough."
5,Amazing!,"Excellent read, fast paced, funny, serious, five stars, reminded me of Agatha Christie's work for some reason. Too bad it's his only book, I'd like to read more."
4,"not exactly ""House"" but very good","Fans of Laurie's Doctor House will not find an exact match in this novel, but they won't be disappointed either. Thomas Lang has much of the author's own sarcastic, biting wit about him, and he comes across as much more interesting than your typical spy/thriller hero because of it.Humor is a strong part of this, and the inner monologue shared with the reader is full of self-deprecating, ironic comments, and the text is rife with send ups of standard cliches. There are a few times he goes over the top with these, but it suits the style and the tone of the book perfectly so those are easily overlooked.Language is a bit strong for my personal tastes, but certainly in bounds for the setting and the genre.A strong ending, with a few unexpected twists. Overall a fine novel and I hope to see more from him."
3,Interesting,It was okay. Was interested in the book because of the author. It wasn't one of the better books I have read.
2,Not crazy about,"I LOVE Hugh Laurie - I love his acting, and he's an incredible musician. However, I just didn't care for this book. I didn't even get through the first three chapters before I gave up. Someone else might enjoy it (and others obviously have from the reviews), but I didn't. :("
2,Disappointing!,"As Dr. House, his continous cryptic dialogue is interesting. As the main character in the book, it was less than interesting. In his wtitings, he just could say ""yes"" or ""no"" without oververbalizing each thought. Got tedious afterwhile. Moreover, the plot had a lot of holes in it from my perspective and the word ""plausibility"" kept coming to my mind."
4,I liked it because it was a little different.,"It was sort of off the chain, I only gave it the 4 stars because I felt at times the flow was inconsistent."
5,Very Good!,"Recommended to me by the author (whom I was under the impression was a shrubber), and because he held a power milker to my head, I decided to check it out. To my dismay, I can't say anything bad about it - it's a good fable, and I am impressed. Very funny."
2,At least I finished it,"(Kindle version)The first half of the book really wasn't too bad. Mr Laurie went a little over the top with the ""Hard Boiled"" style but not so thick that made it hard to follow. I mostly cared about the protagonist and the story moved along in a bit edgy but lighthearted way. Unfortunately the second half of the book bogged down with long, drawn out scenes that weren't believable and not lighthearted. The hard-boiled dialogue seemed a little out of place with the turn to seriousness that he introduced. The protagonist I thought I knew changed into an insensitive killer that made me wonder if I knew him at all.I half thought to give up on the story but by then I was 75% through it so decided to plod on. The ending did tie up for the most part but I found myself more relieved to have finished rather than satisfied with the conclusion. In summary I can't recommend.Thanks for reading the review."
4,A Real Treat for Hugh Laurie Fans!,"If you were a fan of the BBC's 'A Bit of Fry and Laurie,' with it's madcap Monty Python-esque humor, then Laurie's first novel will keep you howling with laughter. Laurie's dry British wit is to be found in abundance in this slightly off center thriller. Thomas Lang, a cynical ex-soldier, is approached by a man who wants to know if he would consider comitting a murder- the man's own. What follows is Lang's frantic, (and hilarious,) search to find out just who can be trusted. From dim-witted hit men to crabby police officers, to world arms dealers, 'Gun Seller' runs the gambit from heart stopping tension to laugh-out-loud humor. As the story progresses the humor does tend to take a backseat which is unfortunate. The plot is good but the book's strength relies on Laurie's irony, sarcasim, and ability to use the English language in print as well as he does in performance. More than worth a look if you're a fan of Laurie or if you enjoy well written comedy."
5,The only thing that can top this will be the audio version.,"This one is brand new, hot off the press in the U.S. and a terrific read. Billed as ""Bertie Wooster meets James Bond"" (N.Y. Times-glowing-Book Review), I though the reference had something to do with the fact that the author plays Bertie Wooster in the PBS series. Wrong. Laurie manages to merge the wit of a P.G. Wodehouse with the suspense of a Robert Ludlum and the derring-do of an Ian Fleming to produce...well, a Hugh Laurie. I was on the edge of my seat half the time - the other half I was regaling anyone within hearing distance with the funny bits. There are loads of them, along with intricate terrorist plots, deadly helicopters and a very satisfying ending. This is Laurie's first novel and I hope he is currently mopping the fevered brow over his next one"
4,It's a good read,"I really liked this book. It was funny, serious, complicated and fun. The first part of the book is relatively involved and there are plenty of twists along the way. The second part went by much quicker almost to the point where I wanted more. The ending was nice but almost abrupt. It is a great first effort by Mr. Laurie. I look forward to the possibility of this becoming a movie."
3,The Gunseller,"Not bad. Hugh Laurie does a good job of creating a likeable, not very nice bad guy. Almost like House, the doctor. It wasn't as good as other authors, but it was enjoyable. 3.5 Stars"
5,Twistedly Funny,You can tell from the first sentence of the book that it is written in the way that Hugh Laurie does his best humor. If you love watching House then this book is for you. You get the same type of humor and feel as his character on the show. It is a really good read. I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.
4,Complicated but good.,I chose this book because of the author. It is very good but also complicated and difficult to follow at times. Love the author's humor. Would read another of his books if there are any.
3,It was OK,"It started pretty good but then dragged on, like it should have been about 50 pages less. It was really just OK"
3,Hugh Laurie - great entertainer,"I have not read many modern day British authors, but I thought Mr. Laurie was too wordy at times. Maybe it was the story line that failed to intrigue me. Might read something by him of the satirical nature."
3,Not sure what it's trying to be,"Part of the time the story is lighthearted and silly, and part of the time it's earnest and grim. With so many earnest and grim but well-written thrillers out there, I'd have preferred more lightheartedness. Personally I thought the mood lurched more than shifted from one type to the other, and it wasn't clear if the book was spoofing thrillers or joining their ranks. It's unfair to compare the book to a Wodehouse work. Wodehouse stands alone. But on its own terms the book is a fine way to spend some time with Hugh Laurie."
3,Dr House I presume,"The whole time I was reading I could hear Dr. House reciting the lines. While the book was good, he came off a little too flip and snarky."
5,Pleasently Surprised,"I wasn't sure what to expect form Hugh Laurie. The main character in the book is very much like Laurie's ""House"" character in his sarcasm and intellect. The stream-of-consciousness writing got a little heavy-handed at times, but I really enjoyed the plot and characters. Would definitely give any future books a try."
3,Great fun!,"Hugh Laurie's wit made this a great read. My lack of understanding of British slang probably diminished some of the humor, but great fun nevertheless."
3,Hugh Laurie...............,"is the reason I read this, and it's definitely got some of his humor in the story. Takes a little more time getting to the point then you would always like, but humorously, usually, he gets there."
3,enjoyable light read,Picked this up from LibraryThing's Early Reviewers group. I was intrigued that Laurie had written a novel in this vein and decided to take a look. I quite enjoyed it. Not since HitchHikers Guide have I found that sense of straightforward (yet backhanded at the same time) humor that is displayed here.I have read international spy thrillers in the past but none with this enjoyably skewed sensibility. Recommended for a light read.
4,Hugh is a hoot!,"I should have guessed that Hugh Laurie would be a funny writer given his comedic history before 'House'. Clever twists on recognizable bits from the spy novel genre make this a very very fun read. Watch James Bond in the theaters, or watch some MI5 on Netflix, and then sit back and enjoy ""The Gun Seller""."
3,Lost me part-way through,"This book started off just wonderfully. I adore Wodehouse books, and Hugh Laurie has definitely nailed that style. I laughed a lot during the first half (or so) of the book. But then it gradually seemed to get more grisly and confusing, and I just felt it lost that initial ""fun"" tone of the spy spoof combined with Bertie Wooster. Maybe his next book will keep a lighter touch throughout."
4,A fun read!,"I bought this book after following House since the first season and becoming quite enamored with Hugh Laurie. The Gun Seller ended up being a wacky, funny book that I was sad to see end. I loved the James Bond-y around-the-world action and conspiracies. I look forward to The Paper Soldier, Laurie's sequel.The only criticism I have is that the novel started off a little slowly for me, and the first time I started reading the book, I ended up losing interest. Several months later I picked it up again and started over from the beginning - and I'm glad I did!"
5,Witty,"I detest spy novels. I loved this book. The Gun Seller is a witty, engaging, funny, serious novel--and somehow it manages to be all those at the same time. It begins lightly, and remains bouncy throughout, but as more and more plot threads get woven in, you find yourself caring about the main character and drawn into the plot before you realize it. It's funny without being corny, and serious without taking itself too seriously.There are lots and lots of characters and plot meanderings, but Laurie does a great job of keeping it all straight for the reader without being condescendingly blunt about it. I'd recommend this for anyone, even those who don't normally enjoy reading."
2,Is anybody in there?,"Okay, I want to know what happened? Did Hugh Laurie's brain go on vacation 2/3rds of the way through the book? When I sat down to read The Gun Seller I thought that it was fun, witty, and exciting. The sarcasm was fun for a while, but then it got irksome. It was a bit showy and over the top. Every paragraph and almost every sentence was hosed down with mockery. Then, about 2/3rds of the way through the sarcasm just stopped. There must have been a serious kink in his ridicule hose. Uh, where did Hugh go? It ended with all seriousness and down to business with a few chuckles here and there. Overall the book was an okay read, the story line was good, but I felt like he rushed the ending or overdid the beginning. I can't decide which."
2,Self-consciously daft and frequently labored,"This book starts funny but gets less funny as it goes on, not because the jokes aren't as good, but because they're pretty much the same. It's a little like watching a TV sit com (not a bad one) stretched to two and a half hours. Isn't variety the spice of life?"
5,A Gift,"An absolutely beautiful piece of work. These women, and Mohr, have provided a wonderful gift in this book. Few things compare to the images of these women full of life. My only recommendation, more. More photos, more women from a broader spectrum of ethnic backgrounds."
3,Very Good For A Mighty Cloud Fan,"I've had this album for years and refer back to it from time to time. Some of the songs were not their traditional style and just didn't have any power. There were several of their old time hits that brought back good memories, except Family Circle, which makes me sad because it reminds me of my mother's death. I love the part they added to ""None But The Righteous"", saying ""I love Jesus!"" Now, that was good. In my opinion this is a good album, but not great because you have to pick and choose."
4,dress up dress down,"The Cafu Lace-up is a good dress-up dress down show with some sporty flare. It is a comfortable walker. The only comment is that the heel cleats are a bit high, giving you the feeling that you are floating. It takes some time to get used too."
2,Not a good choice for the Kindle,"This is the type of blog that is not suitable for the Kindle. Nothing wrong with the content, but it has very short entries and many links that require you to use the Kindle's experimental web browser. I would advise checking out this blog on the Web and subscribing to it via an rss reader. Blogs like ReadWriteWeb and TVNewser, which are updated more often and include a lot of text, work better on the Kindle platform."
3,Money Yawnders,"Based on the nine reviews above, the real-life DC Spin Doctor may be plying his trade at amazon.com the way Jonah did in this novel, which, actually, happens to be a reasonably good read. The 3 typos I picked up on (e.g. ""soliders"" vs. ""soldiers"") clued me in on what overall appears to be a perfunctory effort in plot by the author and in detail by his acknowledged resources. I don't think Bobby DeNiro will pick up on this project."
3,Money Wanders wanders,"This has a great concept, and the first two-thirds are quite enjoyable. However, toward the end, it seems to lose its way. What I assumed to be the main plot -- the PR campaign for Vanni -- gets wrapped up abruptly, and other issues take the forefront. Unfortunately, I found those other issues less interesting, and more unlikely.Overall, not a bad book though."
1,Exorcism: overcome black magic with white magic,"i have read a lot of books simular, not that any of them are any better or any worse they all work the same. I really would truley like to find out more about the author and if at all possible an address to contact him.Thank you"
2,Sax Harness/bra,Size was large for a junior size. Straps were very thin nylon with inferior plastic buckles attaching to Sax. Would I trust this hook to hold the sax. No the mechanism is cheap and would break sooner than a cheap metal hook.I'll modify it with a stainless still hook. These guys should produce a product with stronger fool proof hook mechanisms to hold a Sax that costs well over 1000K.
4,One of the best Krokus albums,"Every song in the album is good, with ""Fight On"" and ""Hellraiser"" being very catchy.Although I agree Krokus do not write very complex songs, this is by far some of their best material.Marc Storace sounds very good, and the drummer is excellent.I found myself playing the songs over and over, I didn't get tired of listening to them."
5,Amazing Album!!,"This album is simply amazing. From the opening cut to the last song, this is pure hard rock magic. This is classic Krokus. Marc Storace sounds better than ever. This CD has not left my cd player in weeks!!! Old fans of Krokus, you will not be disappointed. Younger hard rock fans, you can hear what the 80's metal era was all about in every one of these songs. Straight ahead, no frills, excellent vocals, amazing guitars, drums, this has it all. I am not the type to write a review of an album but this one definitely deserves it!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I got this to hook up two desk top computers to my existing internet via ethernet cords, it does not work and will not configure for either computer, the power light comes on it is green and the dsl light comes on and is green, but the internet light does not come on at all and ITS JUST A WASTE OF TIME. Could have saved my money and just called my service provider to send my a new modem with 4 port ethernet and it would work."
3,"Good, but not enough","This book was the major reference for our course of Digital Control, but a lot of things are not well explained. Starting by Z-transforms: the book doesn't even mention the regions of convergence (ROC), there in no topic about Fourier series/transform (I had to buy Signals & Systems by Oppenheim to completely understand z-transforms) and the topics about Discretization methods of analogic controllers (Euler, Tustin, etc.) is a joke. The discrete PID controllers are also not well explained. If you are in need of a well rounded book about discrete control, Ogata is a nice option - and expensive, but if you need something more deep, don't buy it."
1,waste of money,tried all the recipes in this toy and most dont do much of anything also have to hold most of the parts as they dont stay up of there own accord kid is very disapointed and never asks to get it back out.
3,Good academic approach,"The book is very complete, with a lot of different types of electrical insulation for a lot of different applications. It covers almost everything in terms of insulation from low to high voltages. The approach gives the chemical, mechanical and electrical propreties, but it lacks on some practical approach. It is a more academic book, and contains few examples of application and tests (no photos at all). Besides that, it is a good book for developers, as could be useful for consulting different types of materials that can be used for electrical insulation applications."
2,LMech,"Everythiing is more than worth the price as long as you dont Touch the Thing. If you plan on sitting it on a table and playing it thru speakers BUY it, if you plan to hold it, Buy something else."
2,minuses outweigh plusses,"The sound quality of this CD player is pretty decent, and the bass boost works well too. Aside from that, there isn't much reason to buy it as oppose to spending five dollars more for a CD player with a skip-protection feature."
2,Adequate for basic listening and the price is right,"Bought this for a 9-year old who doesn't need a high-end CD-player. It works well for normal listening. Headphones sound good, bass-boost adds punch, and it can read CD-R/CD-RW which allows me to make compilations for her.The downside is it has no sip protection so the slightest tap on the case or even tilting of the case causes it to skip. The display seems a little dim also, but what do you expect for $13 ? If you want anti-skip protection then spend more for a player that has one."
2,could be better,"This actually works ok, the tubing is a plus, but the board itself could have been made bigger as it gets uncomfortable quickly"
2,board too small,I have tried this for two days. My knee hurts and I believe it is because the board is way too small. I didn't feel like I really worked my torso either. The resistance tubing was nice though. I am taking it back to the store.
1,"Bally system resistance bands and balance, twist board",It was very difficult to stay on the small dimension of this circular board. I would recommend another product.
2,Tough going,"I thought I was getting a more modern translation, but I got the 1960's one. It is helpful if you are really into the history of the early church, but the translator's anti-Roman Catholic bias was a little grating."
5,Early church,Terrific book about the early church when church growth was the fastest and greatest it has ever been. Great service from the supplier and the book is just what I needed.
3,The Early Church,"I find the writer hard to follow at times. All he seems to do is cite from other writers. There is not much ""new"". And, the book is heavily weighted toward the Catholic Church and is less than objective."
1,Cute but really Crappy!,"This outfit looks totally cute in the picture. However, it is difficult to put on your dog and does not stay on. It is mmade of thin, flimsy material. I am very upset and do NOT recremend the purchase of this product!"
3,Not what I thought,This turned out to be completely opposite of what I thought. It is a nice dog costume but the dogs have to wear it in the front not on their backs and its very hard to keep on a hyper dog!
4,It is far worst at present,"""Read The Green Belt, and you will find that more than three decades ago,Ngo The Vinh was already able to insightfully capture the situation in theCentral Highlands of Vietnam, caught as it was in all the tragiccircumstances of wartime, and to expose the roots of insecurity, whileshedding the light of compassion on the fate of its inhabitants, theThuong people. More than thirty years have gone by, but the condition ofthose ethnic groups has undergone almost no change, if not to say that itis far worse at present. The civilized world seems not to have fullyrecognized the consequences of the erroneous fixed ideas which contributedto the tragedies experienced by the Thuong people.(...)"
3,50 BLESSED years INDEED!!!!,"This CD is really Good. It captures the essence of Milton Brunson and the TCS! My personal favorites are Over and Over and Over, I really love you Lord, My mind is made up and my all time favorite Safe in his arms!!! If you have listened to the radio from 1980 to now, you'll love it. (gospel radio , ofcourse)This CD is a must-have! You would also like Milton B's greatest hits also, with songs like No failure , I tried Him, He cares 4 U and many others. Order it NOWWW!!!"
3,luv Milton Brunson..but cd was a little scratched,I did get the cd in no time..I played the cd and found it to be a little scratched Nevertheless I do luv anything(songs) by Milton Brunson and the THompson Community Singers
3,All The Men and Women of the Bible,"I did not get the book I ordered...I ordered All the Men and All the Women of the Bible and I got All the Men of the Bible. I would order from this person again if I could get the right book, or at least All the Women of the Bible."
2,"mistakes, mistakes, mistakes!!!!","this book tries to cover a lot of material by briefly explaining each topic. bad idea mr. farlow! whatever happened to quality over quantity? even if you are looking for a summary of different ways of solving pdes, this is not the book to buy. plus the practice problems at the end of each chapter stink. even if you attempt to solve them, the answers in the back of the book are about 40% wrong.also note that in the back of the book there is a ""pde crossword puzzle"". what is up with that? are we to expect that mr. farlow assumes the student using this book will be so bored with the material that they need a crossword puzzle to escape the pains of learning pdes?if anything it does have a nice set of fourier transform tables in the back of the book, but this kind of thing can be easily found elsewhere."
2,Not Even Worth the Low Price,"This book was required material for my Partial Differential Equations class and I can say that I am very dissatisfied by it. The questions at the end of each lesson are often poorly worded and can sometimes draw on information covered in a later lesson. The back of the book is such a poor reference that our professor told us not to look in it for answers due to possible mistakes.The plus side is its low cost, Lesson 5, and the PDE Crossword Puzzle in the back. These things don't really make up for the book though. I feel that I need to drop my physics major and become a mathematician so that I can write a new book to replace this one."
2,Elementary PDEs,"This book is a basic introduction to PDEs with an applied flavour. This is not really for math majors. It does not include enough exercises and the ones that it does have are easy. If you are into applied math then this may be the book for you. However, I don't recommend this book for theoretical math. Introduction to Partial Differential Equations by Donald Greenspan is not a difficult book and I recommend it for math majors. Also, it has enough exercises for good practice."
3,Too Supeficial,It never gets into the details of the matters. It gives just some examples. Not reccommended at all.
5,Great Reference,"This book is an ideal companion for a graduate, or undergraduate, course in partial differential equations. There are worked examples and very useful definitions throughout the text. Additionally, the text is written as lessons and any lesson can be read and understood without reading the previous lessons. The best part is that this book is an order of magnitude cheaper than most college level texts and is largely more valuable."
4,A handy lecture series that is easy to access,"This is a series of lectures that introduce partial differential equations for engineers and scientists. It is written clearly and carefully, using approachable language to build a conceptual understanding of the phsyical phenomena that inspire the mathematical approach.This probably won't satisfy people interested in applied mathematics, but engineers should find this a sensible approach. I'd suggest that this could be read alongside an advanced mathematics textbook and will aid the understanding, application and solving of many vital applied physics problems."
3,"stress ""for Scientists and Engineers""","One should take the ""for Scientists and Engineers"" portion of the title seriously. Everything covered in this text is strongly motivated from a physical applications point of view. The development is very readable and rigourous mathematics are generally avoided (even when they oughtn't be). A couple of notes for those who will use this as a text for an introductory course in PDEs: many of the end-of-lesson questions are irritatingly vague and qualitative for a math course, and also there are a staggering number of errors in the selected solutions at the back of the book. Last of all, keep in mind that it's a pure mathematician writing, and some of the things which irked me about the text may be exactly what is desired for it's intended audience, scientists and engineers."
5,An outstanding intuitive introduction to PDEs,This book is an excellent introduction to PDEs with an emphasis on how to understand the equation and interpret the solution.
2,Too Brief With Few Examples,"Having gotten the dover books on ODE and Advanced Calc, I was expecting the same quality of presentation here... I was disappointed. The book offers very little explanation about each sections use or simply how to use the equations. Each section was basically a derivation, but fails to give an example of how to use it. This makes it pretty much worthless, or at least a substantial waste of time, since you cannot be sure if you are doing it right. This book may be cheap, but its really not worth it."
2,Lacking,"I was assigned Farlow's PDE text for an introductory PDE course at the advanced undergraduate level. The course was tailored towards a mixture of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering students.From a math major point of view, this text lacks depth in its exposition. To reiterate prior buyers' comments, Farlow's exercises are largely trivial. Farlow introduces a wide range of material and concepts; he does not, however, develop them thoroughly enough to satisfy readers who expect and prefer greater mathematical rigor.I highly recommend Logan's intro text on PDEs (Springer 2004), especially for those possessing an advanced undergraduate mathematics background. Logan succeeds in all areas where Farlow fails--Logan is an all-around solid text. If you already have Farlow, pick up a copy of Logan as a supplement. You won't regret it."
5,VERY NICE,I looked for a affordable book on partial differential equations to teach myself partial differential equations for studying theoretical physics. This is a nice book.
5,Simply Great!,"The book is simple, interesting to read, just like a story book or a news article, and can be used as an introductory textbook for PDEs."
4,"Good reference, maybe","I bought this to help me out in my heat transfer course, where we had to deal with the heat equation. It's a good reference, but it is poorly organized. A real partial differential equations text would have been better."
4,Good book,"I used this book in an undergraduate course, and since I couldn't see the board during lectures, I relied on only the book and it was very easy to read and understand. The major drawback of this book, and I don't know if this accounts for it's abnormally low price, is that there seem to be far more errors in the solutions than most books have. About 100 pages into the book, I had encountered so many errors, that thereafter whenever my solutions were different from the solutions in the book, I wondered first if the book was wrong, not if I had done something wrong."
3,Not for beginners!,"This book samples practical applications in heat transfer, diffusion and other areas. There is not much background info with which to start. If you are new to this branch of math, this book is over your head (OK, speaking for myself, it is over MY little head). Start with a college textbook. Get into the theory, in-depth definitions, and general cases. Then go to this book for the practical cases.Be careful to read the beginning of this book without skipping ahead to the subject matter. In the beginning are key definitions of shorthand notations to be used throughout the rest of the book. If you skip the introduction, you won't know what Utt or Uxx mean.Conclusion: The bargain price is nice. I'd say the book is 80% clearly written, considering the murky subject. But it is not an ""Intro to"" text, by any means. I wanted to see more electrical & magnetic applications, but those are just my narrow targets."
5,very handy,"I've used these the past couple summers now and I'm very happy with them. I have two 4 footers and two 6 footers to hold the boat in place while it's in the slip. Since they stretch they take a lot of strain off the cleats that have spider webbed fiberglass surrounding them from just using a solid rope and getting beat up in windy conditions. They are also very useful when tying boats together to make a floating trailer park, or just docking to get some gas. I highly recommend all boat owners having at least a couple. You need ropes anyway, might as well get some bungees as well."
1,Not what I expected,I would recommend this rope for a larger vessel. It didn't help keep our boat in place at all. The rope stretched out after just a few uses
5,Great tie off for our boat!,We use this bungee to hold our inner tube on the back of our 22 foot boat. It keeps the tube in place while we are not using it and is very easy to detach from the cleat when it is time to slip the tube in the water.
5,"Great Product, Very Happy with it, great price","This is a great little bungee. I use it on a 21 ft wakeboard boat at the lake, works well, would be ideal if you had two for the front and the back of the boat. Fits around the cleat and is snug because of the little plastic sleeve."
1,Blatant false advertisement,Don't be fooled by the description. Both batteries came are labled 1000 mah. Yet on the receipt and web page it says 1400 mah. This is false advertisement and illegal. Buy at your own risk.
2,Nothing new,"All information this book provides can also be found on the internet at no cost. just by using a searchengine you can have the same help and its faster.I was looking for a help to build forms using PHP and mysql, also for some new ideas how to do things.Unfortunately not in this book. Have to keep looking"
5,Sandi Patty does it again!,"Once again, Sandi Patty has managed to create a fantastic, inspiring CD--nothing out of the ordinary for her, of course! The song ""Solo El Amor"" is beautiful, though *none* of the songs on this album are bad. A definite must-have for any Sandi fan!"
4,Add this to your collection,"Sandi Patty's ""These Days"" CD kicks off with ""Wouldn't Trade it for the World,"" which rocks a lot more than you usually hear from Sandi. As you listen to the electric guitar on that first track, don't miss the important message in the lyrics.As a Mom myself, I can't help but be moved by ""All This Time"" dedicated to Sandi's oldest daughter, Anna, who is now grown up. (Does anyone else remember Sandi's vinyl album, ""Songs from the Heart,"" which featured photos of baby Anna and the cut, ""Cradle Song""...? How time flies.)""These Days"" is another lovely collection of songs."
5,"God has truly blessed this vocalist, and in turn, me!","I heard my first Sandi Patty album (and yes, I mean LP) nearly 20 years ago. With each anticipated release (and nearby concert appearance) I have never been disappointed. The release of ""These Days"" continues this remarkable artist's journey. No matter what musical or vocal style Sandi chooses, she ends up owning it! This release challenges the devout fan of Sandi's high note endings to remain with her as she embarks on a new journey. Her vocal flexibility and stylistic versatility are put to the test, all the while, never losing the ability to turn a phrase as no one else can! Sandi Patty has been a blessing for many years in my life, and I pray that she will continue for many years to come. True Sandi fans will see this release for what it truly is - art in its highest form!!"
1,Misleading Information for Products,"I ordered this product thinking that it was a 15ft chain ( because that's what the picture showed) because there was no mention of the length in the description.Then I recieved a 10ft chain for my order. When I e-mailed the seller they informed me that The product code was for a 10ft chain not a 15ft even though the picture was of the 15ft. They blamed it on amazon and said if I paid to mail it back then they was give me a 15ft on instead. I then e-mailed back and explained that it was not in any way my error and I souldn't have to pay for postage back and had asked for a pre postage self addressed envelope. And they just never did any thing not ever responded. Very unhappy with this seller ,the product is not what was advertised and very misleading and sneaky."
1,Junk,My dog was well under the recommended weight and broke it within a few days. I bought a solid cable that has a plastic coating and couldn't be happier!
5,For the dog on the go...,"Great little bag for dog stuff transport. My dog is only 17lbs so this bag will hold enough food for two weeks. When I am only gone for a weekend I can put his food in a small bag and put the food, 2 small bowls, a small bottle of water, treats and a leash (just about everything but the dog bed) all inside and toss it in my suitcase. The best part is that by the time you come home and the food is gone it takes up less space in your suitcase."
5,very sturdy product - ready for action,"I am used to using the 4-sided open bottom graters found at the supermarket or the OXO grater with just two sides. This is so much better. It has a bottom so you can keep everything you grate inside and then dump it all in the bowl at once. It is also very sturdy so you can lean over it to get leverage when grating big hunks of cheese. So far, I have only used 3 out of the 6 sides."
3,Box Grater Performance,"I have a couple of Microplane graters, but wanted a good all purpose box grater for those times that the food processor was too much. This grater seems very well made, however, I was a bit disappointed in how sharp it was. This may be due to using Microplane graters for smaller jobs and could be skewing my perception of ""sharp"". I mainly wanted it for the coarse and julienne options. the julienne side didn't really do what I consider a julienne strip using a carrot, it pretty much just grated it. For the price, I would say it is worth it, but a bit disappointed in how it performs."
2,BEWARE: Reformulated Tissue Quality Slipping!,"Kleenex tissues *used* to be great, but alas, no more. I was in for a rude shock when I bought this ten pack in January. As my (previous) brand of choice a ten pack is more economical, but not when the quality has sunk so low. I need (at least) two tissues to replace the thickness of the prior tissue before reformulation. Now when I blow my nose, the tissue cannot even stand up to it. I have donated the tissues to my sons school. Be forewarned, I am writing this to get the word out; but who reads up on tissues before you buy them. You buy what you know works...only this time it doesn't.I will need to find a new tissue."
1,not good for runny nose,"try to blow your runny nose, your face will be covered with %$#% liquid. this tissue is like water proof, it does not absorb liquid well.and shake it little bit, you will see so much dust. baaaaaaaaaad quality."
2,Lint from Kleenex tissues,Kleenex tissues 200 count are generating lots of lint when pulled from box. The lint appears to be in the boxes along with the tissues
1,overpriced,just bought this product- 1 box of 200 count at local HEB store for $1.49. The price this company wants is a ripoff.
3,Strange Odor,"The boxes were in good shape when they arrived (not damaged like you sometimes find in bulk packaging), and the tissues themselves are strong, soft and good quality as you'd expect to find with the Kleenex brand. My only problem with them is the smell. Each tissue has a very strong odor that I can't really even describe. It's not bad enough to keep me from using them, but it is very strong. It seems to be dissapating a little as they sit open out of the packaging, but I can still smell it. Hopefully it's nothing harmful. I got the package of 10 boxes and the smell is in every box. I've never encountered this before when I've bought these tissues in other ways."
1,Kleenex needs to clean up its act,"It seems that anything good gets discontinued rather quickly. Kleenex 160 2-ply was the perfect box. And this item is so pricey, I cannot believe that Amazon.com is promoting it."
2,Great product at a bad price,"Kleenex brand tissues are excellent. However, the price at which they are being offered plus shipping costs makes this offering a pretty lousy deal. These can be had for much less locally, so unless you just have to have them shipped for some reason, save your money."
5,Good...Although two of the Songs are on my Ipod...,"My favorite songs are ""Cu Chullain"" and ""Math was a Wizard"". Cu Chullain is a good song for a ballet performance.By the way, I own these two songs on my Ipod!Meghan :)"
3,Not going to please everyone...,"A book like this is never going to please everyone, least of all the highly contentious and constantly pushing/shoving metal underground, where a rite of passage is learning the unofficial ""history"" of different genres. Still, it's good enough for people new to these forms of music and offers some interesting new information from personal interviews. Trivia, maybe, but most of this is just the history of developing artists and the ""sound"" they were working with, so it's interesting in that way, and music lovers who are new to these forms of metal will probably have their enjoyment deepened by a little understanding. Any work that acts to remove chunks of the dominant misunderstandings and misinterpretations of metal musicians is worth it, in my opinion. Check it out."
2,A biography on Napalm Death,"Any book that doesn't credit bands like Death, Possessed, Morbid Angel and even Slayer (Hell Awaits) as starting death metal is just not accurate. This book is written non-objectively from an obvious fan of Napalm Death."
5,Great Book!!! Get this!,This is by far the most accurate and detailed account of a extreme music movement. This book does not only educate but entertains and inspires the reader to dig deeper in the Death Metal genre.
5,A great read,"As a death metal fan, I found this book to be very insightful as it becomes rather difficult over time to remember all the members of bands long since past, it helps bring them back into the light to a new generation of metal heads. I don't read much, but once I got this book, I read it in a matter of days, it's that good! Many would think that a book with this kind of topic would lack comical retorts, but I would have to say the Glen Benton interview damn near made me spit pop across the room! If you're a metal head, or looking into becoming one, you should read this and see where the roots of death metal are...you might be surprised!"
5,Choosing to read Choosing Death...,"Well, it covers the main bands at all the major points of interest... a more definitive book would need to be a very big book so this is pretty good for the broad strokes with some nice bits of horse's mouth info to flesh it out... fills in a few gaps in the average info base of the less fanatical grind core/death metal fan. I'm certainly glad I got it and that it was written. Can't wait for the definitive (and big, it better be a besser block of a thing or else it wouldn't even come close) tome to be released once someone with the nouse gets it done.Think that covers it.Go git it.Now."
5,Love it,"A great journey into the death metal world, a must read for death metal fans, lots of info from obituary, cannibal corpse, swedish death scene, napalm death and many more death bands!"
5,Violent femmes at their best!!!,"This cd shows the wide range of instuments the band can play, and play well. They cover every topic you can think of, from drugs to angels, from dancing to Jeffery Dahmer. Although the album is relitivly short, (less than 40 minutes) they really pack alot of music into it."
1,Not the best,"I had never heard of Furtado, chose this CD to check him out.Won't buy any more by this artist."
2,about book,"Its not as described,I was waiting for more natural treatments ,but the book always refer to prescribed medications as treatment."
5,Great book on osteopenia!,This book is a must read for all mom's and for women that want to prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis. The book walks you through the steps of preventing a disease that many assume just happens. I have completely changed our diet. Easy to follow and good information.
2,TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION,"If you have osteopenia, read this book with a healthy dose of skepticism. Osteopenia is NOT osteoporosis, although it could lead to that. Many of the patients cited in the book have been prescribed osteoporosis drugs, even though they don't actually have full-blown osteoporosis. Readers need to take into consideration that the author, Dr. Harris McIlwain, is on the clinical faculties for 16 different drug companies, a fact made part of his bio on another book. Some of these drugs are very expensive and can have serious side effects."
3,Disappointed,My fault - it did not state the date published and while it is helpful - it needs to be updated - probably why I got it for a reduced price!
5,Love,One of the best chapter in the book is on love. It is a must-read. It echoes what has been said by other wise men.
1,Uneven all around,"It is impossible to understand Hedges's point on homosexuality. Why be a stickler on the ten commandments if you are going to tolerate the sin of homosexuality (Romans 1:26-27) as he seems to me to do. Also, he admits Saddam killed tens of thousands of Kurds but seems to be saying going into Iraq or at least staying was wrong. For your info Hedges our taking down Saddam caused Libya's Khadafi to abandon his nuclear bomb project, fearing he (Khadifi was next)."
5,Credentials Daily 02,This is an excellent product which is not greasy. It has no irritating scent and produces great results. It is well worth the price.
3,Would have been five stars if the plastic were of higher quality,"The shears are sharp and have a great ergonomic design. My complaint: during their first use, the loop of the handle cracked with not much pressure. In my opinion, the plastic is of inferior quality. I will try gluing the pieces and hope it does not happen again."
1,Good while it lasted,"These scissors worked well for almost a year of cutting grocery store flower stems. Then the spring popped out and never fit into place properly after that. I'm sorry to say, this is the most disappointing OXO product I've used. I've order a pair of Fiskars flower shears as a replacement."
5,Draconian Esoteric Music from the High Priests of Morpheus,"Dispel immediately any rumors floating through certain circles about this album having a ""flaw""; to even couple this bible with so pedestrian a word is a laughable offense. Hark, ye giants of metal, summon your benevolent army of atmospheric warriors to toil endlessly in praise of this work. Let the sirens play with the strings of the rainbow, in a harmonious elegance: The Story of a King. Dark Romanticism and Ancient memory team up for a delightfully moody romp! As seen in Richard Simmons' Never-Say-Diet! Cookbook."
5,Fantastic pop gems!,"Take indie-pop sense, add a touch of 'real cut and paste' beats (some sound like there was scotch tape on the loop or the needle) and add some warm vocals and you get Catskills. The loops and sounds vary from soul, R&B and an interesting choral sample (on ""My Head Falls Softly."") The songs have a nice warm tone, thanks to the layered vocals (of which you can barely understand a word, but that's not a big issue.) I still want to know where Ms. Valfer's fascination with basketball terms comes from... (""Top of the Key,"" ""Charity Stripe,"" and ""Half Court Press"" off her last album."""
5,Worth the Wait,I felt like I got a great buy for my money. The product is hard to locate in most grocery stores in the package sizes I received in my order. My family loves this stuff.
3,"Not a healthy snack, tastes a bit like burnt bread","First off, I do like dark rye bread, but these taste a bit like burnt flatbread. If you like the taste of MSG, you might enjoy them. I will say that Gardetto's snack mix is a guilty pleasure of mine, but these rye chips simply do not taste good enough, imo, to consume alone.Despite the description stating they are a ""healthy snack,"" they are not healthy whatsoever! They are nothing more than fried refined carbs with artificial flavors and preservatives. A 1/2 cup serving contains 160 calories (90 from fat), 10g of fat (2g is saturated and a whopping 3g per serving is trans fats), 340 mg of sodium, 16g of carbs, and 2g of protein. One bag contains 4.5 servings."
1,"""Healthy snack""?????","The current description states ""Healthy snack."" I agree that these are definitely delicious, but they are in no way healthy! They contain 2.5g of Trans Fat!!! (The 2nd ingredient is Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil. They also contain MSG, BHT, caramel color, and some other questionable ingredients.The taste may be 4 or 5 stars, but the nutrition is negative 10! At least they are honest with their labeling. Most companies would reduce the serving size so that it came to less than 1/2g of trans fat per serving and slap a ""trans-fat free*"" label on the front to deceive the consumer.I stumbled upon these while searching for organic ingredients to make my own ""healthy"" snack mix. These used to be one of my favorite parts of the mix...so disappointed!!!"
2,Shipping issue,"This is the second purchase that I have made of this same product, from you, in the past six months. The first purchase went without a problem. The second, however, arrived with one of the bags being opened. There were chips in the box and oils used in the preparation of the chips had soaked into the cardboard box used for shipping as well as the other eleven bags. Apparently, more care needs to be exercised when packing the box for shipping or more careful examination of the product needs to happen prior to shipping."
3,"Great Taste, Horrible For You","5 stars for taste, 1 star for the trans fat content.These are one of the best tasting, addictive snacks I've ever had, but it's a good thing they're not easily available. Their trans fat content is surprising and disappointing; it makes this snack a treat to be enjoyed only very occasionally. I look forward to them, hopefully, adjusting the recipe to eliminate the trans fats."
5,These rock!,I love these chips! Usually I mix a bag of these into each bag of the regular mix to get a better ratio. Then the idiots at my local store stopped carrying these (getting rid of great products seems to be their speacialty). Now I have an Amazon subscription set up so I'll get a regular delivery of tasty chips!
1,MAG KEY HOLDER - YOU WILL BE SORRY!,"I installed one on a brand new car two weeks ago and when I went to grab the key holder yesterday the only thing left was the magnet. No broken bits or parts just a clean separation between the key holder and the magnet. Spent 40 bucks for the key, two bucks for the holder and now I have to buy them again! Don't buy this you will be sorry!! Nice design but doesn't work. Buy the old fashioned metal box type that is riveted on and it will never disaper."
2,Poor Quality,"We bought this in January 2011 and we were happy with it at first. It is comfortable, the depth marking lines are useful, and the serrated edges are great for opening bags of garden soil. However, after 6 months of light use the whole handle broke off while digging a small hole in soil. I will be purchasing a different brand as a replacement."
2,End of Grip broke-off,"I enjoyed this tool until now. The end of the grip broke-off. I didn't abuse it, just poor workmanship. Don't buy the OXO Good Grips Gel-e Gardening Trowel 16075"
5,Great book!,"Great book for any audio engineer, from someone just starting in the business to the seasoned engineer. Good reading for musicians as well. The book is similar in style to Harvey Penicks Little Red Book. Short useful pieces, the kind of book you can pick up and read for 10 minutes, and you will have learned something.Good book to keep on the gig!A nice blend of humour mixed in with the knowledge and experience from the bar band circuit in Canada to touring with Van Halen,Aerosmith and many others.I really enjoyed this book!"
1,Disappointing ...,"Disappointing book literally made up of road scrapbook notes of a sound engineer. I could not even get passed the first half of the book by lack of interest.Jim is certainly a veteran of live sound. But this book is really missing the point to transmit great histories, specific experiences or teaching live sound techniques.Maybe would have benefited to be co-written with the intent to have attractive content for the young professionals?"
1,"Special Coating makes it yellow, NOT invisible!","Product description claims,""Special coating makes light invisible to bugs, so they are not attracted!"" Totally untrue, bugs are just as attracted to this bulb as they are to regular light bulbs.I have been using this product for two months and I am very dissatisfied. I read the three other reviews that claim that these bulbs work great, maybe I have unique insects that can see this ""invisible"" light because my porch gets just as many bugs (moths, spiders, beetles, etc.) now as it did before when using regular bulbs."
2,NOT SURE IT'S WORTH THE PRICE,all balck and white pictures and many of the same items pictured.price list is so so.would ahve been more interesting if there would ahve been stories of the father collecting or something.
5,sweet and touching,"This was a funny and sweet story about two people falling in love, but also having to negotiate their lives within the demands of their families. I found it to be an incredibly enjoyable and fast read."
2,A Bad Hair Day and A Bad Book!,"I honestly don't know why I even finished this book, I really couldn't get into it from the beginning and I never did. The second I heard them refer to Esther Williams more than once, I should've known.The book takes place in a VERY small southern town with not much going for it rather than a Trav'O'Tel, car museum, a long family feud. The two families were all but a few people left in the town and pathetic attempt at the Hatfields and the McCoys. Of course the new generation of the two families were a divorced woman who owned the local hair salon, which she took all too seriously, and a handsome man she lusted after for 20+years. Of course these two get together in a Romeo and Juliet sense and bring the families together and end the feud. That's about the entire, slow paced book in a nut shell."
5,Great Value,They pack a lot of power into this affordable little bottle. Mushrooms are actually good fungus for us that can help fight off bad fungus like candida.
2,"A Tribute? No, a dub gone wrong.","I think the CD is genuinely meant to be enjoyable, but with the title ""A tribute to Whitney Houston"", one expects more than this CD offers. Whomever the singer may be, she tries to be a Whitney Houston duplicate which she is not. She should have put her own emotions into the song and should have became the song, rather than try and sing it as Whitney would. The singer has a beautiful voice, but she should have tried harder to be more ""herself"" than like Whitney. The musical scoring and background tracks were very close to the originals and I would have been very impressed by that; except for the fact that the overall quality and engineering of the album was terribly poor. I think that your average buyer would pick up this CD thinking it to be a masterpiece, and would take it home to be sadly mistaken. Sorry."
1,Have mercy on this CD!,"A masacre of butchered music from talented artist have been used to make these tribute CD. This is not the only tribute CD out, there are those of Mariah Carey and Britney Spears. This person should have quit while she was ahead because her voice is not getting any better attempting to ruin the songs of talented artists. This girl in know way sounds like Whitney yet alone of urban desent. A 64 pinto with is mufler falling off sounds way better than this. This girls voice can't compete and it is sad that she would atempt to make this mockery a funny joke. The only thing funny about this is the fact that this girls voice is horrible. Her voice is as bad a rotting orange peel except much worse. I hope Whitney never hears this because she's probably be ashamed. Even Whitney with all her ""PROBLEMS"" still sounds better than this untalented girl. Go spend you money on somthing worth wild. Listen to the clips if you don't believe me."
5,My three most favorite books of all time...,"I disagree with B. Borden's review of these books. These three books are my three favoirte books of all time. Killer Angels is absolutely the best. The writing style in Gods and Generals seemed so close to the Killer Angels that you would think it was the same author. The books cross-reference one another. After reading Gods and Generals I had to read Killer Angels again and it just FLOWED so smoothly! The Last Full Measure gave me a sense of closure by completing the saga. I would probably give The Last Full Measure 4 stars, not quite as much of a page-turner as Killer Angels and Gods and Generals, but still VERY good reading. (My wife makes fun of me because I had a few teardrops roll down my cheeks reading the end of The Last Full Measure)."
5,Civil War Trilogy,"I read all three books and I thought they were amazing. I learned more about the Civil War through these books than through any history class I have ever taken. You will actully feel you know these characters and when one dies you will feel the pain. My favorite character was Joshua Lawernce Chamberlin. You follow him from when he volunteers for the army until the end of the war. You will also follow Lee, Longstreet, and Jackson for the Confederates. You follow Buford, Hancock, Grant, and of course Chamberlin for the Union.It is a story or normal men caught up in amazing times. It is an epic journey through America's darkest period when friends fought friends, when brothers fought brothers, and when Americans fought Americans."
5,The Civil War Trilogy - Shaara,"Although I learned a lesson about trying to have multiple books sent straight to the prison; I was happy that the problem was quickly resolved. I reordered and when the original order was returned, Amazon quickly reimbursed the original order. Happy, Happy, Happy.Shawna Nash(423) 315-6905"
3,The series..... it didn't FLOW,"Although these books are easy reads which can educate you quickly in the civil war, the trilogy as a whole didn't flow. The Killer Angles was a SPECTACULAR book, but hte authors son had a totally different view than his father. ONe of the most noticable faults of this book was how each author viewed General Longstreet and General Jackson. Well the author of The Killer Angles painted Longstreet as the Man who was Lees dependable man, someone who was blamed by everyone for picket's charge except for Lee (who knew it was HIS fault, and that Longstreet was right and he was wrong). While in the other books Lee is always blaming Longstreet and holding him in contempt, one cannot see how Lonstreet is Lees ""old war horse in these books"". Instead Lee is always regreting over Jackson's death. Unfortunatly his son couldn't hold the novels the way his father could, and because of their differences in style and views of the Civil War the series doesn't flow the way it should."
4,Great book but a sad reminder.,A great read but a sad reminder of the most brutal and devastating time in our nations history. I think this book(s)should be read by our young people who probably dont hear much about the civil war. They wil be in for abig surprise when they compare those deadly times with todays small minded whining about taxes and handouts.
5,Brings the Civil War to Life!,"An outstanding series on the Civil War period. I finally understand how our countrymen endured such tragedy. It is not a history series but a series of Novels, based on fact. Killer Angels is the best of the three."
1,So very very wrong,"If you want to read Civil War fiction, read ""The Killer Angels,"" but don't waste your time with the other books. This remains fiction, and far too many people accept this as truth when it is rife with inaccuracies. Read a real book by someone like Bruce Catton, not some novel that takes huge liberties with the material."
5,A very personal perspective of the civil war,"Read Killer Angels first, then Gods and Generals followed by The Last Full Measure. The Authors put a very personal edge to historical players of our nation's civil war. In many cases, I couldn't wait to pick the book up again because I longed for the relationship with the characters."
1,More Hype less Substance,"The women's movement brought us a lot of well constructed books that considered the problem of gender relations in a serious light. The men's movement has done the same. Both movements spawned a number of books and ""experts"" that were, essentially, poor and opportunistic works. The Men's Room is one of these opportunistic pop-psychology books. There is little substance to this work other than the usual trite admonishments that men need to get in touch with their feelings and need to relate to women in a way that women want. Nothing is said of the needs of men or of a gender role sharing of committment and intimacy within a relationship either between men and women or between men and men in the wider community. This genre of writing does nothing to enhance understanding of the masculine identity. There are many other good books that do.....read them instead."
2,slightly disappointed,"Yes, it was alright, but I thought it could have been a little bigger. I do not know much about black onyx so maybe the price was right. I could not find a womens black onyx ring in any stores where I am from so it may my search easier. Also, my wife loves heart shaped things so it should work out. I am gving it too her for Christmas."
4,A high school teacher likes this book,"I have used this book in my C++ class to create C++ programming assignments in graphics mode. For example, I have asked my students to draw a base circle on the screen. Then draw a set of circles each one with a center on the base circle and tangent to a fixed diameter of the base circle. The result is a BEAUTIFUL design whose outline is a famous curve--a nephroid. This assignment would be impossible without this book. This book has descriptions of several ways to draw scores of interesting and curious curves. It is a classic for anyone who will work hard to understand the math and wants to graphically construct symmetric designs. I have two copies and am looking for more to give as gifts to my talented students."
3,no bargain at amazon,"I always check Amazon for items I wish to purchase to see if they are available at Amazon and qualify for Amazon Prime. This boot does not qualify for Amazon Prime and is priced significantly less at Boot City.I won't know if the boots are any good until I receive them and may get back with feedback on that later. But sorry Amazon, you let me down and forced me to shop elsewhere."
1,Not Helpful Information,"This book was a peresonal journey of one woman with Scleroderma. However the title gives the impression you are going to receive medical and practical information in dealing with the illnesss. This is not the case. It is misrepresented by the title. This book is all about a woman's belief in a ""healer"" Yet she used every medical opportunity to treat herself. I really wanted to throw this book across the room while reading it. It offered no valid information. It just read as if she was absolutely crazy. And worst there was no information about the means of ""healing"" from this person. It was all vague ""you'll know what's right"" and you have to find the right healer rhetoric. This book should be catagorized as fiction. What a disappointment."
1,reclamo,"la tienda no me entrego el producto alegando que yo lo devolvi .fueron unos inresponsables ,y da pena que sean vendedores en amazon una tienda tan confiable"
2,Not Leak Proof,"I have this and it keeps things hot long enough, but a few times already, it leaks too much when it it gets knocked over. So now I'm looking for something leak proof. I probably will look for the same brand since I have several products by Thermos that works great on keeping heat and coldness. I have 3 hydration bottles and 2 food jars.I didn't think I really needed leak proof when I purchased this tumbler. But today my daughter knocked it over and spilled coffee on someone's papers.I don't recommend this. Get leak proof, then you don't have to worry about other people knocking hot, sticky (unless I drink tea), liquid all over the place."
3,Keeps drinks hot/cold long - but lid doesn't impress,"I bought two of these sight-unseen based on my personal experience with a theromos bottle in the same brand line. I am pleased with the temperate performance but have negative feelings about the lid. In my experience travel tumblers and mugs with screw-on lids have the advantage of not being prone to leakage and having the lid come off inadvertenly. The lids on these tumblers are push-on with a rubber gasket. If you pick the tumbler up by the lid the lid will come off - spilling hot liquid in your lap or where ever. As I said, I bought them without seeing them. Had I known about the lid I would not have purchased. Be aware."
3,ok,its a good product but not good in shipping..came with a piece out of the lip of the lid. but a great product anyway.
2,"Good insulated cup, poor lid design...POP!","My husband liked this cup for awhile. BUT the lid has a poor design in which it is held on by a thin rubber gasket and it pops off with very little effort. Tonight, he showed me it popping up with nothing in the cup. You just push it down, and POP! it comes right back up. Very poor design for a travel mug lid!"
2,"Lid pops off, makes this not a worthwhile buy","I love Thermos brand, especially since their products really do keep hot drinks hot and cold ones cold for hours. And the lids are the easiest to clean- since they come apart you can wash them and prevent disgusting-smelling mold from growing in lid, which happens easily with other cheaper brands.I bought this model and it was great for about a month, but now, the lid, which is a pop on/off style, won't stay on. It pops off every few seconds. It never was too secure, but now it won't stay on at all. Of course I first discovered that when I was driving and took a sip only to have my whole smoothie spill all over me and my car.I'm now looking for one that has a screw-on top model."
5,Great mug!!!!!!!,I received 2 mugs 3 yr ago from my daughter and just purchased 2 more. They keep your coffee hot for hours. I just ordered additional tops as the older mugs were starting to show ware. The tops are only $2.50 each. I use them ever day. Great mug!!!!!
3,Lip design has changed,"I have an older version of this product, and the lip was very pleasant for drinking from (without using the black plastic lid). This made the tumbler more versatile, and I used it a lot for all types of drinks.The current version has a different lip design, and is nowhere near as good from drinking from, without using the black plastic lid."
4,"Great cup, small flaw","This cup keeps coffee warm for hours!! Haven't tried cold liquids yet. The only flaw is the lid doesn't have a vent so when you drink your coffee trickles out. If you slightly close the sliding lid it does come out better but too slow for my liking. I would still recommend this cup, the rubber panels for the grip are awesome and work great with or without gloves."
2,"Some great qualities, but it's bad qualities are very, very bad!","Thermos generally makes excellent quality, durable products. This mug keeps hot liquids very hot and cold liquids very cold, for a long time. Also, the tab over the drinking hole is detachable so you can clean out the sludge buildup. Most importantly, it has a stainless steel interior. Plastic interiors retain flavors and make drinks taste terrible. Unfortunately, the lid just slides off an on, really easily. So when this wobbly mug tips over, the lid comes out and the coffee follows. If you lie the mug on its side, tie a thread to the lid, and tie the other end of the thread to a centipede, the centipede will have no problem pulling it off. I tested this. After pulling the lid off with ease, the centipede yawned sarcastically. This type of lid is much less costly for them to manufacture. I would have paid a few bucks more for a screw-on lid. Don't waste your money."
2,"Excellent insulation, horrible lid","I've been a fan of Thermos products for a while and when I got a new car (and my old thermos mugs no longer fit) I went to Thermos for a replacement. Purchased these and at first I thought they were pretty nice. They do an INCREDIBLE job of keeping cold things cold, and hot things hot. BUT, the lid has gotten to the point that it falls of at the drop of the hat, even when drinking. Reaching down to the cup holder takes care so as not to bump the lid off. Drinking from the cup takes care as not to tip the lid off. They have become almost worthless because of the ease at which the lids pop off.I do not recommend these.I gave it two stars only because of how well they insulate. But, they are not worth anything more because of the massive lid design problem."
1,Dangerous & Defective Lid,"While the mug keeps things hot, it can't keep things inside of it. This mug has a lid that just pops off. Put anything above 100 degrees in here and within a few minutes the seal pops off and if you happen to be drinknig it, the hot liquid falls all over you."
2,My thermos travel mug,"I bought this mug because it had the THERMOS brand name. It does a terrific job of keeping the coffee hot. However, it is terrible at letting you actually get the coffee into your mouth. The slide lid does not regularly open the air hole so sometimes you get nothing and next time you get a mouth full of hot liquid. You never know what you are going to get when you tip, either a tiny, tiny sip or a burned mouth. They need to throw this lid away and start new. I cannot believe it is still on the market."
2,Leaky lid,"Keeps beverage hot or cold very well, but the lid, while secure on my tumbler, leaks severely from under the slide-valve when the tumbler is tipped on its side. It even allows the beverage to slosh out of the top if the tumbler is jostled. Not much good for a travel mug. Might be okay at the desk (if you don't knock it over)."
1,Never could get my computer to recognize this player,"I have a 2 gb player, which I like. I wanted a player with more capacity, so I ordered the 8 GB model. I tried charging the device but it never seemed to take a full charge. When I attached the device to my computer, I got a message about invalid drivers for the device. I looked at their online support and tried their suggestions, but it didn't help. I talked to Creative Zen phone support many times, they seemed to be more interested in getting rid of me rather than helping me. They would send me emails suggesting solutions and hang up as quickly as they could. I updated Windows, motherboard drivers, changed registry settings, cleaned the drive and reset the device, all to no avail. I returned one device and got another, just to see if the first device was defective. It didn't help. I tried the phone support again, and they sent me the same emails I got before. I finally gave up and am now looking at other higher capacity devices."
1,BATTERY REPLACEMENT?,I gave this a low rating because after about a year the battery would not recharge and I could not find any information about battery replacement.I went to the Creative Technology website and nothing came up when I tried to search for Zen V Plus battery replacement.To me the inability to replace the battery is a major issue. What? They expect you to throw it away when the battery dies?
2,"Creative, not so","In all fairness this player was defective. I did like the features and the size of this player, when it did work. However, the support is not good at all. There is no 800 number to call and all questions are answered by email. The process takes 24 hrs. If you don't receive a positive answer, you need to wait for another response, another 24 hrs. This is irritating. This player has a long way to go, but when the bugs are satifactorily corrected it will probably be very popular.CREATIVE produces a very good sound blaster.AMAZON,s return policy is terrific."
3,Creative Zen V Plus 8 GB Portable Media Player,Although the Zen V is a cool little player...the buttons are tiny and hard to use. The display is also small as well as low res. which makes it hard to see.But the software it comes with was excellent and so was the sound. I sent mine back because it was too small to use. I then bought a iriver CLIX gen 2 which has a better interface and great screen.
1,Very disapointed,"Thought this would be a good deal, 3 pots and 1 pan for $50. When they arrived, the pots were all mis-shaped, none of the lids fit, and the pan was well scratched. Clearly, this was not a good investment, and was returned as quickly as it was recieved."
2,Disappointed,"This set was disappointing. Both saucepans and the skillet were badly damaged, as if the box were dropped on end from the top of a building. The stock pot and lids are lightweight, flimsier than I expected. And because all of them were to some degree oval instead of round, none of the lids fit properly. Several of the pots and lids also had minor cosmetic flaws in finish and/or small scratches.This seemed like a set of ""seconds"" quality, and since I wasn't willing to risk another set in the same condition, sent them back for a refund. Overall, I decided that it would be better to go shopping in a store where I could check the set for flaws or damage, pick them up, see how they feel. For the money, not such a great deal."
3,Ok product for your money,"If you purchase these pans there are some things to be aware of. The larger sauce pan lid did not fit the pan properly leaving gaps. The small sauce pan was heavier than most of the larger pans. Also the handles and lids got very hot. There is no safe way to hold the handles without a hot pad. Something I have always been able to do with my other pans. I have used these pans for a few weeks now, they cook evenly and the clean up is a breeze. If you are a first time buyer, you get a good product for your money. If you are looking to expand your cookware, this isn't for you. I really have enjoyed cooking with the frying pan and the stock pot except for the things I mentioned. Hope this helps anyone looking to buy."
1,No sound,Halfway thru the movie the sound cuts out and is gone for the rest of the video.The first half was great.
2,Falls Short,"Well......have you ever seen a preview for a movie that has an extremely good plot and you can't wait to see it. You finally see it and the director falls short of delivering what could have been the best movie you have ever seen. You want to like it, but just when you are about to, it falls short. That describes this game. The premise is fantastic but is basically a 3D version of Mario Brothers. It is very linear/scripted, you can't interact with your environments and it is lacking any real appeal other than the idea of having a super hero character. If the environments were more ""Grand Theft Auto"" this game would have hit a home run. If it was free online play it might be a good way to waste a couple of hours but @ $15 a month, it's not worth it."
2,wheels,"My problem with this book is that the wheels that go with it had been forcibly broken off and stuck in the envelope with the book. There's no way they can be put back together and fitted onto the bottom of the book, the way they're supposed to be. (See photo of book.) At least, I can't figure out any way to do it. Possibly, the company that sold me the book could send me some instructions. Otherwise, the book is of very little use because my grandson won't want it without the wheels."
1,Superseded by Recently Revised Version,"Why pay $163 on an old outdated document when you can join PMI and have access to the entire PMI standards library? There may be some useful information in this document worth preserving making the old versions worth $10, but unless you are a collector (and even then at $163 the price is questionable) you would be far better off spending the money on the PMI membership."
2,So many eye hooks!,"There were so many eye hooks on this it's almost impossible to put on. The garters don't reach the thigh highs if you are a plus size girl like me. The belt is very plasticy feeling. This is a fashion corset, meaning there are no steelbone spirals in the corset so it can bulge out if you aren't the same figure as the model. It's a nice corset if you're thinner but I wouldn't reccomend it for a bigger girl. I've worn it only two times since I've bought it several years ago."
3,Don't waste your money,This is an absolute nightmare to clean and you MUST use an oven mitt or you will get seriously burned. It is nothing more than a huge crockpot and is not worth the trouble or money.
5,Works like a charm!,"I take one of these each night before bed and it works great for me!Recently, I found out that I can't have gluten and this was a top priority for me when searching for a natural product I could use.I used to have night sweats which constantly woke me up throughout the night, and daytime sweats sometimes too, but this really helped me with that. Headaches may have been part of my issue and may have been resolved with this product - however I'm not sure because I got new glasses about the same time.Tried another brand because it was cheaper and it didn't work.The company which sold it through Amazon was very quick in sending it out too.Hope it works as well for you!"
4,Another T-Nutty Banger,"T-Nutty is str8 fire comin outta sac town holdin it down for the west man. Just bought this cd and i'm not mad at it. His first Cd was a classic but this one is also real tight. I recommend this cd and especially ""Last of the flowheecanz"". T-Nutty is one of a kind very original sound. Gone head and cop this."
5,GOTTA BUY IT,"THIS IS THE SICKEST RAPPER TO COME OUT OF THE WEST BY FARR , NO ONE HAS LYRICS LIKE T-NUTTY , AND HES FROM MY HOMETOWN SACTOWN. U GOTTA HAVE THIS CD"
2,Nitty Gritty but not much!,"I am disappointed with this cookbook. I was looking for a basic cookbook to explain times and techniques to cook standard items in a Toaster Oven. What I call the ""Nitty Gritty"" of using a Toaster Oven. Obviously I am wrong, the book contains nothing basic, standard or instructional about using a toaster oven."
2,have a hot plate,"This slender paperback has a lot to offer in the food category, which is the main point. The recipes were more gourmet and ethnic than I expected, with a lot of new dishes. Even if you choose not to cook them in a tabletop/toastr oven, they're nice to have around for only 1-4 servings. As for the books toaster-friendly side, I'm not so sure. The authors give few special techniques or safety tips, a must for an appliance notorious for being a fire hazard. Also, most small toaster ovens are hell to clean, making it questionable whether you'd want to broil a lot of greasey things like hamburgers in them."
5,Toaster Oven Cookbook,This is a great cookbook. I have used several of the recipes already and can't wait to use more!! I highly recommend it.
1,The Toaster Oven Cookbook,I returned the book. As I have a toaster over/rotisserie the book was not what I needed.
4,Nissan Stainless Steal Insulated Mug,This is a great 14oz. Coffee Mug. With the Lid on it will keep coffee hot for several hours and warm for many more. You will love it.
4,Great Travel Coffee Mug,This is a great travel coffee mug. It stays piping hot for hours. The lid vent could use a little work- but over all - its worth the price. Fits most any cup holder & very pleased with our purchase.
1,Not worth it!,"My husband got me this mug for a gift a couple of years ago. First, he had to drill a small hole in the cover because the lid kept popping off. That seemed to solve the problem for a while. Then, one day I noticed that one of the areas where the handle was attached to the mug gave way and the next thing you know, the coffee was in my lap! The whole handle fell off! Now, I use it without the handle, but the lid has started popping up again. maybe it's time for another hole or another mug! Oh, it does keep coffee hot for quite a while-that is the best thing I can say about it."
3,"Top Heavy, topples over easily","I like that it is slim enough to fit in a regular cup holder and the handle is nice and comfortable, but it makes the cup topple over easily."
4,Stays Hot Long!,"This mug works great. It keeps coffee HOT for several hours, and will keep ice for 5 hours or more. I do not like the way the lid attaches. I haven't had any problems with it, it just feels like it doesn't seal. This mug is not leak proof but it keeps your drinks hot or cold for a long time. Overall its very good."
2,A bit disappointed,"This book is beautifully photographed and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. However, I would have preferred a more contemporaty selection of designs. Most of the patterns have a dated, 60's, 70's look to them."
3,Uninspired,I was looking for afghans that were a little different. The designs in this book were uninspiring - I have much better books. None the less I will probably make at least one afghan out of it.
2,2 years and dying,"I enjoy the appearence of this watch. I have had it for two years and it began running slow. Believing it was a battery issue, I took it to my regular jeweler for a new battery. Upon checking the battery that was in the watch the jeweler informed me the battery was still strong. He cleaned the interior of the watch and returned it to me at no charge. A few weeks have gone by and it is still running slow. It will cost too much to repair it. Therefore, I will either get a new one or move on to another brand with similar looks."
2,"First Pat Boone changes metal to lounge, now this!!!!","This Britney Spears tribute CD isn't too bad, but is still the worst CD since Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood."" The singer on this album sings like Dennis DeYoung singing like a woman. When I heard ""Dear Diary,"" I could have sworn it was Dennis DeYoung or some strong-voiced softie (balladeer). Their version of ""Satisfaction"" is okay, but nothing compared to the versions by Britney Spears and the Rolling Stones; Devo still holds the record for the worst version of the song. All in all, if you're into people killing other people's songs, this CD's for you. But for people like me who wonder what these cover bands have been smoking, don't bother; stick with the Britney versions. I mean, **NOBODY** can sing ""Dear Diary"" better than Britney Jean Spears."
2,"janis joplin ""not""","Are you all insane? How can you compare britney spears to janis joplin. The reviewer ""a music fan"" said that britney spears is much better than janis joplin. That is laughable, they are from two diffrent times, and styles of music. Janis joplin died at 27, that is right, but she was a strong woman, in a mans world. The time she was around, woman were not the thing in music. She made it possible, for woman to be taken serious in music. So dont compare Janis 2 britney, that is a joke. Britney never wrote a song, she has songwriters writing songs for her, she has only to go into a studio, and put he vocals over pre made songs. Remember that she had nothing to do with the music, or lyrics, of the songs. Janis wrote her songs, she had talent, britney doesnt. Britney is just another t & a shaker, without the looks, what are you stuck with? Just another singer."
1,IT'S A JOKE,"For anyone out there who doesn't get it--this album is a joke and not to be taken seriously!If it were for real Madonna would've been the one singing on this album because she can really belt out the tunes and she's Brit's biggest fan.My advice is that if you like Britney then forget this ""album""!!!If you don't like Britney then you'll probably enjoy using the album to make fun of her.Either way it's a waste of money and time.I gave it 1 out of 5 stars because there was no choice for 0 out of 5 stars--whichn is what it really deserves!!!!!"
1,This Is Awful!,"This makes Britney sound bad. I thought that she would have friends of hers singing. This stuff sound terrible. This woman might sound good on somebody else, but DEFINITELY NOT Britney!"
1,WHO GAVE THE OKAY TO MAKE THIS REALLY BAD ALBUM????,"Who could possibly put this cd out internationally and not realize how HORRIBLE it is. Who wants a whole bunch of Britney Spears songs sung by other people who sound like CRAP!!! I am a very big Britney Spears fan, and saw this cd at a store...I didn't buy it cause I knew it wasn't going to be her voice...but right now, I listened to some samples of the cd that made my head hurt bad!!! It is almost like a joke for someone to put this out...I put 1 star, but believe me, it deserves NO STARS AT ALL!!!"
2,Who are these people?,"I can think of about 20 great bands right off the top of my mind who deserve tribute albums and haven't gotten them yet, but I'm not going to whine about that in my review. Its true, but too redundant.There are quite a few things about this album I don't understand. First of all, who are these people? Who's singing the songs? Can anyone clue me in on that?Second, tribute albums are usually comprised of greatest hits. Yet I haven't even heard of half of these songs. Why? Mainly because she's only had, what, 7 or 8 singles now? How does that merit a tribute album?Any ""true"" Spears fans wouldn't DARE using a Barbie doll to symbolize her--she's so ""above"" that, come on. Is this album for real?My guess is that, if anyone here actually bought or listened to this album--....The only reason I won't give it 1 star is because, at least someone else is singing the songs. Who could sound worse than her?"
1,Oops! I did it again!,"That's right, I bashed another tribute album for its mere existence. Since when do no talent LOSERS like Britney, NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys get tribute albums? Come on! Where's the tribute albums for artists like Sublime, the Ramones, the Beastie Boys, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Beck? These artists deserve tributes. I could think of a zillion artists who should get tribute albums. I can also think of at least a dozen female singers who are a million times better than Britney (Dido, Tori Amos...) . If you want a tribute album, check out tributes to some great bands, like KMFDM, Black Sabbath, NIN, and please, stop buying this crap, and leave Britney on the shelf."
1,"Biased, non-academic and simplified","I must confess that the strength of this book is its organization. For education purposes may seem great - simple and comprehensive. However, as for the contents, it is very disappointing (example 1: the author is using we - Americans, and them - Soviets, East Europeans; example 2: the author exaggerates many issues - like pollution of the CEE and gives no factual data; example 3: he generally uses media, tabloid-style language).This book is not a good source of knowledge for anyone. It is not appropriate for the beginners (BA level American students) because it gives a completely distorted and simplified picture of the CEE region. The person who knows nothing about the region may take this description as the reality, which is not correct."
2,Read with caution,"While this book provides a decent cursory review of East Europe, it is not to be taken as an authority on the subject. Many times, Roskin will oversimplify political agendas and use imprecise vocabulary to describe his subjects. For a comprehensive look at the political factors of the area, I would suggest something more along the lines of Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy."
1,Roskin...,"Of all the bad things I have read on Eastern Europe, this book is the worst. I already wrote a long criticism in reviewing another of Roskin's books, so I will not repeat it here, although he deserves all the criticism he can get. If ""chitatel""'s students liked Roskin's book, it only goes to show how harmful the book is: uninitiated students, without other access to information on the region, read Roskin as if he were telling the truth."
5,Excelente libro. Indispensable.,"Ideal para los amantes de las Ordenes de Caballería, y los honores. como Caballero y miembro de la Nobleza, no dudod en recomendarlo"
3,About what I expected.,"If you have read about the ""mod"" be careful. The first one I got the volume knob was broken right out of the box. The second one, the mod worked great, but be super careful taking the cover off. It is glued on by the power wires and the volume knob requires a little finesse to get out of the cover without breaking it. Once everything was cranked up to full blast it covers a decent area.The sound quality is ok, its not bluetooth, its FM, its is about what I expected, slight static, but pretty clear, good enough to listen to by the fire."
3,Crane Digital FM transmitter,The sound quality was pretty good and setting it was easy. I could not go far at all with my portable radio though. I couldn't get more than 3 feet away without hearing another channel. This is mostly because of the limitation the FCC put on personal radio transmitters. This might be perfect for car trips though as a way of plugging in some other media into a car that only has a radio. I would really like a higher wattage output but I blame that on the FCC. One other thing I would have liked would be a way to hook up a higher wattage antenna. Maybe an easy way to hack it to use a stronger transmitter. Crane did good but lacking any power due to FCC regulations this product is worthless here in Albuquerque other than for a radio really close to it. I tried each channel and it was clear across 80% of the channels at 3 ft but as I moved away it would go to hell.
1,Very disappointed,"I was very excited about getting this device. I thought I would be able to listen to internet radio all over the house.When I got it and set it up, I could only go about 3-4 feet before I got interference on my radio. I tried the suggested modification from other posters but this made no difference. Crane seem to have changed the VR2 dial since earlier posters and it is not obvious how to turn it fully, it just keeps turning forever. So no luck there.Couple of mitigating factors: 1) the input level on the side seem to be faulty on my unit, I got better results when I pushed it at an angle but obviously I could not keep my finger on it all of the time and 2) where I live, the FM spectrum seems to be very full and there are not many clear frequencies and as soon as I got more than a few feet away I got other radio channels.So, I sent this back, it's no more than a piece of frustrating junk to me."
2,Poor range,"I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard. It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box. I performed the power boosting ""fix"" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal. This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations. If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly.I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car. It's physically well built and works fine for that. I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere."
4,Works for me,"After using various other FM transmitters, including the iRock and the USB-powered Motokata Transplayer, I decided to shell out for the more expensive C. Crane FMT. This unit works fine, serving a radio 100' away. The sound quality is OK.I had no need for the range extension modification described in other reviews. The legal requirement to keep the range short apparently makes this a difficult product to get right. Whatever its own merit or lack thereof might be, it works better than its competitors. I will eventually buy more C. Crane stuff."
1,Baby Monitors go farther!,"Don't waste your money! I have been a FM hobby broadcaster (neighborhood broadcasting) for years. I'll take a Ramsey FM 100 B any day. Even after trying all modifications available on the internet, extending the anntena with a new piece of antenna attached, and various other ""tricks"" I found only a minor increase in range even after putting it on the second floor. The volume, even after adjusting the volume knob, is not nearly loud enough (or even close to other FM station) on our stereo, clock radios, or even the car radio in the garage.Our FCC certified baby monitors go 5 times farther with a louder signal.I don't think asking for 100 feet of coverage to cover a regular city home & lot is asking too much! But with this C Crane transmitter, it is!"
2,Increase the range with out opening the box.,Pry off the CCRANE label on the bottom and you will see two small holes and one large hole. The large hole gives access to the VR2 which if turned clockwise to the stop will extend the range. You don't have to open the box! Also using a flat screwdriver rather than a Philips may be better to prevent stripping out the plastic.
2,If you dont know What your missing then buy this wanna be !,"Everything Everyone is saying is true. this unit works after you do a bunch of crap to it. However, i own both a FailSafe .5w fm transmitter and this ccrane. LISTEN TO ME... pony up the xtra money and get the failsafe .5w. now, with that said. I use the failsafe in a machine shop and it cover excellent but more importand its pristine clarity rite out of the box with no rediculous modifications. i wish i didnt void my warranty on the Ccrane by getting cheap and listening to these reviews. then i could return it and buy the failsafe for my home instead of the Ccrane. this thing is plastic and feels like a toy. BUY SOME REAL GEAR!! but like my title says "" if you don't know what your missing , then buy this unit"" its your loss. i except mine but it wont happen againoverall - 2 stars."
4,Does the job,I bought this item so I could listen to my XM radio throughout the house on other radios. It does the job. The one I received has good range without having to adjust anything inside it. You probably will have to adjust the volume so the signal will be clear on the other radios.
2,poor,"Right out of the box the ac adapter did not work. I resorted to batteries, did the suggested adjustment to the unit (turned the pot 100% clockwise) found an empty freq on my radio and tuned the transmitter to same. Reciever is 20+/- from transmitter through an open door, lots of background hiss, right channel barely there at all. Tried different freq same result. moved antenna on both units with little change. For the money this is not a satisfactory product. I am going back to the wireless speakers that this unit was intended to replace, they work fine with far greater range and little if any hiss. This product is being returned."
1,No Right Channel,"I have the exact same problem as the other reviewer who tagged this item as ""poor"" - and with so many good reviews I wonder if there is a problem with this manufacturing run. Lots of hiss on all FM frequencies, right channel is not there, and the input pot can't seem to adjust a standard line-in signal level to prevent distortion. Too bad because I had high hopes for this product, but now it's got to be returned."
5,This product works as expected after user mod.,"In order to generate a useful FM signal, peel back the decal on the back to expose the hole in the upper center. Insert a small screwdriver through the hole into the white screwhead and rotate slightly Clockwise until you feel resistance.The FCC restriction is not adequate for home use and seems to be an attempt to damage the satellite radio business. Shame on Sirius and other satellite radio suppliers for not being as clever as CCrane and delivering products in FCC compliance but with the capability for a simple user modification to make the product useful."
4,placement experimentation of FM xmtr pays off,"In my house, I found the FM transmitter radiates vertically between floors much better than across the same floor. [Yet laying the unit on its side doesn't improve same floor reception!]"
5,Best Transmitter I have found,This is the Best Transmitter around. Have had serveral different types. This is my Favorate
1,Expectation not met,"I bought this product thinking it will allow me to transfer the internet streaming radio to my FM Stereo. Although the set up was easy, the quality of sound was extremely poor and the reception on FM stereo very noisy. My computer is only 5 feet away from my stereo!I tried different frequencies to no avail. I had to return the product and I got prompt refund. I do not understand why the companies cannot come up with a good quality product. May be, the FCC does not allow for high powered frequencies for private transmission."
1,CCraine FM Transmitter-a poor product,"I bought this transmitter expecting to send radio programs from my home computer to my bedside radio, a distance of 20 feet. This transmitter unfortunately has such low gain that you would need to hold the radio within 2 feet of it to hear anything. I returned the original one I received to Amazon and they were prompt in sending me a second one which unfortunately was no better than the first. I called CCrain about the problem and they were of no help. I even emailed them about it and they never replied. I finally ended up getting the Whole House FM Transmitter which works great."
3,Better option,"I bought this item to use with my new Sirius radio that I bought to replace an older model that broke. (The new Sirius radios have the power of the built in transmitter reduced to a level that renders it useless) I had similar range problems with the Crane unit as many of the reviewers here had. I did not want to make the modification in case I wanted to return it in favor of another product. I purchased the Whole House Transmitter and I found it to be an excellent solution. I totally recommend it over the C Crane unit and I returned the Crane. As for the concerns some people have that the Whole House only transmits on a limited number of frequencies, I found that the signal is so strong that it is not an issue in getting a clean transmission."
3,Many variables to get this to work,I made the changes recommended in a previous post and while this did increase the reception it did not provide the distance I expected. I can easily tune-in from the first floor of my house but not all the rooms on the second floor (~1500 sq foot house). The source volume of the device is also something to take into consideration as it was very difficult to find the correct setup for this to work.
3,Got a dud,"It appears to me that this product is hit or miss with the transmit power. For me, it was a miss. I could get it to work somewhat to perhaps 6 feet, but even that was quite weak. I had to crank up my radio to max volume to get a useable signal. I tried some suggestions found here and elsewhere, but nothing worked. Called the company and they tried to help, but really could offer no additional suggestions. I gave it 3 stars since it seems that I got a dud and Amazon was great with the return - full refund."
3,OK within 10 Feet,"This product works OK if you are within 10 feet of it. Any more then that and you get static. Good enough for my use, but could be better."
5,Wayyyy above my expectations :),"Boy was I surprised when I tuned in and heard my broadcast on the radio. Reception was very good in every room, the farthest being about 40 feet away from the transmitter (device not hacked). I have to say that I live in an old house though; perhaps the signal has an easier time travelling through whatever it is the walls are made of.I ordered the device through the C.Crane web site on a Friday and it was delivered in Canada the following Wednesday (I selected the second cheapest delivery method). Note: duty fees were an additionnal 20$CDN.I am therefore a *very* happy customer and would gladly order again from these people.Jean-Philippe Valois"
1,terrible reception a few feet away,"I was seeking a way to watch t.v. in my basement while running on the treadmill and lifting weights in the early morning hours. The T.V. had to be turned up way too loud so that I could hear it while on the treadmill. I purchased this FM transmitter and used my arm-band fm ""walkman"" type of device to receive the signal. The reception was terrible unless I stood right next to the transmitter. If I walked even SIX FEET away from the transmitter, the signal was lost completely. I tried all kinds of different frequencies and even tried putting the transmitter across the room from my other stereo equipment.I did NOT try the hardware modification that one of the other reviews mentions.I returned the Crane FM transmitter and went bluetooth: I bought the Motorola S9 and the Motorola DC800 stereo adapter. These two paired easily and the sound is unbelievable. I can run on the treadmill and watch ""loud"" T.V. and there are no reception problems."
3,"Worked, but wasn't great","I bought this transmitter with the intention of opening it up and ""hacking"" it to increase the range. But even after doing so, the range wasn't quite what I was looking for. I wanted to broadcast to my backyard from the middle of my two-story house. It came close, but there was always some static. Indoors, it worked fine indoors.I switched to the ""Whole House Transmitter"", which had a better range for me, no ""hacking"" required.So if you're not looking to penetrate to the outdoors, this will do the job. Otherwise, I recommend the Whole House Transmitter."
1,major disappointment,"It works, just barely, if your source and target are two feet apart.The sound sucks even then. A lot of money wasted. I am very ticked off.Wish I had never ordered it. Don't make same mistake."
2,Nothing but disappointing...,"I tried this with my stereo and various radios. It worked marginally at best, but most of the time it didn't work at all. My stereo is digital, most of my radios are dial: didn't matter. I couldn't get it to perform consistantly at all. When it did work it had to be within a few feet of the receiver, but sound was still full of static and easily interupted. I had more luck with the Tunecast, which isn't saying much. I tried all the ideas and suggestions to improve performance with negligible improvement. I'm returning this piece of junk today, I feel like a sucker for buying it."
1,Total Junk !!!!!,"Would not even transmit a full 2 feet. Could barely hear anything. of all the FM transmitters I have tried, including $4 cheap ones, this was the worst. Returned right back to amazon. Total junk."
2,Didn't work out of box,"If not for (NC ""NC"")'s review this product would have been WORTHLESS. The signal strength out of box was about ZERO. I put the product next to a powered FM antenna and got ZERO reception on all frequencies. After following NC""NC""'s instructions the product worked better then I had anticipated. I get a clear FM signal outside of my home which is exactly what I was looking for. That being said I cannot give this product five stars and if it where not for Amazons feedback I would have returned it. For 70$ the product should have worked out of box."
2,Not up to my expectations,"While this product probably works well in very close ranges, my hope was that it could transmit radio signals directly across a 15-ft span. Even after I upped its signal power (a la dubious website instructions), my signal did not improve substantially. I returned the product because it was essentially useless for my purposes."
1,Worked for two months only!,Got the c.crane in mid September.Worked fine for two months after I (as most others here) turned VR2 poti clockwise to fix the range problem.Now I can't switch it on anymore. I get only a blinking crossed over battery-symbol.I have made sure that I have 5 volt in to the socket. Also tried with AA batteries.Opened it to see if any connection was loose but found nothing wrong.And no warranty since I opened it to fix the range problem.So away to the trashcan.
1,It really did not work,The concept is a great concept and I bought it for my husband to use outside with his Bose speakers. Unfortunately the sound quality emmitted was not good. It also cut in and out. We returned the item.
2,too bad signal is so weak,"I've owned my transmitter for several years now. Were it not for the range problem (and yes I did try the ""range fix"" that another reviewer posted), I'd be very happy with my unit. I like the frequency selection, overall sound quality (when it does work), and the ability to control the input level. But the weakness of the transmitted signal really hurts this unit. Unless my transmitter is just a few feet away from the receiver, it is worthless. My brother owns the same model (only his is white while mine is black). His unit definitely has a stronger transmitted signal as he can transmit a good clean signal throughout much of his home. So perhaps my unit was from a bad batch."
1,Un Satis factory,"This unit wouldn't Tx 6 (line of site)feet and any satisfactory volume level. And, That was after making the recommended adjustment to increase range. This product is a Totally UNSATISFACTORY product."
1,Really?,Simply did not work. Nothing but faint music under loud static no matter what I hooked it to. Thanks Amazon for standing behind your customers and providing for an easy return.
1,It didn't work for me.,"I wish I could return it but I broke the warranty by using the hack described elsewhere. I imagined listening to my computer on a dedicated FM station throughout the house. The best I ever got was terrible reception in the kitchen. It may work in other parts of the country or other parts of the world, but it did not work for me in West Palm Beach."
2,Didn't work for me - but great customer service,"I ordered this item and couldn't get it to work. I tried hooking it up to my computer and receiving the signal one room away. I just got static. I then tried using my mp3 player for the source signal, but still static. I then brought a radio into the same room as the transmitter, but still just got static. I returned the product. I must say the return was simple and I even got an apology letter from C. Crane Company stating, ""I am very sorry the merchandise didn't work out for you."" They even included a one dollar bill for my ""time and patience"". One dollar might not seem like much, but how many other companies even bother to send an apology letter?"
1,Terrible signal strength,"Out of the box, the signal from this device only reaches about 5 feet. There is also a persistent hissing noise. I have tried the resistor hack described in other comments, which does extend the range to about 15 feet, but adds an annoying whine."
2,Just OK,"Recently our classical radio station changed format so needed something to get our old station. Got an internet radio but needed an FM transmitter to send signal out to our radios in the house. First bought a Hilly .5 watt FM transmitter which worked good. But because I am sensitive to EMF radiation, I returned it and bought this Crane low power transmitter. The Hilly transmitters are much better quality and power so if that does not bother you, go with the Hilly transmitters.First I opened it to increase the very low power. Tricky to do and ended cracking the volume dial. Be careful. Got more power but difficult to set up as got a 60 hz hum which I can not remove. Limited distance of 20-25 ft thru walls. Reception in our radios is barely acceptable but I have to live with it until the classical station we listen to increases their power for us to pick up their FM signal."
2,"""Disappointed""","Purchased it for 2 day delivery because I needed it on Monday the 25th.Set it up,and it would only broadcast about 2 ft. Re-checked everything,supply voltage,settings,etc. No dice.Then because I was up against a deadline,I made the dumb move of makingthe range mods suggested online.(thus voiding my warranty)Range improved to a very spotty 5 ft.Searched the web everyone suggested the same mods but claimed much betterresults.Oh well live and learn!!!"
5,Totally up-graded my quality of life,"This has got to be the best thing I ever bought. I work at home in an attached shop. The computer is in an office in the house. the reception is crystal clear, and I can listen in my cars and still pick it up 4 or 5 houses away. Its amazing. Using it with itunes, Pandora, or podcasts gives me the best of all worlds, and I can tune all my stereos to it and have the same broadcast all over the property. C Crane provides a site that will give you the perfect frequency. Works like a charm. The first one they sent did not work, and C Crane was GREAT about helping me on the phone to troubleshoot, and then they sent me another which has been working perfectly for 6 months or more. Get one!"
1,Junk,"Bought this to replace a $10 battery operated transmitter I bought 8 years ago. The older transmitter works well to about 25 feet. I just wanted to be able to use an AC adapter instead. Followed the included instructions. Range was about six inches. Volume wheel seemed to be rubbing against the edge of the casing. When I touched the wheel, I got horrible static. Oh well, back to the factory and back to using batteries."
2,C. Crane FMT FM transmitter review/results,"To my purchase of the C.Crane FMT- FM transmitter I would NOT recommend this product. By no fault of the manufacture, (due to the heavy restrictions by government rules namely the FCC) the little FM transmitter has very, very little range of transmitting its signal.Here are some of the results found.Distance was at best 20 to 25 feet (even after finding the little power adjustment underneath the back label and carefully turning to full clockwise position) also added a 12 inch piece of wire to the end of the built in antenna, and that made a very slight improvement.The transmit audio, when adding an MP3 player to the FMT was fair to good, but, if your FM receive radio was not getting anything but a strong signal, the audio was poor.The concept and idea about the little FMT is a good one, but, sadly it is a looser. Save your time and money, and look for something better.Hope this helps.Mike M."
4,Best I have found in this category.,"Good overall. I, however, would have liked a little more distance without rigging up my own longer antenna. do yourself a favor and turn the potentiometer up to max by peeling the sticker off the back and using small philips head screwdriver through hole and turning all the way clockwise gently and buying a full 6 volt wall wart. Also, when using don't place too close to audio source or you will get some feedback noise."
2,Continuous background noise,"I read lots of review before I ordered this product. I thought it was the best FM transmitter. I want to use it to replace my broken Bluetooth earphone. After I got it, I connected it to my laptop and tried stereo test video (Left-Right) on youtube. It is truly a stereo FM transmitter. But instantly I noticed continuous background noise from the transmitter. I turned ""stereo"" to ""mono"" on my FM radio and the noise is reduced. But I don't think it is worth to use it on mono only. I feel sorry that I have to return it. It is my first return on Amazon. I hope Amazon will give me a full refund. Just a remind: never go back to FM transmitter after you used Bluetooth.// Amazon does give me a full refund. Thanks."
3,DOA,"The C.Crane FM Transmitter I received powered on and buttons worked but it did not transmit a usable signal. Read directions thoroughly, called customer care and found no solution. Tried multiple FM receivers and got minimal reception from 2 feet away. Adjusted input volume per instructions. Unfortunately I just couldn't get it to work. Returned for refund."
3,Functional but still disappointing...,"I purchased this FM transmitter with the hopes that it would do what it claimed to do on it's website. After connecting it, the FM transmitter only worked as far as 20 feet - with distortion in certain areas within the 20 feet. Luckily the purpose of my purchse was for this to work within 20 or so feet, so I decided to keep it. If it were to work any less then I would have returned it. Please keep in mind if you are to purchase this product, that it's only designed (according to my application) to work within 20 +/- feet. If that's your idea then it will be a good buy, if not - stay away!"
1,Totally unsatisfactory,"I am returning this product because it is totally unsatisfactory. There is a great deal of static and the range is extremely short. Volume begins to fade at about 10' and is greatly diminished and garbled at about 20' even though the description states that you can listen to an audio device located in a different room. The instructions state that it will operate at 30' to 75' which is totally false. I tried positioning the unit differently, extending the antenna and different frequencies and nothing worked. At any distance regardless how short the static makes the listening experience unacceptable."
2,Limited use,"I found that this transmitter did not work half-way across my house. It worked well from my cable box to the stereo receiver right next to it, but I can just use a standard RCA cable to cover that distance. I was also surprised that I was instructed to call the manufacturer to get instructions on how to modify the transmitter to work at greater distances. Why would they not ship the item that way in the first place? This may work for some people, but it definitely did not work for me."
1,C. Ctrane FMT Digital transmitter a disappointment,"This product did not work for me in the way I expected from the online info available.Even when the C. Ctrane FMT Digital transmitter was next to my Yamaha stereo tuner and though I tried many broadcast frequencies from the bottom to the top of the FM range, only a crackling signal came through.And I did try moving the Crane unit around and adjusting the angle of the antenna. A high quality JVC micro system, 24 feet away through an open door picked up nothing. Ditto for a new, very sensitive, Yamaha stereo receiver located 12-15 feet away through a wall."
2,VR2 gain adjustment,"This adjustment merely increases the s/n ratio from ""atrocious"" to ""unacceptable"". Anyone wanting to play the signal at more than stage-whisper volume will be disappointed."
5,excellent purchase,"The seller sold this transmitter as ""used-like new"".When I received it, I was surprised to find that it was just like the description, like new. It was packed in the factory box and still works like new. I haven't had the slightest problem with this purchase."
2,Bad advice,"Though this book has some good advice and it written in a fun style, I'm giving it two stars because I'm very disappointed in some of the unethical and illegal advice that it recommends:* Lie to the cop if you've been drinking* Sneak to better seats during a theater intermission* Buy tickets online so you can get the child's price* Buy clothes, wear once, and return themI'd prefer to learn to be a hip chick without scamming, cheating, or lying."
4,Never leave home without it,"Remember, that girls can do anything a guy can do. If it is the first date, it will now be easier to make your own decisions instead of having someone else do it for you. A guide line for all women, leaving home without it, may be your worst mistake. ;-)"
5,AWESOME!,Great book!! You'd be crazy not to buy it; I really learned a lot from Anna's tips and suggestions!
1,Good Concept,I still have not received my product. They first sent me the wrong product then after sending it back to them they said that the correct order needing to be reordered and no real date has been given as to when I would receive my order. It has been about a month since I placed the order......
1,Total Scam,"I purchased this product at a local market. I had hoped that this would give me some protection, and stay away from certain chemicals that are harmful to the body. I work in retail unloading trucks and in customer service. This product failed in ALL of its claims immediately. I was extremely embarrassed. I know that this product caused multiple awkward situations between me and my co-workers. I also believe that this product harmed sales in my store that day.When I contacted the company about their abysmal failure via their website, I have received no response. That was over a month ago. They haven't said a single thing over a whole month! I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you do not buy this product. As far as I am concerned, this is purely a scam product. You'll pay money for something that can't even begin to hold up to its name."
2,"Pass on the ""Sticky""","After reading the reviews I purchased this today and couldn't wait to put it on. Unfortunately it went on gummy and sticky. My arm pits felt like I had some type of glue/paste underneath. Did not settle well on the skin so after an hour I had to wash it off. I purchased the unscented for men for my husband who takes blood pressure medication. I noticed there is ""grapefruit"" in the ingredients. Unfortunately with some medications ""grapefruit"" can cause a slower release and is not recommended so he won't be able to use this product either."
3,Not bad but not perfect.,"The fragrance of this deodorant is very mild, and it is a fresh, earthy scent (I used the Aloe Vera version).It goes on smoothly, and is initially a bit damp under the arms, though not quite as wet and sticky as gel deodorants are. It is kind of a cross between solid and gel.I am a housewife and do a lot of cooking, heavy cleaning, and chasing of kids and a huge, crazy dog, and this deodorant has worked pretty well for me overall. It survived a trip to the zoo in hot, humid weather, so it seems to work well for the average sweaty human.Just to be clear, this deodorant will not keep you from perspiring(it is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant) but it does seem to work well at combating stink. That said, you will definitely want to reapply it if you've been really active (exercise, etc.) or you're having a really stressful day in order to avoid smelling like you put an onion in a headlock!"
2,Probably makes my BO even worse,"So I've been trying the Jason deodorant with aloe in it for a little while and it just plain does not work. I guess my underarms are moisturized, but I could just use regular lotion if that's all I wanted. The ""deodorant"" properties of the product don't work for me at all, and I may actually smell worse than if I had used nothing at all! I'm glad others have had better luck. Maybe it is all about body chemistry."
3,"Okay, but not great!","I have almost all the Best of Brochure design books and I found this one the most uninspiring. The others were great, but this was just...okay. Add to that, the size of this book makes it so I can't comfortably line it up with other large books I have. This goes in the over sized books, like the map books."
4,A Good Reference,"Just chock-full of photographed samples of brochures. There are many styles represented, including photographic, illustrative, and typographic. The brochures are for the most part very colorful and creative. It's always nice to have samples to flip through when you're looking for inspiration or a possibile direction to go in with a design you're working on. This book is also useful for showing to your clients, to help get a feel what type of brochure they might be looking for or what styles they are drawn to. I enjoy having this book in my collection."
4,A great way to learn FrontPage,I tend to love IDG books and this one is no exception. It is easy to understand (important for computer literature) and well laid out. It teaches the basics of using front page as well as some of the more difficult (and advanced) features such as beginning forms! Since I tend to learn more by jumping on in and getting my hands dirty this book was perfect for me.
1,POOR MOVIE,THE SEANERY IS POOR AND THE ACTING WAS B LEAVEL THE STORY STUNK LIKE A DAY OLD BAGEL I WOULD NOT RECOMND IT
5,GREAT SINGER BOOK!,Singer is a American success story! This would be great reading and very informative. I would love a copy of this book!
3,Well researched,"Worth the effort. Packed with data and presented in a palatable fashion but there is something awkward there. Like English isn't the author's first language or the book didn't get edited.. Has a number of awkward grammatical constructions and here and there, a sentence that doesn't have all its parts. I'd suspect it was Bissell's first book but , like I said, worth effort. I'd read another of his books.."
3,History of the Singer Company,"The First Conglomerate is a must-read for a student of business management, as it gives details of the rise and near fall of the Singer Company, and what it might have become with a little more foresight in the late twentieth century. I read it, however, not so much for the history of the company, but in hopes of reading descriptions of the evolution of their main product, the Singer sewing machine. Information on the actual product, and other products, however, is scarce, and can be more easily obtained by visiting sewing machine enthusiast websites.I was also disappointed with the poor quality of the e-book itself, which contains far too many typos--indicating that it was OCR scanned and not proof read diligently (spell-checkers don't count as actual proofing!) That being said, I spent a lot of time reading, even into the late hours of the night, and was very fascinated with how this company progressed over the past century and a half."
5,Nice movie,"If you're a fan of Naveen Andrews from ""LOST"", you'll love this movie. Low budget film, but interesting story. Naveen looked pretty good in his youth."
3,Drowning on Dry land,"This is a road movie with a twist. Instead of two buddies we have a woman running away from her life and the cabbie she hires to take her to the desert.There is a natural antagonism between the two that soon becomes romantic tension, as the two talk.Hannah(Barbara Hershey) is clearly a wounded soul questioning why she has put up with abusive situations for so long. Her driver Darshan,(Naveen Andrews) is also hurt,a professor,Anglo-Indian, fleeing his failed marriage in England, now driving a cab in New York.The comedy is subtle, sometimes too subtle and there is some drag to the pacing. The romance between the two is believable and appealing.Fortunately the script is spared any clutter, there are other characters but the focus stays squarely on these two, giving the audience a chance to know them and believe that two opposites aren't so opposite after all.This movie is affordably priced making it a good addition to a collection and also experimental viewing."
1,"Oh, dear...what were they thinking?","Who greenlighted this dreadul spin on THELMA & LOUISE meets ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE!?? The wasted talents of Barbara Hershey and Carol Lynley are only the top of the list of problems with this one... Poor direction, sloppy Script Supervision and overall pointlessness make this entirely forgettable. .. Bizarre!"
5,Drowning On Dry Land,"I already have this on VHS, but wanted it on DVD because I nolonger have a VHS player."
1,Oakenfold is not worth the bucks,"Oakenfold is losing his brillance and his touch. His work seems rushed. It sounds unlike anything you would expect from the great oakenfold! I think he feels he has his footing securely in the music world and he is going to remain on the top heap! Instead, he shows me that he has long since needed to retire. This is crap. I couldn't get thru the cd without falling asleep in my chair. SAVE your money!"
1,dreadful,Just because you *can* remix something doesn't mean you necessarily *should*. This album is abysmal.
1,Enough is enough,"I,ve been following Paul's downfall for some time now but hoped he would make a U turn and go back to what he USED to do best. This is ridiculous, he is going nowhere like this. Pity!"
1,remember when...,"Oakenfold was good. If you do, then skip this one. My impressions of this cd are that Mr. Oakenfold is chasing after the cheese that made everyone love Fat Boy Slim for a few minutes. Problem is, we've moved on, and so should Oakey. There's not depth here folks. What there is a lot of though, is guitars, and not in a good way. Check out his other recent mix albums instead, where he actually mixes."
1,Tough on the ears,"Love Oakenfold, but this album is plain silly. Don't ask me what happened here, but I'd avoid this one at all cost. Sorry Paul!"
1,Exploiting his name to remain alive,"What a shame. Although I believe that nothing remains the same, I do expect that things change for the better. However, this is not the case here with Mr. Oakenfold, who had succumbed to the dark side of quick buck, mainstream commercialism with this ugly release that has great underground DJs like the late Tony De Vit & Larry Levan turn in their graves, and securing Mr. Oakenfold as the Darth Vedar of electronica.Don't waste your money, or time."
1,Just as I expected,"This CD is the latest from a ""falling star"" DJ that proves he is truly over the hill. There has been so much progression with the dance music scene over the past few years and Oakenfold has remained stagnant. I refused to buy this particular cd...but when a DJ starts mixing Madonna, The Doors and Justin Timerlake...you know his time is over."
5,An enjoyable read!,"Don't get this book for instruction. If you want to read some fun and amazing stories in chess (with some instructive parts) you will find ""Chess for Fun and Chess for Blood"" to be very entertaining! I read this book long ago and recommend it for anyone age 12 or older."
4,I'm obsesses with the song Se Ela Dana Eu Dano,I discover by chance the tune on youtube.When I find out the author I bought the CD from Amazon.I think this a great CD for dancing in fun summer time.Brazilian Funk Rock!!
3,interesting,"Many of the stories were very good and certainly different takes on the traditional Arthurian legend. There were a couple that I really liked, like ""The Dog's Story"" (I think that's what it was called..something about a Dog) but most of them were, although well-written, a little too far-out for me."
4,"Funny,Interesting way to introduce horse racing/breeding","I don't know much about horses,I live in a place where owning one means you have the space,money, and can accomodate them to the colder climate. Needless to say, I went into this book knowing very little about them let alone what it takes to make a champion racehorse.However, by the time I got done reading this book I was able to inform other people on horses in general and breeding them. I enjoyed reading it, Conley makes the whole business entertaining and practical for anyone to understand. I couldn't put the book down, everyday when I was finished with what had to be done life-wise I read this book. Despite this factor there are a few things in the book that one had to either know offhand or research. This is the only reason why it didn't get five stars from me."
3,Breaks Well and then Fades,"Firstly this book was written to be entertaining. It was not written by a man who works in the breeding industry and he is not trying to teach you how to start your own farm. This book is not going to impart the secret recipe to a champion. If I recall correctly I the author is a reporter of some sort.What the book might do is help you to pass a few hours. It's a light-hearted, easy-to-read book. I thought that the beginning was especially good, but as the book progressed it started to lose it's zing.I would recommend checking it out of the library for a fun read, but I would not buy this book myself."
5,Insight into the Horse breeding industry.,"Fascination book. I never imagined the life of a horse after the racetrack, especially the stallions. Really not so glamorous... especially for the mares. Recommend for all horse race fans to see what really does happen to the horses you love and follow during their careers."
3,A bit disappointed,"I used this book for my wedding. It's a nicely crafted book, but it's very small. The lined pages inside don't lend themselves to a lot of writing; I found that my guests just signed their names rather than writing special messages, which is what I was expecting."
5,Holy Inspired Music,"I think this album is a ""must have"" for all families. The Palumbos music is wholesome and yet entertaining and the message is not only enjoyable it reaches directly to ones soul. Yes Jesus Christ is alive! This is a perfect album to get especially during this Easter Season. My favorite song is ""Healer"". Thank you Amazon for making this music available for all to hear. God bless you!"
1,Invoice Not Received,"Please certify that the item is original from The L.S. Starrett Company USA.We are unable to receive Invoice for the same, Please send immedetaly or Urgently."
1,Way too expensive,One tube of toothpaste for 7.70??? Really??? Tom's of Maine will sell them in a 3 pack for less than $10.00 and they are also prime.
5,Very interesting. I had a good time reading it!,"The story is very exciting. The kids are people I would like to know. It had a very strong female character in it, and I liked that a LOT. I liked the war reinactment in the Dragon's Head. Very realistic!"
2,Little Will to Conquer this series,"William lived in a small town in Normandy. He is abused by his dad and bullied at school, so he seeks refuge in an old castle, it turns out someone lived there, and he doesn't want to be intruded upon. However he has a big change of heart and all the kids in town make up a fantasy kingdom there. Then all the parents find out and they have a major argument. Them two kids get Charles de Gaulle to fix it for them.It was a very boring book, very dull and hard to follow. No one was nice or sympathetic, and all the parents were paper-thin. Throughout the whole book there were these pointless plot twists and such that were just boring. Everything is cheesy and unless you like being bored I would not recommend it to you. The end left and wide space for a sequel, which I have no will to conquer."
5,Absolutely great punch set!!,"I bought this a couple years ago and I've been very pleased with the quality. The case fits well (wished they still did the wooden blocks like years ago) but quality is second to none. Cost a bit more, but the quality is worth it. Sizes are snug and steel hardness, superb. Great for gunsmithing applications. You definitely get what you pay for!!!!"
1,"Starrett is great, but Amazon is rippin' you off","Starrett has great products. Unfortunately they no longer make/ship this nice punch set in a cool hardwood container. Instead it is a cheap red plastic container. Go to the Starrett website and that's what you see. Amazon however is happy to sell you this set, showing you the nice wood container you WON'T get, and ships the plastic. Doesn't that constitute false advertising? Shame on you Amazon!! The wood container was half of the product!!"
2,Bad video transfer,The video transfer on this was bad. Scenes in broad daylight were so badly damaged you couldn't see them on the screen. There were no extras on the DVD. This is a classic example of a studio trying to pull in $$$ on a cheap re-issue.
1,A classic novel made dull and boring.Stay FAR away!,"If you have this debacle on vhs, keep it! The dvd is not worth anything better. It is the same print and the same misdirected, terribly acted mess. Amy Irving and Ben Cross could not have acted any flatter. The story plods hopelessly through all 300+ minutes. There is no relief for a thirst for a better film.Stick with A PASSAGE TO INDIA, HEAT AND DUST,GANDHI, WATER,FIRE and EARTH."
2,The Far Pavillion movie direction,I was quite bored throughout the movie. Amy Irving looks sickly and she has been made to look very ugly. The Kings and Princess' in those times in India enjoyed good clothes and good living. The dresses worn even by the royals are shown to be very cheap. The royal processions shown are shown to be worse than the poor tribals. The movie would be better to watch if it was directed by someone who understood Old Indian royal life. Overall a poor depiction of royal life in India.
5,Indian Raj Spectacular!,"It is as I remember it...absolutely marvelous! Such a tender love story woven amist Ash's military career draws one into every aspect of their lives. For those familiar with the locations, it is amusing to see how clever the filmakers were in using historic sites to make one whole location. Romeo and Juliet have nothing over Anjuli and Ashok's splendid!"
5,The Far Pavilions,"I love this movie. Until I found it on Amazon.com, I never thought I would find it on dvd but when I did, I had to buy it"
5,The Far Pavilions,"Was thrilled to find this now on DVD. It is a wonderful story, set in a beautiful country and the usual excellent service from Amazon"
2,Far Pavilions VHS movie,"I just loved the book and the series when shown on tv but the VHS I received was very dissappointing as the quality was terrible, there were times when the tracking went all haywire, the quality of the movie was dark and fuzzy...it seemed to me that it was not of the quality I am used to getting though Amazon, maybe this product would have been better if it was on 2 tapes. I didn't have a dvd player at the time I got this so now wish I had waited to see if it was available on dvd! It is a long wonderful story tho.- read the book!"
3,Far Pavilions,"The original Television Show, The Far Pavilions, was spectacular. It had everything for a true historical love story. Unfortunatly, this set has had too much cut from the original, there is a definate lack of understanding about Ash and Anjuli before Ash arrives back to India. Additional cuts to fit it into the four volume set detracted from the show. I will still look for the original show. These videos are lacking too much for the original viewer"
5,New Transfer and Sub-Titles,"I have enjoyed this mini-series ever since I first saw it while stationed at Thule Air Base, Greenland, in 1984. Sure, the video quality was poor but the romantic story and the locales of India made it watchable. This version is a little longer than the original DVD (probably because of the inclusion of the credits at the beginning and end of each episode). It also has sub-titles. The transfer is not perfect but it is better to watch than the previous DVD. If you can't get to India, this may be the next best way to go."
2,Underwhelming,"Despite its length , huge cast, lavish sets, gigantic processions, all showing Indian culture, it was too much for me to cope with on a TV screen. It really needs a cinerama or cinemascope sized screen, to show the film to its advantage.I think the story got lost some where in all of the above. Ben Cross didn`t appeal to me either as the hero. A good working actor but not really leading man material. Amy Irving, lovely to look at but colourless in her role.The sets, costumes and especially the wonderful accessories for the elephants, make for a colourful and eyecatching sight, but as I said, on a much bigger screen."
2,Review of Far Pavilions,The DVR is not working properly---it is pink 1/2 the time and it stops and starts all thru the 2nd disc and I will be returning itfor another which I hope will work correctly.
2,"COVER de ""THE SMITHS""","La canción ""Esta Luz Nunca Se Apagara"" es un mal ""cover"" de ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out"" de los SMITHS, la canción ""En Algun Lugar"" es del grupo Duncan Dhu, del cual formaba parte, Mikel me parece buen músico, pero la selección deja mucho que desear al incluir las canciones que menciono, parecieran de relleno ..."
5,My son really likes this game,"My son absolutely likes this game, it keeps him absorbed for quite awhile. He likes all of it, from making the creatures to building their homes"
2,not worth the money spent,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas to go with her getting the Leapster for Christmas....this game didn't get opened for about 3 weeks after, it didn't interest her until then....and that was where the interest stopped. While it does allow your kids to have some creativity, it is a boring game for kids, and we cannot give this away to anyone we know with a Leapster because they feel the same about it."
5,Perfect in every way!,I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas and she absolutley loved it. Couldn't get her to stop playing it!
5,Beat Creative Game!,"What a fun game! Creative, full of hidden gems, and fun for the everyone in the house!"
2,What Happens When You Let Anybody Publish Their Own Book,"This book is Patti Lewis' fight back against when she was wronged by the Mohave County government. The book reads like a poorly written stream of conscious lashout by someone who is seething with anger. As the book was given as a gift by someone who knows the author, I started reading with interest, but was painfully bored by the third chapter and skimmed through the rest in order to try to give it a shot. I give Patti Lewis credit for fighting back against hard odds and even going so far as to write a quickly produced 305-page documentation of her efforts complete with point-and-shoot color pictures that look like evidence entered with the court.Basically, unless you have personal ties to the author or are tied to her particular Mohave County, Arizona complaints, you will want to pass on this book."
1,Too Difficult,"We love big jigsaw puzzles but had to give up on this one. We got the wine bottles put together with a great deal of work but the cabinet was impossible. There was not enough differentiation in the various parts of the wood to give any clues for where pieces went. After considerable trial and error, we decided to put this aside to give away. Perhaps someone else will have better luck."
1,ugh,"wow was i fooled..i saw the cover and was like wow..looks like it could be something along the lines of ""the virgin suicides"" wtf...i was so wrong its not funny...some nunish college girlinherits her uncles stip club, and yea...i was pretty pissed...cuz the acting sucked, and sex scence sucked worse, and...ugh Hillz was better than this...and i agree with the 1st person, after the 2nd sex scene i just FF the rest of it so i could hurry up and get it over with so my money wasnt a total waste..bad call"
1,Hate the flavor,"I don't like the flavor, and found it too hard to hide it. It didn't mix well in my blender. I threw in everything to hide it - bananas, juice, nothing worked. Not the seller's fault though. It was delivered on time and packaged well - I just hate the stuff."
2,Good Story,This is a good story about adoption but not all that informative on how to go about the process.
2,Religious book with an innaccurate title,"You can't tell from the summary that this is a Christian inspirational book, with numerous stories about people who have adopted and how God percieves this in scriptures. The title makes it sound like a how-to book for potential adoptive parents, but it has very little information on navigating the process and you'd be much better off finding a more detailed guide if that is your need. I'm sure this book will be wonderful to some people, but not the people they are marketing to with this summary and the failure to reveal the Christian emphasis."
1,"Junk, Like everyone else has said.","I got a year out of mine. Then it stopped working. I opened it up to find a little glass looking component that i've never seen before in my 13 years of working with electronics broken.Also you have to slide the battery cover slightly to get it to turn off, which wears the contact points. JUNK is about the right description for this caliper."
3,A great book for crystal lovers,"This book explores the author's theosophy of how certain spiritual beings use crystals--diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, amethyst, etc. Explains how people can use crystals and ""communicate"" with the spiritual beings in everyday life."
1,Don't Bother,"Unless you are thoroghly initiated into Mrs. Prophet's esoteric beliefs, I would not recommend this book. Throughout its entirety, the author speaks to the reader as if her word was law, and you are accepting it without question. Not only that, but at certain points, the author completely loses her train of thought and branches off into something else. I read up to the second chapter, and I literally threw the book out. So if you are looking for some spiritual fulfillment, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
1,always late,i find this paper usually late. if you are planning to use this for an auction guide you will be disappointed. usually it is suppose to arrive on saturday and it may be monday or as late as wednesday extremly unreliable
5,great queen size,"I purchased this for urgent use in case some friends visit us, and it was really of great use, easy to manipulate, soft as normal mattress. Very good airbed."
4,Seems to be working fine,"I already left a previous review on this. Seems to be working fine. I followed the directions to the ""T"" when charging the pump and let it charge for a full 24 hours before inflating the bed, just to see if it worked o.k. Haven't used the bed yet, so I wouldn't be a reliable source for feedback. Hopefully will have lots of years of wear and tear for the price that I paid!"
1,Horrible,Ordering Aero beds is a gamble. Don't place all your faith in this bed for extremely important events. I never got to sleep on mine because it could not hold air. I am returning it and will not re-order.
3,hard to know when fully inflated,according to the directions it said you would hear a whistle sound. i kept blowing the thing up after 10 mins i decided to call the customer support number in the instruction booklet. their answer is that you don't hear much of anything when the mattress is fully inflated.
4,Pretty good for the money,"We're very happy with the product, and plan on using it when we have more people than beds and for camping (we really like to rough it...) Quality seems very good. We like the additional cushioning at the one end, like a pillow. Inflates quickly and firmly (on battery). Which is really the only down side I see, as others have noted. You have to have the battery charged in order to use it, or have a car. If you plan ahead, there's no issue, but if you leave the battery discharged (as you should), you need to remember to charge it before your guests come over. Again, a non-issue if you're going camping and have your car nearby. Probably a cost saving measure on the design. So if you know it going in, you should be pleased. Side note: on the preliminary charge (to test it), I could have inflated it 4-5 times. Although, it probably wouldn't have been as firm on the last 2 times."
1,"useless, deflates overnight","I bought this thing new from amazon.com and it just doesn't work. After inflation, it's difficult to put the cap back on without losing a whole bunch of air, and then, it just deflates overnight. I was going to send it back for a replacement but it's not worth the effort, just threw it in the trash. A waste."
4,Camping in the rain,"I purchased this item specifically for a first time camper to use. Not only were we impressed but found that it was comfortable enough to use for company when we need an extra bed.I was impressed by the durability of this item and the fact that it inflated in no time flat.It poured on this camping trip and we were able to stay above the water that managed to seep into out tent along the floor seams.All in all, it was a more than worthwhile purchase and I would recommend this item for campers with or without experience."
2,Disappointed,We purchased this for when we had unexpected guests. This bed only lasted one use. We woke up to find our guests on the couch because the air bed deflated halfway through the night. We checked for holes but couldn't find one. We ended up just throwing it away.
4,Great extra beds!,I choose these mattresses because they stay filled up overnight. The twin size is awesome to fit in smaller areas.
5,Great choice.,"I got this bed at a discount with Amazon points for my friend, who is sleeping on the floor.It came with no leaks. She is very pleased with the comfort and convenience, as well as withthe fact that she can plug it into a car lighter (she is an overnight truck driver).A very good purchase, all in all. Would definitely choose this bed again."
4,A really great air mattress,"We have now used this mattress twice. We are really happy with its function and how comfortable it is. We have used it on hard ground when we were camping and we have used it on carpet. It is a really great product. If you are looking for a camping mattress, this is a good one."
2,One HUGE drawback.,"One very important warning: This bed can ONLY be inflated after the pump has been plugged into a wall outlet and fully charged OR immediately if the pump is plugged into a car cigarette lighter with the provided adapter. It CAN NOT be inflated immediately when plugged into a wall outlet. The normal charge time is 12 hrs, but the initial charge time is 24 hrs. Thus, if you want to use it in your home, you MUST either still inflate it using a car cigarette lighter or wait 12-24 hrs before inflating it.I've never before seen any chargable appliance that won't work immediately when plugged into a wall outlet. I have no idea why it will work immediately plugged into a car but not plugged into a wall outlet. Seems like a limitation of the wall AC adapter."
3,"Comfortable, but issues with the pump","I got this product, and took it out on a weekend camping trip almost immediately. I was able to inflate it using the pump and the charger outlet in my car without an issue, and the mattress was VERY comfortable - better than any I'd used in the past.The next weekend, I went to inflate it as a guest bed in my home, and found that it cannot take a direct AC power source - it must charge first. I then left the pump to charge for 24 hours, and it *still* would not hold enough juice to inflate the bed. It turns out my room mate had the same pump, and when I charged hers, it had the same issue.The mattress itself is wonderful, and provides a good night's sleep. However, the pump only seems to work on a DC (Car adapter) power source, and I can't seem to find a 3rd Party AC pump that will work with it."
5,Aero Bed has learned from mistakes,"My last Aero Bed was lumpy, uncomfortable, and not very durable. I used it twice a year and it broke in about six years. It was uncomfortable to the point that my wife would prefer paying for a hotel to sleeping on it. This one is comfortable (not like a regular bed, but still very nice for a portable) and it is durable (the material is thicker and the seams are wider). I recommend this for camping or just for visiting people without a spare bed.If you have the money, there is a version with memory foam on it. It is much larger and not practical for every use, but if you have the money and it is staying in one place waiting for a guest to use it, that is a better bed by far..."
1,very disappointing product,"It lasted all of 1 month and, inexplicably, started to deflate. when reinflated, the deflation rate increased so that now, it deflates in 1 hour. this is the 4th one i purchased from this company and they all had the same problem. I could have purchased a ""real"" bed with the amount on money I've wasted on this company and their products."
3,"good bed, bad pump","I gave this 3 stars because the mattress itself is very nice and durable, but the pump sucks..we've had it for about 2 years now and used it probably 10 times and the pump battery won't charge up anymore, making it totally useless. Also, due to the screw on design it makes it difficult to use this mattress with a standard replacement pump. That will force me to have to buy a replacement aero sport pump at the tune of $40 which I'm not happy about. It's a big waste of materials to just throw this old pump away.. why not make the battery replaceable? Silly stupid design on the pump features of this mattress, but the mattress itself is very nice. It is quite heavy so not appropriate for hiking, but if you are a car camper, its great for that."
3,Better than the floor,"The pump is great. Fills fast and empties fast. The bed has all these humps and holes that takes some getting use to. The pillow is also humps and holes and high. This makes using a normal pillow way too high and it's hard to find the right ""hole"" to put your head in. I'll sleep with my head on the other end next time and use a normal pillow."
4,Comfy air bed,"I'm not quiet sure how much more rugged this bed is compared to non-all terrain bed but I found this bed to be pretty good. One small annoyance...it seems it doesn't hold air quite as well as it should. After a day in and inflated state I seem to have to add air to get it up to snuff. Friends say I shouldn't need to do this. Oh well guess I could talk to Aero reps about this. Anyway the bed is a good size (queen), it inflates and deflates quick. The pump comes with ac/dc charger which is nice. I'd recommend it."
2,Come on!!!!!!!,Can't SOMEBODY out there make an inflatable mattress that doesn't leak? It's the 21st century for cryin' out loud!! I lost a lot of sleep.
1,Poor Quality,One of the seams split the first night. It was pretty comfortable until it went flat. I would suggest a different brand.
3,"We really want to like this product, but...","The bed is great! We love it a lot! Easy to pump up, and easy to roll down. The bed itself gets our 5 stars. But the electric pump is just not usable. So we have to give it 3 stars in total :(First pump worked for few times. So we thought that maybe we dropped it on the hard floor... So we bought another bed--because we really liked the bed itself, we thought that getting a new electric pump will allow us to have two camp beds. Then, the new pump didn't work at all. We should have sent them both back. But we really like the beds...We now use a hair dryer and manual mouth-to-mouth pumping which work pretty well since we only need them for our house guests. But if you are getting it for camping, we don't recommend it at all."
2,Ho-hum,"Been there. Done that. While it clearly says on the cover ""inspired by The Scarlet Pimpernel"" that doesn't quite cover it. Perhaps it should say ""insipid copy of Scarlet Pimpernel"". . .but not bothered with all that character development stuff. It's not that the hero isn't likable or that the heroine isn't likable, it's that the whole book is predictable. The story takes the well worn path without finding any new bumps in the road. I don't mind following formula, but I would like some interesting twists of character, turns of phrase, or just my fair share of delicious scenes. This book just didn't deliver that. It's not that the book is bad (it's not that original) it's just I've read it before, and I'll read it again -- better. All in all, I found this one very forgetable."
3,Okay but not up to The Scarlette Pimpernal,"If one has never read the Scarlette Pimpernal, then this an excellent book. For those that have, it's not a bad book, but you find yourself missing the excitement of the original. The plot is fast-paced, but there is no real sense of urgency here, you never wait with baited breath to find out what happens next. That's what I loved about the original, and what i missed here"
1,NO - THESE ARE JUNK,"I am frankly at a COMPLETE loss to understand WHO wrote the positive reviews here. Are these employees of the company? I think they MUST be, because this zipper is a cheap piece of junk. This product is SO incredibly cheaply made, I CAN'T imagine WHO uses it, and for what? TWO attempts to use this product failed almost instantly. The zipper teeth are made from an incredibly cheap plastic. I wasn't rough with them at all and they broke; and there was NO possibility of repair. I was totally shocked at how flimsy the zipper is... HOW in the world does this work for ""tarps?"" People yank on tarps... it's ludicrous. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK PRODUCT!!! You can find these in stores. I recommend you take the time to look at them in your local hardware store before you order them online. Look at the plastic teeth, how the teeth are connected to the fabric, and how flimsy the fabric itself is... JUNK!"
4,Zipper in my bivy,"I used this to turn my emergency bivy into a zipper-able enclosure. Added weight and bulk, but really neat setup"
1,Political Ranting,"After tolerating the tedious chapters of this book, I would suggest that those desiring an unbiased work look elsewhere. There are always complaints about the motivations behind one book or another, so one must keep something in mind: does the book inform or just preach? This book does the latter. There are a few useful tidbits of information dispersed in this lengthy work, but the time spent separating the fact from opinion would likely be better invested on a different book. I bought this book at the same time as ""The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey: A Disputed Genocide"", and would suggest the other as an unbiased examination of the issue. A suggestion, as well: read Article II of the Genocide Convention of 1948 before you start on the history. It's much easier to formulate an opinion when the terms are defined."
1,Truth or Myth?,"It's really disappointing to see such a marketing giant as Amazon.com publish reviews to support this publication only. I have been trying to post a review for this book several times but Amazon.com has not accepted them. My review in fact contains professional review published by The Times Literary Supplement (London), www.the-tls.co.uk by Andrew Mango. I truly believe that, nowadays, in the 21st century every individual has a right to express their opinion in a free manner and Amazon should not be depriving them of these rights."
5,A POWERFUL WORK,"The Armenian Genocide that began in World WarI, during the drive to transform the plural Ottoman Empire into a monoethnic Turkey, removed a people from its homeland and erased most evidence of their three-thousand-year-old material and spiritual culture.For the rest of this century, changing world events, calculated silence, and active suppresion of memory have overshadowed the initial global outrage and have threatened to make this calamity ""the forgotten genocide"" of world history.This book is a much-needed act of acute historical memory.Thank you Mr.Balakian for this powerful work, particulary powerful in exploding the myths of denial and demonstrating how power and careerism corrupt scholars and scholarship to the detriment of truth and common decency.This book needs to be widely read."
5,Burning Tigris,"Beautifully written and researched, Burning Tigris will give you some insight into the countries, and their peoples, that we are currently trying to democratize."
5,An oft-overlooked aspect of the Armenian Massacres,"The reason I bought the Burning Tigris is that, unlike some histories of the Armenian Massacre, it gives extensive information about those around the world who DID care, who DID help. Too often I've heard people say, ""No one did anything to help."" But it is heartening to know that many did try, and that America was in the forefront. The record of the efforts to alleviate the suffering of the victims, and protest the genocide serves in itself as a proof that this atrocity occurred.Sadly, denial and persecution continues, as one may see by some of the reviews here. However, Armenians have all the more reason to be grateful to America for giving us freedom and safety. Writing bad reviews and denying facts is the worst Ottoman-defending Turks can do to us now."
2,A Good Overview of the Armenian Genocide,"This book is a good overview of the Armenian genocide for those who may not be familiar with the issue. However I was dissapointed by the lack of original material (including photographs) or interpretation. If you have read books by Vahakn Dadrian, Richard Hovannisian,""Ambassador Morgenthau's Story"" and others then you will find that over 3/4 of the book is simply a review of existing published material. The only section I found unique and interesting was Part I of the book; ""The Emergence of International Human Rights in America: The Armenian Massacres in the 1890's"". Having said all this though I believe the book will do well and is written in an accesible fashion for those who may not like more scholarly books like those of Vahakn Dadrian and Richard Hovannisian."
4,"Good, quality speed square","I bought it because the edges are wider than the squares at the local home improvement stores. Has better feel andeasier to use. I would have given it 5 stars but mine was not magnetized. I kept it as I currently don't needa magnetized square, but it's not a good indicator of quality control from Swanson, which I never heard of before,except maybe for frozen foods...."
4,Handy for tube layout,A great square has a longer leg on one side making it a snap to layout on large(6'' and above) large radius metal tubing. Try it you'll like it.
1,Misleading / wrong description and picture,"Be careful when ordering 'Spectre 5008B Magnabraid Hose Sleeving - 6-Feet Long', the description and picture are wrong and misleading.The picture shows 6 rolls but the packaging contains only 1.In the description you can read 'Diameter range of 1/2"" to 2""' and 'Includes clamps'. Unfortunately, there are no clamps included and the diameter range is wrong, on the package you can read item 5008B is for Radiator hose 1-1/4"" - 1-1/2"" I.D.I'm returning this item for a refund.Note also that the package warns the 6 feet of sleeving will cover approximately 4' to 5' of hose."
2,Horrible Cover-Band Crap,This album is nothing but a bunch of really bad artists who got together and decided to cover club songs with a Casio keyboard and a computer. Very disappointing
2,Run away! Run away!,"This book is basically unreadable. Impenetrable metaphysical terminology is used in dense, convoluted sentences to convey abstruse theories of meaning (at least I think that's what it is) in such a way as to be completely and utterly opaque. Half the time I didn't know what the guy was talking about, and I have a degree in this stuff and belong to Mensa. If you're interested in Turner, you'd do better to look elsewhere.Some good reproductions though, and if you're just interested in the pictures, the price is right. Hence the two stars; the text would be zero, since it's useless."
3,I expected more from Stanley,Review is for the 25-foot rule only. Construction quality is fine. My disappointment is with the features. Lacks measurements on the underside of the tape; should have upper as well as lower lip at tip; and magnet at tip. All useful and available from other manufactures at similar price.
3,Make sure it is what you need!,This cable DOES NOT transfer data - so it was not what we needed for our application (in this case a serial to Ethernet connection that would allow our weather station to send data across our home network).
4,just needed to upgrade from 512 to 1g,Wonderful if you just want to surf and are not into a bunch of downloads.I also have a dv6000. It has always done every thing i need it to do with great speed. I use it to check e-mail and play games on pogo or shop. I also use a wireless router. Vista is also my operating system I did have to adjust settings using less graphics which also speeds up your system.Thinking about getting another one for my kids.
1,Not satisfied.,It's now dead. (added 1/8/10) died about 2 month's ago.Not long after I purchased this the wireles card went out. HP customer service is unresponsive. I actually read that HP lost a class action suit over this very problem.I have a similar model (dv6000) purchased at Fry's. Wish I had something positive to say. The sound & video are OK but not great. Last night I was watching a moving and my clothes dryer down the hallway was on at the time. I could not hear the movie over the sound of the dryer. The video locks ups sometimes when watching streaming video. The worst part is the OS. Windows Vista Premium is worthless. It needs more memory. I had to upgrade the firmware on my wireless router to get a signal. The plastic cover is cheap. I am having buyers remorse.
3,Good Content; Poor tutorials,"I have purchased many computer books over the last 12 years. This one was not one of the better written ones. I was very excited to get this book since I have worked with both XML and Flash, but have never tied them together. While the content of each chapter is sufficiently laid out, the material is not explained very well. The authors use a project(""The Quiz"") that is developed troughout the book. Problem is that the steps for creating the various stages are poorly written and takes several readings to understand what they are doing. The book does not come with a source code CD-ROM as described by Addison Wesley and the website for the book has problems when attempting to download the source. Very frustrating."
3,A disappointing tome,"I have to agree with other users who point out the book's awkward construction. It's sort of a mutant blend of a hands-on how-to book and a broader discussion of Flash and XML. As the authors ramble through the creation of an XML-based quiz engine, they abruptly propose different ways of addressing coding issues, then move on to the discussion of another coding aspect without telling you which of the two or three or four options you should have plugged in in order for the next set of code to work with it.By mid-2004 this approach is even more awkward as you discover that some of the hands-on steps they tell you to carry out no longer work in Flash MX or Flash MX 2004; there's nothing on the cover or the introductory material to warn you that the authors wrote this for Flash 5."
5,A great end- to-end guide,"I used this book to add database capabilities to our flash app, and could not have done it with out it. Well, perhaps that's an exaggeration, but it would have taken *significantly* longer.Getting flash connected to a database requires a combination of good strategy and lots arcane nitpicking details that span multiple knowledge domains. The book brings you along, step by step, in making the app dynamic. The discussions of database design and implementation via PHP and mySQL were very useful.The book was written during the day of Flash 5, but aside from a couple of outdated screen shots, the ActionScript is current with the version 7.There were a couple of places where some explanations were a little light, but all in all, it was worth many times the price I paid for it."
2,A confusing book,"I have purchased this book as a recommended text for a university course and have been disappointed.The text covers the topics I needed to understand, but in a confusing manner - there is plenty of irrelevant content which is meant to build your understanding until optimal solutions are developed at the end of each chapter. I have found this to create more confusion than the benefit it delivers.It is not that good for a beginner as the early part is poorly written. It does get better though in the later chapters, so more experienced readers may gain some benefit.Overall I did not find it very readable and have begun using other texts to understand the individual various topics before tackling this text."
3,Mixed review,"I bought this book just by looking at the first few chapters. I liked the sort of pacing that the authors offered. HOWEVER, upon reading further (beginning from around Chapter 7 onwards) I began having difficulties with the exercises and the ideas.(1) It seems like it's broken up in some parts and it's hard to follow the code. You don't know where to put the code; on a movieclip, on the timeline or in a nested clip.(2) The code in the book contain errors that would be excusable if they had a decent errata on the website. The website does not have this. The forum doesn't even work.I'm mixed. The authors are very good in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) but ""ok"" to ""poor"" in teaching these ideas. I bought it. It's not worth every dime, but it'll be on my shelf until someone agrees to pay half of what I paid."
1,Misleading Format,"I bought this book thinking it would be a great resource for developing Flash applications with XML data. Turns out, it's only good at taking up space on my bookshelf. The entire book is one long boring case study of some stupid quiz application. The methods used are hardly applicable to other applications and I have had to resort to other sources for information. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Waste of a day,"I gave this one star only for the beginning of the XML portion. It started out great and made alot of sense. By page 118 I wanted to slam my head into the wall. I must have about 100 Flash/PHP/mySQL etc books and I know how to follow examples. After struggling with this book, my quest for learning has now extended to building myself a Kevorkian machine.I'm sorry fellas, I REALLY wanted to like this book."
1,Poor movie,very poor acting and misleading titel not even close to the poorest documentary of Dego Maradona.
2,Paper Flashcards in the Internet Age? Pass,"First off, look at the price. 100 dollars is three to four times what you paid for the RTK book. Next, you're not getting much more than what is offered by other Kanji cards being sold. It does not take much to buy a higher quality, lower cost card set and write in the RTK keyword on your own. Third, you have MUCH, MUCH better results using online flashcard sites to utilize the Spaced Repetition System (SRS) concept for more efficient studyinglreviewing.Don't get me wrong, I developed 500 paper flash cards for RTK prior to moving onto online review sites. Had I been able to buy these then, I would have just to save me the hassle (other reviews say the same thing). Now that I have 18 months of experience with RTK, let me say you are better off online, especially when you get upto 1000 or more kanji to study.Google ""reviewing"" and ""kanji"" should get you the proper website that compliments Remembering the Kanji much better than these flashcards ever will."
1,Spotted some kanji errors,"These would be a great set of cards except that they contain a few kanji errors (although the book correctly portrays the kanji). I'm only about 335 kanji into the cards, but noticed errors in the following kanji: ""treetops"" (#201), ""say"" (#335), and all kanji using the ""say"" primitive. This is frustrating. We beginners should not be forced to proofread kanji we have just learned."
4,Kanji Study Cards,"The study cards work well with Heisig's ""Remembering the Kanji"" book. I miss not having the stroke order on the cards but realize that the smaller card makes this difficult. It's nice having all the cards in one box and the dividers help keep everything in order."
2,"This is not a book, this is a laminated double-sided piece","of paper. There are some good tips, but it is not fair to characterize this as a ""full color book,"" and I am pretty irritated about it! Also, the ""Boys' Book"" and the ""Girls' Book"" are word for word identical in most places, only a couple of the suggested games are different. If you're just looking for a handy quick tips guide on throwing a kid's party, this would be great for you, but if you're looking for something more comprehensive, move on to another book!"
3,A smorgasbord of vintage terror treats,"Reading the two reviews was helpful. The Salter/Skinner Son of Frankenstein cd is a favorite of mine. Now we need to see new symphony recordings of Karl Hajos' Werewolf of London score and Heinz Roemheld's Invisible Man music. Buster Crabbe's Flash Gordon borrowed from both of these, and fans of Universal Studios horror/suspense music know how great all the music was on that 1930s serial. You can access some great music clips at Tony LoBue's Flash Gordon web site."
4,Unforgettable sounds of Horror,"Growing up and watching the great Universal horror movies on late night TV, I as most kids did, became infatuated with the classic movie monsters of the 30's and 40's. Now, here in one collection are most of the opening soundtracks from these legendary horror films. The creepy swan lake suite from Dracula to the thunderous music of impending doom that started most of the Frankenstein movies. And, who could forget that classic score from The Wolfman with Lon Chaney. Most tracks are lifted directly off the movie soundtracks, so slight background sounds can be heard, but that just adds to the enjoyment. The opening to Dracula, is NOT the original from the movie, it seems the first few bars have been edited and a different version added in. All in all, this is a MUST for classic horror fans. Try puttting on this disc, and guessing what movie each track is from, it will bring back haunting memories of stormy dark nights where the monsters truly roamed our imagination..."
2,Beyond boring,"""Beyond Velikovsky"" is an incredibly boring and badly written book, which almost put me to sleep. Is this how Henry H. Bauer sounded like when lecturing about chemistry to his students? Thank Geezus I wasn't one of them (I had a straight A in chemistry in junior high, incidentally).The fact that Bauer believes in the Loch Ness monster while dissing poor Velikovsky's absurd ideas about gravity is mildly entertaining, however. He kindly informs us that Nessie has flippers. Apparently, Bauer later became a true believer in UFOs, as well. Presumably, they obey the laws of gravity?If you are a really crazy Velikovsky or anti-Velikovsky buff (or buffoon), I suppose you just must have ""Beyond Velikovsky"" in your private little stash.The rest of the world need not bother.PS. I agree with the author that V was indeed a crank. In fact, he was the crank to end all cranks. I do of course disagree with Mr. Bauer on questions pertaining to skin colour and the n-word.Jupiter station, over and out."
2,Multiple problems - maybe me or maybe product,"I have had the following problems with the Rangebooster. I would rate myself at a 7 out of 10 for installation and technical proficiency with Windows. First, the Rangebooster is not consistent in maintaining a connection; second, the Connection manager/wizard will not open; third, the D-Link webpage has upgraded software, and the software's executable file will not install when unzipped and selected; finally, inconsistent access to network - problems acquiring network address."
3,Good but not great.,"In order to use this product with Windows Vista Home Premium (64 bit), I had to search the net for drivers. I finally found the right driver which was actually the one for a Netgear WN111 USB wireless adapter. When installed, the D-Link adapter worked. The only continuing problem that I and others have had with the adapter is that it quits working if the computer goes into sleep mode. You must then either restart the computer or disable then re-enable the wireless adapter to get the D-Link working again. If you can live with these issues, the adapter is fast and works well."
5,Out of the box and running in 5 minutes,"Setup was a snap. Took it out of the box, downloaded the latest driver from the D-link website and attached it to my wireless network without a problem. In terms of setup/configuration, it has been the easiest wireless adapter I've ever used. Range is excellent too. I may have avoided problems others have experienced by downloading the latest driver from the website, as opposed to using the one included on the CD."
3,michael ondatje,I read this book because I was writing my graduation thesys on this Canadian author. It was useful to me. Katia Varlese.
5,Lip Ink Int'l Miracle BrowLiner,"I originally purchased the brown brow liner, it was too dark for me, Lip Ink was more than hospitable in exchanging it for taupe, which I got today, and it is the PERFECT color!!!!!!!!!! Thank you so very much for working so well with me! The taupe is a much better color match for me and my hair is Herbal Natural Instincts 5C medium brown."
4,spirited electronica,"Ah, the cafeteria-experience of post-modern music! This electronica album is a sensual delight. Sometimes it's analog yet exotic, as when the singer uses Mongolian harmonic-overtone vocal techniques to produce 3 separate notes simultaneously! Of course when he does this, as on Gershwin's Summertime, he sounds like he's channeling Tom Waits!! Othertimes, it's digital and spacy, as in the Spruce Goose Icarus. It doesn't get five stars because the lyrics never live up to the music."
5,outstanding,my husband loved it and it met my greatest expectations. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to give it as a gift
3,Not What I Expected,"I love Burberry London. However, when I ordered this I received Burberry. My fault - I thought they might have changed the packaging and used it. Mistake - it wasn't the same cologne. Should have sent it back but didn't. Anyway, to recap: love Burberry London, like Burberry, but if you order make sure the package looks like the bottle pictured; if not, SEND IT BACK!"
