3,the movies,"I am a huge fan of sandbox games like rollercoaster tycoon etc... This game is very very fun in the begining of play, but as your park gets bigger and bigger it seems like a cluster of things that don't really work well together and it starts feeling like you see the same movie over and over again(unless you make them all yourself, which is hard and annoying in some ways). But overall this is a very good idea for a game but not very well polished, I was expecting alot more, and was let down."
3,A fun distraction for a while,"I really love the Tycoon-style games, and was hoping this one of that type. While it is amusing, it does not require nearly the strategy and brain power I was expecting. You can make ""movies"" within the game, but are so limited by the available scenes that the movies are jarring and odd. The management aspect of the game is lacking as well, since after a while you are just doing the same things over and over again -- it got repetitive and boring. The radio announcer in the background is great and very amusing.I did get some enjoyment out of this game -- a little brainless fun and something for my husband to tease me about."
4,Awesome!,"I love this game. Its is addictive! You have to be paietent though. You starts out in the year 1920 then I guess you just work up. I'm in the year 1930 right now...I just got it yesterday. I think this game is really fun and you should get it,if you are going to take your time to learn it. I personally love it! I'm 10 so now you know your getting this advice from a 10 year old. I hope this review was helpfull!Ps. BUY IT!"
2,Very repetitive,"Well, it's fun for the first day or two, but it gets very repetitive and irritating after awhile..."
2,Quickly lost its luster,"I do not want to worry about hiring janitors, searching for extras, worrying about the landscape of my studio lot, constructing toilets, or any other of the micromanaging chores involved in running a studio. I want to build stars, direct films, and create cinematic masterpieces. There are so many distractions away from the main goal that one barely has time to enjoy the movie making experience. Bad enough I have to spend forever worrying about side projects, but the movie making software itself is flawed limiting what types of flicks I can even make. What could have been. What could have been. When one turns the entertainment industry into a boring exercise then one knows they have failed utterly."
5,THIS WATCH IS SOOOO HOT!!,"I just recieved this watch from amazon.com, and when I opened the iconic yellow box, my breath was taken away. This is truly a beautiful watch, and looks so much more luxe than the price that you pay for it. The gold color is so rich looking and the MOP face is so stunning. I know that some folks claim that Invictas are cumbersome, but this was not the case for me with this time piece. The dial is very ladylike to me and you can wear it going out or as an everyday piece. I appreciate the free five year warranty given to me and going on line to register the time piece was a cinch. This is my second Invicta, but certainly not my last."
3,"""Hard to tell""",Cute watch but too small. Im a tall women and from the reviews it was stated that this was a fairly large watch. I wish i would have done a little more looking before spending my money on this watch. If you are a petite women than you may like it because it is a pretty watch.
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in this watch. It stopped working 6 times in one day. That was not the only time it stopped while I was wearing it. Unfortunately, I am unable to return since I let the 30 days pass and now I am unable to return.Invicta Women's Pro Diver Collection Lady Abyss Watch #2963Invicta Women's Pro Divers Watch #2903"
2,Alternate Version of Slayers (season 1),"This series of books follows (as you'll find in book two) the story arc of the first season of Slayers, with a whole lot of minor changes here and there. The major problem with these books (besides being formatted for American readers but still containing some mis-panellings) is that the anime series is so vivaciously voiced and well-directed that it's difficult to stick the characters on flat paper and then read their words. The paper format works better for Lina & Naga where their adventures are really little more than cutting one-liners about discreet events on the way to a meal. Comparing the paper to the series, however, it falls short of giving us the long-running complex characters that the anime gives us."
2,Disappointed,This definitely was not what my kids and I were expecting - christmas you would think would mean christmas episodes but not so much
3,Disappointing,"The selection of programs didn't fit the title. Only three of the programs involved Christmas and a couple weren't worth the time to watch. On the good side, the product was received in excellent condition and played without difficulty."
5,ISSEP CBK,"This book is a must have book for preparation and study for the ISSEP exam as of October 23, 2005. This book also has good study questions for each chapter at the end of the book to guide you in testing your knowledge per chapter. The book also goes into additional details in some areas to provide more information to the security pactitioner. The author provides an e-mail address for errata in the book.The down sides to the book are that none of the unclassified public documents are available on CD with the book and no electronic quiz program are included. There are reference lists at the end of each chapter showing the links to download the public documents."
2,Someone please offer a new book on this subject!,"There is enough information in the book to pass the ISSEP, provided you already possess a strong IA foundation. Recommend also reading the source documents, especially the IATF and CC, to improve your odds of passing the exam the first time. Also recommend looking at the ISSEP section in the latest Krutz and Vines CISSP study guide."
2,"Okay, but dated","While most of the information in this book is okay, this book is dated and is missing a lot of key essentials. The _FISMA Certification and Accreditation Handbook_ has more in depth information."
2,Maybe not for me,"I've held a CISSP for 6 years and been active in DOD computer security for well over a decade, but I simply couldn't get through this well enough to even attempt a test. Somehow the concepts presented simply didn't sink in well enough for me to feel good enough to pony up $500 for a test seat."
3,A bit too high level,"This book is actually pretty good but I kept comparing to the Shon Harris CISSP book. This book is very high level and is not recommended for beginners.I would recommend this book only for security profssionals with more than 3 years of experience. If you are a beginner, get the Shon Harris book."
4,Great book for fans of horses and movie stars,"I've been a horse lover since I got my first pony at the age of six. I am also a working entertainment reporter, so I am always on the lookout to talk to celebs who have horses -- but this book taught even me a few things! Who knew Chevy Chase has Icelandics? That's my favorite breed!People We Know, Horses They Love is not only very well-written and informative, but the pictures are beautiful too. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because that rating for horse/picture books is reserved for Robert Vavra :)Staci Layne Wilson"
2,"Not Enough Horse, Too Much Hype","Where should I start? With the many blurry, grainy photos? Or the photos of celebrities and horses that are hugely under exposed so the ""background"" can come shining through? I thought I'd get to see celebrities with their horses - in focus. Disappointing photography.The interviews sound somewhat ""canned"" and ""redundant"". As though the celebrities were asked to fill in a form and then the interview was written from the form.Why two stars? Page 1, Richard Gere and his horse; Page 13 Robert Duvall and horse; Page 89 Kim Novak and her horse."
2,Too jazzy,"I bought this for my parents thinking it was nice soulful, gospel music. I don't know what it is, but none of us like it. This will be the last time I buy an Amazon CD that doesn't offer samples. I'm not saying it is bad, just not our kind of music."
3,Gospel DVD,"Dream On: Live From Chicago (DVD-Amaray)I generally enjoy the Signature Sound DVD's and have all of them since the first one when they were just ""Signature Sound Quartet"". This is the first one I have seen that does not live up to their usual Great Performances. Maybe it is the fact that there is too much 'sight seeing' in Chicago and not enough singing! Does not meet the generally high entertainment standards of the others."
5,Dream On Signature Sound,"I can't get enough of this marvelous quartette.And this last one, is their best.I love them all,however.They are so inspired, gifted and annointed andI thank our Lord for this ministry. Was good to see theirfamilies on this one, too.Thank you, Ernie and the boys, (men)"
5,I AGREE,"MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE SEEN THEM LIVE. ERNIE AND SIGNATURE SOUND HAVE SUCH A HIGH ENERGY , THEY SEEM TO KEEP GETTING BETTER AND ARE SUCH FUN. I WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM ORDERING THIS IN ADVANCE. OR EVEN SENDING IT AS A GIFT."
1,BAD STORY(...) GOOD ART!!,When I first bought this book I thought it would be good because it had fantastic art. BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. OKAY the art was pretty good but the story stopped me from giving this book another star.
5,Very good'product almost like OEM,Requiere some drilling and you need to prepare the surface prior to be drilled. The rails went right on they fit exactly in my roof and seem sturdy enought to carry my ocean kayac.
1,"Outdated and irrelevant, don't bother.","This work is outdated and expensive compared to other available texts or even free information on the internet, don't bother purchashing it."
4,An Entertaining Book,"I am glad I ordered The Devil's in the Details by Mary Jane Maffini. Camilla MacFee's edges have softened, and she's more likable than ever. The very beginning of Chapter 29 had me in tears from laughing so hard.Because Camilla cares so much about people who need her help, she winds up on the wrong end of the law. Alvin and Mrs. Parnell cheer her on from the sidelines, so they are involved just enough to make it fun, but not so much that we get tired of them."
5,Outstanding customer service,"I ordered an out of print book from the Book Depository. My book was due to be delivered by Dec. 15th and did not have a way to track it. When it didn't arrive by the morning of the 18th, I emailed the company. USPS delivered the book at 5 PM that day in perfect condition. I emailed them again later in the day to let them know. They responded to each of my messages promptly and courteously, promising to do whatever needed to make it right. This morning, 6 days later, I got a message explaining to customers that increased US security measures have delayed shipments from their UK warehouse and apologizing for any inconvenience with the delays (which are not their fault). I am totally impressed with their customer service, and would not hesitate to order again from them and recommend them to my friends. I thought I had already sent in a review for this purchase, but amazon emailed me again do to so, so I am."
2,This product is no longer valid!,"Don't be misled - this older product is a worthwhile review of reading comprehension, but it doesn't cover the latest exams. Instead, see the 2005 version."
4,A Beautiful Place,"I read this book in two sittings,barely able to put it down. Peter Morgan's description of the ill-fated Saint Pierre painted pictures in my mind. The horror of that fateful day in 1902 I felt was portrayed in an honest yet respectful manner. The only thing I was disapointed with was that there wasn't as much information on Ludger Sylbaris as I had anticipated. Despite this I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in history or volcanoes."
5,Great for little ones who are bored with storylines,"This particular DVD is great for my 15 month old. If your child just likes to dance, sing or listen to music this is the one for you. The special features offer a section called ""Jukebox"" where only the songs (along with the video)will play. Since those children younger than two may have a difficult time following storylines or conceptualizing, parents can skip the actual video that combines Barney reminiscing with BJ and Baby Bop about the past with music and singing and go straight to music/singing without a delay between songs. However, if you have a child who enjoys storylines, you can have that as well! This video is great for kids 6 mos- to 7 years old!"
5,Barney's Musical Scrapbook,The product received was as described. It is a very entertaining DVD to have for your toddler.
4,Great for kids,I have a 3 y/o daughter that just loves Barney. She has this movie and aslo loves it. It has a good selection of songs on it and good in running length for the price.
5,"Excelent for fun, learning, watching and singing!","My three-year old daughter just loves it! I do too! The music is great, the themes are fun. I totally recommend it!"
2,What the heck is this?,"If you want blues, dont buy this. It's sort of a demonstration of harmonica technique but it lacks heart and soul."
1,Good Information but Poorly Arranged,"I found this book to have a major flaw in it's organization. There is a useful information about the customs and mannerisms of people from various cultures, but it is arranged by subject rather than by location. For instance, information about people from Taiwan might be located in several sections throughout the book, within sections such as ""Greetings"", ""Holidays"", etc. Each of these sections contains very brief information about the topic as it pertains to people from a few (not all) different countries. I find this layout to be very problematic. If I am in need of information about a different culture, most likely because I am either travelling to a certain country or will be interacting with a person from a certain country, it would be much easer to have information organized by location. One section on ""Taiwan"", etc., rather than having to look in multiple places throughout the book for what ends up being a sentence or two worth of limited information."
2,Too broad,"Etiquette is strongly based on culture and even within a country, geographical differences will impact the local culture so what might been deemed acceptable in the south, may be quite different in the north. To lump multi-countries' culture into generic headings makes this book way too broad that it becomes totally useless!"
5,French Deee-Lite meets British oddball songwriter Momus,"Brit songwriter (eccentric at that) Momus found Laila France, a young plastics student via an ad he placed in a Paris newspaper. Her deadpan smooth 'n' sexy voice purrs camp yet sultry lyrics over Momus' Serge Gainsbourg meets Deee Lite music. There's also some drum 'n' bass added for effect on some more club focussed remixes. Really cool and atypical of the new French music."
1,Not necessarily a Hillary fan but........,"I could not even finish the book. The negativity in virtually every chapter oppressed my soul. I wanted facts and to gain some knowledge about Hillary, and all I got was nausea. Milton's bias was oozing from every page. The information was second, third, and fourth hand, unsubstantiated, and based on assumptions and innuendo. It was like reading a tabloid that went on for over 400 pages. Milton spent too much time explaining what Hillary thought and what all of her ""ulterior motives"" were for virtually everything she has done in her life thus far. Did she know Hillary's inner thoughts by osmosis or through some Vulcan mind meld? Come on! Don't buy it, don't even check it out from the library. I would have given it a negative 5 rating, but that was not an option. A complete and utter waste of paper and ink."
2,A Strange Melange,"Picked up this audio cassette edition in a remainder bin for $5, and thought I was swindled...The author clearly wants to work a policy agenda, which disagrees a lot with Hillary's position on a wide variety of issues. An especially recurring theme is Hillary's position on family issues; the author would assert that Hillary wants the state to raise children and not mothers and fathers.That being said, there is a lot of stuff in this book which, if halfway true, does form an image of Hillary as a post-hippie policy wonk who has a powerful intellect and strong will. I do think that, nearing the age of 60, Hillary has outgrown a lot of the viewpoints and beliefs attributed to her in this book.And, as others here have said, this book is a scandalmongering exercise, but, well, we must educate ourselves on the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, right? If this is as bad as anyone can possibly paint her, I'd say she's electable..."
1,"Bad as biography, worse as a means to understand HRC.","I find Hillary Rodham Clinton to be a puzzling figure, and looked to this biography to help me sort out the information about her--good and bad. However, this book is nothing new--almost all of it is combed from other published sources. It's only theme about HRC seems to be to point out how evil she is. One revelation is that--surprise surprise--Rodham had inconsistent politics as a college student. There's a shock--she's 20 and changes her mind! Milton throws out spurious information and innuendo and expects the reader to find it reliable. I wouldn't trust any of it. I see it sells for $.70 used--it might be worth that."
1,Thinly disguised hatchet job,"Joyce Milton's ""Partners In Power"" is a thinly-disguised hatchet job. I was amazed by three things, primarily: (1) the omniscience Milton apparently enjoys (i.e., her criticisms of Hillary Clinton require expertise from so many disciplines no human being could master all of them; (2) Milton's access to Hillary Clinton's thought processes (i.e., she repeatedly describes Clinton's thoughts and motivations); and (3) that my public library would have purchase this piece of trash. My assessment: the book will be disgusting to all but the die-hard Clinton haters. Chuck Montgomery Des Moines, IA CMontgo378@aol.com"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENTING PIECE OF GARBAGE,"I eagerly bought this meanspirited diatribe after being enthralled with ""Tramp"". What a vulgar waste of paper. One must question the relaibilty of Ms.Miltons' sources when the simple fact that Bob Kerrey was govenor of Nebraska, not Kansas, evades her."
1,Not worth the reading,Giving this book 1 star is very generous. It's just the same old garbage we've already read. Save your money!!!!
2,Why read what we know and why know what we seldom read!,"I am surprised by Joyce Milton who has written soime terrific books. This is below her class and above her moral character, if one can now kudge her as she did Hillary Rodham. Hillary Rodham is an unfinised story that will change as she matures in public service. She has gone from a ""Goldwater Girl"" to the biggest threat to conservative values in the opinion of her opponents. It is time to cease such books by not buying them. Hillary will be what she wants to be and no book will stop her. Read something else and contribute the money to someone's campaign or your charity. Joyce Milton will be back with another winner of a book, but this is not the one."
1,No reviews since 1999 says it all,"I got this book used and thought it would be interesting to read after the fact of HRC's moving on to other things. Without a doubt I believe the Clinton administration was filled with lies, deceit and well, just plain politics. This book is a discredit to thoughtful readers. I've only thrown away a handful of books in my life and this is one of them."
3,Just saw the author on Christian network,"I bought this book hoping to understand more about this complex woman and her marriage to the President of the United States. Instead I read a very biased account that determined to find every bit of dirt -even critizing her behavior as a teenager. I just saw the author talking to Pat Robertson on a Christian network program and it was preceeded by a ""News Piece"" that was an obvious attempt to trash HRC and her work thus far. Robertson asked very leading questions that allowed Milton to continue pushing her negative views and opinions. In summary a very biased and disappointing book."
4,Great Gloss/Plumper Even Greater Price,"This product is great awesome shine, non greasy with a little plump action!!I Love It!"
2,Their Best Days Behind Them,"The disappointing ""Live at Carnige Hall"" seems to be the beginning of the end of Renaissance. The band's unwillingness (or inability) to show a little spontaneity in their note for note reworking of some of their songs suggested that the band was either beginning to run out of ideas, a notion that was sadly confirmed by its follow-up studio effort ""Novella."" The fatal flaw here is that the band seemed to be putting more effort on expanding the orchestral sound that worked so well on their two best albums, ""Turn of the Cards, and ""Scheherazade"" at the expense of writing actual songs. Sadly, ""Novella"" seems almost devoid of melodies that one remembers 20 seconds after the song is over (although ""The Captive Heart"" comes tantalizingly close). This is all pleasant, competent stuff, and from a music theory standpoint it can even be impressive at times. But it is that over studied fell that, ultimately makes it an album that fails to excite."
4,"Beautiful album, only a tad dreary at times. Amazing vocals!","I always loved this album, by the only (in my opinion) real 70's progressive band with a female lead singer. Annie's voice is incredible, and the harmonies in some of these songs (""Captive Heart"", ""Touching Once"") are so gorgeous they are a real feast for the ears. But others (""The Sisters"", ""Midas Man"") are a bit too slow and dreary. All in all, a must-have for the 70's progressive rock lover with a sensitive side."
2,"Pleasant, but far from memorable","The disappointing ""Live at Carnige Hall"" seems to be the beginning of the end of Renaissance. The band's unwillingness (or inability) to show a little spontaneity in their note for note reworking of some of their songs suggested that the band was either beginning to run out of ideas, a notion that was sadly confirmed by its follow-up studio effort ""Novella.""The fatal flaw here is that the band seemed to be putting more effort on expanding the orchestral sound that worked so well on their two best albums, ""Turn of the Cards, and ""Scheherazade"" at the expense of writing actual songs. Sadly, ""Novella"" seems almost devoid of melodies that one remembers 20 seconds after the song is over (""The Captive Heart"" comes close). This is all pleasant, competent stuff, but ultimately it is an album that fails to excite."
2,Not formatted for Kindle,"I have not finished the book yet (actually, i've barely started) but, please note, the formatting in this book is really poor. you have page numbers in the middle of the paragraphs and the chapter name strolling around.It looks like someone got the original manuscript and just used some cheap ebook creator. I'm going to put up with that for a David Berot book (i have the ""Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up"" in paperback and it was a fantastic read), but i'm disappointed."
5,Invaluable Information,"This book is a very important tool for anyone who wants to obey Jesus Christ's commands and follow Him.Bercot shows from scripture and from the early Christian writers that followers of Jesus are to be obedient citizens of the Kingdom of God. Without a proper understanding of the role the Kingdom plays in God's salvation plan for mankind, it is much more difficult for a believer to comply successfully with Jesus' teachings.Bercot does an excellent job!***Highly recommended.***"
4,Mostly Useful,"I'm currently in the process of reading this book, and on first look over, it looks very concise and in depth. The one thing that I would like to see more of, is notational examples of some of the smaller orchestral percussion. I've taken courses in writing specifically for percussion, so I have my notes, but for someone who does not have access to my file cabinet, it might be frustrating to read about all of the sounds a tambourine can make without seeing how to write them down."
1,Not funny - depressing,"I rented this movie because I wanted to watch something that made me laugh...instead this movie made me scowl and frown the entire time. The whole idea that this is a female version of ""The Hangover"" is completely false. I do not think I laughed out loud once in this movie - whereas ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" both had me cracking up. Instead, I left the movie sad that these women were so horrible. And please don't interpret that as ""so horrible they are funny."""
1,Pathetic,"Thank god no real women I know would ever behave anything like the pathetic, cruel, selfish, unintelligent, underdeveloped women in this film. My sister and I tried to watch until the end, only in the hopes of seeing them all burn in some sort of ""Carrie""-like scene but that didn't happen so we turned it off. ALL of the lead characters; men and women, are pigs. Horrible, borderline sexist stereotypes of women - the bimbo, the bitch, the hot mess. These chicks, if they exist, and again, I'm so glad I've never encountered anyone like them, deserve to be transplanted over to a slasher flick where they can all get what they (cinematically) deserve for being so mean and so pathetic. Get a life! Oh! Almost forgot - not only is it not smart, it's also not funny. Would love a refund if I could get one."
2,lame,Some parts of the movie were funny but all of those parts were shown in the previews. I would not pay to watch it again nor would i watch it again if it was free.
3,not again,"It was alright, not a movie I would watch again. The drug usage was over the top for me and felt that they were trying ro hard to make the movie funny."
1,Mediocre at best,"I you wanna watch a gripping tale on how to be a bitch, coke fiend , an the worst bridesmaids/ friends this is for you. It wasn't tht funny and got way too serious for a comedy. It was a major let down. Every lull in the story I kept turning to my friends and saying so when is this going to start being funny? And it never happened"
2,Performances were fine,"I thought this movie was supposed to be funny. I thought it was actually a downer and kind of mean. The constant cocaine use, if it was supposed to add to the hilarity, just got old and was depressing. The performances by the actresses based on what they were given to work with, were good however, but it was not enough to make me buy this on DVD or watch it again or recommend it to anyone."
1,cruel and unfunny,"I love all of these actors, but this movie was a total waste of their talents. It was uncomfortably, viciously nasty. It was like Heathers w/o Winona and Christian. The characters were all dbags and bitter and disgusting tw*ts."
5,Pleasantly surprised,I hadn't heard about this movie but my girlfriend's a big Party Down fan and had to watch. We both laughed the whole time. The three main actresses are at the top of their game. Highly recommended.
4,LOVE THOSE GALS!!!,LOVED THE MOVIE.....VERY CUTE.....GREAT GROUP OF GIRLS PLAYING IN A COMEDY.....I WANTED MORE BUT IT WAS STILL A GREAT MOVIE.
4,"Very funny; like ""Bridesmaids"" with fewer comedic set pieces","Mainly as a result of seeing the excellent red-band trailer, my wife and I decided to give ""Bachelorette"" a shot. Although the comparisons to ""Bridesmaids"" are inevitable, both of us found this to be the better movie. It relies on well-written jokes and the comedic timing of the actors (specifically Lizzy Caplan and Isla Fisher), while ""Bridesmaids"" relied more on the physical set pieces that Judd Apatow favors. If you found ""Bridesmaids"" to be nice but a bit lacking, I'd recommend giving this a shot."
4,"Hilarious, Funny, Raunchy.","This is a funny movie. All the characters are hot messes and so entertaining. A great cast, lots of cocaine use and dark comedic parts. I watched it twice with two different groups of friends!"
2,Okay for wasting a little time and maybe a few bucks,This movie appeared to be one of those movies where actors must have been desperate for work or someone had money to throw away.Neither my wife nor myself cared for it.
1,Worst movie ever,Cant believe I paid to watch this!! Not a comedy but a true tragedy! The Relationships were very depressing. They were so old to be acting so messed up. Could not wait for it to end!
1,Bachelorette,"Horrible horrible movie!! I think I chuckled once! The rest of it was so lame all they did was say "" let's do coke"" every chance they got. Way lame!!"
2,Great cast but not really funny,"I was expecting more, no plot materialized. Rent something else, save your money. Noting else to say for this review."
1,Horrible,Do waste your money. This is a boring movie and very stupid. In previews it looks that is funny but those previews are the only parts not even that funny in the movie. It is sad to see such of talented actresses to get such of silly roles.
1,Awful,"Predictable, terrible plot and I just want to slap all the characters except the lady who plays the bride. I do not recommend it at all and I didn't find it funny."
4,Not AMAZING but pretty good...,It's a good girl's movie for a night in. Pretty funny and realistic. It's like the real version of Bridesmaids.
3,okay movie,This movie was ok im glad i didn't watch it in the movie theater. it had some humor could of had a littel better ending. This will not be added to my movie collection. It did have some great actors. But you already know what was going to happen.
3,Funny,"This movie was a comedy/ drama to me. I did like this movie overall because it was deeper than i expected. However, if you are looking for a laugh out loud constantly movie this is not it. I did like this more than Bridesmaids too."
2,Rebel yell,Here's the thing: Rebel should never pretend to not have an accent. She should always be funny. These two things are missing in this film. Some giggles but over all...blah.
3,Could be better/worse,"I was looking forward to this movie, but I will say that it left something to be desired. I thought it was going to be more of a comedy than it was and it focused on the people that I didn't think it would. I doubt that I will add it to my movie collection, but it wasn't too bad."
2,Meh....,"I rented this from other reviewers who said it was much more hilarious and more believable than Bridesmaids. Not even close. Some parts made me chuckle but that's about it. Maybe bc I'm not into drugs and I don't clutch onto my highschool years is why I don't find it interesting, just sad that Adam Scott took time doing this movie. While one part of Bridesmaids I didn't find realistic, there were quite a few situations that I did not find realistic with this movie."
3,Watch it for laughs,Dont take this movie too serious. its all in good fun. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that theres some great dialogue referencing 90s teen television .
2,People like this exist?,"Hey, you know that chick who thinks saying catty things with a smile constitutes a sense of humor? This is ""Bridesmaids"" for her."
3,Wife Made Me Watch It...,"Bad behavior makes good comedy, and the characters in this movie are certainly dysfunctional. At the same time, there's actually a plot about friendship, honesty, personal growth, and doing the right thing when it's hard. Much of the humor is predictable by 30 seconds, but the ending was actually refreshing. Ladies, this movie is a solid B for the guy in your life, but if he picks it out on his own, you may be a beard."
3,Decent Chick Flick,"The Hangover for woman is probably a pretty good description. Although, it isn't nearly as funny. I really love all of the actresses, so it was great seeing them act together. The music was also excellent. I think that it would probably be funnier if you have a few drinks in you, and I could definitely do without the added drama."
1,Terrible movie.,"I recommend watching Bridesmaids instead. Plot was awful, characters were awful...found myself yearning for the final credits so I could do something else with my life."
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"That's right, this movie beats Plan 9 from Outer Space for the worst movie I've ever seen. Sorry cruelty is not funny, not even ""smart"" cruelty - the first part of the movie focuses on the degradation of the overweight Rebel Wilson, who is marrying a cute guy. Two of the stars try to get in her large wedding dress and rip it, thereby driving the plot as the three main actors try to fix it. Isla Fisher and Lizzy Caplan spend most of the movie acting like two high very unfunny people. I guess the writer was trying to out-raunch Bridesmaids and therefore be cutting edge but it doesn't work at all. Bridesmaids was a great movie and this one has jokes that are too cruel and too obvious and the gifted Caplan is completely wasted in this film. She and Adam Scott were great in Party Down, which was funny and intelligent. Both Caplan and Scott are mired in this terrible script and the cliched performances demanded of it. If this is where our culture is headed, I want no part of it."
2,not funny,Reading this was compared to and was as funny as Bridemaids give me high hopes. Too bad it wasn't close to being as funny or witty.
3,"Fun movie, terrible picture.","The movie was fun and had some great moments. I recommend the movie, but the picture quality was really terrible."
2,Not as good as Bridesmaids,"Ok, if your bored and nothing else to do. I recommend you watch Bridesmaids instead.- still need 2 words"
3,Funny but not a winner,"The movie frustrated me to no end... Not only did it mess up some scenes that could have been extremely funny, it just went on and on... I can appreciate humor with drugs, but there was a lot of coke. Maybe if they had smoked weed instead of snorting, it would have provided more laughter."
1,Horrible,"This movie is not funny, it was just sad. Rebel Wilson was under utilized-Pitch Perfect is way better and very funny."
2,"Nothing Like Bridesmaids, so don't get your hopes up","Only had a few funny moments, but I pretty much sat through the whole movie wondering when it was going to get good again"
1,really bad & not funny,"the only highlights of the film were when rebel wilson had lines, but she only had 3 minutes of screen time all-in-all."
1,did not like at all,"I thought this movie was going to be funny and hopefully entertaining... to me it was nothing but a bunch mean girls, Im not a prude and i do get insult humor . but to me these women were nothing but whinny jealous snotty mean bitches.. nothing else but that.. sorry I thought they were all very self indulged cry babies I did not like this movie even a little bit..."
1,Bachelorette,"No wonder this movie is playing at amazon as the same time as in theaters. It must have bombed at the box office,.Waist of time and money. The characters are just over the top crude and the story line is weak. First review I'm doing since I don't want others to waist their money or time.I'm wondering if the people who gave more then a star were paid off or friends of the producer. ...Usually liIke some of the actors but not even that could lift this bomb of a movie. Sorry,"
1,HORRIBLE!,"Don't waste your time. This is a movie that thinks if you show girls doing coke it'll be edgy. and edgy always equals funny, doesn't it?"
1,Do not watch!,I read a few reviews that said this movie was funnier than Bridesmaids. It was not funny at all. The characters were unrealistic & rude & there was a ton of drug use that didn't even seem to go along with the movie. It totally sucked. Really disappointing since I thought the actress Rebel Wilson was a really funny girl.
1,Not particularly funny or interesting,I get not having likeable characters. And freeing women characters up to be just whoever they are. Props for doing that in a wedding movie. But the characters had that sparingly intermittent and unsatisfying flashes of depth thing that makes it hard to watch the movie or believe in or gleen anyone's motivation. It also makes the jokes seem flat. It's not really any worse than most wedding movies. It's a little more grating than most though.
1,I see why this wasn't released in the theatre,Ridiculously bad movie. They tried to capitalize on the Hangover/Bridesmaid craze that struck our vapid society that past couple of years... but did not even come close to the aforementioned movies charm nor wit. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.
1,Boring,"The plot is so typical. There are barely any truly hilarious scenes. Kristen Dunst plays this awful person, Isla Fisher and Lizzy Caplan are drug addicts, and Rebel Wilson isn't even funny. It's an awkward and boring coming of age story."
3,Boring,"I was so excited to see this, but it was so boring and predictable, I could not even watch it till the end.It was a much cheaper version from Bridesmaids, not funny, sorry!"
3,Ehh,"Not a very good movie, should have known by the fact that it was being rented out while still in theaters. There were a few funny parts but all in all this was a pretty dissapointing movie."
3,Predictable,Predictable but funny. A great go to movie of you just want to laugh without needing to focus on a plot.
4,good time,Enjoyed this movie everytime i watched it. The characters were crazy enough to love and presented realistically. Everyone i watched it with got a kick out of it. Great movie!
3,Funny. But not hilarious,Funny movie but gets really serious and kills the laughter half way through. Was hoping for more comedy . It had promise but I would go to theaters for it
4,Wildlly personal,"From start to finish this movie is shocking, impulsive, and transparent, revealing what we all might do or want to do if we just let loose with raw reactions most don't dare express. So, take a few hours watch, laugh, and enjoy vicariously. These girls are friends and very funny. This is a daring movie that will stir your thoughts and emotions."
1,Wannabe Brides Maids,This move attempted to cash in on the popularity of Brides Maid. The writing and acting were average. I feel this movie portrayed women in a very negative light.
3,Not the kind of Friends Id want,"It was alright, funny at times, would have liked more of Rumor Willis character, less of Kirsten Dunst's character. These 4 people are supposed to be friends, I don't see it, even when they were back in high school. I thought with this cast it would be really amazing, I was disappointed."
1,This movie was terrible,"I had to turn it off. I just can't find it funny, women aren't like this --- it's just not funny. Great cast, horrible film"
2,Not worth it,These was no what we expected. It was not very funny and the plot didn't make sense most of the time. It was a waste of money and time to watch it.
1,So Bad,"This movie is so bad there are no words to describe it. 2 hours of my life I will never get back. I watched this because Rebel Wilson is so funny...but unfortunately the funny one wasn't even featured in this bad, bad movie."
3,"Funny, but not what I was hoping for","Perhaps I'm spoiled by The Hangover. Perhaps I'm spoiled from Bridesmaids. I was expecting more from this movie. Kirsten Dunst is well cast, but the bride is at her best when she plays comedic roles. She seemed miscast and it felt off. I feel the movie tried too hard to be like others that are so well regarded that it lost originality. It still had some great parts, but not consistently."
2,"Totally disappointing, not worth the rental fees","Great actors, good premise, but it just wasn't that funny... most of the jokes were a big miss. I loved Bridesmaids and the Hangover... so I am a fan of these kinds of movies.. but this one was very disappointing.. it was not worth the $6.99 rental fee."
2,Basically sucked.,"Think ""Mean Girls"" like 20 years later. Only this one wasn't as good. I found it extremely painful to sit through."
2,Disappointing,"I just watched this and have to say I was disappointed. I have wanted to see this for awhile but kept putting it off because of the negative reviews. I finally watched it and its not funny, there is no real plot, like others have said, it's just 3 mean, slutty girls who do a lot of coke. Bummer! Really wanted to like it."
2,Sad NOT that funny,A story about pathetic and desperate women who are beautiful yet totally unsatisfied. More sad than funny. Not very good.
5,"All those ""1 stars"" can have a frowny face pancake!","This movie was ridiculously entertaining and fast paced. This movie's brand of comedy may offend some with an unfit comedic heart (hence the polarity of the reviews). All of you ""1 stars"" can just chow down on your frowny face pancake because the world is an a-hole (eewe, he's mean). Peace!"
2,less than ok,"The show is ok if you have nothing else to do. It had a few funny parts but you basically see them all on the previews, the story line is not that great"
3,Bachelorette (2012),"Surprisingly disappointing.Is this the Bridesmaids sequel they planned without Kristen Wiig?I was a fan of the 2011 film, Bridesmaids, it was smart/funny/clever/ect, but this one was just...not great. I liked the cast they chose for this one, I've enjoy all of them in all of the different roles. If you say not to compare this to Bridesmaids, how can you not? It's very similar, the maid of honor screwing up the bride-to-be's big day and whatnot and getting into a fight with the bride. Anyways, I don't think I would go watch this in the theater, I'd wait till Redbox gets it.C-"
1,THIS DESERVES AN RAZZIE AWARD,"This was one of the worst moves i have watched. terrible plot, terrible script, terrible charactors. i feel sorry for ms dundst and fisher for being in this loser. dont waste your time."
2,meh,"all the funny bits are in the trailer. The story was way watered down and wasn't really interesting. They tried to make a more racy ""Bridsmaids"" but failed bad."
4,Raw Comedy,"This is a very funny movie, definately raw comedy at its best. This movie is one that happens all the time in real life. True story :-)"
5,Hilarious,I freaking loved this movie. My girlfriends and I laughed our heads off. Thumbs up funny freaking movie. Every character was hilarious.
2,Great actresses poorly done story,I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. It wasn't that it was just over the top or anything. There were only two characters I actually liked and the rest I couldn't stand. I don't understand why it's appealing to have three of the main characters talking bad about the bride and even calling her pig the night before her wedding. What's the point?
3,Just ok,I prefer when Kirsten Dunst plays a likable character. Somewhat predictable. I laughed a little. Certainly Bridesmaids was a better movie.
1,Awful Movie. Trailer is the best thing about it.,"A total waste of time and money on this movie, please don't waste yours. Trailer has any and all funny parts of movie in it. Not funny at all and it just throws language and crudeness around throughout the movie to try and get laughs. It should be in direct to DVD soon and even then it should not be purchased."
2,If you're a...,"narcissistic 20-30 year old who dreams obsessively about her ""big day"" then this is the movie for you! I have rarely seen a good movie about pre-wedding shenanigans but I enjoy so many of the cast members I thought I'd give it a shot. What a waste of $10! My synopsis: ""Coked up, insensitive, mean girls ruin lifelong friend's rehersal dinner and then tramp around NYC trying to get laid and more coked up all under the pretense of getting their ""friend's"" wedding dress fixed (that they tore while mocking her size). In the end the selfish girls find boyfriends, get the dress fixed at the 11th hour and are forgiven by the kind, fat bride."" I didn't care at all about these horrible, selfish characters. I'm a liberal person but constant use of the word ""retard"", glorification of cocaine use, mockery of overweight people, and celebration of cruelty and selfishness left me absolutely cold. What did I miss? I don't get all the five start reviews at all."
2,Sad attempt at capitalizing on Bridesmaids ferver...,"Really a BORING slow, tedious, randomly funny attempt at Bridesmaids type movie. FAIL.The actors are all so good, and it had potential, but it was just really lame. 1:24 felt like 3 hours!If you are high, it might be better."
1,Not worth the watch,Poorly acted. I love Rebel Wilson and I rented this movie for that exact reason-but it was a disappointment. Movie not recommended.
2,Booooring,"This was a random choice for me, nothing else was really on and I wanted a comedy. I love indie comedies, dark or not but this was just boring. More depressing than anything."
2,Not what I expected,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked really funny. Unfortunately any funny parts are overshadowed by the depressing lives of the best friends. Rebel Wilson is disappointing under used. This no BRIDESMAIDS."
1,Yuk,Glad I did not pay to see this at the movies... Purchased this to watch with the wife and regretted it...
1,Bachelorette is awful,This movie is awful. It's not funny; it's depressing and demoralizing. Spend your money to rent Bridesmaids again if you want a good wedding themed laugh.
3,Not as good as I thought,"was not as good as I thought I thought it was a little boring at times, the trailer was much better"
1,Waste of money and life,Really a pointless straight to DVD movie. A lot of the stuff just really doesn't make sense. Ugh. Should have rented BRIDESMAIDS
2,Disappointing,Did not think it was all that great. I thought the previews was better than the movie. Not all as it was hyped out to be.
4,Funny,This movie was pretty funny but I thought that they could have made it way funnier. I would compare it to Bridesmaids. Great chick flick!! I would watch it again.
3,This is more painful to watch than funny,"I was hoping for something funny, but there were more just painful laughing than there was actual funny scenes. I thought the movie was well done, but I could not help but think how self absorbed they all were. I cringed a lot during the movie and it was not at all lighthearted."
4,I thought it was pretty funny....,"I actually really enjoyed watching this movie. I read several negative reviews before watching, but I decided to watch anyways. First off, this movie is filled with sex, drugs, and horrible language. Don't be alarmed by its bad language or bad behavior. It is definitely an adult movie, with adult humor. But it is surprisingly funny. The storyline is similar to movies such as the Hangover or Bridesmaids, but it definitely shines in its own way."
5,Fram air filter CA8970,This item was exactly what I ordered. It was delivered on time and with no damage. This air filter was almost one-half the price from any store that I could find. I would recommend this site and would order from it again.
3,Smakee... You are no longer the only one!,"I grabbed this book off the shelf at the library on a whim, which I otherwise never do, but I was unprepared for my library visit. I very much enjoy epics & family sagas and this was one, so home with me it went. Halfway through I found myself getting bored. The plot was good, but the character development just wasn't there. I didn't really care what happened to anyone. Out of curiosity I looked up the reviews here to see if I should both finishing. When I read Smakee's review I felt it said everything I would have said. Except that Smakee didn't finish the book, which is too bad. The last 25% of this book really pulls it all together and it takes off! I was amazed, and glad I finished. 3 stars because it is a good book. 4 stars for me are extra special books, and 5 stars, well- not often do they come around.It's good, but you'll have to read it until the end in order to think so!"
5,Wonderful toy,"My 15-month-old son loves this toy, it is durable, yet detailed unlike many of the toys for his age. He loves to take the cow in and out of the tractor and ""drive"" it all around the house. All playmobil toys are great, but if you are going for durability, Playmobil 1.2.3 is the way to go!"
3,Beat's Book Helps with Hegel,"This is an introduction to an increasingly ""hot topic"" among academics and art types: how much modern art history owes to the philosopher Georg Hegel and his ideas. This is a second edition of the author's work and she admits that she's changed a few of her ideas. The monograph is a good beginner book on Hegel's art history, but assumes a basic knowledge of his works. Art history students will find it an easy read (easier than most other Hegel commentaries, that is), but still requiring concentration. Her explanation of Hegel's ""three periods of art"" could have been a little less coy, but readers wanting a more straightforward account of the lectures (from which this is culled) can look up Karsten Harries or the Hegel entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Wish it didn't cost $60, but it's the kind of book art historians, philosophy students and even collectors will refer to from time to time."
5,Learning through stories,"I had to read this book for a Media Ethics class and I must say that it was one of my favourite books! Salant teaches readers about the workings of a newsroom and the struggle to do what is right with the news through funny annecdotes and interesting stories. Any aspiring journalist MUST read this, and anyone just looking for a good biography would do well to read this. (Actually, EVERYONE should read this as journalism and the media are a strong presence in all our lives, and this is a fun way to learn more about it.)"
2,Not very good.,"Maybe it's just me and my own sense of humor, and seriousness, but I wasn't amused by these stories at all. Bursting out with laughter? No. And the artwork is awful. I'm a fan of the ElfQuest series all the way up to Kings of the Broken Wheel, and the change from beautiful, symmetrical elves to ugly, lopsided weak characters was shocking. There's a lot of fanart out there that's better than this! And the dialogue was flat and simple.If you're a really diehard fan of EQ, stay away. If you like the series, but can accept the art, boring stories, and all, then go and read it. I hope the artists that drew this get better. I don't think I could take it if they started doing the main stories."
5,Charmed- The Complete Sixth Season,"Got it from Amazon of course, great price, fast shipping. My daughter loves the series and is collecting them all. This is maybe the best of them all so far."
5,Charmed Rules,I love charmed so there will be no bad rating from me. I just can't wait to buy all of them!
5,the best,"this season as always was excelent. so sad it's over, but with the dvd's they can live forever."
1,The worst of all,"After watching season six, I felt Charmed should of been cancelled. Season seven was a little better and the final season was pretty good. Chris was the worst thing that happened to the show. The writing was bad. I dont think the writers had a clue which direction to go. They decided to make Chris Piper and Leos son midstream, due to Holly becoming pregnant in real life. The only thing that made Charmed good after Prues death was Cole, and when he left the show, it really got weak."
4,"Great show, but another set that I won't buy...","I WOULD have purchased all of the seasons on DVD, except for the fact that they just don't include any extras. I've SEEN all the episodes, so there is no reason to watch them again.For those who HAVEN'T seen the episodes, I highly recommend ALL seasons of Charmed. The cast has been outstanding (except for the boring Holly Marie Combs). I loved Shannen Doherty AND Rose McGowan AND Kelly Cuoco."
5,"""CHarming"" set of episodes","Even though the 6th season wasn't my fav, just getting close to completeing this set is awesome. The qualitry and diversity of the DVD's make for great 'chick' nights with your friends/family. If you are a Charmed fan, definitely go for this one!"
5,charmed dvd's,we love the dvd set! it came in the mail quick and my daughter has watched them 3 or 4 times!!
5,A Life changing time for them all,I got the sixth season of charmed yesterday two days before the actual arrival date in great condition in the mail and by far its a favorite of my season where piper is a motorcycle chick with the amazon warriors in the beginning then going through everything remembering everything as well in which isnt good for her sisters Phoebe & Paige i just cant wait to get the last two seasons then i ll own seasons 1-8 thanks to Amazon!! You guys are just awesome!!
4,Charmed Good or Bad,"Okay I am a Huge Charmed fan but I have heard many things about this season heres alittle of the Bad""Chris is the worst thing that happened to Charmed""""Without Cole and Prue the show is crap""""This season is the Worst Ever""Here is some of the good""Chris isnt bad in fact he made the show interesting""""The Season started strong and ended strong""""The Series really gets good with this season""Now I have only seen like 11 episodes of this season so if its as bad as they say it is i guess i saw the good half but since i havent seen all of it i cant make a decision"
3,Is this season over with yet,"This season though overall good...leaves the fans of charmed wondering what are the writers and producers and the ""gods that be"" thinking....the biggest problem is that: ""it is obvious (and continues through-out the rest of the seasons even to the grand finally) that Shannen Doherty is not only missing in body but in spirit with a lot of anger and ""what really happened"" behind the scenes still going on. The only redeeming factor in this season is Paige's development which finally finds some substance while the others figure out what they are going to do. Chris is a nice addition, but for those of us who have watched this character develop over the whole series....they took way to much time developing this character....many many episodes too too long.....the bottom line..you buy this season to complete the set and watch it when you want a good night's sleep in your easy chair or on the couch...."
4,love it,"I loved charmed, and this episode is great with Chris being born. I missed it on TV so it was nice sitting and watching all new shows. Now for the next season :-)"
5,Charmed Season Six purchase review,"This arrived sooner than I expected. The box cover, the jewel dvd cases and the disks were in great shape. Thanks :)"
4,a tough one,"I had a surprisingly tough time paying attention to this season... first of all, from my memory Chris' mission really turned to soup because he just kept repeating himself. Watching this a few times, reminded me of that annoyance.Besides my dislike for Chris and some episodes I found completely useless such as ""spin city"" - man I hate that one!It has its high points... I love Rose McGowans hair color during this season! It really matched her complextion - so when she was a brunette suddenly.. That was hard to get used to! But besides hair, everyones acting is superb, especially Brian Krause - he was really shining the last few years...I say go for it because its worth it if you want to understand the season or you're just a fanatic. Likewise, its good."
5,Charmed 6th Season,"Another great year! good effects, imagination, plot lines. Love these ladies and their powers."
5,CHARMED FOREVER,"I can't say enough about Charmed! I am addicted to Charmed. I can watch repeats of Charmed over and over and over again, and I have!"
2,"well, ..............","Well, I watched this & have to say it wan't that impressive. I was expecting it to glorify God a lot more than it did, and all but 1 person that they interviewed seemed kinda, I don't know, unemotional. They should have been jumping up & down, but they all kinda just sat there, talking. I think the biggest problem w/ this movie was they kinda made it seem that PEOPLE were being glorified instead of our Lord. Dannion Brinkley has been on another movie I saw once telling about his experiences, I find his account very fascinating. I really didn't care too much for this particular movie, sorry."
5,Stargazer brings Navajo history into the present.,"Laura Baker weaves a tale of heartache, history, mysticism and love as she tells the story of Lonewolf, a Navajoy stargazer, and Willow Becenti, a woman who believes in the future, not looking into the past. When I discovered Laura Baker I stumbled upon an author who can tell a story that keeps me spellbound from the first page to the last. I'm anxiously awaiting her third book this fall!"
3,Time traveling love story,"Stargazer was a time traveling love story that I had trouble getting into at first. I don't like when there are a few words/phrases in a different language because I just skip those and feel like I'm missing out on the story. I found a glossary for said words/phrases at the end of the book, however had I known about that glossary I still would have skipped over them. The fact that the phrases/words were in the Warrior's language did not make the tone of the book better for me. Perhaps the author could have put the English version in paren right after the Warrior language? Just a thought. Anyhow....the book involved mystery, love, a man with barely any clothes, some sweet love scenes (no sultry language but enough description to create it in your mind:) ), and after about 50 pages became a fast read....I'm just not sure some people would get that far."
5,Music at its best!,"Jan Hammer is undoubtly mos famous for his Miami Vice music, but ""Beyond The Mind's Eye"" would probably been as succesful, if it were promoted better. The Creme de la Creme on this wonderful CD are ""Seeds"", ""Magic Theater"", ""Brave New World"" and ""Midnight"" This is a MUST buy!"
5,Agreed...A MUST HAVE CLASSIC!,THis record is mandatory listening to musician and afficionado's alike. Barretto said this album was the first band in which he had all Puerto Rican musicians...I guarantee that you will be listening to this album over and over again!
1,Horrible !!!!,The company sent me two DVDs that were not compatible to USA DVD players ... So I had to ship it back which cost more than the DVD itself and I was NOT reimbursed for it!
4,A little Rain in your life is a good thing,"The 5th in the series involving John Rain was my first read about this character and by this author. I was not charmed by jumping back and forth from first person chapters to third person, but it is something you can live with. The story is a pretty straight forward one with Rain having to deal with the knowledge that he has fathered a child with a woman whose father he assassinated. She has to deal with it also.While doing that he is drawn into the assassination business at which he seems to have no peer and also has some very solid support.It is an interesting read, however it did not encourage me to read the earlier novels. The story is about relationships of all kinds. The kinds that end in death; the kind that have heart break attached to them and the kind where the people really needed killing.At that John Rain excells. Other aspects of his life need work."
3,A little too cute,"This one is completely out of character from its predecessors. Rain was the cold professional. Now he's constantly screwing up. I know that's the point of this story, but it goes too far, and each screw-up conveniently comes at the worst possible time. No navel-gazing while on an international flight or in the hotel room for this book. All the inattention has to come when going face to face with a bad guy or planning the caper. Too convenient."
2,disappointing,"I like the John Rain series, but having built up two really credible opponents (the guy who makes Rain's fight or flight reflex ""sing"" in an earlier book, and Yamaoto), they get finished off in ways that seem to avoid a simple one-on-one confrontation with both sides at their peak. What the point of building up Yamaoto as possessing martial arts skills on a par with Rain's if you're just going to shoot him from a mile away and then finish him off in hospital?"
1,Not Nearly As Good As Prior Books In Series,"I've enjoyed the prior books in this series. However, I found this one plodding, and too wrapped up in emotional melodrama and inner conflicts. While I've eagerly and quickly read through prior books, I've noticed that this one was an effort to finish. Everyone has their own preferences, but less introspection and more action in the next book would be welcome."
3,"the ""lost"" assassin","Several other reviewers have touched on it - this John Rain book is just not as much fun. Author Barry Eisler bogs the story down so with so much emotional melodrama that the appeal of the series is lost. What is that appeal? It's the dry, tactical way in which John Rain goes about his business. It's fun to watch him plan out an op in professional style and then roll smoothly with the punches when things go belly up. There's not nearly enough of that here with the exception of one big set piece near the end, and even that is too short.Instead we spend a lot of time jumping into the heads of the women in Rain's life (which is jarring), sorting out a love triangle, and sitting by the hospital bed of Rain's best friend, who is dying. Writing melodrama is not Eisler's strength. Realistic action is. Hopefully the next book in the series will give us less of the former and more of the latter. Let's stick with John Rain and watch him work. That would be fun."
5,Barry Eisler Slays 'Em Again,"In the latest John Rain thriller by Barry Eisler, the story starts fast, takes more twists and turns than a rollercoaster, and rockets to a finish that puts the ""thrill"" in thriller. Best of the series, and that's saying a lot."
2,Buy another book,"Buy Field's book Discovering Statistics with SPSS. It is much easier to follow and gives more indepth, discussions."
1,Nostalgic Pretentious Babble,"I disliked this book enough to take time to say so. The style of writing is difficult, circuitous, repetitive, and wordy. It is full of generalizations and citations from other authors and is lopsided in its thesis that all good things come from hunter/gatherers. It is nostalgic babble about a time long gone, from which we continue to evolve. There is no going back. No pragmatic solutions are offered for improving our present day predicaments, such as over population, aggressive behavior and overcrowding. This book seems to me to be an academic treatise with sophomoric overtones, trying to sound more profound than it really is. In all fairness some of the problem may be that the book is a posthumous publication."
2,Flawed Design,"The overall construction quality is good but the watch pillows sit very loosely in each compartment. If you were to move the box any watches could hit the glass top or potentially one-another. Returned it because of this design flaw.I have since purchased the Wolf Designs Men's Brown Four Piece Pocket Watch Case #450651. It is only limited to four dedicated watch spaces but includes room for various other items such as 3 pens, cufflinks, rings, chains or even a smaller watch or two. It is well made (the clasp could be a bit more robust and the case could have been made thinner) and with several recent price drops is a much better deal. The only limitation is the four dedicated spaces and your watches need to lie relatively flat."
4,She is Beautiful,"The other reviewer is correct in her assessment. This is an attractive doll. Her hair is great. She's very angely if I may make up an adjective. She is beautifully packaged I collect Barbies so I have not taken her from the packaging, but I have peaked at her feet. I wanted to see what they put on her feet. I was hoping she'd have on slippers or sandals. The doll is actually barefoot, which is fine, but she does not have any toes (no lines to mark toes) from what I can see. This is my first collectible without shoes, so I don't know if that's common or not. I've given her a 4 because of the lack of shoes and in my collection she falls in the middle. She's great for a pink label though."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I'll keep it short and sweet. Right out of the box, the wiring harness was not connected. The clip on the wires was not attached so we couldn't connect the mirror wires to the table wires. We tried to manually wire it and it still didn't work. It's an expensive piece of junk. I would recommend buying a plain vanity without useless electronics."
3,Not Ariels REAL voice,"My 4 year old was dying to have this for Christmas. Her grandfather got it for her and she was estatic! She loves the toy but was very disappointed when she realized it is not Ariel's voice. Its got the Disney name all over it so you would think they would've taken the time to at least find somebody who's voice resembles Ariel! Other than that, she likes it, although she has a hard time getting it to understand her even though she speaks better than most adults! It can be quite annoying to adults because it says the same things over and over and over!"
4,Happy with product,"I was happy with this product. It came promptly, and nothing was damaged, Easy to order and track. Overall good experience. My daughter loved the vanity!"
2,Over priced,"Fun, good idea but very overpriced! Also this product requires AA batteries, which died within the 1st hour. You need a screw driver to replace."
2,Cheap,"I'll start with the fact that my daughters love it. But it is a piece of junk. The faucet didn't work, my handy husband altered it to make it work. Then the hair dryer stopped working. It turns off really fast after 1-2 minutes, it's annoying because she'll be brushing her hair and have to restart the whole thing, battery waster. The drawer doesn't go in easily either. All in all a really expensive piece of junk, that could have been awesome."
4,Perfect for a toddler,This shipped on time. We bought it for my 3 year old daughter and she really enjoys playing with it but it's my 1 year old son that truly loves playing with it! Good for the price.
5,GREAT LITTLE VANITY FOR PRINCESSES - BUT MUST HAVE THE ADDITIONAL INTERACTIVE ACCESSORIES,"This vanity is so adorable but it is so much better with the additional interactive ariel salon accessories that are sold separately. I could only find them here on Amazon but it brings this toy from a 3 star to a 5 star rating. My nieces have so much fun with this,and they are always playing with it whenever I am over there. I was glad I found the accessories on Amazon or it wouldn't be nearly as awesome of a gift."
2,Kinda disappointing,"My daughter potty trained herself after we ordered this online. The first table was defective, so was the second. But the third is still okay and working. Repacking and returning to Amazon and Target was ok but not fun. The box shows an option for another beauty set that interacts but we can't find it- there are drawbacks but all in all she still likes it and I am now a pro at putting it together! I was sad it was not too durable and does not have Ariel's voice but an imposter. Oh well. She is still potty trained and it did work. There is another vanity (princess type that is better and yet one more now with a keyboard. Be prepared to return, in which case I'd go with a Target order."
5,Hollywood Gray style,"What a wonderful book, with amazing, original and creative photos. Great reference for students too!!"
2,Not Wholly Satisfactory,"The omissions of important directors like Kubrick (who was alive at the time) and Spielberg are too obvious since Gray went to the trouble to include pop-horror icons like Roger Corman and Wes Craven. Sure, we want an eclectic mix but come on! Another irritant is that some photos try too hard to be ""artsy,"" so much so that we can't even see their darn faces! What's the point of including a photo then? Besides these factors, the book is one of those cheap ""printed-on"" hardcovers, with no dust jacket. I suppose there are interesting anecdotes to be had but so far -- a terrible first impression."
4,Actually works well!,"This will actually get grease, dirt, and gunk out of my car carpet. Kudos to Blue Magic for making a carpet cleaner than actually works for once. I have used other stuff in the past this is the only one that actually works!!!"
2,nothing great,After reading all of the reviews on here I thought this was a must have product to get the carpet cleaned in a few spots so i could get my security deposit back from my landlord. Guess what first thing he said when he came in well guess we have to get the carpet cleaned to get these spots out so the product made them maybe 1 shade lighter but the stains still where there.
5,Made our old Suede chairs look Brand New!,"I Really love this spray, we have six chairs in our office' conference room about 8 years old, we have been trying to get out the old stains with different stuff, nothing worked, This Blue Magic was really ""Magic"" we just sprayed and wiped and ""Everything"" Came off *WOW* I already Recommended this item to my friends! Buy it - You will love it!"
3,not bad,It works OK. I have had better luck with store bought brands. Itprobably depends on the stain. Pet stains are the worst and theremoval is only fair. I was hoping for total success and did not get it.
2,Did not work,I used it on a 3 day old dried hand-soap stain that had been washed with water. The stain is still prominently visible after many applications.
1,product that sucks,"I had a coffee stain on my carpet in my living room and grease on my car's carpet inside the trunk.I bought this item after I read the positive reviews,used as directed and stains are still there,worst part I can't return this item back to amazon,they will not take it back for safety reasons. (flammable liquid)."
4,"Skepticism Proved Unfounded, Removes Stains Well!","--BlueMagic 900 Stain Lifter--PROS: I was skeptical of any product like this, but BlueMagic proved itself a quality stain remover. Like other reviewers have said, it truly does work, and work well. I spilled orange soda in my car and this stain remover took it virtually all out, even days later. I'm impressed that you can instantly see the stain come up on your cloth.CONS: like any stain remover, it won't perform miracles to the extent of removing age-old, badly-worn-in stains. But it comes pretty close! Be prepared to use a lot of elbow greese and repeated treatments for difficult stains to come out. The bottle is a big ole' beast that won't fit into a car's glove compartment--be prepared to keep this in your trunk if you hope to carry it in the car.BOTTON LINE: well done, BlueMagic!"
5,Has not met its match!,So far this stuff has tackled red clay and various doggie excrements on light colored carpeting no problem. It even lightened an old coffe stain. Would definitely buy again.
2,I tried this on my dogs pee stain,My dog stained my carpet with pee stain. So I purchased this seeing all the good reviews. It didn't really work out for me.
5,Better than Steam Cleaning!,"It's amazing how dirty and stained your carpet can get! I didn't know what I was going to do with the carpet in the room where my son plays! I thought it was going to be time to replace it. We have used steam cleaners, professional cleaners, etc. and they either failed or the stains came back through. This stuff works! On hold and new stains. My ONLY complaint is the stuff stinks to the high heavens! So when you're done cleaning you need to air the room out and spray an air freshener or sprinkle a carpet de-oderizer down to take out the smell of the cleaner. Also, the directions say no need to vacuum, but you really need to after the carpet dries."
3,It's ok,"This product only removes the light or not so stubborn stains. I have some old stains of oily Indian curry, I had hoped that this cleaner would take care of them but I was wrong.This is good for light stains.Another problem is that, it doesnt last long, I used for about 4-5 times (each time on about 5 stains - 1 inch diameter approx) and it got over."
3,Average carpet cleaner,"I had a stain to remove consisting of crystal lite, unfortunately, red, and the product didn't even touch the stain. Hopefully it would work on other stains."
2,doesn't work on tea,"took forever to arrive and when it did it let us down. Did nothing for a tea stain on a cream carpet. not even lighten it. might be good for other things though, who knows"
2,it didn't work,"it didn't work for me.I just used on regular stains on carpets, I brushed and ran dyson vacuum cleaner over it...didn't work."
5,Very Effective,"* The below review has been given by my wife *I got this product after reading the positive reviews about the same. This Blue Magic Carpet Stain & Spot Lifter delivers as promised. It has to be sprayed on the area of carpet where the stains have to be removed. After 5 minutes of spraying, it starts working. The stain can then be blotted out with a paper towel or clean cloth. This product has removed the stains on my carpet considerably well. Very effective product."
5,Turkey grease not a problem :-),"This stuff is great, spray the stain heavily, wait 30 seconds, blot it out. Got rid of some 6 month old brown turkey grease on my backseat from when I had to bring the bird to the office for Thanksgiving. I needed A LOT of paper towels to blot out the turkey grease, but I'm quite happy with the results."
1,might as well spray water,"does not lift stans, all it does it provide a wet medium , you can just spray some water on your carpet and will get the same effect, also btw it stinks up the place !"
3,magic as I supposed?,"For one particular stain left on the carpet in my living room before I moved in, I tried to get rid of it. That is why I tried this product after I have tried several other ways, but after applied BlueMagic more than 4 time, the stain is still there. Just wonder is there any other way I should try?"
5,Love blue magic,I absolutely love blue magic carpet stain and spot lifter. We had some old dog stains on our carpet that nothing else would get out. We had tried everything. One day I saw this and thought oh well I'll try something else. We were thinking we were going to have to get new carpet. It took them out!! They have not reappeared as it did all the other times. I did scrub with a little brush on the stains and then blotted. WOW! I won't use anything else any more. I would recommend this for new and old stains.
3,Works on dirt...not so great on stains,Bought this product to remove a red stain on my beige carpet. Tried it 4 times as directed on the can and it did not work very well. Stain is still very noticeable. I tried this product on the entryway and it removed the black dirt marks.I will try another product and hopefully the red stain comes out.
5,great product!,The best I've ever used for cleaning up cat vomit and coffee stains. I have a white carpet and this is the only carpet cleaner that doesn't leave spots.
1,Cans all came with no propellant,"I bought several cans of this carpet cleaner because it is so effective as a spot remover. However, every can from this batch was unusable due to no propellant. ERGO the can is full but will not spray.... so useless. Not the problem of the manufacturer but whoever distributed this, should be sued. I didn't realize this affected the entire shipment until months after I bought them so I did not have the chance to return."
1,typical new age fuzzy-tingles,"Listening to this CD certianly does not make one feel as if they are in outerspace. Try a new age shop with crystals and warm fuzzies. Simply put, this music has no Power. Very whimpy garabage."
5,Great Stapler,"I purchased the SLS 18 stapler to secure luan underlayment in my kitchen/breakfast room. I shot over 5000 staples without any jamming, double fires, etc. In short, the stapler worked perfectly. In addition, the soft feel of the hand grip is very comfortable, although it is already showing signs of wear."
4,Could be better...,"I used this stapler quite a lot since if first got it and would recommend it for the price, but my only complaint that kept it from getting five starts would be that every now and then it misfires and just marks up the wood - happens the most with 1 1/2"" staples but has never happened with 3/4"" staples, I was using Senco staples too, but no jams though. Overall a good gun, nice case and good depth adjustment and consistency even in thin delicate material."
2,somewhat troublesome,"After using the SLS18 for a few years, I am finally giving up on it.The first thing to fail was the foam grip around the body of the gun. It tore and fell off of the gun after a few uses. Wrapping electrical tape around the grip doesn't exactly look professional.The next problem was the unit misfiring after every few shots. Personally, I think there is a design flaw in which the driver blade does not line up quite perfectly with the staple to be shot. This has been a frustrating and persistent nuisance. Technical support was quite pleasant to deal with, but has yet to deliver an effective solution.Now, the stapler has lost it's muscle. Even at 120psi feed, it struggles to drive even 1"" staples effectively.I am all about repairing tools, as I absolutely hate having to buy a tool twice, but one can only invest so much time and frustration and eventually it just isn't worth it.In summary, ""Should have bought the Hitachi"".... comes to mind again."
2,Hooks are too small,"Read reviews saying the hooks are too small, but disregarded because my pontoon has small eyelets. Ends up the hooks are too small, and will be for most pontoons. So plan on spending an additional $10 for a set of large hooks, to hook on to the standard set.KwikTek has not returned my call asking about the issue."
4,Kwik Tek Heavy Duty Harness,Haved used this all season with no problems and it serves its purpose. The kwik-connect and clips are definitely heavy duty. The float could be larger to ensure the ropes stay on top of the water. My other harness that has a roller to move from side to side and works better for tubing (we use this to wakeboard and ski).
1,"Very limited, useless and shallow book","There are not enough words to express how dissapointed I am about this book. It doesn't show even basic database features like how to show a one to many relationship in the same web page using list boxes or drop down lists! Many chapters simply repeat the same material: how to run the wizard to create a page that manages a single (underscore single) table record. The author has been ironic enough to show a multiple table database layout (ERD), and then not creating a single page that is able to manage more than one table! The only list boxes used are filled by hand, not dynamically from a database! Was the name of the book Dreamweaver and Databases?Save your money, go for the online help files in the macromedia web site. I got misled by the high ratings this book got here. Don't make the same mistake. Can I get my money back?"
4,Informative Book on Touring for the Cyclist,"This is a good book to get an overview of touring by bicycle. This book is published by the same publisher who published Trudy Bell's The Essential Bicycle Communter, which is unfortnately out of print and should be a canidate for updating.The Essential Touring Cyclist has been fortunately been updated and kept in print. I found the information useful. Maybe this is not the right book for an experienced touring cyclist, as some other reviewers have mentioned. While this book gives an excellent overview and tips to prepare for a cycling adventure, it could have been a bit more detailed like Bell's book--why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
4,really helpful,"I just started this last night, I have road ridden on a mountain bike for years, on a bike that has been refit for me several times, this book is very helpful, I would like to ride more and this will help me try some different bikes. My local bike store is full of nice people,but since I am not a serious rider,and am a short heavy woman, they have little time to help me. this book fill that need."
4,raw and gritty,this is a really interesting album that leans more towards concept hiphop but it is good concept Hiphop. The production is mostly handled by OHNO but this is not a typical OHNO release it is different in that it is less like MADLIB stuff and more like OHNO is trying to do something new. LMNO has some great points to make as an MC and is very political and on point with his subject matter. I found myself saying WORD many times throughout this album if you like MANCHILD from MARSILL you will probably like LMNO. While every track is not great this is still one worth picking up.
5,Great ideas,"I like how the book has dozens of ideas. If you expect lots of detailed directions, don't. But that's ok with me. I know how to use software applications already, but feel like I'm trying to reinvent the wheel when integrating the computer into the classroom material. This book gave me many ideas.I use Windows machines at my school and the projects work great."
2,Not for Windows Users,"I teach computers in a lab setting to elementary students, and I found this book only mildly helpful. It gives general advice, but any detailed project descriptions used MAC applications such as Kidpix and Hyperstudio, and would be much more difficult in Windows."
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed in the size. It is much smaller than I thought it would be. Other than that it is cute
5,must have,"If you are a fan of curve or lush, this is a must have for you. If you can find it, buy it!"
2,Finally a disappointment,"A very absorbing story, but finally disappointing. The mumbo-jumbo never quite comes together, and the ""philosophy"" remains meaningless."
5,You want quality.,"Corelle is Cornell. To the older generation who always had that bowl that fell and would not break that's a Cornell..that name is now Corelle.. It can break, and when it does it splinters..It happens. This is a top of the line product made in the USA and the best made bowl out there. You need to drop a Corelle very far to break.Quality is sometimes simple.. Be open minded."
5,A Tribute,"It is an honour to have known Jeff and to know the author Douglas - this is a very moving and thought-provoking piece of reading to gain an insight into the life and love of this wonderful man and his partner Keith. It is a tribute to the lives of all the crew who died that day and to the battle for recognition that is still being fought. Keep the tissue handy. It will appeal to all, gay, straight, airline staff or not - a story that needed to be told and is done so with such compassion and grace. Neil - Australia"
5,Jeff's Way,"Good book, actually he was friend of mine since 1995. I still miss him. He always had a story to tell after his flights about who he met and how much he loved his job. My heart goes out to Keith and all the family members who lost loved ones that day!mike Konn"
3,NOT Satori.....,"expensive 2 disc set thats kind of a mixed bag: If you are expecting more ""Satori"" insanity,well you will be disappointed.Not to say this isnt decent(it has it's moments),but it's more psychedelic hard rock than the Eastern proto-metal Sabbath stylings found on the god-like ""Satori"" masterpiece.Disc two is the live stuff,and I find it by far the best material on this release."
5,A Piece of Crucial Industrial Musik,"Flock of Rotations is a fine example of what was originally classified as ""industrial music."" This album along with another called, ""Misfits, Loony Tunes and Squalid Criminals"" serve as an excellent introduction to Zoviet France (also listed as Soviet France). The music generally consists of a mesmerizing stream of sound and imagery that yield a modern-primitive atmosphere/soundscape that is both pleasant and captivating. These two works have long been overdue to be re-released on CD. First released on LP in the mid-eighties on Red Rhino Records (LP only). The second edition was available on CD in the mid 90s on Charrm (UK). There are other Zoviet France albums worth investigating but perhaps not without first owning ""Flock of Rotations"" and ""Misfits..."""
4,strangers marry,"This must have been one of the firsts of Kleypas' books. It wasn't bad, but I did think there were almost too many characters involved at one time. There was so much going on, you are trying not to lose what's going on between the main characters. It was enjoyable and her writing keeps getting better and better each book she writes. I wouldn't judge all her books by this one. If you like this one, anything else she wrote, you'll love ten times more."
3,The Original Is Still Better!,"OIYA has always been one of my favorite Kleypas books. I'm so disappointed that Lisa decided to rewrite/udpate and rename this classic. The story of Max and Lysette is compelling and sexy. The original title perfectly suited the story -- Max could only find love again with Lysette. WSM is downright silly -- the story is not that two strangers married but rather how they fell in love (only in each others arms!). Whether you buy OIYA or WSM, you won't be disappointed. This is Kleypas at her finest.Note to Lisa: Please don't change ""Only With Your Love""! Which, for all you newbies, is the follow-up to OIYA."
2,Don't waste your money!,"Go out and get the original, Only In Your Arms. This new updated version is a disappointing attempt to make these _historical_ characters more acceptable for the modern reader. What happens is just the opposite, Max and Lysette are much less compelling in this glossed over version than they were in Only In Your Arms. The author may not have been happy with her original effort but this is by no means an improvement. Is this an example of the type of characters we have to look forward to in historicals from now on? I hope not. What she did to Max in this updated version made me cringe."
4,Enjoyable,I enjoy reading different types of books and especially historical romances. This was a very enjoyable story because of not only the romantic plot but also the light mystery involved.
3,It was just ok...,"I have had this book on my shelf for some time, and have been putting off reading it because of the setting (New Orleans, early 1800's) is not one of my favorites. After I read this book I had mixed feelings, I liked the love story but not the age difference. And I skimmed a lot over the parts where Max was having meetings with people, I just couldn't bring myself to read them. I would only recommend this book to get to know the characters for the second one Only With Your Love, which I absolutely loved, it was so much better than the first!!!"
3,Not a bad read,"It wasn't the best Kleypas has done, but it wasn't a bad book either. I didn't have any trouble getting through the book without getting bored. I thought the plot was very interesting and I grew to like Lysette quite a bit. I'm not a big fan of the Creole way, but Kleypas did a great job researching that historical period of time.The thing that ticked me off was how the brother who did commit the two murders, gets away without even a fraction of what Max suffered all those years. At the end Bernard sneaks onto a boat and is handed money to help his escape and nothing more is said about it. I thought Kleypas should have written an Epilogue or something saying he was later captured and hanged...something. I'm not going to give anything else away but if you want the book, I suggest buy it used. Don't pay full price."
2,If It Ain't Broke........!!,"Don't fix it!!! Watered down version of the first book. Lysette our heroine now has more of a spine and our hero ,Max, is less tormented and everybody got along w/ each other. Blah, blah, blah, boring , boring, boring. The characters...the whole story is much less compelling. Very disappointed in L.K. I think she just got too lazy to create a new story from scratch. ..."
2,Not up to the normal standards of Kleypas...,"I normally love Kleypas's books and have given many of them 4 or 5 starts. But this one was just really not up to par. The whole marrying someone old enough to be your dad theme is not a turn on at all. There was also too much politics. And you really didn't understand why the H/H loved each other. Max saw Lysette and that was it, they will get together without knowing much about each other at all. I didn't even finish the book and just skimmed through to the end. If you really want to read this book, get it from the library, it's not worth spending $$ on."
4,When Strangers Marry,Is a very good book. The characters are memorable. The book is full of passion. It is a very heart warming story.
3,Ok but .................,"I have read many Lisa Kleypas novels and have loved every one of them. Except for this one. I thought the pace of the plot was slow and not deep enough. Too light. Maybe it was because the book was originally written over 10 years ago, but it is not like her newer books. I have not read the original of this book Only In Your Arms, and I dont think I will either. The characters were not real enough for me either. It was Ok really, I just think it could have been better considering how good her later books are in comparison with this one. I had no trouble reading it, the story flowed and the sex was OK. But once I was done reading the story, it just could have been way better. I just did not really notice until I was done and gathering my thoughts and formulating an opinion. Ok read, but I would go to the library. From now on, Im sticking to newer stories."
2,When Strangers Marry,"I would have hated to read the first version of this book. This re-written version was so boring that I read 10 pages at a time and dreaded picking it up again each time. Bernard was the only character with any real passion and he wasn't a pleasant person. Justin was somewhat interesting until he went soft halfway through the book. Lysette trying to pretend to be a parent to two boys that were almost the same age as her was very weird. For that matter I couldn't quite get it out of my head how young she was compared to Max. It was like he was having sex with a 12 year old. There was no passion or friction between the two at all. The romance part of this book was very, very boring. It would have been more fitting for Lysette to end up with one of the twins rather than Max. The end of the book was a great disappointment. What they did when the murderer was found out made me ill. I didn't enjoy this book at all."
3,A smoother but bleached storyline,"The re-interpretation of her classic romance Only in Your Arms attempts to accentuate the central heroine Lysette as erudite and resilient and reducing the darker tone of Max Vallerand as a wealthy Creole businessman haunted by the infidelity of his murdered former wife. In the process of embellishing with a more sensual tone, the novel has lost the simpler tenderness and magic that Lysette wields over the children. This tale of serendipitious romance in the bayous of Louisiana clearly gets improved in the area of narrative flair where Lisa Kleypas has smoothened the kinks - but otherwise the original is still our preferred choice."
2,Potentialy Good,"I love Lisa Klypas, but this one did not take my fancy. It had a great story line, BUT very drawn out. What normally takes me a day, 2 tops, to read it took me a month to get myself to finish this novel. My absolute FAV at this point is Blue-Eyed Devil! It had a realistic twist and kept me emotionaly involved with the characters. Which is what everyone should look for in every romance novel!"
1,Not my favorite,My least favorite of all 10 books Ive read by Lisa Kleypas. I think I would have enjoyed the original much more.
3,"Don't let the ""chrome"" finish fool you.","I just got this and was wildly dsappointed that it is chrome on top of plastic. While plastic is not inherently bad, on bathroom fixtres they feel cheap. but what was I expecting at this price? I have not yet installed it, and probably won't, so the jury is still out as far as performance. Amazon could have made a better description than calling it ""stainless steel"". It isnt. Then the returns ""reasons"" you can choose from are ridiculous. Most of them result in you paying for the shipping. There is not one that says ""we shipped you the wrong item"" or ""product does not match description and/or pics""."
3,Semper fit,"The exercises are great, but 30 minutes of it involve a circuit course and running outdoors. One cannot do those exercises indoors unless they had a huge back yard with a built in circuit course."
3,Small,"If I had known these were so small, I would not have gotten them. I am still happy because I love these designs though."
5,Portable PA,"This portable public address system is perfect for making announcements at our Music Collectors' Shows. It is not heavy to carry, easy to operate, and will work with batteries or a/c. (I bought this one to replace on that wore out with age!)"
5,Another Boston smash!,"Hi there,I'm always keen to keep abreast of the Boston music scene. I think it's been one of the most vibrant and progressive in the world - ever since the Pixies and Throwing Muses. How come I never heard of Eileen Rose then, when she's such an amazing songwriter and such a brilliant singer, and she's Bostonian? Well, seems she's lived in England for the last 10 years. That explains it. But, being as she sounds like a fabulous combination of PJ Harvey, Tom Waits, Kate Bush (and even Aerosmith!), I'd like to say this to the English . . . can we have her back now?"
1,Stopped working,"I purchased this controller and was immediately dissapointed. It was large and clunky (this is from a dude with large hands). The triggers are tooo sensitive, and not ideal for games which require a bit of tension with the springs. (See ESPN NBA BASKETBALL). I like the fact that the black and white buttons are shoulder buttons. But more than anything else I wouldnt suggest it because within a few weeks the controller started to freak out and then i suddenly died out on me.ProsBlack and white shoulder buttonsPriceConsBig and clunkyIt feels cheapSensitive L+R TriggersStopped working"
1,it is horrible,i have owned this controller for not even a week and it already broke. On halo2 to look down it takes so long.... i seriously recommend you to not buy it and invest your money in a microsoft brand controller. DON'T BUY!!!!!
1,Mix and Match is for very young kids,The box makes you think it has some fun games. Well if your 5 they would be. All the games are designed for little kids. Glad I only paid a buck.
1,nor worth the money,I thought this was too much money for a plastic toy that really does nothing. I am thinking about returning it.
5,Pain Relief!,"I've been suffering with sciatica for 3 years now and couldn't get through a day without pain meds. Since doing the exercises as described in the book, I have been able to reduce or eliminate (depending on the day) my use of pain medication. Awesome! It helped that I already knew exactly what was structurally wrong in my body: my pelvis is not only twisted but one side is higher than the other. This book addresses both of these conditions... and four others. My husband has poor upper back posture (slumped shoulders) and there are even a set of exercises for that. We commit 15 minutes each night to the exercises and it helps! It's not the miracle answer, but if you commit the time and energy, your pain will be reduced significantly."
4,A Rose By Any Other Name,"With a name like Human Television, you might think this Philly-by-way-of-Gainsville quartet sounds like the Human League or Television. But what's in a name anyway? On their debut EP, they sound more like REM--minus Michael Stipe's vocals--or the Wedding Present--minus (some of) the speed. If you like jangle: they're the band for you. At times, they even remind me of New Zealand's Chills, one of the best jangle bands of all time. That said, I think I prefer their harder-edged material to the soft. Here's hoping their first full-length has more songs like the driving ""Sick With Redundancy Check"" than poppy ""Saw You Walking By."""
4,Indie Pop that delivers in the catchy department,"These songs are really catchy. It takes me back to a lot of my favorite indie pop of the 80's and 90's. I hear early REM, The Feelies, The Barnabys, The Wedding Present, The Connells, The Bats, The Chills and other great bands when I hear this album, but Human Television really makes the sound their own at the same time. Jangly guitar is prevalent, but they also can rock. The vocals aren't very unique but are just sour enough to complement the poppiness of their songs perfectly."
5,very pleased,I was very pleased with the items I ordered from this company. I give them a 5 star review. Shipping cost was not outrageous and they delivered on time.In the future I plan to order from this company whenever I need any of their goods.
5,"Charmed is cool, but don't buy it as a pack","I'm a Charmed fan and I hate to say this but buying the Charmed Pack seson 1-6 for $274.99 is totally NOT worth it. WHY? Because if you buy each season 1-6 seperately, total will cost $210.80 (savings of $64.19). And if you add season 7, it will be a total of $243.28. That's still a big savings! So I suggest that you put each season one-by-one in your shopping cart if you want to save money. You save $31.71 if you buy season 1-7 and add it in your cart one-by-one."
5,Lighten Your Load!,"We just recently bought this handy dandy hauler and am I glad we did!I had a chance to use it right after it was put together to bring in a big load of groceries. It was cold, windy and rainy so this little cart was a big help. I saved myself from having to make repeated trips from the garage to the house (35 feet each way) with three gallons of milk, cartons of soda, canned goods and numerous other goodies by using this cart.Now having used it, I can foresee many other instances where it will come in handy. This is sure to be a back-saver for me! Regarding the height of the handle, I am 5'10"" and it was no problem for me. An added plus is that it can easily be folded down for storage. I like the idea of strapping on a laundry basket to keep items in plastic bags from sliding off as one reviewer suggested. Good idea! Thanks! ~ The Boss"
2,Utility Cart,"One of the wheel bolts was defective and would not unscrew. It was a Christmas present, so I chose not to return the item but had a friend saw off the bolt and fill the cavity with foam so it would not rattle. It was very poorly packed, so the bolt could have been damaged in shipping. I was very disappointed with the condition of the item when I received it, so I will likely not order anything further from Amazon."
2,it coulda been a contender,"Perfect size. Nice design. Pretty solid (for it's weight).But after the first use one of the bolts dropped out of the handle base --the nut had worked loose. Fortunately I found it and replaced it. But after two more uses, two more bolts worked loose and this time I couldn't find one of the nuts. The thing is now sitting in my garage.It's a shame that poor details like this can ruin what was otherwise a pefect little dolly."
5,Can't Live Without It,"The Handy Hauler is fantastic. I use if when gardening, moving heavy plants, fertilizer or pots. I used it to move all my orchids into a safe place when the hurricanes threaten. I had a home emergency and prior to work beginning we had to move everything from the house into the living room. I used the Handy Hauler and it made the tast so simple. It folds flat and opens easily. It is reasonably priced for a true work horse."
4,van still the man,"this is a good album, not great, i love van, he rules, better albums are veedon, astral, moondance, avalon, inarticulate etc.etc. he is the best singer ever i love this guy this has some great songs though forgot that love existed, motherless child, it deserves 4 stars i am a serious van a holic"
5,Poetic Champions Compose,"I had not bought a Van Morrison album in many years but one night my wife was watching one of her chic flicks, ""Bridget Jones Diary"" and I heard an awesome, soulfull love song in the film and it sounded like Van Morrison. I checked it out. The song was ""Someone Like You"" and I finally found a vinyl copy of the album and I listened to it probably four hours that night. The album never grows old. I'm 54 years old and I have an enormouse record collection spanning 5 decades. This album would be in my top 5. All songs on the album are wonderful, but my favourite is ""Queen of The Slipstream"". Anyone not moved by this album is not human."
5,This is the best of Van Morrison's work,"Van Morrison at his best. A beautiful, moody, thought-provoking CD with each song having its own distinct character. This is my favorite blues CD."
2,Disappointing,"This book is full of interesting and informative tidbits. But some of the language used really turned me off. Seeing post-op MTF transsexuals called ""women"" with quotation marks makes me see red. And after about the third occurrence of terms like ""pervert"" and ""sicko,"" I was more disgusted by the author than by the grossness being described."
3,It was okay...,"I like books like this, but it wasn't exactly what I had hoped for. I would've liked it more if the chapters could have had more on each topic (some topics only had maybe a half a page to the most on the subject), and maybe less wise-crack humor (some sounded like the author was trying too hard to make a joke). Other than that there were some things that i did find myself giggling about, and i also found some things quite fascinating and even a bit disgusting lol. All-in-all I'd give it 3 1/2 *'s."
3,Not all that great...,"Yes some of it was gross and interesting, but otherparts were just plain dumb. Not worth the money...borrow it from a friend."
5,The name says it all!!,"i recently just saw this title and was intreged by it.It is a short book, you can read it in a few hours, but it certainly stands up to its name.The topics are strange, yet, somehow they hit upon the questions that we all have about those strange and gross things that are out there.Certainly a conversation starter!!"
5,Looking for a fluffy homage to Barneys? Won't find it in this book.,"As someone who abhors the customer service at Barneys and yet still shops there (they do have the best selection!), I found this book incredibly fascinating. The history of the Pressman family and eventual downfall explains so much about the current version of the store. Regardless of whether you shop at Barneys or not, you will love this book if you are interested in the business side of fashion."
2,hmmmm,Thought it was new instead of a used library book I received I guess I could actually go to a library and check out myself...not happy!
4,Smaller than expected,"I got these to use as ""bad guys"" for when my sons are playing with their Army men. I thought they'd be around the same size as the little plastic army men, but they're much smaller. The description says that they're 2"" but I just measured them and they're exactly 1"". Maybe they were using a different ruler? Regardless, zombies are still all the rage these days so my boys still like them, but they just use them for other things."
5,Zombie Fun!,My son loves anything Zombie related so when we saw these Zombie guys - we had to get them! He plays for hours with them!
5,ZOMBIES,"Brains, WANT BRains! Yup, if you have heard these words before, no doubt you have battled zombies. I bought these to play with ZOMBIES the game. They are great where you need a number of different kinds of zombies to make the game interesting. They are plastic, and best of all cheap. Buy them. Give them as gifts and use your BRAINS..."
3,they are pretty small,"I was hoping they were same size as army men so kids could create battle but they are much smaller. No big deal, wish I had gotten the glow in the dark ones."
1,This was the worst horror movie I have ever seen in my life.,This was the worst horror movie I have ever seen in my life. I love horror movies. I have over 2000 in my collection. The story had such a great potential and was wasted on this director and his crew. The cast did their best with the worst director and crew ever. Sadly the movie should be redone with a real director and a crew that actually knows how to shoot a movie. This one is a waste of time and money!
3,Greystoen Park,"I just watched this movie last night, and what I enjoyed it. Three people decide to go into an abandoned asylum and record their experience. Let me start out by saying that asylums, for me, are some of the scariest places (on a side note, I would recommend the classic Session 9)in their depictions of abandonment and loneliness. This movie did excel in this area. The movie also excels in that it addresses the notion of fear that can come with visiting such a place. The ending did give me a shiver.Why three stars? The acting is not great, but bearable. However, the real problem is the shaky camera usage. I can usually handle the moving camera, but I nearly got a headache from watching the shaky camera movement. Also, the lighting at times is too dark to make anything out. My advice is rent this one and check it out for yourself."
3,TDI not covered,"Although announced on the cover of the book, these two books do not cover the complete TDI model. Chapters that cover the TDI are very usefull."
1,The CD version of this is terrible...,"While my version of this manual is the CD version, from Bentley, one assumes it is the same. I felt with the ability to search the CD and to enter the computer error codes directly into this, that it would be valuable, but it is close to unusable. The electronic information is just plain wrong. When I commented on a Bentley forum on this, there was a reply ""well that is the information that Volkswagon supplied us."" Which may be completely accurate, but is hardly helpful, nor does it justify the cost.Troubleshooting help will be non-existent.Electronic information will be both wrong and at times missing.What I, as an electrical engineer, call a wiring diagram, or even meta-wiring diagram, does not exist.If this is the guide that VW mechanics and dealers use, no wonder it costs so much for repairs, they have nothing to go on ..."
4,This band is brutal and just plain awesome,This cd is pretty awesome. The whold cd is just like a brutal story about prison. The theme of the cd is people getting put to death or on death row in prison. All of the lyrics wrote in the song are people that have been executed or still on death row. If if like Good death metal then u should really get this cd to have in your collection its pretty damn sweet plus i love how they have samples before some of the songs about The death penalty haha get this album Anasarca rocks~
1,Raised price $5 while looking at it!,"My wife showed me the item on her PC and when I went to my PC to order it after measuring our stairwell, the price went up $5. Obviously, we will not be buying it now. $34->$39"
1,poor product,"I PURCHASED ON OF THESE GATE TO SECTION OFF A ROOM FOR MY PUPPY. THESE GATES DO NOT STAY ADJUSTED. IF YOU DO GET THEM TO STAY THE GATE WON'T OPEN. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.REGRETING MY PURCHASE,J. WAY"
3,Good Deal,I just received this gate yesterday to contain my miniature schnauser. No problem installing and no problem opening gate with one hand.
4,Works Well,"I bought this to replace a wooden swing gate, I liked but needed to replace due to the wood warping,and plain old wear and tear. This is much more durable in that area.It works, but is more difficult to open and close, I usually need 2 hands to operate it, and don't always have 2 available.I would like it better if the gate swung close on its own (like my old wood style Gate), and had an easier latch system."
1,Gate did not fit 34 inch door opening (see details below),"Here's a word of warning to anyone who wants to use this gate: the online product details say that the gate fits 29 inches through 37.5, but the assembly instructions show that the gate without the extension fits 29 to 33.5 inches and with the extension fits 35 to 37.5 inches, thus there is an 1.5 inch gap (33.5 to 35 inches)that isn't covered.I tried to get it to fit my 34 inch door opening but the pressure points were restricted from unscrewing that far because it maxed out at 33.5 inches or maybe a little less. I tried using small blocks to narrow the area but that did not work well. This less than desirable workaround caused the gate to keep falling down, so I had to return it.My question is: why design a gate that has an 1.5 inch gap in coverage???"
2,Disappointment,"I bought this product for childproofing purposes. I was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer's instructions state not to install gate against drywall (which was not in the item description), so i cannot use it where i needed it. Also, the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close, especially with a small child in your arms."
5,This gate is great!!,I highly recommend this gate for dogs or even children. I purchased three of these for use with my new puppy and it was a great decision! They are very easy to set up and install and so convenient to use with the ability to open the gate and not have to step over it. Definately saves your walls too!
4,The best gate system!,Easy to install and to operate for the rest of the family!Our little one loves to shake it and it doesn't move! I had only tried plastic or wooden gates before and was not that impressed. This metallic gate is the best!
5,Amazing gate!,"Work perfectly for the bottom of stairs, and although its pressure mounted, holds very well. I'm thinking to buy another one of this for the top of the stairs!About the handle, I read reviews that its difficult to open and operate, but its not as bad as it sounds. The handle does require some force to open but you get used to it."
4,Sturdy and well-made with a few caveats,"I bought this gate originally intending for it to go on the bottom of the stairs, but we just couldn't get it to work. Too small without and too big with the extension. We ended using it in a doorway instead. This gate is very sturdy and it's not going anywhere once you get it in place. That being said, it's not the easiest gate to install. It took my husband about a half an hour, and he's pretty savvy about that sort of thing. My only other problem with it is that I cannot get it open with one hand. This is difficult when I am trying to carry things from one room to another as I have to set whatever I am carrying down to open the gate. On the plus side, there's no way my child will be able to get it open.Otherwise, it's a good gate and I'm happy with it."
3,Works OK,"We installed ours at the bottom of the stairs between the banister post and the wall. Even with included extender piece, the screw posts are nearly maxed out. It's still stable enough to prevent our son from climbing the stairs. My main complaint with the unit is that the bottom of my shorts catch on the hinge every time I come down the stairs, and when I do I can hear the drywall breaking down from the torque on the pad."
2,Not the best...,Was unimpressed with this gate. Doesn't swing/close well and doesn't fit many spaces well...leaves little room for error...
3,Be careful!,"When I first installed the gate, the pressure from the gate was too intense and punched a hole in my wall! Make sure that you install on a solid stud, or wall surface. The gate works decently for me now, but I had to purchase 4 square pieces of metal and put them between my wall and each of the pressure points on the gate. This seemed to disburse some of the pressure and prevent holes."
5,GREAT GATE. GREAT PRICE. looks good too.,"if you're having trouble opening the gate, try standing sideways in front of the gate and pushing/pulling the slide-lock mechanism instead of facing the gate and trying to slide it sideways. makes it easier for people like me, with three babies and back and wrist problems."
3,Good gate for the price!,"I use this gate in my office door to keep my doggie inside, while still allowing my co-workers easy access. It was very easy to install. The handle can be a little difficult to operate, and usually requires 2 hands, but the price was very reasonable and it fits my needs."
3,It's a pretty good gate,"I like the fact that it's pressure mounted, and it stays in place better then some gates, but we have once or twice tripped over the bar on the bottom and knocked it out of place. We also had an issue with an opening that was just 1 inch to small to use the extension with it, and it didn't stay very well. It's also a little bothersome to have to remember to step over the bar, when there are gates out there that do not have that. My older kids (7&8) sometimes have a difficult getting this to open/shut correctly as well, they need to use both hands to open it. But overall the gates does the job it's supposed to."
5,evenflo simple step pressure gate,"We are using this product to keep the dog on the tile. The door to the gate is great. Even my 6 year has no problem opening the door to the gate. Only wish that there was a wider one because I have a 6 foot opening, so my husband had to build a temporary wall for me."
2,"Great concept, poor construction","I purchase 2 of these gates on Amazon. They installed very easily and I loved the general design and operation. Unfortunately the buttons on both gates jammed within the first two weeks of use. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but something to be aware of."
3,"Terrible instructions, good gate","The instructions are misleading -- they show a picture of the gate CLOSED before installation, and in reality, the gate only closes once the pressure knobs are fully tightened. DON'T return your gate when you see that it looks bent! Really confused me until I came on Amazon and realized that others had had the same problem as me.The gate itself is a great value for a hinged gate. Similar prices to some non-hinged models and much cheaper than most hinged ones. I've practiced the latch a few times and it's getting easier. Make sure you leave the 1/8"" in the latch as the instructions say. (It's one of the few places that the manual was correct!)"
3,Gate for the young only!,"Don't buy this gate if you have carpel tunnel, it's not that easy to open and close. It is acceptable otherwise, but is not always a ""one hand"" operation. I have only mild carpel tunnel and many days I need both hands to open this gate."
3,it's great when my kids don't tear it down!,I have this at the top of the stairs so my son won't fall down and it works great when my kids don't wiggle it loose. You can open and close one handed after you break it in and it is pretty durable. But as I said my kids have gotten it loose twice so far so it is unpredictable. I know it's not an installation error because my husband is superman when it comes to installing safety items around the house for the kids!
5,EASY TO INSTALL; GREAT FOR OUR DOG,"We had been looking for a gate like this since we got our new puppy Tonka. I was pretty lucky to find it at my local thrift store brand new for $18...great price! It is easy to install and I don't understand how people think it's hard to install. We, too, thought that there was something missing from the pressure bolts that go on the side. Once you fit the gate in the doorway, you have to screw it to where it applies pressure to the wall. I can see where the confusion would be, but coming from someone who doesn't know a thing about handy work, it was pretty easy to figure out. It's the perfect size for our puppy (he's a Staffordshire Bull Terrier) and he won't be able to jump over it since he'll only get to about 16 inches tall. We highly recommend this gate and it seems very sturdy!"
5,Wonderful!,This is one of the best books I have ever read! I also think it would make a fabulous movie. The blending of past and present was done in superior style. I just can't say enough good things about the book. I will most certainly look for other books by this author!
2,Like reading two different books,"I really wanted to be wowed by this book, but I wasn't. In fact I had to struggle to finish it. Such hope and promise but the author failed to bring it home. Great characters, but not totally developed. There were times when I was able to put myself in the car with the three women and picture them traveling down the road with their belongings, but it needed more dialogue between the women. I ended up making up conversations with them in my head. It is horrible to love the characters so much and then they just sit there on the page."
1,couldn't make myself finish it,"I have never written a review, but also this is only the 2nd book I just could not make myself finish. I just don't get it. It is too rambling... and I kept reading hoping it would come together but just couldn't waste any more time. I read over half (53% according to my kindle) and stopped. Sorry."
4,southern woman,"Amelia, the main character, switches back and forth between the present and one summer of her childhood. That particular summer, Amelia stays with a Negro family, attends their church and is `saved'. During that short time, Amelia finds her purpose in life. This story is about southern woman, friendship, faith, and the bonds we form thru out life."
5,Beautiful Doll,I am so pleased with this beautiful doll. It is in execellent condition. It is more than I expected. Thanks
3,ADVENTURER,ITS GONNA TAKE SOME GETTING USE TO CAUSE I HAVE A RUSSEL BUT I'M QUITE SURE SHE'LL GET USE TOO EVEN THOUGH SHE IS A SMALL DOG BUT KINDA THICK MIGHT HAVE TO SWITCH SHOULDERS
2,No-go for my 12lb Pug,"My pub loves to be held, carried, even zipped inside a fleece sweatshirt with me. But she would NOT relax to be carried in this sling. I ordered the camo backpack at the same time - that one does the trick. Holds her in, makes her secure."
3,Decent value,I have a 6 pound dog. She was too small to see over the sides so we built a PCV frame for inside. Now it is perfect.
2,No good,It did not come with the accessories. I am disappointed with this product. Also my dog won't use it. I do not recommend this one to anyone.
1,sling,dog can hang out even when clipped in; awkward shape for little dogs; uncomfortable to carry; not worth buying it
1,Not worth it,My dog hates this thing. Has no support. I now use it to carry firewood to the house. My dog runs when he sees it.
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed when I received this sling. It advertised that it would hold a pet up to 20 pounds. When I received and opened, it said right on the tag accommodates dogs to 12 pounds! My Japanese chin is 11 pounds and it seems quite uncomfortable for him. It is usable but not comfortable. It doesn't seem like it would be comfortable for a smaller dog either. It is long and thin. My dog takes up only a small portion of the bag because his body just squishes to one side in it! Maybe if it were deeper? I think he would be more comfortable in one of my own pocketbooks. Very odd shape for carrying a dog. Also, the little pocket in the front in very cheesy looking ."
3,Not very comfortable to carry,"This sling is well made, but could use much more padding in the shoulder strap. It is rated for pets up to 20 pounds, but I found it a bit cramped for my 15 pound Pug. Maybe good for pets in the sub 12 pound range, but in my opinion, problematic for any over that weight."
4,LOVE THIS!,"I HAVE A 13 WEEK OLD YORKIE AND SHE HASNT LIKED BAGS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO CONFINED. THIS SLING SHE DOESNT MIND. I TOOK HER FOR A LONG WALK AND IT WAS PERFECT. AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IT CAN GET UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT OVERALL GREAT BAG AND DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY:)"
3,Pretty Good,"My only concern with the sling is the bottom. I feel it should have more support. My dog is only 7lbs and could jump out but is getting used to it, he was not crazy about it at first. Now he seems to enjoy it as he gets to go to restaurant patios and will stay on my lap in the sling. Still fights being ""put in"" and then will relax. All in all, I like it and do use it."
4,Good for when the little guys have had enough walkies!,"I own this carrier and three dogs, each under 12 lbs. My oldest dog is 9, and not an athlete! I wear the empty sling when we go for walks, and when he has had enough, he gets a break riding on my hip. We also take our dogs to dog friendly outside festivals, and when they get overwhelmed looking at all the ankles around them, someone gets carried by dad, (too cool for a sling) and someone gets a ride with mom. I'm giving it a 4 because although it's a good value and made of material that doesn't fray or tear easily, it's not sexy. If anyone is having a problem with a very small dog getting lost in the thing or struggling and flopping around, try putting a small sherpa mat like the ones made for the bottom of a crate into the bottom of the Sling-o. It gives it more stability and is cozier for the little guys."
3,Go Sling,"When I initially read their product description I believe they said it was good for a smallish dog up to 20 lbs. Upon arrival, printed info stated ""good for 12 lbs."" Now, granted my mini-dachsy is a tad Rubenesque she's two lbs above the 12 lb limit and therefore I'm constantly checking to see if she's choking or not. Pardon the doggy lingo, but it's a doggy crapshoot."
4,teddy loves being an outward hound,I use this Outward Hound carrier when traveling with my doxie x toy poodle. He loves this sling and rides very comfortably inside it. He's about 13-14lbs and 11 inches tall at the shoulder; this provides sling a great fit for him.The sling has a center buckle which helps secure him in and there's a second clip for the collar as well. The little zipper pouch is a great place to store an emergency poop bag. There's even just enough room for a small blanket for warmth or extra cushioning. Made of very sturdy fabric that's been pretty resistant to hair or dirt.Other reviews have complained the should strap is not padded enough; I did not find this to be an issue.I've tried a few styles of slings and this one is the is the most functional. Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.
1,For VERY small dogs,"False advertising,Ad says up to 20 lbs. ...When we received, box says up to 12 lbs.This is a great product for a very small dog, like tea cup size dogs !"
1,sling go pet sling,I did not like the sling at all. My yorkie did not want to stay put in it. The canvass material is not soft and the strap is way too long.
5,Pet carrier,"A very good product for my yorkie who just had double knee surgeries. He isn't allowed to walk for 2 weeks, then not allowed to walk very far for a month--absolutely cannot do any stairs for 2 months. I would have been crazy without a carrier. Thank you."
2,Didn't work for my shih tzu,"Other reviewers are right. Too short on the sides for my 14 pound shih tzu. I thought I was going to lose him! The design is also high where the dog's head goes, so it chokes him a bit. Returning."
4,Great!,The sling carrier is very durable and easy to use. My pup is comfortable when riding in it. The bag came just in time for our trip.
2,Absolutely Ridiculous and Poorly Engineered,"Everything about this bag is just wrong... It's flimsy, shallow in very awkward areas and cheaply made. If you have an 8 pound terrier this will likely somehow work for you -- otherwise it's just a disaster. My 18 pound Italian Greyhound could only sit up straight and awkwardly twisted her body to fit this flimsy, non-supportive bag. I expected the bottom to be padded more than a cotton ball amount and for the bag to have at least a little structure -- just like how the photograph displays. Instead it's just a poorly made and falsely depicted product. Considering how cheap this thing is, it's just not worth the return and hassle."
2,Chokey,"We got this for our aged Toy Yorkie, 5lbs, who freaks out when he left alone in the car.I tried every way to make this work, but, in the end, I have to constantly shield his throat area with one hand because the elastic edge keeps riding up under his chin, then he starts choking. Not good.Otherwise, he liked it, he was comfortable, and even more so when I tried lining it with some fleece to try to pad the edges. But my hope was for a hands free carrier, so I can shoot photos while having him safely contained, and this did not work out."
4,"Great sling, but strap is NOT padded","I have used this sling for my 12 pound Havanese, and he does well in it thus far. But while I read manufacturer descriptions of a padded shoulder strap, the strap is NOT padded. If your dog is near the 20 lb weight limit, this could get uncomfortable rather quickly. I wished for padding with my little guy-- and I wore the sling over a shirt, sweater, and winter jacket. Also, if I wear it at hip height (any longer doesn't really make sense), the plastic buckle is high up against my shoulder blades and uncomfortable. Because I was wearing it over many layers for a winter outing, it was fine, but I'll have to figure something out for warmer weather use. But it generally is a great idea. Much easier than toting him around in his sherpa bag (though I can't hide the fact that I am carrying a dog when he's in the sling). It was easy to be on the NYC subway and go shopping with the dog in the sling."
2,puppy carrier,"The design isn't the greatest, there needs to be a bottom that the dog can sit on, and the sides need redesigning so as to be closeable or adjustable so as to keep the dog secure. Velcro and zippers strategically placed would help in this carrier design. The picture is misleading...The lady is just standing there, and I doubt that she is more than a model during a photo-op."
1,not for tiny dogs,"Bought this to carry around a 1.5 lb chihuahua, but she can easily fall out of it. Not for tiny dogs!! Not manufactures fault, but it should come with a warning."
4,Good for puppies,Handy when you have a puppy the mother has rejected or a weaning puppy that needs a lot of attention.
2,Difficult to use,I found this very difficult to use. The 'pocket' for our puppy was not deep enough and the shape made it difficult for her to stay in. Straps were very uncomfortable...an actual baby sling was much more useful.
1,Too flimsy!,I have a 7lb maltese/terrier mix and this was way too flimsy for my dog. This would be good for a teacup breed or a small dog with very short legs. I returned this purchase.
4,Good for small puppy,"It's so convenient to bring my puppy with me anywhere I went. However, she doesn't want to stay in that carrier anymore since she's growing bigger. She's now 9 lbs and the bag is just fit. It's definitely a great idea if you have a tiny breed."
4,OK,"this is supposed to be for a small dog. My dog is tiny, but I don't think it would even fit a dog twice his size. It is made well, but isn't a fit for us."
4,Sling,"I really appreciate this product, and I feel that my miniature dachshund fits in it pretty well. I do wish there was a little more cushion in the bottom or something to help keep the puppy warm while in the sling, but overall very satisfied."
4,Love it!,"I bought this for my sister in law, who has a 10 pound cat who cries to be held 24-7. He was wary of the carrier at first, but as soon as he got comfortable he began purring and absolutely loved it! This is a lifesaver for my sister in law, who can now carry him around and still have both hands to do other work."
3,Not what I expected...,"I ordered this hoping I'd have a low maintenance, non-frilly bag for my 8lb little one. I wanted one that would fit her long body (she's a shih tzu) and not give her a stiff neck at the same time. This bag is like a fabric canoe...or hammock...Although there is a strap across the top (presumably to hold her in? There's also a hook on either side to latch onto a collar) I worry that she could still fall out or jump out. Also, I don't know if it's because it's super stretchy, but I had to shorten the strap a LOT to make sure the bag didn't swing down by my knees.I wish the bottom were sturdier. I will probably add a small folded blanket or something to the bottom to give it a little more structure and padding.This bag is okay. You get what you pay for. I still feel like there are better, more attractive bags out there that simultaneously aren't frilly, overpriced lame Juicy Couture monstrosities."
4,Good for small animals,I got the sling for my mom and cat...half as a joke. The cat is 8 pounds and seemed to fit well. We put my 20 lb pug mix in the sling just to try it out and it didn't really work all the well. The pug was definitly squished into the sling and felt pretty heavy on one shoulder. The product is well made and if you think your pet would like it I would recomend it but not for animals much larger than 10 or so pounds.
1,Not as advertised,"In my opinion the Outward Hound Sling-Go Pet Sling is falsely advertised. It advertises to accomodate pets up to 2o lbs., but was extremely uncomfortable on my shoulder for my 14 lb. Shih-Tzu. The package even advertises a Shih-Tzu in the sling! Do not let the advertising fool you. It may work for a much smaller pet."
4,PET SLING,"DESCRIPTION LISTS THAT SLING IS SUITABLE FOR LARGER DOGS THAN IT REALLY IS. STILL THIS IS A GOOD SLING FOR SMALLER DOGS, PROBABLY 10 POUNDS AND UNDER. DIFINETLY NOT GREAT FOR DOGS WITH LONG LEGS SUCH AS A 15 POUND JACK RUSSELL.THE SLING IS STURDY AND WELL MADE, ALTHOUGH IT COULD USE MORE SOFT PADDING INSIDED."
2,Too small for a 9 pound dog,"I wish I would have listened to the reviews concerning how shallow this product is. I have a 9 lb pomeranian andshe is much too big to fit in this carrier. Half of her body sticks out and it's obvious she is very uncomfortable.It's not made for a dog more than 5-7 lbs in my opinion, even though it states it is. Also, the strap digs into myshoulder which makes it very uncomfortable when you are hiking a trail for a few hours. I'm sure for a smaller dog,this product is great. Just not impressed with the design for my puppy at all."
2,My dog didnt like it,The bag has no support on the bottom so your dog practically gets involuntarily curled into a ball If it was a young dog it would be ok I guess but my dog being older I don't want to put that much stress on her spine also I could see that she was not comfortable. I have a little French poodle by the way. You can see from the picture the bag is not rigid at the bottom but the dog looks like he is sitting quite happily and my dog was not like that she was all curled up and was uncomfortably trying to sit or get out
3,it's aight,I got this for my 4 lb chihuahua. It fits and she's able to sit comfortably but the material is a little hard on the skin. We live on an island and it's fairly hot here so usually i am wearing a sleeveless shirt or something where my skin is exposed and comes in contact with the fabric of this. That's my only grip. Other than that it's cool. No frills.
4,"So far, I like it","The sling is made of good quality materials. I have been using it as needed for my boston terrier puppy who is about 7 lbs now at 3 months of age. I like that the sling will still accomodate my dog as she grows. I use the sling to carry my puppy on hikes, long walks and sometimes to sneak her into a store or too. My puppy seems comfortable. So far, I like it."
2,Uncomfortable,"Our 10lb. poodle/spaniel mix was comfortable enough and the construction of the sling was fine, but there's not padding for your shoulder. After about ten minutes we found the sling too uncomfortable."
4,Cute,Technically you aren't supposed to take this in places where the dog has to be enclosed so be careful. I've seen people use this for transporting their dogs on the subway but I'd rather not risk the fine. My dog fits in it and feels comfortable. He likes being close to me and its much easier to use this because it's handsfree. I only use it for short walks.
2,Decent product but...,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for a family member and his new chihuahua, however it felt too heavy and cumbersome to carry. Both of us tried it, and had the same thought. It's too bad, because it's a decent product, and a great idea!"
2,Would not recommend,My dog is about 13 lbs and I would not recommend this sling. It does not have padding in the shoulder strap and it hurts to wear it with a dog in it. It is also very difficult to get the dog in the sling.
3,It's ok,"My dog is about 15 lbs and he doesn't fit very well in the sling. I like this for carrying him after he's gotten super tired on a hike and will lay down, but he can not sit up in the sling without it pitching forward. He almost face planted on the ground a couple times while trying to sit."
4,pet sling carrier review,"I purchased this sling/carrier for my cat. It arrived within the week in spite of being during Xmas season, very well packed and in excellent condition. The carrier is solidly constructed and adjustable as to how high or low you want to carry the pet, and has straps in the pocket for added security, to attach to a pet collar or harness. Essential for independently minded cats.Only suggestion I might have is to add a bit of padding to the shoulder strap, for increased comfort to the human. My kitten Foxy (age 6 months) likes being carried in it, especially when I spray a little catnip inside. However, he is still so feisty that he soon insists on exploring on his own four feet down below (he is also leash and halter trained). This carrier also comes in handy indoors, as an alternative to Foxy climbing where he shouldn't, and giving him an ""almost"" human level view of what his human (me) is doing."
3,well made but my cat didn't like,"I bought this bag for a kitten I thought had ""wobbly cat"" but turned out he had a brain tumor so he didn't survive. My new kitten is ambivalent about it. It is well constructed."
3,sling go pet sling,The product was good quality and works as described but my little dog was so stressed out just trying to put her in it. That i stopped using it and gave it away.
1,DISAPPOINTED,My gift recepient never received the gift; Amazon said they weren't responsible and the pet place never returned my email. Very disappointing and I lost $40.
1,Didn't work for me,"I have a 9lb Yorkshire Terrier. He didn't fit in it comfortably. The bag is really shallow and he kept hanging out of the sling. On top of that, the strap is actually pretty painful when he was in it for more than 2 minutes. I'm a pretty strong girl so it wasn't that he was too heavy, the strap just cut into my shoulder. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone besides people who own toy breeds. I bought a purse type bag at a department store for 10 bucks and it works much better for us"
3,Nice idea but lacks in execution,"While this sling sounds like a great idea, and my dog (2 lbs) does fit, neither of us enjoyed the experience. She was awkward to carry like this, and there wasn't much stability, making us both uncomfortable. It's one thing to have a tote full of items like laundry or school supplies that swings and bumps while you carry it, but it's quite another when it is your fur-baby bumping around inside. It might work for some folks, and while I don't have a problem with the quality of the item - it was very well made, it just didn't work for us."
1,Not what it claims,"Amazon product info says this sling can handle an animal that weighs up to 20 lbs. The package says up to 12. The Amazon product description claims this is due to ""old packaging."" Doesn't inspire confidence. Shoulder strap: Package claims it's padded. It is not padded. Sling bottom: Package claims it's padded. It is not. The elastic neck thing cinches up around the animal, and the whole apparatus acts exactly as you would expect a non-reinforced, non-padded synthetic bag to act if you dumped an animal into it. May as well be carrying the dog in a laundry sack. It's clearly not comfortable for the puppy. I end up putting at least one arm under the bag to give the dog some confidence and stability -- essentially carrying the animal one-handed. Better than no pouch at all, but not what I paid for. I have a small messenger bag I used for a Mac Air and work papers that works better as a puppy-toter than this thing does."
4,Very convenient,"This comes in so handy for my 9 pound chihuahua. He sits in it without a problem and it gives me two free hands to do whatever I need to. The only issue I have with it, is that the strap to hold it closed seems a bit tight and I'm not sure if it would keep a fidgety dog in. For me, though, it's great!"
3,A Little Hard to Use,"My dog weighs 8 pounds, so he does fit in the carrier, but it is hard to get him in it. I have to turn the carrier upside down over him and sort of scoop him up. At first he hated it, now he is tolerating it. He is a pretty mellow guy, but putting him the carrier made him nervous. I had to train him with treats and work up to it and, I put his favorite blanket in the bottom. The carrier is shallow, so it's not as though the dog is ""enclosed"". There is a strap to keep the dog in, but it seems that forcing the dog to be immobilized would make things even less comfortable.It will take a while to see if this works for us."
3,not so good for short dogs,"I bought this bag for my miniature dachshundhe is not tall enough to comfortably stick his head out...and he likes to have his head outIf you are thinking about purchasing for your small dog my recommendation would be to purchase for a taller dog, or a short one that doesn't want to know where it's going...."
3,not suited for my needs may for someone else,I purchased this for our 8lb Shorky. He fit in it ok but it seems the way the clasps are positioned the sides seemed to want to come up and choke him. It just didn't quite work for my purposes so I'm giving it a 3 as it may work better for someone else.
3,Good quality but not deep enough,"I like the quality of the product, but it is too wide and not deep enough. I have a tiny chihuahua and when he stands up, he is way over the top. He never seems to want to lie down in it. However, it is comfortable and easy to carry around. Just wish it were a few inches deeper."
3,The Circus is Coming,"I was slightly dissapointed because of so much hissing of the steam. It seems the the recording wanted to prove that it was a steam calliope rather than for the enjoyment of the music. I remember the parades down Walnut street in Muncie, the smells, gaudy sights of costume and the animals marching to the music of the calliope and the circus band. It is a good piece of nostalgia."
4,Brings back memories,We needed this music for an upcoming parade. We have listened toit a number of times just for the memories and enjoy all the selections.
5,The Best Book on the Market!,"This story was just plain wonderful. It even made me laugh out loud on the New York subway...It would be a tragedy for anyone NOT to read this terrific book. Go for it, folks!"
5,The best novel of our times.,I've never laughed and cried so much over any other book. I recommend this to EVERYONE.
4,Good Read,"So it's a little too cute and predictable..so what? It's also a book that will make you feel some emotion.... try and find some of THAT in a NY times bestseller. And as far fetched as these relationships between the characters in this book might have seemed, kudos to the author for making them believable. A good book."
3,Last days of summer,Its good if you like baseball. Not a story line I'm into. Still held my interest and read the book.
5,Delightful,"I have no idea how I went through life this long without reading this brilliant work. This book had me laughing out loud (and scaring the hell out of my family and pets) and at points brought me to tears. It is a fun--more than just fun--read and a definite favorite. Steve Kluger puts his own spin to what could have been an ordinary story. He puts life into his works and makes this book unforgettable and something that will be spoken about for years and years. His unique style of using newspaper clippings, faxes, letters, telegraphs, and more to tell the story brings even more depth to the story as well as more character. An all-time favorite and a definite read for anyone craving a great book."
2,Just TOO Cute!!!!!!!,"OK. The book has some nice things going for it. The mix of letters, report cards, newspaper articles, etc. is clever. And it started out with an interesting premise. But the precocious main character Joey became more and more unbearable with each page. He became a stereotyped ""loveable little scamp"" of WWII vintage who hobnobs with stars of stage, screen and ballpark, personally corresponds with the White House, dances with Eleanor Roosevelt, etc. etc. ad nauseam. If he had built a space ship with scrap auto parts and flown it to the moon it would have fit right in. The ending is so predictable it's pathetic."
2,????,"After reading all these 5-star reviews I expected this book to be a grand slam, but all I got was a walk to first. The characters come across like cutouts from a comic book, in a story that reads like something a 12 year old kid might dream up for English class (and get a C in-- OK, maybe a C+). I suppose the author was trying to convey something like the poignancy and cuteness of the old Little Rascals series, but he ends the book with a completely predictable ""tragedy"" which plunked no heartstrings here. Phony, contrived and lifeless. Forget it."
5,When baseball was king in Brooklyn,"It's always a delight to me to find a book by an author of whom I had never heard, buy it, and then enjoy it tremendously. So it was with this book, which I bought on a whim, and read quickly from cover to cover. The author has a good handle on the vioce of a young boy, and his insertion of various newspaper clippings adds to the feeling of reality. This is a sort of ""coming of age"" book, and it will make you laugh and cry in turn. I don't want to give away the plot, but I could see the ending coming from a long way off. Even so, that didn't make it any less heartbreaking to read. I know that everyone who reads this book will enjoy it, as I have."
5,Simply Beautiful,"If I could rate this book 10 stars, I would. As a sucker for sports books, I looked forward to reading this book only for the sports content. This book cannot be categorized as a sports book, as it deals poignantly with a Jewish adolescent growing up in World War 2 Brooklyn. A truly moving and still hilarious story, a must read for all adults and young adults alike."
4,Pretty Good Read,"Not a bad read. Entertaining and fun. Little bit of bad language and the format of the book is a way different then normal, but it is good."
5,a story so capturing you don't want it to end,"If you only read one book this is the one to read!It is a wonderful story of two souls who find each other and themselves. A delightful tale of friendship, and growing up--no matter what age one is. This book will make you laugh, giggle, think and cry. An amazing read."
5,"Terrific, hilarious, warm, made me laugh out loud","Great book. Made me both laugh out loud and wimper, a very embarrasing situation on a Continental airlines flight. Excellent."
5,Southern Gospel Music,This CD was ideal since most of the old school southern gospel is out of print or difficult to find. The seller did a superb job in providing an original sleeve and most importantly fabulous audio. There was also no apparent damages or scratches when the CD arrived as the seller provided additional care in packing the CD for delivery.
3,The sheep are our favorite!,"Around our house, all our favorite books are about these silly sheep. We owned this book in paperback and the kids had ruined it from abuse and so much reading. Now we can read it electronically on our Kindle!That being said, the actual implementation of the book in Kindle form isn't great. Lots of duplicate lines and poorly laid out formatting. It's readable, but they certainly could have done a better job with it."
5,Fun Fun Fun,"These books are so much fun. I was given the Sheep in a Jeep by an old family friend who said that it was her grandchildren's favorite books and it quickly became my daughter's favorite too (she was a year when given the book). So I went ahead and ordered a handful more... Sheep out to Eat and Sheep in a Shop are both very good and very comical especially when you own a flock of 30+ sheep. You can only imagine that's exactly how sheep would behave if in these circumstances. The rhyming is excellent, the illustrations are hilarious and I would highly recommend these books to you."
4,Good book,"The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that my husband and duaghters don't seem to like it as much as Sheep in a Jeep. I found it charming, well illustrated and well told.I was disappointed that it was a paperback and not a board book. I might not have bought it if I had realized that because my daughters are a bit rough on books."
4,"Our son not as interested yet in this one, but perhaps soon...","This is our third sheep book. We have Sheep in a Jeep and Sheep in a Shop. My 2 year old likes the sheep but hasn't quite gotten into this one yet. I think he will when he starts to understand more about manners when you are out to eat. He knows all about please and thank you, but we don't go out to eat very much, and so it's not as familiar to him. It's just a matter of time, I'm sure."
1,Huge disappointment,"We received Sheep in a Jeep as a present when my son was born and I nearly tore my stitches I laughed so hard.My now 1 year old LOVES Sheep in a Jeep.So, I bought this one expecting the same type of humor and level of writing. This one seems like it was written in a day just to get another book out there. It isn't funny, the rhymes are clumsy and I did NOT necessarily like the message - which the first time around felt to me like something along the lines of ""don't try to venture out where you don't belong"" and ""stick with what you know"". Messages I'm not really excited for my toddler to learn.Just one mama's opinion, but again. disappointed."
2,No for Pros!,"I own a small home improvement/remodeling company and own many fine tools that I depend on everyday to make a living. I think this brad nailer is a BIG joke, it does NOT countersink nails, jams quite frequently, looks cheap and is not comfortable to grip due to the way the foam overlaps itself on the handle."
5,Great gun,"I use this gun everyday for installation of trim work. I install crown moulding, baseboards, and casing. I've used Porter Cable, Dewalt, and Hitachi and this Senco is the best. I love that it's more quiet than the rest, the air doesn't blow right into your face, and also the holes it leaves behind are alot smaller than what the others leave. Those are the three main reason I love this gun."
3,"Good for a quick workout with speed bags, but...",You'll need another pair of gloves if you have a heavy bag and actually want to do more than tap it. These gloves just don't offer enough protection and shock absorption.
5,What more do ya need?,"There's one more thing you should know about this glove, it has a small metal bar handle in the middle for when you clench your fist, and trust me, the handling on this glove is a dream come true.With softness, easy off and on, and grip, I would recommend this for your hands.Your fist will thank you."
2,Doesn't offer very much protection,"These gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they're very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand. In addition, the padding is very thin. I wouldn't recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer. They're probably fine for the speed bag.If you're going to use these gloves, at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or, like me, you'll probably loose some skin from your knuckles.For not very much more money, you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection."
2,Good for starting out,These gloves came with my bag and they are more than comfortable for when I was first getting used to it.I'm giving it 3 stars for now because something about the internal material rubbed my knuckles the wrong way and since I don't want to stop working out I have a near dime sized perpetual scab on my pinky knuckles.I'm going to purchase another pair at which point I'll come back and change my review relative to those.Edit: So I'm downgrading to a two because these gloves would not stop scabbing my knuckles and once I went at the bag for over an hour I took off the gloves to find my hands were complete fubar. They may have been a size too large but the material inside is what I'd say is to blame.
1,Not Usefull,"If you need impact protection (e.g. for heavy bag work) these provide no protection - you need to wrap your hands, preferably with long pro style hand wraps and use 14 oz or heavier gloves. For hand protection you may also want to look into using knuckle guards for use with wraps - but the guards are not appropriate for sparring use.Wraps provide structural support for the entire hand and wrist.These gloves do not.Cheers, Erik"
1,Too spicy.,"I intended to eat the tuna with salad for lunch. This thing is super hot. After downing the entire can, few hours later I really felt the burn in the toilet. Worse I can't return it.Even for someone who eats spicy food, this can be very hot and cause discomfort. Be careful. I do like safcol's lemon pepper, which is very good.UPDATE: Amazon just refunded for 10 cans because I was dissatisfied. Way to go, Amazon!"
2,The taste is not what I expected,"It does not taste like chipotle. I do like spicy foods, but the hot spicy flavor was a bit one-dimentional, in other words, there was no depth to the taste. I could replicate the same flavor by just adding a bunch of crushed chili peppers into a plain can of tuna."
1,Mystified by positive reviews,"This is lower quality than what we get at Wal-Mart. What flavor it has is akin to cat food. The small, red, elongated peppers it contains have none of the distinctive flavor of chipotle, for the simple reason that they are serrano peppers. G'Day Gourmet is incomparably better than this."
3,Just A Little Upset,"No, not about the downer of an ending, (which I should thank the last reviewer for giving away to us). It's me The guy with the constant reviews for the Pete & Pete DVDs, yeah, that's right, the same J Wood. I'm upset that this was the first of The Blair Witch Files to be cancelled, especially since it was cancelled before, SOME OF US, had a chance to even lay eyes on it!! Not that I'm, BITTER, or anything. I mean how long was this out for, less than a month? and then BOOM it's of the shelves already. not to mention the fact that it was part of a series. It's like starting a submarine sandwich in the middle, it just doesn't work. Did Bantam ever stop to think that maybe that was why they lost so many sales on this series? Also, I know this title is rare, but twenty five bucks for something that used to cost five? What are you nuts?! That's way too much!! I mean I'd like to get my hands on this book, but I'd also like to meet the person who would pay twenty five bucks for it."
2,Watered Down...Why bother call it Christian,These artists are some of the most watered down artists out there. I would give you a $1 for every time they actually refer or mention God and or Jesus. There really isn't any purpose for this album in the Christian realm. It's just a positve album...nothing more. At least they don't swear and the production is good.This world needs more from us.
4,Great Songs,"This album has some great songs by some amazing artists. Some of the best rappers in Christian music are on this cd and their talent shows greatly in their music. Regardless of what others might say, this cd is definitely worth your time and money. It is a must have for any real rap fan who wants to listen to some quality lyrics that don't involve cursing or references to murder, sex, and drugs."
3,Nice Controller - Doesn't work with Xbox Live!,The fan feature is very helpfull and it actually does cool you down so your hands don't sweat. It also has 2 different speeds which is cool. The controller feels very comfortable in your hands as well. If it worked with Xbox live I would give it 5 stars. Even though it has the expansion slots when you put in the Xbox live headpiece module in it doesn't work. I thought my first unit was defective and returned it for another one - with the same problem. I searched around on the internet and found out that others went through the same exact thing. It's too bad because it's really a neat controller. Get if it using it with Xbox Live! is not important to you.
4,Good folders,These are standard hanging folders. Nothing special but they get the job done. And for the money they are a great value.
3,"Satanist conspiracy thriller is diverting, nothing more","This book is standard Strieber, great concept flattened by mediocre writing. A Satanist cult is out to destroy the world with a super plague. Somewhere between The Stand and The X-Files, just nowhere near as good."
1,Worth skipping,"Strieber stumbles around the concept of a Satanic Church that plots the destruction of the human race by a special breeding program to create a meta-humanoid (The Anti-man)that will be the antithesis of all humanity regards as good. A plague will wipe out the old Homo sapiens, and then, well, that's the question, Satan rules supreme, I suppose. The Catholic Church is absolved of the sins of the Inquisition in this alternate reality,since they were just trying to root out the breeding program of the Satanists all those years, and continuing to do so to the present. And where did this arcane breeding knowledge come from? Why, from King Solomon! Strieber apparently wanted to weave in a bit of anti-Semitic blood libel into the tale.Luckily, I got my copy used, and since it is such utter trash, I didn't feel bad throwing into the recycling bin."
5,Tongue in cheek sequel to Alladdin,This is a very funny book that I read out loud to my 7 year old (a great book to read out loud) and had to stop very frequently to laugh. It is very well written and my daughter could not wait for the conclusion. I wish Noel Langley had written a sequel to the sequel. There are no really scary bits and the characters are really quite clever. Highly recommended
4,Fun toy for the kids,"I own many water guns, and when my nieces and nephews have a water gun fight, the one that has this gun always has the best time. It holds a nice amount of water and when the other kids are pumping their guns, they are getting soaked by the kid with this gun. I have owned this gun for almost 2 years now and it still works. This might not be the best water gun on the market, but I think its a great gun. Especially for the younger kids who can't pump the other guns very well."
4,Good Water Gun.,"I don't know what the other people are doing to their's, but it doesn't break easy. I've had it for more than 6 months and iv'e never had to change the batteries and never had to fix it. It could shoot farther though and the water stream doesn't have much soaking power. But you don't have to pump it so when your friemds pumping his you could get him good. This water gun is best when your friends ambush you beacause you can use it fast. Overall its ok."
4,"Cool Gun, gets bad mileage","I have a lot of squirt guns, and this one of my faves, considering that it's motorized. I like new ways to pump water out of a gun. It is very lightweight, and because of this it eats up the water like a big rig eats diesel. i will shoot for less than, oh, say 30 seconds and the tank is almost half empty. It's good for skirmishes, but if someone has a Flash Flood, be prepared to haul."
3,Secret to the problems,"I had the better version of this gun...and it worked pretty well, then i just didnt play with it anymore. i tried it again later and it didnt work. a year later I opened the battery compartment and the entire thing was corroded. the battery acid disolved all the battery holsters. If you want this thing to work, you have to take out the batteries after the use. Also Helixes, dont need to be pumped and shoot the crap of the better version of this gun. But this guns good to."
1,worst water gun in the world,"This gun is as big as a super soaker but shoots like a spray bottle! And it only works for the 1st 2 days before the inside rusts and it no longer shoots! It is a huge waste of money,batteries (6 AA not included),and patience! Get the Super Soaker XP-270 if you want a good water gun."
5,'A must' for followers of Leaon Trotosky,I was recommended this book by a friend and fellow thinker.I thought I knew Trotsky's works until I read this book. The book is a a well selelcted series of speeches and articles written by Trotsky in the most formative and active period of his life. The anthologist has cleverly managed to selective the pieces that most adequately represent Trotsky's ideas. It might well have been entitled 'Trotsky made easy.' Thouroughly recommended.Ted \mooney
3,A very usefull Book for musicians with experience,"This is a very usefullbook if you have more than a basic knowledge in Jazz, but if you are lookin to expand to the world of jazz you are aiming a little high with this book. Have a grat of usefull techniques ans scales to enrich your jazz knowledge.. Hoping you can get something of my advise..."
5,"""80s"" Jazz","While ""Rock was gettin stupid in the ""80s"" (O.K. there was some good stuff) Jazz on the other hand was flawlessly integrating the things that made the ""80s"" sound the way it did. Where ""Rock"" sounded goofey from that sound, Jazz musicians applied intelligence in its rendering. Passport was no exception and ""Eartborn"" is a very good, must have offering from this remarkable band."
2,Extendable Cherry Table,"This table was purchased for my great aunt who is elderly and doesn't live in my hometown. She reports that it came nicely packaged but that it's way too heavy for her to move the box out of her foyer. A table like this requires two people to move and set up. Buyer BEWARE: We dealt with Stacks & Stacks and learned their return policy the hard way.1. They did not reply to us in a timely mannershortening their 45 DAY RETURN POLICY from the day of delivery became a concern2. Their refund deducts $53 restocking fee3. Their refund deducts $64 shipping fee4. The return shipping has to be paid by YOU and handled by you.No Fedex or UPS shipping label will be issued from them for the return.Total refund offered is $236 not including the cost for us to ship it back to the seller. So, at this point we will not be returning it, and will have to resell it at a fraction of the cost paid."
4,Up to the expectations,"I have a little dinning area and I was looking for a table that could seat 4 people and extend to 6 or 8. I also did not want large dimensions. After and extensive research this product was the only one meeting my criteria.The table came very well packaged, the quality in term of construction and finish was good. The 40 x 40 allow 4 people seating in comfort and in reality you don't need bigger, the proportions are excellent, the relation price quality is also excellent. I did not give 5 because I use the table with 4 seat and the table top folds in 3 parts instead of the usual 2. This 3th line is the only ""surprise"" I had; however the parts match well and is barely noticeable.At last I would suggest the manucaturer to have a table that goes from 4 to 8 and avoid the console"
5,A CD Worth Purchasing,"I was very excited when I heard that Leigh Nash was coming out with a solo project because I was a big fan of Sixpence None the Richer. I must say that I listen to this CD everyday without getting tired of it - it stays in my CD player. Leigh Nash has a relaxing, angelic, and innnocent voice that draws you in, and her voice is also complimented by the piano. All of the songs add to the CD as a whole, although my personal favorites include: 'My Idea of Heaven', 'Ocean Sized Love', 'Cloud Nine', and perhaps most of all, 'A Little More.' Any fan of Sixpence or anyone who is looking for a CD worth purchasing will not be disappointed with Leigh Nash's 'Blue on Blue.'"
3,I have to agree...,"After I listen to this cd a couple more times, I stop play it! (Don't even have to desire to listen to this cd again, which is kinda unusually for me) There's just something seems to be missing in this CD. Don't get me wrong, I think Leigh Nash has a beautiful voice, but when VERY song sounds so soft and DULL, it just gets kinda boring. I mean everytime i finish listen to the whole CD, none of the song actually stick to my mind, i guess what i am trying to say is that this CD has NO EXCITIMENT! So, i suggest those who still haven't get this cd and about to get it. I really think you should see and try to borrow this cd from a friend and listen to it a couples day, and if you find yourself liking it more and more, then go ahead and get it. Because I think it's stupid to spend $14 bucks (it's not a lot, but you can get a good movie though???) on a cd, and later you going to hate it."
2,Why does anyone like this CD?,"I don't get it. After reading the amazon reviews for this disc, I was was enthusiastic to get my hands on it. I have always enjoyed Nash's vocals on various Delerium tracks, and while most of my music-friends thought Sixpence was dull, I personally have listened to Devine Discontent about a thousand times. I love it. But, I'm sorry folks, Blue on Blue is just awful! Dull lyrics, dull tunes, dull instruments. There are no catchy songs, there are no deep, thoughtful songs. And none of the songs really make much use of Nash's voice. Here, her distinctive voice isn't distinctive at all. Blue on Blue is about as generic and nondescript as possible. Boo! 2 stars! 1 star! Boo!"
5,"A beautiful jewel - pitch-perfect, ethereal, and vulnerable.","Despite her 15 years in the music business, Leigh Nash is still a young woman. Not all that much older than the age where many musicians are just starting their careers. Technically she is a new solo artist, but many will recognize her voice as the lead singer of Sixpence None the Richer. With a platinum album and Grammy nomination under her belt, Nash is no newcomer and yet she maintains an innocence and fresh feeling throughout her debut solo CD.Leigh's voice is the shining star of Blue on Blue. She sings with a flawless blend of strength and frailty -- a beautiful jewel, pitch-perfect, ethereal, and vulnerable. Let's not forget Blue on Blue is a debut CD, and with continued solid promotion this album will do well and set up even better things for Leigh. Expect her to continue to grow as a songwriter, and if she keeps her producer and crew together for her next album, watch out world!Song by song review available at SockSpider."
5,Super Dooper !!,I never paid much attention to Six Pence or her other work but she has me cornered on this one and I can't stop playing it over & over.
5,Wish I'd known about it sooner.,"I'm not the type to buy albums with any frequency. I probably average 3 or 4 each year. I know what I like and am extremely picky. I seek strong composition, harmonies, word use, and meaning in my songs. I grew up during the 80's but enjoy pop/rock songs from the 70's through today's current trends.Now that you understand a bit about my background, I am astonished an album of this quality wasn't more mainstream shortly after it's release. I recently purchased it and cannot stop listening to it. It's ethereal and meaninful. Even though it covers a Crowded House song, other songs on the album echo Crowded House's style but are still unique unto Leigh Nash. I also hear faint echoes of Sarah Mclachlan and current country offerings.In summation, a great album!"
1,Horrible..,"This novel was horrible. It's filled with useless plot lines, unimaginative violence, and an anti-climatic ending. Not only that, but the artwork doesnt carry this kind of failure at writing like some artists manage. So over all it a steaming pile of garbage. If you are intested in collecting hard to find or unique comics then maybe this is for you."
5,thee amp,wasn`t sure I would like it but when it came and I used it for a gig was impressed and glad I spent the money. Use it for a practice amp at home. Charge it for 8 hrs and play for 8 hrs!!!
3,Not as good as the old ones,"We used Corelle Country Gardens with our large family for years. It took a lot of heavy use and we loved it. We remodeled the kitchen and bought our new Calloway corelle. It's been a month and one of the saucers is chipped so badly at the edge that we had to toss it. We returned the salt and pepper shakers because the holes were so huge that you could dump teaspoons out in a shake ( and they were not centered. Lastly, the cups all used to be porcelin---imagine our disappointment to find these are pottery."
2,To Small,I order a 7 1/2 in this shoe however when I got the shoe it look and felt like a 6...I was very disappointed.
3,Good ideas for the family,"Doris has taken ideas from her own household and others to fill this book with ideas of bringing the family together around the table. This is her mission and a very valid one in today's world of two income families and rush, rush, rush. Although there are some good ideas, I found it to have a little too much fluff to up the page count of this small book. But I still believe in the book's intent and will be giving copies to my brother and friend for them to get ideas for raising my nephew and godson."
3,We aren't in 1950,"I'm a brazilian and I live in Ceara, a Brazil's state.I read this very short book.It's available for free reading on a internet site.This very short book is concise and easy, to read and understand.Why I given't fives stars for it?Because we aren't in 1950.The Paul Blanshard's frauds are now, at least the majority of them, are too absurds to be told.The time was against the Blanshard's frauds.Paul Blanshard himself recognized this.He became an atheist and a communist, in 1970 decade.After Paul Blashard, new americans and anti-catholic crooks came:Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker, etc.A new time, a new crook."
5,Cooool Glow-in-the-Dark ZOMBIES!!!,"These are selling like hot cakes so they have to be good! When I originally put them in my cart, they sold out and had to purchase from another vender. Now we are in the ZOMBIE craze age, ZOMBIE movies, ZOMBIE video games, ZOMBIE costumes, ZOMBIE shirts, ZOMBIE Legos, ZOMBIE board games, you name it!We bought these 100 G.I.D. dudes as Halloween/birthday party favors! Of course, the boys are going to love them! I also have more than enough to put them on shelves and on top of a cake since we will have a black light on that evening! For $10 dollars, these go far beyond expectation! My son says ""Mom, you are the coolest mom, thank you!"".....priceless!"
3,"Fun for the price, but consider it disposable","I bought this for my son's birthday party. I did buy it especially for one day's use so I guess it served it's purpose. The kids loved it. They had a ball catching the ""hair"" and using it to spray each other. We used it a couple times last summer and my son enjoyed it. This summer rolls around and we go to get it out of the garage only to find that all the foam parts have rotted away. Almost all the balls had fallen off and the hair is gone. Like other reviewers stated, it's REALLY difficult to get it to stick in the ground. If you don't mind your toys holding up for only one season, go for it. In hindsight, maybe it wasn't perfectly dry when we put it away, but I'm not sure how you'd get the water completely out of the tubes. We also have the Little Tikes Beachball Sprinkler, which he likes much better. It's cheaper and it's held up surprisingly well."
1,Broke too easily,The children loved this sprinkler but it cracked after 2 uses. The plastic used is not very sturdy. We waited for the the weather to be nice to use it and finally got some warm weather and then it broke. So sad...
1,Broke in Less Than 24 Hours!!,"I bought this toy for my son's 5th birthday. It was broken in less than a day. And, no, my children are not normally hard on toys. It just snapped right in the middle. Ugh. Complete waste of $$!!"
5,Mayada,The story of Mayada was one of the most compelling books I have ever read. This fact based book gives an insight into the live's of the Iraqi people. An insight we only get a glimpse of in the newspapers and on TV. The fear and intimidation these people have lived under for the past 30+ years was so disturbing that I found myself close to tears. What I most appreciated about this book is that the author has no political or self serving purpose for writing this story except to communicate the atrocities these human beings have suffered under this dictatorship. I would recommend this book to everyone I know!
4,in depth look at the regime,"This was a facinationg book. Mayada, originally liked by Saddam, tells the other innocent women in her cell of her experiences before being arrested and in prison and gives the reader a shocking idea of how brutal Irag was. Mayada also knows first hand a lot about Saddam and his family and how they thought and lived. I have a deeper understanding of how truly frightening and corrutp it was during his regime. A very interesting and well wriiten read."
5,Another wonderful book by Sasson,"As a huge fan of Jean Sasson, I keenly anticipated the release of Mayada, Daughter of Iraq. It was definitely worth the wait. This heart wrenching, eye opening book, tells the story of Mayada, an affluent Iraqi, and her experiences in prison in Iraq. A must read for all, especially considering the current circumstances. As usual, Sasson wrote with incredible flair. The magnificent descriptions really made you feel like you were there with Mayada, and made everything so real. I recommend this book to everyone, it is absolutely spectacular."
5,real people not characters,i have read h. hassan's review and am perplexed. perhaps my memory is more receptive but i remember the names of the real women(not characters) in cell 52 together with the real sufferings reported in the book. mayada symbolises the sufferings of the noble iraqi people and their victory over tyranny.the book vividly recounts the humiliation suffered by young and old due to the whims of the hot air filled dictatorswho used atrocious violence to keep themselves in power. but real life is a circle. the mighty are fallen and are now seen in their real guise. how many of us knew what was really going on in Iraq? i recomend this book to anybody who has real freedom at heart.
3,Jean Sassons books,"This is the third book by Sasson that I have read. They appear to be somewhat of a formula with a certain story line and something titilating added. I believe that she ran out of material for her Saudi Princess books and so has now went to Irag. Considering the state of affairs in the middle east, I believe that she would not be able to write the truth of the womens lives, as if she did, she would be unable to live there."
3,There's something missing,"When it comes to autobiographical or biographical books, like this one, and the events recounted are mainly dramatic and very sad, the impulse is to rate it with 5 stars. However, I find that this particular book, or rather, its narrative, seems to be lacking that something or other which would put the whole thing into a more tangible perspective. Of course one cannot but sympathise with Mayada and all the ""shadow women"" and what they went through as described (imprisonment and torture in Iraq).However this time, and unlike some previous work I read by the same author, I felt that the book lacks in substance a bit, some points have not been explained clearly and, in my opinion, the frequent descriptions of Mayada's fortunate background blur some more fundamental issues."
5,A Shocking Must-Read,"After reading the Princess Sultana Trilogy and developing a keen interest in the lives of Middle-Eastern women I knew I had to read Mayada's story. I could not put the book down. It is hard to imagine how one human can do such tings to another.Bravo to Mayada for her courage and to Jean Sasson for telling her story and the stories of the other Shadow Women to the world, and exposing this shocking secret."
4,Another stunning book,I have read Sassoon's Princess books and this book was as well written as they were. It is extremely interesting and I recommend it to anyone interested in a woman's life in Iraq prior to the fall of Saddam.
1,Mislabled Book,"I felt the book was in unacceptable condition and yet was labeled 'good'.Even though I communicated with the sender, they still maintained it was 'good.'This is my first experience with what I consider 'mislabeling.' All the other books I have purchased labeled 'good' have been just that."
3,It's OK,"Based on the reviews I was expecting this book to really draw me in, but I found myself skimming parts hoping I'd move on to something more interesting. Some of the stories are absolutely heartbreaking, but the reviewer below is right when he calls it a ""hodgepodge"" with no character development. The book is OK, but nothing great, and the frequent reference to GW Bush's goal of 'liberating Iraq' is annoying to say the least."
4,"Gorgeous, artistic Mezuzah","Really beautiful Mezuzah! I bought this for my new apartment, and am always looking for 'artsy' and colourful Jewish products. This was on sale, and was a great deal! The copper tube in the back that holds the scroll is unseen from the front, and the nails are perfectly long. Everything is high quality, colourful, and looks very nice. The only trouble is, I want another one!! The company Artazia makes gorgeous, high quality Mezuzah, but they are really, really really expensive. I'm glad I found this one on sale!!"
5,Not Entirely His Fault,"I think the author is trying to say the problems that plauged Russia after the collapse of the USSR was not all Yeltsin's fault. The IMF did not help matters nor did the former Communists who used their positions to loot the economy during privatization. Yeltsin too was a bit of a populist and as often happens populists make romantic rebels but horrible rulers. In the end the USSR was destroyed by the stupid 8 coup plotters who could not grasp the Soviet Union was not Guatemala and a coup in such a vast country was hopeless. The Republics were willing to sign the new union treaty but not after the coup. I was not fan of Gorbachev but history has proven he was right. If he had been allowed to do his program the USSR would still exists, and that whole region would be much more prosperous and stable than today."
3,"It is cool, but...","For the price they should have put more tracks instead of just nine or made it a two or three disc compilation set. The music is cool however track two and track nine are the same, this was kind of a downer."
4,a pleasant departure,"a huge fan here of the back to mine series since the day nick warren put out his version. i can say that it, the series, has travelled a varied path to freeland's release. a time when electronica has started a retreat back to the faithful, freeland provides a wonderful bridge connecting old school ambiance, fronted by a who's who of the resurgence of rock.nicely done, as said, a pleasant surprise - one that won't find itself in the recycle bin anytime soon..."
1,Back to Mine - Not Worth A Dime,"Wow, it's a rock album. Wow, not worth it. Wow, big mistake. Not a single breakbeat track. Don't buy if you want something even close to Coastal Breaks or Tectonics. Whew, I'm sweating, I've been had, and I'm bummed."
5,Every I Shall C Him,"This is a great album even though it isn't the best from Lee Williams! Yet how do you continue to out do yourself over and over anyway? Considering all their home runs this is still a slam dunk! To the Child of God Review, you've made yourself Judge of this group's salvation and beliefs and you aren't qualified! Only the Lord sees the heart! I Samuel 16:7"
4,Good product,"We use these for my mother at nite. I agree with another review that they don't fit very tight, but we use another regular depend over the tranquility and they work like a charm together. She wakes up in the morning with a dry bed and a soaked tranqulity, the depend usually stays dry, so we pull off the tranqulity and re-use the depend!"
5,Really great,"These are wonderful. I like that they're a USA company, and they work really well. They have served my needs completely."
2,Pass on This One,"I began reading financial books in 1997 starting with The Millionaire Next Door. I read at a rate of 10 financial books per year and picked up this book in 2001 shortly after it was published. I am disappointed to see that it is still in hardback. My purchase was based on the title: What was Absolute Financial Freedom? I judge a book not by its impact right after I read it but based on its impact years later. Did the concepts resonate with me? Did I use even one concept from the book to improve my overall financial picture? My answer was ""not so much.""Your Money or Your Life: 9 Steps to Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence: Revised and Updated for the 21st Centurydoes a better job of answering those questions at a fraction of the cost of this book. Go that route instead."
5,Impecable!,I don't have many words for this book...it left me speechless. The strength and weaknesses of humanity...the trial ans tibulations...oh lord...it's almost like a soap opera (I hate soaps but I loved thia book! )
5,Informative and Interesting,"The Cambridge Music Handbooks try to do what is rarely done-- bridge the gap between the dilettante ""light"" style of books on music that are written for the ""general public"" the esoteric style of heavy musicological writing. A noble pursuit, but one that runs the risk of pleasing no one rather than achieving a happy medium. Having read several of the Cambridge Music Handbooks, this one stands out as being one of the more successful. I especially enjoyed the discussion of the history of the forms which the Rhapsody in Blue has appeared (""jazzy"" versions versus ""classical"" renditions), as well as the background of the work's first performance in Aeolian Hall in 1924. At times, the book tends towards the more ""musicological"" style, but all in all, it remains accessible and interesting to anyone interested in music. Schiff's style throughout is engaging and witty. If this is a piece of music you are looking to explore further, I highly recommend this book."
4,Not a great airbrush,Iwata is the best in airbrush brands. I love made in Japan airbrushes but cm-c is not great & extreme airbrush for this price. Have got too much spit out & overspray.
4,a great represention of Frankie Lymon!,"Some of his best efforts are on here, and the sound quality is good. The CD case and insert are a little cheap but this has quickly become one of my favorites!"
1,Not what I expected,"A friend of mine gave me a taste of his spelt cakes and told me how healthy they were, especially for people on a low carb diet. They were quite good considering that they aren't a hunk of fresh hot Italian bread. He always buys Paskesz Spelt Cakes and after I read the one review of the Paskesz product, I found that the reviewer ordered that brand only because these Suzie's Spelt Cakes were out of stock. Thinking that this person actually knew what she was talking about when she said how wonderful the Suzie brand was, I went ahead and ordered the Suzie spelt cakes and they are awful. They have a very strong taste and they are vile - especially compared to the Paskesz ones I should have ordered to begin with. Now I have 11 packages of this dry, tasteless, puffy spelt that I will feed to the ducks in my back yard when they start arriving in my canal. I hope I don't kill them."
1,Terrible picture quality and buggy,"I received this as a Christmas gift and was looking forward to using it.It is supposed to be easy to load photos via a USB cable, but I found this interface to be flaky and report errors on my PC. I had to connect and reconnect several times to load anything on the picture frame. When it finally worked, the picture quality looked like something from the 1980s--pixelated and off-color. I'll be returning this for another brand."
1,Poor quality picture,"The problem with this is low dynamic range. The brights and the darks show up, but no middle. So the brightness level is flat. The pictures look awful, the background is dark and people's faces are too bright. weird..I got this as a gift and was going to return it for another when I read the other reviews here. Now I will ask the person who bought it to give me the receipt so I can get a different brand."
1,If you like picture clarity do not buy it,"Picture is quite fuzzy and the aspect ratio of the frame is 'widescreen' so your normal 4x6 ratio pictures are going to be clipped. Frankly pictures of people with with their heads clipped do not look that pretty!If you like picture clarity and no clipping, do not buy it."
1,Horrible,Picture quality is horrible. Darks are way too dark and light colors look over-exposed. the remainder of the picture is just really grainy. Customer service was contacted and was no help at all.STAY AWAY FROM PRODUCTS MADE BY THIS COMPANY!!
1,nothing but junk,Received this as a gift. Quality of the pics is awful. Look elsewhere for a digital frame. Cant return this product any sooner.
3,"Great Price & Size, Okay quality","The frame was better than I expected. I was expecting just a single digital frame (1 square) but instead got 4! 3 still frames, and one digital. Very pretty, and sturdy. Super easy to use which was great, and it has the ability to directly transfer images to the memory from your computer versus using memory cards, etc. The only CON, the image quality was not great at all. I had to enlarge the photos to be able to better see the people in the pictures. But as a gift, it was a good one!"
2,Great product if you dont mind fuzzy pictures,"We received this as a gift. While it was easy to get the photos on and started the quality is poor. I would be embarrassed to be an engineer for pandigital. Perhaps I could compress and fiddle with my images and things would look better, but with so many other competing devices why bother. Its now 2010, you should be able to load your photos and it should just work. I am glad I did not spend my money on this, you should look for another product. I am debating on sending this to my garbage or the local thrift store. What a waste."
1,Horrible Product,"We received the frame as a gift. The frame viewable area is extremely small (the diagonal length is 6""). The resolution is horrible. Do not buy this photo frame."
3,Great Frame - When it worked...,"I got the 5.6"" version of this frame for Christmas, worked great, easy to use, has lots of options on it, really enjoyed it... but it died after 6 months... (since they only come with a 90 day warrenty, I was out of luck for a replacment)."
4,Essential for Warren fans,"Even though I own Comic Book Artist #3, this book is a very expanded edition of that magazine. It is the definitive guide to Warren magazines and covers/interviews everyone & everything left out of the magazine. It is a crime that sleazeballs are selling this for $100 - $200! I found it for cover price ($29) at a San Francisco comic store in late 2009. Scour every comic store, before supporting slime merchants! It is also unfortunate that Two Morrows didn't reprint this classic, since it would obviously make them money. Perhaps there is still some lingering dispute between John B. Cooke and Morrow over copyrights, or over the contents of Warren magazines--which seem counter to Two Morrows more wholesome outlook."
3,Warriors of the Ohio,"The author has spent a lot of time researching for this book. I agree that there is not enough information about Girt and others. Girt did take part in frontier raids. However he did have advanced rheumatism that made a difference in his participation. No war is civilized and certainly not on the frontiers. Hintzen manages to keep his book moving. If you are interested in history this is a book for you. By Ruth Thompson Author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
2,Biased Narrative,"The author obviously has a great dislike for Native Americans. He portrays the Natives as being mindless blood thirsty savages that love killing helpless victims. Although many atrocities were commited on both Native and White sides, the author makes little mention of the latter. Ever hear of the ""Squaw Campaign""?"
3,Has issues running CFL loads,"Great value if you don't run CFL loads off this one. In my setup, it was tripping randomly when connected to 4 23W CFL lamps. 2 other inverters I had did not so must be a problem with this unit. If you don't plan to run CFL lamps, it's a great product. I especially like that the fan shuts down automatically under no load..."
4,Saved my food,"I bought this last summer just as an insurance policy. We had a winter storm a couple weeks ago that knocked out our power for 26 hours. I connected this to my wife's Prius, ran an extension cord into the kitchen, and it powered my fridge (a big side-by-side) for 24 hours and used one tick off her fuel meter. The Prius, btw, is the perfect vehicle for this because it turns the engine on and off as needed. It wasn't even running much of the time, although be sure to turn off your heater/ac in the car! I tried several other things as well. It would run my home internet and charge my phone. It would not, however, charge my UPS system for my computer - don't know why. And most depressingly, it would not run my DeLonghi Lattissima, so no lattes while we froze our butts off. I didn't get motivated enough to see if it would power our furnace since we had our gas fireplace going.Overall - a thoroughly good buy but I would recommend going up a few hundred watts until you can make coffee."
3,"Good, but don't expect a miracle","A news article touted this size inverter as capable of powering a refrigerator and operating a sump pump. That would be a very small fridge and pump. My modest refrigerator ran awhile, but the compressor blew out even though the rating plate showed current demand within the range of the inverter. The start-up demand is the problem. The device is too small to run a 1/3 HP sump pump. It cannot power a 3/4 HP air compressor.It is good for running small tools, electronic devices, and lights. During nearly two weeks following hurricane Sandy, I used it to heat a house, powering a gas-fired heating boiler with three heating zone pumps. It was clipped to the battery of an idling car which consumed a gallon of gasoline over several hours--far cheaper and quieter than running a portable generator."
1,Failed immediately after it went out of warranty,"I purchased this inverter from Amazon on 6-3-11 and it has seen only very light use in this time, never over 150 watts and then for only 1 hour or so at a time. Today, 6-20-12, I went out to check it, as it has been hooked up for several weeks in an enclosed trailer to a new solar charging system, keeping several vehicle batteries charged and found it failed, with a constant alarm and internal relay cycling.I purchased this inverter after evaluating numerous inverter manufacturers fact sheets, along with Amazon reviews and finally decided on Power Bright as my larger inverter manufacturer. I see I have chosen incorrectly and now have to reevaluate my decision and select a different manufacturer."
3,Works ok. Kicks off more than I'd like.,I've had this inverter for several months now and overall it works pretty well. It does kick off sometimes when I am running my 600 watt coffee maker and a couple of small lights and such. Not sure if it's the lightweight cables that came with the inverter and connect to my golf cart batteries or what.Anybody have any idea what gage those wires are?
1,Not enough,"I expected much more from this inverter.It cannot run a circular saw, cannot run a belt sander, cannot run a router.The only thing I could get it to run was a fan, and if I put anything else on the line, it bogs the fan and shuts off..If it's really 1800 peak, it should start the saw at very least, but it can't."
1,doesn't act like a 900 watt inverter,"HELLO BOUGHT THIS INVERTER SPECIFICALLY TO POWER THE 180 WATT BATTERY CHARGER THAT I USE TO POWER UP THE BATTERIES ON MY ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE.VERY DISAPPOINTING. IT IS A 900 WATT UNIT AND WHILE IT WOULD POWER OTHER 110 VOLT APPLIANCES, IT WOULD NOT RUN THE MUCH SMALLER DRAW THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED CHARGER. ONCE THE CHARGER WAS PLUGGED INTO THIS INVERTER, THIS INVERTER WOULD START BEEPING EVERY ATTEMPT.FUTHER, I EMAILED THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THIS UNIT 2 WEEKS AGO AND I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM.I BUILT MY OWM SOLAR PANELS, AND THEY WORK FINE. I PUT TOGETHER SOME 12 VOLT BATTERIES POSITIVE POSITIVE TO POSITIVE ETC. MY GOAL WAS TO HAVE ONE SOLAR POWERED RIDE ON MY MOTORCYCLE THIS FALL BEFORE IT WAS TIME TO PUT IT AWAY.THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.I DID MY PART, BUT WAS LET DOWN BY THIS PRODUCT.END OF REVIEWRodney7777"
2,Not worth the money...,"As an avid collector of David Austin books and roses, I was very displeased with this over priced book. It's pretty much his older books just rehashed with a few more added roses. The quality of the photographs are not very impressive. The book just seems to photograph each rose by itself as opposed to a full bush. I was hoping for a lot better quality for the price I paid for this book."
5,Field Guides,"As a fairly experienced science writer - http://www.sciencebase.com/resume.html - I didn't anticipate learning any news tricks from this book, but it's well worth checking out if your journalistic beat is anything from astronomy to zoology by way of molecular architecture and quantum mechanics"
1,Field Guide for Science Writers who read with a microscope,"Was very excited to get reading my new paperback copy of ""A Field Guide for Science Writers."" However, I could not read it!The text is size 6 font and the chapter blurbs and excerpts are size 4 sans serif. Would be comical if I hadn't paid $20. Seems like a lot of people worked on this unreadable piece. I suspect the book says ""consider your audience"" and stuff like that, or maybe it doesn't, I will never know. I read 2 or 3 books a week, so I took a look at the last batch of things I have read to see if I was hallucinating, but alas, this book is the smallest font by about half...Hope I can get my money back.Seems a bit lazy to this writer and editor. Would not expect shabby design from a writer's organization.Maybe the hardback is better?"
3,Loved it until...,"Great concept, clever. Useful but the edging separated from the flap. Not a big deal, but surely expected it to last a lot longer for the price."
5,Great Buy for Three Great Movies,"If you are a Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd fan, this trio of movies is a great selection all wrapped up into one package. This is definitely a ""must buy"" for those who love movies of mystery, crime, suspense and drama. The title ""Edge of Your Seat Collection"" definitely met all of my expectations."
3,Worth a read,"Not the first book in the wonderful Book of Sword series I would suggest, if your alread in the series it keeps the story going. Previous books in the Lost Book of Swords are better, after reading I got the impression Fred Saberhagen was ready to finish off the series."
5,Ericsson Data Uplink Cable - Works Great,"This item arrived promptly in the mail and it works great. I can transfer MP3 Music and Sound files to use as Ringtones as well as listen to MP3 Music files just like a standard MP3 Player. I can create MP3 playlists from the files I transfer from my computer to the phone using this cable. With my headphones, this phone works just like an expensive MP3 Player. Thank you for this wonderful new cable.Sincerely - Robert J."
5,Works Great with my Sony Ericsson W300i,"The cable arrived quickly and works great with my W300i phone. I use it to transfer music, ringtones, games and themes to my phone from my computer.I also synchronized my phone address book with Outlook Express address book.I ordered it after another similarly (low) priced cable from a different vendor only worked sometimes and was slow. This one I had no problems with."
5,Help for Adult Women Obsessed with Body Image,"""The Body Myth"" written by clinical psychologist Margo Maine and Joe Kelly is a ground-breaking must-read for today's woman struggling to comply with the perfectionistic one-size-fits-all body image currently in vogue. Challenging that image as unrealistic and damaging, the authors provide information and inspiration along with exercises at the end of each chapter which serve as powerful tools to help free women from the dangerous addiction to striving for thinness. Jane Pailas-Kimball, Ph.D., psychotherapist"
2,somewhat????????,"I presume the video is an excellent video if you are able to view the video without interruptions? The video freezes,tiles,will not return to certain sections of the video without a malfunction and it is annoying."
3,Not for everyone,"This DVD is well produced with clear video. But,it is not for the beginner. Norm Duke is more of a straight line bowler. If you want to copy his style, he offers sound advice. There are too many shots of him hitting the pocket. We know he can bowl and that time could have been spent on basics like core size to rev rate ratios which would help in selecting the proper ball to fit your style, the proper sole material that would apply to various approach conditions, ball drilling, etc.I purchased my dvd at E-bay at a price that kept my disappointment to a minimum.For the beginner to intermediate bowlers, Bill ""Hall's Bowling At The Next Level"" will offer more practice drills and more basic information."
4,Great video,"Definitely the most informative video I have ever seen. I've been a league bowler for years and even had lessons by former PBA players. This will really help with fundamentals, set-ups, armswing, and almost everything you need to help improve your game. The only downfall is that it doesn't teach much about making adjustments for spares, oil breakdown, and oil carrydown. Overall fantastic video and by far the most informative learning tool for bowlers."
5,A must have!,"I liked this CD so much I got a copy for my friend and my brother. Don't be fooled, this is not the usual ""smoothjazz""(I use that term loosely), this CD reaches much deeper and paints a sonic pallet that is lush, vivid, rich and full from the first note to the last. It' a CD you will find yourself playing many times over, and not just a few cuts but the entire CD is truly very, very good. A sonic journey well worth taking. A must have IMO, which is a rating I rarely give out."
2,Broke after couple of months,I've been using the bazooka for 6 Months now and I have to say am very very disappointing. The bazooka have broken on me 3 times already. At final I have send the bazooka back and request a refund. The bazooka just doesn't hold the power. Maybe with a factory radio and low volume on the music might work fine. But I listen to loud music. And my radio is after market (Pioneer). So this is just not for me. For those of you who are looking for a powerful sub woofer. THIS IS NOT THE ONE.
3,"Bazooka 10"" Sub Cracked","I bought this sub for my girlfriends car. It worked great and sounded pretty good at first. About two months later, we kept hearing bad rattleing from the car. I thought it was a car component ratteling, but after a long search it turned out to be the sub enclosure. The whole back of the tube, where the amp mounts, has cracked amost all the way around. It is a bazooka amp, so there is no chance of there being to much power for the sub. Its still under warranty, so lets hope that bazooka will replace it. Good sub, but seems a little bit cheap."
4,Good for money,"For the money, it's a good product. Does it blow you out of the car, no, it's not that powerful, but for those who want good clean bass to supplement a decent factory, or aftermarket head unit, it's a good choice. Installation was pretty easy, and only requires a basic knowledge of hand tools/auto skills. To get the best performance you do need to either run the system with the high level inputs, or have at least 4V Preouts on your head unit, or you will not get good gain, and reduced volume will result. This install was in a 3rd Generation 4Runner (1997 -2004), so it's pretty handy to be able to take it out as needed for cargo room. For the price on Amazon, it's a good buy, but I would not recommend it at retail (400+), you can get better performance with the 10"" unit and a separate amp."
5,Great Bass,"I love the way it improved the sound of my car. I installed it in my 1991 Nissan 300zx. It sounds great. If you are looking for a good quality bass in your car, and you already have a good quality stereo and speakers, this is a good product. It complements a good set of speakers when you need a little more of punch in your sound."
2,Already broken and needs service.,Very disappointed with the bazooka. It started to fade in and out and then finally stopped working. Hopfully will have no problems with customer service.
1,Disappointed: 2! Damaged Bazookas,"Ordered Bazooka. Item arrived in terrible condition. Box was far over sized for product. Screws fell out of subwoofer and it was cracked. Still went through hassle of trying to install. Did NOT work! Ordered second identical item which too was shipped in oversized box, not enough packaging and was damaged more than first one. Amplifier had fallen and was broken inside of subwoofer.Failure!and now we have hassle of taken these giant boxes back to UPS to return.I see that, currently, this item is under review and cannot be ordered. Good idea!Do not recommend this item being purchased via Amazon as their vendors are obviously not doing a decent job filling orders. Look elsewhere as this was just too much hassle."
1,Item Arrived broken would not power on,"Cheap painted outer surface finish, rattled inside, discovered only one plastic bracket supporting amplifier was broken, tested from amp terminals and showed power getting to amp, but would not power on. Even if it bumped, I was disappointed at the Chinese looking quality of this product right out of the box. Overpriced for the build quality. I would not recommend this product at this price."
2,Mediocre at best,"I wanted something to pump up my stock stereo a bit but after about a month I decided this just didn't cut it. You can get a 12"" sub in a box with an amp for the same price new or half that on Craigslist and have 10x the power that this thing does. I ended up doing just that and only spent $120. I'd recommend against this unit."
1,Not a good start,I just got the sub in today and already returned it. I picked it up and heard a rattleing sound so I tipped it over and out fell a screw from what I would say is the amp area. Then another fell out. They both look as if what ever they were screwed into turned brittle and just let them Strip them out. If the new exchange has any issues I am going to just return it and go with a different sub.
4,Adds just enough...,"Installed in 2006 4Runner cargo area. It rounds out the music very well at lower volumes. You can crank it up and have some decent bass. I used to run two JL 10s so this is a far cry from that, but then again, I'm 35 now with a 18 month old. I was looking for rich full music and this delivered exactly what I wanted. I only gave it four stars, not on performance, but on size. It's a tad bigger than I anticipated. I'm a happy camper though!"
1,not sure.,"my 10inch works awesome.I was impressed.so this time I ordered 10 inch 250 watt professional installed.250watt .. I was way too excited but, so disappointed again.the power is so weak, feel little more bass that was it.don't buy it. If you really like bazooka buy 10inch w/o power."
1,arrived broken,"Arrived busted in half; sent back for refund. I know some might not feel this is a fair rating, but maybe it will encourage the people at bazooka to safely package the product instead of throwing it in a box with a paper bag."
3,Disappointed!,"My 4 year old daughter picked this pool out at ToysRUs and was so excited. I got it home, blew it up and got out the hose. By the time I turned on the water, there was a BIG HOLE in the pool. Needless to say, there were a lot of tears that afternoon.We always buy inflatable pools and I have never had one get a hole this fast, I would not buy this product nor any other inflatable pools by this manufacturer."
5,Exceptional writing,"An exceptionally sensitive description of a culture which has disappeared. I felt privileged to read this book, which encourages a slow, respectful read."
4,Enjoyable read,"Don't be put off by the title as it doesn't do the story justice (it's not one of those stories where the hero is irresistible and knows it). While you might groan a bit at the character of the mother and sister, basically the hero and heroine make a delightful couple and it's a fun read. It's not of the same caliber as say, Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" but for light reading you'll enjoy it."
4,Love KR!,I have always enjoyed Karen Ranney and she doesn't disappoint in this book. I am reading all the books in this series and like them.
2,Reviews don't match book,"Surely, these reviews about a lesbian couple are not about Joan Hohl's book ""Never Say Never."" Hohl's book is comprised of two stories about ranchers, rich women, and their unhappy marriages. Not a GLB in sight. Where did these reviews come from? The ISBN of the book to which I'm referring is 1821763792, if you want to research the conflict further yourself.The rancher stories, by the way, are the type of story I hate. Cold men who are unkind to their women, who are devastated and who love the men anyway. Why do authors write this stuff which makes you feel bad?!"
2,Review of product,"I have had this game before and was replacing it. I found it to be technically defective, tempermental when playing such as suddenly skipping from one location to another. When placing some characters or objects, suddenly they just disappear after a minute or so. Very frustrating.The ""bonus"" Cleopatra game wouldn't even install. I am now ordering a new game out of frustration. I guess you get what you pay for. Do not order this from this company."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money, and by all means, don't follow his heavy weather advice, which is written as a fictional account of a small sailboat in a storm -- cutting loose a Jordan Series Drogue and surfing down massive waves a la Moitessier is just ridiculous. It has to be fictional because it's obvious Vigor never did it himself -- after all, he's still alive.Not only is his advice ridiculous, it's dangerous. Read works by real sailors like Hal Roth, Bernard Moitessier, Pete Goss, Richard Henderson, Beth Leonard, and Lin and Larry Pardey if you want to learn about sailing. Their recommendations are based on actual experience, not fictional accounts. But remember that many of their works were written before the Jordan Drogue was invented. So, for instance, just because Moitessier didn't mention it, doesn't mean he wouldn't recommend it today if he were still alive."
4,so far so good,no time to read all this stuff.......and give feed backs........so ha ha hah hahha hah ah ah ah ahah ah
3,Have some doubts,"I'm not 100% sure of the value of the book, most of the concepts are well known and of little importance for my point of view. In some arguments it lacks of depht..."
5,Excellent resource,A stellar insightful examination into what makes one boat more seaworthy than another.Offers a practical scoring system to rate boats in term of seaworthiness.In addition it is well written with wonderful anecdotes from the author as well as other sailors.For a sailor without much blue water cruising experience this book offers a life times worth of knowledge on boat design in regard to blue water cruising.
5,Excellent Nail File,"This is an excellent nail file. It does not tear your nails like other files. It leaves them nice & smooth. Love that it comes with a case, so I can carry it in my purse."
4,I love this file.,This file makes for very nice nails. Not sure how long it will hold up but love it for now.
4,Nail Tek Crystal File,This is a nice file that I keep by my favorite chair so if I have to use it it is close.
4,a good book... just a bit disappionted,"i love Charmed so i was thrilled when i bought ""the warren witches"". but i was a bit disappointed in some of the stories. i thought i was going to discover more about the charmed ones' ancestors... WITHOUT piper, phoebe and paige. but over-all, it was a good book- especialy for charmed obbsessed fans... like me."
3,Bought it and returned it,"Bought these pliers along withIrwin Industrial Tools 2078708 Slip Joint, Diagonal, Lineman, Adjustable Wrench and Groove Joint ProPliers Kitbag Set, 5-Piece. I returned both items.All of the pieces appeared to be good quality. The problem for me is the grip on the handles. It makes every one of the pliers, even the smaller ones, awkward to handle (at least for me). I would say I have pretty average hands for a guy, no conditions that would make it difficult to hold pliers.It must just be me, other reviews rant and rave about these pliers."
5,needle nose pliers,Nice quality tool for the money. I bought this and one of the 9's and the diagonal cutters also. good deal for all 3 of these tools. I think they should tell you where the tool is made in the tool description though since they are imported
1,Item not has advertised,I was disapointed with this jacket. It was advertized as cashmere. When I received it the label stated it was recycle cashmere and it did not look or feel like cashmere. I was very disappointed and I returned the item.
3,Definitely Wanton...,"In this book, the Horde capabilities and intelligence seem to be evolving. The Shikar warriors are dumbfounded and trying to figure out how it's happening. This book was alright, but it wasn't as good as Ravenous. It did have some funny parts though... 11 inches and as big as her wrist! I'd be scared too! LOL!. However the best part was when Steffy was dying. Okay, not the dying itself, but the emotions that poured out from Cinder. I love hardcore/bad boy heroes with a heart of gold. *sigh* LOL!"
3,Avoid Sold Out Software Version,"If you buy this (and it is a good game), and your copy was published by Sold Out Software, send it back immediately. Sold Out Software added an extra layer, and part of that layer is designed to destroy your computer if you have software they disagree with, such as Daemon Tools. If you don't mind that, because you think nobody uses Daemon Tools for anything but piracy, still avoid it because it partially deployed and messed me up part-way after I reformatted and installed without Daemon Tools. It is a good game, but you have to avoid Sold Out Software."
1,Amateurish,"The first problem with this book is the lack of Chinese characters making it virtually worthless for more advanced Chinese learners. Secondly the romanisation is not pinyin, nor any other recognisable system. Thirdly this should be entitled ""making out in Taiwanese"" as a good 20~30 percent of the phrases in the book would not be recognised by mainlanders.If you want a book on Chinese slang then get either 'Mutant Mandarin' or 'Outrageous Chinese' by James Wang (China Books, San Francisco) although these include a lot of liumang and Beijing punk slang that doesn't travel well, or Li Shu Juan's 'Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Slang in China' (ISBN 962-238-222-3, Hong Kong) the only failing of which is to not always distinguish Cantonese and Northern slang."
5,Good Information!,"Well, the book certainly provides what the title promises. I was not disappointed! Now to ""try it out"" in the world! Recommend this even for the purposes of getting a more ""real"" and useful vocabulary addition."
3,Drive90 worked well until...,"This attachment works well if you ignore the grinding noise from the mechanism. It will not make the noise if you hold it just so but it's difficult to do so. DO NOT be tempted use it with an impact driver. That's how I broke mine (stripped the mechanism) an impact driver is too much for the tool unless you dril pilot holes. For driving screws in low torque applications it does fine. If you are driving screws into hardwood with an impact driver and no pilot holes, be prepared to break it as this tool will not be able to handle the touque. I would only recommend this tool for occasional use."
1,Mistake in buying this product!,"This angle driver was a complete wast of my time and money!I purchased this product to drive wood screws into plywood on my boat. The driver broke on the first screw! I was using a #10x1 screw and driving into unfinished 5/8"" plywood!"
1,buy a right angle drill instead,"I bought one from Lowe's a year ago. Used it sparingly to screw and unscrew wood /drywall screws in tight spaces. After about two month later, the gears stripped. Definitely not worth your money."
1,Head stripped first time using.,Like the title says. The head started making a chatter noise upon using. It finally quit altogether. I guess you get what you pay for. I would not buy another one.
4,Good for light work.,I was hopping it was a bit more durable but at this low price it fits the need of doing light household work. I keep this item in the house because I do not think that it would hold up under shop conditions.
2,Nice for tight spaces but not well built,This product is very cheap and it broke the first time I used it. I was using it with a Makita 18V Drill to install cabinets. It was very handy but after some hard use I'm guessing the plastic gears started slipping making it unusable.
4,Saves time,"I'm a mechanic and I bought this for a particular job that I get ( cabin filters on new renault megane 3's). The job is done in less than half the time as the screws are dificult to reach . For light stuff it's great , I havent tried driling or tight srews or bolt yet but for what I do it's faultless."
1,Piece of junk,"Broke the first time I used it. First, one of the ball bearings fell out, then the entire mechanism failed. Do not buy this thing."
2,Pretty bad quality,"Do not buy this Kindle Edition: It has the quality of a poor photocopy. The text is almost indistinguishable. This is a nice book on Numerical Analysis, but please, stay away from this overpriced cheap photocopy."
5,What are the Tracks on this album?,"I'll gladly pay the money if this is the album with ""If the washing don't get you"" but how can you offer it 'blind'? please list the songs included. If it has the proper songs it is definitely a 5-star album."
1,disappointing fun,"My son was very excited to recieve this toy as a gift. After setting both sides up and changing into bathing suits,we turn on the water only to have it sooting all over. The blue side was shooting water all over where the gun attaches to the bunker and the orange side would not work at all. They were deflated and returned to the store. A very big disappointment!"
2,Battle Blaster Blowout,"These blasters are a lot of fun but they didn't last long. One fell over and the gun started leaking all over the place. It wasn't much fun for the person using that gun because the water was shooting everywhere but where he wanted it to go. These have the potential to be a lot of fun but should be re-made with better quality ""shooters"""
1,cutting plier,"figured I was getting a top quality tool. very disappointed, only used a couple of time and the cutting edge does not line up any longer. JUNK"
3,Slightly different patter,"I guess it never occurred to me that the pattern might be different - the leaves are a different shade of green and the green line around the outside is different as well. They don't seem as nice as my original ones, but I think only I would ever really notice."
5,High quality product.,"We ordered these plates to add to the service for eight set that we ordered, because we were so impressed with the quality of the original pieces. We were not disappointed. These plates are of a high quality level at a very affordable price. I would recommend this product to anyone."
3,Correlle Dinner Plates,"These plates aren't bad. However, I got them to match older ones of the same pattern that I already have and the design on the newer ones doesn't look as clear or detailed as the older Correlle Calloway prints."
3,Only order if you play Jazz,"If you play Jazz, or want to learn to play Jazz, this is a good volume to consider. It includes more than one treatment for some of the compositions, as well as commentary on the arrangers. However, if you are looking for more traditional arrangements this is not a book you'll want."
3,ever hear of consanants?,"Not on this album. This whole set would be fine if Van had simply gone through the trouble of more clearly pronouncing his vocals. Imho the reviewer who says Van's voice is in top form, and that the back-up singers ruin the songs is dead wrong. It's true that the backing vocals give some of the songs a gospel feel, but there is nothing wrong with gospel and at least those back ground singers knew how to pronounce the lyrics! Van's singing is annoying and disappointing. mike"
4,Poor Ol' Van,"If you've read the reviews for this album, you can see that it's either a love it/hate it thing. I borrowed the album from my uncle, listened to it, and decided not to return it. I actually like it. I'm not a huge Van Morrison fan, but I do like the sound of this album. I love the way the intro blends into ""dweller on the threshold."" The background singers are kinda wierd but it just adds to the uniqueness of the album. I find it very relaxing and often times I fall asleep to it at night. My suggestion is to buy it, you'll probably like it."
5,"a ""must have"" book for any climber","This book is an incredible resource for climbing gear. It's well laid out, easy to read, and full of useful information. If you're serious about your gear then you should own this book. It's the most read book in my ""climbing"" library."
3,Quite basic actually.,A very comprehensive book that unfortunately lacks any depth whatsoever. Besides due to the mag affiliation the author avoids to make direct reference to brands and models good or bad as this could anger advertisers. Good for beginers or to learn the basics of gear that you do not normally use.
5,every climber needs this book,This book explains the use and selection of all kinds of climbing and general outdoor gear. If you read this you can become better educatedd on what gear you really need and how to use it properly (safely).Includes one particular gem: Do NOT get eye surgery if you plan on real mountaineering. You can have severe vision problems at altitude. This led to Beck Wethers terrible Everest injuries.
2,Bad Caps Lock key,"I ordered this because I type a lot and my wrists are starting to hurt. Overall it's a pretty comfortable keyboard, seems like a little cheap construction so I'm not sure how long it would last. The keys are easy enough to type with, but this one came with a defective caps lock key. If i hit caps lock the keyboard quits working and I have to unplug it from the computer to reset it. Also I can't get any of the multimedia keys to function, and the lights for the caps lock/num lock don't light up. Overall, I'm returning it because I need the caps lock function. I used to have a microsoft ergo 4000 which I had no problems with. I also though it was a little bit more ergonomic with all the curves it has. I never had a problem with the space bar, so I'm going to order another one even though the amazon rating is only 3 stars. I'll hope I like it as well as I did the last one."
3,"Cheaper key construction, and non traditional layout is a no win in my book.","In my search for the right(tm) ergo keyboard for computer work, I own one of these models. What sells it? A lower price, a number of macro buttons, and an ergo shape. If you simply need a cheaper ergo keyboard, I suppose this will do. However, the rearrangement of the ""|\"" keys to accommodate a nonstandard large ""Return/Enter"" key was very unnecessary. Also, the function keys along with certain other main keys tend to get stuck during use. Not too big of a deal, but again, this is not the keyboard to use if you do development and expect keys to be in a certain place. For a business setting, this may be okay, but if you want one for personal/development use, this probably is not they keyboard to have."
5,My favorite,"I have done medical transcription for 30+ years and average 8-10 hours per day at my keyboard. I have gone through multiple designs and types of ergonomic keyboards over the years and so far this one is my favorite. Very comfortable to use, just enough ""click"" and a light touch. Highly recommended!"
4,Backspace key takes a sledge hammer to use,"I love this keyboard with this one exception. It takes a sledge hammer to use the backspace key. All the others are great, I actually like the keys on this keyboard better than Microsoft's ergo keyboard. I have tried to find a solution to the terrible backspace key, but to no avail. It's not enough for me to return this, but I sure wish it wasn't so hard to depress this one key. Sometimes I think I'm going to break my finger just trying to mash this key to go back whenever I make a mistake and unfortunately, I type so fast that I make a lot of mistakes! Would I recommend this keyboard to others? Absolutely. My keyboard is probably a fluke. If it weren't for this one issue, and the fact that Microsoft's version has a padded wrist rest, I would rate this one 5 stars."
2,"Stupid design, cheap construction","The keyboard has no flip down feet to elevate the front. The whole point of an ergonomic keyboard is to keep your wrists as straight as possible, but without the front elevated, your wrists must kink in order to type. Also the 's' key has a markedly different feel than the other keys, likely due to poor assembly. Lastly, the little rubber feet are just stickers and keep falling off. I regret buying this keyboard."
2,Did not last long,"I had this keyboard for a month, and now it is mistyping- missing letters, and repeating letters. There is no ryhme nor reason to when or how it messes up. Of course, I threw away the box so cannot return it. I would not recommend this keyboard."
4,Good for the price,"I wanted a reasonably priced ergonomic keyboard so I chose this one. Feel of this keyboard is alright: I've worked on better, but I am slowly getting used to this one too. They keys are a little mushy, but they are all exact and there are no blind spots that I noticed (some ergonomic keyboards have trouble with space key, this one has it split, so no such problems).I am using it with an iMac and volume keys and play/pause and stop work. I can't map Home and Favorites though, and ""power"", ""sleep"" and ""wake up"" don't work properly (they only show a dialog where you can choose an action, but not perform action itself).There are no kick stands in the back of the keyboard, but I don't find that to be a problem. The default height is good.Pros:- True ergonomic design- Normal arrow keys and insert/home/delete/etc. keys layout- Just the right amount of ""media"" keys.Cons:- Can't map all the keys on a Mac- Keys a bit mushy, but not terrible.- Cheap plastic feel, but not too bad."
2,"HUGE, causing conflicts w mouse, poor Keystroke feeling","I don't know why I bought this without seeing and trying it in person - based on positive reviews I guess. The thing is gigantic, so you have to move your hands around to reach keys you can normally reach with a finger extension. I could get used to the layout - hoped to in fact - but they the keys are difficult to press... AND it caused my wired mouse to lock up and perform strangely (selecting multiple items, unable to deselect). Also, one of the reasons I got it was for the media controls, which did not with my computer - a Windows 7 core 7 HP."
1,Don't go Adesso!!!,"do NOT waste your money on this product. Unfortunately, the keyboard/trackpad layout is great and I can't find it anywhere else, but that doesn't matter... I've purchased 4 of these keyboards and none of them has lasted more than 6 months. The shift key sticks on all of them, the mouse button stops working before long and one of them kept losing connection with the computer. Since I was in for four of them, I thought I'd try sending them back for warranty repair. They make you jump through all kinds of hoops, which I jumped through, then I mailed the first keyboard back to them AND THEY SAY THEY NEVER GOT IT! Completely unapologetic. It's crazy, but this manufacturer of an actual product behaves as if they are a silly scam company. Anyway, the product doesn't work, so don't waste your money. I am going to try buying a ergo keyboard and a separate track pad. Best of luck to you in finding the ergo solution that works for you."
5,Great Keyboard,"Received my new keyboard yesterday. What a relief! I had been forced to use a ""regular"" keyboard for a few days and the strain was considerable. My typing worsened immediately and my hands, shoulders and neck were all feeling the strain. This keyboard has addressed all of the above and more. It is a very sturdy keyboard and I love the built in wrist rest. It seems much better than my old Microsoft Elite keyboard. I love the feel of typing on it and I am getting used to the different sound typing makes on this unit. I was pleasantly surprised to find the extra keys functional. Not sure how much I will use them, at the moment the novelty is nice."
2,It's not Microsoft,"I bought the Adesso based on the reviews, to replace my Microsoft Natural 4000. They are very similar, but my the keys on the Adesso are ""scruntched"". What I mean by that is when resting on the home keys, my hands are slightly closer together- I'm talking only a tiny bit, but when you're used to certain movements, it makes it awkward. I prefer the Microsoft keyboard."
4,Great Ergonomic Keyboard,"This has been a great keyboard and I have little to complain about. I find the keyboard comfortable, didn't take much to adjust to, keys feel good (although I admit there aren't many keyboard that the keys really bother me), and it was priced right. The keyboard feels light and a little cheap but I don't think I'm ever going to have problems with that."
3,"Okay, but not good enough for me","I returned this keyboard shortly after taking delivery. While it works passably for a split keyboard, the keypress feel was just a bit mushy, and there was just a little too much flex in the keyboard. (You never think flex would matter in a keyboard until you use a stiff one and a wimpy one.) I'm a sysadmin, so 95% of my work involves typing, and this was to be my work keyboard. For people who aren't primarily keyboard-focused in their work, this is probably fine, but then again, most people looking at buying this are doing so because they use a keyboard all day.How I wish someone still made a split ergo keyboard like my old LiteOn model that had three steel plates in it! Still looking for something with the same quality. (And no, don't even bring up the mess that Microsoft sells.)"
4,Interesting stories,"As all the good stories books, this one has a strong message in each story that put you to think before you are going to do a ""bad"" think to anybody, because what you are doing to others it could reverse to you, good or bad things, these stories are to think about."
2,Completely average,"I've tried a lot of shampoos, and this one offers nothing different whatsoever. I have fine hair that's hard to style, and Mane 'n Tail shampoo/conditioner doesn't affect it whatsoever--no extra volume, thickness, shine, anything. This product is definitely overhyped."
2,"Dry, Non-Sulfate-Free, Chemicals In a Bottle","I Was so excited about getting this after hearing so many good reviews about it on YouTube. I got it at my local beauty store and got it for $10, also alone with the conditioner :). I was thinking all the time i was using it ""wow this is going to make my hair grow and healthier"" WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! I Was totally wrong! After about 2 uses, My hair felt SOO dry after washing my hair. I Love the conditioner but it just wasnt giving my hair the moisture it needed to cover up the dryness from the shampoo. I know you guys dont wanna hear m talk negative but dont get your hopes up if your African American (I Am). Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the second ingredient on the bottle. Make sure you put some good moisture in your hair before using this product."
2,Did not work.,"I got this product because I was tired of being a human. I thought life would be a little easier if I was a horse...but...nay... it very unfortunately did not turn me into a horse. As you can see, I'm clearly able to type...which, I imagine most horses can't do. I think I need to reign in my expectations. I'm going to saddle up for a trip to Petsmart look for monkey shampoo or something. Maybe I'll have more luck then."
2,Not For Those With Chemically-Treated Hair!,"After reading rave reviews online, I decided to give Mane N Tail a try and was sorely disappointed. My hair is permed and using both the shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling dry, trashy and riddled with split ends. I think this shampoo is better suited for people with hair that has not been weakened by relaxers as the shampoo strips your hair of any essential oil and moisture. Chemically-treated hair requires a fortifying shampoo that will strengthen the hair shaft and this shampoo does not do that!"
3,um its okay,"this shampoo is okay i have african american hair and its good as a shampoo but is drying when you rinse it out they should add more moisture to it. other than that rinsing factor its fine and the smell is decent, i heard it makes your hair gro too, i might just add some olive oil to it and see how that works and post it up. olive oil is moustirizing but as for the seller my bottle had spilled and wasnt taped properly so ill buy it from the store. I wont order from USA medicals again, i promise that."
1,WORST SHAMPOO EVER,"I don't see how anybody could possibly ever love this shampoo or conditioner. I usually have smooth hair when I use Aussie. I decided to try something new because I had heard about how amazing this shampoo was, but now I am regretting it. My hair is really tangly and coarse. I've used it three times hoping that it would be better as I used it, but I will honestly never use this again. I know it's not a fluke because my sister has also used it, and had the same opinion on it as i do. I would NOT suggest this to anybody. My hair feels HORRIBLE."
1,Not for Me,"I was happy with my shampoo and my hair was healthy, but I decided to give Mane 'n Tail a try because I heard someone raving about how thick and wonderful it made their hair. Wow. Apparently this shampoo does not have the same effect on everyone. I tried this once and will never use it again. It turned my hair into straw. After a hot oil treatment and subsequent conditioners, my hair is s-l-o-w-l-y returning to normal. Wish I had left this product at the store. Am afraid to give it to someone else for fear it will have the same effect."
4,Fun Workout,"This is a fun workout. I have no dance background but found the moves easy to follow. As a beginner, my moves aren't as quick or as smooth as Julianne's but I still get a great workout. She starts with a warm up (5min) then goes through three routines, cha cha, jive, and paso doble (10min ea), then ends with a cool down (5min). She teaches some of the moves she actually teaches her dance partners on DWTS. The three dances are great, just wish she would have also had the samba."
4,"Good, But Could Be Better","I was so excited when I saw that Julianne had a Dance DVD out and so I bought it. I have to say I had a fun time dancing with her, but, this could have been done better. I own other Dance DVDs and they have better instructions than she does. Core Rhythms is better at explaining and slowly walking through the moves so you feel comfortable doing them and then they speed up the motion. The instruction part shouldn't be seperate on the video it should be part of the workout. She only does a quick show and then it's on to the movement. I felt clumsy and that was not good. I do have to say that I am ""drenched"" just like the reviews said I would. My heart rate was up, and she really is so cute and makes you smile. So get ready, pay close attention and have fun swaying your hips!!"
2,Beginners beware!,"If you don't know how to dance...don't do it! I truly have no idea or any education of any ballroom dancing and this workout did not help with that. I think everyone loves to ""dance,"" but this is truly dance. I thought it would be something fun and different but this workout is very fast-paced with little instruction on the moves. It is definitely for someone with advanced knowledge of dance moves. Tried it once and now it's sitting on the shelf!"
1,Disappointed,This DVD is definitely NOT geared toward beginners and should state so. Julianne's moves were exhausting to the point where even she comments on how out of breath and tired she is. Wish I could get my $$$ back. :o(
2,Disappointed,"I love Julianne which is why I bought this DVD. I love to dance and thought it would be fun to workout mixed with dance. I danced for many years as a girl, however, I had much difficulty following her dance moves. I don't consider myself to be uncoordinated, and have never really had a problem following a routine, but this one didn't work for me. It lacked instruction, moved very fast and I found myself frustrated in short order. Julianne is an incredibly talented dancer, but I wish I would have left this one on the shelf."
4,FUN,"This DVD is a blast! It is very fun, but it was HARD. The good news is it was so fun I didnt care how hard it was. I bought another one for my best friend."
4,Awesome and fun workout!,"I really enjoy this tape. The workout is energetic and fun, and I sweat a ton! I definitely recommend doing the private dance lesson first; it really makes it easier to keep up with the pace of the dances. I only wish the workout was a little longer. I frequently repeat segments to lengthen the workout."
3,Meh,"I thought this was kind of lame. A little goofy too. There was really nothing in here that got my heart rate up and really no dance move that I'll use in public. Julianne is adorable, and that's the best thing I can say. It wasn't too bad a mistake since I got it for $4.99, but I doubt I'll ever do this routine again."
3,Video,Good video but a little hard to follow; fast presentation then on to the video right away. Good workout though
4,Love it!,"I love this workout. Normally I stay away from dancy workouts and stick to kickboxing but this is fun and definitely gets your heart rate up. Also, the choreography makes you use your brain a little more than typical workouts so... maybe, hopefully it burns a few more calories. I would definitely recommend it, the workout is a good length- between 30-45 minutes of good cardio. It also has a great warm up and cool down which, in my opinion make it a little better than the Dancing with the Stars dvds."
3,Could be Better with one Small Improvement,"I can't for the life of me understand why professional dancers can't grasp the concept that they need to break down the steps with their back to the camera while making an instructional DVD. If only Julianne would have done this, especially in the private dance lesson chapter, it would save hours of frustration for new students of these dance styles. After all, in ""live"" dance classes, the instructor will usually face the mirror with her back to the class. To be fair, she's not the only one who's made this mistake. I've purchased many dance DVDs with the instructors facing the camera THE WHOLE TIME. Spent hours with my back to the tv looking over my shoulder to learn the steps. Most of the time I don't even bother and just toss the DVD aside and waste money. This one will go the same way I'm afraid. Three stars because I guess you could learn the dances eventually."
5,A ton of fun!,This DVD is great fun. I was smiling all the way through yet definitely felt it was a challenging workout. The fast pace gets the heart rate up in the first two dances and the paso squeezes in some toning of the legs and core with the tension in the moves. I exercise regularly but am always looking for something new that will keep me motivated....this hit the spot! I hope she makes another one.
4,Not for beginners but i loved it,"Beginners might have a little bit of a hard time with this dvd as it moves extremely fast. I am a beginner and i love this video because it gives you a challenge, something to strive for. Julianne definitely motivates you to keep going and keeps it fun. You don't have to do the moves perfectly to get a good workout, believe me you are sweating like a pig when you are done. Overall I give this dvd 4 stars only b/c it was difficult to get the moves, I still can't do one routine without messing up somewhere but its fun and keeps me smiling the whole time. Good job Julianne."
3,underwhelmed and confusing,While I love the idea for this DVD I was underwhelmed and confused. I personally am a dancer so i thought that i would be able to follow along fine. However that ended up not being the case Juliane is fun and entertaining to watch but her instructions were not very clear or that's how it felt to me.I even did the bonus section first to see if that would clarify things but it didn't.I love the concept and you do get a work out if you can figure out what she wants from you but all in all it was underwhelming.
2,disappointed,"I didn't watch more than 5 minutes of it because the hip thrusts hurt my back, and it bothered me that she was talking the entire time. The music was very poor (background house beats, no lyrics, no songs you know). This video is for people who don't really like to dance but desperately need a workout, have NO dance experience (i.e. not even going to clubs). It's for people who are doing the dance for the sole purpose of ""working out"" instead of enjoying the process. In short.. I wish I didn't buy it."
5,Fast and Efficient,"The product came very quickly because I was in the state that they shipped from. No scratches on DVD, and it looked brand new."
4,Too Many Close-Ups,"I was looking for a new kind of workout to try, but one that would really help me break a sweat since I am more than just a beginner. Julianne's Cardio Ballroom definitely makes me break a sweat and gives a fun workout, though I would supplement the DVD with other exercises. The only issue I have with the workout is that the camera man does too many close-ups of Julianne's face when he should either be panning out or focusing on her feet so you can learn the dance moves. I got frustrated at one point because every time she would instruct you to watch what she was doing the camera guy decided that would be a perfect time for a close-up shot. So, other than the terrible camera work, it's a good workout DVD."
5,so fun!!,"impulse bought the dvd in the middle of the night because i saw it advertised on television and i totally LOVE it!!!!! julianne is totally cute and motivating and i get a great workout from it. i work out about 4 times a week so i was worried it would be too easy and i wouldn't work up a sweat. On the other hand i was worried that since i have absolutely NO dance background, that i couldn't pick up the steps and would get totally frustrated by it and never do it. i've had the video for about a month and will use it about twice a week and i haven't gotten bored by it at all. also, you can make it more challenging for yourself by just doing the moves bigger, and with more feeling, and really feel like a dancer! buy it!"
4,Julianne DVD,"Did the cardio ballroom video and it is fast paced, good for intermediate or advanced dancers. Still liked it, but will have to workout with it more to get in line with with moves."
4,Way to make me sweat!,This is great! It makes me sweat and its a lot of fun. She is a little hard to keep up with at first but once you get the steps down its okay. I would recommend this to anyone looking to have a fun workout in the comfort of their own home.
1,Not for beginners,"If you are a beginner to dancing this video is terrible and impossible. If you don't have a great deal of dancing experience it is way too fast paced. She gives you some ""tips"" but shows you the moves a few times then goes up to tempo and you have no prayer if you're not a dancer.I'm upset I wasted my money"
2,"Oh man, I so wanted to love this!!","Unless you are a former dancer, or an extremely quick, agile and coordinated person, do not even think about trying this DVD. I made it through about the first 20 minutes then had to quit because my knees started to hurt in a bad way. Julianne is gorgeous and it's clear she loves to dance and teach others to dance, but I'm not dance-oriented and bought this based on the good reviews. So, to eBay this DVD goes, and back to my Jackie Warner DVDs I go."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Julianne is adorable, but this workout is pretty bad. The choreography is choppy, disjointed and not at all fun. I really wanted to love this, but was so disappointed in this video."
2,Tough to Follow,"I love Julianne but this video is really tough. I have no dance background and I couldn't even make it through the one-on-one lesson before I got frustrated and gave the video to my sister (who is also frustrated!). I suppose if I gave it a couple weeks of just trying to learn the moves, I might pick it up but I want to work-out and not just stand there shuffling my feet. Like I said, Julianne is cute and upbeat but even that didn't help me keep my cool while trying to learn the moves."
2,It is Okay,"This DVD is okay....but I wish I didn't buy it. Some of the moves are difficult, and Julianne faces you so it is really hard to follow to steps. In most classes, the instructor has his/her back towards you so you can mirror the movements...with this is all opposite and tricky...And, I didn't really get out of breath - except for the Jive! That one is good....other than that, not that great. But! Julianne is so perfect looking that watching the DVD does keep me motivated to continue working out - so that is good :)"
3,"Won't tone me up, but gets you moving","Disclaimer - I have a heavy background in jazz and ballet dancing.She basically teaches you three combinations - Cha-Cha, Jive, & Paso Doble.I'm worried that after 3 or 4 times (I've only done it once), I will get bored because I'll already know the combo, and she teaches it one 8-count at a time. You repeat the 8-count several times in a row, she adds on another 8 count, then you put it together. Some of the moves require a lot of coordination!It's fun to learn and practice some of the social dancing moves you see on ""Dancing with the Stars"", and she certainly has a body that motivates you to work out and try to look like her. But honestly, this did not get me sweating enough to be worth the 40 minutes. After 40 minutes of working out, I should be sweaty and sore. That didn't happen. However, this would be a great beginner workout for someone with good coordination but is out of shape. Too bad, because she was my favorite on the show."
2,Not for the uncoordinated,"I love Julianne. And I'd love to look like her. For starters, I have no dance experience nor do I have any coordination. THAT is on me, not the DVD. HOWEVER, I found this DVD to be very fast paced and confusing. There is not enough of a slow breakdown showing the progression of the moves. She does it slow once or twice, without any detailed breakdown, then does it fast while combining other moves. I cannot follow it and cannot see how someone of no dancing background could follow it.I gave it 2 stars because if you say the heck with it and keep trying, you will get a workout. But honestly, with the pace that she goes at, it is a discouraging workout video. So unless you are a good dancer or actually wanting to learn to dance (aside from the workout aspect), save your money and dance to the radio! What matters is that you are moving, not that your side-steps are perfect and up to speed with her. If I'm going to look dumb, I'd like to be having fun!"
2,stop changing the camera angle!!!,This was very hard to follow and the camera angle kept changing every few seconds and that made it even more difficult.If this is supposed to be about exercise while dancing shouldn't they focus on her legs and not her face? I wish I would have read more reviews before purchasing this.
3,uh not so impressed,"Im a pretty fit girl that loves exercising and trying new things out. This workout wasn't much fun but not so bad. The steps were hard to get on the first try, and i haven't tried it ever since"
3,Cardio Aint Kiddin',"I own a lot of workout dvds that are ""cardio"" workouts. All get my heart rate up, but NOTHING like this workout! Julianne is a lovely instructor and in the one-on-one explains the moves well. During the workout it isn't so clear, as she goes very fast.There is lots of jumping and kicking, and it promises to kick your butt. I found it of average difficulty, but I definitely enjoyed it! It is a good workout if you've done cardio or dance routines before. For a beginner it might leave you feeling frantic."
3,Too difficult for me,It was too difficult for me to catch on to the first time so now I'm not interested. Maybe if you are really motivated and keep trying or if you have dance experience it would be fine.
3,Tough but fun,"I am pretty uncoordinated, so suffice to say I had trouble following the routines even after the ""private lesson"". The music is more bearable than most workout DVD's, the environment, photography and set is nice and the girls do great. Julianne is gorgeous and definitely easy to watch..but I ended up doing more watching than dancing/working out. I think if I put a good bit of effort into it, I can eventually do well, but not great with this DVD. I just jumped around when I couldn't follow the moves. I don't mind the money I spent, b/c honestly once or twice at the Gym would cost as much- and at least I got a decent little sweat in. So it's up to the consumer whether it ends up being worth the money or not. It was hard to follow, but fun in its way."
3,NOT for people who can't dance... at all!,"I believe the people who have reviewed this to say you get a good workout, but for someone like myself who has almost no rhythm/can't dance, this DVD can be extremely frustrating. I started this DVD at the end of January and I'm still getting through the part designed to teach the dance steps BEFORE the actual workout. At one point I decided to skip it and go right to the workout... nope! not happening! It's too bad because I really do enjoy dancing in place of the regular aerobic videos and have had better luck with the Pussycat Dolls Workout DVD."
4,I sweat more doing this than when I use the treadmill or elliptical!,"I bought this because I wanted something that I could do at home on the days that I didn't feel like getting around and going to the gym. I've used work out dvds like P90X before for a VERY short while because it was a little too intense for me. I wasn't looking to kill myself every time I wanted to workout. I've never used a dance themed work out dvd though, but have always wanted to try it because, as others have said, you don't think about the fact that you're actually working out and getting exercise because you're DANCING! Although, I still will be going to my gym to work out, I will definitely be incorporating this into my regime for the simple fact that it is fun, provides a workout at home and I sweat WAY more in 38 minutes of ""Cardio Ballroom"" than I do in 38 minutes on the treadmill or elliptical! So, I would suggest buying it!"
2,She's pretty in the video but the moves are not do-able!,"Julianne looks good in the video but it's really hard to follow her moves because she's facing you and you are facing her so it's hard to follow. I did not break a sweat, although I feel motivated to lose weight just seeing her so I'm giving it a 2 stars. Overall, I viewed this video a couple of times only and never bothered after that, felt like it's a waste of time. I'd rather watch a youtube video like zumba, def a workout!"
3,cardio ballroom,"I was so excited to get this workout video because I love dance & am a fan of Julianne, however, I am still having a rough time with this video. If I could actually keep up with her, I'm sure I'd get a great workout. Some of the moves are quite fast, & if I get behind, I get lost. I feel this video is for someone who can commit to it every day & get the moves down. Because I do a variety of workout routines, I only put this video in once or twice a week, & it will likely get shelved in the future."
2,Dance Teacher?,The overall cardio on this dvd is good for the average person. The dancing is fun and keeps me going and interested. The problem is that most of the time you have to watch and rewatch Julianne do the dance steps because she doesn't give clear directions. Growing up with a dance background I was expecting 8 count instructions. You are lucky if you get left and right instructions!
2,Grr,"So before I bought this I was told ""anyone"" can do this workout. And let me tell you, they can't. I'm a little chubby, therefore just going into all of these difficult dance moves right off the bat is ridiculous for me. I'd suggest this to people who already have a knowledge of dance and can move at a super fast pace."
4,"Good workout, fast-paced","Anyone starting this workout DVD should go through the ""Private Dance Lesson"" one or two times before starting the actual workout. During the workout, Julianne goes through the steps too quickly to catch on a first run-through.However, this fast-paced nature of the workout makes it great for the longer haul. I've used it several times and the steps are coming easier and easier. Plus, I'm not bogged down by too much instruction now that I know what I'm doing.It is a good workout. After a coouple of weeks I, at least, am starting to see results.Really, I think the Private Dance lesson should be a bit longer and more detailed. That's the only reason I did not give this 5 stars."
1,Terrible camera angles!,"This is supposed to be an exercise video. If you know nothing about the dance moves, you buy this to learn and to exercise. The camera angles on this DVD are changed every 2-5 seconds, and 75% of the time they are shooting Julianne's face. How can you learn the moves if you're looking at her face? They shot this like it was a music video, not an exercise video."
4,"Leaves You Tired, Frustrated and Wanting to Try Harder!","I am not a dancer, and I've been out of the work-out game for a while. I got this DVD because I love watching dance, and thought it might be a more motivational way to get me moving again. The steps are not hard to follow so much as they are FAST. I wish her back was facing the front, so I could watch the correct feet and follow them better. I probably look ridiculous doing this workout, but who cares! It's in the comfort of my own home and it leaves me sore and tired. I can pause it when I need to, in order to get the steps down, or do them the best I can, and it's much more fun than running!"
3,Too Fast,"I like Julianne but she teaches the moves to quickly. She keeps saying she is feeling the burn. Well if she is feeling the burn, what hope do the rest of us have who are super out of shape?"
2,Julianne Cardio Ballroom,"Not good for beginners, the steps are too fast and Julianne is facing you so you're getting a mirror image which is hard to learn. The video keeps focusing on her face and not enough on the legs and steps. If you know the basic moves already it should be a fun workout."
5,Fun!,"I really like this video! Julianne goes over the steps slow enough so you can learn them, but not too slow that you are bored. Its fun and also a pretty good work out - I am usually a little sweaty after doing all 3 dances."
2,A little boring,"Great for exercise, but a little boring. I would buy this if you are young and able and can really get these challenging routines. If you are older, it lacks fun."
2,Not very fun,"Of all the dance work outs I've done, this is probably the most boring. Better off going w Taebo or Zumba."
2,Not sure yet,"I have only tried it once. I love Julianne since Dancing. Kind of hard to follow, but I'm going to keep working on it."
4,good start,It is nice to be able to learn the steps at your own speed before doing the whole dance exercise
2,Very hard to follow,It is very hard to follow. Very frustrating. If you have a dance background it might help understand it better.
4,A good sweat!,"I bought this item 'cause I wanted to try something new and i read a couple of reviews and decided to give it a try. I didn't think of it much the first time I did it because she goes really fast and it's a bit hard to keep up. I definitely recommend watching the tutorial for the dance moves. From the second time forward, it is a really great cardio workout! I love all the techniques she uses. I have a bit of dance background, which helps a lot. If you're coordinated and like ballroom, this is for you."
3,Dance video,"This video seems really fun and Julianne is super cute, but I tried it one day and it couldn't spark enough interest in me. I stopped it like twenty minutes in. It's not that I was lazy, because I work out all the time, I guess I'm not a dancer?"
1,Not impressed...,"I don't have much dancing experience at all, but thought i'd try this as it said that you would be able to easily catch onto the moves, etc... The 12 minute training session is not really that helpful and she goes way too fast. It's difficult to follow and i found that a lot of the video did not focus on her whole body, it would focus on her upper body, while you were supposed to be doing complicated movements with your legs, so i'd get lost! I did Zumba and really enjoyed it, a good workout and very clear instructions, much better than this!!!"
2,Poor camera angle/editing,"I like Julianne's teaching style and would have given this a much better review except for two things which make it hard for me to use this video, camera angle and closeups. First, if a teacher is going to use mirror image teaching, the camera needs to stay in front of her. I get confused when I'm following in mirror style, then the camera switches to a side angle where she is clearly stepping right but saying left. I am not very co-ordinated and this really throws me. Second, I do not need close in shots of her chest and smiling face while I'm trying to follow her foot work. This video frequently moves in tight and b/c she goes really fast, with fast footwork, I'd like to see her feet. I paid less than $5 and got free shipping with amazon prime, so I'll keep the video and struggle until I get it, but I would be returning it if I'd paid more."
2,Julianne's cute but not a physical trainer,"Julianne is an awesome ballroom dancer, she danced in world ballroom and latin dance competitions as a junior and teen. She even won Dancing With the Stars, twice. Trying to combine her dancing knowledge into a workout routine was a great idea and so I bought the DVD - but - there was no way I could follow Julianne. She would show what to me was a complicated dance step once and then expect you to get it right immediately as she moved on adding more steps. Nada. The DVD is collecting dust on my shelf and until I find someone better, I'm back to my favorites Tamilee Webb and Jillian Michaels."
2,difficult and all over the place,"Even with the private dance lesson segment this DVD is really hard to follow. Julianne Hough doesn't give enough practice time or instruction with the moves and jumps into the dances too fast. Unless you have a background in ballroom dancing, I'd pass up this DVD. It's more trouble than it's worth."
5,Great for all ages!,"I'm 51 years old and I could follow this workout. I am in pretty good shape but I didn't think I could do a dance workout. At first I was stumbling around trying to keep up. I usually do a step workout or weights. The trick is to keep coming back. After about the 4th time I was getting through it doing some version of the moves, almost right. Now I alternate doing step one day, Julianne the next so I get in three a week and the moves actually look good and feel strong. She's a great exercise teacher. Being a great dancer is one thing, being able to teach is another and she is right up there with the best in the business. She's so talented for one so young. Great job and I hope she does another one. I'll be first in line."
2,Your run of the mill dance video,I certainly did not think there was anything special about this DVD. If you have a dance workout video somewhere in your house then you pretty much have this one. I think I probably bought this because Julianne has such an amazing body on the cover. Good marketing but not a great product.
2,Ain't Got No Rhythm,"Oh my goodness, I had a terrible time trying to follow this tape. I am not a good dancer, though, so that is probably why. If you have had dance experience, this may be the one for you, but I sincerely struggled. Julianne is a wonderful teacher, but I am going back to my aerobics tapes!"
5,FUN!!,"This is a fun workout DVD. I have been a dancer for years and can say that this is more workout than dance, but it's a lot of fun, regardless. If you're looking for pure dance instruction, there are better DVDs to get. For a fun workout, this really can't be beat though. It's something that you'll enjoy doing again and again, which is important for staying motivated and seeing real results from your efforts. Worth the price for me!"
5,great fun workout!,"loved and enjoyed every second of my panting. julianne's perfect body that she puts on display is only further motivation to try harder. it's fun, and you feel great. i definitely recommend this one!"
2,Too Fast,"I agree with the reviewers who say that the dances are too fast for beginners. Even when she says she is doing the steps slowly they are still pretty fast to learn. And, I also agree with the reviewers who say the camera spends too much time on her upper body versus her legs and feet. Why not pull back and show all so you can see both the leg and arm movements. That would make it easier to follow. This video may be good for young people and people with dance background but not for me."
3,Promising,This would be a great product if you can get the dance steps down. The steps lesson given on the dvd is pretty good but confusing enough to make it difficult to do the workout will full benefit.
2,Eh,"I've used this once and that was enough. Unless you are a dancer, this will be frustrating and embarrassing. I have no rhythm and this DVD only proved it. You also need a ton of space to do these moves. I am an athletic, petite 26 year old, but this was ridiculously hard for me. Waste of 10 bucks."
3,It's ok,"This video is ok...I was expecting more. I love Julianne, but I think this video is just ok. The jive is extremely fast- hard to keep up, but I am also on carpet in my living room, so that adds a different component. Definately works you out, but it is frustrating because of the speed of the jive."
3,Not great for beginners,You should really have some experience in the dance moves.. This is not a great video for beginners learning. The one-on-one instruction really helps tho. I'm glad I didn't spend over 20.00 at Target or Walmart for this.
4,"great routines, quite a good workout","I would consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness and some of the routines were really challenging. Actually worked up a pretty serious sweat which has never happened with a dance workout.My major complaint with this is that, for myself, the best way for me to learn any semi-complex routine (more complex than the moves done in any typical exercise DVD that can be copied with barely any thought) is to see the instructor's back and be able to see their front via a mirror (sort of the way a dance class usually has a mirror on one wall.) I'm sure they could figure out a way to angle the camera to catch the mirror image just right or put a different camera angle in a box on the corner of the screen or something.That said, this is one of the best routines I've ever done with a dance workout and Julianne is a great instructor."
3,Good just hard to follow and I have dance experience..,gets you sweating in the first 15 min. moves are not easy to follow especially if you dont have dance experience.
3,It's OK,I only tried it for about 15 minutes because it was taking too long to get to the dancing part. It just wasn't fun.
5,i loved it!,"this was the first Nora Roberts book that i'd read and i wasn't disappointed! it was great. i have a surprising attraction to things about thieves, and Adrianne and Philip didn't let me down! i liked the chemistry between them. adrianne annoyed me sometimes, but protagonists do that sometimes. anyway, it was a very good book and deserved every one of its five stars"
4,Sweet Revenge...Sweet Book,"I usually only read historical romance but when a friend gave me this book I was hesitant to read it. But, once I started I couldn't put it down. This was my first Nora Roberts book and it was delightful. It tells the story of Princess Adrianne who has been planning all her life to steal back a necklace, The Sun & The Moon, to get (as the title says) sweet revenge on her father who she absolutely hates for the painful and slow death he caused her mother. But all her plans get interupted when Phillip Chamberlain enters Adriannes life and uncovers her deepest darkest secrets. The book kinda has a James Bond feel to it since Phillip & Adrianne are master theives and plan to do the last and biggest job of their 'criminal' careers. The only thing I didn't like is that the sex scenes are very brief and much is left to the imagination-they just leave you hanging. But, overall its a worth while read that will keep you on your toes till the very last page."
5,One of her best,"this is one of her best books, this will definitely be a favourite of mine. If your a Nora Roberts fan then this is a must read."
3,I expected more.,"My friend raved about this book, so I ordered it. As I read it, I kept waiting for the exciting part. I read tons of books, and the plot of this one didn't impress me."
5,This book is amazing - it has it all!,"Exotic setting, emotionally charged storylines, mystery, family dynamics, and a beautiful story of soulmates joining forces and finding true love. All are described in amazing detail, so the reader can not only visualize it, but experience it with all the senses - hear the sounds, smell the aromas, feel the touches, taste the delicacies!I cannot find the words to express how spellbound I was by this story! It was a page-turner that I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to read because I simply couldn't put it down for the evening. It definitely rates as one of the best books I've read all year."
1,boring...,"This book started out fast and then died. I kept wanting to skip to the end to see how it turned out, but eventually I gave up and it's been sitting on my bookshelf ever since. It was more of a mystery novel than a romance. I read at least half the book and the romance still didn't happen. Did the heroine ever actually meet the detective? Was that the romance part of the book? It kept dragging and dragging and dragging. I kept saying to myself, ""When are they going to meet each other?"" The half of the book I did read only had about 2 scenes with the detective. The rest of it was yada, yada, yada about the mother and her problems with life. It was nothing about the heroine. Only a diehard Nora fan is going to give this book a 4 or 5 star."
1,"Typical, Eurocentric Stereotypes About Muslims","I couldn't read past the second chapter. Roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about Muslims. It really steamed me that she used a verse of the Quran out of context for the title page of ""The Bitter"". ""Your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like"" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the Quran. I'm not going to finish this book, because I'd rather not be reminded of how much I am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed ""other"" type of woman, thanks."
3,Just ok,Wasn't one of Nora's best books ever. Was kind of hard to follow some things because of different language. Would have been nice to have a glossary. But still a Nora book so worth reading.
1,THE WORST,"THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF THE WORST I HAVE EVER READ! THERE'S RAPE, ATTEMPTED RAPE OF A YOUNG GIRL, DRUGS, AND DEPRESSION. BESIDES THAT IT'S BORING AT TIMES, AND NEVER EXPLAINS HOW ADRIENNE LEARNED HOW TO STEAL. ALSO, NORA ROBERTS WOULD REPEAT INFORMATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS THOUGH SHE WERE JUST TRYING TO TAKE UP SPACE. THE BOOK LEFT ME DEPRESSED AND VERY DISAPPOINTED. I'M GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT, BUT I WISH I HADN'T READ IT. I HAVE READ OTHER BOOKS BY NORA ROBERTS, AND HAVE LIKED ALL OF THEM UP TILL NOW. IF YOU WANT A GREAT BOOK OF HERS TRY ""JEWELS OF THE SUN."" I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK OF THAT SET."
1,She didn't live up to the hype!,"I bought this book on a whim at the grocery store because a good friend of mine loves her books. What a waste of $8.00! Between the blurb on the back of the book, the blurb inside the front cover, and the first two chapters, I figured out how the story ended and completely lost interest in finishing it. I realize this book was released 18 years ago, but I have no interest in seeing if her writing has improved over time. She just didn't live up to the hype!"
2,FROM THE HAREM TO NY CITY,"I AM A HUGE NORA ROBERTS FAN. HOWEVER, FOR THE FIRST TIME I AM DISAPPOINTED. ROBERTS SHOWS WHAT IT IS REALLY LIKE LIVING INSIDE A HAREM. IF YOU LIKE BOOKS WITH HAREMS IN THEM THEN YOU WOULD LIKE THIS ONE. SHE DID EXCELLENT FIELD WORK ON IT. I FINISHED READING IT ONLY BECAUSE ROBERTS WROTE IT. THE AMERICAN PARTS I ENJOYED THOROUGHLY"
4,The story was captivating,"This was my first Kindle Fire download. I loved the story and could not lay it down. I have been a Nora Roberts fan for a number of years. My criticism of this book is regarding the spelling and grammar. Having read so many Nora Roberts books I had never encountered errors of this kind before. It made me wonder who edited her book and how it came about that such errors went unnoticed and I cannot believe the errors were hers. After I got to ten errors, I quit counting them. Is this a glitch in the Kindle Fire system? I paid for this book. I am skeptical about getting anymore if I have to deal with spelling and grammar errors. If anyone can enlighten me, I would surely appreciate it.Thanks.mjcardillo@gmail.com"
4,very exciting,I really enjoyed this book by Nora Roberts. I was entertained for 3 days reading it. I was surprised with the ending though but all and all it was very exciting.
4,Attention: this rating is based on a Nora Roberts scale!,"I have to admit that I go back to Nora from time to time when I am looking for purely mindless reading. I found Sweet Revenge on a bookshelf (probably an aquisition from the college days) and devoured it in two nights. The plot was a little outrageous and there wasn't much that could explain how the protagonist got her training to be a jewel thief extraordinaire, but it was INDEED entertaining. I liked all of the characters as a whole and found it to be a relaxing way to kill a few hours. By the way, I have noticed that I prefer the old Nora, such as Sweet Revenge and Montana Sky, to her newer stuff. Who knows..."
2,2 1/2 stars,"The first part of this book is the set up and background story of Adrianne and Philip. You learn about their childhoods and I felt it was really interesting and well-written. I kept thinking wow, I'm really going to feel for this couple because I feel like I ""know"" them. Well, when it finally got to the parts where the hero/heroine interact I wasn't feeling much at all. The chemistry wasn't there for me and I just thought it was kind of boring. I've read 5 Nora Roberts books so far and this is the one I like the least. I will keep on reading them though because I know what she is capable of."
3,Great to kids... not so much if you know better.,My niece loved it. I bought it for her for Christmas. I had some problems with it though because there is nothing to actually anchor it to the ground or even weight it down so it doesn't move. It's so lightweight though that it's not dangerous to let her play in it anyway.
1,Hideaway Blues,"My kids ages one and two got this for christmas. It was trashed the first day. The spring form construction would not stand up on it's own for very long. Just as soon as it was knocked over or the sides where touched it would fall over. There wasn't a bottom on it so it blew over easy. I would not waste your money or time it takes to fight with this hide out. The size was perfect, the idea was good, the colors where bright, but it just wouldn't stay up."
2,"Flimsy, but that shouldn't be a surprise",It's flimsy. It doesn't have any bottom support structure so it tends to flop over. My 2 year old daughter pretty much refuses to use it. It's already been relegated to the basement after sitting in the main play areas for less than a month.
1,AWFUL purchase ONly lasted two days..Horrible construction. My children arent even that rough. AWFUL most awful toy!!!,This was an awful worst purchase I have made. I do in home childcare and this tent didnt even last 2 days. It doesnt stand up well at all. For play hut I AM SHOCKED I have so mant other tents that are just pop ups they have lasted years and this one is so POORLY made I am shocked for PLAY HUT....
1,A bad psychologists opinion,"I thought it would be a biography of Catherine Cookson. Instead, it was a long, drawn out opinion of the author's psychoanalytic option of her. Boring. I would have preferred to form my own options of Catherine's character. isn't it unethical to reveal patient/doctor information?"
2,Kate's Daughter-my review,I really didn't like the way it was written. Very hard to follow.About the lamest autobiography I've ever read.
2,not that good,"I have a lot of Jerry Goldsmith soundtracks, and this is probably the one I like the least. There was not one track that appealed to me. Usually there is a track that stands out, like the beginning of STAR TREK THE MOVIE which is excellent. Not so with this banal soundtrack. They have a lot of gall to ask such a rediculous price for this soundtrack."
2,Out of tune,"I checked this level step by step by manufacture instruction and it was out of tune 200%. I suppose to bring it to the repair center,I've just sent it back. I recommend to check this product carefully before use."
3,new moon gazer,"This is a reasonably good (not great) telescope. The optics are very good. However, the stand is shaky. So, adjusting the scope is challenging."
5,PUNK FOREVER,"This CD rules. If I could only have one CD, this would be it. If you skateboard, BMX, or Mountainboard you'll love it. Really gets your adrenalin pumping."
4,Kravac creates another winner!,"This CD is definitely worth buying! Producer Steve Kravac has put the same creativity from his MxPx producing jobs into this project. While having a blast with the heavy punk sound, the listener can reflect on the group's focus on God and the Spiritual. The one problem with this album is that their sound isn't original enough. They sound too much like MxPx, but even that isn't all that bad! Definitely worth a listen, especially if you love punk music!"
5,Sweet mother of mercy!,"although it pales in comparison to the first two releases (especally the first, when he sings with the cool voice) Burn Out is still really tight and inovative new wave punk and everybody should buy at least two copies of this album so their grandparents can listen too."
2,dissapointing,"""rusty"" was one of the greates albums i've ever heard, and I was really looking forward to Burn out. but when I put it on, I was really dissapointed. All the songs sound the same, with riffs everyone have heard a thousand times before. the vocals are really cheesy, coming from a 16 year old. He sounds like a girl. everybody else seems to like this, but when you think about it, it's not very original. this band has too much of Strung Out in it. the only thing I found good about this album is the guitar solos by Jackson. They amaze me. too bad he quit the band. now I don't believe slick shoes's new album can be any better. bye it if you want, what do I care..."
3,Good music,"This was the last CD that featured Jackson on guitars and he sure left the band on a strong note. The music is amazing on this album. While some of the songs are a bit repetitive and Ryan's vocals are unusally annoying at times, I still enjoy ""Burn Out,"" by Tooth and Nail vets Slick Shoes. They showcase their musical gifts very well on this CD and some of the songs are incredible for a pop-punk band. Where the CD runs into some problems is their inabiltiy to produce three or four songs in a row that you don't have to skip over. It seems like I am always playing the same four or five songs over and over again. However, if you are convinced you are a Slick Shoes fan, the cost of ""Burn Out"" is worth it just for ""For Better, For Worse"", ""Fool Me No More,"" ""Fulfilling"", ""When Does it End,"" and the hidden track ""Simple."" Verdict-72/100"
1,V-Iceman Gone-th,"Wow, What's with all the good reviews? I don't care about the money but its the fact that the time I wasted listening to this crap is gone! I tried to give it a chance but I don't think going to see Dr. Dre would help. Flatline.............. Ice Ice Baby made him a One Hit Wonder and he even (...) that one up on this one. Ice, stick to real estate the music career is over."
1,What a sick b@st@rd!!,So far the only 1 song I like was Ice Ice Baby... ALL of the other songs sucks... yeah yeah Vanilla Ice deserves to die and bury him in the ground right next to Brittany Spears!!!
2,V man changing what he can,"Vanilla Ice is doing to rap music what the Beatles did to rock music, just kidding.At a party playing these tracks will most likely break everyone in to hysterics or you won't have many friends.Be warned,Novelty Alert!!"
1,OmGwtfPwnd,"OK, I just stopped by to see the reviews, I did not buy the album cuz Im not that lame...I did listen to previews, This album is weak..If you are a die hard fan, This album is still weak..One Hit wonder, no mic skills at all..If you like HipHop,,Real HipHop not any weak Sh**, pick up the new Guru album, Little Brother,Saigon,Murs,AZ,Alchemist...One"
3,Ok,"There is a few good songs and some really bad ones, pointless skits and heavy metal not favourites. Songs i liked are:1)Survivor2)Ninja Rap 23)Mecca & Ice4)O.K.S.5)Dunn Natt6)Tell me whyBig Vanilla ice fan looking forward to his new album ""word to your mother."""
1,Just not well written,"This book doesn't try very hard to hide its leftist agenda, but even if that's what you're looking for, this book is poorly written and an uninteresting read. I got the feeling that a family member or an ex-girlfriend commissioned it. This book sells itself as a persona-based history of that period in Nicaragua. It's weak on facts and gave me the feeling that Linder was too. Maybe it was poorly researched or maybe he really was just clowning around. Depressing on all fronts. Don't bother."
4,Sweet little film,I saw this film when it first came out and was delighted to see it available on DVD. It's a sweet film suitable for the whole family (although some might have a tricky time following the Scottish accents) with some very funny moments. There are one or two holes in the plot but overall it's a charming film. And you definitely don't want to miss that gorgeous Scottish countryside.
5,Best theoritical book there is in the field.,"This is actually a reprint of Mapping the Terrain of the Heart; The Six Capacities That Guide the Journey of Love"" (Item # 0201608650). Goldbart and Wallin are the authors of the original work, not editors of an anthology. This is the best description I've ever seen of the tasks to be worked on by couples in a committed relationship. Honeymoons will go sour for reasons embeded in the forming of the relationship. It is wise to know what's ahead, so you can plan for it. At least you will not be surprised by what unfolds. The basis for my opinion is extensive reading in the field and more personal experience than there is room for me to describe. The book is well written but terse; it is not an easy read."
5,Help for those struggling in relationships,"Mapping the Terrain is a wonderful resource for individuals who have difficulty staying in a relationship. It looks at the six capacities of loving; erotic involvement, merging, idealization, integration, refinding, and self-transcendence. This book will help you to identify the barriers to maintaining a relationship, why this happens, and what you can do about it. A great resource for individuals who fall in love but struggle to stay in love."
4,Well...,"This is, of course, typical BBB house. He hits Chicago style, does some booty and then the guessable disco grooves that he's known for. Bad Boy Bill fans will love the album.One reviewer stated that ""if you are looking for progressive house"" that you shouldn't look to Bill. Well no kidding. BBB doesn't PLAY progressive. However, neither do Sasha and Digweed. That's called progressive and melodic trance.Please learn your genres before you go slamming an artist."
1,Bad Boy Bill has sold out,"This is house music, decently mixed, but it lacks any soul whatsoever. The beats will move you in parts, but in the middle of the only good track (Pumpin') Bad Boy Bill ruins it by adding a sample announcing that he is a world class DJ, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG! He didn't write that song, all he did was place the vinyl on the turntable. In Bangin' the Box 4 BBB demonstrates he can mix, but seeing him live is a dissapointment, he is lousy outsite the studio. Any DJ from Chicago should be ashamed Bad Boy Bill claims he is from thier town. If you want to hear good SOULFUL Chicago House without the DJ trying to be a superstar, look up Mark Farina, Glenn Underground or if you are lucky enough to find him, Paul Johnson!!"
2,Big Hype Bill,"If you like booty dancing ghetto house, Bad Boy Bill will satisfy your dopamine and testosterone driven urges with this disgrace to house music. The tracks are all way too short, and I have to admit, they are mixed well, but the choice of music is not too appealing if you are used to deep house. Bill switches tracks before one can even get into the groove of the current song. If you want some good progressive house music I would recommend Sasha and John Digweed - Bad Boy Bill is way too cocky to be smooth."
3,"It is very informative, but...","As the title said, it is a dictionary. But because it is one of symbols i had assumed that it would not only tell about the symbols but also show what they look like. It talks about many types of symbolism and some history of certain symbols, but as i said, i wih they did more than describe it."
4,Odd proportions for a cat,"This kitty is soft, fuzzy, and very squeezable. The only problem I have is that the head seems too small for the body, or maybe the legs are too chunky. Something is proportionally off with this otherwise cute kitty."
1,Not much better than free online docs,This book isn't much better than freely available online documents on the same subjects. The book suffers from the usual problems of a book with so many authors--the material overlaps and doesn't present a single cohesive perspective.
1,Same boring Web Services Book,"I purchased few books this year on Web services and the frustrating thing about the latest ones is thatthey all seem to be talking about the same topics, this oneis no different. I was mislead by all these raving reviews!There are certain parts of this bookthat you could find in a standard J2EE book (lots available online for free), other sections such as JWS Pack apis are a waste of paper in my opinion (look at the tutorial, they did a good job!). This technology has changed so much over the last year and there are still books that cover JAX-RPC & JAXM enough already! Out of the whole book, there is only a handful of good chapters that I may benefit from, or ... maybe not."
5,Both fundamentals and advanced concepts,"I heard from a friend at Tata that several people bought this book and liked it. I also saw it mentioned in several groups. It is a practical book which starts with grounding fundamentals. Readers should walk away with a core understanding of web services and not just a particular tool set for working with them. The authors illustrate how they are used, and given practical and even handed reasons why their approach should be preferred."
5,"Study, don't just read this book","Many reviewers misunderstand the purpose of this book. In my opinion, this book is gold! The first three chapters give a clear and concise description of the technologies, without complication or over simplification.This book really worked for me. The compilation from experts with domain expertise created balanced and in-depth discussion without the ""hype"" associated with this subject. Key concepts and definitions, using examples and great illustrations, made this an easy book to read, but never shallow. If you want a great introduction to Web services, combining business strategy and technical architecture, this book is for you"
2,Widely publicised book,"I found this book to be widely publicised using discussion groups and emails. They also went to the extend that every recruiter purchased this book and asked questions in recuitment interviews based on this book! I think that was a novel, albeit cheap way of marketing a technical book.I bought this book about two weeks back and was trying to make sense out of it till now. This book does not live upto the standards that's expected of such famed authors. Maybe it's a bit too early to come out with an architecture book on java web services when even Sun Microsystems are in double mind about the success of Web Services as such. there are many silly mistakes in this book. Also some incomplete info. i dont recomment this book in its present edition."
2,Disappointed,"I am involved in a project to determine the best practices for integrating web services into our applications. We purchased a handful of recommended books on the topic including this one. I have to say that I am disappointed in this book.First off there is little coverage of web services from an architecture point of view. There are some decent chapters that introduce the concepts of web services and SOA and then the authors jump directly into reference mode on the dozen or so technologies that they think you must master to develop web services.Maybe it is just a failure of the J2EE process, but this book does little to address the confusion and complexity involved with developing web services in Java. In fact this book just adds to the problem. Developers should not need to know all the details of SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, and all the JAX APIs in order to develop web services. For the most part, all this plumbing technology should be hidden from developers yet it is the focus of this book."
5,Complete coverage of web services,This is one of the most complete books on web services published to date. The authors have done a great job of writing about both architectural and development issues surrounding web services.
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,I judge a book by how hard it is for me to put it down and when I started to read this book I simply could not put it down! Good character development and INTENSE STORY! This book was worth every penny. 5 stars from me.
1,One star is five too many,"Absolute junk. Boxes are not cut and creased properly. About 66% are defective, and can't be used. Take your money, set it on fire, and you'll at least get to be entertained while it burns."
1,A waste of money,These are not worth your money. They are difficult to put together and the corners do not fold into place properly. I threw them away. DO NOT PURCHASE!
2,Inadequate latch,"I was very disappointed when I received this file box and the latch didn't snap closed. When I picked it up, the box just flung open, and that was with nothing in it. I was expecting better from a Rubbermaid product."
2,Deadly dull,"DEADLY PASSION is a made-in South Africa crime drama that stars Brent Huff, an obscure American actor and Ingrid Boulting, an equally unknown to US audiences Suid Afrikaner. Third billed (as Brent's half-brother) is James Coburn's son Harrison. His film resume consists of only TWO 1985 efforts: this, and a decent West German war flick called MORENGA. The latter was whittled to two hours from a 3-part mini-series.SYNOPSIS--An L.A. private eye (Huff) takes a case in the Bahamas that leaves him recovering from a gunshot wound in a Bahamian hospital. While there he meets a lady (Boulting) from his home turf who asks for help in wresting her dead husband's assets from the control of a crooked business manager (Robert Chandler). She plays on the detective's affections in their mutual illegal scheme and sets him up for a double-cross.This movie is not now nor will it ever be available on DVD. Count on that...."
1,Deception,"I purposedly decided to write a review as one star to countermand the nonsense of others who have given this book one star.It is OBVIOUS that the people who wrote one star reviews are far-right wing ""thinkers."" What a bunch of nonsenseto hurl the unfounded and ridiculous claims that this is a biased source. It is a collection of primary documents!!!But that is the age we live in now. We are supposed to be proud of defeating communism which is popularly demonized as Stalinism,and yet while we point at Stalinism as an era in which people were erased from photographs, the press was controlled, knowledge waselided and removed, and propaganda was social realist, we find ourselves in a society in which there is strong current among the Tea Partyto remove knowledge, and do the very same things that Stalin did. Shameful. This book is an excellent historical source, it does notpander to historical fundamentalism."
5,"The best book on the Vietnam War, bar none!!",A fantastic read and the best single history of the war yet written!
4,Another Perspective on Our Mistakes...,"Should we have dropped the bomb and saved 58000 lives? Or should we have pulled out in the early sixties? Whatever the answer is, we can find some clues with Appy's title. Appy gives us some views from all sides of the past and current issues. And, as I always argue-we should read all that we can about this conflict. 58,000 of our fellow citizens died for us. Some of those who didn't came home to criticize their fellow soldiers and national politicians. Some remained behind in dingy makeshift prisons. Only when this is done can we determine who our heroes were. John McCain as a prisoner or John Kerry who came home to testify before Congress of his tales of mass murder and other atrocities."
3,"Good eSATA card, but beware of BOIS updates","This card is a good eSATA card from SIIG. Like countless cards out there it relies on a Silicon Image 3132 chip and a BOIS to control it. Basic card and it is IDENTICAL to all other SIIG PCI Express eSATA cards... except for the BOIS. The pseudo (aka firmware) RAID function is fully in the BOIS and that is the only thing different between the models. So, NEVER update the BOIS with a 3132 BOIS update unless you want to loose the RAID function. Basically, I think this product is a rip off.. they charge a lot more money for a different firmware on the BOIS but the EXACT same boards/chipset as other much cheaper products."
3,Bentley- Review,"The Bentley does NOT give step-by-step troubleshooting advice. It *assumes* you know what ""it"" is, where ""it"" is & how. Hard to follow (this said from someone who did mechanical design for a living). NO INDEX. Generally vague Table of Contents. But, since there is no alternative repair maual available, it is the only game in town, and thus a ""must have."" Be prepared to be frustrated! Good luck!"
2,Don't Rely on this book,"This repair manual tells you just enough to get you into trouble.The Air conditioning section is incomplete, and offers nothing for prior to 86 models!The ignition switch area is incomplete, and leaves you hanging.Many sections leave a lot to the readers imagination.Not very complete, and not a good value."
1,Frustration Printed into Book Format,"I have a Vanagon, I have this book. Sadly, the book doesn't ever help me fix it. This book is an endless source of frustration for me. It's impossible to find what you need, the pictures are clear images, but unhelpful. If you aren't a shop mechanic skilled with Volkswagens and you are trying to do it yourself, pay a mechanic, expensive as it may be, and save yourself the frustration and cost of this book. I could use some very bad words to describe this book, but I'll refrain."
1,No os lo compreis,"No vale la pena. es demasiado técnico y no explica las cosas como se debiera. Si no eres mecánico ólvidate de él.Por cierto. El modelo TD que es el mio, no lo cubre.Por la pasta que vale, ya se podían haver esmerado más"
4,product review,"This item is an excellent source especially when you don't have a manual for the vehicle. It is meant for a mechanic and has lots of diagrams. For non-mechanic with some car experience, it can help when you go to your mechanic."
5,VW classic,"I found this manual after my sister asked me to order it for her from the manufacturer. Well, I decided to browse around a little and found that, yet again, Amazon delivered the goods so to speak. Needless to say, it was considerably cheaper. The end result - brother-in-law said it is perfect for his needs as he usually does a lot of the work on their VW van himself, but occasionally gets stumped. This manual fills in a lot of the gaps. Those are his comments as I know zip about anything mechanical."
5,the best manual for this van,"I saw different manuals on Vanagon, and I aslo have some knowlege in Vanagon repairs - so this book is the best manual for this VW, it's all what you need to repair your van, so you do not need to review any web-forums any more!"
4,got it running,used this to fix and repair my 1985 wasserboxer.factory manuals are the best!it is still running and going strong.
4,It's a fairly decent book,"Though this book has some bad reviews they are most likley the result of incompentent do-it-your self people. If you have at least a general understanding of engine componants, and a reasonable intellect this book is excellent for you. Some steps can be confusing from time to time, but for the most part are worded well and have very good pictures to accompany the steps.*Note* Besides what else are you going to buy, Haynes and Chilton's don't make a book for the Vanagon."
3,Fun on a budget,"This is a pretty decent entry-level compressor. If you're just getting into airbrushing or you know you're only ever going to work on small projects, this is an excellent purchase. However, if you're potentially at risk of working on anything larger than a model kit or a t-shirt you'll probably want to bite the bullet and get something with a larger capacity now rather than later. I've recently started customizing bike frames and on the long strokes this compressor's capacity can feel frustratingly anemic.So to sum up:Small projects = goodLarge projects = bad"
4,hard to rate.,"A Carbon Monoxide Alarm is hard to rate because it just sits there until you need it, hopefully never. It plugs in and the little on light says it is working. It does lay flat to the world and doesn't take up much room."
1,aficionado,not a good movie.not your fault. i thought i was getting something and it turned out to be something else.
5,An eye-opening book,"I've ordered several books to better understand my daughter's OCD but since she is not the traditional ""hand-washer"" the books didn't help. This book does. It explores so many facets of OCD that I didn't see (nor did her psychologist) before. It has helped me look at my daughter's behaviors in a new way and see the disease manifest itself in ways I never thought of before. I would highly recommend this easy-to-read book to anyone who has a child with OCD and/or anxiety problems. It was exactly what I needed."
3,D is for Doufu: An Alphabet Book of Chinese Culture,This book came to me quickly. Has beautiful paintings and interesting things about the culture. Worth my purchasing. Thanks!
3,"Good idea, poor execution","This is a great looking mirror, and seems sturdy enough when you take it out of the package, set it up, and use it. The mirror flips upside down to a magnification side, which is also lighted around the edge. The only disappointment is that two of the light settings (Evening and Office) are too dim to be of any use. Seems the Office setting was meant to mimic flourescent lighting, but this just doesn't cut it. If you want that effect with this mirror, you'll have to set up a flourescent light next to it. I'd really like it if *all* the settings were brighter. I'm settling for this mirror only because after researching them, I haven't found any other affordable lighted mirrors that are any better than this one."
3,My wife likes the mirror - getting bulbs a pain!,My wife likes this mirror but the bulbs burned out. They are not easy to get. Couldn't find them on the Conair website. Bed Bath & Beyond sells them but only at their larger stores. The 2 closest BB&B stores don't carry them. I have to drive 40 minutes round trip plus pay $10 for 2 bulbs. What a pain/rip!
2,TO LITTLE LIGHT,THE MIRROR IS NICE TO LOOK AT BUT DOESN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH LIGHTING. VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT ON MAKE UP.
1,very poor lighting,"This makeup mirror has the poorest lighting of any I have ever used. All of the settings were poorly lit, with the daylight one being the brightest. I can't believe how many positive reviews this product has gotten. I am giving it one star because I get better light looking in my wall mounted bathroom mirror. I will be sending this back immediately. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!"
2,Kind of cheap,"For the price this mirror is pretty cheap. Seems like it is made of cheap plastic, really should of been sturdier. Other then that it serves the purpose. Really tho, should be priced between 15 and $20."
4,Conair Mirror,Product is fine and meets my expectations. Good product for the dollar investment. Would suggest someone else to purchase this item in the future.
3,It's Okay,"The mirror is fine, the lighting not so much. I mostly use it in the morning when there is not enough natural light for me to put on my makeup. But the color of the light on each setting is yellow, and I have to turn it to the very last setting to get the most light the settings before the last are dim."
5,unbelievable,"this mirror was far less expensive than i could find ""in town"". It looks exactly like it does in the picture and arrived very quickly."
5,One of the best 'new' TD albums,"This is an excellent album, and I think represents TD's transition from the music of the 70's and 80's to the Tangerine Dream of the 90's. The album is truly a roller-coaster experience, with many emotions being stirred. Together with Oasis, this is one of my favorite TD album from the 90's. If you're new to Tangerine Dream, buy this CD."
3,Smooth Guitar makes it worthwhile!!,"Joe ""J.J."" Sansaverino has been playing guitar since he was 13. He originally started playing violin and trumpet at the age of 11. A Berklee College of Music graduate, he's worked with some of the greats in popular music. For his debut CD, he takes a turn at smooth jazz and hip R&B. J.J.'s guitar playing style will remind you of Lee Ritenour. His selection of tracks is smooth, easy and mellow, all original compositions. The highlight is the track ""Sunshine"" as I enjoyed the mix of vocals and his great guitar playing. Though his production is top notch, I can't help but thinking that he didn't give it his all in a few of the tracks. Half way through the recording, the CD loses a bit of punch in it step. The track, ""My Lover"" seems bland and out of place to go along with the rest of the recording. Despite the shortcomings, the CD is still a good listen. He's a future star in the world of smooth jazz music."
3,Skeptical,"This isn't your typical regular formatted DVD. No scene selection. Rather it goes by 10 minute intervals.I also remember a different ending to the movie where the terrorists are seen ""hanging"" in the back rows of the plane. It is not included in this DVD."
5,My daughter loved this even at 7 months!,"I bought this book when my daughter was 7 months old and she loved it from the start. She is now almost 10 months. The pictures are BIG, and one baby to a page, so it's easy for her to pay attention. And I really think she has a crush on one of them (the cement mixer!). She always laughs when she sees him. I took it with me to the photographer and it's the only thing that got her to smile for them camera. Young babies are drawn to other babies and faces and this book is perfect for them!"
4,We love it at our house...,"We first received this as a ""hand-me-down"" book from a friend. Then...disaster struck when we lost it while visiting my step-mom this summer! Luckily, Amazon carries it! My little boy has loved this book ever since he was about 5 months old. Yes, the photos do seem slightly out of focus. Why? Who knows! However, the babies' expression are exceptionally genuine and he loves to look at them over and over. It is much more engaging then some of the board books we have with illustrations of babies. For whatever reason, my little boy gravitates towards this book quite often when he is getting tired, so it's a great bedtime read."
1,A waste of money,"I was really disappointed with this book. The pictures, especially the last one, seem out of focus, the rhyme is rather silly, and the pictures aren't very engaging. If you are looking for a book with baby pictures in it I would suggest Happy Baby Colors by Priddy or What Color? by Anthea Sieveking."
3,wrong color marble,"The package the table came in was very secure so nothing was broken when I received it, but it was extremely difficult to open. The table base was very easy to put together, however the wrench that was supposed to come with it was not included in one of them, so I'm thankful I ordered two tables because the wrench was included in the other one. When I opened the package containing the marble top and glass, imagine my surprise when the ""ivory"" marble was actually a mustard color yellow instead. It half way went with my living room set and there was no way that I could attempt to put it back in the most difficult packaging I've ever encountered, so I kept them, but the ivory marble top trim that was advertised would have been better. There were no predrilled holes to attach the marble top to the base so I did have to use a power screw driver, which made it a lot easier. The tables are very nice otherwise."
5,gorgeous nudes,This is one of the best art books I have seen for ages. I love the idea behind the book and I wish I could have been involved in this project- that's how good the photos are!
2,"An old idea, poorly executed.","There is nothing original in the concept behind this book--photographing supposedly ordinary people in the nude has been done many times before by better photographers. Contrary to the the complaint of another reviewer that some of the models are too ordinary, ordinariness is the point. If there is anything to complain about the models it is that too many of them are young, slim, white women. No, the problem here is that the models are poorly posed in silly locations--this photographer seems to think that best thing to do with ordinary people is to pose them as Helmut Newton would. I know the work of Helmut Newton and Rankin is no Helmut Newton. This book is an insult to the models who posed for it--they deserve better. (By the way, when will photographers, designers, and publishers ever learn that printing an image over two pages with a cavernous gutter in the middle destroys the image--it's a waste of paper.)"
3,A TAD FLIMSLY BUT USEABLE,"I had to do some considerable lateral reinforcing of the rails when using a heavy plunge router. Otherwise a serviceable product. Buy extra letter sets for Milescraft 2202 1-1/2-Inch Router Signmaking Template Letter Set. ROFLMAO. Seriously, a good product when used with great tenderness.."
1,A book full of personal experience,"This book provides information based on the author's personal information, which would be different from owner to owner. The author spent almost half of the book talking about ""why keeping chickens"" and the law about chicken raising in the city. It may probably be useful for you if you want someone to convince you in buing a chicken, but to me, it completely useless.It doesn't provide me with any technical information about chickens, not even their life span and some health issue. Instead, the author spent a few pages to talk about her personal experience in keeping chickens and how HER chickens act. It rather like ""My diary of keeping chickens! Tending Small Flocks in my place"".I eventually bought another book, in which I obtained useful information what I expected, ""Keeping pet chickens"" by (J. Paul & W. Windham, 2005). If you are after a useful piece of advice on keeping chicken pets, I would recommend this book."
5,Keep Chickens! -- The Title Says It All!,"This book is a must for the Urban poultry enthusiast -- whether just starting with chickens or for someone with a few hens already, this is an invaluable resource. I am a rural farmer with a flock of hens & roosters (and guinea fowl as well) and I still picked up a few tid-bits and ideas, and it was wonderful to read about the author's chickens. Her enthusiasm for her girls is contagious, and I'm glad to know I'm not the only one with pampered poultry!"
4,Good suburb chicken book,"This book is insightful, has lots of quality information, and is less than 150 pages of text. If you are a city/suburb backyard chicken hobbyist this book is the right book for you. ""Storey's Guide To Raising Chickens"" by Gail Damerow has much more information, and is a better resource if you plan on having more than three or four hens (The author even tells talks about Damerow's book in her book). But Kilarski's book is true to it's title, ""Keep Chickens! Tending Small Flocks in Cities, Suburbs, and Other Small Spaces."" The author does tend to ramble from time to time but it's not over the top. Again, the title of the book is right on the money for what this book does."
5,The Big Bounce,"This film was a made years ago which has a realy good story line But has a great sound track. I would recomend it to anyone who likes a good story in California life style with mystery an outstanding cast with suspense,and music"
3,DISC QUALITY EXCELLENT . . . .,"and looks like the technicolor print I saw in the army which stands up beautifully. Ryan O'Neil can not deliver a line, but Leigh Taylor Young can and in spades. She is a knock out and for me the fun of the film. The supporting cast is also a good one. It is a shame who ever decided to cut up Elmore Leonard's book wasn't fired before the film was made. They left out a main character which created lot of the tension and blackmail. Elmore Leonard's Kill Shot was short changed the same way; too bad! The books are good. I give this 3 stars for Leigh Taylor Young;and it is far from the worst film you will see."
3,The original Big Bounce on DVD,"When it was first released, The Big Bounce was crucified by the critics and its reputation has never recovered. It's not a great movie by any means but it is interesting and entertaining. The central characters are not particularly likable and the general attitude of the movie is pretty cynical.The DVD has quite good picture quality and the images are firm and stable. This DVD looks good even when watched via a projector on a large screen."
1,Finejewlers.com needs to match its name!,I received the earrings in the following condition:1. Dirty. Tiny black goo dots on the gemstones mixed with hair! I was saved a big embarrassment by examining the gift before giving it to my fiancé in front of her family.2. No certificate of Authenticity of the gold Studs or the Sapphire (as was advertized to accompany the item).3. No Lifetime Warranty Certificate (as was advertized to accompany the item)4. No Gift Message (as I had requested during ordering)Perception is reality. And right now I can't even be sure of how genuine the product is by the sloppy and careless way the order was handled.
1,Looks black - poor craftsmanship,"These earrings do not look blue at all - the sapphires are so dark, they look back and little light gets through the stone, even if you shine a flashlight on them. The posts are very thin and bend way too easily. Returned these and looked for a better quality item."
1,Can't tell the difference between these and onyx...,"They shipped quickly and are very large stones but they are so dark they literally look like onyx. For $200, I'm disappointed. I bought them because the only other studs my wife has are diamonds. My wife likes these, they are a great size, but I know I would be happier if they actually looked BLUE! I probably will not buy sapphires online again. The pictures people have posted of these look nothing like the stones we received. I guess there is just too much variability in sapphires to buy sight-unseen."
2,Opaque!!!,"They look nothing like the picture. These stones are very cloudy and dark. They appear midnight blue only in direct sunlight, but do not sparkle. One of the stones even looks milky at the bottom."
3,ok ppv,please dont give things 5 stars if u haven't seen it this ppv is ok but there are much better ones and its not a 5 star ppv not even close to to it
2,"TNA Great, this PPV not.",TNA is great but this is their worst pay per view. Even the Ultimate X match isn't that good. Save your money and get one of TNA's best PPV's Final Resolution which includes TNA's best Ultimate X match.
2,Worst $70 I have ever spent!,"One word can describe this item and that is CHEAP! Cheap materials, cheaply made, but expensive for what you get! It is basically a trophy with laminaded wood and the glue was everywhere! If you put your taps on and want to change them around/out the screws come out...every one of them! I could have built one made with better materials for much cheaper. Stay away!"
3,Impossible to fold up,"We just received this tent yesterday, and while my girls love it, I have been wrestling with it all night to get it back in the bag. It boasts about how easy it is to fold, but there is nothing easy about it. The directions are just not cutting it. It should come with a video on how to do it. I have given up for now, and am leaving it up in the living room, and now have noticed the shape is somewhat distorted already. Very, very frustrating."
5,Full of Emotion,This is one of my favorite Jonn Serrie albums. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is written with tremendous emotion and a seeming longing for something unfulfilled. Only Jonn can make this kind of feeling come through a keyboard.
1,"This is not music, people","If you are looking for music, I advise listening to someone else. If you like listening to calculated noise, then this is more in line for you. Sorry, but this album and others by Mr. Serrie are just ""stuff""."
1,Underdeveloped Main Character Numerous Mispellings and Punctuations,"This book is disappointing. The writer is a gifted storyteller but the typos, run on sentences, and punctuation errors were a huge turn off. The summary is misleading in that one of the main characters, the slave Reinert, is severely underdeveloped. Is this on purpose? Also, the supposed friendship between Reinert and Bart is a joke. With friends like Bart, who needs enemies. Do not read this book if you are looking for a well balanced account of both races during the civil war era. This book leans heavily on the racist sentiments running rampant during that period of American history."
4,incorrect use of words,"I have enjoyed the story, the characters and the historical information but I do not understand how or if this book was edited. At various points in the book a letter written in the time period (War between the States)and by uneducated characters is presented with the slang and word errors typically found in these letters; i.e. there for their. But this error is continued throughout the remainder of the text."
4,Very Interesting Storyline...,"I am halfway through the book and while I love the story line, I find the punctuation and spelling errors and the running together of sentences very irritating. I must often go back and re-read a page in order to understand it. This being said, I am enjoying the story very much. I wish someone had proofread before publishing. It would have made reading this book so much easier."
2,The Red Cotton Fields,"The Red Cotton Fields is a compelling story; however, the writing is exceptionally poor. It uses the same phrases over and over and frequently includes descriptions to the point of tedium; misuses and misspells many, many words; and the grammar is atrocious. Despite this, I could hardly put the book down until I got to the end of the story. I was disappointed in the end. It was really lukewarm after all the dynamic events preceding it. If the reader can look beyond the writing style, the book is worth reading."
2,shameful editing!!!,"""The Red Cotton Fields"" could have been a wonderful saga of a southern family during the Civil War. Author Michael Srickland should fire his editor Sandy Fowler for delivering such a shamefully edited book. The typist is either illiterate, uses English as a second language, or is hearing impaired and had the book narrated to her for typing. It took forever to read due to sentence structure, incorrect or nonexistent punctuation. The story is 4 star, but has to be down-rated due to poor quality of editing."
1,Red Cotton Fields,"Save yourself some time and money. Poor boy makes good along with his childhood friend,a slave. Slave ends up getting killed by the ""evil twin"". The North wins the war. Everybody ends up happily married to the one they should have married first.This book started out OK and I was looking forward to reading it. But, like you have probably read in other reviews the punctuation was awful,not to mention run on sentences.The author also does not know the difference between ""there"" and ""their"". That's just one example out of MANY. Lots of foul (or is it fowl?)language. The southern belles equally able to match the language of the men.What would their mama think? Also lots of Jesus Christ and God used, but not in a good way.So many repetitive descriptions and character thoughts, I started just skipping to dialogue just to get finished with the book.Whoever edited this book needs to look for another line of work."
2,red cotton fields,Very tedious. Not proof written very well. Book was very long and repetitive.Basic theme was good but so much of the lack of being proofread got in the way of it being enjoyable.
1,save your money...,"not worth the price ... nor the time it would take to read. Editing and grammatical errors aside, the story is weak and boring."
2,Too Many Errors,"I started reading this book on my Kindle, but I didn't finish it. There were errors in punctuation, errors in spelling, run-on sentencences, lack of proper paragragraphs, etc. For example, he substitutes ""due"" for do, ""taught"" for taut, ""wondering"" for wandering, and on it goes. I gave up after about 6 chapters, even though the story was good and characters were impellling. This author needs an editor in the worst way. I would have liked to have known how it turned out, but could not deal with the frustration I felt while trying to read it.Juanita Nobles, author of ""A Heritage of Faith"""
3,Could be a great novel with a little copy editing,"This is exactly the multigenerational,sweeping saga I've been searching for. However, the numerous typos, improper usage of plural versus possesive, homonyms (there versus their, throughout, was very distracting and frustrating. The book needs to be re-edited using more than spell check. I would definitely read it again once corrections are made and would heartily recommend it."
3,Interesting but too many mistakes,"Overall, the story line is engaging and exciting. I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next. Unfortunately, this book has an excessive amount of grammatical errors. I found myself getting quite perturbed with the wrong usage of homonyms. I guess if you can get past that, (as I obviously did), then you will probably enjoy the book."
3,Too many errors!!!,"I am still in the midst of reading this book, but as a retired teacher, I am not sure I can finish it! The story itself is engaging, although the author often repeats previous happenings in the book, as one might see on a continuing weekly tv series! What is really frustrating are the constant misspellings (baron for barren, wonder for wander, there for their), inappropriate use of some words (he constantly uses ""nor"" without its companion ""neither,) the run-on sentences and incorrect use of punctuation marks. One sentence even states something like ""I and she""! There are quite often question marks at the end of statements. I am finding myself skimming through the story just to avoid these horrendous errors. I really wish someone would edit this, so it can reach its potential."
4,Great book......really bad punctuation and grammar,"As others have said, the grammar and punctuation is really disappointing and that's a shame as the story is A1!"
3,Red Cotton Fields Long and Windy,Detailed description of aspects of Civil War were well done. The main characters in the story were not developed fully and the writing was somewhat amateurish and predictable.
3,Seeing the south with different eyes,I wasn't sure if I liked this book while reading it or not. The racism never stopped and the women cried incessantly. However this may be a more accurate look at the south during this time than other books I've read.
1,To Much,The book just jumped right into adult relations and that was more than I wanted. If you are interested in the Civil War era I would look for another source.
4,Wonderful pictures,"This book has great pictures of various objects (red ones, of course.) It is great for learning new words and objects, or encouraging a child to sort and organize things by color. The ""My Little Color Library"" books are especially fascinating to toddlers, who want to know the names of everything in each book. They are also the exact right size to fit in a play purse or basket (or hide in a drawer, or drop behind a bookcase....) so toddlers will love them."
2,Not Too Traditional,"I was expecting this book to have more traditional recipies such as mofongo, arroz con gandules & pasteles. Instead the recipies featured were more of the hotel touristy-type food that I know an average puertorican would not prepare in their home. I purchased this book in Old San Juan & the salesperson recommended another book, I should have taken her advice. I have since purchased the other book and that has exactly what I was looking for. Besides I heard a rumor the author was a vegetarian, how can you write a cookbook containig meat recipies and not eat them?"
2,not what i expected,it just wasnt anything like i expected and took forever to get. not satisfied at all i cannot use recipes for the family i am envolved with from puerto rico
3,please explain,"Why is this cookbook so expensive? I have tried to research the author and the price, but I can't figure out why someone would pay so much for one cookbook. Am I missing something?"
1,I was ONCE a big fan of Zonealarm....,"...but the latest versions seem to have gone the same way as Symantec's buggy bloatware. After years as a loyal paying customer, I have uninstalled ZA from all my computers. Agnitum's Outpost Firewall is what I'm using now - and it's been problem-free.The last few versions of ZA have given me nothing but trouble. I couldn't see flash animations on my preferred homepage. I couldn't complete certain transactions online without turning ZA off, completely defeating its purpose. I couldn't read some websites at all, and others loaded slowly, excruciating slowly, even though I have cable and most pages load with lightning speed."
1,Nope nope nope,"Product activation code is supposed to arrive within two-three business days by email. This took three weeks. And you MUST have it to run the software. After finally getting the code, we had many problems with the software BUT could not return it because by that time, the return period expired. If you have a home network, this is not a good choice."
1,Not the right product.,"I got this bear for my niece. It was not even the bear that is pictured, nor is it made by Gund. Complete ripoff!"
5,Best Baby Gift,"This is a great gift for a baby. It was my daughter's favorite. In fact, she's now 25 and still has one. We had to keep replacing them through the years because they were so loved. Makes a great baby gift."
5,Girlfriend Loves it More than Me!,"Title says it all. I bought it for her because she wanted it (she's living far away, and wanted something to remind her of me/home), and it's become her surrogate me. Soft, durable, and infinitely, nauseatingly cute, it's everything you'd want in a teddy bear."
5,Awesome & Moving,"I really can't tell you what Jeff's music does to move your soul and spirit. He has been to our church several times and each time, he is just great. He writes most of his own music. This CD is great!!!... I highly reccommend any of his music."
5,Demystifying Financing,"Wow! I have been in the business over 30 years and never have I seen such a concise, comprehensive explanation of creative financing. Those of us in the business may have heard of many of these techniques but to have them put before you in this manner is really usefull. Those not in the business or wanting to know how to finance without bank help this is a must read."
2,Not Put Together Well,"I was very inspired by the title of the book but was dismayed with the content. Having purchased properties through traditional financing techniques, I was looking for other methods of financing to increase my financial leverage.While I found many of the techniques discussed in the book very inspiring and got me thinking, the author was a sure let down in describing the details of his techniques on structuring the financing. The examples are somewhat abstract.This is not a good book for the beginner and probably a bit difficult for the experienced. His techniques are not fully explained and are based on many assumptions of the reader's knowledge."
5,How To Finance Any Real Estate Any Place Any Time,"If you are looking for creative ways to finance Real Estate, this book is a must have. Jim has been practicing what he preaches and explains various techniques that are easily understood.Having a book with various ideas that you can scan when a Real Estate financing comes up is a very valuable tool. His book is very easy to understand and read.A great to refer to now and in the future."
5,Nice.,"These are nice stories about two friends, Frog and Toad, read by the author. Very nice reading manner. Not all stories made sense to me in terms of content, but, after all, the targeted audience is the kids and they love this CD."
4,Please know there isn't a book,"There isn't a book with this set, but my daughter loves to listen to these stories before she falls asleep. I love that she's relaxing in bed instead of doing other stuff while she should be trying to go to sleep. I always loved the frog and toad stories as a kid, and I love passing these stories down to my kids."
5,Fabulous,I bought this for a road trip for my two and a half year old and she loves it. She requests it now almost every time we get in the car and when I brought the books home from the library today her face lit up with recognition. Arnold Lobel is a wonderful dramatic reader and the background music and sounds are absolutely perfect and so charming. Couldn't be better.
4,Helped on road trip,"Took this CD along on over 2200 mile road trip with my daughter and her 4 and 6 year old girls. They requested it many times, and we actually had some quiet miles while they listened to it. We were glad for any quiet miles we could get!!"
4,Kids love it,Play it at bedtime. There are six teen more words required before I can hit submit. Now there are four. Done
4,one of my childhood favorites,I had this stories when I was a kid. My mom used to read them to me and my siblings. Now I bought it for my 2 year old niece and hope it gives her many happy memories has it gave to me.
1,Slow,"These stories are slow paced and quite elementary, even for a three year old. There are much better audio books out there."
5,Pink Guitar wins the Grammy for Best Instrumental Pop Album!,"Just came back from the Grammy's...Pink Guitar won the Grammy in a category with a bunch of very talented artists.other nominees:Boney James - PureDave Koz - Saxophonicvarious artists - Forever, For Always, For LutherMason Williams - EP 2003: Music For The Epicurean HarkenerCongratulations to Producer James Jensen and all the contributing artists!!!:Aaron StangAl PettewayAmrit SondDavid CullenDoug SmithDoug Smith & Mark HansonEd GerhardLaurence JuberMark HansonMike DowlingPat DonohueWayne JohnsonWilliam CoulterThis CD also has a companion Guitar Book available which includes a lesson CD (with contributions from all the artists)"
4,works,My husband says that this is a good product and enjoys it and would recommend to others for their pads.
4,Great Set Plays,"Video has numerous set plays for different situations (kick in defensive, kick in offensive, corner). The plays are described graphically, then demonstrated by a young team. Good video for a futsal coach looking for some set play ideas."
3,Just Draw!!!!,"I have the unique position of taking the High Focus drawing class for 6 years graduate and undergraduate. At one time I was asked if I'd be open to teaching the class in the MFA masters program at SVA.Part of the problem with art instruction is that folks become so entrenched and close minded in regards to drawing and the methodologies behind various classes and teaching approaches.I say as an artist you owe it to yourself to explore various methods. The bottom line for me was to capture the essence or character of the subject and think about that the hell it is you're drawing. Most importantly when you're drawing think about making a great drawing, not a bad one. If every decision you make comes from this simple mindset then you can't fail. You drawings will consistently improve, incrementally at first then in big breaktrhoughs.I stated out God awful to leave with instructor comments like ""That's a drawing with B*lls"" I'll take that as a compliment."
4,education product,It is a very good book for students and other tht wnat to know the history of Africa. I have used it in my course at th Stockhom University.
5,Favorite textbook ever read so far,"This textbook covers Ancient African Civilizations and in interesting ways like did you know there were white Ancient Africans? LITERALLY WHITE PEOPLE originally there? did you know that there were Africans of all shades originally there most people don't know that and this book covers all dialects, religions, regions, how they went from clans/tribal formations to city state types and more. It is really an interesting read...I do not say ""oh wow there were white people there to make it seem like oh Africa should matter now"" but it takes away from everything I was taught for 29 years of school- white people are white because they left africa and the meletonin in their skin left so to find that this was not always true was so amazing and it gave me as a white woman and a Muslim a direct connection to the mother land."
2,Book feels padded out,This is not a good book. Written from a very American perspective the author devotes much of his writing trying to convince the reader that civilizations and socio-economic development can be something other than what we see in modern America today - something I'm sure any reader with the exception of someone expecting a coffee table book will already know.Most of the currently understood history is included but is presented from a very second-hand perspective. Analysis of data and development of argument is shallow.
5,Great big band selections,This was one of the most influential albums in my musical career. I bought it as a young teenager and played the grooves away. I still listen to it today and the reditions stand the test of time. Most definately worth the money !
5,Away we really go!,"This is the Buddy Rich band at his peak. Excellent numbers from his 1967 ""Away we go"" TV series period with co-star Buddy Greco.Great side-man like Jay Corre and Ernie Watts. I met Jay Corre in Amsterdam , he still blow off the roof!My first choice for any Buddy Rich album!"
1,One of the worst mice from Logitech,"This has to be the worst mouse I have ever used that is manufactured by Logitech.The optical sensor simply doesn't work right on any surface except on a good mouse pad. I tried to use it on my laminated wooden desk, it doesn't work. I tried to use to on my IKEA breakfast-in-bed plastic tray, it doesn't work. Only when I put it on top of a regular mouse pad then it will start to function like a mouse. My 10 years old first generation Logitech optical mouse is more precise than this mouse. Even my traditional ""ball"" mouse is better.There is also serious motion lag issue as well. You do not want to use this mouse on gaming or image editing applications. It will drive you nuts. I guess there is some problem with the wireless transmitter.Stay away from this mouse!!!"
5,Great Book,"This is book is the real deal, I thought Lazer Broidie was inspiring...this the real deal..Give it a read!!! It can be rather wordy,still it is very eductional and informative!"
4,Arco Everything You Need to Score High On the ASVAB (16th Ed,"I found this book to be a great help in taking the ASVAB test. There are four sample tests in this book and I took all of them. They do not ask the same questions in each test, and I found my practice grades getting higher with each test. I was especially worried about my math score, because I hadn't taken a math course in a few years. I found it covered everything I remember, and a few things I'd never seen before. It also showed me how to do the problems and explained them thouroughly. The only problem I had with the book is it stated to give in-depth profiles on 130 military careers, and there civilian counterparts to not go into very much detail. The descriptions were, at most, half a page long, and very general in description. I thought the job descriptions would be more involved. I've already taken the ASVAB test and my scores were higher because of this book. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to higher there scores."
4,great choice,"I bought this book to help my son prepare for the ASVAB. There are not only multiple tests for each subject area, but practice exams that can pinpoint what your focus in a certain area needs to be. An example of this is in the word knowledge section, it explains about looking for similar words, looking at paragraph content, and looking at the root words to help find the correct answer. The answers for each section and practice section are provided and explanations accompany them. This is a very thorough exam prep book."
4,COUNTERPOINT WORKBOOK,I'VE NEVER SEEN WORKBOOK OF COUNTERPOINT AND I THINK IT'S VERY USEFULL AND CAN HELP WHO STUDYING COMPOSITIONS.IF YOU INTEREST HOW CAN YOU WRITE COUNTERPOINT YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!
2,Its alright,"I ordered this gun because it was such a great deal. When it arrived, i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked (a big crack), nothing a little gorrila glue can't fix though. Also the accuracy isn't consistent, it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20-30 feet. I had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate, otherwise it was 3 feet high. The pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too. So this gun was a good deal but isn't the best quality gun i've had. You have to load it from the top of the gun, which means taking off the laser, putting in the bbs, and putting on the laser again. The magazine doesn't even come off! It still has decent speed, and isn't crap (it's just bad). It was worth 15 bucks though."
4,cool air-soft gun for my son,"My 12y/o son has a collection of a air-soft guns. He liked the quality of the IRS shotgun and offered no complaints. If he is happy,so am I."
1,One boys review,"When I got this gun some of the bullets in the gun did not shoot out and most of them just fell out of the front. Also the clip doesn't come out. If you are really into AirSoft, don't buy this gun because it is made of cheap plastic! I am about to throw mine in the garbage!"
5,sweet gun,first of all im not a kid but this gun is friggin awesome!!!!!!! it was alot of shipping but 100% worth it shiped in 2 days and everything works great no need for scope when you have the laser but who cares! excellent buy!!!
2,"Good for targets, thats about all","This gun is very accurate...to about 30 feet.Its okay for messing around in your back yard, but if you want to play against friends with this gun, they'll destroy you.Its not powerful at all:I tried playing with it and my friends could literally see the bb coming and dodge it.Don't be fooled. Definitely go for the electric guns, even if they're more expensive."
3,My Pistol Is Better,"I guess what other people say is right; ""what you pay for is what you get"". I got this LE CA 870 Shotgun thing and when it arrived, I opened it. Of course i expected something better and not a big piece of cheap plastic. My pistol is around 3 times as heavy. The scope is high about 3 inches and the laser is no use (fun to play with though). The gun shoots hard 280 fps...but if you're looking for decent accuracy then, NOT this gun. The scope is also very wiggly and easy to fall off. The mag. stores over 50 rounds of bbs which is really good. You need to take of the scope in order to put the bbs in which is a little frustrating. However it is easy to load and fun to play with..."
4,A moving musical memoir,"An involving and moving documentary, with great music, about the almost-lost klezmer tradition of Eastern Europe."
2,misleading picture,"This product shows a picture from a ""twin pack of 300 tablets"" which is misleading because the product is only ONE bottle of 300 tabs."
3,Not as strong as I'd hoped,This magnet holds a metal mesh file system that weighs about 7 lbs at most and it just slides off. I had to supplement with 2 more magnets.
1,Long-winded. Wordy. Hard to read past page twenty.,Like I said in my summary. Long-winded. Wordy. Hard to read past page twenty.
1,Herzog is boring and confusing,"From page 1 to page 325 I really didn't get interested in it. It was long, boring and, confusing."
2,Herzog is a bore whore,"At the risk of sounding uncultured, I would like to state that Saul Bellow's ""Herzog"" is about as exciting as a Lars Von Trier film. That is to say that it dragged for days which become weeks which became months which became days again. This was my first attempt at a Saul Bellow novel and I was shaking with excitement. I did not see this paper-bound coma coming. At about pg 96 my heart stopped. I vow never to read Saul Bellow again. The world is abundant with stimulating novels, why waste my time on the literary equivelant of shaving.Note: Some passages of this novel were beautifully crafted. But still. . . . ."
5,"Battered by Life, But not Quite Defeated","I loved Herzog!I think some reviewers took it a little too seriously. Dysfunctional, lovable Moses Herzog is a brilliant but scattered thinker who has been put through the ringer of human existence, being tortured and exploited by his estranged, witchy spouse, mercilessly.Trying to ""think"" his way out of his problems, he falters repeatedly because his skill-set is too esoteric. He needs practical solutions for his vexations, but his mind, rather than coming to the rescue to save him, takes him on a series of delusional and hallucinatory excursions -- which motivate him to try, quixotically, to exact revenge and settle scores against his perceived foes.It's almost like a brainiac version of Don Quixote. But it's not super-easy reading. When Moses starts writing letters and waxing philosophically, you might need your wading boots to slog through those sections.All in all, I massively enjoyed my first Bellow novel and look forward to reading the rest."
4,Compassionate fool,"Herzog is a compassionate fool, analyzing his life looking for the problem, when his self-analysis (self-absorption, really) IS the problem. Though Bellow portrays him as absurd, comical, foolish, and sometimes trivially hypocritical, the author never fails in his own compassion for Herzog.This novel is brilliantly characterized, with lovely details that make my spine tingle. But it is a little too long - I think Bellow could have painted this portrait of Herzog in half the pages if he had really been inspired. Thus many folks will find it too long or pointless. It's a pity, because it's worth sticking with to the end."
2,Cannot touch Augie March,"I agree with the negative reviews of this book. Herzog never becomes a fully realized character and it's impossible to care about him or, ultimately, this novel. Herzog seems, to me, a vehicle for the author to spout; at times he is just a mouthpiece to show off how much the author has read. That makes the main character almost literally paper-thin. The end happens so abruptly that one would think that he missed something somewhere, or that 20 pages were cut out. But by that time, anyway, we've stopped caring. I maintain that, had this book not been written by Bellow, it would no longer still be in print. I would say that this is a minor work by a somewhat overrated author. If you haven't read The Adventures of Augie March or Seize the Day, do so. If you have, then skip this book."
2,Bellow-Par,It is stunning that this book won the 1965 National Book Award. It is as tedious as it is trite. One of Bellow's most average efforts.
1,Struggling to finish this awful book,"This book will not defeat me - I will finish every turgid page of this pretentious tripe, although it will probably leave me in an insane asylum. I really cannot recommend this book to anyone - I would like to say I could offer it to an insomniac but the book makes me so frustrated and angry at its sheer awfulness that it would likely be counter-productive. Just page, after page, after of the main characters navel gazing and self pity, studded with references to Hegel and Spinoza - his 'insight' into the human condition.Reading this book is like being stuck in a bar with a depressed philosophy major who is blocking your access to the bar whilst - at length- telling you all his 'interesting' thoughts on life. Just UGH."
3,A necessary lesson on life?,"Is Herzog a necessary lesson on life? One reviewer has suggested that everyone should read it as a lesson on life. The real question is Bellow's relationship to objectivity in Herzog. Nabokov has stated that it is childish to see the author in his art; however, I cannot help but to see a postmodern struggle in the character of Herzog. Has Bellow seperated himself from his main character? Is the result (which is a wonderful characterization)worth it? The relevence of Moses Herzog to the reader is in question."
3,An Intelligent Man With No Sense,"Do you know anyone who has the brains of a college professor but lives life like a moron? Meet Moses Herzog, age 47. After divorcing a good wife he married Satan's sister. When she was done cheating on him, abusing him, and throwing him out, he got involved with pretty Ramona. But he doesn't know whether or not to marry her. Have no fear - whatever decision he makes is bound to be the wrong one. Will he find happiness? I doubt it. Will he lose his mind? What mind? Saul Bellow, are you a sick puppy?"
3,"Superb writing, but self-centred","This book is such an established classic, that a little criticism is certainly not going to harm its reputation. The quality of the writing is superb: it is a pleasure simply reading prose of such quality, of encountering a novelist who can pace and structure so finely a work as complex as this. Yet, I was repelled by the constant tone of self-pity. I do not know the extent to which this novel is autobiographical, but the fact that Herzog is a middle-aged Jewish intellectual naturally links him with the author. The whole tenor of the novel seems to say: ""Isn't life tough when you're a middle-aged intellectual like myself?"" To which the obvious answer must surely be ""No, not really"". A novelist ought to be interested in the world around him."
4,Eponymy should stand as a warning,"Crisp dialogue, simultaneously expressing the gruff true-to-life-grit that collects under the fingernails of experienced hands and the searing lucidity characteristic of philosophic dictum compels you to find the anti-protagonist Herzog both enviable and detestable. Hidden beneath the thick veneer of anachronistic jargon, antiquated notions, and romanticized existence of a rogue academic lays a rich personification of interiority, a fictional character completely supported by a consistent stream of soul-searching, existence-rending, utterly disquieting soliloquies. The story rambles at times, preaches at times, but never lets you find your footing in this fictional fountainhead of self-reflection."
5,Bellows Writes Humorous but Compelling Work,"This is my 3rd book in the top 10 bestsellers of the year I was born, 1964.I have to agree with the review of Mr Friedman that this book is very humorous in a lot of areas. Saul Bellows has a great sense of humor. Although, of course, there is points of great feeling and emotions of what Herzog went through in his marriages and failed relationships. I appreciated Mr. Bellows style of writing. It was very incredibly written. Actually, he is a very educated writer, which seems to be very rare in this day and age. Well, of course, this book was written decades ago, it seems. It took a little bit for me to actually get in to it but once I did, I couldn't put it down. It went everywhere with me (work, Dr. appts). Please read, it is worth it!"
3,Just okay!,"I am about halfway through this, which I'm slogging through for my reading group. I would never have chosen such a one, it being a book that is thought to be ""enlightening."" However one must admit that Saul Bellow, as an author, has a way with words and descriptions. Herzog is an unlikeable character, neurotic, selfish, without much to recommend him. And he is the only one! I am a writer myself and have more respect for the reader than to bore him silly with a mono-character book. The descriptions are good and I certainly have read books, under pressure, I admit, that are worse. It is definitely not a light read. I'm sorry that this is damning with faint praise, but so be it!"
3,Successful but underwhelming,"Moses Herzog is a failed academic, twice divorced, and facing the impenetrable wall of his own misdoings. He writes letters obsessively, to both living and dead beings. The late Saul Bellow is competent in his mosaic of action and letter-stream of consciousness, though the supplemental characters never manage to rise above the clutter of Herzog's internal voice. A fine portrait of Jewish cultural life in Chicago emerges as Bellow interweaves a sophisticated portrait of academic life in the mid-60's. Still, I couldn't remove the impression that Bellow's writing is entirely too clean, too composed, and lacks the courage to leap off the perimeters of his canvas."
3,"Excellent Writing, Boring Book",I bought Herzog because I wanted a book on madness. My bad. Seize the Day fits the bill much better. Saul Bellow is a brilliant wordsmith but he does not produce particular provocative books. Herzog is flat. I didn't even finish the book. So Herzog gets three stars because Saul Bellow is a writing god but the book fails to attain glory.
4,Amazingly meticulous dissection of real life,"This wasn't what I'd call a lot of fun to read. But it was worth it!I am in awe of Bellow's ability to gather together the tiny impressions, thoughts, and actions that compose our lives and relationships and build them into something resembling a plot. His main character wants the reader to know everything about how he feels, and he succeeds in getting it across. In the end, I felt like I knew Moses Herzog and wanted to have him over for drinks, just to enjoy his eccentric company.A terrific book of masterful craftsmanship."
2,Worthless,"I have this unit and the first one displayed double the voltage on my car. Called the seller and they had stopped selling them due to returns, but sent me a replacement anyway. On the second one the voltage flip-flops from 12-15 to 26 volts. Yanked it out of the car and its going in the trash.As well the temp probe is a joke. Driving in the summer yesterday I stuck the probe in the A/C vent to see how cold my air conditioning was. It went from 86 (outside air temp reading) to 94 degrees while the air conditioning was turned on! My hand thermometer display was showing 46 degrees, so another part of this silly thing is not working.Absolutely worthless. Am here on Amazon to find something that works and will not be buying another one of these."
3,Good for an everyday watch,This is a good watch for every day. Pretty yet practical. The luninous dial comes in handy.
2,It's all Greek to me!,"I bought this book because my Doctor recommended a Mediterranean Diet for heart health. It is a big book, full of recipies and asides about living in Mediterranean countries. That part was interesting. However, I found the recipies way too ethnic for our use. They use many ingredients that can not be found in our South-Western community. Also, most of them don't even appeal to me. I did read it cover to cover and tried to glean from it some basics of a Mediterranean Diet that I could try to apply to our circumstances. In that respect, it was helpful."
4,Excellent,"I can hardly wait to try many if not most of receipts, I've scanned through it and decided there are many I want to try. I'd recommend this book and have already."
3,The Book is O.K.,"Honestly, I have to say that I am not pleased with the recipes I've tried so far. I like spicy and tasty food, but the recipes I have tried so far were surprisnly lacking flavor. However, it appears that the author has done a good job of finding recipes from all over the Mediterranea region. Unfortunately they are not to my liking. But I could just be choosing all the wrong ones."
4,Mediterranean Diet Cookbook: A Delicious Alternative for Lifelong Health,Bought the book used. Seller said book was in good condition and the book looked like new.Very happy with the transaction.
4,Mediterranean Cookbook,"The book appears to have simple,readily available ingredients but I purchased it as a gift for a friend so honestly have not used it myself."
2,I'm unimpressed.,"The book is boring. No pictures to help visualize the recipes. This book found a new way to tell you, (eat more fruits and vegetables)."
1,Didn't answer my question,"Recipes are oke, but I already have a lot of those. I wanted to learn exactly what is the mediterranean diet and what exactly are the benefits. I expected more background and scientific information.If you want to know more about foodscience, you better read Good calories, bad calories, written by Gary Taubes."
5,Mediterranean Diet Cookbook - A Delicious Alternative For Life Long Health,I love this book. The recipes are simple and easy to prepare. The author explains the thinking behind everything and also tells you how recipes can be easily adapted. The produce and ingredients are for the most part readily available and it is so comprehensive. I have looked through many other recipe books covering this way of eating and found this was by far the best.
3,Too wordy and no pictures,"I was disappointed in this book and sent it right back for two reasons. One, it's very, very wordy. I like cookbooks that tell you how to cook the dish without so much reading. Secondly, I like a few pictures, preferably in color, but at least a few sketches. Some of the recipes looked interesting, but I'm sure I can find them in a cookbook that's more user-friendly."
2,Barely a good read.,"It was a struggle to get through this book by Ed Gorman. I had previously read and enjoyed ""Wake Up Little Susie"" with all its nostalgia. ""Murder on the Aisle"" seemed way too contrived at times and I was really put off by the many, many typos in my Kindle version. It made me wonder if an editor acutally read the final product -- VERY SLOPPY!"
2,Movie buffs might like...,"As a movie buff, I enjoyed the references sprinkled throughout the novel. The main character kind of grew on me as well. However, it is difficult to take amateur sleuth stories seriously at times where they set out to discover the murderer's identity on their own. An OK book that had its moments + a couple of surprises. It was hard to really care about the majority of the characters though."
4,Superior Coverage,I completely disagree with the previous review. These diapers are awesome! They absorb lots of fluid without leakage if fastened correctly...just like baby diapers.Would definitely recommend these to people that are looking for diapers that have superior protection.
2,ATN Brief,"Was very disappointed, they leaked. was not satisfactory compaired to the Diaper type. i will not re order on these am on fixed income and have to buy what workes."
4,The Totem Pole - Unputdownable,After 'Deep Play' I was keen to read more of Paul Pritchard's work. Paul writes with a great deal of honesty and in a way which makes you want to keep on reading - his varied style never becoming dull. The book is less about climbing than his recovery from a horrific brain injury sustained whilst pursuing that passion (although the account of the incident itelf is quite gripping).His grit and determination to regain a life in some way resembling what he lost in Tasmania is truly commendable but perhaps not surprising given the way he approached climbing and life in general. His account of the physical and mental struggles along with the people (patients and medical staff) who become fixtures of his new world is both humorous and touching.
4,Liked this Book alot,"This is a high recommend. I only read it because there's been so much talk about it in my circle, and it far surpassed my expectations. As someone who has struggled with my weight, it has not been easy for me to think about starting a new diet plan. My weight is a sensitive issue for me, and I have struggled with it multiple times in the past. The book's plan is simple and doesn't require you go out and buy a lot of products or anything. It seems like the book is written because the author generally cares about helping people not only lose weight but improve their health."
5,Automatic Reaction,"This book changed the way I looked at dieting. It helped me see that instead of being a punishment for letting my weight get out of control, a diet only corrects poor choices that I had been making. By using this new approach to food I was able to see where I had gotten off track. It made me realize that keeping my weight in control is something that I can do long term rather than yo-yoing from trying diet after diet. I see how making good choices can become part of my daily routine - something I can do with less effort.Not sure why Anonymous reviewed a book he/she didn't read, but I think the other reviews are definitely on target, and more in line with my experience which was only positive."
5,de-automate your eating behaviors,This book goes a long way to help us understand eating behavior and how to break unhealthy habits and develop healthy ones
3,"Not to bring down the rating, but read this.","I'm not trying to bring down this products rating, but this stuff is a Bi*ch to work with. It really works well, but it sticks to your tools like glue, and is nearly impossible to get into any holes that aren't somewhat flat (like a hood etc) I have tried NUMEROUS times with many different methods to get this stuff to do its job, but all i've gotten is a caked on mess that has ruined my paint. If you need body work done, get a professional to do it, or get some kind of gun you can ""inject"" it with. No matter feel free to buy this product if you have lots and LOTS of gusto to get messy"
5,relaxation cd,"This cd is a recording of a thunder storm without accompanying music. if you're looking for a good white noise generator to sleep with, or background sounds to relax by, this is what you want. the lack of musical accompaniment is a big plus as it doesn't lock you into a pattern"
1,Only 2 mins of Thunder!!,I was very disappointed with this CD...when I first played it I thought something was wrong..there was about 30 seconds (seems like longer) of blank for Volume reference tone...then 2 mins of thunder and then simple rain for 30 mins...WITH NO THUNDER!! It's not a thunderstorm at all! If you want a thunderstorm...look elsewhere.
4,"Worth buying, could be even better.","This song is a real mix of styles and sounds. Most of the songs are okay...worth listening to, but nothing superb. With the exception of FireDance. This song alone brings this CD up to 4 stars. With the superb guitar playing of Daryl Stuermer (from Genesis) and the delightful flute playing of Douglas Spotted Eagle, this song stands above the rest and makes the CD worth the price. It has a wonderful Native American feel with a fair amount of rock mixed in. Superb."
4,"They were great, and now they're greater!","This DVD was great, but any glimpse into the life of Tegan and Sara is great. I must say I did wish the video was a little more structured, but I can suck it up. It was awesome! Can't wait until they start touring again."
1,Waterpik Model WP-360W,This item carries too little water to do a good job. Other wise it is of good quality.
3,"Good Product, but Double-Billed [and Sent]","A good enough product that dentists still recommend. . but why oh why does Amazon send it and bill me twice. I ordered it to go to a different address but they sent it to both my regular one and the second, billing me twice. Their error, my $25 or so extra. Worse, no clear way to remove the second address from my file. Result: Anything else I ever buy apparently gets double-billed and double-sent. Hence, no more buying by this person from AMAZON."
4,Practical,"The waterpik is wonderful, great for travels, as gifts and very practical! I will buy another one!"
4,Great while it lasted !,"Did the job fantastically for the first 6 months then it gradually started to die. After 11 months I read it it's last rites and chunked it in the garbage can . I'd buy another one, if it was under $20.00 like I paid for this one, knowing that it's a throw away item after 11 months.Rated it 4 stars because I was very pleased with the product while it worked."
1,Works but unreliable,"The waterpik idea is fantastic and has helped me bring my teeth and gums into perfect condition (along with flossing, stimudents, electric Oral B toothbrush, and Listerine). But, my first one of these died after a few months. I am now on the second and it is showing signs of trouble after about 5 months. There is some design flaw or cheap parts in these and I would not recommend anyone spending their money on it until they fix these."
3,Water Pik,I am happy with this item but wish that the on-off switch was a little easier to use. I tend to send water all over the sink and walls.
3,Good and useful,"I buy and use one of this, and I think is good. It is easy to use, you can wash your tooth under the shower, no problem with high voltage in bath. The minus point is for long time to charge. You need more then ten hours for recharge battery, time when you cannot use it. So, in that time your tooth can suffer. But generally I think it is good deserve money."
4,Waterpik Waterflosser,"This waterflosser is lightweight,easy to use and takes up minimal space on my vanity counter. It stays charged throughout numerous uses. The only drawback is that it is difficult to see the amount of water that is in the chamber."
2,Not for me,"This item looks good on the counter. It does not hold enough liquid. You have to hold it in an awkward position to completely empty it, meanwhile it's dripping everywhere and making a mess. The switches are right under your fingers, unless of course you mean to turn it off every few seconds, you can move your hand to hold it, and really feel awkward while using it. I cannot and will not recommend this item to anyone.Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS"
2,Battery Doesn't Charge After 6 Months,"I liked using Waterpik until it totally wouldn't charge after 6 months use. The strong water pulses seem like a good idea, but there is still no substitute for regular floss that can reach more areas and is less messy."
1,Immediately broke,"After only one month of use, it wouldn't charge any more. Worked great until then, for the price. But if it breaks so quick, it's worthless. I'm pretty unhappy about this product."
2,"Too Much Bulk, Too Little Benefit","I have been looking for a new portable WaterPik since my travel-sized one died a few years ago. The cordless looks like a nice, streamlined machine, but it handles awkwardly, especially if you have arthritis. The water source doesn't hold enough to do a thorough job and adds to the bulk of the device. I miss the mini-Water Pik."
3,Squirty,"I found this product to be good but not great. I honestly thought it would be easy to use, but it squirted water all over the place. I had to consistently clean my bathroom mirrors."
2,Head spins freely - hard to target it,"Pro: PortablePro: Nice handle size for smaller handsCon: Doesn't hold enough waterCon: The spray nozzel spins freely on the base so in addition to holding the device with one hand, you have to use your other hand to keep the spray nozzel from flipping the wrong direction in your mouth and watering your bathroom or spraying an eye.I purchased this one and at the same time I bought a Showerbreeze that installs on your shower head. After using both, I prefer the Showerbreeze that I installed on my shower head."
4,Very good product,"This new version of pic and charger combo worked much better than previous model. It now holds a charge for several uses, and seems to have more blasting power, perhaps due to better battery design."
2,doesn't last very long,"I bought this at a retail store near me for about 30 bucks after tax. I really did like it at first, and I'd have given it four stars if I'd have gotten around to reviewing it during that first week or so. Now, about three or four months later, it just stopped working. I fully expect any device I buy to last longer than that, so I can't give it any more than two stars. I'm not giving it one star, because it was my first dental irrigator, and the experience was positive enough that I'm going to buy another. But not another one by this manufacturer, I'm looking for something now that'll last more than a few months."
3,Water Pik,This is my third water pik. They seem to work for several months and then won't hold a charge. Not real pleased.
4,Healthy Gums and Clean Teeth,"I bought this water flosser to replace an older one that the battery had worn out on. That one worked for 4 years without incident. I could have replaced the battery but chose to buy a new model. I cannot live without my Waterpic. My gums and teeth are healthy and it does an excellent job cleaning around crowns and an implant. The battery on this model holds a charge for about a week's worth of cleanings without having to recharge. My older model seemed to have a longer battery life but this is sufficient. I just plug it in overnight every weekend. The water reservoir holds just enough to do your mouth once. If you need more water it is easy to refill. The amount of water pressure is good, enough to clean but not so much that you hurt sensitive gum tissues. I highly recommend this product."
1,Sandra,"It was great at first. Loved it, loved it. Then after 4 months it just stopped. It cost too much to only last 4 months. Won't buy another one like it. Too bad, good concept, poor construction..."
3,"Bulky, Messy, Short Charge Life",Despite the mentioned drawbacks of this waterflosser it accomplished what flossing alone could not and that was reversal of gingivitis after several weeks of daily use.It is particularly effective in removing food particles from under bridgework and from gum pockets. Usually requires more than one filling to do an adequate job.
3,Are waterpiks suppose to be messy?,"My first time using a waterpik, it was recommended by my dentist but water gets every where,are they suppose to be that messy?"
4,Great for braces!,"I got this because my 9-year-old daughter had a pallet expander installed by the orthodontist, and she was sounding like a cat coughing up a hairball every night at dinner because she was getting food stuck in her orthodontia. It's really nasty.Trust me.I didn't want the full size waterpik because I read all the reviews about kids pulling on the hose and the whole thing crashing to the floor. My kids would do that..So I got the cheaper cordless model.... and it works great. It has plenty of power to blast sticky rice and bits of chicken right out of the pallet expander and braces. I can also hit the dog with a concentrated stream of water from 25 feet away (bonus).Nice tool for the price. I'm glad I didn't get the newer model at twice the price. This one was under $30 and works like a champ."
1,Bad overall,"I have had 3 or 4 of these, sometimes replaced within the warranty BUT, either the connection quits or the battery is gone. I noticed that the warranty on the newest one is only one year instead of 2. I am not surprised as it quits working even though I keep it plugged in even when in use. Wouldn't buy except I need it for travel, using the larger one at home.Disappointed in Hawaii!"
1,GARBAGE! LASTED LESS THAN 1 WEEK!!,"I use the regular (full-size) Waterpik at home, but bought this one for travel. Wasn't nuts about its small capacity (had to refill it at least 3 or 4 times each time I used it) and the fact that it had only one pressure setting, but couldn't bring the full-sized one, so I got this one. Well, as some other reviewers stated, it had to be held pretty much upright for it to work, so that was awkward but do-able. LESS THAN ONE WEEK after I started using it (after having followed the charging instructions to a T), it stopped working!! I thought initially that maybe I hadn't let it charge enough (3-4 hrs) after the initial charge, so I let it charge overnight but it STILL held minimal (and not enough to use it) charge. I then charged it for a longer period overnight, and now it's pretty much DEAD!! Definitely not useable at all - WHAT A PIECE OF CR*P!!"
2,"It's OK, not great.","Contrary to other reviewers, mine has lasted for about 2 years. Technically it's still working but I'm going to have to buy something different. It only really worked well for the first two months, and then became rather weak. No amount of charging brings back the power it initially had.I guess you get what you pay for. My gums need top notch cleaning to stay healthy and this device just isn't really doing it. Plus, the well is so small I have to refill at LEAST twice... more like 4 times to attempt to do a good job. I think I'm going to have to move up to the corded versions with the large tanks."
2,Waterpik,"The reservoir is only about 3 oz. So you end up having to refill it to finish cleaning. The pressure seems a little weak compared to the Waterpik Ultra home unit. Ok for trips but otherwise, I'd stick with the regular Waterpik Ultra for home use."
2,What a disappointment for the price!,"This is my first device of this nature and I really did not know what to buy, so the flexibility of having a battery powered unit was appealing. I thought that would offset the smaller tank size. What a mistake. I have to refill the tank 3-4 times to do my teeth and the unit is soaked completely by the time I am finished which can't be good for it long term. Also, for the price paid I expected more. I replaced this one immediately with a Conair Interplak Water Jet for $10 (vs. $35 for the Water Pik). If you have to get a Water Pik because of the name, get the large unit."
1,broke after 2 weeks,"This item stopped functioning within two weeks of its arrival at my home. To be fair, after e mailing the Waterpik company, they agreed to send another Waterpik to me after 15 days (to date the item has not arrived). The water reservoir is too small for the unit, and requires two fills, at least, to properly cleanse the teeth and gums. The charger ran out after one or two uses, even the first few days, in spite of the fact that I charged it for 16 hours the first time, as advised in the instruction manual, and had to be recharged again over night. This item is made in China, home of (lately) massive product recalls all over the world. This item lacks product integrity, certainly won't improve China's current standing in the world of manufacturing, and, I think, the Waterpik company lacks integrity for selling this thing. Maybe their other products are good. This one isn't."
1,Doesn't age well,"Have to agree with the various reviews citing the unit's poor battery performance after a few months of use. I've stepped up to a countertop WaterPik and like it much better. I'd still like one for travel, so I might try the Panasonic that takes regular batteries - it would be a lot easier to pack a set or two of rechargeables and know I'd have enough power when I need it."
2,Great While It Lasted,"I bought this pik as recommended by my dentist 3 months ago. I loved it and was very pleased with its performance, however...it only lasted 3 months. Now it will not turn on when the on button is engaged. I have a feeling it is because of the design of the on/off buttons. I ordered the bigger one with the reservoir to replace it, hoping that that one will not crater so quickly. It's a good product, but the company needs to work on its longevity."
2,"It works great for 2 months, that was it!","This item is a very neat idea, portable and rechargeable, although it doesn't hold much water in the tank, I don't mind filling it up twice every time I use it. The jet stream is very powerful, it does an excellent job of cleaning between my teeth, it certainly feels cleaner than flossing. For 2 months or so I thought I had bought the best consumer product ever, until one day it just stopped working. It turned out that the socket for the charger was completely rusted. My advice is DO NOT buy this product, wait for WaterPik to come up with a better model!"
1,Poor excuse for a water pik,"This product was a big disappointment. We hated it from the beginning. We've used water piks for many years and were mostly satisfied, except for the short life of the machines. This one didn't even perform when it was working. The reservoir was too small and the machine was so weak that we never felt that we were getting the benefit of an irrigation system. Then, after just a few months, it stopped working."
2,waterpik,"Very frustrated with this product. I have a couple of them, and both stopped recharging after a couple of months. Other than that, I like the product, but for this reason I would not recommend it."
3,Hand-held great for travel),"The product is great for travel , put I would not recomend for daily use. The charge has held for 2 weeks. The water container only holds enough water to do about half the mouth, So you need to refill a few time to do a good job. Also the presure is not adjustible like a normal water pik, you can adjust only by changing the heads on the product. It does work, but I would prefer a traditional unit for daily use."
2,Too much hassle,"I just got one and was excited that it's cordless, but it doesn't hold enough water and it's a hassle to fill through the small tall container on the side. I'm going back to the plug in one that has the very large water container and smaller unit to hold in your mouth also"
2,battery died after about 4 months,Battery died after 4 months of use. I believe I charged it regularly and had a good maintainance.
1,"Convenient, but not effective","Great idea. But the water pressure was so low, that I had to use floss anyway. Would not recommend it."
4,We like 'em.,"I bought two, one for each bathroom. After a month of use, we like 'em, particularly the hand held size. Plenty of oomph, without the counter space problem of the bigger models. It does have a smaller reservoir, so no dawdling, but you can get all eight banks of teeth done in one fill-up if you turn it off to switch hands. We find the location of the on/off buttons very convenient."
3,Good tool -- easier than flossing,"1. It is portable, so I can take it into the washroom at work and clean my teeth, but easy to keep secure in my locker.2. It works very well getting stuff out from between my teeth.3. I have to fill it up at least twice, each time I use it.4. I have to use warm water, otherwise it makes my teeth hurt.The charger was a little iffy to start with, but I was able to figure out how to get the plug in the socket just right so it will charge properly. It would be nice to be able to tell if it is charging, like so many other cordless devices, by having an LED indicator."
2,Was good while it worked,"It worked well for the first 6 months or so. Then, water stopped coming out of it. I opened it to take a look at what the problem is and found that one of the plastic parts has warn down. This has only been used for about 6 month and that tells you how poor quality the parts used are."
1,Bad product.,Don't waste your money on this thing. The battery does not hold a charge. The operation is poor. Mine died after less than a year. Waterpik should be ashamed to have put this on the market. But some other brand...like the Panasonic EW-1270.
2,No thanks,"Pro: Compact, does the job and inexpensiveCons: reservoir must be refilled several times to complete the job.Unless you have very limited counter space or wish to stick this in your suitcase, spend a few more bucks and get the Ultra. On second thought- if you are that concerned with your dental care- spring for the bigger one and get a bigger suitcase.Waterpik products do not seem to be as durable but they are still great as long as they do last"
1,Its great unless you want to use it,"Just purchased the waterpik. Never got to use it. Charged it the first time as instructed, filled the reservoir, inserted the tip and turned it on. It blew the tip off each time. E-mailed Waterpik, and explained the problem. Their solution- take it back. I did..."
2,Disappointment,"I am very disappointed in this product. The water chamber is way too small and I have to refill it twice before I am through cleaning my teeth. I should have bought the full size waterpik, like I bought for my Mom. Don't waste your money on this one, go for the full size waterpik as it is a great dental hygiene tool."
2,Not enough power,"I thought this was great for a few weeks. But the forcefulness, even with the stronger tip, diminishes within a day. Plus, the section the holds the water gets moldy pretty fast, since it's not washable. I found I was filling it with vinegar in between uses to keep it fresh. Look elsewhere."
3,"like most goods, cr@ps out after about a year","This isn't a bad product, but like most big company goods, it is built to simply barely outlast it's warranty, so you will have to replace it, thereby ensuring high profits for those corporations who build them overseas at extremely low overhead then sell them at high markup."
1,Battery does not last,"After a few weeks, you'll need to replace it because even if you charge the battery every night, it just looses so much power it becomes useless"
2,not at all happy with product,"the water-pick I purchased is not at all to my satisfaction. It is clumsy to handle, won't hold a charge, water tank to small. I had water-picks before but not the hand held pick. I would not recomend it to anyone, not even for travel."
3,Hopefully will last longer than the last one,"This is the second one of these I have purchased. I really liked the first one but it unfortunately stopped working after only a few months. I do wish the water reservoir was bigger, as I have to stop to refill it halfway through using it."
2,Poor battery,"Worked great for about 5 months. After that, the battery could not hold a charge, even if it was plugged in 24 hours a day. I would not buy this again."
1,Junk. Owned for 2 months then tossed.,"I had mine for a couple of months and then I threw it in the trash. It was unwieldy, had minimal water pressure, and the jet tip wouldn't stay in place. It didn't add anything to my oral hygeine and it was taking up space on the counter. Waste of money."
4,Good product,"This is a well designed product that works well to clean between teeth. Compared to other similar products I have had this one is small which encourages use. I took off one star because I have not been able to keep the top part stationary in my mouth. It still works fine, though"
1,Battery Life Sucks,Do NOT buy this product. I have had it for a little under a month and it no longer keeps a charge. Even when trying to use the product while it is still plugged up does not work. Before this it worked fine and the battery life was actually pretty long I only needed to charge it a couple of days. I have wasted $20 bucks on this things because it no longer works.
1,Yet another Bad Battery review,"I wish I had read all these reviews before purchasing this Waterpik -- I never would have done it. You can add my complaints of a faulty battery to the mix. I love the concept and the operation of the flosser, it's just a pity it is so badly constructed that quick breakdown is inevitable, not an exception. Mine worked for about a month before the battery started running out of its charge; and another month when it stopped recharging altogether. I'm surprised there wasn't a recall, but at $20 I guess no one thought it worth the effort. Still, I'm glad I saw these reviews. I might have gotten a second one on the hope that the first lemon was just a fluke. It's not. AVOID."
1,did not like,too tall to fill using the bathroom sink. Very messy. Tip kept rotating which made it hard to reach the places I wanted to. Bulky. doesn't hold enough liquid.
1,(Relatively) expensive piece of junk cluttering up my tiny bathroom counter,"This device is awful. What I now realize is light use (2/3 of a reservoir used twice a day by one person) runs the battery down in 3 days, after 3 months of use. Initially the charge would last about 5 or 6 days, but no more. I hate this thing -- the recharge period is so long (16 hours) that I can't use it every 6th or 8th time that my dentist recommends that I do so. In addition, it is so much longer compared to other chargers that I use for my cellphone, blackberry, rechargeable batteries for flashlights and shower and other portable radios, that I have actually seen my electric bill increase. DO NOT BUY THIS! I have replaced it with a standard water pik that plugs into the wall."
4,Great for what it is...Small and Portable!,"I bought this just prior to getting braces. I am in my 30's so I know what I need to do to keep my braces clean and was looking for something that wasn't bulky but would work well. After promptly breaking the high power tip because I didn't read directions I figured out how to use it properly with the low power.It fishes all the gunk out and helps my mouth feel cleaner as well as clean out the braces so that they continue to dig into my cheeks and tongue. I have now broken the low power tip and just ordered replacements (cheaper on Amazon even with shipping than at the waterpik store) and I miss using it already.Yes I have to refill it, but it's portable - isn't the point of being cordless/portable making it small enough to carry around? I took it on vacation and it lasted all week with no recharge. I (knock on wood) have not had any issue with the battery and no, I don't drain it all the way first."
1,Do Not Buy This Waterpick!!,"I bought this Waterpick In January 2008 it lasted until March 2008. I took it to a repair shop the repairman open it up it was all full of rust. The motor, battery where all shot. Don't buy this artical. You will be sorry."
2,Works Great - sort of,I've owned the product 3 months. I purchased this product because I'm a middle aged person with braces and found the full size water pik setup to be invaluable dealing with the situation. If this product didn't have the following shortcomings I'd rate it 5 stars because it is a tool I use every day. Design issue #1: The battery. The water pressure just isn't there anymore and this thing is only 3 months old. As it runs you can hear it slow down as it pumps the water #2 The charger inlet falls open easily and water gets in the charging area. BAD. #3. There is no good way to clean out the water holder and it goes stale. I've taken to flushing it with mouth wash and storing it open and upside down.
1,compromised,"After a month's use (in the shower) and perhaps 5 rechargings, the unit failed. I took it apart to find electronics fine but motor grinding when hand-rotated. It was never pleasant to use - needs to be operated held vertically, refilled every 30 seconds, and recharging was awkward with no stand, no charging indicator, and an ominous warning not to charge while switched on - but the on-off switch is tactile (and unlabelled)."
3,water pik,Good as it gets the job done without too much recharging.It however needs more that one speed & the attachments are all nearlly the same intensity. Should be more of a variation.Rick
2,Hope I just got a bad one,"Have had this product apx 2 months. It was a great tool to keep my teeth clean however it has quit working already. Also, could use a little larger water reservoir so you have a little more time to use it without having to refill it."
2,"Good idea, but poor powered!","Battery dies early. If you do not need a portable water pick, prefer to buy the cord powered model. The cordless model WP-360W is underpowered, and is not possible change the NiCd battery."
1,An utter disgrace,I have been using water pik products for over 25 years. This is a disgrace. The water pressure is somewhat poorer than from a slow leak in a faucet. The amount of water it holds is so small that it needs cosntant refilling. The only person who should get this product is someone who wants his or her teeth to rot. This product is worthless. Water-pik should be ashamed. This system doesn't have a sufficiently negative entry for this product.
1,Poorly thought out product,"After buying it, I used this for 1 week during a river rafting trip. Worked well. 2 years later, I want to use it for another river rafting trip. Except the battery won't hold a charge. AND YOU CANNOT REPLACE THE BATTERY! So I had to throw it away. THAT'S A STUPIDLY DESIGNED PRODUCT!!! Don't waste your time, get the Panasonic unit with replaceable batteries."
2,same battery issues as others,"this machine worked really well.... it was compact, and did the job. However, just like the other reviewers, I found that no matter how careful you are in your handling of this waterpik, it eventually refuses to charge. I owned 2, and each one started to lose the ability to re-charge within weeks. They seemed to last about 1-2 months before they die.I replaced this model with the larger waterpik professional, and have been happy ever since....."
1,Very Poor Battery,I had the same problem as some of the other reviews. The battery life is very short. I went through 2 of these in less than 6 months. The second one actually started burning one day when plugged in. Luckly I was in the bathroom when it started smoking and then the plastic started melting around the battery compartment. I quicky unplugged and submerged in water to stop the burning. I would not advise anyone to leave this unattended while charging.
1,Fool me once ... fool me three times...?!,"I wish I had read these reviews a few months ago. The family dentist recommended a water pik so I just bought this one. After a few months it stopped working so I just bought another because I thought it was because we had taken it on vacation with us (and had got banged about in the suitcase!?!). The second one stopped working after just a few weeks. I was trying to find the time and energy to write to the manufacturers when ... my husband bought a THIRD! (At time of writing it is still working but it is only a matter of time) The worst thing is that we kept none of the receipts, warranty info ... so we are posting this to warn others .... let our stupidity be a lesson to you! It's embarrassing, really ......"
2,replacement noisy and less powerful,"This is a replacement for one that lasted 10+ years. This one sounds like a threshing machine, is not as powerful, difficult to seat, therefore leaks.What happened to Waterpik? Made in China now?Wish I knew what to replace it with."
3,Mini Water Pik,"It's neither as easy to use or efficient as the regular model, but it takes up less counter space and does a fairly good job of dislodging food hiding between teeth. However, mine was sent from factory missing one tip, and the company has yet (several weeks have passed since being notified) contacted me or sent me the second tip. Each tip allows a different amount of water pressure to be applied to gums."
1,WaterPik Cordless Dental Water Jet,"Although I didn't have the charging problems, I had the feeling that the unit got moldy between uses. There's no way to dry the tiny container out overnight. Who wants to cleanse with nonpharmceutical-grade mold?"
5,Waterpik wp-360W handheld cordless water jet,"I like this model much much more than the newer version developed by Waterpik. That newer model is of poorer design and has several other flaws: recharging is less efficient, parts fall off, and it seems made more cheaply."
2,"Great concept, but . . .","I have gone through 2 of these now. It works well for awhile, but then it will not hold a charge because the connection for the recharging cord gets corroded. I will say that WaterPik did stand behind the product by replacing the first one, but because of this product's design flaw, I will not get another."
4,"Great, for the price","I bought this WaterPik to replace one that died. The old one was identical and lasted about 3 years. The new one is a bit more powerful.The only drawback is that the water tank is a little small.Other reviews have complained about the battery life, but I haven't had any trouble."
1,Poor Design,"Not much power for good hydration. Messy, have to postion the unit just right to make the water flow. The stationary models which have the water resevoir on the base and not in your hand work much better. Don't recommend buying this, it's disappointing and I returned it."
1,worked great for a week !!!,"worked great for a week, then started getting less and less powerful.basically usless now. don't waste your money."
4,waterpik,"this is a replacement, wouldnt be without it, probably the only choice when it comes to waterpik u can use in the shower....."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the Water Flosser. The water lid does not close securely,-and this model does not have a charging light.I called the company and I was informed that it was defaulted and I could send it back. I guess you get what you pay got."
2,Eventually a Waste of Money!,"This product works for about 3 months and then it's a waste. It will not recharge properly, not as powerful as it was initially. For a thorough job, stick with the counter-top electric model."
5,Water flosser,Does a great job and is easy to use. This was suggested by my dentist to keep my teeth clean between check ups.
1,Disappointing Product- Buy this as a disposable,"The product did a decent job of cleaning. The non-portable unit really did work much better, but this one was portable. Stopped taking charge and dropped dead. They should sell this as a disposable product for a disposable price. Very disappointed."
1,Doesn't hold a charge,"It's an OK product for a few weeks or a few months. In my case, after about a month, it stopped holding a charge. This makes it pretty much useless and aggravating. I see this is a common review of this product."
2,Cordless Water Pik Not For us!,"Waterpik makes very quality products but this one is not for us. The water pressure is not adjustable and set so high it can actually hurt. The water volume is so great you need to refill 2-3 times to really get to all your teeth inside and out. Because of it's size and reservoir attached, you cannot tilt it correctly when water is below full for hard to reach places. Just not a User friendly device and definitely not one we want to keep. The variable units at higher prices are much better for getting the job done. They are just less portable."
1,"UNHAPPY, Don't waste your time and money","High pressure tip broke while I changed to the low pressure tip in less than two weeks.Water Pik Pressure slowly declined to a complete stop in one month.I have called WaterPik twice, their answer system has failed to xfer my calls to customer service.Comes with a one year warrranty and a 14 day money back guarantee!I'll keep you updated until I receive a refund or replacement.IMHO, Amazon might consider to dump selling this product.So far, a total waste of my time and my money!I am totally unhappy.Maybe you should AVOID this item and thank me later."
2,Cumbersome to use,"This item is very cumbersome to use due to its long body. Also due to its long body, it can not be placed directly under the sink faucet. This requires you to use another device to obtain water in, and then transfer that water into the pick. Also the pick itself moves around when being used instead of remaining stationary. I have tried to obtain new water picks from a retail store and can not find a replacement pick. Overall this product does not live up to its advertisement. This item needs to be taken off the market and reworked."
4,Replacement unit works fine,"After only a few months of use the battery in the Waterpik was unable to take and hold a charge. I called the Waterpik people and discussed the problem. After a very pleasant conversation, I was told that I would be sent a replacement Waterpik. It arrived a few days later and it works well."
2,"great, while it lasts","I can't understand how they get away with still selling these , there is obviously a huge flaw with the recharging unit. I have just thrown away my third, which lasted just over a year, but has been not charging properly for half that time. The other two lasted less time ! I keep trying as I think when it works it does a great job and I prefer it to flossing. I give up now though ."
2,Glad I didn't buy it for myself,I received this from my orthodonist when I got braces. It worked okay for awhile but then seemed to lose pressure and had to be kept plugged in between uses. It is a nice size for traveling but I much prefer the full size model I purchased lor everyday use.
4,3.5 Stars: You get what you pay for...,"For $25 it is a good product. I'm going to give this product the benefit of the doubt. To the people that say it doesn't hold enough water, the package says that it holds 30 seconds worth of continuous spray. If this isn't enough it is easy to refill, or go with a larger model (more $$$ and counter space) Also, there are many complaints about the battery. I haven't had the product long enough to comment on the life of the battery but if you FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS there shouldn't be a problem. One reviewer said they let the battery die completely to avoid it developing a memory, and that is what you should do with most rechargeable batteries. BUT the directions specifically say NOT to let the battery drain all the way on this model. Overall it is a good oral irrigator for its low price, and size. If you are unsatisfied with it take advantage of the warranty :)"
3,"Decent, but not excellent...","The power of the water flow is good, not too hard and not too soft. But the lack of any charging indicator on this Waterpik is frustrating. Even after leaving it plugged in all day it still seems to lose power in mid-cleaning. The cord that attaches into the device feels cheap and I'm never sure whether or not it is actually in there (again, no indicator light)."
1,A disappointment,"While it worked, which wasn't for very long it did a good job of removing most, though not all debrie. I would floss after using the water-flosser and would still find a very small amount of food particles. However it did impart a feeling of 'clean' and I liked using it.THE REALLY BAD: It stopped recharging in less than a year. The company replaced it with another which also stopped recharging in less than a year! The overall design is not as functional as it should be. It is difficult to take apart for cleaning or to change the tip.Bottom line: I miss using it but expensive, considering its short lived life."
1,Short life span,"I've had this waterpik for about a year and a half. After about 6 months the power diminishes and no longer charges well. Add another 6 months to a year and it no longer works unless I shake it to get the motor going. If you purchase it, I would do so with the expectation that it's going to last for about 1 year."
1,BATTERIES P L E A S E !! ! ! ! !,"Whatever was wrong with a BATTERY-POWERED * * * NON RECHARGEABLE irrigator? I had one of these for years and loved it. I don't like to have a zillion things plugged in on my bathroom counter. In the first place, there aren't enough outlets for the irrigator, the toothbrush, the hair drier, the curling iron, the shaver, etc. ad infinitum.JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN PUT 3 OR 4 AA BATTERIES IN * * * P-L-E-A-S-E * * * ! ! ! !"
1,Bad Quality Control,"Broke the 3rd time I used it. Just stopped in the middle of use, and didn't take a charge. Luckily, I received my money back from Amazon. Very dissappointed. Found it a little bulky and annoying to fill it twice to use."
1,waste of money,I have owned 2 of these water piks...both have become unchargeable in less than a year.The Panasonic cordless water pik is much better!
2,Poor electronics,After a while the unit loses its ability to retain an electrical charge. Unfortunately it is not designed to enable the user to replace the batteries. Until they can improve this aspect of the device it is not worth the investment.
2,Not enough power and water,The battery doesn't last very long but what is more frustrating is the water tank is way to small to acomplish a very through cleaning.
1,Terrible product,"This oral irrigator is so weak that it leaves behind all kinds of food particles. Yes, it's rechargeable but that doesn't matter if the water stream has no power. The other annoying thing is that the irrigator tip rotates on it's own. It's impossible to control the spray."
1,dismal,"I was ready to deal with ugliness of this product for the convenience and health benefits it promised. Unfortunately, ugly is as ugly does when it comes to the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W. The power does not provide sufficient force for a proper cleaning. The reservoir barely lasts the promised 30 seconds, which woefully inadequate for a full-mouth cleaning. I can't comment on the battery issues described in other reviews because I'm not waiting that long... the other shortcomings have sealed the (un)deal. Look elsewhere."
1,Not Happy,"this is the second waterpik waterflosser rechargeable I have purchased. I was going on an extended vacation and didn't want to take my big waterpik. The first one I had only worked a few months and by the time I realized it had a longer warranty we had tried to replace the battery because it wouldn't retain a charge. Anyway I figured it was a one time problem, but this new one I purchased stopped holding a charge within two months, I was on my vacation and unable to use it. I would not reccommend purchasing one, stick with the original plug in. I will be contacting waterpik about the product"
2,"effective flossing device, the on-switch needs improvement","Already bought three in one year. This product is very effective in flossing, unfortunately, the on-switch quits in a few months."
2,PRODUCT FAILURE,"Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360WI ORDERED THIS PRODUCT 09/17 AND RECEIVED IT 9/28/12. I STARTED TO USE THE FLOSSER THE NEXT DAY. NOW, HOWEVER THE FLOSSER WILL NOT RECHARGE OR HOLD A CHARGE AS OF NOV 01, 2012. ALSO IT DOES NOT HOLD ENOUGH FLUID TO COMPLETELY FLOSS MY TEETH. I HAVE USED WATERPIK PRODUCTS FOR MANY YEARS AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. AFTER READING SEVERAL REVIEWS I SEE NO POINT IN TRYING ANOTHER UNIT OF THE SAME PRODUCT. WHY THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD?"
3,Why I waited,"Because of some battery problems mentioned by others, I have waited to post this review. I have now had the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W for almost a year. Despite taking care with the battery by letting it run down as far as possible and then fully re-charging, the battery does seem weaker than upon arrival. The jet stream is not quite as strong, and it needs to be kept plugged in most of the time.But if your main objective is improved oral health -- and this was my objective -- it's done a great job. Made a noticeable difference when it comes to dental cleanings -- noticeable to me and noticeable to the dentist.So, well worth the effort."
4,Needed for travel,"After reading all the reviews of this item, I decided to order it and see for myself just how I liked it. I have owned other Waterpik devices and have always been satisfied with their longevity and durability.I wanted this model for travel and its size and shape is conducive for just that.Some of the other reviews indicated water getting into the charger input. I found it very easy to hold me finger over the charger input to prevent water infiltration while filling the device. When held upright, the charger input is shielded by the enclosure surrounding the input.Yes, you may have to fill the flosser twice while using, but a larger reservoir would mean a larger unit that would defeat its portability functions.It quickly removes food particles that flossing misses and if you need to irrigateyour teeth while on the move, I recommend this product."
2,battery sucks people!,very limited use out of this flosser before you can basically remove the cordless part out the title. battery life is horrible and cant wait till for another version.
1,"Two Waterpics in 2 years, battiers only good for a year!",This is my second purchase of the 360 Waterpic in two years. The first lasted 12 months before the battery gave out. (Note- The batteries can not be replaced.) I called the customer service department at Waterpic with no satisfaction. I bought a second one last year and with the same results. After 11 months it to gave out because of the battery. I would think with all the complaints the manufacture has received about the short life span of this 360W Waterpic they would have done something. It seems they just don't care! I just purchased a different waterpic made by ToiletTree it has a 4 star rating by comsumers. Hopefully this will last more than 11 months.
2,Rechargeable Dental Water Jet a bust!,"Very, very noisy, and adding water to it in the standard bathroom sink is very difficult. A kitchen sink would work better, but who takes care of their dentition in the kitchen? The battery doesn't last very long at all and you've got to recharge it every few days. It doesn't hold much water at all, and I only bought it because of the limited space on my bathroom vanity. For someone who is sold on using oral irrigation, it would make a good addition to your shave kit if you travel a lot. After about a month it just quit working altogether. I guess you shouldn't expect much for $21."
1,HATED this product!,"This product was not at all what I was expecting. First of all, it is so powerful that you practically have to use it in the shower to keep from drenching your entire bathroom. Water GUSHES out of your mouth! One of the attachments is supposed to be more ""gentle."" Not so! My poor gums hate me. Whatever you do, don't use this product to clean out your tonsils (those who still have tonsils may know what I mean): it kind of works, but they bleed so badly it's not worth it.My mother has an older model WaterPik that is gentle and wonderful, so I know a good product is out there. Buy a different product than this one!"
1,Poorly designed and very disappointed in Waterpik,"I wish I had read these reviews prior to purchasing. As others have mentioned, in order to adequately clean your mouth, the reservoir must be filled up repeatedly (at least 4 times), the angle the unit has to be held is awkward and not well thought out, the unit has very little power (I've not even used the ""gentle"" tip) even when fully charged. I can see where this would be helpful when traveling, for every day home use, it falls short. Thankfully, the unit was inexpensive, but it will be going into my closet until the next time I travel and I'll go back to the reliable (and powerful) countertop model."
1,Poorly designed... go with Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet instead.,"In addition to the other complaints about this product, on my unit, the rubber o-ring failed after only a few uses. Additionally, the charging port is protected by a rubber stopper to keep water out, which does not work all that well. I upgraded to the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet which is an outstanding product. If you have the vanity space in your bathroom, and an electrical outlet nearby, then I highly recommend the slightly more expensive model."
3,Good for travel; poor for everyday,"The design accomplishes two things:1. It takes up less space and weight in a suitcase than other designs.2. It is a poor choice for everyday use because there is no way to air-dry or to clean out the reservoir between uses. That, inevitably, makes it a nice breeding place for molds and other scuzzy things."
1,waterpik,It works BUT great Idea for handheld but does not hold enough water. You run out of water to fast and have to refill handle. Plus you dribble down all over handle and have to wash it every time. So my next one will be with the hose and a large tank for water. Don't waste your money.
1,"Concept Good, Durability Awful....",I purchased this unit from my denitst... Actually purchased three...They do not hold up to long term use... After 6 weeks I am looking for something similar but designed for durability....
1,Dies too quickly,"I am about to throw out the third WP-360 that I have purchased. The first lasted a few months and I loved it. It cleaned between my teeth and took little space on the countertop. But then it died. So I gave in after a few months without and bought a second Waterpik cordless. It died after a much shorter period, a few weeks I believe. I gave up on irrigating between my teeth.But I really needed a dental irrigator; dental floss does not do the trick for me. I had gone months and months without and I could see how my teeth and gums were suffering. So I gave in, and bought another one. I thought this time would be different...........And this third one died much quicker. I found it hard to believe. I don't know who I am more frustrated with....myself for buying another one or WATERPIK for selling an inferior product. I just assumed that they would improve their product. And I believe they will, which is why I write this review.WATERPIK--please improve your product. Thank you."
4,This is what I was looking for.. small and out of sight,"This is what I was looking for... a water pik that is small and out of sight and doesn't clutter up my dressing area. Convenient, hand held, cordless dental water jet for healthy gums. I bought one for my husband and I and one for my Mom. It is so easy even she can use it. I am still tinkering with the adjustments so I don't shoot myself in the eye or give myself and the mirror a shower, but so far I like it."
1,Runs out of water,I'll make this short and sweet...its reservoir doesn't hold enough water to do the job. It holds enough for about 10 seconds worth of use. I found myself refilling it about 2-3 times per use. Returned it to the store a week later.
1,Don't even think about it!,"This has to be the most poorly designed consumer device ever. You can't fill it at a sink with normal faucets because it is too tall. The tank is too small for a thorough job with only one fill. The pik rotates out of alignment on its own with only gentle pressure. The pik release is too close to the on/off buttons and you end up releasing the pik by accident and water is everywhere. It is cumbersome and needs to be used two handed, one to hold it and the other to steer the pik. The old plug-in styles work much better."
1,doesn't last!,"This item does not even deserve the one star I had to give it! I bought this product from a store in town, nice while it lasted. I thought it sounded like a weak motor from the start...I was right, it only lasted slightly more than two months! Ridiculous!...just glad it quit soon enough to return to Linens and Things. So much for a name brand...Shame on WaterPik!"
1,Good for short term or travel only,"Seeing that their are only two companies making small waterpiksthat can be easily transported in a carryon, this company has anear monopoly on this garbage product. You will get at best 1-3years until you have to buy a new one. Waterpik is smart enoughin their construction to rip off the consumer. They make it so youcan't replace the battery, and they do not make a small Waterpikthat is electric. If they did guess what... planned obsolescencewould not help their gross margins like this complete tool doesbased on the highest profit margin possible for throwaway consumeritems."
1,Best Chinese Engineering has to offer,"Lasted about a year, then just died. So on it's way to the land fill to poison mother earth, gift from the Chinese. Shame on you Waterpik for making the ultimate anti-green device. Guaranteed to fail, no replacement parts, poor engineering, testiment to Chinese greed. Will I buy another one, no. Tried of cheap junk that only lasts a short while. The reviews on here are true, these fail like wet or old fireworks. Good luck if you get a bang."
1,Defective DO NOT BUY!,If you buy this you will be sorry and Amazon won't help you when it the battery stops charging. Amazon should be ashamed that they keep selling a product that is known to be this defective. Mine stopped holding a charge after 90 days
1,Same bad experience,"My experience with this unit is identical to one of the earlier reviewers. The unit was fine for some time, than water somehow damaged the battery although I made sure to keep it dry and clean and the socket for the charger tightly sealed. After going through two of these units in less than six months it would really be dumb to trust this product for the third time."
1,Same dead battery problem as so many others,"I charged it up overnight and my first charge lasted two weeks! Awesome, I thought! Then I found out that was also my last charge. The darned thing would not hold a charge no matter ho many hours or days I leave it on the charger. It's junk now.:("
1,Failed again!,This is the second time I have bought this product. Works fine for two months and then kaput.Try another brand. I like the Panasonic even thought it has batteries. It does keep working unlike this item.
1,I sent it back.,I disliked it so much I sent it back. It was worthless. It was awkward to use and the reservoir didn't hold enough water for one useage. You have to refill it in the middle of cleaning your teeth. Spend more money and get a better product.
1,Water Pik,"I made the mistake of buying this WaterPik flosser twice. The first time, it lasted about 6 months and then died. The second time, it lasted about 7 months. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Buy a better quality unit."
1,Look elsewhere for a water flosser,"I was honestly quite disappointed with this product. At the price, I figured I'd give it a try, but I have been extremely disappointed with it.The battery doesn't hold a charge very long, as other have stated. But that's not my biggest complaint. I have to refill the water tank at least 3 times each time I ""floss""."
4,good product to scrub teeth,"a good way of cleaning teeth and avoid dentist visit for high cost deep cleaning, the product is good so far."
1,two times use.,"I used twice for get away trip, and after four months i tried to use it and i did not work at all. bad quality for a good name."
3,happy teeth!,I thought I could regulate the strength of water jet. We have very little counter space that is why I bought this compact one. IT is useful.
2,what else is there?,"This is the third one of these that I've gotten. In each case, the chamber that holds the watersoftened and eventually sprung a leak. The only thing in it's favor is that it's better than the otherbrand i got, which lasted for even less time. It would be nice if one were made with replaceable parts."
2,not powerful enough and sloppy to use,the pulse is too weak and its sloppy to use as it drips volumes of water. tank could be larger as well
1,design flaw?,"the 1st one lasted less than 1 month; the tip kept flying across the bathroom even after repeatedly making sure it was seated with a ""click"". the Company replaced it with ""no questions asked"" The replacement just died after about 10 months- not bad according to some of the other reviews. The pump output is greatly diminished when the tip is inserted. I tried cleaning the system with peroxide, then vinegar and replaced the tip- to no avail. Landfill. Perhaps there was a bad manufacturing run, but am not going to try again."
1,Does not last,Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360WThis product does not last. The first one lasted 9 months and then would not charge. I made the mistake of buying another and this one lasted 3 months. I would not recommend.
1,It stopped working after about 2 months.,I did not like the design as water would spill out unless you hold it upright. It totally stopped working within 2 months. A total was of money. I love the home model but it is not very convenient for travel.
3,performance,This is a good gadget. I am using it for a year and it works quite well.I did have to alter the switch to make it work as momentery instead of a toggle.With a momentary function I have better control because it stops as soon as thethe switch is released saving the water in the tank and avoiding making a mass around.{this may be a good advice for the manufacturer}
1,They Should be Ashamed,"I have had two of these WP-360W models and both lost their ability to hold a charge. The first lasted about a year, certainly no longer, and the last one quit in less than a year. Have always run them completely down to avoid nicad memory imprinting. Battery technology is much more advanced that what Waterpic chose to use and they should be ashamed of themselves. This problem alone makes the unit a rip off, at best! I just can't understand why WaterPik would offer such a sorry excuse for a product. Forgive me for rating it so high but they insisted on at least one star. They do clean just fine but do need a larger reservoir. They are in fact a lot cleaner to have around than their big corded brothers, and they travel as well as one would expect. I must be completely stupid so I am ordering the newer more expensive Cordless Ultra with even less water capacity and hoping for the best."
1,"Good idea, bad plan...","While this is a good idea, a hand-held version of the popular water-pik, this implementation could have used more work. On the unit I purchased, the nozzle-tip will not stay in the unit. This is likely because there is only one small catch to hold the nozzle-tip. The 'classic' water-pik hand-unit has four catches. Without the additional holders the nozzle may pop-off into the mouth and create a choking hazard. Another design issue is the small reservoir - I doubt I could finish my entire set of teeth without multiple fill-ups. Guess I should just break down and buy a replacement 'classic' water-pik."
1,Do not waste your money,"This is a great idea--as a dental professional, I fully support oral irrigation. And like other reviewers, I have had two. The first lost its oomph and would not charge after a few months. I did contact WaterPik by e-mail and they did send me a replacement. Great customer service, but it proved to be the same."
1,Cordless Water Pik,Ineffective. Not worth the money. Does not hold enough water and the pressure out of the nozzle is too low to do the job.
2,wish I could have loved it!,"I was very disappointed with this item. By the time it completely failed, after about four months, I could no longer return it. Basically, it would not hold a charge. The charge became weaker and weaker until it finally refused to charge at all. Also, I expected it to provide a more powerful stream, which it did not. On the upside, though, it was very convenient as an ""all-in-one"" hand-held device."
1,Battery fried after 1 month!!,"I wish I'd have believed the reviews I read here.....I was warned, but bought it anyway. Although I liked the product, esp. the convenience since I travel for business, the battery actually melted the plastic casing and fried the whole thing within a month. After numerous unanswered emails to WaterPik, they've now offered to send me their wp-60W counter top unit within 20 days of the return of the cordless unit. I'm going to do that, however I really don't want this larger model. It's interesting they didn't offer to replace it in kind, clearly they have no faith in the hand-held model. That's probably a good reason NOT to purchase one."
5,My gums are healthier with Waterpick,"I have had a Waterpick Waterflosser for half year now and am very happy with it. I have gum problems and decided to give it a try - the price is really affordable. Since then I have been twice to my periodontist for regular treatments and he finds my gums very healthy. The same with the hygienist, last time she told me: ""Whatever you do, keep doing it."" I haven't had any issues with the battery, as some reviewers complain. By the way, bought one for my wife too, and she likes it a lot. I definitely recommend Waterpick, especially if you have gum problems; it works as it says."
3,A little disappointed.,This Waterpik has good power but they don't last long if you use it every day. The batteries don't hold up to repeated charging like others I'm use to. Not made for replacement either. This is the third and I'm moving on to another brand.
2,"Bulky, low pressure and reservoir too small.","I have had a Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, which was great, until it started leaking everywhere after a year's use. Then, I got a new flosser through Amazon from ToiletTree Products, which only lasted two weeks before it stopped working. Now, I have the Waterpik Cordless model, and am underwhelmed. The pressure is too low, so it doesnt do the job it's supposed to, the reservoir is too small, so I have to fill it twice for one clean (and I dont dilly daddle around). The model is also bulky and difficult to hold properly. I wish I could take this one back!"
2,Not worth the money...,I had high hopes for this item but it turned out to be too much of a hassle.Pros:-Cordless-Compact-Comes with extra tip-Affordable-Easily gives those front and side teeth a good cleaningCons:-Hard to fill-Battery 'memory' is none existent after only 2 months of single person use.-Unit doesn't appear to be waterproof (duh!) connections corrode and become unusable-Messy - can't turn it to much to the side or water comes out so it can be difficult to get those back areas.-Difficult to get the back teeth with the same effectiveness as the front teeth-Needs to be filled more than once for a good thorough cleaningMy advice would be to spend the extra money and get the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet. It isn't cordless or portable but it gets the job done well without all of the inconveniences of this product.
3,waterpic 360,"Pressure spray is higher than advertised, the high pressure nozzle actually hurt. I put a hot glue plug in the high pressure and then drilled a 3/64"" hole thru it to lower the pressure, now OK."
2,Good at first but....,"I loved this Waterpik at first because I'm limited on counter space and it seemed the perfect solution. However, after about 8 months of using it I wish I would've bought the plug-in version. Just like many other reviewers I find that the thing will not hold a charge for very long. You might not think it's a big deal to recharge it but a full charge delivers the full amount of pressure and the correct jet pressure delivers the results you're after. My dentist just told me that my gums don't look as good as they did 3 months ago because my Waterpik is ineffective unless fully charged. Sooooo.... I will be researching a better quality unit and would caution anyone who's thinking of purchasing this."
1,rechargeable or disposable?,"Huge disappointment. I had the Panasonic EWDA10W Oral Irrigator but had trouble finding a replacement tip locally, so I just bought this Waterpik. Waterpik 1)does not have the same power, 2)goes only a few uses between lengthy charges, and 3)in less than a year, doesn't even charge anymore. (So off the hazardous-waste-recycling-center it goes.) Luckily, I kept the quality Panasonic and I just ordered the replacement tip from Amazon. I would advise you to NOT waste your money on the Waterpik WP-360W."
1,Awkward to use,"This item was recommended by our dentist so we purchased it.That was a mistake. We are very disappointed as past waterpik devices have been great.It does the job But :It is extremely bulky to useIt is difficult to keep from getting water all over you.Requires you to stand up straight over a sink to use it which makes placing in your mouth and letting water out of mouth extremely difficult.We used to use an old style water pick which had a hose connected to a Water holder - that one worked very well.Even our dentist, after seeing the device agreed that it is not well designed."
2,Not Extremely Happy!,"I bought this under recommendation of my dental hygenist - should have saved my money or should have gone for the more expensive model! This model doesn't hold enough water to do a complete job - barely enough water to do half! Spending twice as much time on rinsing (this doesn't clean, just rinses - you still need to brush)isn't what I want to do before going to bed - I already spend enough time brushing, flossing and poking between my teeth - I don't want to spend another five minutes just rinsing, refilling, rinsing, refilling, rinsing and then cleaning up afterwards (it's a messy procedure) for this step in the process. Sorry, but I think Waterpik could have done better."
3,waterpic waterflosser,"The reservoir is too small before it empties - 20 seconds? It works well when it's turned on, it's just too short to thouroughly clean teeth. If it would stay on streamning water for 40 seconds it would be much, much better."
2,I had to throw it away after about a year,"From the beginning I realized the reservoir was too small, but what was most frustrating was constantly charging it and then ultimately it did not hold the charge,causing me to THROW IT AWAY."
2,"Seems to work, but not for long","I bought this product as an extra weapon in my arsenal against periodontal disease.It definately seemed to improve my gum health (based on bleeding reduction) but like others have found it stopped charging up after about a month of use.I properly conditioned the battery per the instructions, and it worked OK for about 5 charges, but on the 6th it did not turn on at all.It also took an average of 2-3 fills per use, but this was not a big deal for me.I'd avoid this and go for a plugged in version, which is what I replaced it with. Aside from the battery issue, its much easier to use the plugged in one as the handle is less bulky, and the mechnism to turn the nozzle to keep it aligned with your gums is better."
1,It has too little power,It has less speed of water and dosn't do the job. It also only hold small amount of water. You need to refill several times to finish whole mouth.
1,Poor product,"I had an electric (plug-in) that died after a couple of years of use. I tried this unit and it not only operated at a fraction of the strength of the plug-in unit, the battery did not hold up for very long. The lower power means the product does not clean plaque or get between the teeth."
1,Water everywhere except where you need it...,"This was my first waterpik. The first one I picked up was clearly used. I ended up taking that back to the store and got a new one...but I also wondered...why was this brought back? Hmmm?For the second go-round, the irrigator's tip kept on moving during usage and never stayed still, causing water to splash everywhere..at one point, my entire shirt got soaked and I felt like I had taken a bath.I tried using it for a few days, and had the same difficulties.The reservoir constantly requires refilling.I gave up and ended up going back and getting a Waterpik Ultra. I had better luck with the stationary, home model.Not sure if there's a good portable out there as of this writing...*shrug*"
1,I have a dead one of these,"I never used mine in the shower or mistreated it, but it died anyway, after just a few weeks of use, and now sits in a cupboard because it looks brand new and I couldn't decide what to do with it. For a portable unit, it is also far too big, and as someone with relatively small hands, I found it very awkward to hold onto. By contrast, the battery-operated PanasonicPanasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigatoris everything this is not--compact, easy to hold, and functional. I have 2 of those that have been working for years. This Waterpik is clunky, poorly designed, badly engineered, too big, and, as others have noted, does not work. We need the option to provide no stars, or minus stars, for products with completely negative characteristics. If someone has the address of a Waterpik office I can send this disaster to, I'd be grateful. Shame on them."
3,not so good,The product is very useful but after having it for less than a year it will not hold a charge. Hate to have to break down and buy another but the flosser really helps with my daily oral hygiene routine.
1,Don't buy Waterpik Recharageable,"Battery lasts just 1 year, no matter how you charged it. I went through 3 complete units, and have just changed to the Oral unit."
3,water pic flosser,does not have water pressure for very long. stops working before all water used up I would nt recomend this model
1,Bad Purchase,I unfortunately bought this somewhere else but it is worthless!! Wish I had read the reviews first..like everyone else it didn't keep a charge and now won't recharge. About 4 months for me..do not waste your money!
4,Good Device with a good price.,"I can't live without this thing. Usually you can find it somewhere else but more expensive. This deal is very good and it works well. I need it to survive , I had a terrible gums problems and I need use it frecuently. This a new replacement for my old one, same model. The old one last more than 3 years, no problems at all."
3,A Rip-off,"It would be okay -- it actually works, though clumsily -- but it wears out. One of the tips quit working almost immediately and I had to reorder refills (they only come two to a pack). A week after spending $10 on refills, the whole unit quit working. Like everyone else's complaint, I'm fairly sure it's the battery. It's kind of a rip-off when it just quits working after you've only owned it for a few months."
2,Not Recommended,Bulky and cumbersome. The tank is does not hold enough water. You have to hold it upright in order for it to work which makes it very hard to rinse the inside of your lower teeth.
1,Junk,"This is a piece of junk. Holds only a small amount of water, must be held upright, has no cleaning power, and is highly inefficient. Should be pulled from the market pending a better, more useful design.Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS"
1,"Died after 3 weeks - poorly designed, poor quality.","I liked this product while it lasted, and I could really feel the difference in the health of my gums.It's bulky and unwieldy, but I got used to it. Didn't hold enough water to do my whole mouth, so had to refill several times - annoying.But then it just stopped pumping. The battery is still good, it just makes this slow grinding churning sound and no water comes out.Unfortunately didn't keep my receipt.I plan on getting the counter model instead, keeping my receipt, and filling out the warranty card."
1,Poor design,"When I opened the box the first thing I saw was a note that essentially said ""call us before you return this item to the retailer."" I thought to myself, this can't be good. Correct. Dittos to all who said the reservoir is too small, the requirement that you have to keep it vertical is quite awkward, and it's just plain messy.I guess they've made a train load of them and have to push them out the door.Update: After 4 months it has totally died. The motor can't turn but a few seconds, even after a full charge. The design allows water to get into the interior, which likely corroded the motor."
3,Love/Hate,"This is the fourth or fifth unit I've had of this waterpik. I love it because it puts out a great stream of water, and is easy and convenient to use. And its small enough to put in my bath vanity drawer, out of my picky wife's line of vision. What I hate: I've never had one that lasted more than 2 years. One of them crapped out at less than a year. The last one lasted the longest, so maybe they are getting better. No matter....I'll keep buying this product as long as I have real teeth....which dailey use of this thing will help with."
2,Not a quality product,"Everything that has already been written is true:--battery runs out of juice too quickly--noticeable decrement in performance very soon after ""full charging""--has to be refilled many times during a single use--have to be wary of angle or mechanism doesn't function properly/will spill(chamber doesn't stay closed)--isn't waterproof(ironic, seeing how it will be used in the bathroom, if not the shower)The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is really cheap(the cheapest I could find), but I will be spending my money on something better for my next one."
4,Works Well,"This is the third Waterflosser I have owned over the past 3 years. These last about a year - has good water pressure and overall very durable. After owning my first Waterpik, I could not imagine not having this as part of my everyday dental hygiene routine."
3,Waterpick,I bought this waterpick for my daughter to use. It really helps get everything out of her orthodontic appliances. She doesn't like how strong the stream can be--even when we use the least heavy pick.
1,A product to avoid,I purchased this product about 6 months ago. It did a decent job at first. Then it had to be recharged more and more often--now it won't hold a recharge for one operation. I just tossed it in the trash.
