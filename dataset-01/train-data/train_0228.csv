1,horrible band,"bland, boring music. they are now cashing in selling their junk to tv commercials cause they know the end is near."
2,Just annoying,"i don't understand how this album is getting such good reviews. This is one of the few albums that i had to sell becuase i thought it was just horrible. The piano is just like bang bang, playing the chords and bascially nothing more. The lyrics are all right, but the singing makes me wonder if they're sincere. Too many times ""open up your eyes"". This is just bad. The fact that the artist is Coldplay does not necessarily mean it's a good album."
2,so disappointed,well i loved parachutes and i picked this album up and completely was disappointed by it. I hate clocks. the only strong track on here is the scientist. all you people need to hop off the band wagon not everything the critics like is gold
2,Sounds Like a Budweiser Commercial,"This CD is boring. Not bad, just boring. It has all the musical adventurism of a beer commercial. A well-produced beer commercial, granted, But still, a CD that sounds like an hour of test-tunes for Budweiser's next Superbowl spot hardly merits the raves that have been showered on its head.I wanted to give ""Rush of Blood"" a chance, even though I'd found ""Parachutes"" uninspiring. So I brought it home, put it into shuffle-rotation with Radiohead and the Libertines, and let it spin.Folks, I cringed whenever Coldplay came up. I was reminded of nothing so much as the bloated pop epitomized by U2 and Sting.Download a song or two if you need a fix. But save your real money for music that you'll care about in two years. Beer commercials don't age well."
1,not like the first,"I was a little disappointed with this CD. I guess I loved the one before this one so much that I put them on some pedistool. Things on this CD seemed repeatitive and it lacked some warmth that the one before had. I could listen to the other one ""Parachute"" again & again. But this 2nd one I'll probably hand to someone I don't like or toss it out the window. Don't waste your hard earned money!"
2,Overhyped,"This is not the masterpiece it is made out to be. Just like Parachutes,it is helplessly forgetable. DO your self a favor and pick up the flaming lips's new alblum instead."
1,Worst music in the world,"This cd is BAD. From the Horrible intro song ""Politik"" to the over played ""Clocks"" to the boring ""Amsterdam"" this album is absolutly auful. It is slow and predictable. Music you fall asleep to. And the singing is soooooooooo bad, you know the people on American Idle, the people who get kicked out in the first round? They sing better than Coldplay's lead singer does. Another thing, you can barley hear the guitars! They might have not even put in guitars and you would never know. This cd makes me want to puke."
2,Singer ain't that good,"I was given this album as a gift three years ago and while it was new to me I immediately noticed that the lead vocalist had no idea of how to break away from singing very ""clunkily"" in syllables...to every song!!!I haven't read all the reviews to this album (would take days) but wonder if he annoys anyone else as much as he annoys me?"
5,The Brit Boys Have Done It Again,"Once again, these four men have proven to me that they can make the most appealing melodies go with an achingly haunting and beautiful voice. In my opinion, Chris Martin has the best male voice out there. And he proves it with their sophomore album. I've listened to ROBTTH almost every day since the day it was released. It just keeps getting better and better. Hopefully, one day they will be able to break free from the Travis and Radiohead comparisons because they are a band that deserves their own acclaim. My personal faves are God Put a Smile on Your Face and Warning Sign."
4,Another refreshing cd,"I like 'refreshing' as an adjective for Coldplay's music. The new cd, like 'Parachutes,' offers something a little different in today's pop/rock menu... This really is great song writing -- understated, melodic music, insightful lyrics, a very mature vibe in the vein of Radiohead, Dave Matthews Band, and U2, but with its own unique flair. You recognize Coldplay when you hear them. That alone makes them distinct in the popular music scene.As for the cd, it's a bit deeper than 'Parachutes.' It's got the same quiet feel, but there seems to be more happening in the songs, more depth to the arrangements, more instruments, including a lot of piano. It's more upbeat, too. The drummer has more to do on this disc than the previous, which is nice. The songs are subtle and very catchy, and fans of their debut will definitely not be disappointed. Overall a superb offering by a band that has earned its stardom by bucking the sludge trend and striking out on its own course. Pick it up!"
3,A Rush Of Blood To The Head,"I like this CD, but after a while all of the songs on it sound the same. Coldplay is a great band and I recomend this CD for anyone who likes that kind of music."
3,One of the most derivative albums I've ever heard,"So take a big chunk of Pink Floyd from the ""Wish You Were Here"" era, add in a good amount of Oasis, stir in some Collective Soul, sprinkle with XTC, the Beatles and even Simon and Garfunkle, mix together, and you end up with A Rush of Blood to the Head. When I first heard the title track I thought it must be from a Pink Floyd work I'd missed. This is a perfectly pleasant album to listen to but there is very little originality to be found here."
3,The beautiful moments can't save it.,"No matter how beautiful the song ""Amsterdam"" and a few select others are, they simply would not exist without Radiohead. People try to defend Coldplay and say they only sound like Radiohead because of the vocals... seriously, just listen to the two bands and respect both... no matter how great some parts of this Coldplay album are, it takes too much from Radiohead. This is my opinion, from someone hearing and loving Coldplay before I knew Radiohead existed: Radiohead just does their sound better than Coldplay. Of course, how can you perfect a sound someone else created? It kind of dissapoints me that Coldplay's gotten so much fame from Radiohead.""Let's see 'em try 'Kid A'"" -Thom Yorke"
4,A very pleasant surprise,"Comparisons to Radiohead are obvious, but not necessarily accurate. True, they seem to take some of the stylings. Yet the lead singer does not wield his voice as an instrument rather than a rendering of words. The lyrics do not spew angst and metaphors.Yet despite this, this is a very good album. Memorable melodies abound. Lots of emotional involvement. Lots of variety. Never a dull moment. There are several very good songs on here, certainly in line with some of my favorite albums. There seems to be a recurring theme of loneliness and regret relating to a lost love, and hope for renewal of that love. Their strength for me is in the writing of music and emotional involvement of the lead singer.Highly recommended.If they can make some truly meaningful lyrics for their next album, there is no question where they can go."
3,Nice but...,"Although Coldplays new album gets its sound and melodies from the same ingredients than the predecessor ""Parachutes"" it gets nowhere as high as the debut did. This album ain't that bad though, it is quite catchy and moody in fact. It just isn't as good as ""Parachutes"". Maybe their third album gets even near..."
5,Excellent and original!,"After falling in love with Coldplay with ""Parachutes"", I was very excited to hear ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". They have some really original songs in here, that have a totally different feel than ""Parachutes"". Politik and Daylight are good examples. It's nice to hear a band that doesn't always sound the same. Sure they still have really sweet and touching songs, like The Scientist, but they reached new musical heights with this album. I definitely recommend it!"
5,Rush To Buy New Coldplay,"""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" is one of the most brilliant records I've heard in many years, at least since the last Coldplay release ""Parachutes"". The current CD is a bit more lush in production than the previous and generates more of an emotional response to the music, with simple yet honest lyrics. ""Rush"" is also more upbeat than the previous release too, while the band indulges in several shades of style, from pop rock, to folk rock, to ballady piano, to pyschedelic/mid eastern and you get the feeling that this band is ready to take over the world without compromising their integrity for honest and powerful music.Absolutely fantastic vocals by Chris Martin with subtle yet powerful and clever muscianship from the other members, this new album is an awesome sophomore comeback from a band which I hope sticks around for a long time.Buy it."
2,Not so good,"This is the first colplay album I've listened to and probably the last. The album starts of OK then drops until the end where it picks up slightly. The songs all chug along using the same keyboard progressions and slow pace throughout. There is very little variation and while the production is good, overall musicianship is poor.Coldplay might be pleasant enough for those nights when you simply want to nod off. Indeed there are some nice melodies at times but overall this is a very pedestrian and uninspired effort."
4,In all truth a 4.7,"There is only one thing lacking in this follow-up to the incredible ""Parachutes,"" and that is an indulgence on part of the band into the more gentle side of their expressions, which leaves a small unbalance towards an understated side. Then again, Coldplay are masters of gentle statement and the sublime messages of music. But all other factors that made their debut like sunshine on a lovesick soul - consummate music craft, patience and temperance in their playing, a determined and steadfast character to lyrics and arrangement - are still present here. EAGERLY looking forward to album #3."
5,I can listen to it over and over again,"I've had this CD now for months, and I'm still not tired of it. ""Clocks"" is my favorite, but I love the entire CD--it's not one of those CDs with two singles and a lot of other garbage. The music practically goes right through you. I could go on and on, but just buy it (even if Justin Timberlake likes it, too)."
4,Amazing but somehow familar,"Don't get me wrong, buy this album if you already haven't, it's better than most of what is out today in music, but when I first heard these guys back a few years ago when they first came out, I just couldn't get over the similarity they had to Jeff Buckley, which is something nobody mentions anymore because Coldplay has become so popular. I was almost angry that even though the lead singer admits that he (Jeff) was one of his biggest influences, they are still considered an ""original"" band. Although throughout time I have really grown to appriciate thier music and almost forget that they did rip off Jeff Buckley a fair bit, and now that Jeff has nothing more to offer us as he died an early death it's nice to hear something similar to him. But buy Jeff's album ""Grace"" if you like these guys. It's not easy listening, but worth every penny."
5,beautiful melodies...,"The first four songs are amazing, especially ""Politik."" Coldplay reminds me a little of Radiohead's mellower moments, and R.E.M.'s softer accoustic albums, and also Manic Street Preachers. I'd hesitate to call them Eternal Masters, but this CD does contain some beautiful moods and melodies, very little filler. Evocative and lingering sounds..."
2,Damaged,"The CD itself was in good condition, but the case was creaked and broken. Seller should have put a warning or atleast a new case."
1,I'd rather be KICKED in the head than to have to listen to this CD or Crapplay in general.,"Annoying, annoying, annoying. Coldplay tries to make sophisticated music but it doesn't work! The lyrics, vocals and music are enough to put you to sleep, which I guess, if that is your sole purpose, to sleep, I would give this a 5 star rating. LAME GROUP AND CD. Oh, and Parachutes isn't any better. Do yourself a favor, save your money & buy something from an artist with TALENT."
2,Blah,"Boring, overrated, and pretentious - and that's just the first song. Coldplay have completely lost the intangible charm that was present on their first album in this misguided, misshapen shot at the big time. A swing and a very big miss from these soon-to-be one-hit wonders."
2,no rush here,"The hype was what it was, overkill in promoting a sophmore CD of a group who can do much better then what was produced here. I was disappointed to say the least, and although it's hard to top the efforts of ""Parachutes"", this doesn't come close. Coldplay needs to turn a deaf ear to the suits who obviously made them ""rush"" this out for profit. Buy ""musicforthemorningafter"" from Pete Yorn, that'll give you your ear candy for awhile."
2,dreadfully overrated.,"This is a pretty good album.mabee worth 3 stars at best.It is solidly written and well produced.But!It is very boring.You will get the same out of this album every time you hear it.There is not much else there ,than what is on the surface.Your normal ,mediochre friends will tell you ""go buy this album!""They will try to tell what I'm sure you've heard on mtv a thousand times.But think for yourself and examine it emotionlessly.You will find that ;beyond the sad ,forlorn love ;which is something that we all know and have experienced and could express quite purely.There is nothing to this music but1:accessibility(to appeal to anyone with pain) ,2: resources(with lots of money you can't afford to NOT sound good)3:and a bunch of booring british saps(who listened to the beatles once or twice)Listen,Learn,Make up your own mind!"
4,Great buy!,"Great buy, CD had no problems. Packaging was good; case was good and received it in a timely manner."
5,Coldplay rocks your soul with this beautiful sophmore album,"It is hard to put this music into words, but I'll do the best I can. Beautiful, hypnotizing, emotional. This album is just as, if not more, amazing as the first. Go out and buy this cd, let it never leave your player."
2,NOT SO GREAT...,"THis album was my least favorite so far. I'm worried now. I'm not sure what it is, but somethings just not right here. I got this album and THE HIPPOS new album and i was very surprised when I concluded the THE HIPPOS' album is FAR better then this one. I would have never expected that, but THE HIPPOS have a lot of great pop/rock intelligence on their new album. My recommendation is that you buy this album, cuz it's still coldplay and it's alright, THEN go online and get THE HIPPOS' new (and final) album, cuz it's AMAZING!"
1,Coldplay? More like OVERPLAYED!,"Overrated too. These guys are lame. I've heard maybe 5 songs by ""Coldplay"" and they were all slow, dry, boring, withery, flakey, coagulated, bitter, lifeless and forgettable. Well, not totally forgettable, cuz everytime they come out with a new single, it just reminds me of the last one. They're an extention of eachother.It's amazing what becomes the talk of the town these days..."
1,"Nice tunes, pity about the lyrics","I bought this CD based on the song, 'Clocks', which is playing a lot on the radio. Unfortunately, the CD is boring. The rhythms are neat and pleasant to hear, but the words that go along with them are confusing and rarely make sense. It feels like a lot of navel gazing going on here."
2,Vastly Overrated,"This CD is remarkably similar to Parachutes in that the singles are the only good songs on it. The second star is for ""Clocks"" and ""The Scientist"". It's puzzling and disappointing that a band that can deliver awesome material can also churn out unlistenable drivel."
2,Wake me when it's over......,"Talk about a bunch of Radiohead wannabees!! This music will put you to sleep faster than a Johnny Carson re-run on t.v., trust me!! Coldplay are a tuneful band, I'll give them credit for that, but the guy singing sounds like Dave Matthews - with the boys from Radiohead backing him up instrumentally!! There's nothing wrong with trying to put some intelligence into your music, but these guys have a holier-than-thou vibe that rubs many the wrong way, including me!Well, Da Peace Dogg just don't recommend this one...I'll check ya' later!!!!!!Da Peace Dogg - '02"
5,The Top Rock CD of 2002,"As a very big fan of Coldplay, most likely I'm expected to say that yes, this cd, is the thing to hit us in a long time. And guess what? It is! It is a fantastic cd, that everyone must take a listen to. It is very different from its older brother, that of course is, ""Parachutes."" From its sweet and delicate ballads to its rock track. This cd offer great music! An excellent cd, that makes me listen to it more and more. Great lyrics, great, simple music!"
4,"Okay, but not excellent","I like this album very much. The only thing that makes me give it a 4 is many of the songs soung exactly the same. The best thing i can think of on this album is the track called ""Clocks."" It is one of the best songs i have heard in a while. Worth your money, but probably easier to just download ""Clocks."""
4,well,"Definitely not as good as parachutes. not nearly as good. some songls, like clocks nd the scientist, are completely awesome, but others like the title track are below par for coldplay. every song on parachutes was perfect. I like that on rush of blood they're experimenting with radiohead-esque styles, branching out, but sometimes they go too far. chris martin's voice is beautiful and musical and works better on more lyrical songs... oh i will marry that man someday. anyway. this cd is definitely getting some spin time in my player, but a revisitation to older styles my make me very happy with their next record. sigh."
4,"A great album, but please stop the Radiohead comparisons.","Coldplay is a talented band of Brits, and I like them for what they are. This sophomore album, in my opinion, is much better than the first. None of the songs on this album can top ""Trouble"" on Parachutes, but there are stand-outs. The adrenaline-inducing ""Politik,"" the simplistic yet catchy ""In my Place,"" ""The Scientist,"" ""Clocks,"" and ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" are all memorable examples of songwriting.People have compared Coldplay to Radiohead, or at least a former incarnation of Radiohead. I think this is a misguided view. The former leans toward the more contemporary, dare I say the often-used ""wuss rock"" term; the latter has pushed the very boundaries of alternative rock. There is no comparison, folks...Coldplay is NOT what Radiohead used to be. These are two very different animals.So just sit back and enjoy what both groups have to offer in their own, unique way."
4,chronologically goodand bad,"well,firstly im a fan of radiohead(in the bends,radiohead era at least) and coldplay are one of them bands that have a slightly similar style..this album is chronoloically good and bad withthe first 5 songs(politik,in my place,god put a smile upon your face,the scientist,clocks)an excellent collection of piano and guitar driven songs in tandem with chris martins vocals..however,and this is only my opinion,the album falters somewhat with the last songs relying excessively on martins vocals with little instrumental assistance..regardless this gets 4 stars because like most albums every song isnt perfect(ie..the bends;blackstar,sulk) and similar to radiohead they will havea job living up to the success of this..still its a good album worth buying"
3,Hmmm...,"I bought this album after it won a Grammy for record of the year for ""Clocks,"" a song that I loved. I was hoping that the Cd would measure up as well, as I had heard ""The Scientist"" and liked that too, but I was a little disappointed. I thought a few of the songs were dull and mediocre, but maybe because this isn't my favorite style of music?Overall, its an alright CD... I wish I had borrowed it from a friend before I bought it though, not sure I would have bought it."
4,Sonic signatures,The often reviled mega-seller's sophomore release upped the volume and proved to bitter critics and music snobs alike how intuitive touch and expansive production elevates simplistic songwriting to earnest levels.
3,It's nice to be nice to the nice...,"I prefer letting the hype die down before digging in to artsts like Coldplay. Finally picked this album up a solid two years after its release. It's a good listen. I like it. I give it 3-1/2 stars.But there is so much hysteria in the reviews here on Amazon, so much hyperbole. Yes, these guys make a nice blend of emo and prog rock, but there's lots of good music out there. Enjoy it for what it is, a pretty darn good CD...but nothing more."
4,THE SCIENTIST RULES,"THE SCIENTIST is the 4th track on this CD. I heard it one time on the radio and new I had to buy the CD. That one song is that good and my whole reason for owning the CD. That being said, I also found POLITIK surprisingly good on the first go around. Of course everyone is familiar with CLOCKS by now because it's all over the radio, but THE SCIENTIST is the stand-out song in my opinion. It's the kind of sad, haunting music that gives you a heavy heart and makes you think of every special girl you ever broke up with. The rest of the tracks didn't really do it for me."
2,Does Anyone Else Hate this?,"My friend who usually has good taste, recommeded this CD to me, and I really had no idea what it was going to be like except mellow. I like some mellow, U2 is okay. I put in this CD and I was so BORED. Sorry. Every song sounded the same and didn't stir any emotion in me. I gave the cd to a co-worker, big mistake because apparently she loves it and plays it over and over again, which adds to my hatred of this wretched cd.. Go buy American Life,,, much better.. or some Johnny Cash..."
3,good... not great.,"in my place, god put a smile on your face, and clocks are strong songs ... but the rest fall a bit short.""parachutes"" remains a masterpiece.while ""a rush of blood"" is merely a competent album."
5,Simply Wonderful!,"This cd is truly one of a kind. I remember hearing it on AOL back in August a week before it came out and I loved it then but didn't get around to buying it until yesterday, and frankly I had forgotten how wonderful this album really is and I wished I had decided to buy it a lot sooner. It has some great rockers and some sweet slow songs as well, and Chris Martin's voice is just achingly beautiful. I love music just about more than anything and I am very picky about what I listen to, and I can honestly say that this is one of the very best albums I've bought this year. Just wonderful and very highly recommended. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
3,RECORDING TOO RUSHED,"It may be unfair to judge anything to its predecessor but this new Coldplay CD sounds too rushed, lacking refinement in the recording and editing department. Yes, it carries Martin's vocal signature but the emotions ( or lack of it)present in Parachutes is collectively shallow. Only ""In My Place"" and one other song will experience popular airplay.Parachutes had melodic guitars but this CD somehow lacks this melodic spice..."
3,Polished,"I finally purchaed this CD. The playing is really good and elegent. Starts off strong. ""The Scientist' & "" Clocks"" are especially good. Quality drops off towards the end off CD and gets boring. Just may be too tasteful and antiseptic for own good."
5,mind blowing,"When i went to Britain earlier this year, i was asked if i knew who Coldplay were. And i told them i didn't, and then cast the band off as some sad pommy music trying to get famous.I got back, and when i turned on the radio, i heard this music.the lyrics, beat, instruments, the entire music is so beautiful, calming but at the same time so fun to listen to. i dont know exactly how to describe their style, but i know why they're such a hit, and especially why no one in this forum area has reveiwed it any less than 4 stars."
5,A great Album.,This is all I hoped the album would be and more! Ever since parachutes came out I wanted to know what the follow up would sound like. It's by far the best album this year. If you like Travis or Radiohead this is the album for you.
4,Soothes The Unsettled,"The song CLOCKS was played in a group home where the participants are generally unsettled and unruly. To the amazement of the employees, they settled down and listened to the music peacefully. One of the participants even starting singing ""you are you are beautiful""...Music like this doesn't come along everyday."
5,BEST LOVE AND ROCK ALBUM EVER,Great album! Every song has a deep and meaningful lyrics.The band is comparable to beatles songwriting ability.Politik - beautiful musical arrangemnets. Piano and guitar blended together to form a beautiful songIn my Place - great guitar and vocal performance. Soulful lyricsGod Put A smile upon your face - country-like song with a nice guitar accompanimentThe Scientist- It is the greatest song that you must checked out on this album. Great lyrics and music. Best song ever recorded.
4,Rather good,"This CD one of the better albums released recently. The two songs you might hear on the radio are ""Clocks"" and ""In My Place"", and these are both rather good songs, with plenty of depth and nice sound. Some other notable tracks are ""The Scientist"" and ""A Rush of Blood to the Head."" The track: ""Daylight"" is the CD's lowpoint, but other than that most of the tracks are nice. Worth buying, but nothing epic here."
4,about the last review,"i loved the album, i thought amost every second of it was beautiful. i also wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars but since the half option isnt availale i gave it a 4. after reading the last review by Drew Magary, i realized that Coldplay does have potential to give their songs more depth and variety. but i disagree with the notion that they should follow in the paths of Radiohead. The band [radiohead], to me, almost totally reivented themselves. So many people say ""Gee, I love their earlier stuff but they lost me on their more recent writtings."" I not saying tha Radiohead's latest material is bad, but they didnt seem to add to their writting, instead they seemed to change it. Coldplay should try to add a little more edge to some of ther songs, but they souldnt attempt to change anything. Their mterial is already captivating. ""The Scientist"" is a bonafied tear-jerker."
2,Not for me,"OK, everybody gives this five stars, and people say ""everyone should own this cd."" I can tell there's talent afoot here, but I don't care for this particular flava. I like Radiohead, but not all post-rock emo and I like Dylan and Nick Drake, but certainly not all post-indigenous folk. I like Sparklehorse, but not My Morning Jacket. Say what ya like (or what you don't like) no single band or cd is for everybody."
3,Coldplay's idea of ambition,"A Rush Of Blood To The Head is an agreeable addition to the alternative rock sphere. It is a reliable, occasionally eloquent collection of mostly guitar-driven ballads which has found a considerable audience since its release eight years ago. I must admit, there are far worse albums (and bands) out there, but it is a bit too conservative to my ears. Oh well."
2,Eh...,"They really aren't that good. I've heard some tunes on the radio, downloaded some others... I'm just not impressed. I caught their performance on a rerun of Conan, it was awful. I don't get the hype and I don't understand the accolades, they're not that good. I'm reminded quite a bit of Oasis and Radiohead when I listen to these songs. And I must say, Radiohead and Oasis do it just a little better than Coldplay. It sounds to me as if they took a turn for the ""let's gain the critical praise other bands like Radiohead and Oasis get,"" which in their respective cases, both sophomore albums did gain better critical response than the debuts. This album, in no way measures up to Parachutes, which I didn't like too much more than A Rush Of Blood To The Head. However, it's definitely not the worst thing I've ever heard, but I've heard a lot better and more entertaining music this year, or any year for that matter. This is what I would listen to if I had no other choices."
2,""" Dunno !""","Yeah, I think I would have to agree with the other reviewer! You should give ""Splinter"" by the ""Sneaker Pimps"" a listen if you like this. They have the same empathetic sound but they do it with more finesse, creativity and dignity than this band. This band does lack alot of chord progression and craftmanship !"
3,not bad.,"another album from radiohead-lite. by that i mean it sounds like radiohead in their early years (circa 94), but a bit lighter. album sticks together more than coldplay's first.a top 20 album from last year"
4,Almost perfect,"This CD is one of my all time favorite's! I wouldn't say it breaks new ground, but it certainly digs a little deeper into its genre. Chris Martin is an fantastic frontman for Coldplay and his vocals are amazing! The entire CD is filled with excellent songs, but here are a few highlights:""Polotik"". My second favorite song on the CD.It starts out loud with banging drums, but halfway through, it switches to a soft, two minute instumental with heartmoving piano playing by Martin.""The Scientist"". My favorite of the CD.A haunting ballad of love, loss and forgiveness.The piano is extraordinary!Overall, the CD is never boring and I can listen to it all the way through without skipping any tracks.At times its quiet and refelctive, or loud and incredible.Chris Martin, Will Champion, John Buckland and Guy Berryman are truely geniuses of our time.I cannot wait to get their new CD and I am definetly going to atten their concert in September."
5,Staying Power!!,"After listening to this for most of the past three years, I can safely say that this is music that will last. Much like Steely Dan's music, which I have enjoyed for the past 30 years, I can see these songs aging that well. Each and every song has a musical or vocal hook that just pulls you in. In this day and age when a hummable melody is all but nonexistent in popular music, the lads in Coldplay have arrived to show us the way. Keats famously said that ""a thing of beauty is a joy forever."" He might as well have been talking about this album."
3,Question for Coldplay fans,"I like this band well enough, but I really love a song that I keep hearing, but cannot figure out the name of! The lyrics in the chorus are something to the effect of ""I'll be by your side/Just try and stop me."" If someone can help me out, please post the name of the song. Thanks!"
4,A good sophmore push,This album has a little less creative meat than the debut album but still holds its own as a great listen. I miss some of the drum breaks building chords off Parachutes. There is just a different feel overall. This will prove that Coldplay has staying power. Keep it up guys!
4,Locke lives in the gutter of Shame,"New Coldplay Grade Report:Politik: Interesting Singing Style, solid opening number: AIn My Place: Radio #1 Sounds faintly like Yellow: B+God Put a Smile Upon Your Face: Solid AThe Scientist: Piano Man on Stilts. Nice: AClocks: Moby-esque? naw Sting-esque. B+Daylight: Haunting Vocals. Nice Strings: A-Green Eyes: To much Reverb, Poor: B-Warning Sign: Tom Petty [take], Best Song Ever: A+A Whisper: Exactly what it says, Something lacking here: B-A Rush of Blood to the Head: Title Track, When it kicks in Beautiful: A-Amsterdam: Piano Man meets Conting Crows, just better singing: B+Overall, I remember Chris Martin (Coldplay's lead singer) saying that their bestsongs have yet to written after the success of Parachuttes. I still believethis. I'm interested to see what the next album will sound like. Good album, buttheir first album was remarkable. Something is missing on this Sophmore release.I would have never given a B- on Parachuttes.Do you agree?"
4,good stuff,I think that this is one of Coldplay's better albums along with their Parachutes album which I believe is their best album to date.
5,Don't Be Fooled by the Bad Reviews,"Why do so many people hate Coldplay? Just because some people are comparing this wonderful band to others they think are better doesn't make Coldplay bad! Every song on AROBTTH is magical in its own unique way. If you still think that Coldplay sucks, blame it upon a rush of blood to the head."
5,one of 2002's greats!,"'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is a bonafide great album. It deserves to be included among the best of the year, in the same breath as Bruce Springsteen's 'The Rising,' and the jaw dropping Doves release 'The Last Broadcast.'Their Grammy award winning debut 'Parachutes' delivered a lot of anticipation for a sophomore release. It too was a strong, gorgeous set. Coldplay's new release easily meets and exceeds expectations. In a day when rock albums have become collections of tired riffs and recycled melodies ready for FM radio consumption, Coldplay has developed a melancholy, yet shimmering and warm set blending consistency and vitality.Attempting to address highlights on this album is simply lipservice. However, 'In My Place,' 'The Scientist,' and 'Warning Sign' are ideal check points throughout this album.Altogether, plaintive piano chords meld with pensive guitar licks and Chris Martin's heavenly falsetto. Curious? You should be! This is one of the 'must own' albums of 2002!"
5,Forget the Hype: They're Greater Than That,"Hype makes it almost impossible to judge bands because the publicity seeps into one's judgment and becomes the story rather than the actual music. So I took a break from Coldplay for a year and went back to them and I must say their music transcends all the hype. Amsterdam, God Put a Smile on My Face, and my favorite, The Scientist, head the album's charge though you won't find one bad track. Why is Coldplay so successful? Of course, the voice. Of course, the universal themes. Of course, the melodies. But I can't explain why people of all ages love them. It's rare that such a cool band has such mainstream appeal. Many already know that the wonderful band Keane is being, rightly, compared to Coldplay. But for two lesser known bands that have similar melodic""emotional rock"" qualities, check out the Swedish bands Ronderlin and Radio Dept."
3,Plain and simple.,"I could listen to Parachutes (chill out music) beginning to end but I havent even been able to do that with ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". I usually just get bored and change the CD after the first five songs. Its not an awful album, just not enough to hold my attention for long."
2,(Yawn),"I tried to love this album. I wanted to be cool. I wanted to be able to sit through the entire thing and I wanted to love it so much that I had to listen to it over and over again. But, I'm NOT cool and I couldn't even sit through the entire thing once without taking a break. Why am I even writing this review? Who cares?"
5,The best ever,"oh my god! this cd absolutely knocked me off my feet.. whenever i pop any other cd into my player, it feels dry in comparison to this gorgeous album.. honestly, coldplay is practically all i can listen to now. this cd sounds much more confident than ""parachutes"", chris martin (lead singer) must have gained some of his confidence back. absolutely wonderful"
4,Highly addictive sound,"I have been a fan of Coldplay since Parachutes, and this new album has been in my cd player frequently since I bought the cd. I appreciate the way the songs move through different ranges of emotion, from the harsh thumping guitar in Politik to the almost fantasy-like scales of Clocks (which, incidentally, reminds me of something out of the movie ""Neverending Story""). The prose is not at all shabby, and as a whole it is a great cd to pop in on your drive home from work to de-stress and daydream to."
5,Even Better than Parachutes,"Coldplay's follow-up CD to ""Parachutes"", ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" is an even stronger album than the first and that is saying something. All of these songs grow on you, and the first time I listened to this CD, I knew I was listening to something great. However, you just don't hear songs like track #4, ""The Scientist"", every day. That song is incredible and worth the CD's price of admission alone. ""Politick"" and ""Clocks"" are other outstanding songs. If you like British bands like Radiohead, Travis, the Verve, etc,, then you owe it to yourself to pick this album up already. Even if you don't like those groups, you STILL need to pick this album up already. This CD will be referred to as a classic 20 years from now."
5,First exposure,"Was ""In My Place"", but the album is like a perfectly crafted novel. Keeps you one your toes from start to finish. Love ""Politik""."
2,Pleasant enough,"Fairly pleasant pop rock marred by the irritating omnipresence of its singles. It's definitely 'pretty' but because this stuff has been done many times before, in much better ways both musically and lyrically, it has next to no impact or staying power. It's profoundly unadventurous, but at least it's better than most of what is on the radio today. Then again, if you're listening to the radio these days, there's probably no hope for you. Check out Wilco's 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' or Clearlake's 'Cedars' instead. You're gonna be hearing the songs off this one on car commercials for the next 5 years anyway, so you really don't need to buy it.Oh heaven forbid, a negative review! Bring on the 'useless' votes I guess.."
5,Drivin' Music,"Found this CD by accident when I stepped into the Virgin Music store in Time Square. The CD was playing and it was one of those ""who IS that band?"" moments. I'm an old classic rock guy so I'm not up to speed on this alternative rock stuff but this is some great music. To me, it sounds like a cross between U2 and Dave Matthews with a touch of Beatles sprinkled in. Check out ""Clocks,"" the 5th cut on the CD. Makes me want to get in the car and find an open road..."
2,Review of Vinyl Pressing,"As my topic states, I write to discuss this album on vinyl, not the content of it, as I love this album.Unfortunately, the pressing leaves much to be desired. Perhaps it was not best treated by the girlfriend I received it from, but it does not have deep grooves and gets much popping and has a shallower sound because of it. The quality of the sound of this record is very much near the bottom of my new (not used purchases) vinyl."
5,The best album released in 2002,"I thought that it would be neccesary for everyone that is reading these reviews to know something very important. Rush was mentioned in one of the previouse reviews and they were compared to Coldplay. I laughed when I read this. Nothing on any cd by Coldplay can even be compared rush. The piano in Clocks is unique and out of Rush's league. The notes are very far off from the solo in countdown, the song mentioned. I am an experieced musician and can clearly see the night and day difference. This cd is out of this world with talent and are in a totally different league than everyone else. Radiohead and U2 are the only people that compare in equality. Coldplay shares nothing with Rush or any other electric guitar or drum driven band."
1,"wow, another one note riff","Oh please. This music is NOT complicated, and it does NOT take as much talent as it seems. If you think this is heartbreaking beautiful, listen to Blind Guardian's album 'Imaginations from the other side'. If you listen to some of the stuff from that album, you'll realize coldplay are dwarfed. If you do not and slam my review, you did not get any smarter.Sorry guys im just tired of all this ""intellectual"" level criticism these guys are getting, while truly talented musicians go unnoticed. But this is how it is - people don't go beyond mtv these days."
1,Couldn't even access,"I was very disappointed in my purchase because to this day, I have not been able to access my download of Coldplay, A Rush of Blood to the Head"
5,They've done it again!,"Totally agree with previous comments. Its a great album, great voice, great band, great songs. You cant NOT like it!Loved almost every song in this album."
5,Great!,"Wow! Where to start.If you've liked or thought older Coldplay songs such as ""Yellow"" or ""Trouble"" were good and you think that ""In My Place"" is really good just wait until you hear the whole new album. From the first song ""Politik"" you know you are in for something special. And then fourth song , ""The Scientist,"" First time I played it I cried. It's one of those rare, rare magical songs such as Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were"" Here, ""Under the Milky Way"" by the Church or ""Ocean Rain"" by Echo and the Bunnymen. ""The Scientist"" will win a Grammy, mark my words. I'm so glad these guys are here. I belive they'll conquer the world as U2 did in 80's, because they deserve it.Buy this CD for yourself and anyone you care about. (I bought 5 copies one for me and others for friends and family) AMAZING."
4,Nothing like their first albulm.,"If anyone out there, like I was, expecting another albulm like their first and is going to be deeply disappointed, then again you may love it. This made it hard for me to review. I Loved to chill out to Yellow, Parachutes,Shiver Sparks etc etc. I am listening to it again as I type the review.So there are no songs like Yellow. No real deep chilout songs with killer melodies and that fantastic voice. This is Coldplay doing Radiohead, or dare I saw REM. It is good. But not as good as Parachutes."
1,garbage,"utter garbage. don't waste your time. go buy the new supergrass or Zwan. or better yet, buy a classic Smashing pumpkins album. now."
1,!!!PLEASE NOTE!!!,"Please read this, this is important.If you think that this album is better than Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' rate this review as not-helpful. If you think it doesn't worth any s**t to make it compared to 'Dark Side' rate this review as helpful.Thank You"
2,Quite possibly the most overated band of current times.,"Unimaginative songs, delivered with repetitive and monotonous, completely dull vocals. I just do not understand the hype nor the interest unless ofcourse, it is more about the lead singers relationship with his famous, and equally dull, wife and his tendancy to name children while visiting the greengrocers.Every generation gets saddled with a dull band most people don't appreciate and who end having no real talent and longevity much beyond their media hype, witness Oasis. Not worth listening to and I guarantee you will tire of it and find it irritating eventually."
2,"listen to some real music, for god's sake","coldplay makes bad music. music should be EMOTIONAL. music should make you feel things. also, music should have SOME sort of display of technical ability. these guys' producers are better than they are. anyone can be good if they have good producers and a lot of money.coldplay's music is melodramatic and whiny. their music is devoid of any emotion, because it has been sucked out by excessive production and WAY too many layered tracks upon layered tracks.furthermore, they are very similar to radiohead, too much to ignore... which is a shame, because radiohead is such a great band. the difference is, radiohead can a) actually play their instruments well, and b) actually write really good songs, instead of trying to make up for their lack of songwriting with production and cheesy string sections.the only reason that coldplay deserves two stars is that at least they're not nu-metal."
2,shameless rip-off.,"All Coldplay is a rip-off of Radiohead and Wilco. They're very good at ripping off Radiohead, the first time I heard of a few of their songs, I thought it was Radiohead. They're not very good at ripping off Wilco yet, though.That being said, a great band like Modest Mouse started off as just a rip-off of the Pixies and Pink Floyd. Once Coldplay learns to create their own sound using their influences like Modest Mouse did, I bet they'll be one of the best bands around. But for now do yourself a favor and go buy Radiohead's Amnesiac, Pablo Honey, or the Bends; or Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or Summer Teeth, instead. Your money will be much better spent.The biggest plus though is ""Yellow"" isn't on this Cd. Which was quite possibly the most annoying song ever."
4,Shatters the Myth of the Curse of the Second Album...,"I have to admit, I was at first apprehensive to hear the second cd, because of the fate that takes on many acts that make it big with their first cd; they usually fall short of empty filler with a radio hit (if theyre lucky).This collection of songs here are just as good as the first album, if not sweeter.The lead singer's voice still manages to soothe and carry me away, even if he does sound like a cross between Dave Matthews and Thom Yorke (radiohead).In My Place, in my humble opinion, is a better single than either trouble or yellow. SCIENTIST is also a great peice, and happens to be the personal fav of the band.Any way you look at it, if you pick up this album you will not be disappointed. It works for listening to when your alone in your car, and its great for laying in bed with a special someone, as the backdrop of a special night."
5,Brits are Back...,"This is a cracking album. A must for any lovers of Radiohead, U2 or Stereophonics. The British boys did it again, and just as good as their first. Check out their website."
5,Brilliant!!,"I was NOT a big fan of Parachutes. But I have to revisit it now.""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" is THE best album of 2002 so far. It will be hard to top.I know some people hear some U2ness in Coldplay, but I never really have (U2 is my favorite band). What I do hear is a cross between the best of Radiohead, Moody Blues and Pink Floyd.The songs just envelope and lift you away. It is so easy to be swallowed up by them. It just sounds like an instant classic. It feels like I've always known these songs -- that's how quickly it grabs you.I really don't have too much to add to what's already been said more eloquently by other reviewers."
1,"If I could give a zero, I would",I don't know why anyone likes this type of music. It's very depressing. I can't wait for the fad to end!!!!
1,A Flush of Turd in the Head,"Funny people compare Coldplay to Radiohead or U2. I honestly thought I was hearing Dave Mathews on the radio. If your into a band that sounds like some other band thats already done it way better, Coldplay is for you. I imagine Joshua Tree is older than most of this band's listeners anyways so it doesnt friggin matter."
1,Worst Cd,I bought this cd thinking I was going to like it. Who wants to hear music that sounds like alternative music played on a piano. This group is one of the worst I have ever heard. Also take note that this group is not played on the radio. It sounds like his piano is out of tune.
2,Pretty noninventive stuff,"I can't believe all the love coming these guys' way. Someone said I don't have to like them if I don't want to. Well, I was all set *to* like them, but...I don't get it! Same old Bono-type voice and a watered-down Radiohead pop is what I get. Slick, but no sell. ""Can't make it withoutchoo, I missyouooo..."" Come on! What the hell has 60 years of rock and roll brought us to, this? They're a fine band, but the fact that people are so ga-ga, as if they're doing something great! It's just plain old undifferentiated blandness. Give me Art Zoyd, gimme Swans...! Hell, give me Jack Logan."
3,Can be a bit BORING...,"It's almost been a year since Ive bought this CD and I must admit that I havent listened to the whole album!That's because some of the songs bore me to death..I repect Coldplay and some of their songs are nice,mostly their singles.With regard to this album,the only good songs are Politik,In My Place,The Scientist and Clocks..Other than these songs,I cant bear to listen to the rest of the songs on the album."
2,repetitive and boring,"You can either listen to one song eleven times or all eleven songs, but either way you're hearing the album - it's just the same (five minute) thing over and over. Buy one off of iTunes or downloaded it, but don't waste money or time with the whole CD. (I might be missing something here, because I can't actually sit still long enough to listen to any one of the songs straight through.)"
3,Geting better there Ernie!,"This is Ernie singing ballads with Bert and the other guys from Sesame Street again. I don't know but I can't help it. It does sound like Ernie singing. Close your eyes and imagine.. Maybe Guy Smiley? Help me here. Ernie has always been my favorite. But still good ballads, nice mix and production suited for guys who can't play technically. I like it. I can listen to 4-5 songs on it and then maybe 4-5 songs again next year. For Parachutes I said 2-3 songs. Now it's 4-5 songs. Getting better."
2,"Try as I may, I can't bring myself to love this...","I loved ""Parachutes"" for the very same reasons I don't love this album: reminiscing of love lost, or about to be.It was delicate, soothing, appeasable yet appealing; on the other hand, ""A Rush..."" is simply boring.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
2,Uninspired background music,"I have to agree that this is a disappointing CD. It's not even that it's bad, just unoriginal & derivative- there's not a note or idea on this album that hasn't been done better by someone else. This is the first one I've ever heard by Coldplay, so I can't compare it to their previous discs, but I bought it mostly because I'd heard Clocks and liked the sound. Typically the singles tend to be my least favorites on a disc; usually the singles are the most accessible and ""catchy"" sonds on a disc, while the meatier stuff doesn't get the airplay. For me this disc was like going to a comedy only to find out that every funny moment was in the trailer, and the rest is just filler.This isn't a terrible album by any means- quite the contrary, I guess given the sad state of music nowadays, this is probably actually above average. If you get a good deal on it, it may be worth buying for the two or three really good songs. Otherwise, pass on this one.I give it two stars."
2,A rush of boredom to the head,"So...350 (!) people have told us their opinion of this album, and we get an average rating of 4.5 stars. Don't believe it.Coldplay can be compared with Oasis and other pop bands from England. I bought this album cos I was curious to see if it was that good everyone said (even Joey Tempest from Europe - remember ""The final countdown""? - was praising this album). I have to say that Coldplay gets a bit boring, but on the other hand boredom seem to be what many English pop acts build their music around.I certainly don't get a rush of blood to the head from listening to this album. There's only two good songs: ""The scientist"" and ""Green eyes"", and one decent: ""In my place"". The rest makes me wanna shout to these guys to stop. I don't listen to music to get depressed, do you? [...] I might think this one is perfectly suited for you.Me? [...]"
2,"Please, let her get a real job . . .","As if Venezuela didn't have enough problems right now, along comes this. Irregardless of Ms. Machado's extremly checkered past, I suppose one should judge this album on its strengths and weaknesses alone. Derivative music, poorly written songs, and very weak vocals equal a musical abortion in my book. Perhaps it is time for Ms. Machado to get out of the entertainment business and move into something else."
3,OK for her debut effort,"A couple of nice songs, nothing original or innovative, just plain old formula pop rock, but a million times better than Dayanara Torres (Miss Universe 1993) musical effort. Alicia's voice is weak, but it works with the songs. Best track: ""El País de las Maravillas"". Definitely, a good release for an ex beauty queen, hopefully she'll get better with time, she has the potential."
1,Shallow and doesn't cover Windows Scripting,"Incredibly basic...assumes you don't know to code at all. Needs six chapters to cover variables, functions, arrays, loops! One shallow chapter about the debugger. Security coverage--a bullet on the back cover--a joke. No mention of Windows Scripting Host. Maybe good for someone who wants to learn programming...and makes the weird choice to start out with VB Script. In sum, a bizarre book."
5,Wonderful Devotional,"I got this devotional because I wanted something substantial to really dig into. Although the daily readings are not as long as I would like, Stanley has done a wonderful job with this book. I have learned a lot doing my daily devotional and can't wait each night for a new one."
2,Microsoft Project 2000 from Course Technologies,"As a new user, this is the first book I found that really stressed then made learning the fundementals of the program easy. I refer to this book quite often and have found it an invaluable resource!!!"
2,The 85pc tool kit,A good chunk of items in this tool kit i had to throw away because it was worthless. There is a mini vac that really sucks (no punn intended) and it gives you a mini flashlight wich is also crappy (mine never worked in the first place). If those items were left out this kit would be amazing as everything else in it is great.
4,Fellow PC Toolkit (55 piece],"A nice computer toolkit. I use it every time I work on a computer or build a new one. The variety of tools is excellent and contains just about everything you would need to build or upgrade a pc or laptop. If you are looking for an inexpensive yet comprehensive selection of tools, this may be for you. I am happy with it. The only additional tool you might need is a larger philips screwdriver. The set included is fine, but a little to small when torque is needed for a stubborn screw."
5,JG from Massachusetts,This is a comprehensive tool kit for the do-it-your-selfer or the professional. Nice leather case. Great product
2,Mediocre Tool Kit,"I don't expect superior quality in these low-priced tool kits, but I was definitely disappointed in this product.The screwdriver is essentially useless. It is a clever design with a swivel head, but poorly designed. It is a challenge to keep the head straight and sturdy when used as an ordinary screwdriver. I can't imagine one would fare any better with the head set at a 90 degree angle.I broke down and bought a Klein multi-tip screwdriver as a replacement--that improved the utility of the kit immensely.The flashlight is useless. In this day and age, a cheapy incandesent flashlight is little more than a toy. A compact LED flashlight would have been a better choice.Overall, if you replace the screwdriver, the kit is serviceable. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,Spend your money on a better kit,"This product is very cheaply made/designed. The screwdriver won't lock into position so it's useless. The vacuum is not a vacuum at all - it just makes noise but doesn't do a thing. Flashlight? Don't bother. You would be better off going to a home repair store and buying a screwdriver set, a mini car vac and small maglite. The items that might be worth something are the things that are rarely used in normal pc repair. Don't waste your money on this kit!"
1,Poor quality - returned after the first attempted use.,See the attached photo ( when it appears ) to see the problem. A gap in the needle nose pliers that should not be when fully closed.
5,Turbulent souls,"Reading ""Mysteries"" is like being able to read music: our soul is touched, moved and transformed by the sounds coming from these pages. It is also a novel so far of complacency, very modern and surprisingly tough. I hope some present writers could take note."
5,"Mysteries, a Novel",I gave this as a gift to my mother who is very well read and also a critical reader. She said the book was fascinating and a great read. I look forward to reading it myself.
4,Never quite matched his first novel,"Undeniably a book of mystery. The reader always gets a dual sense of distance with Hamsun. There is the proximity - at times alarming - between the narrator and the synaptic impulses of the main character's brain. Yet there is also this persistent sense of not being let into a secret, the key to the disturbing, possibly insane nature of the hero (if you can call the prominent figure in Mysteries that). What Hamsun, and I'm guessing now, was trying to let the world in on was a kind of proto-existential angst - Kafka before Kafka if you like. The hero lives in a constant tornado of emotional highs and lows at times appearing in control, at times not. And this is the unsatisfying, fascinating heart of Mysteries. I urge you to read it, but only after reading Hunger, which set high standardsnot only for Hamsun but for modernist writers for decades to come."
4,Great batter bowls!,"These bowls are great! They are dishwasher & microwave safe and I love how they don't slip all over the counter when your mixing something thick. I always use them to make dough that needs to be chilled, because its so easy to just put the top on and pop it in the fridge. The only thing I don't like about them is that the measurements are hard to see."
4,Lovely,"This scent is tricky. I've heard it described as a green scent- but when I first sprayed it I immediately associated it with Givenchy's Ysatis, which strikes me as much more of a yellowy-amber scent. The initial spray is overpowering and chemically. Its quite awful really, all ginger and chemicals. Yuck. Wait a few minutes though and it calms down well with a very unusual and yet feminine ginger/floral scent. An hour later it smells lovely, feminine, and soft, more of a white scent than anything else. It doesnt last TOO long, maybe 5-6 hours but its a very nice casual scent and unlike anything I've ever smelled before. Recommended for anyone who'd like a unique and striking casual perfume and are willing to wait a few minutes for it to settle, then Cabotine is for you."
2,"Freud 8""X1/8"" Jointer Knives","These will not fit 8"" Jet Joiner/Planer as stated. Unfortunately, Amazon does not sell replacement blades for this unit that they sell. So - I cannot speak for the quality of these particular blades."
3,"Starts off stong, but ultimately inconsistant","I was truly enjoying this book as it began. I am always drawn more to character driven romances than those powered by a mystery or event. My problem with the book is that the plot changes mid-story. Robert is a tortured hero in the beginning, having debilitating panic attacks and unable to converse with his family. In a matter of a few weeks, though (the whole story took no more than a few weeks from start to finish) he's completely overcome these problems, fallen in love, and solved the mystery of who framed him. I'm afraid I just don't buy it. I wish Ms. Enoch had just focused on Robert and Lucinda's relationship and left the mystery for another story. It didn't meld well with this one. To add this element, she had to resolve Robert's problems much too quickly."
2,Wish I could feel the magic,"I keep trying to read Suzanne Enoch's books and I can't like them. She's not an incompetent writer, but... this author just doesn't work wonders for me. It's strange, because it's all there - the writing is good enough, and her historical details/research; it's her characters and the plots of her books that just don't hold my interest. I can't escape a ""been there/read that"" feeling when I'm reading her work. And I always have a hard time finishing her books! This is the third one I've tried and I have to say, I'm giving her a a pass from now on.I also have to say I find her heroines somewhat childish or maybe the word is naive. Or maybe it's the trouble they always seem to get themselves into. The heroes are always a little more interesting in her works, than the heroines."
3,not the best of the trilogy,this is the third but not the best of the trilogy. it's pretty boring compared to the other two.
3,Not bad....but not great.,"A well written book. However I have to agree with another reviewer and say I don't think Ms. Enoch is for me.I loved Robert and ever so loving his family. Perfect characters in every way.I found Lucinda to be very shallow. Looking for life to always be ""simple""....Couldn't stand the fact that Lucinda's other suitor was always in the middle of everything.If like me you are looking for a passionate love story filled with sensuality, this is NOT it."
3,Not so perfect,"This book was a fair read. It came to me highly recommended. No doubt, you'll love the Perfect Hero in the story. It was just lacking something. Half way through you know who's going to lose at the end. It was a dead giveaway. It took away some of the pleasure from reading the book. And yes, I am a picky reader. I prefer books that are not total no-brainers. I do give them all a chance."
2,"Sorry, not overly impressed","I'm not a huge fan. This book had it's good moments, but for some reason it just didn't flow."
5,i really loved it!!!,"i never really am one to write reviews, but after i read this one i was blown away. if you want to read a story that is not all balls and gowns, silly obstacles, and some real life problems this is the one. go read it today :)"
4,"sometimes confusing, but very good","I enjoyed this book very much, and I will be sharing the book with a couple of friends.There were times I became a little confused when timelines were jumped. There was a lot of history in the beginning which for me hurt the story a little, because everything in the beginning was shared with great detail so the ending felt rushed.It took me a while to get into the story, but once I did, I had trouble putting it down."
5,crickwing,"I found this book to be one of the best children books i've read. The storys about a cockroach that has a cricked wing and is always being picked on. He decides to pick on things smaller than him after a bit. The book has a twist in the end. It has good drawings, pictures, and cool colors. Its a cool book and worth reading. So read it!"
5,Cannon Does It Again!,"I am an elementary teacher, and Jannell Cannon has recently become one of my absolute favorite children's authors. Crickwing is yet another wonderfully told story with beatiful illustrations. Whoever thought that a story about a cockroach could capture a reader's attention like this?"
4,Juneau 2nd Grader,"Crickwing is a very artistic beetle. Everyone calls him that because his wing got twisted in a fight with a frog. If you get mad easily, Crickwing knows how you feel.When the army ants attack, Crickwing uses his artistic talent to scare them away. If you like bugs, this book is for you."

2,Mostly ignores First Division's history prior to WWII,"My great-grandfather was a combat veteran with the ""Big Red One"" in World War I. I bought this book, and several others, because I wanted to learn more about what he experienced as a solider in the ""Great War"". This book is devoted almost exclusively to the First Division's history from World War II onward. Even the ""clothing and equipment"" sections are of WWII vintage. There are only a few pages devoted to the First Division's formulation in 1917 and their major campaigns of WWI. What content does appear for WWI is a high-level summation of events. I hope that the other books that I purchased about the ""Big Red One"" provide a more complete history ""from day one"". My rating of this book is lower than usual due to to absence of detailed information about the First Division prior to WWII."
3,Good overview of the 1st Division during WWII,"This book discusses the 1st Infantry Division (The Big Red One) during its campaigns in North Africa, Italy, France and Germany. It looks at unit organization, equipment, weapons, uniforms and even some personalities in and associated with the 1st Infantry Division. The writing is OK but the book is lavishly illustrated with photographs and drawings. Most of the photographs are period but some are of WWII reenactors and are acknowledged as such. The book also discusses the role of the 1st ID in WWI, Vietnam, Desert Storm and the Balkans. A good pictorial reference mostly."
4,Not that bad!!!,"Traffic is a great movie, so I thought that I should get the soundtrack since I liked the movie so much. The soundtrack is really good, all the tracks are excellent. This album is for everyone, I think that everyone will just love it. If you liked the soundtrack of ""When the devil came"", then you will love this album..."
3,Traffic really rocks,"Before even seeing the film I purchased Traffic's soundrack and it really is a super collection of tunes that as a stand alone CD or as part of the soundtrack (I am sure). Definitely quite ambient, the feel is very much like Tangerine Dream with beautiful synth textures. Also a couple of fun tunes (ie. Fat Boy Slim) that always sound better when your sterio is turned up to 11. Enjoy - great for late night drives...."
3,A bit of a gyp...,"I picked this up because it sounded interesting, and because I'm a big fan of disaster novels. Imagine my surprise when, 2 pages in, I realize that I've read this before! In the mid 70s (I believe) Racina wrote 'The Great Los Angeles Blizzard'-'Deep Freeze' is a reprint with some revisions to update it and a silly Manson cult subplot tacked on. The book was ok the first time (I really love cheesy disaster novels), and ok this time, but I was a little ticked that the publisher made no mention anywhere that this was a reprint."
1,Absolutely Horrible Writing,"Even reviewing this bomb seems somewhat pointless! However, it was so bad that I just felt it my duty, as a avid reader, to warn people off from this atrocity. Deep Freeze held my attention (barely) for maybe twenty pages before I knew it was going to be a collosal groaner. The writing is...well...surprising for a multi-book published author. To call it plodding would be generous in the extreme. The characters are paper thin and BORING! The author seems to realize this and gives almost no effort to developing the absymal cast. Sometimes a great story can save bad characters but not in this case. Let's put it this way, if you are stuck on a desert island with the options of counting sand or reading this book...count the sand!One other thing...I noticed that Amazon's # 1 reviewer gave this book a 5 star rating. Hmmmmm?"
5,Children Just Like Me,"I purchased this book for my son Ben when he was 2 1/2 yrs. old. He is now 10 and my daughter Maria reads it continuously. This book is by far the best young children's awareness book about the differences and similarities between all children on this earth. I work for the YMCA and have purchased it for our summer camp so that the children coming to stay at Camp Silver Beach can learn more about the childhoods of the international counselors who are role models for them during the summer. At 2 1/2 years, my son knew the continents and could point out where ""Ari or Celena"" lived and tell me their favorite toys or food and point to the countries in which they live. This book is colorful and timeless expanding a child's view of the world and helping to instill the compassion we need to get along with all kinds of people."
5,A simply GORGEOUS book all about kids around the world!,"This is a truly marvelous piece of work featuring so many different children from so many different parts of The Blue Planet! Those young folks all present a very insightful slice of their lives in such an amazing diversity of cultures that will really open the eyes of a typical kid here in America and everywhere else. Then he and she will learn that not all kids come in a similar package and that ""the small world"" is not really at all small in its great variety of human beings and their ways of life. So let all those wonderful kids take you on an eye-feasting tour 'round the whole globe!"
4,un livre remarquable,voici l'exemple du sujet parfaitement traité. Son iconographie est ce qui se fait de mieux. C'est à l'instar du livre de Peter Menzel un livre référence qui parle du temps réel et se projette dans le futur. C'est un des meilleurs livres jamais publié. Il existe en France un autre titre consacré aux jeunes Franais. Mme présentation remarquable.
1,Worst Set of Wiper Blades I have ever owned!!!!,"My title says all, did review and was about 50-50 on performance, but took the chance, because in my mind anything is better than OEM. Was completely wrong on that thought, OEM was able to keep window clean on up and down movement. The Bosch wiper 422A blade leaves about 3 inch smear in viewing area (area as you are looking straight ahead) on down movement. Went to Bosch web page and ensured 422A was driver side, but flip position with 422B anyways and now only leaves about inch smear in lower part of viewing area. DO NOT Recommend these at all, if you do not trust OEM blades try something else, because Bosch 422A/B ICON Wiper Blades are a waste of your money."
1,"Overpriced, and defective","I purchased this item (Bosch ICON 422B) as well as the 422A for my 2004 Tahoe. The wiper does not reach all parts of the window, specifically on the bottom right of the passenger side. As for the Driver side, the blade streaks and again misses part of the windshield at the top of the arc. I contacted Bosch directly, and they said that they were aware of these defects, and there was nothing they could do about it. They said that they were not able to get enough tension in the blade to make it conform to my windshield. They said I would have to take it up with the retailer. Bosch still claims that these are compatible with my vehicle even though they are aware of these defects. You are much better off paying half as much, and giving up the ""extra 20%"" life Bosch claims and buy some traditional metal bracket wipers."
5,Best wipers yet....in my book,"The price is worth it and I live in Florida so the heat is strong. These r the best, most quiet, streak free, do not skip wipers I have ever owned. They r also built for faster speeds on the highway without problems. Big plus"
2,The average wiper blade,"With a $15 rebate, I bought a set of these (422A-422B), to see if they were any different than the $4 blades I usually buy. I won't buy these again. Sure, they look nice, and they work like new wipers, but I could have bought 4 sets of wipers for the cost of these, and had the same results. I wasn't impressed in the snow and ice. They still freeze up, and end up leaving large gaps in the clearing swipes. Maybe I just expect too much out of an ""high end"" wiper. It was worth a shot."
2,Streaks and more streaks.,As with the other side I bought this one streaks under normal conditions which is disappointing because the whole point of getting these is because it specifically says its made so it doesn't streak. the wipers before these all I had to do was spray the windshield washer and it would not streak anymore if they were dirty. that doesnt fix these.
3,Hydroplanes a lot,I'm not sure if it was just this specific wiper or not but it hydroplanes a lot even when driving at only 40 m/h. I know it has something to do with the wintery weather here in MN but my original wipers for my BMW seems to work much much better.
2,Worked great.. for a while,"I replaced my original factory wipers with these. They did an amazing job for about 6 months and then they started to streak. Not sure how long wipers are supposed to last, but 6 months seems kind of short. Especially when I live in southern California and it probably only rained 4 times in those six months."
4,House Churches in China,"Aikman's text is an excellent field ehtnography of Christianity in China, with a particular bias towards Chinese house churches and the growing evangelical movements in China. This text, however, does not give an unbiased view of Chinese Christianity (it tends at times to be somewhat disparaging of the Three Self Protestant Movement and Bishop Ding), nor does it answer the question about the global transformation of power (my guess is that this was an editorial choice of titles to maximize book sales). What Aikman DOES do, however, is provide a sweeping view of evangelical Christianity in China, giving us a birds' eye view of some of the challenges and problems of China's church today, while documenting major leaders of the autonomous house churches. I heartily reccomend this book for anyone desirous of learning more about evangelical Christianity in China today."
2,Dissappointing,"AIkman wrote a fair history of of Christianity in China, however he misrepresents what is going on in China today. By far the biggest problem in the Chinese church is poor teaching and abusive practices. This exists almost exclusively in the underground churches.Aikman wrote a book that caters to the palates of American Christian evangelicals who want to hear exactly what Aikman is telling them. Young ""missionaries"" who have yet to understand the difference between culture and faith or have even critical thinking will use this book to find inspiration and funding.As a Mandarin speaking Christian who has spent considerable time in China I was hoping to like this book. If I was not, I would proabably think it was very good."
4,God's Work in China Prospers,"Aikman turns a reporters eye to a careful analysis of the incredible move of God in Mainland China over the past 30 years. Three significant movements are identified and explored -- the Underground Church -- the Revival within the Three Self Church -- and the unusual influence of Christian scholars in Chinese culture. Captivating reading -- but apparently the naming of names and inclusion of pictures of famous Christians in China has led to some increased persecution.Aikman's assertion that some day the critical mass of Christianity will reach the tipping point and bring sweeping social change has proven to be an embarassment to the government, And if there is one thing the government of China won't stand for, it's being embarrassed. Read it with discretion."
5,The New Christendom,"Philip Jenkins has alerted Westerners to the fact that the centers of Christendom are moving from their traditional locations in Europe and North America. Christianity is growing exponentially in Africa, of course, but in China, too, the numbers of adherents continues to grow. Jesus In Beijing speculates that withing the next thirty years, a third of China's population may be Christians, making it one of the largest Christian nations in the world.David Aikman, former Time Magazine bureau chief in Beijing, has written a winsome account of the history and development of Christianity in a nation with which he is very familiar. His personal contacts with House Church leaders, past and present, and with leaders of the Three Self ""State"" Church, give the book a clarity not likely to be repeated. It will undoubtedly become a standard reference in years to come. Aikman's style is always well-paced, so the book is a delight both for the scholar and the novice."
5,A very good solution to a memory foam mattress problem,"I bought this based on the review about the memory foam mattress. About five years ago I purchased two high density 4"" mattress toppers to make a mattress (was cheaper that way) and put them in futon covers. The problem was that they were always sliding askew from each other. It took a lot of effort, but they fit into this protector. After I got them into the cover, I made the bed and the sheets stayed put like they haven't before.I don't plan on removing the cover, I see it as a permanent casing, but I have to option of machine washing it. Very highly recommended if you need to fix a memory foam issue and don't want to pay $250 for a commercial casing."
1,Not sized correctly,"I tried to put this on a 10"" mattress but it would not fit. It was supposed to fit a 14"".. The zipper broke trying to put it on. I did not try to return because of the company's return policy. Beware and read everything about return policy."
4,Good for the money,"I recently purcheased a Como Twin Cot for company we were expecting. It is a good value for the amount of money spent. I haven't slept on it myself just laid down on it to try. But our guest slept very comfortably, and when we asked, she replied it was very good. Not much assembly either, just mounting the wheels. And the weight of it is not bad either, I carried to the second floor of our home from our basement allmost entirely by myself. I like it!!"
3,adeq. not great,"adeq sleeper, althogh added mattress topper. 1 wheel broke replaced all the cheap wheels at home depot."
2,Key Does Fit,"I thought this said it fit the 2005 Acura MDX, but it doesn't fit mine. Perhaps I purchased the wrong one."
4,Very Safe,"This McGard Wheel Locks are the BEST, someone tried to steel my tire and he couldn't because when I got my new car, a friend of mine recommended to buy this McGard Wheel Lock."
5,Great for kids and family.,This video was a whole lot of fun and offered kids a look at the real world of being an airline pilot. Bob was a very interesting and fun character.
1,Mostly about a guy trying to be funny,"This ""kid's video"" is more of a self-serving stand-up act by this guy Bob. My child loves anything airport-related, but with very little footage of real airline stuff, this bored him to tears. And, since Bob's painfully un-funny, I can't bear to watch it with him. Waste of money!"
4,Insight to Irish genealogy,"In tracing the ""representative"" story of his mother's life, the author provides an insight into the motivation and experience of the Irish immigrant. There is also an interesting lesson on the difference between memory and history. Both of these items are of particular interest to the genealogist."
1,An uninteresting history of the writers mother,"The writing is adequate, but this story is not very interesting to anyone other than the writer, and his family.The character, the writer's mother, left Ireland at age 16, a 4th grade drop out, who matures, in her new-found home town of Chicago, goes to work at a variety of jobs, and eventually meets and marries her husband during the years of WWII. I was hoping that this would be a ""Michner"" like story, integrating the lives of the ""characters"" with real historical events taking place in a real time line. I did NOT enjoy this story, nor did I find it very interesting...a ""ho hum"" kind of tale!"
5,"Double Feature, Double Campy!","Wow! Those are some goofy looking monsters! I saw this flick on TV when I was a little kid, and when I saw it recently, I started to get scared but soon busted out laughing! The psuedo-science is especially fascinating, re the 'tissue samples' (?) 'I'm going to run some carbon 14 on this. There's been some amazing discoveries in the field of genetics.' Now, I'm no scientist, but I'm pretty sure that's BS. The other feature includes Del Tenny's 1962 period cliffhanger (?) 'Living Corpse'. It's Roy Scheider's debut. Other than that, it's not very notable. The DVD features an interview with Del Tenny, and I find that rather fascinating, just how this guy was able to navigate his way toward making these pictures and scoring some decent cult success. If you like off-the-wall horror, this is definitely a must have. It's the stuff that inspires all the parodies, and I'm sure the filmmakers had a lot of fun making them!"
3,Attack of the Schlock Monsters,"Okay, these are cheesy movies and that's the point, just for a couple of laughs. What is outstanding is the video quality. You won't find better ones that I am aware of. No, we're not talking stellar high definition merely decent clean copies. There are copies of the Horror of Party Beach being sold that are so poor, so muddy that it is impossible to see what's going on. Come to think of it, that could be a plus for many viewers. Have some friends over and torture them with these turkeys, it's what a good host does."
3,scared the pee out of me when i was 10,"i watched movie as a kid and was scared to death..LOL now after all these years i bought the dvd..thinking? how would i react to it now? well when those over grown daffy duck headed monsters came out i started laughing. it wasa beach blanket movie without frankie and annette..completed with pseudo beach songs.i didn't remember the black female character in the movie..but of course she had to be a maid,large in size and eyes wild open in fear looks.the only thng missing from her performance is eyes rolling. that is so dated..but she accidently discovers how to kill the monsters.and peace fell upon party beach once again."
5,Horror that get down..................,"Horror of Party Beach what a classic. This movie is ahead of its time. Toxic waste dumped into the ocean turn human skeletons into mutants. The kill scenes are pretty gory, and the women. They are more lose in this film. Unlike Universal Monsters films. Remember seeing this classic on tv years back. Great late night watch. Curse of the living corpse is also good."
2,Not better than Vines--not even close.,"I was very excited to get this book. It was the first expository dictionary I purchased for my Bible study. I found it odd that even though Mounce had a big part in the ESV this book is sort of hitched to the NIV.Now that I have Vine's dictionary and the SUPERB and FABULOUS, Complete Word Study Dictionaries I find myself never looking at Mounce's dictionary at all. I have been flabbergasted at the words he chooses to leave out in the expository section. And the explanations are not always that enlightening. I love the ESV! But this book was a huge disappointment."
3,Not As Expected,"Vine's, in my estimation , is the better choice. Although this tome touts itself to be more ""complete"" and based on more recent discoveries of everyday usage of the koine Greek, yet, it is not as comprehensive nor as well explanatory as Vine's. Subtle instances of the author's bias defining certain terms relating to doctrinal issues are apparent rather than giving an objective, forthright description. It is useful in a limited way but does leave something to be desired."
3,Not good enough,"I agree with the previous reviewers. There are several weaknesses in the layout and the dictionary itself. Example: on page 783, the author discusses the Greek word for weep (Klaio) and his explanation and examples totally ignores one of the most well known times when Jesus wept (John 11:35) which is the verb dakryo. This verb is listed on page 1115 - in the Greek! Not much good for those who haven't studied Greek before. There are several times this happens. The word 'contend' (e.g. used in Jude 3) and receives only one reference in Mounce (Diakrino); in Vine's it receives 3 references (athleo, diakrino & epagonizomai - the actual Greek word used in Jude!) My advice as a language teacher - Vine's should be your first stop - then Mounce's."
4,Good But...,"I do concur with the previous evaluation. This volume is good, but it is not necessarily a complete replacement of your old Vine's. The improvements on Vine's are laudable, but that is all. Keep your Vine's.In fact, there are still places where you will find a better discussion in Vine's.Mounce's, however, has a better OT treatment overall. I especially like the brief lexical treatment in the back.Purchase it, but don't discard your Vine's and allow to gather dust."
1,mounce's kindle edition,"This seems to be a very good book. And that's too bad because I can't get to any of the words I want to look up because the kindle edition does not have an index at all. If I need to look up a word starting with the letter w, I literally have to press the page button about 800 times to finally get to the word I am looking for. I'm sure the actual physical book is great, but the fact that the kindle edition has no index makes this book completely useless; how am I supposed to navigate it? There is no way to select the word I'm looking up with no index. I was excited to buy it, but but with the lack of an index I cannot use this book. It just doesn't make any sense. A complete waste of 15 dollars."
1,Horrible formatting,"Longer Greek words are unreadable. They become ""pinched"" and the ""text"" is just a rasterized graphic, which cannot be resized. The words can be in Unicode. This is simply unacceptable. I didn't even bother with the Hebrew. And the worst part? You won't know this until you actually buy this because the preview doesn't show it!"
5,"...a valentine gift, belated ...","I bought this book of mid-century erotica for a gal was getting to know... she already had it, and hated having to search through boring bits to find the bits she really liked. So, I bought her an extra copy she could cut down (with a knife) into the a ""just the hits"" version.The book arrived a bit after the desired Valentine weekend, but it was a well received first gift at the beginning of our courtship. ... through she ultimately stopped seeing me after a few (thrilling) weeks.As for the book. It's not bad, from what I've read.I've only perused those pages she excised and left around my bed."
3,"Not sure what I expected, but this is NOT fun for a 2 year old.","We bought this video because our 2 year old is OBSESSED with fire trucks and we own ""Lots and Lots of Trucks"" which he loves. This is more like a documentary on fire fighters and trucks and less a montage of fire trucks doing cool things, like the other videos. It might be good for older kids, but wouldn't recommend for a little one."
3,"So-so, videography seems old","This video has highs and lows. James Coffey songs are great, some of the video is newer looking and clear. But a large portion of it seems old and the video seems old and fuzzy, like it's from the 80s or early 90s. The James Coffey songs held my 2 yr old son's attention, but that's about it, and he loves firetrucks."
4,"I ordered from Tokyo,Japan","My son is very happy. My son is 3 years. He loves fire trucks or ambulances.He has to find yourself in a commercial for this DVD in Youtube.I was afraid that I can not play different region codes, but safely play on my DVD player. BANZAI!!Also be learning English. Is recommended."
2,Disappointing,"How disappointing to see the same old, same old represented here. While a few voices are fresh and interesting, the majority (whose poems have been encountered in too many publications lately) feel stale. This anthology contributes nothing new to the broad and exciting spectrum of today's poetry. See American Poetry: The Next Generation for a more democratic and surprising vision."
4,"Finish ok, but not oem","Blades not installed yet. Can't verify fit. Finish not up to oem, but should work ok. Price was right, though."
2,Not a successful collaboration,"Having been a fan of Robert Asprin for a number of years, and having been impressed with prior collaborations of Jody Lynn Nye, I found ""License Invoked"" a disappointment. Little about this book has the ring of truth necessary for a good fantasy. The characters have an unpleasant, one-dimensional feel to them: a perpetually annoyed, insecure, English government agent; an upper-class Englishwoman masquerading as an Irish 'acid-folk' singer; a French Quarter denizen on the government payroll. Combined with goverment agencies specialising in the paranormal (X-Files anyone), a Satanic version of tele-evangelism, and you are left with a mixture that doesn't jell. There is a certain disconnected air to the story, as if neither Asprin or Nye had any real interest in the tale."
2,Not his best,"I'll usually buy anything by Robert Asprin - his ""Cold Cash War"" makes my top ten sci-fi books ever. This book read like a poor attempt to create another Thieves World franchise. The characters aren't engaging, the events fairly ho-hum. Save your time. Read his Myth series instead."
2,Minus 1 star for a mixed beginning,"I'm glad to see Asprin back to writing on a regular schedule.These two authors 'invoke' a good story with personable chemistry between the protagonists. So why only two stars?The beginning, so important to hooking a reader, is a jumble of mixed messages, and doesn't do justice to the plot or characters assembled.Never confuse a reader as to whether you are going to ""romp"" or deliver careful characters. When the material starts out slyly poking fun with odd government agencies like ""O.O.P.S.I.E."", you expect you are going to read ""screwball comedy"", which is a place the authors have creative gifts.But this is actually a murder and black magic story -- a pretty good one.If you can roll past the first thirty pages of mixed signals, you might find a nice story here."
5,WoW!,"I have to admit that at first I didn't really like Fine China, better yet, I didn't give them a chance. Wow did I feel dumb when I actually saw them in concert at a festival I was at and realized how wonderful they really are. Afterward I talked to the band and realized what great people they also were (especially their keyboardist! :-D) Since then it has grown on me and I find myself driving down the highway with this CD blairing in my player. Its worth every penny, and I can't wait until they put out a new album!"
3,A good start!,"While it is great that Turkmen-English products in the 'new' Turkmen alphabet are available, some more attention could have been paid in the proofreading stages. The thing that immediately jumped out was the appearance of the letter 'Q' in Turkmen words. No such letter in their alphabet.Having said that, though - It is, indeed, a very useful tool for people learning the language, or in search of a dictionary that facilitates translation of materials written in modern Turkmen (instead of transliterating in your head as you search for words in the old Cyrillic dictionary).I hope the authors take no offense at my first remark, it is meant to be constructive!"
1,"THE NORMAL BOOK FOR LEARNER,THE WORST FOR NATIVE SPEAKERS.",I have openned this book and surprised by all translations.I am native Turkmen and this book could be better written by native speaker of this language.
3,Somewhat trite retelling of this classic story,"The Chinese language text seems to be ""politically correct"" hack retelling from the People's Republic, filled with jingoistic sentiments. I would not want to read the Chinese version to my kids. The English language version softens and rephrases some of the more irritating parts of the Chinese text, the artwork is OK, and young children actually seem to LIKE the simplistic rhyming, so I'm assigning three stars. If you want a close translation of the original poem with wonderful illustrations, buy Jeanne Lee's book. If you want a good prose retelling of the story with lots of details added (the original poem is somewhat elliptical in phrasing and short in detail) then buy Robert San Souci's book."
3,"Didn't meet my expectations, about Angels!","Wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I thought it was fine! I wouldn't recommentd it, however. I wish Sophy Burnham would issue her work on CD also. Cassettes are so outdated."
5,A Very Candid Memoir,"I bought this book because my father served in North Africa and Italy and I wanted some history on those theatres of the war, which my father had not shared with me.Instead of another historical account, filled with facts and figures, I found a very personal story of one man's experiences.A few pages into the book, the author offers a translation of commonly used army expletives of the time. It let me know right away that this was going to be a candid and sometimes humorous memoir.For anyone who would like to see the war through one soldier's eyes, I would recommend this book."
1,Buyer Beware,"I utilized the parts sizer to verify the this wiper refill would fit my 2008 Acura RDX, however, the width is entirely too narrow and it doesn't even come close to fitting. I'm extremely disappointed because Amazon is usually better than this."
3,More stars for Bob - less for this DVD release...,I find it harder and harder to accept that in an age of hi-def blu-ray and 3D television we still get older films released on DVD that do not present the entire image as filmed by the director. The pan-and-scan versions of Bob's widescreen films on this set are simply unacceptable. If proper elements were lacking after a thorough search of the (Paramount?) vaults and elsewhere then we should have been duly notified in the package. As it is I find this set no better than the old public domain versions that float around. I applaud Shout! for recognizing a market for Bob Hope films on DVD; I chastise them for not taking us seriously by giving us crappy versions. We're not all old codgers who don't know the difference between P&S and widescreen and don't know when they're being ripped off. I'll gladly pay more for the next set if that's what it takes for them to do it right.
4,The Bob Hope Collection Volume Two,"A great set with one complaint, The Great Lover was Not very good copy, it was watchable and thats about it. Apart from that all the others were all good copies.Well worth the money.Ken Barrett Mooroolbark Australia."
2,Reviewing wrong product,"Most of the reviews so far are for VOLUME 1, not this VOLUME 2. Don't be mislead, Volume 2 films are a pretty bad group."
3,2002-03 Edition,"This was probably my fault, but this was the 2002-03 edition. Murach's still has the examples on their website, but MS doesn't offer the 2003 Visual Studio express edition anymore, so this may be a potential problem. Make sure to order the 2010 edition."
4,Good beginners Guide,"As a professional developer, I am constantly looking to upgrade my skills. This time around, I chose .NET. Specifically, VB.NET and ASP.NET. I looked around grabbing every book I could on the subject to learn it fast.Anne Price's book fell into my hands. At first, I first mistook it for a training manual from an expensive training seminar. It is written in a no nonsense format without all the extra filler. Each chapter covers a topic, with examples, exercises, objectives, and the necessary information to understand the topic.Unfortunately, given the scope of VB.NET no one author can offer depth and cover everything. Likewise, Price doesn't delve deeply into ADO.NET, XML, web services, or ASP.NET. But you will get some exposure as she does cover them."
3,Beginning Visual Basic .NET,"If you're an absolute beginner, you might find this book helpful. Otherwise find another book. If you've worked with VB6, almost everything covered in this book (with the exception of the very brief coverage of ADO Net) is almost intuitive.What irritates me most is the poor grammar. Practically every paragraph has a sentence starting like ""Then, ..."". The ""Then"" phrase is not needed and the comma is erroneous.I do use it, however, for a quick reference regarding file IO.If you want to know how to write a (useful) class, generate and handle events, and other slightly more advanced concepts, this book won't help you."
5,Great Book!,"Wow! What a great book. Thanks Anne for writing it. I have been dabbling around windows and OOP for the last few year thinking it was needlessly complicated. Now, I finally get it. Visual Studio .net really gives necessary productivity gains to make the programming productive and worthwhile. I finally get OOP concepts like ""protected members"". Great book. Note: The sections on ASP.NET and ADO.NET are introductory -- Anne Price and Doug Lowe cover them in detail in seperate Murach books."
1,Do NOT buy this book!,"This author is TERRIBLE at trying to teach VB.NET. I don't know about his other books, but I will NEVER buy one of them again! He makes too many assumptions that you already know a lot about VB.NET. His ""example"" coding is horrible. I have some programming experience (although it is somewhat dated) but he gives about a paragraph or two to the topic, then writes a little piece of code, then sums it all up and expects you to be an expert at it. I need a sample of the code and how it works, not just the line it goes in. I would highly recommend you keep looking and NOT buy this terrible book!"
4,A fantastic place to start...,"Great primer for VB.NET. Fun to learn and easy to apply concepts to business models. Complex ideas developed clearly. I would suggest reading Sybex Mastering VB.NET for a deeper understanding of .NET concepts, though, as it goes into depths not covered in the Murach book. It's always good to have more than one angle on a subject.I am not a professional programmer. I run a business that has alot of information running through it. Learning VB has given me the tools to create what I need when I need it. That saves money and allows me to be creative. I love that!"
5,"Zanna's Gift is timeless, beautiful, and full of emotions.","A friend gave me this book simply because my daughter's name is Zanna. I read it and fell in love with it. It speaks about loss and grief and their connection to love. The Pullman's are like so many families in America who left innocence behind too early. But in them there is the hope of things to come, the love of what was, and the joy for what will be. Read it today and start thinking of how you can leave a gift like Zanna's for the world to love."
4,Excellent book but...,"As I said in the title, this book is great but has one minor problem. Henty loved history, and many times he talks about the setting in history for between 3 and 7 pages. But all in all it is a really good book."
5,Best Practice for the PE,"This book best mirrors the type and layout of the PE exam questions. Solve every problem in it, then document your solutions (""How did I solve that type of problem""). This book is far more realistic in difficulty and layout than the ""6 Minute"" books. Get this book first, do the problems in it, then decide what other books you need."
4,A Key to 300 Years of Russian History,"The book seams to me a real treasure for teaching Russian History of XVIII - XX centuries. While it is handy it is reach enough of important facts and comments on the evolution and decline of the Great Empire. It embraces the best of the both worlds giving us a very careful and well balanced epic picture based on some of the most important soarces as well as on the academic literature. Fortunately the book is free of ideological bias so typical for russian studies of almost any origin.Neatly structured, supported by detailed notes, chronology, index, and extreamly useful ""Tables and Statisics"" the book serves as an almost perfect key to 300 years of The Great but Fragile Empire and at the same time offers its own unprejudised analysis of primary problems of Russian and comparative history. The only dissapointment i have is that the author stops short of writing about the modern Russia."
4,Horses,"Here is an amazing account, using evolution, of the horse family starting with horses as we know them today, going back in time to when horses were first mentioned in history. Another fascinating section shows how horses have been used in art and mythology."
4,The Car & Locomotive Cyclopedia,A very impressive reference book. Details are abundant with plenty of accompanying text to aquaint even the newest of railroading fans. The quality is sufficient influence to seek out earlier editions.
4,Great Bk on American Zen,"Joko Beck really has created a unique brand of American Zen, which is one of the reasons I liked this one so much - not a lot of Japanese mumbo jumbo. Most the Zen Books out there right now are not that simple to understand and have terminology you have to be a Buddhist scholar to interpret. Also, check out Open Mind Zen - it's another American Zen style book that is intelligible to the average reader."
5,"Life is not so special .All ideas are illusion,May be!","Miro says:""All Ideas are illusions.May be.Charlotte Joko Beck give us insight in our selfes,Its wonderfull and with the brain not to understand."
1,Great beginning... that was about it...,"I loved the opening of the first chapter, and the metaphor about what we call ourselves being nothing more than a whirlpool in the river of life. Great metaphor. Love it.The rest of the book seemed to me to be teaching (and Zen specifically has no teaching and is the destroyer of teachings) and emotions. Beck's slant on Zen seems to me to be getting people to meditated for years (according to her it takes years) and work work work at it. But Zen is not about that, it is about ""nothing to attain and no one to attain it"" period. All this working at it that she recommends fosters a subtle sense of egoism, a belief that there is some goal to reach, something to gain.Perhaps Beck is working with people whose lives are disasters and she is having to keep them busy in the hope that they will someday finally get it???"
4,first few chapters are bitchin,"great gift bookpass it along!if you're stagnating or wrapped up in your cocoon of pain, this book may help.but maybe not.and you know that.but you keep reading books anyway."
4,Sweet story set in small Texas town,"Ms. Woods has again captured the essence of small town life. While this takes place in Texas, it could be any small town throughout the southern US. The interaction of Mary Lou, her teacher Anne and the members of the singles continuing education class will leave you with the feeling that friends can help you overcome almost anything. And, when you learn where the title of the book comes from, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Everything from life behind the counter at Dairy Queen to a gypsy gathering are in this book. If you like Jan Karon's Mitford books or Billie Letts' Where the Heart Is, I think you'll also enjoy spending time with Roseborough."
4,"GOD is biger than anyone,anything & he is everywhere","no one can ever think of the limit of GOD because he is unlimitedhe is their everywhere,anywhere,all time (past, present & future)"
4,A BOOK TO LOVE AND HATE,"It was hard to understand how Katy fell in love with Iron Wing. After all she was ""given to him"" by his friend whom found her hiding in the carriage that was attacked by another tribe. His punishments to her when she tried to escape or free prisoners would make anyone learn to hate him. However, once they found their feelings for each other (or should I say Katy realized her own feelings toward Iron Wing since he already claimed her), they ended up with constant struggles to stay together. At times Katy seemed spoiled and selfish, escpecially when she returned home and you wanted to shake her for this thoughtlessness really hard. But I was surprised when she changed her tune in favor of Iron Wing. I consider any book that can get you to react to it emotionally, whether it is good or bad emotions, is well written, I did finish this book in only 1 1/2 days."
4,a wonderfuly good read,I loved this book. I like Iron Wing and Katy. Such wonderful characters. I didn't like Iron Wing at first but as the book progressed I found his unwavering loyality to Katy a remarkable thing. Katy was a somewhat spoiled girl that found true love with the proud but kind hearted(after a time)Iron Wing. I did have a problem with Iron Wing whipping Katy in the begining of the book but after that the book was truly wonderful.(though if some one whipped me i would hate them not fall in love with them.)
3,Direct Information about the Weapons not the Lifestyle,"This is a good book for people who doesn't want to know about the whole Guerrilla Marketing theory, but only the weapons it uses. Besides, it is not up to date in some of the weapons. I would rather to recommend ""Startup Guide to Guerrilla Marketing: A Simple Battle Plan for First-Time Marketers"" or ""Guerrilla Marketing, 4th edition: Easy and Inexpensive Strategies for Making Big Profits from Your SmallBusiness"" all from the same autor."
1,You don't need this book!,I have lost my 3 hours to read it. Don't loose yours!There is nothing interesting in this book and very easy concept
3,in good conditions,"Nice title, but the content is, in fact, almost what it has been done with regular marketing.Should have a title like ""Refresh yourself and face the market""."
1,Repackaged information.,"It seems to me like Levinson barely put any effort into this book at all. There really is nothing new or groundbreaking in this book. To me, this was just a quick way for him to capitalize on his ""Guerrilla Brand Name"" to make an extra buck with recycled information. The concepts in this book were so basic, they were almost insulting. Maybe if you are 14 years old and have no prior entrepreneurial experience this is the book for you. I felt ripped off. I actually ended up throwing it away... Catchy title, but it does not deliver at all."
2,Designed by people who've never used a fridge,"This thing appears to have been designed by someone who's never actually owned a fridge. The shelves don't actually FIT anything! The only place there's room for anything taller than an Odwalla bottle (like, juice or milk or water pitchers or gallons of anything!) is in the door. There's no real space for condiments bigger than a small jelly jar without taking up valuable shelf space in the main compartment. The fridge part is tiny and the freezer part is oversized (3 big drawers).The egg container holds 8 eggs. Not 6, not 12. 8. Who buys 8 eggs?The fridge itself works great, but I seriously have issues fitting all my food in it. And I'm a single girl. I can only imagine more than 1 person trying to put food into this- what a nightmare!"
3,Pretty good.,"The size of this fridge was perfect for us, but it does have some issues with temperature control. No matter the setting, no matter the placement in the fridge, our kale always seems to freeze... Also, being vegans, it's a bit obnoxious to see ""meats"" written on the drawer, but this was easily remediable with some alphabet stickers :)"
3,You get what you pay for,The high chair is not bad for the money however it is not as sturdy as you would think a high chair should be. It went together with only a little bit of trouble on one leg. The tray is large and does not fit in a dishwasher but cleans up nice with soap and water.I think if you are using this on a daily basis you might want to go with one that has caster wheels on the bottom as this one must be lifted to move it making it more of a chore to put up at the table like my family does.Over all not a bad choice for someone who is on a budget lets face it kids need so many things if you can save money on a high chair this is not a bad one to buy. I would buy it again if needed.
4,Good deal!,It is wonderful deal for the price. I especially like the safety feature t-bar that holds the child in without the tray!
1,Not safe,"I had bought this at Walmart for my son. I put the chair together properly, although i do not believe the holes were appropriate for the screws. My son was able to tip the chair over and he got hurt. It did not take much movement for that to happen. The safety of my child is the most important thing as I am sure it is for all parents so please reconsider if you are aiming to buy this product."
2,TOO reclined! Flimsy chair,"Of course, you do get what you pay for. However, this chair has NO recline positions, it has only one setting and that is extremely reclined. My son is practically lying back once he is seated. It leads him to slide down and slouch, making it very difficult to feed him, or for him to pick at food on the tray. Also, it is a very flimsy design, making it easy to tip over, if baby were too active.I would not recommend this chair to anyone."
2,Decent chair for the money,I paid way less than 60 bucks at the childrens store. You have to watch how you take the baby out because my baby's legs has got caught and scratched serveral times. Wished the part between the leg came off as well with the tray. Other than that does its job fine. Also a little difficult to set up.
4,Refreshing perspective,"A husband, seperated from his wife, confronts her at their home regarding abuse charges she threatened to file. The wife is found dead from a shogun blast coming from a weapon owned by the husband. An open and shut case? Think again.This book reviews the facts in the case from a criminal defense standpoint. Although it appears to favor the defense team's position, this is hardly surprising considering that the defendant was a collaborator in writing the book. Regardless, this is a classic presentation of a defense investigatioin. Despite the ""Psychic Detective"" nonsense alleged in the book, the author does an excellent job detailing the defense investigator's efforts in uncovering crucial bits of evidence for trial.This book provides a refreshing change of pace to the standard true crime novel which leans heavily toward the police investigation and prosecution."
1,Annoying and one-sided,"I haven't ever read a book that was so one-sided, going back so far as to criticize the deceased wife for not wearing ""grubby"" clothes around the house. The author never misses a chance to slam this woman in an attempt to garner more sympathy for the husband. Anything the husband does is described in the most flattering terms possible. Such a single-minded account does not ring true and the simple minded writing is annoying."
3,I wanted to like it so much more...,"Wow - I've read just the first few reviews and wonder if maybe I read a different book than the others. Yes, the story is compelling, and I truly wanted to love this book, but the author's writing style is rather amateur, in my opinion. She repeated some facts several times - was it to make a longer book? Plus, in one line, she mentions Amanda, the deceased woman's daughter, as being ""step-sister"" to her mother's two younger daughters. Hello, she is their half-sister because she shares a common parent. Am I being too persnickety? Perhaps, but if I had paid for this book, I would have been sadly disappointed in the overall. The editor missed typos as well as spelling and grammatical errors, which made it difficult to concentrate on the story at times. And in stories such as this, it's so helpful to include an index so one could cross-reference all the characters involved - or at least go back to where they were first introduced."
1,Not for me....,"I have read three Jane Feather novels (the Bride trilogy) and enjoyed them immensely. However, this novel was not what I thought it would be. From the very beginning, I didn't buy into the love story between Magdalen and Guy. When they started having an affair, (she was still married, but her husband was asssumed dead), I was fairly disgusted by the whole thing and I quickly lost interest in the whole book. Of course, this is just my opinion...but I was very disappointed. I liked the character of Guy, but I think he could have been utilized in a better way with a different type of heroine."
4,a love story with a catch...,"Magdalen was born of an illicit affair between a powerful English prince and his French mistress. She is a pawn in the struggle between England and France from her first breath, but all she knows is that she longs for adventure. When the handsome knight Guy de Gervais comes to escort her to her betrothed, Magdalen sees the one and only love of her life. Guy sees his responsibility to keep her safe until she can wed his nephew and fulfill her political destiny. As Magdalen matures into a stunningly beautiful woman Guy must fight his love and desire for the one woman he cannot have.The love story is sweet, but Magdalen is so afraid of losing Guy's affection that she defers to him on even the most mundane matters, so it's hard to see her as a ""strong"" heroine. Even though she is married to a man who truly cares for her, she has an affair with Guy without feeling any guilt or remorse. I prefer my heroines to be more morally-minded.Jennifer Johnson"
1,Not Innocent Enough,"I first fell in love with Jane Feather's work with WIDOW'S KISS and went on to read some previous works. I picked up this one and was intrigued by the story line. After reading some of these reviews, I still thought I'd give it a try for myself. I love historicals, especially medievals and am very familiar with that part of history. Knowing that in those days girls were betrothed as young as 8 or 9 years old, her young age didn't bother me. It was the adultery I couldn't get my mind around. Let's be real. In those days, if it were known, she'd have been hanged or tortured to death. Eloquent prose is one thing, having a ""heroine"" commit the unpardonable is another."
1,Almost Insufferable Heroine,"I could not recommend this book, the characters were just not ones that I could give a hoot about. Adulterous, selfish heroine; this book could've easily been half the size and virtually nothing crucial to the story would've been harmed--namely, because there wasn't much of a plot. Even when the big, spoiled baby heroine, Magdalen, finally beds her man-- it's such a let down! I kept waiting for Magdalen to get her richly deserved comeuppance, but I waited in vain. Don't waste your time."
2,"Had Potential, But...","This book was written in a very matter-of-fact tone and evokes little emotion in the reader. The story is good and could be interesting if the reader were drawn into it at all. Unfortunately, the book reads more like a textbook and did little to hold my interest. The more dramatic scenes were over-done and almost laughable.I usually devour romance novels and I could hardly bring myself to finish this one. Sorry!!"
1,More a history lesson than a romance,"I have recently discovered Jane Feather and I like her. This book though is more for the History Student and Literature kind of person. I myself am just a simple housewife and mom and if I have to search the dictionary more than three times to know what the author is saying or learn to speak french than I have lost all interest. I just want a simple historical romance with perhaps a little history to set the scene but too much of anything is no good. I don't speak french and I didn't study old english so it was quite unenjoyable to read this book. Also, it was nice and very well done of Jane Feather to be so accurate to the times but if the buyer of the book doesn't understand it what good is her accuracy?"
3,ineresting,"I couldn't put this book down. I had to know what would happen next. I liked how she showed you the charater from childhood to adulthood. This was my first Jane Feather novel but later I read the Diamond Slipper and the story line was almost the same. Girl falls in love with proxy husband, but ends up married to a horrible man, who ends up dying in the end, leaving them together. Then I read the back cover of Bold Destiny and it also sounds like it has the same story line. Of course they all have their differences but it's basically the same. But this book was the first that I read and I liked it. It was one of the few books I've read that the female goes down on the male."
2,Decent Optics Poor Construction,You get what you pay for. While the optics on these binoculars are a value for the money the construction leaves a lot to be desired. Any heavy use of these binos is more than likely beyond its limits. Got caught out in a very light drizzle and the resulting fog in the binoculars rendered them useless for over a week.
4,Gorgeous,"Her voice ... what an amazing voice! Smoky, pure vowels, beautifully sung, and with a voice perfectly suited for the material. By far the best version I've listened to of the Misa Criolla. Everyone I've played it too swoons.WIsh they'd thought a bit more about the whole sound, though. The other material I could have done without. And when I'm still in heaven at the end of the Misa Criolla, I find it quite jarring suddenly being plunged into something altogether different."
5,Beautiful Rendition of Misa Criolla!,"Mercedes Sosa has been on my radar screen for a long time and I really enjoy her music. Another thing that I really enjoy is ""Misa Criolla"" - the Catholic mass from the Argentine. It is beautiful...very moving, very touching. Ms. Sosa does an excellent job with her rendition. I would highly recommend it."
4,More folklor than classic,"The recording is first rate, with natural tones and very good reverberation (even though it sounds a little artificial). The performance is also great with emphasis on the folkloric element compared with the also excelent performance of the same play by Jose Carreras. All in all a very pleasing CD."
2,KITCH!,"This is a spectacular recording, with an excellent choir and players.Well, this is the good side of this CD.The weak side is all the rest.First, Sosa is very far away from her zenith - though she still have some moments. In the original recording, made in the 60's, there were 3 soloists, each of them sang more beautifully than Sosa, and as a group of 3 it was much more interesting and exciting.Second, these 2 most beutifull pieces turn here to be on the verge of kitch - worser, on the verge of ""world music""!The tempo that ricardo hagman choose is slow, so slow, but without any intrinsic reason, unless - and i suspect that this the truth - he wanted to sound very ""spiritual""...I suggest to any one who wants to listen to the real thing to buy the original recording. For an exciting interpretation, search also the version by Enzo Gieco."
5,An Alternative View,"As for purposes of enlightenment, as usual the mainstream history of WWII is mostly baloney. Lindbergh was a decent and civilized man whose side of the story is both fascinating and deserving of hearing. You can't do better for your entertainment dollar than this"
2,Thought provoking entries by controversial figure,"By the time WWII began Charles Lindbergh was firmly entrenched in the Isolationist movement and no friend of FDR's. He was confident Germany would defeat all of her opponents and rule Europe. He didn't figure on the Japanese however and once the war began however he wanted to contribute but not in uniform (afraid of Roosevelt ordering him to a cubby hole somewhere) so he found jobs testing aircraft and giving flying advice to pilots in the South Pacific. A brilliant but also incredibly naive man, Lindbergh basically found himself a man without a country only two decades after his remarkable achievements."
3,Not for beginners,"I teach ESL to beginners who are still learning simple present verbs and this book starts off with both grammar and vocabulary that is a bit too advanced for a true beginning class. I do like the stories and the general lay out. I use the more advanced version of this book for my intermediate class.I was hoping the stories would be like the Very Easy True Stories, which are perfect for beginners. Very simple, all in present tense."
3,Too normal for me....,"I love Sixteen Horsepower's ""Sackcloth and Ashes."" I was a little a disappointed by ""Secret South""; it sounds almost mainstream. Well, perhaps that's a stretch. The stand-out track is a Bob Dylan cover, ""Nobody 'Cept You."" If you love 16 Horsepower's other stuff, you'll still like this."
5,Music for the Soul,"Friends of mine turned me on to this band a few years back. I keep thanking them for their generosity.16 HP's latest epic lacks some of the interesting flourishes from their earlier albums, such as the concertina. With any other band that could be dangerous. Not this band. Vocalist David Eugene Edwards still comes across like he's charming the snakes from the hills, setting the album afire with his views of heaven and hell. By the third listen the entire set sinks in and that's it, you will be throwing this offering on the player almost every day. It's that intriguing.Take it from someone who normally runs from country to embrace a Nine Inch Nails CD. This harmonious album surpasses all musical boundaries and ultimately conquers them all. 16 HP delivers haunting, soul-driven music for folks bored with the mundane drivel set before the masses. 16HP is the real deal, kids."
1,REALLLLLLYYYY HORRIBLE QUALITY,PLEASE DO NOTTTTTT BUY THISSSSS!!!!!! The phone doesn't slide open with this cover on. If you still try real hard.. the cover comes off with it.. it almost spoilt my display.. pleaseeee do not buy this.. unless u hate ur phone
1,Bad Editing,The 'Giant Behemoth' is a classic Brit scfi movie. The problem with the VHS version is that the entire ferry boat scene was omitted. The DVD version is unedited and the quality is much better. The VHS probably came from the public domain.
2,The Giant Behemoth,"NOW LETS GET THIS STRAIGHT TO BEGIN WITH: EVEN THOUGH OLD AND DATED I LIKE THIS MOVIE. BUT ON THIS DVD RELEASE THE STUDIO COULDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO CLEAN UP THE PRINT. AND THE COMMENTARY TRACK IS DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST, AND I AM BEING VERY GENEROUS. UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE THIS MOVIE DON'T BUY THIS 'CULT CAMP CLASSIC' RELEASE! VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
3,Cheesey fun,"Back in the 50's, there was a television show called ""Million Dollar Movie"". It showed the same film every night at 7:30 and again on Saturday afternoon. This was my first exposure to ""The Giant Behemoth"". I watched it every night, much to the dismay of my parents who would have preferred a little more diversity in their viewing. Million Dollar Movie was a 90 minute time slot so truncated versions of the films were shown. This DVD is actually the first time I have seen the film in it's entirety. Not a great movie but so typical of the 50's monster movie genre you can't help but enjoy it. The DVD is letterboxed and the picture and sound quality very good. The special effects are laughable but that is always part of the fun with these movies.An entertaining evening's viewing. I only rate it as 3 stars simply because to rate it higher would be elevating it to a class of many better sci-fi films. Definitely worth owning, though."
2,The Giant Behemoth,"This movie was okay. In spots there were some flickering, but it played all the way through. I have seen other black and white movies with better picture quality."
2,the giant waste of time,"What a disappointment! I had not seen this since the late 60's, when I was just a boy. The name of Willis O'Brien lured me, but the very ordinary commentary tells us that Obie had very little to do with the production. Incidentally, the two doing the commentary seem to know less about the movie than I do! Try as I might, I can't recommend this to any monster movie enthusiast."
3,"One of the better ""giant menace"" films.","An oft-underrated film, one of the better ""giant menace"" films. Hampered by extremely low special effects budget, but well-directed, with a crisp, no-time-wasted approach, and nicely atmospheric. This might be the first movie to address the problem of radioactive waste."
3,"Classic film, MISSING KEY SCENE THOUGH!","A Great film but shame on Warner Bros. for releasing an edited version! Film quality is good, but the FERRY SCENE where the creature attacks and sinks the ferry is MISSING! Great sequence involving people boarding a ferry for an afternoon ride, when suddenly the creature attacks. Old woman eating, little girl with doll, full ship of people become victims of the beast. Memorable last scene in this sequence showing bodies floating, burned from the creatures radioactive rays, gruesome, yet an important part of the movie, What Happened To This Scene? Too long to blame it on broken film, obviously they used an Edited print! Too bad, hopefully the eventual DVD release will be INTACT! And COMPLETE!"
2,Another Radioactive Critter on steroids runs amok. . .,"In fairness, the Giant Behemoth suffers badly from some rather ambitious filmmaking that simply didn't have the technology needed to bring off the special effects. The plot line is average for this genre, although very predictable. In many ways, this is a low budget clone of ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms."" Still, the film manages to hold one's attention, and benefits from a nasty if not terribly original ending. The Giant Behemoth is nothing to write home about, but you won't be reaching for the remote control, either."
5,Good for a monster movie made in 1959.,"""The Giant Behemoth"" or ""Behemoth, The Sea Monster"" (as it is known in England) is one of the finer monster movies of the 50's. The effects were pretty fake, but hey it's the 50's. The acting was not bad, the story line may have been better if the monster it's self was featured more in it. Did anyone besides me notice that the monster's head didn't move when it sunk the fairy. I read this was because the monster's head was broken off, and with no time to fix it, they nailed it back on for the filming of that scene. It's a good one if you like old movies!"
3,A good fast forward movie,"Don't bother with the story, or the acting. This is one of those movies where you fast foward to the monster's rampages. Willis O'Brien ( of ""King Kong"" fame ) does some of the best effects since that mighty ape conquared the top of the Empire State Building in 1933! On a sad note, this is the last film he did the effects on. What makes the movie cool is the setting which is England. I keep hoping for The Beatles or Austin Powers to appear in the mess of people scurring from the monster ( although The Beatles didn't appear popular for nearly 6 or so years after this film was made ). The non stop motion scenes are awful. All the scenes just showing monster close ups was just a terrible display of just a hard plastic mold of his head, where the mouth or eyes didn't move at all. All in all, this is a pretty interesting B movie with kicks and everything that alot of those kind of movies didn't have, but this one does!"
1,Fed up waiting,"I'd love to write a review, but as of 19 July, it hasn't arrived. Perhaps others should be aware of the inordinate time it seems to take to get stuff to the U.K."
1,Glorifying a white con man impersonator with bad writing,"""Swiftdeer's"" real name is Harley Reagan, a blond white guy who sometimes impersonates being Cherokee and sometimes impersonates being Mayan. And some are dumb enough to fall for it. Some are also apparently dumb enough to believe that Eastern Mysticism is the same as Native American, that sex orgies are part of Cherokee beliefs, and that being a gun toting survivalist, pimp, and pervert extraordinaire are compatible with being an Indian medicine man...Some gullible New Agers and shame-on wannabes will still undoubtedly be dumb enough to throw their time, money, and even their lives away on this fraud, just like...Porsche Lynn did."
5,ancho peppers,"These are the freshest dried peppers I have had since I lived in Texas. Difficult to find in PA groceries, but hard and brittle when you do, these arrived in airtight jars with that pliant feel you want in a pepper that has been packed right after drying. I bought 3 jars for a lot of enchilada sauce and beans and rice."
3,Good but incomplete,"I have lived in Manhattan for 13 years, and when it was time to buy I picked up this book. I found it fun to read and helpful in understanding for example the commuting times to each area featured, etc. However it does not include every neighborhood, in fact the area where we finally purchased (Ft. Greene Bklyn) isn't even included in the book. Buy this book used, along with the Zany's guide and you'll get the full picture without spending too much $."
1,Book is grossly outdated,"Book published in 1999, and is in ***serious*** need of updating. NY real estate has transformed immensely in the last 7 years (as have most major cities in the US). For that reason, I found the book to be of very little use to my move."
2,There are better guides out there,"I was surprised to find out that areas I thought should be in this guide were not and that areas I wouldn't consider ""around New York"" were. To me, a neighborhood ""in and around New York"" might include some NJ towns, but to give as much time to the towns listed in NJ and CT, I think the book would more accurately be titled ""all about popular communities in the tri-state area.""I'm disappointed I bought this guide."

1,Does not last,"I too, had the same problem as another customer. After a month the seams in the pants ripped , in the front no less. The jacket is still holding up but the pants are useless. Very disapponited in my purchase. My best advice , read lots of reviews and shop around."
5,Nice Gift,I really think this was the perfect gift for a friend with all the rain we have been having lately.
3,rainsuit,"The suit is well made, but the front is a snap closure. It would work better if it were a zipper."
3,9it works but wont stand up to a beating,"so i got this while deployed to adana turkey for the rainy season. it was effective at first but when your out side in a cargo airlift enviroment, this won't last. the pants were first to tear, and some how i m amazed they still resisted water for the last two months i was there. but it u need a rainsuit to stand up to the weather and last in a constant fast paced cargo enviroment, get something thicker."
5,Good overview of Ohio History,This book was for years the standard Ohio history text used in schools throughout the Buckeye State. It was written by an Ohio University history professor. If you want to learn the basics of Ohio history this book is a good place to start.
3,light but insoles suck,I bought these boots after reading reviews. I am not that impressed with them. I like that they are lighter than my danners and have the side zip which is a ten. These boots would be four stars if the insole was better. After wearing them for 2 ten hour shifts my feet hurt bad. There are no support provided from these boots and this is the first time the arches of my feet have hurt. I will be trying out Dr. Scholls or something to make the boots feel more comfy. I usually like 5.11 products but will not buy another boots made by them.
5,"5.11 ATAC, Coyote tac boots","5.11 seems to me to be the best boot company.Great boots at a economical price. Also Amazon was ultra fast in the delivery, good job to themRight out of the box these boots were comfortable and required little break in time, like 2 days worth. That being said now in the North Ear we are getting bad weather lots of snow and cold. I decided to try em out for a five mile hike to see how they would perform in snow.The tread held up and never did I slip or even question the tread in the boots. My feet felt insulated while they stayed dry. However the suede did soak through.However the desert boots held up waterproof for most of a 5 mile hike through six inch snowfall.The tread is not quick wear flat stuff like other boots. Though I think of the 5.11 ATAC boots as the best boots I ever owned, to be fair the flap that runs underneath the zipper could be made of more firmer leather. it folds up underneath when zipped :)"
5,Best boots I have ever owned,"I was a little leary at first ordering boots from Amazon. No test fit, no feeling the material. I have owned a lot of boots from a lot of different companies. I will refrain from bashing anyones so lets just say I have tried all the top brands. Over the years I have had different degrees of success with boots. Some I have worn out and some I try one day and then off to salvation army. Now that I am older (50 almost) finding comfortable boots is getting harder. Overall fit and finish out of the box on these was perfect. I tried them on and they fit comfortable were soft and easy to f;ex. I am very happy and these will be worn out before I toss them. I am so happy I am ordering another pair in black for a backup. Fit trim quality are excellent.. Thanks"
5,How to Build a Simple Yet Elegant Canoe,"Looking for something interesting to do about three months ago, I bought a copy of this book. It claims that with a few simple hand tools (and a lot of C-clamps), a neophyte can produce a very nice canoe in a reasonably short period of time, which I found to be true. The author breaks the construction process down into some 260 small steps, which makes it difficult to get confused or frustrated. It's apparent that the author had taken many students through the building process before he wrote the book. Then, once the canoe is built, he goes into great detail on painting and varnishing, where I was surprised to see how little I already knew. Following his advice, my canoe turned out much nicer than I would've expected. This is an excellent book on construction and finishing of stitch-and-glue canoes."
5,well detailed,"I've only previewed the book at this point, but the lists of necessary tools and materials are very complete. Procedures are explained step by step. I feel that anyone with a basic aptitude for woodworking and a good helping of patience, could build this boat."
5,fantastic engrossing story in a unique fascinating setting,"It is hard to understand why some people panned this book. It is in such an interesting setting, the story line is tightly woven, and the writing superb. Those who said it was slow didn't appreciate the historical setting in which the novel takes place. One of the best books I've read in years. Once I got 1/3 of the way into it, I couldn't put it down."
3,Strong theme,"What is interesting here is the author's crafting of a number of characters who are not simple Nazi bad guys, but like many Germans, were caught up in the system as National Socialism took hold over everyday life. While the author is no apologist for Nazism, this intelligent angle forces us to think about how we (and people we know) might react in similar circumstances (and feel after the event). The plot, which involves the usual murder scenario, isn't too interesting in itself, but it does provide a way for the author to focus on the motivation of his characters, although we learn much less about the main character - the American reporter - than we do about the Germans. The research evident here is always interesting but never intrusive."
2,The Boring German,"Four hundred and eighty one pages but The Good German seems much, much longer.Flat, unconvincing characters talk and talk and talk page after page, spouting dialogue as unconvincing as it is lengthy.This is movie of the week material. Berlin is NOT brought to life convincingly at all and in fact I grew tired of yet another description of the piles of brick which made up the city there in mid-1945.One problem I had is that the characters are so poorly rendered it was impossible to muster much enthusiasm for their travails. The Americans are indistinguishable from one another and Jake Geismar (the 'hero') himself is far too sketchily drawn (no small feat when he appears on each of the 481 pages) to be of any interest at all.Save your money (and save a big hunk of time) and buy the Alan Furst books. Infinitely better reads."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"AFTER READING THE NY TIMES REVIEW, I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK..AND I FOUND IT TO BE LESS EXCITING THAN I EXPECTED..THE COVERAGE OF THE POST-WAR SCENE IN BERLIN WAS GOOD ,BUT THE AUTHOR CIRCLED AROUND THE STORY FOR SUCH A LONG TIME THAT IT BECAME BORING.TOO MANY CHARACTERS THAT I DIDNT CARE FOR AND HAD LITTLE INTEREST IN..LENA AND JAKE WERE SYMPATHETIC CHARACTERS, BUT AS A PREVIOUS REVIEWER SAID, ONE COULD NOT CARE VERY MUCH FOR THE DEAD MAN PRESENTED IN THE START OF THE BOOK."
2,Not good,"This book had a lot of potential. The post WWII Berlin setting and the dynamics of looking back at what had been done during the war - It's a captivating subject: Wondering how Germany people had been able to watch and be involved with the atrocities; the jockeying of the US and Russia knowing they'd be adversaries after the war; the scrambling to acquire German technical secrets and experts.The history surrounding the book was what kept me reading. But the plot of this novel is convoluted, the relationships are not well realized, and there are some coincidences that are totally unbelievable. Honestly I should have stopped reading after the second blatantly unrealistic plot connection, but like an addict, I kept reading on. Wasn't worth it. Kanon is a capable writer and good at dialogue, but this book is way too long, a complicated mess and it feels like it was unsuccessfully pared down from many more pages."
2,Could have been so much better,"I was really gripped by this book to start with. The descriptions of Berlin, the people, Jake's yearning for Lena... But after he finds her (all too easily) it all goes downhill. Why does he care so much about the ""mystery"" ? Why is he prepared to put his own life, and hers, at risk ? I lost interest in the twists and turns so much that when eventually the ""villians"" were revealed I'd forgotten who they were. A much better book would have simply been about Jake's search for Lena and her struggle to come to terms with what happened to her and her country. The ""mystery"" was unnecessary. And one other thing really bothered me (spoiler alert !) - when he first finds her she can't even bear his touch after her horrors at the hands of the Russians. Then 5 mins later its all la-di-da and this is never mentioned again. Not believable I'm afraid."
5,Historical fiction,"A great read and very informative of the aftermath of WW II and the history of the period of the Nuremburg trials.It's well researched, creative and well written."
3,The good with the bad,"I enjoyed this in spite of the plot getting out of control. Some of the twists were just twists to fill space I felt. The charaters--Jake and Lena at least--were fairly well developed and believable even if the actions and events were not always very believable. This may sound like a negative review, but as a history lover I found this a great read. I loved the detail about ""ordinary life"" in such an extra ordinary time and place."
2,disappointed,"having read the fine review in the ny times, i HAD to read this book..the portrait of berlin after ww 2..was very good, but the author took too long to bring the story to a satisfying conclusion..lots of characters who mattered little to this reader..the main characters evoked some sympathy, but the story of the dead man added little to the drama.."
1,"Incredibly ponderously written, laborious reading","The author obviously did his research, and he wants to prove it by going over the most minute details ad nauseum. This is one of the most tedious books I've ever tried to read, and one of only perhaps half a dozen I've had to give up on in the last 40 years. I think it's unfortunate that it is so poorly done, because the essential story could have had merit if the author wasn't so overburdened in his love of detail and too many names. He also relies on continually repeating a description of wartown Berlin. After the first dozen or so examples, it's time to move plot, not focus on setting. I regretfully suggest you skip this book. Read the Publisher's Weekly report above. They can be harsh but are frequently accurate. I gave my copy of this book to the library's fundraiser - unread beyond 30 pages."
3,Interesting historically,"I had a bit of a hard time with the cumbersome plot plodding along, and found the book at times confusing. Historically, however, the book was very informative about the period after WWII generally and about Berlin specifically re a populace living in the most dire circumstances. (Though my most favorite after-WWII read is The Good American by Ursula Maria Mandel, also at Amazon). In general, The Good German was a good, suspenseful read. There were moments one couldn't put the book down, and others, when one just wanted to turn the pages to get on with the plot."
2,"Great writer...dull, bloated book","1) Since the plot has to match history and this book doesn't offer any new twists the story feels contrived and just plods along.2) Two leading characters are overwrought, self-absorbed and their love for each other doesn't feel rooted in anything.3) Plot includes a ""Casablanca""-like love triangle, but without any of those characters' color, warmth or humor.4) Supporting characters are all drawn to be a suspicious lot whose sole purpose seems to be to explain the tough realities of war.5) 500 pages is way too long for a 150 page plot...too much period detail is crammed in without any regard for flow. This should have been a book you can't put down and instead it took me three weeks to finish."
3,AN ATTEMPT TO OUTDO JOHN LECARRE,"This was an interesting read - at times slow and boring , then almost equal to John LeCarre at his Cold War best and finally closed out as if the author was tired of it or had his publisher on his back to get it finished .I can understand why the first third of the book was slow since there werE many characters to establish and the circumstances pertaining in Berlin at the end of the war had to be shown to the reader . Having got through this phase the author produced about half of the book which was very much a John LeCarre story with twists and turns typically of his Berlin stories .Then the last part of the book seemed to lose the thread and to become a convoluted who-done-it which very quickly lost the trend of thestory which it had built up.A shame,it could have been such a good book!"
4,Walkers by Graham Masterton,I picked this book up just to pass time at first. But once you see there's more to Jack Reed the story progresses' quickly and becomes a real page turner. I'm not going to give too much away but I do recommend this book. It may make you think once or twice about creaks you hear in your house. lol
3,"Not bad, not great","I got this book shortly before Halloween -- I was looking for a good thriller for the season, but it was just okay. It started kinda slow, and I didn't really feel any sort of attachment towards the characters, but the plot and the action picked up pretty well about 1/3 of the way through. I liked the story well enough, it had some interesting ideas, but it didn't have the ""oompf"" to make me care much about the characters, and it was sort of predictable. All in all, not bad, not great."
1,Only for the uninitiated,"You'll probably like this book if you've never read a good horror novel. Otherwise, be prepared to slap your forehead at regular intervals. I found Masteron's overly simple, patronizing narrative style hard to bear, but the sheer idiocy of the plot made me grind my teeth with every page turned. In fact, this is one of the rare books I simply couldn't force myself to finish - not because is was ""scary"" in any way, but for the simple reason that life is too short to waste valuable reading time with drivel like this. No wonder it's out of print."
4,Great content poorly presented,"Murphy is still considered one of the leading scholars in the study of Wisdom literature, and this brief introduction proves why. Murphy gives a satisfying and stimulating introduction to biblical Wisdom literature (including Sirach and Wisdom of Solomon) as well as treatments on Wisdom intertextuality, theology, and the metaphor of Woman Wisdom. However, the layout of the book - moving updates to separate appendices - makes it cumbersome to read, and Murphy's methodology leaves something to be desired. All in all, this is an invaluable resource for lay readers and those without an extensive background in Wisdom studies, but the more advanced scholar will probably be disappointed in this work."
4,Gets the job done,"This book covers everything that is necessary for the exam. It was pretty well organized, and covers everything in enough depth to answer exam questions. The only thing missing is the end of chapter ""cram outline"" - something to stuff into your brain just before the exam.The book did not always incorporate Microsoft's guidance on design issues - what's really included on the exam. I found that the slide decks from Tech Ed (find the one on CA's!) did a better job preparing me for the exam. This exam requires a lot of real world experience - anyone with a CISSP certification should well.The CD has only a few sample questions (mostly not on security), but provides access to the web site for the additional questions. The CD does duplicate the exam format, which is substantially different than the old exams. The CD software crashed with Dr. Watson errors on an NT Workstation, so it took several tries to get through the practice exams."
1,Where's the beef?,"The useful information in this book could easily have been condensed into 25-50 pages. I don't know how it's possible for a person to write this many words and fail to fulfill the basic purpose of a book!The content only lightly scrapes the surface of the topic, and does not adequately prepare a test-taker with the indepth knowledge required for a Microsoft design exam. My other gripe is that the only challenge posed by the questions at the end of the chapters is that they are ambiguous or otherwise poorly worded, often leading to incorrect conclusions.If you buy this book, you will be back looking for a replacement pretty quick.. take a look at the ""Designing Microsoft Windows Network Security MSCE Training Kit"" from MS Press as an alternative, and definitely pick up the MCSE Readiness Review for a better look at what an actually test might be like."
5,a good read,"This is a good story, and can be read just as that. As a fiction yarn it will keep you interested and the characters are realistic.But the book is also a good depiction of what life was like in the mountains of western carolina while the revolutionary war was going on (and was pretty much ignored by those in the mountains.I have spent a lot of time in the area and sometimes I think I can even identify locations which are described in Ehle's books.While much of what Ehle wrote includes a whole series of books about the west carolina area, all the books stand independent, so don't worry about being in the middle of something.Ehle is one of the most under-appreciated writers around."
3,Hard work and self reliance breeds eternal hope.,"The struggle for survival, unity and commmunity in colonial America by sheer determination. The triumph over despair culminating in one's recognition of being."
2,Are you sure this is Kenneth Cole?,"Uncomfortable. Even though I got these on sale, I never wear them so the savings are irrelevant."
3,Still no hummingbirds,I've had two of these for three years and no hummingbirds have moved in yet. I have a lot of hummingbird flowers in my garden and a feeder and lots of hummingbirds live in my yard in the summer. I think they prefer to build their nests in the woods behind the house.
4,New blades for an AP10,My old surface planer needed new blade. I ordered these blades and gauge for installing them. I would really have appreciated some directions or pictures. The blades were sharp and gave my old planer new useful life.
4,Worked just fine,"DH ruined a set of planer blades for a customer he was working for, so we bought these to replace. They fit the way they should and worked just like new."
1,Not for painted wood,"I have used half a dozen sets of blades and they usually last a year or two. But after a few boards, I planed one with paint. It really tore up the blades.It would be best to have carbide blades, but I haven't found any.I am looking for another planer which can handle better blades."
3,Just OK,I bought this album after attending a concert in my area around Christmas time. It was just OK for me.
4,Radiates with Warmth,"Lonestar's Christmas set has a selection of well-known tunes done in country/pop style. While most are quite familiar, they are well done. ""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town"" rocks out. ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" gives a sentimental tug on the heartstrings. ""If Every Day Could Be Christmas"" is a sweet slick pop track. Lonestar's version of ""Little Drummer Boy"" shines with great percussion and the lads' lovely harmonies with a tinge of Celtic flavor. ""Reason for the Season"" is a Lonestar original and the crown jewel of the set, ""He is the light that shines on our lives, baby Jesus born in God's grace so we all might rejoice on this day."" ""What Child Is This"" is a gorgeous melody done with a traditional touch. ""Winter Wonderland"" bobs as a joyful pop excursion. The set concludes with the title track that I think is also an original by the band. ""This Christmas Time"" is a good holiday set that will be a wonderful soundtrack addition for a family holiday Christmas. Enjoy!"
2,No better than cheaper wipers,"I tried to research this choice and found people raved about their Bosch Icons, so sure, I gave it a try. It is now about 10 months later and time to replace them. Longevity? Average. If that were the only problem fine, but these blades worked poorly on my Subaru Forester right from day 1. Don't think I'd ever buy Bosch blades again. Maybe the Valeo 600's?"
2,meh.,"I bought a set of the Bosch Icons for my 2004 Toyota Camry back in January 19th, right after the crazy snowstorms that hammered the New York City area and retired them today, just a week short of 6 months. During the first few months of use they were great, although I did notice that they would actually shake a bit on the lower half when they were in use and I wasn't sure why. They were definitely quieter than the old cheap blades I had on the car.Fast forward 4 months, they stopped making good contact with the windshield (despite cleaning the windshield and the blades) and they would lift off a bit and leave smears. I regularly clean my windshield and apply Rain-X about once a week and I also wipe the wiper blades down to remove the dirt and debris that they could pick up. I was hoping they would last at least a year but my hopes were cut short. All in all, they are definitely overrated and too expensive for the life span it offers. I will not be buying these again."
4,I can see clearly now...,"I have a 2006 Murano and it has funky sized blades. I had trouble jsut finding refills, but these blades are far superior to standard refills.Leaving in Seattle, cutting through the showers, drizzle, fog and the occasional rain is key.Just a little spendy."
2,Wiper Blades,Your vendor was on time and before promised. these wipers seem to streak a little. this is the second set I have bought from Amazon i don't think I will purchace them again
1,TERRIBLE,Katie Holmes should have divorced Tom Loser for making this terrible piece of garbage. Don't watch this if you like good movies.
3,not as bad as I thought it would be...,anyone else think that Michele Monaghan is a dead ringer for Katie Holmes?
2,"Good direction, acting, and cinematography plagued by a weak script and editing...","I like the look and feel of the film, and the acting is solid, but the screenplay is weak and doesn't support the performances. The movie is unbelievably predictable, and the relationships feel shallow and superficial and don't counterbalance the subsequent (re)action very well."
5,Mission: Impossible III (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [HD DVD],I thought I had already reviewed this product. I love the movie. I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
1,Amazon shows MI 2 instead of MI 3,"Waste of money, its playing MI 2 instead of MI 3. Amazon please fix it and play right movie. Yeah, I am not drunk :)"
3,It's OK,Cookie-cutter action . . . cookie cutter action . . . cookie cutter action . . . cookie cutter action . . . cookie cutter action . . . cookie cutter action . . . cookie cutter action . . . cookie cutter action . . . cookie cutter action . . . how many time do I have to write this?!
4,Yiayia's thoughts,Awesome action & a great down time movie. My husband the critic even totally enjoyed the whole movie without falling asleep which is a big deal for us.
4,"Great Movie ,good blu ray","This is my favourite of mission impossible series.The blu ray is just ok,good video transfer 4/5 and also good audio transfer 4/5.Poor supplemental and extras 2/5A must buy for all MI fans"
3,Disappointing,"One of Tom Cruise's biggest disappointments. Overacted and not well done from the perspective of the reputable series. The film had its moments, but not enough to save it from DVD rental oblivion."
2,The reason why people hate Hollywood.,"There are TOO MANY reasons to list why this movie is horrible. Even for a big brainless action movie (which I love sometimes), this one was a joke. The first MI was fun and exciting and had reasonable continuity and ""semi""-believable action sequences. Two, three and four are all parodies of the first it seems. Abrams should stay in the sci-fi genre since ALL belief can be easily suspended there.The supporting cast in this movie was the best part, other than ""Felicity"" and the actor playing his wife. WHY exactly is Cruise popular? After Top Gun, has he done anything worth the paycheque he gets? Maybe Jerry McGuire, since he can portray hapless far better than an action hero.It gets two rather than one star from me for the cinematography and the few good supporting actors...Cruise, Felicity, the wife and Abrams all get a minus 5."
2,Tom Cruise: A Parody of Himself,"Not much more to say about the movie. I don't even know why it included other actors in the cast. Tom could have just fallen in love with himself. Loved the ending, suitably cheesy too. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this piece of crap."
1,Poor quality video,"I love the movie but the quality of the video is terrible. This was my first time buyign a movie on Amazon Prime, I likely will just stick with buying the movies on iTunes."
1,no gracias,"while there were some notable cameos, this film takes itself far too seriously. even The Net is better than this."
1,Yet another Hit,"M:I-3 delivers the goods, but it doesn't step above anything we've seen before. The bridge fight and helicopter chase were the only scenes in the movie that really felt original"
2,they should have stopped at M-II,I was truly disappointed by this movie- the plot was quite weak and I thought that it diverted form the theme ofthe movie series. If you must see it rent it. The only positive thing was that blue-ray offered great picture and sound that made watching it a bit bearable. Pity
2,Cruising to Mediocrity,"Well, Hollywood has delivered another big summer meatball for everyone to enjoy, starring everyone's favorite 50 year old midget action superstar Tom Cruise (aka In Vitro). Not much substance here, some explosions, a few thrills, he gets the girl, kills the bad guy, yada yada. Boring for 90% of the population, but delightful for the other ten. I am with the majority for once on this one, however, as Cruise is even more ridiculous this time around. If they had an award for the actor who can somehow manage to overact WHILE showing no emotion at the same time, he would win every year. Maybe for MI4 he can be in one of those power-scooters those senior citizens drive around, and could engage in battles that way. By the way, I READ THE STUDY on mental health, and I think Tommy Boy needs a check up."
3,ok movie,This movie did not live up to the hype. I thought Kerri Russel would have a bigger role. MI:1 and MI:2 were much better.
2,Not as good as MI2,"Lots of action, but not a lot of surprises. Worth renting but not buying. Great action, good actors, but not good enough. A disappointment."
1,Worst MI of all,"Whereas MI 1 was a great movie with a pretty impossible mission, MI 2 fairly good with also a nice impossible mission, MI 3 has a mission, but we never know how it was accomplished! In the building, out the building and... done. What happened inside we'll never know. Very disappointing"
4,Mission Impossible 3 Blu-ray,"Not quite as good as I expected given the hefty price tag for this Blu-ray version, however the sound is extraordinary and the picture is very good provided you are using a high definition panel and the best in audio video leads."
2,SPOILER WARNING in header,"I am sick, sick, sick SICK! ... and tired of the ""The boss is the evil mastermind behind it all!"" theme in action movies these days.This ruined what could have been a perfectly acceptable action film. Isn't that the same plot theme that ruined the first movie ?!?Nice cast, nice back story, nice main plot. Very cool action sequences and of course, major misdirection by the master of it, JJ Abrams.I lost interest in it about three quarters of the way through and then perked up near the end, even though the scene that woke me up inferred that one human life was not worth as much as another. That theme in movies kills my enthusiasm also.Disappointing. Rent it before you decide to buy."
3,See Tom run. And run. And run.,"I'm still thinking about that great shot at the beginning of Mission Impossible II where Tom Cruise is rock climbing. Nothing in this movie is in that league; even the music is a boring rendition. Even the titles are dull.This time, we begin with a long, noisy, dark scene where (I think) a truck is shooting at a building, but who can tell. All of this is at odds with the original Mission Impossible concept which was to outsmart the bad guys instead of nuking them. And speaking of bad guys, what a waste of Phillip Seymour Hoffman.Three stars because its an action movie but didn't they blow up that bridge in True Lies? And, at the same time, pull Arnold out of a moving car? Guess I'm just imagining things."
2,Needs a heart transplant!,"Hey, this Mission Impossible needs a heart transplant. Note: watch out for spoiler here! But the fact that Cruise needs to be brought back from the dead in this one says it all! No heart! Movie is missing a true heart and soul. About the only thing interesting is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy!"
2,A somewhat boring mission...,"Like many others, I was kinda disappointed in this third movie of the M.I. series. The first half of the movie was ok. What gets me is the plot is way to messed up, and another disappointment is that later in the movie when Ethan was retreiving the 'rabbits foot', we never see any of that mission going on from inside the building, I mean he just comes crashing out of the window with the 'rabbits foot'. And at the end of the movie it just ends, nothing more. To me it seems the director was trying to do this movie cheap, and expect more money in return, by making this movie look like they did there homework, knowing they really didn't."
2,Meh,"If you are hesitant to watch this movie because you think it will just be another lame, brainless Hollywood action movie, you are right."
1,Disappointing at best,Cruise acts similar to the way he acted in public iver the past two years in this movie.Step right up ladies and gentlemen its mid-life crisis time for Mr. Cruise. Hoffman can't play a bad guy ever after his SHARTING performance in along came polly.Oh and did I mention the plot? no? well its m.i. 2 in china. yup these damn mystery viruses and the madmen who want them. Oh and one more thing this time around they plant bombs in the agents heads. That conviently take a while when activated to explode This also allows Cruise to give his worst performance ever. I guess if you get your lifes views from ponyboy your bound to start F n up your career sooner or later
4,"Terrible Music Score / Excellent Movie, Plot, and Action","It had one of the stupidest music scores that I havd heard in a while. Sounded like something reserved for a B-Movie. But thankfully, this only lasted during the second action scene: The assualt on the wharehouse. The rest of the movie was awesome. A 5-star movie with a 1-star music score that seemed quite adolescent. Anyway 4 shining stars."
4,tom cruise is mission impossible king,"First one was good, I missed the second one but the third instalment was well done and full of excitement. The plot was not simple but not overly complex, it is well done."
3,"Kept me awake, but ...","Typical Tom Cruise flick, doing the ""Impossible"". Bad guy keeps good guy alive, for no apparent reason other than to keep the movie going."
3,If you have absolutely nothing else to watch,"This was not a great movie, but if you like the action-thriller scenes, i will probably work for you.I like the earlier Mission Impossible movies, but the basic plot was weak, and it seemed like the actors were having a tough time understanding the plot."
4,Solid mission impossible continuation from a stellar team,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this 3rd installment of Mission Impossible. Honestly, it shouldn't have shocked me (duh, J.J. Abrams and Company). Phillip Seymour Hoffman is fantastic. It's action-packed, funny, and emotional. Michael Giacchino's score underneath everything was just icing on top of the cake for me. This one is a great idea for movie-night if you haven't seen it yet."
4,Great movie,"A great, enjoyable movie to watch.. The entire MI line is great fun. Would rate this as the tied for 2nd best MI movie of the 4."
3,"Action, action, action","If you love an action flick, Tom Cruise and MI3 will more than meet your needs for an adrenaline rush."
4,"Waited six years, kind of regreting it","For one reason or another I kept putting this movie off. Somewhat predictable in most of its plot points. Hoffman is a 2D villain but fills the role of ""aggression focus"" pretty well. I would have given this movie 2 or 3 stars.... but then the last 10 minutes of the movie happened. A very underplayed character shines through and reveals a couple character traits that were overlooked up to that point.Plus Simon Pegg is in it. That is worth a star in itself."
3,Mission Accomplished,"Thanks to director J.J. Abrams, ""Mission: Impossible III"" surpasses the missed opportunities of filmmakers Brian De Palma and John Woo by returning to the core elements of the classic TV series. In the memorable villain department, Philip Seymour Hoffman kicks it up a notch and gives IMF agent Tom Cruise a run for his money. The pace rarely lags as Abrams stages several stunt-filled setpieces while surrounding Cruise with a solid acting ensemble. Unfortunately, the film's perfunctory climax squanders a potentially exciting showdown between Cruise and Hoffman - an obvious sign of budgetary shortcuts. Despite this lapse, the third time is definitely the charm for the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise."
3,Some May Like it Others Won't,"This was too tense and stressful for my liking. It starts with a clip from near the end and you are wondering what is going to happen all the way through. So if you like that out of sequence type movie, this may appeal.There is no doubt that Abrams is a genius but his inexperience in making big movies shows in this at times. I can't put a direct finger on exactly what it is but it just did not feel as well directed as the others.I agree with a previous reviewer, why are the directors being changed every time? It creates a discontinuity and the main characters don't seem themselves from 1-3."
3,action? cool. too long?YES. Boring? yes.,"M:I:3 is real good the first time you see it, the action is cool, bad guy is one of the most convincing I have seen since Commudos in Gladiator. Tom cruise is a horrible actor, the movie has way too much action and no story. Bassically, the whole works are unbalanced. Overall I think Phillip symour Hoffman steals the show as villain Owen Davian. The action is real good though, real good."
3,Plot =1 Effects=5,"With this MI movie, all similarity to the original series has been offically lost.Sure the effects were 5 star rating.But the basic story and plot was a 0-1.In this movie, the MI crew basically find the hard and complex way to do simple things like grab a large scale arms dealer.Of course the movie loses 1-2 stars right off the bat for the simple reason that WE HATE MOVIES THAT SHOW THE ENDING FIRST, then flash back to show you how things led up to this conclusion...... HATE THAT !!!!Often we just eject movies at that point....after all... who cares about the steps along the way once you know the conclusion.This movie could have been a 3rd installment of the Bourne Identity and nobody would have known the difference as it does not have the ""Mission Impossible feel"" at all.Fair entertainment but quickly forgetable"
3,"I can suspend my disbelief some, but....","I really enjoyed the movie. It easily carries on the tradition of the previous Missions Impossible for excitement and action. The storyline did carry a couple of nice twists, I will admit.I did have a whole bunch of trouble with the end where the new wife receives a thirty second familiariztion with a handgun, sees her hubby acutely in arrest and STILL exchanges rapid, remarkably accurate gunfire with professionals. No attempt to make it look like she got a couple of lucky breaks here, she blows the bad guys away. I was kind of buying right up to that point.Excellent flick, I'm going to get the DVD, but I'm still going to cringe at that."
3,Mission: Typical,"Mission: Impossible III is definitely for Tom Cruise fans, with plenty of captions such as ""Berlin, Germany,"" and ""Rome, Italy."" The rest of us, who already know a bit of geography, can skip it. The story has nothing new or unpredictable - in fact they show a scene from the end of the movie at the beginning, so you know exactly where it's going. The bad guys gathering in the Vatican, and the ""good"" guys breaking in to it, is an insulting implication to catholics. That's all my criticism; on the plus side the movie is a diversion with action, special effects, stunts, and explosions enough to keep it going and earn 3 stars. But personally I'd be just as satisfied to go see a new theatrical release of some of the old TV episodes with Peter Graves, which would save a fortune and probably present a more intellligent story."
5,Better than any version,MI 3 is the best of them all. The locations and the stunts are better than any other versions. Period.
4,Mission Impossible 3 (HD-DVD),I'm a fan of Mission Impossible movies. I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
4,Surprised I liked it so much!,Really fun special effects -- especially the very tall building he climbed on. I actually felt dizzy! Lots of it was predictable and very fun to watch.
2,Had to watch twice to remember it,"Had to watch twice to remember it,same stuff as the last movie. If your into to mindless this is ok."
4,Excellent action movie - but don't think about it too much!,"Brilliant performances by Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman plus excellent, non-cliched action sequences lift this above the average action movie. Throws credibility out the window but moves so fast you wont mind too much. Easily the best entry in the Mission Impossible franchise."
5,MI 3,"Didn't realize I had ordered the widescreen version but other than that, love this movie, especially the lamborghini murcialago!"
1,Not happy with provider,"I never received the product. After a week of it's delivery date, I notified the provider. The provider said that they didn't have any of the product and refunded my card. It's nice to get a refund but if they didn't have in stock why have it for sale?"
2,Where's the story?,Bottom line; a lot of elaborate and exaggerated action sequences tied together by an extremely weak story.
1,bad bad bad ... worse,"wow....im surprised so many reviewers were kind to this movie !...it is straight up terrible....looks like a big fat fox/abc TV show...JJ might have TV majic, but my Mom could direct a better movie...cruise is cruise....the rest of the cast is there to make him look tall and not nuts....if you like silly movies like ""face off"" or ""the rock"" or any 1980 swayze and/or stallone....you will love it"
2,Where's the plot,"I admit I was excited about the movie. Number one was a classic, number two was a waste of time and number three looked like another Tom Cruise classic; however at the end of the movie I was still waiting for a plot. Tom Cruise never really had an objective of the movie and also all of the ""bad guys"" weren't really pointed out in the movie. The movie was just things blowing up, fake technology that is even impossible in the future (i'm a chemical engineer can one really be ID by their vascular arteries). Even though I'm back at home I'm still waiting for a plot...or atleast a badly organized plot, some type of objective. I would say see the movie just to confirm that there was no plot and that Tom Cruise shouldn't produce and star in his own movies."
1,"WITLESS, DERIVATIVE AND GRIM","Not for a moment did I suspend disbelief at this meaningless spectacle of mayhem and contrived superficial emotion interspersed with loud, over-the-top action set pieces.By paying to see this movie, I felt guilty supporting an increasingly bizarre and crazy man's delusional, controlling behaviour. Yes, I'm talking about Tom Cruise. I heard other movie goers expressing the same thoughts. So I'm not alone.My gut feeling is that some of the Amazon reviewers who praised this movie are Paramount plants. Even my 12 year old son thought the movie was ""boring"" and he laughed when he heard the familiar notes of the Mission Impossible theme. He said he couldn't ""take it seriously and the plot was ridiculous."" So if this wasn't made for 12 year old boys, who was it made for? Not young adults, that's for sure."
1,Disk extra protected,"This disk does not play in multizone-multisystem player, it is extra protected somehow. So people outside US beware and don'y buy it here."
4,CRUISE CONTROL,"Definitely the best of the three, this one is at least a bit credible. I thought Phillip Seymore Hoffman made a good sociopath, frankly I wish he had been in it more. This movie is definitely action packed, it's exhaustively so, actually. I really not a big fan of these Mission movies, they are not nearly as good as the Bourne films, but this one kept me interested and I didnt find myself rolling my eyes as much as I had in the other two Mission movies. I appreciated that they gave Ethan a genuine love interest, and I liked how much of the movie was in flashback, that made it more riviting. After the second Mission movie I was not looking forward to another, but after seeing this, I'd definitely see another. Like I stated earlier, this is hardly up to any of the great Bourne movies, but without a question worth a viewing."
5,Great Cruise,"I love the movie. usually, I dislike action movies, but Cruise put so much of himself in it, I wondered and I get to check it.Brilliant, excellent. Cruise and Hoffman are both spectacular, espacially Cruise in the stunts and and on a comic side. He showed another side of his craft.JJ Abrams can do whatever he wants in Hollywood now, he is a royalty.As much as I like Alias, this is definitly a far superiro material here.The score , the music, the suspense, everything was great!Enjoy!"
4,Not the best,"The series has a big drop off from 2 to 3. Hoffman is a poor choice for a villain. He just never had enough menace for me. Action sequences unremarkable. Still, not a bad way to kill some time"
4,Great Action Movie...Cruise at his Best!!,"I enjoyed watching this Great Action Thriller on my Mini-I-Pad while in Bed last night....Lots of action, another great Tom Cruise Movie...."
4,Fun Movie,"2 Hours of Harmless Entertainment! If you're looking for a fun action flick, this is it! It's classic Tom Cruise. Enjoy!"
3,It's exciting but stupid,"It's like James Bond, all these things happen and most of them are impossible. It's fast paced and exciting. It's also very dark emotionally and not kid friendly at all, even young teens. But I just get burned out on movies that show things are are ridiculous and this one is completely full of those. 3 stars for Cruise doing many of his own stunts, at least a lot of the action stuff. He obviously worked hard on this."
2,Adrenalin the hard way,"Nothing goes right for the whole movie until the last couple of minutes. By then I didn't care what happens to the bad guy or why. And the explanation of the ""rabbit foot"" is anti-climactic on purpose, like a joke on the viewer. I had to put on another movie just to remember that movies are not about all frustration all the time."
4,CLIFF HANGER - LITERALLY!,"At times you'll be on the edge of your seat, other times you'll tear the seat cushion (and your hands will never leave your popcorn and soda).Tom Cruise pulls off some great movies, with some great acting - and this movie is one of 'em.This easily tops the likes of Top Gun, and runs neck and neck (edging) his NASCAR movie.I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a testosterone packed guy flick, and I recommend bringing your lady friend, because she'll enjoy it too.I can't imagine how Tom Cruise got up the stones to dangle from such a tall building (during filming) - must be a zen thing?The musical score was also good. Henry Mancini would be proud.P.S. The burning fuse at the beginning was reminiscent of the television series - nice touch!"
1,Movie stoppage,Nothing is more frustrating than watching a movie and having it stop three quarters through. In order to see the whole movie we had to skip a small section to continue. If it happens again we will never use Amazon again for movies!
3,Not much difference in normal DVD and this Blu-Ray version,"I've seen this movie many times on a regular DVD, I like the movie so i bought this Blu-Ray version also. But was surprised to see there isnt much difference in normal DVD and HD Blu-Ray. I own some other Blu-Ray releases too and this one goes in the last position now.I've given this 2 stars coz its still a good transfer if you havent seen the movie in DVD yet."
4,Edge of Your Seat Adventure...,"This adrenaline pumping movie keeps you on the edge of seat. Lots of action, quick paced scenes, and of course, high-tech gadgets galore!!Good acting and storyline! Romance is on the menu for Ethan Hunt this time around as he marries the woman of his dreams!!With J.J. Abrams at the helm as director, you definitely see/feel the ""Alias"" vibe."
4,More twists than a bowl of spaghetti...,"This could be the best of the Mission Impossible franchise so far. Certainly it's better than MI-2 and, at least, equal to MI-1. Lots of explosive international high tech action, gadgets, great locations in Germany, Rome and surprising Shanghai, beautiful female stars and more twists than a bowl of spaghetti. Everything we've come to expect from the MI team. And they leave the door open for MI-4!"
3,MI3,"MI3 was not as good as I was expecting it to be. But it was still really good. Tom Cruise and Phillip Seymoure Hoffman were EXCELLENT in this film. The action was spectacular and the storyline was good. I loved the scene where Tom gets thrown into the car by that massive explosion. That is what would really happen to someone after an explosion like that, they wouldn't just walk away from it. That was a very realistic scene. I admit that it is one of the best films so far this year."
4,Mi:III,"Mission Impossible III has all the kinetic energy prerequisite of any summer action flick. Tom Cruise, doing many of his own stunts, is also magnanimous in his return as Ethan Hunt. Yes, the plot offers the impossible mission of bringing any semblance of plausability for the viewer. Nonetheless, one is captivated by the stunts, particularly the swing across Shagnai towers and the subsequent parachute down. In a change from its two predecessors, there is a little romance intermittently placed for pace. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a great villain, although his screen time is appropiated sparsely. Finally, one of the best scenes is when Hunt breaks into the Vatican - it is beautifully filmed and cleverly done. I reccomend the movie. Of the three Mission Impossibles, I enjoyed this one the most."
3,Good action...bad script,"I was one of those people who resisted this film last year because Mr. Cruise was severely riding my last nerve. But apparently I didn't stay away for long. I agree that the action and special effects are good. However, the script stinks to high heaven. And camera hogging Cruise needs to learn how to share the camera. Even our villian, Hoffman's character, had the smallest amount of screen time I've ever seen. Hunt and his ""wife"" have absolutely no chemistry and I didn't buy into the love affair and I don't appreciate not being told what the heck the rabbit's foot was and what it was capable of doing. Overall, if you're just looking for good action scenes this is the movie for you. If you're looking something else--look somewhere else."
3,running out of good ideas,I was disappointed with this movie.Having viewed the previous offerings... I was hoping for the same or betterSure there was lots of Tom Cruise adrenaline-pumping action... but the story lineand plot were somewhat disappointing.Lets hope somebody can dream up a better script next time...Its not like I want to get rid of the movie... it's not that bad.but compared to earlier MI offerings it seemed a bit lame
3,Entertaining movie fare,"I was pleasantly surprised at MI3. In spite of all the Tom Cruise hoopla this film gives you your money's two hours worth entertainment.Although Cruise is the star Philip S. Hoffman really steals the show with his portrayal of an exceptionally evil villain. The director keeps the pace moving along quickly with only a few moments of pause. Like the other MI movies special effects play a major role and gets delivered in healthy doses.It's no secret the movie is a formulaic hollywood summer season opener, but it's good at what it does and delivers up a solid two hours of entertainment. That said there's really nothing new going on and while Cruise delivers a solid performance it's really just the action and Hoffman who make the movie the most watchable. Worth an afternoon at the movies but you could probably pass on the dvd once you've seen it."
3,Great special effects,"The scene on the bridge is the best for the special effects.I thought the actor who won the oscar for Capote was a bad choice for the bad guy in this film. He was scary in the scene when he had a gun to Tom Cruise's wife though. Other than that he was not a good pick for the bad guy.This film overall was ok. The beginning was boring, but the ending wasent bad. Definetly better than Mission Impossible 2. The 2nd one I did not like. It was more of a love story than anything else to me. The first Mission Impossible had some decent moments but wasent great. The 3rd Mission Impossible was the best of the 3 but it was still ok, not spectacular.Rent dont buy is my opinion, I bought this film already though! But it was only $8.98 at Target.Nicole M*"
4,Amazing HD-DVD experience!,"This movie is an HD-DVD experience! If you love how films are made, checking out the HD-DVD version is a must!This is the second HD-DVD I've watched, and Picture-in-Picture video commentary is like nothing you've seen before. Unlike regular DVD and Blu-Ray audio commentary, you watch the film along with Tom Cruise and JJ Abrams as they watch the film too. When they want to talk in detail about a scene, they pause the movie! And their commentary video continues! Absolutely amazing. They will talk about alternate takes and deleted scenes and you can immediately view them right there by clicking a button (you don't have to pop in the second extras disc to see deleted scenes). Seeing these creative pros talk to each other adds so much more than just a normal commentary audio track. You can see the excitement and the energy they put into their work. Also, the extras second disc is all in HD too. The extras are so good, it makes up for whatever weaknesses the actual movie has."
2,Rent rather than purchase,"This was a big disappointment, it was so slow I fell asleep 1/2 way thru. I thought I'd purchase it to go with the first 2 Mission Impossibles but this wasn't as good as either one of them.Save your money and rent this first before purchasing it like I did."
4,A great book to read!,Ingeborg is a courageous young woman. Even though she lost her husband she eventually come back to God. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about courage and strength. Way to go Lauraine!
3,Compelling characters but unsatisfactory ending,"Two Norwegian immigrant families travel to Dakota Territory to homestead farms and face hardships and tragedy that challenge their faith in God.This book kept me reading but I'm not sure why. The story itself was wandering and unfocused although it showed how hard life was for the homesteaders. The characters were pretty much one-dimensional but Ingeborg and Kaaren were likable and I wanted to know what was going to happen next. It almost felt like the Mitford series and would be worth trying for readers who liked those stories. The limp, unbelievable ending was a serious drawback. Snelling rushed through several significant events in the epilogue and Ingeborg's change of heart did not ring true. I enjoyed the first 3/4 enough that I'll probably try the next book in the series, but I did not leave satisfied."
5,Best burning software out there!,"I have tried many programs to burn DVDs and have found this one to be the most reliable and easy to use. It's a bit expensive compared to other software, but it is well worth the cost."
4,Good but a little weird,I liked this book because Mandie learned a lesson she really needed to learn and she helped people along the way (like she always does). I think that Rupert is an absolute snob. I also liked the adventure it got pretty suspenseful. Celia should learn how to stand up for herself and say her opinion instead of just following Mandie and Jonathon. All in all I thought this book was good but I thought the jumping tree was a little weird and lame.
5,One of the Better Matrix Books,"This anthology does a great job pulling interesting commentary on the movie together. In some ways it's more enjoyable than the movie itself. It has something of a religious bias, but so did the movie. Recommended if you're in the mood for deep thought lite."
3,Short on Social/Political Commentary,"I enjoyed this book. But honestly it could have been better. ""The Matrix"" is a striking film--in my opinion one of the best movies of the decade. To me, the most gripping thing about the movie is the implicit parallel between the unreality of the parasite-controlled Matrix and the commercially-shaped Matrix of our American culture. What the average joe experiences as reality is a false world. It's a created set of impressions that don't match reality very closely, but do serve the commercial interests that foster them. Like the movie Matrix, the parasitic ""matrix"" of our time exploits us. It extracts our money, time, and energy to its own ends. The essays in this book were good. But the editor seemed to sidestep any serious commercial or political issues. Maybe he was hesitant to take them on. Or maybe he just didn't get it."
5,Understanding The Matrix,"The book arrived within the deadline and in excellent condition. As far as this complex subjet is concerned, it is discussed from different interesting viewpoints and with an accessible language. I have enjoyed the reading very much and now I understand the movie better."
4,Taking the Red Pill,"This book poses some interesting ideas and theories. Some of the essays are linked to the film and others are inspired by themes the film explores. I found most of the essays to be well written and have something of interest to say, a minority were not of much interest, a little tenuous or of minor relevance. Never the less, it is worth a read for some of the forward looking ideas explored in it's pages.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Philosophy and the Matrix...,"Enjoy the science and philosophy of the first Matrix movie with such greats as Robert J. Sawyer, David Gerrold, and Ray Kurzweil. Chapters on machine intelligence, ethics, and our future. Truly fun and mind expanding if a tad outdated now that the other movies are out.So, which pill would you take?"
3,Good and Bad,"This is actually a hard book to review because of the essays beign written by many authors. Basically I give this a three because it does not go into great depth. If you have thought about the Matrix while watching you more than likely have an opinion and thoughts on the subjects they write about, for example - Was Cypher right in wanting to be plugged back in? The good part of this book though is that it is a great introduction to some philosophical concepts if one hasn't taken an intro to philosophy course. It does give the background on where the ideas for this movie came from. If you really like this one or don't like it for that matter read The Matrix and Philosophy. This is a good read that goes into a little more depth than this book seems to do. Although everything I have said is not positive I do not want to discourage you from reading this book."
5,Brilliant book,"The book I have is the 3d Ed, which is greatly improved (Mathematica code is left at the end of each chapter and one could download all program files from the publisher's website). Together with much better clarity of presentation, this extended edition gives excellent overview of various topics supported by more than 300 illustrations that help to develope the intuitive feel for geometry in general. I would highly recommend this book for students who needs a comprehensive approach with lots of examples one could try out using Mathematica. Learning new concepts and visualizing them with Mathematica is great fun! The beauty of geometry is more accessible than ever before."
5,DA BEST SOCCER SHOE,"This is the best soccer shoe I have ever worn. Lightweight, comfortable, provides great ball handling and turf contact. Here is a little caveat, though- when buying this shoe, try to get 1 size smaller than your actual size-it will stretch (thanks to Kangaroo leather) and will be a perfect fit!"
2,No Way!,"I got this thinking how great it would be for the many bulbs I decide to plant each fall. How fun and easy! Yes, maybe if you are a 180 pound man. Even with that in mind, your soil still has to be really 'nice' soil for this tool to get down into it the full length. This was for naturalizing, not soft garden soil. I weigh 100 lbs. This did not work for me at all. I used it to help get holes started, but that's it. Also, the edge should have been much more thin, like a good shovel, its edge is too thick to go in easily. Not worth the money."
3,"Super sturdy, large diameter: I prefer Yardworks from Mendards","I love that this auger is very solid, one piece and has a large diameter but I found it was much harder to push in than my Yardworks model from Menards. I put 300+ bulbs into a mulched and rocky bed in my front yard. I weigh over 200 lbs and have years of experience stepping and jumping on my Yardworks (which is two pieces and not nearly as sturdy.) This would be great if you had large bulbs and a very soft soil bed.Cheers!"
5,GTX Dope spitta $$$$$$$$,This is one of the throwedest album that came out lately trust me it go hard.I be jamming out on 1& 2.
2,Healing Power of Gemstones,It wasn't what I was expecting or what I wanted. I just skimmed through the first 80% of the book which to me was superfluous information. I just wanted to know about how to apply the healing power of gemstones. For me it just wasn't there. I wanted what gem should be worn where to accomplish certain goals but that was not covered. I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for that information.
2,Does not fit all Recipe Organizers!,"Note: This DOES NOT fit the C.R. Gibson Bon Appetit Recipe Organizer, 4 x 6-Inch C.R. Gibson. It is much too small. The product description states that it will fit but that is not accurate."
4,great!,"This fit my recipe book perfect, with 4 by 6 cards! It's great to be able to add to my recipes!"
5,Match the recipe book perfectly.,"I go my nana the recipe book, additional recipe index cards, and these for more recipe refills. She loved them all!"
1,nothing new here,In a word - terrible. There is really no new material on this CD. It's all hype and no substance. The jokes are all old and not funny. It gets very annoying listening to Martling laugh at himself over and over again before he can even get the joke out. He screams every one of his jokes on this album and it gave me a headache. I'm glad I didn't pay anything for my copy of this CD because it was given to me as a gag gift. If you like torturing yourself and still want this CD you can probably pick it up for free in a trash can near you.
5,Best smoothie video ever!!!!!!!!!!,This was such a wonderful DVD!!!! I give it out to all my clients because it shows the tricks of making a GREAT tasting and healing smoothie. I would recommend this DVD to absolutely everyone who wants to become a green smoothie pro. What an informative food prep video this is. I haven't made a bad tasting smoothie since watching this film. Even my children like my smoothies now.
5,Great Info,"My family really enjoyed this dvd. Answered lots of questions about making smoothies. Like why ours sometimes turn out watery and frothy. And, why it could be bitter.More enjoyable to watch than if we were reading about it. I even tried some new fruits and ""weed greens"". With this new information we may just try making savory smoothies again, despite my not so great concoctions before.Don't let the small amount of recipies discourage you. I found the techniques and info on the recipies to be excellent, and more importantly it will help you make your own recipies better."
4,Something Different....,"Well, here is something different: A gay romance-thriller set on the American frontier in 1796. Sex, bad guys, more sex, Indians, more sex...a real page-turner, and nicely told, too. I can't wait to see what author Michael Jensen offers us next."
5,An extraordinary journey of mesmeric storytelling!,"Michael Jensen is gifted with the ability to paint vivid pictures with mere words. ""Frontiers"" captured me from the very beginning and didn't let go. I felt myself being swept back to another time and not eager to return. Thank you Michael for the experience!"
3,Frontiers,"I've been scratching my head wondering what I might say that would help the prospective buyer make a decision about this book.There is an interesting peek into what times were like for a young, gay, single settler staking a land claim during the westward expansion. What was difficult to grasp in this period piece was this young man coming in contact with three other gay men in the short time period the book covers. That was too much irony even for fiction.This book ends, in my opinion, near the point where it should have begun. There is no doubt there is a good story for a potential sequel.Thank you."
4,Let's See the Sequel!,"I enjoyed it very much, although at times I thought the verbage, internal and otherwise, a bit too contemporary. I was encouraged to read the book by a recommendation on a film star fan site, so naturally I read it with casting in mind. My recommendation: as John, British actor Rupert Graves (but definitely NOT Hugh Grant); as Gwennie, Anglo-Indian actress Rita Wolf; as Palmer, Heath Ledger; and as Daniel/Zach, Rufus Sewell."
5,The Best in Historical Fiction,"What a glorious find this book is! Although this novel is ""light,"" it is not without its virtues nor is it without serious thought, humanism, and a great deal of historical fact. If you like humor, it's here. If you like action, it's here. If you like historical figures brought to life, it's here. Jensen, a true artist, can write passages so poetic that the imagery transports your imagination into the Colonial American wilderness and holds you there. It may seem odd, but reading ""Frontiers"" gave me much the same reaction as the first time I saw the original ""Star Wars."" Good luck, Michael Jensen, may the ""force be with you"" to produce many more novels ahead."
5,The Best Book Available Dealing with Gay/Lesbian Issues,I am an avid reader and have read many gay/lesbian books but none that come close to what 'Frontiers' has to offer. This story is not a merely sexual experience but a very intriguing story with suspense and mystery that makes it a book that you cannot put down until the very end. When you have finished it you find yourself feeling like the characters are personal friends of yours' and want to keep in touch with their everyday adventures. I have to say that it is one of the best books I've read in sometime and I read at least 80 books a year. A MUST read
5,Excellent Novel!,I could not put this book down. The language and imagery of this novel is wonderful!
5,The Best of the Year,"After reading some truly ghastly award winning literature (whose idea was it to give the Nobel Prize in Literature to Jose Saramago anyway?), ""Frontiers"" was given to me as a birthday gift. Amazing work, Mr. Jensen. When the public finds you, and they will, be ready for celebrity. As so many have said here, this book has brilliant history, a creative approach to history, and something missing these days in literature: readability. God bless you, Michael Jensen for this treasure."
5,Excellen Excapist Entertainment,"Personally I've gotten tired of all the gay content books that deal heavily with 90's issues or aids or that try to hard to be an important book. That's why I loved this book! There are no over riding issues in this one. However it is dramatic enough to pull you into it's lanscape. It grabbed my attention from the first chapter and held it all the way to the end. With the way John Chapman was written as the settler with no settler skills, it provided me chance to imagine myself in John's shoes and learning about what it would be like to be a settler - at least in spirit. I thank Mr. Jensen for taking me away from the real world for a couple of days. I just wish the book had been longer."
1,A major disappointment,"I read this book before I saw all the reviews here and I'm wondering if we're all talking about the same novel. The one I read was formulaic and totally unremarkable. Compared to some really excellent novels set on the frontier and featuring gay characters (The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon or The Rest of the Earth), Frontiers is pretty lame--lowest common denominator fiction, written as if it wanted to be a screenplay. I never believed for a second that these characters lived in the 1700s, what with all the late 20th century pop psychology running through the narration. Within 20 pages of the end, I simply stopped reading. I was so bored with the characters and knew exactly what would happen next. If you like contrived, anachronistic historical fiction with tons of gratuitous sex and violence, then Frontiers might be right up your alley."
2,Gay Historical Fiction,"Readers buy novels for many reasons, and an insight into real individuals is rare. This historical fiction I found to be a good read. The real ""Johnny Appleseed"" probably was as backward as the John Chapman of ""Frontiers"", and one senses the outcast nature of being an ""abomination"" in the 1790s. The author does a masterful job with the difficulty of John's sexual difference as well as the hardship of living on the frontier. There is no positive sense of closure with the novel, just as there probably was with the real John Chapman's life. I enjoyed it!"
1,I really wanted to like this book.....,"but I didn't! I read this book after the author contacted me. He had read my Amazon review of John Rechys' CITY OF NIGHT and wanted me to read his book also. Of course, I was honored. I really found it difficult to believe anything in this book. And oh, how I tried. It's supposed to be a period piece. But, the voices of the characters are like they are alive in our time rather than 200+ years ago. I was really very hungry for something I thought it was going to be. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. Of course, this is just my opinion. Thank you for reading my review."
2,Not very good,"I realize there's always a need for gay-positive novels. But unfortunately, this is merely a silly, shallow gay-themed Harlequin romance. It's ineptly written, the characters are poorly drawn and even the ""historical"" aspects have been better covered by other authors. Sure, it will mindlessly kill a couple of hours. But you'd be better off -- and better entertained -- discovering more innovative authors."
3,Man-to-man (rawhide) bodice ripper...not much more,"I found this book frustrating. I had hoped it would fulfill its premise that John Chapman (the historical ""Johnny Appleseed"") was gay. While Jensen's John Chapman is gay and does plant a grove of apple trees, the book turns into a (albeit sweet and even credible) romantic novel about Chapman's (sexual and other) adventures in western Pennsylvania in the 1790s. The characters are a bit one-dimensional and I did find myself wondering at some possibly anachronistic usages (""truck farm""?). I do agree with the reviewer who expressed pleasure at the availability of gay romantic charcters and plots, but this book left me wishing for more substance. Maybe Mr. Jensen plans a sequel, in which Johnny Appleseed heads out to fulfill his folkloric destiny, accompanied by the man of his dreams. The conclusion of this book does allow that option, by the way...."
1,Save your money . . . buy better!,"Though I've never read a Harlequin romance, I imagine that they must read much like Mr. Jensen's ""Frontiers."" I feel misled by the early hype. The experience of gay men and women in the early American period is ripe for exploration. Unfortunately, Mr. Jensen was not up to the task. There are many well written books by gay authors out there . . . read those. Skip this one!"
2,An Unbalanced Movie,"When I first watched this movie years ago on A&E, I loved it. Now, having read the book twice, I realize that it is totally out of balance. The movie focuses on Anna and her affair and gives glancing attention to the growth of love between Levin and Kitty. As a result, the ""problem"" of love as shown by Anna has no strongly stated counter argument. And so, this version is not nearly even half the story."
4,A Moving Anna Karenina,"Sophie Marceau's ethereal beauty serves her well as beautiful, tragic Anna. She artfully depicts Anna's emotional fragility. I was very impressed by Vivienne Leigh's depiction but this a beautiful rendition in all ways. I particularly appreciate that it takes the time to let the watcher know of the role her ""sleeping medicine"" affected her decline. And also taking the time to let us share Levin's journey. I personally found Sean Bean falling short of the passionate Vronsky.Definetly a must for all lovers of Anna Karenina."
1,what a failure!,"This film is an awful collection of stereotypes, starting from the wolves on the snow as the opening scene following high society ladies drinking shots of vodka, etc etc.I found it ridiculous that all society people are talking English and all the simple folk - Russian. How awful!! Obviously, the director wanted to draw a line between the classes, but to do it so awkwardly... Yes, Russian high classes were used to mix their Russian speach with French, but there has never been such a total language barrier as the director tries to convince us.I was also surprised to see some good actors giving such totally wooden performances!I doubt the film gets any better towards the end, though I will never know that for I couldn't bring myself to watch it for long (even out of curiosity) as it pained me greatly to see one of the finest works of literature spoiled so heartlessly."
1,This is not real Anna Karenina.,"Not a bit. This is something completely different and completely awful.Why?The book written by count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy is brilliant masterpiece of Russian and world literature. This novel is really big. And no one can appropriately retell it. Especially if he has only 108 minutes of screen time.So this movie show us only some moments which were considered by authors the most important. And, of course, such gallop has nothing in common with the original. No idea. No style.The actors are pretty bad, screenplay is awful, the movie is kind of waste.If U will have ability to watch this movie - dont do it."
5,Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina,"The movie does not follow the book exactly, but it was wonderfully made. I find it highly entertaining. I think that Tolstoy would enjoy this movie."
5,"Gorgeous Scenery, Lovely Marceau","The first version of Anna Karenina I have ever seen prompted me to see other portrayals. Sophie Marceau was exquisite. Sean Bean was tolerable, but did not compare to the heroine. The costume design was gorgeous, as were the shots of Russia. When Russia sometimes is made out to be a bleak and bad place, this film makes it look like a lovely place."
3,Not like the book,"This film has lavish production values. However, it is simply too short to convey the nuances of the novel, and the plot has been altered enough to disturb the novel's devotees. Probably this is why I was unable to become deeply involved with the characters. I was also disturbed by the actress cast for Kitty, a character who in the novel stands for conventional female purity. In the film Kitty has husky, sensual speech and usually appears with a push-up bra that spills her out of a low neckline. The actor who portrays Count Vronsky is so wooden you can't understand why Anna would ruin her life for him. And, I can't understand the apparently random alternation of English speech with Russian plus subtitles. Watch this film for the costumes and sets, not the story."
3,Highly Disappointed,"I watched this movie for 2 reasons, Sean Bean and Bernard Rose. Rose's direction of Immortal Beloved was masterful, and I was hoping to find the same here. I was left feeling disappointed. Although the sets, costumes and music were beautiful, this movie did not live up to its potential.Sean Bean, a very talented actor, was put in a choke-hold by the script. He is capable of far more passion than this screenplay allowed. Fortunately, I had seen Sophie Marceau prior to this movie, so I know that she is far more capable as well. I don't think I've ever seen such poor chemistry between two key actors in such a tragic tale. With the exception of the ballroom scene this movie was flat. Pity...it could have been so much more.The three stars I'm giving are based on costumes, sets, music and the mere presence of Sean Bean."
4,Splendor & tragedy.,"The initial scene with Molina caught between a pack of wolves and a bear in a pit, really horrors us. At this anguish moment, his memory about the events of his live tells us his story. He introduces in the upper class Tzar society of the initial 20th century Russia. Molina marries a rich maiden, whose love for him was doubtful. Anna is part of this opulent class, and takes part of the palace parties, whose splendor is the greatest part of the film. Her love for the military man takes her away from her husband and son. The final and tragic moment, in this version seems as a mannequin thrown in the rails. This scene really is a disappointment. Back to Molina, the scene in the pit does not conclude in the film. We suppose he has been eaten by the bear when he falls down, if we are negative, or if we are positive he had survive when someone shoot at the wolves and rescue him."
2,"Beautifully shot, inadequately scripted and acted","I so wanted to enjoy this movie. A classic Tolstoy novel and a beautiful, enchanting Marceau in the title role. Much as I tried, however, the same thought ""Who cares"" rang home with me throughout the movie. I am committed to read the book now, in hopes of redeeming my perceptions of Tolstoy's greatness.Can anyone tell me how I'm to connect the initial scene with Molina caught between a pack of wolves and a bear, with the rest of the movie? Is it prologue? Epilogue? Metaphor? I am at a total loss. Perhaps Tolstoy's novel will enlighten me..."
3,Karenina a Big Disappointment,The story was a gloss over and left me feeling the characters were one dimensional. Sophie Marceau was excellent but the story needed more screen time to tell it fully.
2,slow passionless Anna,"Slow, passionless, pointless production of a complicated masterpiece. No fire. No passion. Boring. and even worse: trying watching it without knowing who it is or what it is about!! Clueless."
4,Review,"I am a Sean Bean fan, and I found this movie was very well acted by both Sean Bean and Sophie Marceau. I think that if you have not read the book this movie is okay to watch. Some parts were rather boring (not the ones with Sean Bean of course :). Other than that it's an okay movie if your a romantic."
2,Wooden acting. Marceau as Anna is NOT in love. No wonder.,I was disappointed in the main characters in this movie. Marceau was not convincing in her love- sick portrayal of Anna. She is a beautiful woman with great acting potential but the chemistry with Bean was understandably nonexistent. He was very wooden/passionless and terribly miscast as Vronsky
3,"It's not the book,but it's one sumptuous movie!!!","Tolstoy cannot be distilled into less than two hours,but the music of Tchaikowsky,Prokofiev and Rachmaninoff coupled with lavish costumes and on location shots in St.Petersburg made this an immense viewing pleasure.The production was very much on the scale of AMADEUS.Director/Screenplay writer took much liberty with Tolstoy's ponderous novel and made a lush presentation showcasing the sounds and scenes of Czarist Russia.The camera work and lighting are first rate.These are some of the films numerous strengths in contrast to the condensed version of the book! This film has much to offer to those who have not read the book.The high points are hit.It should leave viewers the desire to know more of Tolstoy's writings and of Russian history.Again,the Georg Solti conducted soundtrack is worth a watching alone!!!"
4,With a surprise ending,A return to what Doig does best; weave lush scenery from the people and places of the harsh dry farming country of eastern Montana. The description of how Morrie finds and sustains the fire for learning in Paul and the entire class is something that we all can use. The ending is somewhat of a surprise and sets the reader up to look for the continuation of the story hopefully in his next book.
4,Book Club Selection,"This book was one of those that I wouldn't have chosen to read on my own, but I'm glad I read. I joined the book club to read books that are out of my usual selection list. The writing sometimes threw me. He tends to write sentences that aren't really sentences. But I really liked the vivid picture he paints of the time and place. Like the characters a lot. The plot line telegraphed itself very early on. Lots of points for club discussion. It rated a 4.5 out of 5 from the club."
4,'The Whistling Season',I like Doig's writing style. Very calm but holds your attention. The one room school was interesting.Am planning to buy The Bartender's Tales.
4,American Coming of Age: Lovely Writing,"I loved the characters and, sometimes, the writing was so good it made me stop to admire the craft. I couldn't give it 5 stars because there were times I felt it got a little slow, but as a coming of age novel, it was sweet, tense, funny and humane. A good read, especially for anyone who enjoys books set in the West."
4,Prairie Life n the Old School House,"Great story, difficult to read at times. Author is a fantastic writer but can be be verbose. However good opportunity to increase my vocabulaty:-) This is a story of a family trying to find their way after a tragedy;heart warming."
4,Whistling Season,"This was my first reading of one of Ivan Doig books. I liked his humorous style of writing this as it helped visualize the characters,It was a good story that gave feelings and hope for the the people of the prairie.My objection to the Amazon version is that the editing was not good and mistyped words coming up too often."
1,One of my TOP WORST READS!!!,"This was a book club choice to read and I must say that only 3 of 13 of us even finished the book. The era isn't one of particular interest to me, however I hung strong until the very end anxiously WAITING for the climax of the novel. The twist didn't come until almost the very end of the book. This book was so piecemeal, I was truly difficult to tie many nonrelevant events to the ""story"". Don't waste your time - I wish I could get mine back!"
4,I liked it so much more than I expected to!,"Lyrically written, I really enjoyed this book's cadence and characters. Normally, I prefer more plot-driven books, and I don't have any particular fondness for Montana or the West in general, but there was just something inexplicably wonderful about this book. I really had a great time reading it! It did remind me a bit of Leif Enger's books, so I think that anyone who enjoyed his works, would enjoy this one as well!"
5,Pure Pleasure and Amazing Story Telling,"I have read the reviews and concur with all of the praise. Ignore the few low rated reviews! This book does have everything ~ heart, humor, plot, interest, and so on. It is beautifully written and each sentence and character developed into a plot that unfolds like a rich velvet blanket."
4,Read this Book!,"Ivan Doig must be the Midwest's answer to Stegner...well written, engaging, great characters that reveal just enough (unlike our People Mag oriented society). One of those books I am so glad to have read and will recommend. Also enjoyed the historical perspective of the United States at that time of one room school houses, etc."
5,Ivan Doig takes a new tack,"I was fortunate to see Ivan Doig at a book reading for Whistling Season. Certainly he draws upon his real life experience at a one room school and with a father widowed with young children. However, I think that in this new book, he goes beyond his real life experience (at least as described in his biographies, House of Sky and Heart Earth) to create a fictional environment. This new tack is, in my opinion, a good one, and I found this a very enjoyable book."
5,"wonderful, original story","One of the best ""coming-of-age"" stories I've ever read.Truly touching....you feel for these characters and come to knowthem, AND there is a bit of a mystery and secrets to be discovered within, whichDoig hints at and reveals perfectly! Very well-written!"
1,Whistling Season,"The Kindle edition was very poorly transcribed. There were so many misspellings that it became a real distraction while reading. I enjoy reading on my Kindle but I felt cheated on this book. The story is great, just don't get it on your Kindle."
4,Education in Montana,"It took a little while to get into the story. Time frame and characters seemed a little fuzzy at first. Once it got to the school system and later that the narrator had become in later life a school administrator things were more clear. The characters were very interesting once into the story! You don't know where ""The Whistling Season"" comes from until near the end of the book."
1,A Trifle from Ivan,"Ivan Doig has always been one of my favorite authors, but I don't know what happened here. A short story perhaps, but the lack of narrative drive did not sustain any interest for me. The evocative, pastoral settings of time and place were sweet but not enough to bolster an incredibly threadbare plot. Certainly not one of his finest."
3,The Whistling Season,"Nice read - i.e. What's not to like? There wasn't any conflict, crisis or problem resolution. Just a nice read."
1,Good book; very poor conversion to Kindle,"This is not a review of the book/story. It is a review of the Kindle (Fire) Edition. The Edition is riddled with typos, punctuation errors, garbled paragraphs, random capitalizations, and so forth. For example, the name of a major character turns from Rose into Kose; another from Toby into Tobe; and so forth. Amazon gets an A for the Kindle concept; an F for execution and quality control."
5,"Wonderful, evocative work of art","Books like this don't come along often enough. I felt like I was reading something of my own life when reading The Whistling Season, although I didn't grow up in Montana and did not attend a one-room school. Doig is a word-smith like few others, able to create mental landscapes that have color, depth, and feel. His characters take form in his descriptions and by their words and acts, to the point they become a figure of one's past also."
3,"Beautiful writing, unrealistic environment","There's no doubt about it, Doig is a masterful writer, and in this book, he puts his vast knowledge of words to work in a challenging way for the reader. I could indeed picture the environment of the story (I happen to love Montana) and I rather enjoyed the characters. However, there's something too ""goody-goody"" about the scenario. It is set at an earlier time in the 20th century, yes, but read in today's world, it feels like a real stretch. So much so, that I was anxious to finish it toward the end. Enough goodness for me."
5,Great Coming of Age Story,This is one of the best coming of age stories I've read in years. Ivan Doig evokes a wonderfully strong image of the family as it deals with everyday life and all of the changes that occur.
2,"Great characters, labored writing","Doig has created a wonderful group of characters, but his writing made it impossible for me to read more than half of the book. I kept tripping over his prose, which is labored and overwritten. He is certainly a good storyteller. If he told the story simply and elegantly, I'd still be reading. Such a shame."
1,Doig is no Wallace Stegner,I bought Bucking the Sun out of the Bargain Bin a few years back. Here's another Doig title that I shouldn't have paid full price for. My bookmark is collecting dust between 138 and 139. There's just nothing to lure me back to the lifeless story or the boilerplate characters who seem to be cut and pasted on to the page. Maybe this story is going somewhere. I'm just not sure I want to be there when it does.
3,A quiet tale -- amusing and heartfelt,"I was quite charmed by this book, which has a now wrapper around a then story. The now wrapper is a Montana education official tasked with determining the fate of one of the state's last one-room schoolhouses. The then story is the official's recollection of his thirteenth year, when he attended just such a school in eastern Montana. Paul Milliron is one of three brothers whose recently-widowed father has advertised back east for a housekeeper and ends up hiring Rose who acknowledges in her letter of application that she ""can't cook but doesn't bite."" She arrives with her brother in tow, a curious kind of scholar who ends up taking over the school teacher duties, much to the delight and betterment of Paul. Doig masterfully evokes time and place, and his tale, though quiet, is both amusing and heartfelt."
2,whistling season,"It was an okay book, not quite my favorite. It could be a Disney movie, that's for sure! 2 stars."
2,Didn't seem to help my condition,For me did not notice much improvement in the stated exercises but I have been dealing with back pain for 5 years.
5,3 minutes pain free for life,"3 Minutes pain free for life is exactly what it says, it took me less than three minutes to see what kind of excercise I needed to do to help out my problem. It has easy to follow intructions and a good read."
5,Fantastic book arrived quickly,Amazon has done it again! Your sellers are prompt and efficient. 4 Minutes to Pain Free is a wonderful book and I was pleased to receive it so promptly so I could get started with this program. Thanks for such good service!
2,Anatomy + Phyical therapy,"First of all... exercises can not relieve the pain in 3 minute period... and as the book mentions that the most important this is prevention... that means working for years before your get the relief...It is k book but the title is misleading. The title implies (at least to me) that there are some real (sort of psycho - hypnotically)pain management techniques. But instead the book just provides with anatomy and exercises to MAINTAIN the body and PREVENT from issues to happen.I do yoga for years and have a medical degree, so this book has no use to me."
3,Exercises Great...Skip the Food Advice,The body specific exercises are really good. So far I have only picked and chosen among them all for ones I could use right away. They are well explained and easy to do one by one. The hip one has really helped a lot since I am avoiding a hip replacement. I plan to do the whole program just to see how it works. The food advice is just too far away from my proven way of eating according to Weston A. Price principles so I only give this book 3 stars. Weisberg should have stayed away from diet because his body care exercise information is so good.
5,3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life,Use information as directed and you indeed have your own Program for total body pain PREVENTION and RAPID RELIEF. Anyone any age can use this to their benefit. Great alternative to prescriptions and certainly more healthy. Just be patient with yourself.....this does help you to improve and stay that way..get off your butt and get movin' and stay movin' for LIFE!
5,Most comfortable walking shoes,"These are the most comfortable walking shoes I have ever tried! Even with foot problems (bunion, bone spur, arthritis) I can walk for hours in these shoes without pain. They have a good arch and a roomy toe box. I love them and won't stop wearing them until they stop making them!"
3,Brooks Women's Addiction 7 Running Shoe,"The subject running shoe fit fine and feel comfortable, however the left shoe makes a squaking sound on every step and is annoying to those who hear it, especially the person who is wearing the shoes. In an attempt to get rid of the sound, a foot powder was put in the shoe, but the noise didn't go away."
5,Super comfortable and durable running shoe!,"A year ago I went to Fleet Feet and got fitted for the Addiction 8 shoes. I loved them and logged over 300 miles on them, mostly trail running. I was trying to save some $$ so I started searching for them on amazon and found these. I like the colors better on the Addiction 7's and the shoe feels exactly as great as the 8's. They are perfect for those of us who overpronate and need help keeping our feet level and straight while we run. I love these shoes!!!"
1,Shoes did not run true to size,These shoes were much too big. I always wear a 8.5 or a 9 in running shoes. These were more than a half size too big for me and I returned them.
3,"Pretty pictures, not much substance","This is a really beautiful book, but if what you are looking for is a comprehensive selection of pictures detailing every aspect of an outdoor wedding, this isn't it. The book looks at about 12 weddings, and (by and large) has one picture of the ceremony, one of the bride, and a couple others that look at smaller details (the bouquet, or the favors). I was hoping for larger pictures of every reception and ceremony from a number of angles, as well as explanations on how to do everything. This book does have tips on executing an outdoor wedding, but they are mostly obvious like ""consider renting a tent, or reserving one in case it rains."" This is not, by any means, a guide on how to plan an outdoor wedding, but if you just want to look at a few kind of random pictures in order to get ideas on things, than this is a nice book, if expensive."
4,Nice coffee table book,This book includes weddings of all kinds. It is good for one who is planning an outdoor wedding to possibly get decorating ideas from but it seems more designed for the artistic mind who enjoys wedding photography.
4,Beautiful Ideas,The reason I bought this book is because I'm planning a wedding for one of my friends on the beach. As soon as I opened the book the pictures were so perfect. I'm actually recreating the beach wedding the book shows with the bamboo arc. It's perfect if you are still deciding on the atmosphere for you wedding day. It's a wonderful book for wedding planners to show their brides.
4,Not bad,"It's an older book so kind of dated, but gives a slant on Southern politics and the Confederate congress that I had not seen before. Liked it!"
3,Informative but difficult,"Good, interesting information. Not an easy read at all. The names start to run together since they are distinguished very well. Not a recreational reading book for sure."
2,Not Up to Snuff,"We don't like the audio output or microphone performance as well as the previous model G4. What's more, one of the pair was defective when we received it, and we had to pay postage to return it."
5,two great saxaphone players,"this cd brings together two of the best tenor sax player ever,you,ll love how they improvise off of each others lines,harry allen has also just released his long awaited all ballad cd available on line only at www.mcmahonjazzmedicine.com along with his other 29 cd,s"
1,Don't Ask for this Flask,"Sure this flask looks nice with a comfy handheld grip, but the purpose is to be able to store cigarettes on the outside compartment. I gave this gift to someone for the holidays only to find that as soon as cigarettes were placed inside the door didn't close properly (with only 4 cigs) which defeats the purpose of what could have been a handy item!"
4,Review of Colville Review Questions and Answers for Veterinary Technicians,This review book has helped a lot. I like how it is set up into specific sections or areas of study. I feel that this book will help me prepare for the licensing exam!
3,This book is awkward.,"This book contains a lot of good information, but I find it hard to use as a study guide. It's only useful if you want to take the tests to check how well you're doing. It's very difficult to flip back and forth to check answers as you go."
4,AWESOME study tool,"This book is very comprehensive in helping you study for the state boards. The incuded CD allows you to test or quiz yourself on the computer, so you can time your test taking, more of a simulation of the actual (california) state board test. You can choose to test within a single topic (quiz) or random questions from all the topics (test). One negative thing about the CD generated tests, they seem to repeat sevearal of the questions (at least all of the tests I have done did this). I would prefer to have 100 different questions. All in all, it is very helpful for studying, especially for small animal people, cuz it does ask A LOT of large animal questions!"
2,Questions of questionable accuracy and value.,Found multiple questions at first glance that have inaccurate and outdated information. I have contacted Dr. Colville directly as well. Tylenol is not an NSAID ! Beware technicians of using this guide. Format is fantastic but WAY too many half-truths and inaccurate answers to poor questions.
4,VTNE Prep book,Great little book. Complete with cd which has practice questions. I definately would recomend to anyone who is studying for the vtne.
4,good book,"I have yet to go through the whole book but the questions are on a variety of topics and divided up in an easy to understand way. At the end of each section you will find the answers which are useful because many of them not only tell you the correct answer but they also explain why other options are not correct. Reviewing the answer key provides you with a better understanding of the topic. All in all, I am pleased with this book."
4,Comprehensive,"This book covers so much information and has such comprehensive chapters of questions, that if you can complete these, the Veterinary Technician test is a breeze. That being said, it is easy to be overwhelmed when it seems like so many questions are beyond the scope of study."
2,Colville 4th edition,"The format is a decent one, and covers a thorough amount of material. However, the number of errors, and the lack of response from the company is disheartening. I was diligent at doing the first several chapters, but found that my list of errors just kept getting longer, requiring me to use alternate, more reliable sources I already had for accurate information. I did not open the CD, since I felt it would not benefit.I have taken two review online courses, and find both much more accurate, responsive, and well thought out in terms of material offered."
3,A Fascinating Introduction,"For those who find Thomas Pynchon frighteningly intimidating (and who doesn't?), a perusal of these stories will quickly bring The Man down a few notches where you can be certain that he once (once, long ago) was human.The stories, presented chronologically, are also a testimonial to an astounding learning curve, a man who in very little time learned from his mistakes. And there are mistakes: at times you may find yourself chuckling at the young Pynchon's overwriting or callow viewpoints. Yet these are still the works of a budding genius (my favourite, bar none!) and there glimpses aplenty.But don't buy the book for the stories alone! No no no! The candid introduction by Pynchon is the real gem here and, for all those Pynchonites, worth the price of admission."
2,Dangerous for little ones!,"I don't own this item but I recently went to a three year old's Birthday party and she got this as a gift. It got set up and of course all the kids wanted to sit at the table. Every single time they tried, they would tip over in the chairs and fall to the ground (including my two year old)! It happened over and over again, the parents had to put it away to prevent any injuries from happening. I think that 3 is too young, maybe 4 or 5, but then that may be getting too old! The chairs and table are just too lightweight and flimsy, it is a major tipping hazard, I wouldn't recommend getting this set."
2,Nice concept... Bad Presentation,"I purchased this for a friend to use with her costume. The Necklace did not arrive in a silver box as the pictures show, but in a plastic bag. The other big negative I have with this product is that the necklace is not coated with any sort of material. After 30 minutes wearing the item my friends neck started feeling sore due to the strands of wire randomly pinching her neck. I would of requested to return this product but she felt better using it as a decoration in her kids room"
2,Not for software developers/engineers!,"This book may be useful for marketing people, but it is not for software developers!Moreover the authors' attempt to make the book 'fun' is mediocre at best!If you are a software developer/programmer looking to develop J2EE applications, you are better off reading other books, likeHead First Servlets and JSP: Passing the Sun Certified Web Component Developer Examfor servlets & JSP andHead First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)for EJBs. Later you may want to graduate to Spring framework with a book likeSpring in Action."
3,Good cheese. Odd photo.,"I like Tillamook cheese quite a bit, but this photo scares me. Did they just pick it off the grocery shelf, take it home for a photo shoot, and then put it in their fridge until someone orders it online?"
3,Activities -- not classroom management,"The book is pretty much as described in the ""Editorial Review""; that is, ""A collection of imaginative language arts, math, and art activities for grades 3-8. Reproducible master sheets accompany most lessons."" Note that the book does not contain any information on classroom management."
4,Controvercial first album...,"I guess the mighty Turbund Sturmwerk hasn't lived in vain.. ""Imperium Internum"" is surely inspired by the two AWESOME Turbund Sturmwerk releases ""Turbund Sturmwerk"" and ""Weltbrand"", but Von Thronstahl also manage to incorporate Blood Axis/Der Blutharsch/Dark Ritual Ambient elements into their musical mix. The track ""Kristall / Kristur"" stand out with it's percussion-based, militaristic approach with strangulated vocal propaganda, while other tracks are more ambient and evocative. All in all a solid first album, if you can live with the obvious political IN-correctness of Von Thronstahl. The next album could threaten the position of Blood Axis and Turbund Sturmwerk as leaders of this type of music.."
2,If an appearance could kill...,"Being an ex-serviceman of the Soviet Army and Soviet uniform books and dress regulations collector I would not recommend this book to any serious reader. Several pictures show items of field, service and special dress mixed or worn wrongly. Models present a real nightmare for any average sergeant-major: unshaved, long hairs, wearing totally unfitted uniforms (too small or too long sleeves, blouses and trousers are not pressed etc). The art of wrapping putties (see pre-1945 section) must be a great mystery to them (and to the authors). All this is described as ""non-regulation manner of wear"" but in fact present a group of scarecrows rather than regular soldiers.I remember my first sergeant-major who used to say that a real soldier is expected to kill an enemy by his look and appearance. I think - he was telling us the truth. Two stars for binding and dust-jacket."
3,"It is fine, but a little ""bright"" sounding for me.","I bought this when I was recording an album and needed a Guiro for one of the songs. It's very large and well made. The only critique I have with this Guiro is that, being made of synthetics/plastics, it's a little on the bright sounding side, especially with the plastic scrapers that come with the Guiro. In my case I was in a studio and the engineer was able to make it sound like I wanted to achieve. I think I am going to get or make a wooden scraper and see if that sounds better in case I decide to use this in a live situation."
4,Guiro,"This product does its job. It is basically used for certain types of latin music like boleros, danzon, and ballroom latin dancing. in other words, mellow latin music. Now, for more rythm and less melody like the salsa and merengue music, other types of güiros are used. this one is good for what it was designed for.It does the job well. and this company knows how to make them with a good sound."
4,war,I am a war movie watcher always looking for something new. This was it. I never knew about tunnelers in WWI until this movie and then did research afterward to learn more. I recommend this movie for other war movie watchers looking for something new.
4,great movie,"great movie or those history buffs. Full of great actors, with action and some historical value. Would highly recommend to anyone"
3,Good WWI movie,I like war movies. This one was one of the few from WWI and was interesting from the stand point of seeing how the two sides fought the war under ground. I could have rated it higher but not quite 4 stars
5,Beneath Hill 60,"I really like war movies, especially WWII. This movie takes place in WWI, and is about Australian coal miners helping out on the front lines by digging deep to penetrate German defenses. But, more than that there are several interesting character stories (including a love story between the main character and a girl back home) that had me riveted throughout the entire movie. I did have some difficulty understanding the accents in just a few parts, but mostly no problem (heavy Australian accents). For me, this movie was a lot like Saving Private Ryan in that it isn't just about fighting, but also about the human side of war and the heartbreak that comes with it."
2,"HIC Porcelain 4x1"" round quiche dishes","I purchased the set of six quiche dishes under the impression that they were 4"" x 1"". Are they 1"" tall? Yes. Are they 4"" wide? Not by a long shot. Probably about 3 1/2"" on the bottom. False advertising. They're fine for small desserts for elves, but not for the individual quiches I had planned for tomorrow's brunch for actual humans."
3,Springfield Armory swords and sabers,"The book?monograoh itself was in excellent shape and delivered promptly with good packaging. The content of the book was disappointing. Other than some stats there was little meat and potatoes type of information, no in-depth study of development with mostly a reliance on various reports from Chiefs of ordnance, armory commanders. I have visited Sprringfield Armory when doing my own research for a published monograph and was able to view and handle the many examples of swords and saber present in the upper storage area. As usual Amazon and associates delivered, the book/monograph did not. Joe Turner"
3,pictures I've already seen,I enjoy these type of pictures but I was hoping for newer ones. I know there are new ones to be seen but if you haven't seen these yet they should be enjoyed
5,good,"`De cara al futuro' hace referencia a un futuro reino mundial que debería ser establecido por los anticristianos en el mundo. Un tiempo de crisis y desesperación para la tierra. Una trama muy interesante. Lo recomiendo. Recomiendo también el libroResurgir de la esvástica, El (Ebook) [Versión Kindle] el cual habla con mucha claridad sobre estos temas del fin de los tiempos."
5,JVC SR-V101US S-VHS Recorder and Player,Excellent...more then satisfied with all it's pro features & above average quality. A welcome addition to my studio.
3,Professional VCR in a plastic box?,Haven't used it much yet but a professional grade VCR in a plastic box doesn't give me a lot of confidence.
4,Early Higgins that gives his newer work a run for the money.,"I was pleasantly surprised to read this. After immersing myself in the exploits of Sean Dillion, this was a breath of fresh air. Generally, Higgins novels are a quick read, but this lent itself to something different. Being that this is an earlier work, the plot was more imaginative and at times you could almost feel the cold. It's a shame that no one will film this because it is an intelligent thriller that is missing in today's market. Since his characters didn't seem to be based on characters from his other novels, ie. Dillion vs Devlin, it was a joy to read the development and how they interact. Too bad 'ole Jack can't go back to writing more original works like this, but he brings him the $'s, so I doubt that'll change."
5,"Excellent suspense, and plotline.","In the Arctic Circle of Greenland, charter pilot Joe Martin is hired to transport passengers to a newly discovered small plane crash to positively identify the bodies for an Insurance Company. But Joe quickly figures out that his passengers, are playing a much deeper game than an Insurance investigation, but, he doesn't quite know what. Joe doesn't know the object of the game yet, but the rules, as Joe intuitively understands them, do not rule out murder..."
3,East of Desolation,"This fellow Higgins has an uncanny knack of placing his novels in places most of us have never visited. That's what makes them almost page-turners. This one will almost send chills to your bones due to its being thrust into cold, snowy climes. As with all of Jack Higgins' novels, the hero is endangered, yet rides it out and succeeds in living through danger and also, of course, gets the girl. It's just a tad outdated at this point, but still a good read. Charles A. Reap, jr., author, ""Devil's Game,"" ""My Friend Sam"" and ""Choices."""
5,Ideal for quiches,"The plate is ceramic (the first time it arrived broken, but Amazon replaced it at no cost). I use it mostly for quiches, as the pastry will not sick to the mold (as it happened with my previous metal mold), but I suppose it is also good to bake tartes. The size is medium, neither big nor small. I have no complaints and would recommend this item. The price was also reasonable."
2,Warning - Not WinXP Compatible!,"Contrary to what the ""Platform"" above suggests, these games are not really compatible with Windows XP. Read the ""System Requirements."" As that says, SimCity is compatible and worked just fine. I was not so lucky with Sim Theme Park.Sim Theme Park crashed the very first time I tried it. I downloaded an XP fix from the internet and the program did get further along then before. However, it eventually crashed my computer hard - computer shut down and restarted on its own. Even after the restart, my video card acted up until I completely turned off the computer and started it again (a simple restart was not enough). Windows also crashed once.I decided not to install Sim Coaster or Sim Golf after the bad experience with Sim Theme Park.I received these as a gift. Since I'm not out any money, I'll give the package two stars for Sim City.By the way, for those interested, I'm using Window XP Home Edition, AMD Athlon 2.4GHz CPU, 1GB RAM, and 80GB HD."
2,Sim City 3000 - Not With XP !,"SimCity looks like a great game, and having played years of SimCity versions was looking forward to playing SimCity3000 on my new machine.I read the box, had more than enough of what it asked for, and went home to install it. Installed fine, no problems.Opened it, started to play and within 15 minutes the screen went crazy. I could see my city, but the messages and other side-bar icons were gone. Like they no longer knew how to be drawn.I guess I will just be out the money I paid for the game (cannot return opened games) and never buy software that does not indicate XP on the label."
2,all wrong!!!!!,"this didn't install properly, after i got it installed 2 of the games didn't work!!!! sim golf and sim theme park.. totally waste of money and time i feel sorry for my mom who bought this! i wonder what sim mania 3 will include?? if you thought it would be cool to ride your rollercoasters and make them on sim coaster you were wrong. there is not enough power over your coasters and the challenges are hard to beat on sim coaster.sim golf was pathetic!! i couldn't even play sim theme park it didn't work so good!!! golly gee why couldn't they put other sim games in it."
1,Kindle edition is just about unreadable,The book may be good but I will probable never know. The kindle editon doesn't use the normal fonts and the book is just about unreadable. The letters are poorly rendered and missing parts. Perhaps it is a scan?
1,Kindle version unreadable -- Like the last page printed on a dying toner....,"The start of the book was very engaging, but I couldn't get past the horrific font. There were gaps in most vowels, gaps between words, and the density is best described as ""faded"". It was like trying to read the last page printed before the toner dies altogether. I couldn't get past it. I'm hoping the library's print copy uses a crisp font and sufficient ink to make it readable. Otherwise, I may never know how this ends...."
5,Buck Naked Faith,"I was very excited about this book, and it lived up to its expectations.Buck Naked Faith forced me to look inward and see that I had been doing things that were hindering me from real faith. I had gotten too comfortable in my enviroment. If your open to it this book can open you eyes and leave you feeling exposed, which is a fantastic feeling. The growth points were fantastic and really made me be completely honest with myself.This books helps you to see that its okay to be Naked."
2,DVD,"I find some of the techniques in this DVD helpful. However MOST are impractical to anyone who actually needs a cane for support. The Kata is totally useless if you rely on a cane for mobility. He does not cover distance, Most of the techniques are shown at the same distance as if using hand techniques. If you are going to use a weapon, get the most out of it! He also does not practice economy of movement. The side headlock technique shows a strike to the legs to ""soften a male opponent"" prior to a groin strike. A groin strike does not need a ""shock technique"". & NEVER release your weapon if you truly need it for support!! & On the handgun technique dont stop the technique short to do another technique, continue it another 6 inches & disarm the attacker as soon as possible. I did learn some good techniques in this DVD, BUT it is not for beginners. You must be able to sort through what is useful & what is simply filler on a DVD."
4,Good Self Defense Video,This video is very good and I learned many things from it. But I think it is too advanced for people who know nothing about using a cane to protect themselfves. Just my opinion.
2,poor quality,"The part the makes to shoes ""cute"" is the interchangeable color slides that go on the sides of the shoe. I bought thoes for my 9 year old for cheerleading and had to order a womens 6 because they run small. The shoes are not leather and cheaply made. She has wore them 3 weeks and they are falling apart!!"
3,"Cute shoes, easy to customize, no traction!","I bought these shoes to complete my cheerleading costume for a special event. They looked Great!Customizable: The color blocks are easy to interchange, they tie into the laces, so they stay well, too.Size: The shoes were very comfortable, and I found them true to size - I wear an 8 1/2, and I bought the size 9. As with running shoes, I find that you should always go up at least a 1/2 size to account for the forward motion, and they fit perfectly. There was a little extra room, as expected, but when jumping around in them, I found them to be great.Traction: My only concern was that there was little to no traction. This may not matter for your use of the shoes, but I was wearing them on a slick dance floor, and when someone spilled a drink, I fell pretty hard. If using on a track surface, grass, or other ""standard"" cheerleading materials, this may not be a concern for you."
3,Good but runs small,"This seems to be a very nice shoe, but they run incredibly small! My daughter is normally a 12 1/2, so I ordered 1 13 1/2 and she could not even get her foot in it. You then have to pay a $5.00 re stock fee to exchange the size!I would not have been so annoyed with this, had the description said runs small! We are awaiting the new pair. The original came pretty quickly (about 4-5 days) I sent them back a week ago."
2,A Waste,This book is useless. Anyone who has spent time aorund other humans is already aware of the body language descriptions in this book. It is basically a picture book of gestures that are so obvious. Dont waste your money.
1,"Low, low level...","This book is really a poor book ! Read in less than two hours, it may have an interest for people who have not the slightest idea about that subject... There is no science in that book ! I regret the few bucks I have paid for it...If you read French and you want a really good book on non-verbal communication, try Jacques Corraze ""Les communications non-verbales"" that is a top level book !"
1,secondhand pop anthropology,"There is, generally, an off-the-top-of-the-head quality to this book. But I base my harsh judgment specifically on his remarks about gestures in Greece. I've spent enough time, the better part of a year, in Greece to have my own ideas about it, and in fact, I was there around the time he published this book. Some quite prominent gestures, differing from the Anglo-American lot, are left unnoted, and others are mis-interpreted. I don't believe he did any ""research"" in Greece. Was he even there?In another of his books, he states authoritatively that men who are attracted to women with small breasts are homosexuals, whether they want to admit it or not. What book was it, you ask? Ah, some book or other, not this one ... Some book or other, he's written ... oh, never mind."
5,A much needed work,"This scathing rebuttal to the commonly accepted version of the personal events in Ayn Rand's life is a much-needed work. It succeeds primarily by using the Branden's own published words against them - demonstrating (as only a prosecuting attorney could) their abhorrent exploitation of the very woman who provided the only success they could ever claim. It also lays bare the souls of the Brandens - and shows why it is not surprising that they still continue to profit from trivializing her legend long after her death.The personal lives of authors and philosophers are generally of little import in understanding their works and ideas. However in this case, the Ad Hominem attacks fueled by the Branden's deceptions have all but crippled scholarly debate on the subject of her philosophy. Hopefully, this work will help to rectify that situation. In any event, it is gratifying to know that Ayn Rand has her own ""Prince Valliant"" providing a much-needed defense. Well done."
5,A long overdue act of justice,"In a brilliant analysis of the contradictions, misrepresentations and outright lies in the Branden books, Mr. Valliant demonstrates ""the stomach reqired of a medical student"" by painstakingly debunking every myth that passes for a ""biography"" of Ayn Rand's life.On top of that, in reading Rand's journals on the subject of Branden's psychological state, we see her preceptive mind at work, never judging until she has conclusive proof.Mr. Valliant's grasp of the philosophy of Objectivism shines through, as he explains abstract concepts that the layman can easily understand.This is a first rate work, that is long overdue.Thank you!"
3,"Thumbs Up, Miss Rand; Thumbs Down, Mr. Valliant","Recommended, but with serious reservations. The author's heart was in the right place, but his book's subject was too much for his head. Indeed, his subject deserved and would have benefited greatly from treatment by a stronger writer with a better mind. Valliant's writing lacks articulate, persuasive force as well as tight organization and analytical clarity. His illuminations and arguments have all the enlightening power of a firefly; Ayn Rand deserved a torchbearer's touch. This book's sole asset is the first-time-published private journal writing of Miss Rand, revealing a great mind passionately and precisely trying to understand the disturbing psychological vagaries of her closest colleague and romantic partner."
1,Appalling and offensive,"I began to read PARC with an open mind. From the first pages, however, I found it appalling; so much so that I began marking pages and writing in the margins. The notes were only to be for me but I soon began to read how many in the community admired and liked the book. I can't understand how anyone can like this book. [...]"
1,"This book was unreadable...and I am ""Moderate"" about Rand","Having loved Rand's novels when young, and failing to live up to the ""standards"" of her heroes, I have always been interested in the woman, her followers and what made us all tick. I enjoyed ""The Passion of Ayn Rand"" and although it might not be perfect and had some overly simple conclusions about her, I found Barbara Branden to be believable and humane. The same came be said for the other imperfect if sincere explorations of her life.The overlong persistence of this rant about the Branden's bordered on mental illness of the author. If you must read this, do not buy at full price!"
2,tedious,It goes on and on nitpicking in many cases. the supposed contradictions he finds in the brandens are often so small as to be trivial. who knows who was right? but branden was much more interesting.
4,You get what you pay for...,"Overall a fairly good case that travels well, stores easily, pages turn with relative ease, and has a good quality zipper. Maybe a little pricey but I don't feel ripped off."
4,Good,"Seems good, only complaint is the sleeves are not removable..it seems I could fit a lot more sleeves in there if this were possible."
4,Nice product,"The case is great. The nylon is heavy duty. I'm glad to have a nylon case, instead of the new fake leather. The little removable 8 CD holder is okay. I guess it's nice to have a removable item, but at the same time, if I'm going to buy a case this large, I'd rather just have another page in the case. Plus the removable case is barely held into the sleeve area by a tiny piece of velcro. That won't last very long. And as another reviewer mentioned, the sleeve opening is facing down when you hold the case by the handle. It would have been more secure if the sleeve opening were facing towards the handle, but who knows how that would have looked design-wise, so maybe that's why they made the opening facing down. But overall, no problems and I like the case. I gave 4 stars just because of the removable sleeve that is not really that secure and I would have rather had an extra page in the case in its place."
2,Poorly Written and No Practical Advise,"I was very disappointed after I received and read this book.There were only 90 pages - large space between lines. It was filled with mispelled words.The worst part is that there was no ""thread"" - it was spaced-out in thought and content. There was no clear beginning and end. In fact, I got to the end of this book and wondered, ""Is that IT?""I saw no practical advice within the pages."
1,Who wrote these reviews - the writer's family?,"OK, I would love to find out who wrote these reviews. The book is HIGHLY OVERRATED!!! I bought this book based on a couple of the reviews on this site and was very disappointed. The only thing I agree with is that book has some wit in it."
2,Not very practical,"Being a first-time bridesmaid (for my best friend's wedding in October), I am thrilled and at the same time I want to make sure I have all the important information that I need to know. While this book offers some broad strokes on bridesmaiding, I found a lot of the information to be impractical. It tends to assume that there are many maids in the party (I am one of only three) and it places emphasis on themes and games - both of which don't apply to a lot of today's less traditional brides. I feel like it needs an update to become more useful."
4,Cute Book,"The book was very cute, fast read, but I was expecting just a little more information. It goes over very general basic knowledge with just a handful of pointers that I will actually use. Other than that, I loved everything about it. Seller was great, book was in fantastic condition even though it was used, quick, easy, painless transaction."
3,Nice guide to the bridesmaid thing,"As a first time bridesmaid and maid of honor, I picked up this book for some party planning ideas. I found it to be pretty good and a fun read. It was also very helpful on outlining the duties of a bridesmaid, but some of the party ideas were a little dated--like 1800s dated. They suggested a Jane Austen-themed bachelorette party. While I think forcing my sister to go to bars in a bonnet would be hilarious to me, I don't think its how she wants to spend her night. So I would recommend this book, but I wouldn't use it for bachelorette plans unless you're looking for something really, really vintage."
5,Great book and easy to read,"This book offers a great overview of what it takes to be a bridesmaid. Has good tips and great timelines for planning showers and bachelorette parties. It is also easy to read and well written, with lots of humor thrown in. It gives you all the basics you need to know."
3,Warning: Be careful who you give this to!,"As the bride, I thought this was the cutest book and very informative. I've never been a bridesmaid, so it helped me feel less over welmed because I realized I could ask my bridesmaids for help. I read all the reviews and everyone said it was so great and that the bridesmaids loved it too. The one review I never read is that although the book itself is great, you really have to be careful who you give this to. The book is pretty intense and although I certainly wouldn't expect my Maid of Honor or bridesmaid to do everything in it, some bridesmaids may find this sort of book very offending. I thought of it as a fun little gift when asking them to be my bridesmaid, whereas one of my bridesmaids completely flipped out and felt that it was rude, instructional and over welming, to say the least. Just be careful who you give this to."
4,Study and devotion in one,"A great book that offers scripture in bite-sized passages. When studying Paul's letters I didn't know much about the context or situations of that time. These books (there's three or four in the series so far) help with lots of background and little snipets that would otherwise be unknown to people like me. When you read a passage in your translation then you pick up a book in this series and read about that same passage, lots of issues get cleared up. Also works great for small discussion groups. I hope they continue to print more on other books of the Bible."
3,MUCH BETTER COMMENTARY,"It is clear Knight doesn't understand why Ap. Paul uses the expression ""in Christ"" so many times in Ephesian.Here you will find the explanation and much better commentary by Jack Sequeira:<...>"
4,Aladdin,This was enjoyed at the time but didn't seem to have much staying power. It is certainly a fine version.
3,Robin Williams is Back In The Blue!,"This DTV sequel of Aladdin would not have been as great without the talents of Robin Williams. The animation is very DTV-ish, with the exception of the Vanishing Isle sequence. The music is fair, but does not capture the spirit of Alan Menken, Howard Ashman or Tim Rice's music. The story is about Aladdin and Jasmine getting married. During the ceremony, a band of forty thieves bust in. The king of thieves is actually Aladdin's long lost dad, Kasim [John Rhyes Davies of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy]. The villain here is Saluk, played by the late Jerry Orbachs, who you probably know from Law & Order and Beauty and the Beast.Robin Williams brings back all his wackiness and impersonations, including Forest Gump, Woody Allen, a funny spoof of the Osmonds.[''Boys! Come out here and see what's happening!''], Pumbaa, Mickey Mouse, and Rambo. The funniest scenes are when Genie is trying to cheer up Jasmine and a wild scene in The Vanishing Isle."
3,Not as good as the original.,"I liked the movie, as did my 3 & 4 yr olds, but just not as good as the first movie. My kids have not requested to watch it in a very long time like most of the other Disney movies we own. It is a good movie - just not as much of a hit as The Lion King and Toy Story. Rent it. Then you'll know whether buying it is worth it or not.1smileycat :-)"
2,Another lame Disney sequel,"Ok so this wasn't quite as bad as Aladdin 2, but it was definitely not what it could have been. The genie jokes are WAY, WAY, WAY overdone. Yeah I get it that they were excited to have Robin Williams back as the voice of the genie, but giving Genie as much screen time as possible made his jokes make me grind my teeth after a while. There were some exciting scenes when Aladdin and his father were out to grab the hand of Midas, etc. but a lot of it seemed far too predictable. It reminded me a little too much of Bambi II."
3,"Willams good, but the plot bad","'Aladin and the King of Thives' was the worst Disney movie ever. Robin Willams was the only thing from a stupid movie. Aladin and Jasmin are finaly getting married, but he learns that his father is alive (Aladin thought that his father abonaded him) Aladin also learns that his father is a the King of the Fotry Theives. This move is not a kepper. Take adives save your breth dont't buy this movie!!"
3,"Aladdin, king of thieves","Love the original. This one is not as good. My son was looking forward to watching it, but we stopped about half way thru. I think younger kids 12 and under would enjoy it..."
4,Aladdin and the King of Theives,"Good story that takes place after the first Aladdan when he is getting ready to marry the princess and discovers he is the son of the King of Theives.. Good story line, well written and performed. My grandchildren loved it.. Not quite as good as the first but close. Robin Williams is in it as the Genie.. I would recommend to anyone."
4,Worthy of the Original,"Aladdin and the King of Thieves is a great film. The best character is Aladdin's long-lost father - Cassim, the leader of the legendary forty thieves. A little Temple of Doom, a little swashbuckling, a little Sinbad, great costume designs, a lot of action and adventure, and a surprisingly thoughtful script. A must-have for Disney and Aladdin fans.The story begins as Al and Jasime prepare to be wed. The wedding is interrupted by the mysterious King of Thieves, after a treasure in Jasmine's wedding gifts. Aladdin seeks to have a relationship with his father, but how can he if their lifestyles are so different? Or are they really the same? Like real life, nothing is cut-and-dry or simple about this reunion. Really well-done, and Robin Williams provides great comic relief. I laughed out loud a couple of times at some references to other Disney characters. ""Pocahontas!"""
5,Nice Cool,"Horray! Aladdin and Jasmine get married! Yeah! Well this movie is sooo great. I like the song ""party in agrabah"". This movie is from any age! Cool! I'll recomend this for you."
3,Progressively...blah,"The Aladdin movies got progressively worse. Aladdin is of course, a classic, because Disney put much more effort into it (obviously) than the other two. In the two second movies, the detail gets lower and lower in quality (a.k.a. the carpet has a less intricate design, the characters faces look more cartoony...etc.) Not only in this one did the animation lack, but so did the story line. It was expected that Disney would run out of original ideas , and would have to borrow from another Arabian Nights tale. Though the voice talents were just as extraordinary, and the emotions just as strong, the plot was thin, and the overall movie was not as good as possible."
3,Good read,"Stories a bit lengthy oral reading to elementary students, and I would use this in Grades 7 and up."
2,Too much hassle,"The 360 degree view is great, i actually like the game itself, but its got problems. I have to save the game every five minutes because it shuts itself down a lot. In the witness interviews, if u ask the wrong questions, it shuts down too- and it doesnt save all the work you've done. It would be fun, but its just not worth all the hassle."
2,Ok Game,"Something tells me being on the show isn't as difficult as playing this game. The controls are sloppy, there's no easy way just to get into the game and play, you have to jump through some serious hoops to get far in this game."
2,horrible!,"after playing the CSI games, i guess i'm spoiled. the graphics with Law and Order are pretty good, but navigating throughout the rooms gives me a headache, the instructions and hints are vague and worthless, and the case itself is boring. i unstalled it without even obtaining a search warrant."
3,Just Not As Much Fun,"I liked the first two games much better than this one. This one was more frustrating, it just didn't ""flow"". I would often run out of things to ask people and would have to look at an on-line walk through, which I hate to do. It usually ended up being some silly thing I missed, but would have never thought of and/or didn't seem logical thing to do. The game didn't seem to have any sequence, like the others, and felt very ""mixed up"". The puzzles varied from very easy to medium difficulty. The dialog was very annoying, your partner constantly comments on every little thing, and I mean EVERY LITTLE THING! There were a few bugs in the game, freezing, jumping, etc. The graphics I did not feel were as good as the prior games and some of the characters voices were much lower than others. The plot was good, but again, not as much fun as the other 2 games. If you like the series, it's worth playing once, but don't expect it to be better than the first 2."
4,Provocative,"I had the good fortune of seeingAugustat the Honolulu Rainbow Film Festival. A beautifully shot film, it stays with you after it's over. The leads are charismatic and make you root for them, even if you don't necessarily like their behavior.August is languid and steamy, with the L.A. summer heat playing a key role. The ever-rising sexual tension between the characters is intense, palpable, and most important, truly believable; no small feat in cinema.Not a feel good rom-com, but a treatise on lost love and sexual heat, August is definitely worth watching and buying."
2,The rest of the year should get better,"First of all stop making movies that promote that turning 30 in a gay man's life is the most defining and tumultuous moment...it is getting stale and a bit too convenient to wrap a story around this ""weak"" plot.Second, the movie plays with the same old themes of ""what if"" and ""the one that got away""...many gay men have no problem with moving forward with their lives and allowing themselves to be happy and satisfied with the lives they have constructed. Troy seems to have a pull on Jonathan for no other reason than it is easy to be disconnected to life that he put forth after two years being separated. Always remember there is a reason why you broke up with someone and time does not erase that reality or make it any less apparent.Lastly, the acting is alright...however, the constant exposing of flesh as if that is all which is required to sustain the movie..."
2,Annoying movie,"Some might not have issues with this kind of movie, but it really grates on my nerves. I can't stand movies that focus on infidelity and this one virtually revels in it. Gay relationships are already viewed with great disdain if not outright hostility by straights and it seems like too many gay movies do nothing but reinforce that point of view, even by our own community. It seems far too rare to find any movies that truly paint our relationships in a positive light to ourselves or the outside world from which we strive to gain acceptance."
2,I don't even remember it.,I do not even remember this movies. I was home sick watching gay romance movies. I wish there were more.
2,Confusing and full of typos,"This book can be quite confusing at times, and is best used with a teacher in a class. It's not designed for self-study. There are quite a few errors in the book as well. The editor needs to go through it again and fix the mistakes. Some sections introduce a grammar point, and then offer NO practice for that point."
1,A misleading message,"The book though titled Grammar in Context (ESL Series) is actually a booklet of about 48 pages with merely some drills and keys in it. The book is of no use unless you already have Grammar in Context (paperback edition). In my opinion, this booklet should be treated as an attachment to the original book Grammar in Context and ought not to be sold separately . Besides, all the bookreviews under the item are related to the original book Grammar in Context (paperback edition). So be careful when you order the book. I suggest the bookreviews under this item be removed."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I got this map based on the Amazon reviews and found that it was less than what I had expected. It is a large scale map of the Colorado Sangre de Cristo mountains printed on good quality paper. But... it doesn't even show the northern 30 square miles of the Sangre de Cristo wilderness despite claiming to show the ""Northern Sangre de Cristo"" mountain area. It doesn't differentiate between public and private land. It doesn't accurately show where motorized vehicles are prohibited. The trail desciptions are very brief and basically just summaries.For the price of this one map you could do about as well getting maps from the US Forest Service (San Isabel National Forest) and the US Bureau of Land Management (Canon City and Blanca Peak), although they aren't as large a scale and not as thick paper."
4,seems to work,"We give one of these to our older Doberman after a good run--seems to help keep him more comfortable. Actually bought this relatively inexpensive product to get my order up to the $25.00 amt. for free shipping, but would order it again."
3,My dog took 1 and threw up,"and threw up, and threw up, and threw up. Yes, four times. She's 88 pounds and 1 pill did this to her. $150 carpet cleaning did not get rid of all the ""evidence"" that she did not take this medicine too well. Vets seems to be on both sides of the issue on giving your dog aspirin. I now know where I stand! It could be my dog's own sensitivity so I will give it a 3 star and not blame the mess entirely on the product."
1,Horrible Smell,"These smell so bad, our dog refused to eat them after the first few (even I can smell them, even after they're hidden in food). I bought several bottles, and they all smell the same.I've tried hiding them in peanut butter, cheese, hotdogs, even mixing them up with his food. (He refuses to eat the food, if it's mashed up in it. And we're talking about a large dog portion, so it's a lot of food for 2 small pills). The few times we managed to trick him into eating them, they did ease his pain for roughly 2 hours. That was a blessing, but not worth the constant hassle. He's grown so suspicious of his food, he's getting finicky in eating anything, which is a problem we didn't anticipate, and could be a serious problem down the road."
3,unnecessary?,"The first time i glanced at this book I thought that i was looking at 'The Backpackers Handbook', also by Townsend. This seemed, and still seems to be, more or less a duplication of that previous guide. If you don't own the 'Handbook', then definitely check this out, I really like Chris' open-minded writing and hiking style.The only new information in 'Advanced Backpacker' is brief; and can be found on the internet or in your library for free. But if you really want a wholesome guide to carry with you, then this should be the one."
4,Very good music!,"If you like Tzn's first cd ""Rosso Relativo"", you will truly enjoy listening to this one...it is very unique on music and how he is able to turn normal daily life experiences into lyrics that make sense, and accompany them with very hip beats....I truly enjoy listening to TZN."
5,111 times better than other italian artists!,"Very good indeed - I only listened to ""rosso relativo"" a few times but I think this good as that! I'm sure I will buy that too in the future! For me this album it's so hot coz its rnb/hip hop in italian :))"
1,A Waste,"There are two songs on this CD that are solid. The rest are pretty hard to tell apart and not memorable at all, I would suggest just downloading the two because it's definitely not worth the money to buy this, the cover and insert aren't even cool."
1,wow....,these guys pretty much suck. there really isnt more to say about them besides that. they are not creative and they suck at their instruments. i gave them a star because they actually took the time to record it.
4,No Good Deed Goes Unpunished,"The Literary Review mentions this book's compassion and intellectual energy. While I have no argument with the latter, ""compassion"" is the very antithesis of this dark and brooding story. A CHANGE OF CLIMATE revolves around the lives of Ralph and Anna Eldred, two British missionaries who, in their endeavor to make living easier for others, endure tremendous cruelty and heartbreak through the same grace of God. The story spits in the face of compassion. It is a fable with the moral ""no good deed goes unpunished."" Though Mantel is obviously a gifted writer, I did not find this book to be enthralling. It was more a bleak outlook on the way of the world; one of which I'd rather not be reminded."
2,British Sensibilities,"Save your money. Or, if you need to spend it, buy plain yogurt -- you will find the bland white stuff much more exciting than this novel. If you do buy this book, you will wade through pages and pages waiting for the story to get started and then you will not care about a single character you meet. In the course of the book, there are love affairs, savage beatings, and a kidnapping or two, and all these incidents unfold without an ounce of passion, desire, or emotion. Anna, the long suffering wife, is so strangled that she can't bring herself to demand a new washing machine. She and her obtuse husband never talk to each other or to their children. And we are supposed to care about the marriage of these two? Buy yogurt."
4,Easy to use,"This is a easy to use book to use with lots of games to play. In keeping with the Montessori way, kids will not know they are learning. As a parent, the games and instructions are easy to follow. The book encourages you to follow the games in sequence, as they build on eachother. I liked that short explanations were given for each game reagrding what it would teach the children. One thing, it does assume having some of the Montessori tools/toys such as sandpaper letters which you can buy or make yourself. But many of the gamse require only you and your kid. Good book, I am moving toward a Montessori house and hope my kids will benefit from it."
3,"User friendly, accesible to home-schoolers and students alik","Lynne Lawrence has written a user friendly book that does not asume anything. Homeschoolers will love it. This is the tried and trusted method of teaching reading and writing in hundreds of Montessori schools around the world. Montessori students will use it for its clarity, illustrations and thoroughness."
2,Save Your Money,"Some information presented in this book is interesting and informative. It is at the very end of the book that Eicher shows his true stripes.He uses his conclusions to criticize Southern historians for historical revisionism and Southerners in general as living in a fantasy land of Confederate heroes and dreams of the ""Lost Cause."" This is typical patronization of the Southerner who is proud of his heritage and history. Save you money and purchase a history written to present facts and not to forward an agenda."
1,Pure political correctness and pure fantasy,"This book is a huge dose of fantasty and political correctness. He could have written about the war crimes committed by the Lincoln government. Lincoln held his nation together by suppression of the press, imprisonment of innocents and various and numerous war crimes. To say the South was not defeated by overwhelming military and industrial might paints one as a sheer nutcase. If he author cannot write the truth he should just label his books what they are....fiction."
1,Eicher's Analysis,"Eicher offers his own significant analysis of what he views as the central issue: I don't need it and I want buy it!Would someone please tell me any war in any country that has not, does not have disputes, factions and all the rest that Eicher's describes in his Analysis.It is obvious that the winners of these wars are alkl about stiking terror into the hearts of the people, who they deem their foes. They are terriorist, demanding, cruel and want to win at any cost (ex:LINCOLN, HITLER), they should be judged by their actions and not what they say.The South lost the War because they were too Civilized!"
3,A Good Survey,"Overall, this was a very easily digestible and enjoyable book to read. At the core of ""Dixie Betrayed"", Eicher is making two arguments. They are arguments that have been made many times before. First, that the ideological nature of the states rights argument probably doomed the C.S.A., and second, that Lost Cause romanticism has created a distortion of the true narrative of the American Civil War. However, these are good arguments to make.I feel like this book was intended to be approachable to a wide audience but will not serve much of a purpose for veteran Civil War scholars. In essence, I liked this book and learned a great deal from it but something about it makes it feel like it isn't quite the stuff that a professor teaching me the subject would assign.I think this book best serves people looking for a general study of the Civil War in a quick and painless fashion and anyone who has never looked at a good argument against the Lost Cause outlook of the war."
2,Provocative Title with Little Substance,Dixie Betrayed tells of the relationships between Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederacy and many of the politicians and generals in that nation. The idea that a government dominated by state-rights advocates is weak is certainly not new. Eicher sets out to show the weakness of the Confederate central government through a series of vignettes describing the relation between Davis and some other person in the government. The two main problems with this approach are: (1) Eicher assumes I know lots of things about the obscure people in the Confederate government already (which I don't); and (2) there seems to be no central thesis that is supported.I expect that a well written biography of Davis would cover most of this material in a much more comprehensive manner.
3,show it on a real persons head!,This is a good helmet. Good price and everyting as promised. I bought it as a backup to put in my bags. The negatives are it sits really high on your head due to the inside padding and the vinyl straps make your face sweat.
5,Works well,Good quality filter that works well. We installed this at our office to filter our Bunn coffee machine. There was an immediate improvement in the taste of our coffee. Installs easily once you get the first connectors on the water line. After that it just snaps in and out to change with no tools needed.
3,Replaced a leaker,I got excellent delivery time on this order for a filter to replace a GE filter that leaker in the metal casing and ruined my flooring while we were out of town. State Farm will fix the floor but I am looking for an alternative filter system. It has worked well for a few years but now I will turn off the water when I leave and find a filter that looks to be heavy duty.
5,Wonderful,"Received quickly, east to install, works great. It is great to have good tasting ice cubes."
4,Just what I needed,The filter came quickly and was exactly what the seller said it was. It took me about 20 minutes to set it up and it worked perfectly!
2,Refund,I ORDERED FILTER gxrtqr however with my consent I received GXRTDR OF A LESSOR VALUE. hOWEVER AS OF TODAY NO REFUND OR EVEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY e mAILELNovelli@AOL>COM
2,Not so good...,"I'm sure the filter itself is decent enough, but I never even got that far. The product comes with plastic quick-disconned fittings that get fastened to the copper tubing by compression. Problem is the compression nut is brass, and the fitting is plastic. If you dont' have the threads exactly lined up, it is extremely easy to strip the threads. Which I did... Haven't looked yet how available a replacement quick-disconnect fitting is, but my guess is not readily available. Recommend to GE that they make the quick disconnects out of brass or something more robust than plastic."
4,"GE GXRTO, Hard to find filter","I have used this product for years, up until a few years ago you could purchase it in the stores. Seems now they are scarse as hen's teeth. Glad I was able to find this online at a reasonable price. It works great for the filtration of water and ice for my GE refrigerator. Easy to attach, makes this model a good choice."
5,Great water filter,Very simple to install and put in would not need instruction if you have a water line and filter in place I would recommend this product.
3,On the small side,"Nice looking but, cannot be used for much more than a small veggie dish or a very simple dessert. Too shallow."
5,Nuts and bolts of elk hunting,Great DVD for an elk hunter no matter what your experience level is. It walks you through the many facets of what it takes to be a successful elk hunter. Great hunting and conservation message. Get it!
5,just what I wanted,The book was in the conditioned that it was described to be in and shipped quickly. I would buy future books from this seller. There were no problems.
4,Long lost love,"It's too bad there aren't more people out there who had the opportunity to watch this movie every time it came on HBO or cable when they were young. Fortunately, I did. However, many years passed and I forgot all about this movie until one day a friend and I were talking about old movies we watched over and over and over again. I could remember the story and characters but not the name of this movie. After extensive researce I uncovered Superfuzz and to my surprise that same friend had an old copy of it! I immediatly borrowed it but felt that I needed a copy of my own, and not one that was recorded. This movie is a classic, besides, has there ever been a bad movie with Ernest Borgnine in it? I'll be checking my mail twice a day, thanks Amazon."
4,Bought the DVD...,"and it's not bad (when I say this I mean the quality of the DVD). I bought this for my sister for christmas and we watched this together. The movie is excellent as well as the sound but the picture looked a little bland. Usually when an old film gets made into a DVD it would have a more remastered, colorful look to it but this version looked like I was watching the old VHS version. I don't regret getting this film because along with my sister I love it but my only gripe is with the picture quality."
5,awesome movie,Im so glad I found this movie I watched it when I was little with my dad and loved it. Im so glad I found it because I want to show it to my kids.
5,Super Fuzz is the best.,This is a movie that I have been searching for since I was 7 years old. I have been to every movie page available and was unable to find it. Amazon.com is all that they claim to be.
5,An all-time great!,"Super Fuzz is a very funny movie. I absolutely loved it as a kid; I haven't seen it since, so my perception might be altered by time, but I can't wait to see it again! Nobody has this movie. Amazon.com rules!!"
5,One of the Greatest Stupid Movies Ever!!!,"My favorite movie type is StupidMovies! Example AirPlane 1 & 2, Caddy Shack 1 #2 sucked, Night Patrol, Hamburger the Motion Picture, Top Secret, Nakid Gun 1, 2 & 3, Hot Shots 1 & 2, Student Bodies, Wacco, And of course Super Fuzz! I own most all these movies but one and I will have it August! There are so many more Stupid movies and there almost all great! Quote,""Every time I see red I lose my super powers.""Ok for those of you who dont know.What the movies about:A cop (fuzz) goes to issue a ticket and gets caught in a nuclear test blast. Of course he don't die like a normal person but instead devolops Super powers! The rest of the movie is the bad guys / girls trying to put a stop to his saving the day!There is a lot more to it, Like taking a piece of bubble gum and blowing it up to the size of a hot air balloon and flying to safety. However it is much better experienced than told about so buy it and see it! A must See!! 4 thumbs up."
3,Good to see again after all these years.,"As a five year old, I thought Super Fuzz was the best film in the world. Now, 16 years later I still laughed and found it to be good. Definitely a family film, it has very clean content. The plot is a little silly, but what can one expect in a film that stars a police officer with super powers?"
3,superfuzz supercool,"All these reviews follow my sentiments exactly. I watched this movie and ""Watch Out We're Mad"" at the movie theatre in '81 in Mexico City! Terrence Hill and Bud Spencer were my heroes! I had no idea at that age that they were of the spaghetti western ilk. If you have never seen this movie you may wonder what the big deal is, but if you saw it as a much younger version of yourself, you will have a chuckle. Again."
3,Fun spoof is good for Hill fans and kids,"Terence Hill here appears without Bud Spencer. Instead, Ernest Borgnine plays the straight man, and does it well enough. There are a fair number of really fun Terence Hill gags and slapstick scenes, but halfway through the film its pacing slackens and the plotting becomes unbelievable even by spoof standards. Those who enjoy the Terence Hill gags highlighting this film (and those gags ARE very funny) are advised to check out the three TRUE classics of his comedy: ""Crime Busters,"" ""Go For It,"" and ""Odds and Evens,"" all co-starring Bud Spencer and available through Amazon."
1,Love The Movie - Hate The Transfer!!,"As a prior reviewer mentioned, the DVD case says ""Widescreen,"" but what's in the package is full screen. What's more, it seems like the picture is slightly stretched lengthwise! I tried this DVD on three different players and they produced the same result. I'm thinking there was a screwup at the processing house. I saw a review at IMDB that says their copy is widescreen while another review says theirs is not. What's the deal?"
2,"Awful, but I liked it!","This silly movie is badly acted, has terrible effects and probably one of the worst theme songs ever performed. Yet I've always had a sneaking affection for it, probably because Terence Hill goes at his role with such gusto.Rating: 4/10."
4,"Now that I have it, I'll never let it leave sight!",My favorite movie 15 years ago. Now to be my favorite movie again. True classic of the 80's. A must get/you probably already want it if you're here. All my friends wanted to know where did I get this....well here it is. Just click that lil cart at the top. p.s. THANK YOU AMAZON.COM
4,Still A Classic,"This is still a classic. I remember seeing this movie as a kid, and laughing at some of the crazy antics that were going on. I had to add it to my dvd collection."
4,Great 80's Classic,I just received this movie the other day. About the DVD itself the top cover says that it is widescreen when it is not. It is full screen. The video looks great but the audio is a bit distorted. Other than those small things I am so glad this movie came out on DVD.
3,"i loved it as a kid , my kids love it but it's not as much fun as i remember","i gave this 3 stars because my boys like this movie, just as i did growing up,but it doesn't hold up very well to me now. still a nice family movie with nothing to bad for kids to see."
3,same but different,"The DVD I received was within the cover for Super Fuzz, but the title on the DVD and of the movie was ""Super snooper"" and the title song was super snooper as well. This is NOT the version of this movie I thought I was buying. Someone made a switcheroo and put the European version with terrible music, and so loud you couldn't even hear the dialogue at times. There were also many places where there were no sound effects like the car engine and other regular sounds but only the too loud terrible music from this song and lower, somewhat inaudible dialogue, poorly dubbed. I am very dissappointed that Amazon would sell this title, which I was very much looking forwards to. Shame on whoever ripped me off like this!"
5,Can't wait to see this one again!!!,"I would say I have been trying to remember the name of this movie for the past 5 years. Every once in a while I'd try to Google scenes I remembered from the flick. Finally, I posted what I remembered in a Movie Forum and recieved a reply that day! I was probably like 5 years old when this movie was on TV. For a long time I wandered if this movie even existed because the scenes I remembered were ridiculously insane. Anyways, reading these reviews humored me in that many others seemed to have this experience/connection with this cheesy flick."
3,good Flick,Super Fuzz is a great flick! I'm glad I got it at Blockbuster Video for 99 cent. It's good but not worth 17 bucks.
5,OMG,"Last time I saw this movie it had to be over 22 years ago. I remember little, but what little I do remember was hillarious. HBO used to show this movie over and over and we just couldn't get enough of it. Looking forward to seeing it again soon. The really bad acting, yep as a kid it stood out to me, made it so b movie ish you just couldn't resist it.Plot: Essentially there is a cop who gets super powers (can't remember exactly how, I think lightning hits him) and he and his buddy, Earnest Borgnine, are trying to disarm some threat/bad guy. The only real parts I can remember are him walking on the ceiling in one scene. And then of course at the end when he blows a bubble with his gum so large it's a giant helium bubblegum baloon that he uses to fly over the San Francisco bridge and get the bad guys."
5,American Indian Hero Recognized,"Finally, the first biography of the best friend Lewis & Clark, and the American government, had among their Indian hosts, Chief Sheheke of the Mandan. ""White Coyote"" was mis-named ""Big White"" by Lewis & Clark, and is known better by that name. He is the chief who returned with Lewis and Clark to Washington to be greeted by Jefferson himself. It was the delayed and troubled return of Sheheke to the Mandan Villages that ultimately led to Meriwether Lewis's death. A fascinating new angle on the Lewis & Clark Expedition, with keen insights into the amazing Mandan Indian culture. You won't be disappointed."
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this pump 2 months ago and it now has no pressure. It started out good and was very happy, but now as I've been on hold for 25min. with Beckett customer service and I am getting very frustrated."
4,Pond Pump,"I am very happy with service, price and the pump. Will no more by end of winter. Would certainly do business this business again."
1,Beckett WaterFAIL Pump,"Bought this pump in May 2011. Hooked it up for my fountain, who's previous pump worked for 12 years. This one lasted all of about 6 months. Of course, it was running 3 hours a day!Junk. Less than junk. Worthless. Less than worthless. $175.00 + labor WORTHLESS"
4,Great product,Beckett 7115010 Waterfall Pump 5000gphI purchased this pump to replace a Danner 02665 Proline pump that quite working after 2 weeks.DO NOT PURCHASE FROM Danner!!! Bad products and worse customer service.This Beckett pump has been working great for over a year on my pond with waterfall that runs constantly.I would highly recommend this product.
3,Campbell shows off her legs!,"It is sad to see talent like Sutherland and Macy go sour with flick like this! Sutherland and Macy are a father & son hitmen. Dad gives the order and son disposes of target. What a bad choice for hitman! Macy goes to psychiatrist (Jack Tripper-Hahaha)and tell him he kills for a living. Later, he tells him that he has ""fallen in love"" with fellow lobby psycho Campbell that at one time during the flick shows her legs! (Why?--cluck! cluck!) Oh, how sad the ending! Reminiscent to the Orson Welles days of directing when the ""flow"" would SUDDENLY run out & the ending would be abrupt..."
3,symbolic,"There is a scene in the middle of the movie when Alex takes his son to see his grandfather, who has bought him a birthday present. It is the most interesting scene of the movie, and the heart from which everything else should radiate. It is the only time that Alex, his father, and his son are all onscreen at the same time and you realize that this is the conflict that is killing Alex -- he is his father's son, cynical, secretive, and ruthless, but he is also equally his son's father -- innocent, curious, and affectionate. Framed that way, both his father and his son can be seen as reflections of his own psyche. The reason why he is so blank, so tired and depressed, is that they cancel each other out. By then end of that scene I knew how the movie had to end.The side story involving Neve Campbell isn't very interesting."
4,Good but with faults,"This is actually a fine film; far from first-rate, but a solid 3 on a scale of one to four. The acting is excellent; Macy can do no wrong. But there are shortcomings in the writing. There is gratuitous sex throughout, for example, and the ending is contrived and predictable. Yes, it's film noir. And not at all the ""black comedy"" Maltin describes. In short, this is worth your time, unless you'd rather watch something truly serious or funny."
1,Starts S L O W and only gets S L O W E R. Use as a sleep aid only,Starts S L O W and only gets S L O W E R. Use as a sleep aid only. Seriously this is not even a good time waster if they had it playing at the DMV
3,Surprise! William H Macy leading a life of quiet desperation,"Good cast. No, make that a damn good cast. Lowkey is good, unless a script sucks, which thisdoes. Bill Macy plays his usual ineffectual mid-life crisis sufferer. Donald Sutherland is soeffortless, everyone else pales in comparison.Neve Campbell, while trying to come across termi-nally hip, never received her wakeup call, & sub-sequently snoozes her way through this. BarbaraBain should be content to live on Mission Impos-sible residuals. Tracey Ullman takes on the roleof Macy's wife, but rather than playing it under-stated, as she did here, I wish she'd channeledRayleen Gibson, and fed the screenwriter to herdingo family, or at the very least, to a bark chipper."
2,pointless,"i really like macy but this movie was boring boring boring. Not to mention, i'm supposed to believe in the old hitman with a heart of gold??? also, ending was totally contrived."
5,Part Sopranos Part American Beauty = Great Movie,"After reading a review of this movie in the Boston Herald, I quickly logged on to Amazon.com and ordered this movie. I was not disappointed. Panic is about a hitman (a family business run by his father) played by the great William H Macy who's going through a midlife crisis and wants to quit his job as well. While trying to deal with both of the above issues, Macy's character falls for a young hairdresser played by Neve Cambell. If you like quirky, offbeat movies , pick up Panic today."
4,home run,Superb performances all around--Macy's craft far exceeds his recognition. This film portrays male midlife drama in an agile and quite singular story. The existential child is pure inspiration. Highly recommended.
1,looked great,"To be honest, the item looked great! I loved the whole idea for my 10- year old nephew who is very into war type stuff. He is learning a lot about history in the process. I gave hime the item for Christmas and as soon as he starting playing with it the layers of plaster began chipping away from the edges. I contacted Netgift right away who told me more than a month ago that they would replace the board, but the new board never came and Netgift stopped responding to my e-mails. I would not waste your time or money on this product."
2,Not so good,Does someone else see the flaw in comparing Annual reports with Shakespeare?I agree that jargon is a strangler of communication. I agree that there are significant flaws in the way we communicate. But no solution is proposed. Spare me the extra 140 pages.
1,A terrible waste of time!,"I cannot believe that publisher accepted to bring this book to market. This is a terrible & pointless critic of the language. There is absolutely no substance to this book, only a catchy title! I regret this purchase."
2,Poorly concealed partisanship,"The premise of this book is sound, but as other reviewers have said, it is an unstructured mess. It starts off well enough, but after a few chapters of directionless examples of bad language, one starts to become bored.Then, part way through the book, Watson starts showing his true colours. On page 103 he takes an inoffensive quote from Australia's ex-PM (John Howard), that being ""As a people, we have traditionally engaged the world optimistically. Our open, friendly nature makes us welcome guests and warm hosts"", and then spends the next page arguing that this echoes the propaganda of the Third Reich. Earth to Don: the Nazis wore shoes, but all people who wear shoes aren't Nazis. We know you're a red-hot Labor man and hate Howard's guts, but be a good fellow and keep it out of your book about public language.The book is replete with this type of stuff. Avoid."
2,Mediocre Content Betrays a 5-Star Title,"The author makes excellent points about the wind of pompous, meaningless jargon and deceptive spin that has swept through government, business and academia. I personally trudged through a lot of this muck in the social ""sciences"" and share the author's concern for the erosion of the language. We are losing our ability (or is it will?) to say what we mean in a way that is easy to understand and worth the reader's time.Chapter 1 should be digested by everyone whose job requires them to write or speak. In the beginning I thought the book was a 4; by page 58 I was thinking 3 stars; and by chapter 3 it was in freefall. His own writing bogs down in muddy thinking and poorly chosen examples. I lost sight of his sails as he drifted off point and disappeared in a fog of philosophical opportunism.I still recommend chapter 1, but get it from your library. It's not worth the money."
1,factory direct...terrible,"sent the proper item, but in a different style/finish compared to what was pictured and described per amazon...not worth the hassle of a return, but completely unsatisfied."
4,More than half are good,"I feel that for the most part, this isn't a bad CD. Sure, it's not Sublime, but hearing their music from different artists is very refreshing on most of these tracks. It would be a valid addition to any Sublime collection. It would be more of a supplemental than a mainstay, but every once in awhile, it's nice to hear the songs I'm used to from Sublime with a different beat or spin on it.Give it a shot. You might like it. Sample the mp3's. See if it's something you might enjoy."
1,Tribute Sublime Various Artists,"I consider myself to be a huge Sublime fan. I think this tribute album is a monstrosity to the name of Sublime. The artists on this album took Sublime's songs and absolutely butchered them. Please save your money and stick with the one and only, never can be duplicated SUBLIME. Do not discrace Brad Nowell with the purchase of this garbage."
4,2 out of 3 made it on,This is the first time they confiscated one of the bladders. Carnival is cracking down. I am assuming they found it during a random search but I am not sure. I have never had an issue before.
5,Money Saver,"I used this year on my cruise vacation. Filled it with Bacardi, made sure the cap was on tight and rolled them up in a pair of shorts. No problems whatsoever. When we got off on the islands, namely St. Thomas and Puerto Rico, I brought them along and filled them with the handy little funnel and got back on no problem. Easy to hid. Saved me probably a couple dollars on my drink tab."
4,Tried and True,"As advertised, these heavy-duty plastic containers do exactly what they are touted to do. They are highly recommended! One needn't worry about leakage or durability--they will last a good long time as well."
5,Worked great,"Took it on princess cruise to Hawaii. Worked great. Had no trouble getting on board. Sealed nicely, can't wait to take it to a ball game or another cruise"
5,Not just for cruises,"I originally bought this in anticipation of our cruise after reading all of the reviews, but have used it many times already. It's great for motorcycle trips, baseball games, just about any outdoor activity where you don't want to or can't carry a flask. I'm going to order a couple more of the larger ones for the cruise. FYI, if you lose the cap bottled water caps will work."
5,most comfortable bike saddle?,"Over the last fifty plus years I've sat on a number of bicycle saddles. Hands down I gotta say that the Brooks B17 is the most comfortable I've used. Bicycle saddles mate up with a very personal part of the anatomy and therefore are a very personal decision, but Brooks saddles seem to conform perfectly to provide maximum comfort and to minimum weariness on everything from highly technical trail rides to long road rides."
1,Doesn't suit me,"I have a Brooks B17 Special and a Brooks Special Flier (bought together in a fit of expectant optimism). I have done around 10,000 miles on one or the other, so they should be reasonably broken in. On my typical ride to work (typically just less than 1hour - 13.5 miles), I ride for 8 minutes, then get a pain on the insides of my upper thighs. I need to come off the saddle until the pain subsides, then it is OK for a while. I sometimes suffer numbness in places where I'd prefer that not happen!The Special Flier is better, but still not good.I have now removed the B17 from the bike, and am trying a Selle San Marco Rolls - have only done one ride to work on it, so I can't make a comparison, but I really don't like the Brooks - disappointing. I was determined to like those saddles, but I don't."
2,Wouldn't read any more from him,"I recall liking ""Outposts"" and ""Fracture Zone"" though it's been a while. ""Korea"", however, was the end of line for me. Winchester makes a repeated point of how popular he is among South Koreans by virtue of his being English; that was snotty enough by the third go-round. What did me in was the time he arrived at a U S base, browbeat them into letting him stay there (when they didn't have to), and then proceeded to trash just about every single U S military person he ran across after accepting their hospitality. He also had a penchant for running into anti-American Koreans; you'd think they were rife, along with all of the many prostitutes throwing themselves at him. Oh yeah, there was one old soldier, fawningly pro-British, as though the U K had been the ones who saved South Korea.Yes, there's well-researched history here, hence a second star. Not worth purchasing new. If you can't find a used copy, get it from the library."
2,A promising start but a drag towards the end,"I picked up this book for its interesting cover- the pairs of shoes seem so inviting- asking the reader to take a glimpse into the mystical land of Korea. That was a promising start but the read soon became a drag. The author tends to describe scenaries (perhaps because he walked for the journey)with too much details and there are not many facades of Korean life that are well-depicted. There is insufficient insight into why Koreans are different from the Japanese and the Chinese, though all 3 great nations are so close to one another.For an Asian who would probably know Korea an bit more than fellow readers from the Western world, I do not find this book entertaining at all. The saving grace was perhaps some history of the development of hangul, the Korean language and the different types of ginseng. That's about it."
3,Walking through Korea,A well written book with many first-hand experiences by the author as he walked through Korea following the historic route. This book is a bit outdated by now for those who are familiar with Korea in 2010.
1,Was This Written by Someone Else With the Same Name?,"There remain very few books of Simon Winchester's that I have not yet read. Happily, I can say that I have loved his interesting and insightful looks at plate tectonics, China, the OED, San Francisco, Krakatoa, Joseph Needham, so when I began the Korea book, I expected to be thoroughly engrossed. What a disappointment! It seems as if an aide ghost wrote it for him. The outlook is that of an overeager teenage boy about to enter his first house of ill repute, in fact this becomes so boring, it is difficult to finish the book. Winchester judges all Americans by the servicemen whom he meets at the bars and bordellos, well all except for one literate officer. Sorry, I cannot say anything more positive about this book.This was a total waste of money and of time - his, mine and anyone, who reads it."
4,Well written; the way to learn about another country!,"This book is well written and full of factual information. The stories descriping his travels include those things of every day life: eating, sleeping, contentment,humor, nature, people and more. I bought the book as a gift to a family member living & working in South Korea because after our visit to South Korea I realized just how much I'd learned reading Mr. Winchester's account of his travels."
2,An arrogant westerner's view of Korea,"This book details the author's walking tour in South Korea in the late 80's. Though tidbits of interesting historical and cultural facts are included, they were written in a disorganized and anecdotal manner. Occasionally careless statements about the Koreans and Asians were made, clearly with exaggeration or overgeneralization.Though the author said he loved Korea, what stands out page after page is the superiority complex he displayed for the land and the people. He mocked their age-old customs and current undertakings and gave proud accounts of his own bad behavior during his travel. The air of arrogance and condescension exudes from every single line. I am not a Korean, but even I am offended. The author obviously fails to understand that not everybody regards Kendal Mint Cake the best thing since sliced bread."
2,soul in the ice,"Not a great album,but at the price not bad.Makes you feel like Christmas and slightly Motown nostalgic.Does include the Drifters unique ""White Christmas"" and a handful of other nice cuts,including a moving,straight version of ""Auld Lang Syne"".Not ideal for real shaboom-shaboom lovers,as most songs are in a fairly straightforward style."
3,"Love the look and that they're made in Germany, but they chip!","I've had these bowls for a couple years now. I was excited to find bowls that weren't made in China, and I love the way they look. They're colored in cheery, bright, saturated hues, and eating my cereal in them perks me up a little in the morning. But now, nearly every one has at least one chip on the rim. I don't think I'm particularly careless with them - they go in the dishwasher and get otherwise normal use. Maybe that's to be expected, but I'm disappointed. For the price I'd hoped they would last longer. If I could find other bowls this nice that weren't made in China, I'd give them a try."
3,Average,"If you are a die hard Concorde fan like I am this may be a little disappointing. I was hoping for some new facts, or even history but the story is really about the decommissioning of the Concorde and handing over G-BOAD to the intrepid museum. It's worth a look but nothing mind blowing."
1,to the Intrepid,"This dvd almost does`nt say a thing about about building the concorde, it just tells you the story of the concordes last trip to new york, and then moving it to the intrepid. It really does not tell the history of the actuall concorde, try different dvd`s on this topic."
4,"this one's good, but the mower one is more fun","I bought one of these for my son, and it's a good toy, pretty easy to put together, fun to ride, but we also got him one of the Mower Ride-Ons,Lil' Buddys My First Mow It Tractor Ride Onand he LOVES that one! From an adult perspective, they're practically the same toy, but the riding mower has grass that flies around on the back in a little attachment, and he LOVES to pretend he's mowing the yard like his father. They're both good toys, but I'd recommend the tractor ride on more."
2,not worth the money,this toy is a lot smaller than it seemed. By the time the kids have the skills to use it they have out grown it.
5,Steve Jobs an Original Life,"Suzan Wilson's book, Steve Jobs, Wizard of Apple Computer is an amazing read about an amazingly original man. Ms. Wilson's book tells Steve Jobs story in a most readable writing style. The reader is constantly made aware of Mr. Jobs climb from early teenage rebel to successful computer inventor. This finely researched book is an excellent read and would be a great addition to eveyone's library. Especially those of us- all of us who have computers! Buy it!"
4,Great summary of the start of the Gay Movement,"This documentary includes interviews, film clips and key news items of the progression of the gay movement since Stonewall. As a member of the GLBT community and a PFLAG chapter president, I found the documentary very informative. I recommend this documentary as a follow-up to ""Before Stonewall""."
5,AFTER STONEWALL,"I HAVE NOT WATCHED THE FILM YET, BUT IT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND APPEARS TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. THANKS, CARLA"
2,Intriguing but ultimately frustrating,"This movie is about Dora Carrington's love life, and is effective in exploring it. Hoever, for those of us who knew of her as an artist and wanted to know more, it is disappointing. Her paintings don't even make it into the film until the final credits, where they seem to beckon one into a fascinating story that the film never told. Why did Carrington paint? What was in her heart and mind? How could a movie about an artist completely neglect her art? It doesn't tell the whole story at all. I was upset and annoyed at this. It's a pattern I've seen all too often, when the people making the movie seem more interested in who an artist or writer slept with than why and how they became great artists in the first place.Emma Thompson gives the best performance I think anyone could have under the circumstances, but she (and Carrington) deserved a better script. I never felt as if I knew Carrington, because the art that meant so much to her was not part of the film."
1,Definitely a Contender,"This film is definitely a contender for the worst film of all time. At the very least its in the top ten. Emma Thompson is a fine actress, perhaps one of the best of her generation, but even she can't make Dora Carrington interesting. Similarly to the much under-rated Jennifer Jason Leigh failed to ignite Dorothy Parker and the Vicious Circle, Thompson just can't make this film take off. Ultimately it is a film about the private lives of two boring, self-absorbed artists. There isn't much for the audience here and even a patient viewer won't be rewarded by the acting. Fine acting without a story is a bit like wine without a bottle. Ultimately just a waste. I gave it one star, and I think that's fair, after all it did have one star: Emma Thompson. Pity she wasn't given any real dramatic material to shine with."
1,Painful,"My aunt made me watch this horrible movie during a visit. It may have caused permanent brain damage. At the movie's midpoint I declared, ""I hope everyone dies tragic, pain filled deaths"". One of the only good things about this movie is that my wish was granted."
1,Some things are better left dead!,"As a huge fan of all involved I must at least give one star for presentation. The fact that I actually had some type of interest in Carrington is beyond my comprehension. This movie should not be entitled Carrington. It should be entitled ""Can a Woman be More Screwed Up in the Head?"" If you are looking to find the answers to why Ms. Carrington's personality did not follow the norm, you will not find the answer in this movie. If you looking for a sexually, morbidly confused bunch of self absorbed, self-destructive artists, you have a winner with Carrington. (i.e. when Mr. Strachey is first introduced in the movie he spots Carrington by saying ""Who is that lovely young boy?"" Where I come from people can get arrested for comments like that!)This movie will not uplift or encourage you. It will not make you a more socially or artistically aware individual. You may, however, feel sick after wasting two hours of your life as I did."
4,A valid confirmation,"This was a very enjoyable rendition of some difficult material to turn into a movie, despite the interesting lives it portrays. A stronger script would have made it even better, but realistically speaking, the characters must have written and painted better than they spoke - we know that much of creative people! A touching and memorable indication of the fact that even people full of talent and potential can lead lives of infinite sadness and confusion. More could have been made of Carrington's art, in a visual work such as this, I felt. The subtle use of the famous Strachey portrait was well done.All in all, a touching rendition made poignant by the excellent casting and marvellous locations. Costuming too was very good."
4,Well written and well acted.,"This is a beautifully morose story of painter Dora Carrington; her work, her life, and the love of her life, author Lytton Strachey, who also happens to be homosexual. It is set in World War One England, and it looks as though the film itself could be a work of art. Carrington is full of saturated green landscapes and poetic dialog. Though a bit of a ""downer"", still worth a box of Kleenex and a month's prescription of Prozac."
3,Pity about the Nyman soundtrack,"Here is a competent film which focuses on the unusual Bloomsbury relationship between Carrington and Strachey between the Great war and 1932.The two principals are exceptionally fine, especially Pryce as Strachey whose movement, mannerisms and acerbic gentleness establish wonderfully this memorable eccentric. Several supporting roles are capably done.Unfortunately I found the film seriously undermined by Michael Nyman's music, which is obtrusive, jagged and insistently repetitive. On three occasions it makes way for the supremely beautiful slow movement of the Schubert string quintet, but the aural abuse returns each time, including during the credits.music"
3,"A nice glove, but way too big.","I realize that I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth but -The gloves were included in my order for a chainsaw (over $100), but they are available in XL only. Something a little smaller would be useful. I don't feel safe wearing these monsters."
3,need different sizes,These gloves seem to work fine but are a bit long in the fingers for me. It would be nice to have a smaller size.
1,15 minutes is all you need,"A one dimensional film, if you are interested in a better experience try the film wasteland. This documentary if you can call it a documentary never goes beyond the superficial life of a few bottle collectors with no connection as to who they are beyond buying and selling plastic bottles and sometimes cooper wire for recycle.The documentary is filmed using dated interlaced video, normally up close which separates the viewer from the city and you never get a sense of compassion for any of the characters. If you watch the trailer - you just saw the complete documentary, nothing moves beyond that. Keep your money for something else."
4,CD,"CD is krunk fo' sho' Don't really like the death metal growlin' stuff. Not dissin' on that kinda stuff if that's what ur into, just sayin' it aint fa me. Good effin' CD though. I like it, you don't have to. No denying the guitar though. Don't even try."
2,It made me CRY!,"How could they slaughter All Nerids Beware so bad??????????????? The music video song is perfect, i LOVED it. But they dont have it on this they take all their expiremental parts and just go with safe emo. Like when he says ""To the girl who cant forgive me."" I was so mad i couldnt even listen to the rest of the album. If they didnt try to be so safe, it would be good. Thats why i gave it 2 stars, it had the potential to be a GREAT album, but unfortunely they care too much about not being different and safe, they ruined it. come on chiodos. By the way, you say it CHEE-O-DOS, not CII-OO-DUS like some idiot at their concert. bleeh"
2,eh; the piano's pretty.,"""All's Well that Ends Well"" really is a melting pot of many sounds, but the resultant stew is a disappointment. This album was recommended to me by a few friends, one of which is very much into the hardcore scene. I must say I wasn't expecting such whiny vocals, juvenille lyrics, and repetetive techniques(vocalist speaking ""dramatically"" during breakdowns). I was initially taken in by and enjoyed tho opening piano and continuing keyboards throughout the album and some of the guitar riffs are impressive and were enjoyable; but overall, this album was a disappointment. They deffinitely seem like the average case of MTV-brand emo/screamo.oh, and uh....what's up with the album art???"
3,All is not Well with Chiodos,"In the midst of all the factory produced Screamo bands, its nice to see a little variation: key word being 'little.' With sometimes off key and frightening Oragan sounds (think Cursive) and Something Corporates Grand Piano sounds in the mix, Chiodos has made an intersting mix of post hardcore, emo, screamo, and piano tones all together.Although piano and synth may be what your looking for, if you want an indepth interesting musical collaboration, this isn't it.However when Chiodos stops trying to fit in, and starts letting loose, with its many breakdowns and solo singing, it can be truly powerful. (as with song #4, when the singer bellows out, ""TILL MY LAST BREATH TAKES YOU FROM ME"").all in all an okay record, with some definate highs, and many lows."
2,$$$,"Glad I got to see these guys play back when their name was still The Chiodos Bros, before getting signed to Equal Vision and changing their sound from early years of The Blood Brothers to just plain Hot Topic material. But you have to give them this much; I would've done it to for the $."
1,It wasn't a good movie.,I didn't really like it. I don't like how they draw the people. It looks stupid. The plot wasn't really good. There was only about a couple of minutes of actually good action in the first episode of the tape. Thats what I think about it. You might actually like it. I'm just saying that I'm never going to watch Blue Seed again.
5,Excellent guide to restoring Antique Bisque dolls......,"This is a book that I will keep close at hand as I work on the Antique Bisque dolls to restore them to their original beauty! So complete in all areas of restoration with clear directions and wonderful pictures. It is just like having Mary there with you to personally guide your hands! Without hesitation, I give it 5 big stars!!!"
4,Great Dictionary,This is a fantastic dictionary. It's only flaw is that it is a little bit dated and does not have the most recent slang. Otherwise it is a fantastic tool!
5,Great tape for Achilles Tendinitis!,"I am a gymnast with achilles tendinitis, and I love this tape because it practically gives me a new achiles"
2,BAD LOCATION FOR TAG!! Design flaw,"Great color & fabric, but when I pulled off the little white tag that tells the content & washing instructions, etc., it ripped the hem open. That's a very dumb design flaw."
3,Mega Mix Craft,"This blender craft/pitcher/container fits the Mega Mix too. the blender is great and the 48oz. craft works great but! after about 1 year the wagon wheel on the bottom of the cutter assembly will strip and sheer off. this is the 3rd craft i've purchased and they all do the same thing. i make smoothies every day with ice, frozen fruit, milk and protein powder. no matter what order you put the ingredients into the craft it blends perfectly but after a while the torque takes it's toll. the cutter assembly in the bottom of the craft cost just as much as the whole container so i just bought two so i have another as a backup.while i love the blender, the week point is the rubber drive coupler and wagon wheel. in the future i would buy a blender that uses an all metal drive coupling! ! !if you have one of these blenders try to buy the crafts when someone has them on sale and order a back up because you'll need it eventually if you plan to keep the blender."
3,Must like action figures,I bought this for my autistic 9 year old child who's an avid Harry Potter fan. He wasn't interested and neither were my other two boys. Best to buy for girls maybe or HP collectors. The toy does look like Harry.
4,Great chair,"I purchased this chair for just under $60 and after doing some research I found out its worth at least $270 anywhere else. It's a very heavy and sturdy chair, almost seems indestructible. The only downside is its a little hard on the behinde and that's why I gave it a 4 stare."
2,Unjustified,"It is a recommended reading in my postgraduate study of cross-cultural management. It has covered basic management principles such as communication process and organisational structure. However, the problem is that when readers have to pay GBP35 to buy this book, they deserve to learn more."
4,Wealth of insights,The book has a great wealth of insights. It is an excellent guidebook for international managers and also provides a well of ideas for researchers.
4,Grand Hotel is Procol's true grand finale.,"Taking one last shot at the aural grandeur of their early masterpieces (Shine On Brightly, A Salty Dog, etc.), Procol actually manages to pull it off one last time. With Hammond organ firmly back in the forefront on most cuts, Matthew Fisher would have fit right in on this LP. Stately epics like the title cut, TV Caesar and Fires Which Burnt Brightly evoke all the dark mystery and unique ambience of Procol past. With this newly revamped lineup, the band would go on to record three more mostly forgettable albums before finally calling it a day. But Grand Hotel is the one, last shining hour of a once-great band."
4,Souvenir of London,"Some people think this song is about drug-smuggling, but I suggest you review the lyrics again. It's actually about an STD, gonorrhea to be specific. The news is ""leaking out""...and it isn't going to shrink? What might leak under certain conditions? Why is he concerned about his souvenir not shrinking? Could it be something has swollen? Is it not possible he wouldn't want his Mum to know he's been with a prostitute?Everyone's entitled to their own interpretation, as long as they're satisfied with it, but I'll stick by mine."
3,"Good, But Not Their Best","Most other reviewers seem to love this album, but I did not find it to be one of PH's better works. I rarely listened to it on LP and the CD hasn't made it any more appealing. This is one of those albums that was good enough not to get rid of but one that rarely got played because there was always something better to listen to.I think this was PH's attempt at intellectual rock and I guess if you are a lyric listener, there may be some deep and interesting writing here. But the sound is my main concern. It is a huge ""wall of sound"" studio orchestrated work that allows little time for the great organ or guitar work or rawer sound of earlier works (or what can be found next time out on the first half of Exotic Birds and Fruit). Don't get me wrong, this album has some good stuff on it, but it just doesn't flow with the force of several other of their releases."
4,Pretty cool!,"Neat gaget, but needs full sunshine to work. Would be great to distract young kids for you Moms out there.Shipped and packaged nicely."
5,Rainbow maker,I love this product Placed in a sunny window rainbows flit about the ceiling and walls and lift ones mood
5,great xmas gift,sent this little gem to my sister-in-law and she LOVED it!!! She said she danced around her kitchen for 20 minutes until the sun disappeared. Thanks for making my gift giving so easy!
5,KIKKERLAND SOLAR-POWERED DOUBLE RAINBOW MAKER,"AN UNUSUAL DEVICE THAT LIGHTS UP THE ROOM IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. SEEING THE MOVING RAINBOWS, LETS EVERYONE KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A SUNNY DAY."
4,Rainbow maker,"Good quality, beautiful rainbows, well constructed. worth the money. I gave away 6 of them last Xmas and they were huge hits."
4,Awesome,"This is a great item! Beware that the sun has to directly hit it. They only workout house during the summer because that's when our windows get hit with direct sun light, but very pretty when they work."
4,Rainbow maker,"It works as advertised, however the rainbows are very small, not much more that little spots on the wall. The spots do dance around in a lively manner."
5,enjoyable,The rainbow maker throws rainbows on the walls. They move as the solar energized crystals rotate. My cats used to love to chase them until they finally figured out they can't catch rainbows.
5,Perfect!,This is a gift for some friends and it's exactly what I wanted. I have a single rainbow maker and the double will me twice as nice for them!
5,Rainbow magic! :),"All of Kikkerland's solar-powered rainbow makers are pure magic!Find a sunny window to power the motor and the crystals spin while the sun shines on that spot. It breaks the light into gorgreous rainbow fragments onto the walls throughout the room.Built well, clever design and fascinating to watch!Pure beauty and magic with a touch of whimsy!! :)"
1,"Gears stripped on 3 of these, single version better","I really like the single crystal version of this, but all 3 of the double rainbow makers I own have developed a ""clicking"" as the gears have stripped. (All 3 are Kikkerland). The single version has been trouble free and I have owned them for over 2 years."
2,Quits easily,"Kikkerland Window-Mount Solar-Powered Heart Rainbow MakerI have this rainbow maker. I also have a double rainbow maker and gave two others like this as gifts. I was totally embarassed when the receiver of the gift said it only worked a week or so and then quit! My double rainbow maker worked for a couple of months and then it quit also. Bummer. I see some of the gears working in mine, but don't know how to get into it and/or how to fix it. I should think the manufacturer would remedy this problem since I am not the only one to complain. The concept of rainbows filling the rooms is totally wonderfu and the price a bit spendy to be so disappointing. Hoping somewhere there are simple directions a little old grandma can understand so I can fix them. I would buy more of them if that were the case."
5,Very cool,I have 3 of these in my house. I love the rainbows everywhere. It brings happiness and peace to me.
5,really adds something to a room,I love this. It has never fallen and I've had it since this summer. It has every time added to my mood in a positive way. I am more mindful and stop to be in the moment when I am in the same room. It is a therapeutic distraction for me. It is an asset to the room it serves and I would be very disappointed to lose it. It is well worth the money to me.
2,Ride On,"bought this on sale(less than [...]shipped I think) and for that it was possibly worth it-anymore and Id be miffed-its not durable,its cheaply made and just doesnt warrant paying full price.I bought 2 of differing looks and for an [..] itll do for easy inside play but if you have a child who will play on it alot and is very active I would definitely steer clear."
1,Thw worst JAK I have ever read,"This is the worst JAK's novel I have read. Only the writers you love a lot can disappoint you so much. It is very out-of-date. I can hardly believe there are contemporary readers that like this novel. York is a dominant male, arrogant and so prepotent that sometimes he verges on violence, not considering just for one second what the heroine, Selena, thinks, hopes or believes. And she is so weak! and inconstant: first she cannot stand his arrogance, and suddenly (the morning after...- she loves him. He says terrible sentences like: I want you, I will have you, give yourself to me. And she: her mouth says no, but her body says yes - which has always remembered me of rape. Sex, even in romantic novels, is something two enjoy, it is not something one gives and the other one takes as a hunting piece."
5,Great all purpose kicks,"My son has been wearing this same style of Adidas sneaker for several years...they stand up well to gym time and outside wear and look decent with jeans or khakis. He has the ""gym sneakers become outside sneakers"" rotation going on, so he's always got at least 2 pair on the go...they're just a classic."
4,Dirty Mary Crazy Larry / Race With The Devil (Double Feature),"Very Decent Price for a Double Pack movie. Movies were really good, never seen them before but they were recommended by a friend. Good recommendation!!"
2,"Great Movie, but....!","But the quality of the DVD was poor. It skipped, and froze first day out of the box, in a brand new DVD player, so....., that is not good business. I guess 1 out of 3 is not bad:)"
3,Great way to kill a Saturday,"This is a review of the SHOUT FACTORY! DVD release of the DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY/RACE WITH THE DEVIL double-feature.Not ashamed to admit I had never heard of DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY before seeing the oft-maligned DEATH PROOF (which I very much enjoy the shorter theatrical cut of). I got what I was expecting here... a quirky, action-packed car chase flick with some terrific vehicular stunt sequences.RACE WITH THE DEVIL is less action-packed but I found it to be nearly as entertaining as the other flick in this double-feature. The ever-so-cool Warren Oates kept this one afloat, and the 70's-centric use of a satanic cult as the antagonists made this a fun, goofy watch.This stuff isn't CITIZEN KANE, but if you're looking for a cheap way to kill three hours or so then this is a pretty good deal."
5,Old Favorites,"Blast from the Past, these are goodies from our youth. Bought this for Race with the Devil, then we were bored one rainy afternoon and watched the Mary/Larry movie. Pleasantly surprised by this. NO computer-special effects. Who'd a thunk action movies could have real, live action?"
4,Multi-bowl,"These are the perfect size bowls. I've used them for pot pies, cereal, soups. dishwasher safe. It does chip if you bang it so handle with care."
3,I was hoping for more...,"This was not one of Truman's best books. I kept waiting for some action and mystery... and then it did not come. The other Capital Crimes book I read most recently (Murder at the Smithsonian; Library of Congress) had a lot more intrigue. I did like the many DC references, but those are in all of her books... hopefully Ms. Truman will have some better books to offer in the future."
3,First-time Truman reader,"This is my first encounter with a Margaret Truman mystery; I choose this audio book after reading her obituary. I did enjoy the experience overall - she had a very engaging writing style. There are spot-on descriptions of characters that fall into classic archetypes. And the book is full of rich detail on the Washington and arts milieu. I especially appreciated how facts about Lincoln's life and death were made relevant through various characters. However, I found the story itself serviceable; there were several plausible suspects to keep me guessing, but not much action or twists."
5,Excellent addition!,"Yes, it does remind one of the sorry scandal in Washington concerning Chandra Levy, and it makes one think these things still go on. No one ever learns....... Ms Truman is a reliable author, I alway enjoy her books. This one kept me reading and losing sleep in order to get to the solution. Many educational tidbits also given.A very worthwhile read and I remain a devoted reader of all her books. I am anxious to see where the next crime scene will take place. Surely, not the Botanical Gardens! :D"
3,"Decent book, but not a necessity if you want to teach overseas",I bought this before going to teach in Spain. It was helpful to an extent but I learned more talking to people and doing online research. Definitely recommend getting a used version at least to save a buck or two.
3,A good book - but only for Brits!,"Griffith's book is a very valuable resource for British or Britain-based teachers. However, it is not really very useful for Americans and other non-Brits. because a lot of the information is irrelevant or even misleading to non-EU citizens. For example, the book devotes too much space to jobs in Western Europe and not enough to areas where non-EU citizens can work legally, such as Latin America. It also concentrates on recruitment organizations and school groups which insist on teachers being interviewed in England. So I think Americans and Canadians should look for books which more directly address their job needs. One possibility is Jeff Mohammed's ""Teaching English Overseas."" It's shorter, partly because it has fewer ads and anecdotes, but it has more relevant information. There may be other similar book also."
1,Reprint is Too Small - Can Not Read It,"This paper back reprint version is too small and almost impossible to read. Although the physical size of the paper is 5 1/2"" by 8 1/2"", the actual size of the photo copied page is only 2"" by 4"". More then 50% of the physical page is blank. Hard to read, drill diagrams blur together. It is not worth the $6.45 price and I am returning it."
4,OK,"this is ok, u only get about 675 shots from this tank before refilling it. the company that makes this tank is also good.u get about 75 shots per ounce (i think) so for the price of this u should spend the extra money and get a 20 oz. tank."
2,defective,The first time filling the container it worked fine. The second refill leaked out before we got home. The people at Academy said there was a defect with it.
4,Hilarious!,"It's several years since I read this book, and you might wonder what someone from the north of England can understand about life in the deep South- a lot more, having read this book! Florence King has a wicked view of life, and expresses herself in the most hilarious way. You might not wish to read this in public- along with Paul Rudnick's wonderful ""I'll Take It"", this is one of the funniest boooks out there!"
2,Not up to par,"It would seem that after King wrote a best seller, she lost interest in recording relevant events of her childhood & concentrated on her lack of morals. Did not get beyond third chapter."
2,Not that thrilled by this book,I was rather bummed by this read after all those fabulous reviews. I found it to drag on and on! I did not think it was humorous or ingenious. I just wasn't blown away and I had so hoped it would. This southern transplant needed some downhome nostalgia but came up empty handed.
4,Sensitive and self-aware,"As a feminist and a believer in the individual, I loved this book. Florence King is an intellectual in the best sense of the world, funny and erudite, never shying away from either the very coarse or the very fine. My favorite passage describes her first day in kindergarten, her first time in the company of other children her age (she was an only child). ""I was miserable.... Worse, it appeared that I was a child too. I hadn't known this before; I thought I was just short."""
3,Confessions is eerily true!,"I am truly a southerner, and Ms. King's irreverant approach to the traditions and ways of the south in the mid-twentieth century are so on target that it will startle the reader who is not from the south, and will sound all to familiar to the southern reader.I found her covert feminism during this time in her life very interesting and educational. It almost seemed like the fact that she was a feminist during this time in her life was unknown to even herself.Her honest talk about her sexual life I found startling.The way she challenged the cultural norms of that time is educational for anyone who is living under a cloud of opression, real or just real to you.it's a great read!"
3,"Funny, but not the best of the 3","I liked this book, not as much as the first two, but still a great read. I laughed, I cried, and then I laughed some more. Dan, write me another one please. I need mirth. I need guileless innuendo. I need to be caught off guard so I almost snort milk out my nose when I read a really funny description.Perhaps this isn't the best one of the trilogy, it is still a good read. Read the first two, absolutely, but don't leave this one out. You will laugh, and it is worth the time."
2,The worst of the series,"""Dirty Work"", the story of an unwilling hero, is a disappointment. Dan McGirt's first two books about Jason Cosmo are funny and entertaining, but with his third book, he fails to continue what had been a winning trend. His tongue-in-cheek humor goes over the top, with the characters being far too aware that they are in a story, and his best supporting character, Mercury Boltblaster, only appears in a small portion of the book. Read the first two books, but skip this one. It's not worth the money."
2,over the top and trite,"The highlight of this book for me was the reference to the Luggage of terry pratchett's discworld novels.The book was slightly funny in parts, but it lacked the spark that would have truly made it a funny satire/parody. It had the characters ""break the fourth wall"" entirely too many times and then had them go right back to what they were doing, as nothing had happened. IF they had made fun of the roles (which they did) and then proceeded to do something completely unexpected or at least original, it would have been funnier. But as it is, they did the equivalent of: saying, ""I'm going to step right here without paying attention and slip on a banana peel, to humorous effect,"" and then doing so. It just isn't funny.For a few pages, half way through, I thought maybe it would break away from this and be fresh and original for two minutes, but no luck."
5,DRAW REAL PEOPLE,"THIS BOOK IS EASY TO USE AND UNDERSTAND, WHICH I FIND MOST HELPFUL. THE STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ARE EASY TO FOLLOW AND THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR EITHER A BEGINNER OR AS A HELPFUL REFRESHER. THE TECHNIQUES ARE PROFESSIONAL AND INFORMATIVE AS YOU GO ALONG."
4,Not for people who dream to draw great pictures,This was a useful book for me. I learned my basics from it. I took a star away because the tecnicuesare neither artistic nor proffesional. It isnt for people who want to create something *great*.
4,A Very Impressive Method for Drawing Portraits,"I am a complete drawing novice, not having picked up a pencil since grade school. At first, I thought that this book was too hard for a beginner, but I kept coming back to it. I haven't been able to reproduce the amazing artwork showcased in the book, but I was able to significantly improve. The big secret is to draw less with the pencil and smudge and blend more with the tortillion (paper stump). If I had more time, I think I could get even better, but even with the little time I had, I was impressed with the method. So I think this book is great, but it takes some time to begin to ""get"" it. If you're looking for easy wins or something for young children, I'm not sure that this is a great start, but with some time and effort, this method can really work."
3,"Not for beginners (real, beginners!)","Based on the recommendations I decided to give this book a shot.I am a dabbler in most everything, and have recently picked up drawing again...this book, has nice pictures of faces and up-close and personal body parts (like ears, and noses) it's not for the raw artists. There's a surprising lack of step-by step on how-to-, where to draw each part of the body and so forth. They have only a few samples with the steps drawn in; I'd love to have more pointers!!And, it should be titled, ""How to draw the head profile"" instead of ""How to draw real people"", since the author did not include how to draw human figure, hands, arms, etc.however, it's still a helpful guide in giving the basic knowledge of how to draw the human face."
4,Bought it as a gift,Bought as a gift for my girlfriend's little sister and she loved it! She had problems drawing hands so i hope this could help her
3,Entertaining Villans...,"A pretty good movie. Nowhere near the scale of the original, ""Aladdin"", of course, but it's not made as a major theatrical release, so I didn't expect as much. Iago's character is showcased well. Animation quality and songs are acceptable, but nothing really great. Entertaining for children, ages 5-12."
5,The Kobayashi Report,"I don't know why but I can vaguely remember the day that I first have seen this movie. That VSH is lost, but at some point my mother got me the DVD. I really was happy. I love these kind of movies."
4,Really Like the Songs,"The story line is okay, but I really like the music better than the original Aladdin."
3,Good Enough for Direct -to-Video Release,"While this was probably one of the better Direct-to-video releases Disney produced - it was *far* from memorable. Bringing Jafar back seemed like some sort of cop-out - as if there were no other villans or adventures to chase. It played out like a gigantic episode from the TV series (which I also remember watching, but not with any kind of fervor.)And somehow, creating a sequel for Aladdin felt cheap - it was a feeling I couldn't rid myself of during the entire film."
2,"The other two are great, this one mediocre","We rank this 27 out of the 41 Disney Animated movie that we own. It is also the highest rated 2 star movie. The other aladdin movies were popular with sons and daughters alike. This one was only watched by my youngest son, and not very often.Even on the Amazon sales ranking of 18000 puts this one 39 out of the 41. This is only for completist that want the entire trilogy. The original Aladdin and Aladdin King of Thieves are both much better movies."
2,Disney's 1st direct-to-video feature a lackluster affair,"You would think that the sequel to ALADDIN would resolve the cliffhanger of the first film and be just as entertaining and memorable at the same time? Well, you may find yourself a little disappointed.THE RETURN OF JAFAR does tie up loose ends, but the animation and overall plot are almost lifeless. One or two of the songs are good. But it is mainly the performances of some of the film's stars that are able to keep the action flowing, including the return of Gilbert Gottfried as Iago the parrot. But Robin Williams, who was at odds with Disney at the time, is missed as the voice of the Genie. I'm not sure if he would have been able to improve on the weak premise of this sequel, but it probably would've helped it earn at least one or two more stars.THE RETURN OF JAFAR is recommended only to those who liked ALADDIN enough to want to collect the entire trilogy."
2,Caucophony of annoying showtunes,"Do you like showtunes? How about showtunes sung by Gilbert Gottfried who is responsible for the voice of Iago? He makes Danny Devito sound like Luciano Pavarotti. Whoever wrote this movie obviously wanted to write broadway musicals but got stuck writing a low budget, sequel that Disney apparently quickly churned out to make a few extra bucks.Unless you are a fan of big bands, showtunes, and terrible singing by a ghastly cartoon parrot, I say avoid this movie at all costs. Stick to Aladdin part I!This movie does have many features, such as awful singing, annoying big bands with Jaffar and Iago dancing around and singing in their cartoonish, distorted voice. I issue you this stern warning, if you buy this movie for your kids, they will watch it again and again, and you will unwittingly and gradually LEARN the words to about a dozen poorly written show tunes with Gilbert Gottfried of all people shrieking out the lyrics."
2,Dissapointing...,"I just purchased the video today, and I'm sad to say that it was a huge dissapointment. The first thing that caught my eye was that the animation lacked the elegance present in the first movie. Very ''Saturday-morning-cartoon-like''. That aside, the plot was remarkably weak. I kept waiting for the ''BOOM'' to come in. It didn't. Another huge dissapointment were the songs, wich had no meaning for me, it seemed as if they were just written in to prolong the movie. I definately think this sequel could have been done better, but that's just my opinion."
1,Yet another terrible Disney sequel...,"I loved the first Aladdin movie, it's a classic. The sequel's ok because I love Iago, but Disney didn't offer Robing Williams enough cash to do the sequel-so there's a big loss. Little kids might like this- but not adults who are into the ""classic"" movies. Yet again, Disney wastes time dishing out another sequel that sucks. I suggest getting Simba's Pride: LK 2, even that's more entertaining."
1,The horror of it all!,"It always happens to the best of them, movies that is. I just can't understand why Disney is so fixed on making a sequil for everyone of their movies that was actually good. I thought it stunk, if you haven't already guessed. I noticed a considerable difference in the art, for the worst. Also they didn't get Robin Williams for the genie, which is a good thing because I would hate to see him distroy his good reputation with something like this."
1,sent it back to Disney,"This was so bad I sent it back to Disney & got a replacement (different title) video of equal value. (They do that within 30 days if you read the guarantee.) Horrible story & even worse animation mistakes & little background depth. It does, however, make you appreciate the great work in so many of the other Disney classics! I'm happy to say we've only sent back 3 videos in 9 years... Disney has done much better with their made for video movies in the last 2 years. Most any other Disney movie will delight your kids!"
3,Not Bad Direct to Video.,"Aladdin (Voiced by Scott Weinger), The Genie (Replacing Robin Williams and Voiced by Dan Castellaneta), Ago (Voiced by Frank Welker) and Jasmine (Voiced by Linda Larkin) thought it was the last time, they will see Jafar (Voiced by Jonathan Freeman). Jafar`s Pet-Lago (Voiced by Gilbert Gottfried) has reach the surface of the Desert but leaving Jafar inside the lamp. When a bunch of thieves lead by Abis Mal (Voiced by Jason Alexander) has relase Jafar from the lamp and Now Jafar is going to have his revenge with Aladdin.Directed by Tad Stones (Aladdin & The King of Thieves) made This is a Direct to Video sequel is Cheaply made but it`s a cross between Saturday Cartoon morning and Animated film. Animation is not as great as the Original but It`s still has it charms. Grade:B-."
1,"didnt like the quality of pics,songs anre annoying","well no body from the family liked the movie at all , the picture quality is horrible and songs were no good, worthless story i wish i didn't buy"
3,Weaker sophmore,"This film is okay at best. They say that typical sequels are a lot weaker than the original, which in this case this is exactly the case. I thought it'd be a lot better than it was. Disappointing. Buyer beware."
3,"poorly done movie, but good service","Absolutely ugly movie. Cheaply done. The story is bad, faces of the characters are deformed and all over is not worth of watching. But the seller provided a good service.Came on time in a proper package."
2,Aladdin's got a big mouth in the sequal,"Why did the original end with them engaged to be married but the sequel only has them living together? It seems disney tried too hard on this one. For one, Homer Simpson as the voice of the genie ruined it. The only thing that keeps this movie afloat is Jason Alexander as Abis Mohl."
3,This Lisa Gardner is not THE Lisa Gardner,"..and I have not read the book..so I cannot rate it really...I almost bought this book since I am a fan of murder mysteries..but this book is NOT THE Lisa Gardner who wrote The Perfect Husband, Gone, etc. that I adore..Amazon apparently thinks this Lisa is THE Lisa...but read the info on the author and you will see it is NOT...so don't be fooled. But if you wish to buy this book for its own content, please do so."
3,NOTE: Treads easily come off and frustrate child,"Christmas Day I gave this to my son. I probably put the treads back in place, say, 20 times. If a younger child doesn't understand that ""Byron must go slow"", the treads will come off the wheels. Easy to ""fix Byron"", but frustrating for the child."
2,Track Problems,"My 3 year-old grandson loves Thomas and loves construction trucks so I was happy to get him Bryon to add to his collection. He thinks it is fun, but he is constantly put off because the rubber track won't stay in place. I recommend it for an older child that has the dexterity to line up the tracks when they constantly come lose."
3,KIDS LOVE IT,"WE JUST GOT THIS IN THE MAIL. THE KIDS LOVE IT; HOWEVER, IN THE LAST 15 MINUTES I'VE HAD TO PUT THE TRACK BACK ON 5-6 TIMES. I HAVE A FEELING I'LL LIVE TO REGRET THIS PURCHASE. OTHER THEN THE ISSUE OF THE TRACK CONTINUALLY COMING OFF THE KIDS SEEM TO ENJOY PLAYING WITH IT AND MY GRANDSON, WHO LOVES TRACTORS, IS DELIGHTED!"
5,Great tank!,"The tank seems just like any other tank, but it's price is what stood out for me. It's too soon to say it won't leak or have a horrible valve, but so far it does it's job. Besides, Pure Energy is a trustworthy brand."
2,Was okay.,"I used once for a long day of paintballing about a week after receiving the tank. I shot a few shots at home the week afterwards just to get the tank empty. Now it leaks, and I either have to get it fixed or buy a new one. It was really good while it still worked, but I guess I just got unlucky."
2,you run risk of getting difrent brand,"i ordered this, arrived on time, but its a spyder, i don't know how it works yet, but i thought i should say your run a risk of getting the wrong tank"
1,broke,"I bought this and it came in good condition, however, it wasnt in any kind of plastic wrapping or a case. It filled up fine and worked great, but after it ran out, I find out that the valve is broken and theres no way to repair it, so i threw it out."
4,good tank,co2 is the best in hot weather but if u dont have an expansion chamber dont use during cold weather... but other wise this is a good size tank that will fufill all ur paintball needs
2,ghettotech,so i bought this this tank and it wasnt damaged at all when i opened the package and i got it filled but when i put it in my gun it wont pressurize in the gun and im pretty sure its something wrong with the tank cause i put another tank in and it worked just fine... anybody have any suggestions?
3,works like it should,Product works as it should. Delivery could have been faster...since I paid for it to be faster. 1-3 days turned out to be 5.
3,pin valve broken,"I received this item and it looked in fine shape. However, when I filled it up for the first time all the CO2 blew out of it instantly. When I looked at it to see what was wrong I noticed that the pin valve was bent so it didn't seal shut. I'm going to have it looked at to see if it can be fixed this next week. I cannot speak for all tanks like this or about the company itself because this is the first I have used. Just saying what happened. Tank does seem nice and durable besides the bent valve."
4,"Check your threads, or check your head!","I received my 20Oz tank today, and at first I was thrilled. It was an empire bottle and not a knockoff generic brand. Being a scuba instructor, and being around tanks often, I knew to check the valve and threads. To my disappointment, I found the valve to be forced on as the corners were stripped. I also found that 2 of the 4 threads on the valve were pretty nicked up. As long as I find no leaks, and its simply cosmetic (We are playing paintball) I'll be stoked. Afterall you cant beat the price for a new tank."
4,Pretty Standard,"There isn't much to say about products like this, it comes packaged nicely and works fine. The O-Ring will crack easily if it is used in cold weather but that happens with any CO2 tank. Luckily that is a 5 cent fix and takes less than a minute to remedy. Doesn't come with a cap unfortunately so do not drop it but other than that it will fire true, enjoy!"
4,Great Tank! Great Price!,I recently purchased a paintball gun and it came with a 9oz tank. I knew right off the bat that wasn't going to cut it. I found these for under $20 with free shipping. You can't beat that. I have read all the reviews and I can't believe the people complaining that they don't come filled? Are you kidding? I'm thinking it might be a little DANGEROUS to ship a full C02 tank. My only disappointment with this order was that the tank didn't come with a cap for the pin valve. The metal is very soft and any ding can harm the pin valve and cause it to leak or not work. I purchased 3 and all of them seemed to work. I had mine refilled about a month ago before I left the facility and I popped it on my gun the other day and it worked so it isn't leaking. Same goes for the other 2. If you're looking for a C0 tank I highly recommend this one.
2,It leaked,"I liked the price, but it leaked when I had it filled.The guy filling the tank emptied it out and refilled just to make sure.The leak was near the top, at the threads."
2,customer service,"Please be careful buying from Action Village. They have a very rigid return policy. If you're going to buy an item from them, my advice is to be very certain that it is exactly what you're looking for!"
1,empty!!!,EMPTY TANK!!!!. So i thought I'd take a chance with many reviews being very satisfied with the tank they received. Unfortunately the tank I received was empty so now i get to take and spend money to have it filled. Hopefully its not gonna leak. My advice just go to Sports Authority and get it there in the first place save yourself the time by just getting one you know will work in the first place.
2,WTF!!!,This came completely empty..I try to put it in my new paintball gun & when i put it in i see it had NO Co2 i mean WTF!! i paid for Co2 not a thank all empty
1,C'mon!!,"This product was 5 stars!! except for the fact that it was empty! i read the product description and it said it was supposed to come ready to use... in other words FILLED, which mine was not. So basically it was useless because i didnt have anyplace near me to fill it up. Plus i paid for a filled one why should i go pay to get it filled"
4,Great after it starts working.,Had to pay to unclog the bottle which was highly annoying but a couple buck was worth it working then when I needed it and it is great now. 1000 balls and still probably half full!!
5,CO2 tank,"Amazingly the delivery was fast. This CO2 tank looks like it is used, but I am going to put it to the test when I go paint balling with my friends."
2,Valve bad,"I got the container on time and in good packing, but when I had it filled the Valve was bad and I had to pay to have it fixed. The bottle never would stop leaking till they fixed it."
2,treading doesn't fit Tipmann gun,"got for my son for Cmas, got it filled, disappointed when he used it for the first time as it didn't go in to the gun far enough (reading) and air leaked"
3,Nice Tank - Damaged in Shipping,"The tank I received was a PMI Pure Energy Tank. I'm sure it would have been a nice tank. Except it was dropped on the valve during shipping, which deformed the brass. Now its useless, as I am not going to risk using it after that. The packaging wasn't even that bad, but I guess still not good enough for shipping something relatively heavy in a small package. So buyer beware, there is a significant chance your tank will show up damaged."
3,Works like it should...,"This was the cheapest CO2 tank I've found. Although it wasn't packaged with nearly enough protection, the bottle didn't have any damage on it.The tank performed to all expectations, good and bad.FACT: CO2 is less consistent than compressed air.Paintball is a very fast-paced game, and you can be eliminated fairly quickly if you are not aggressive enough. Conservative players rarely make it to the end of the round. When using a marker with CO2, firing in rapid succession causes the air pressure to fluctuate significantly and eventually drop, ensuring that much of your paint will not hit its intended target. In colder climates (below 70 degrees), the tank will eventually start to ice over.If you are a serious player, save up a few more dollars and buy a tank meant to hold compressed air. You'll be glad you did."
1,Leaks,I ignored the reviews giving the item benifit of the doubt. After one use it leaked constantly. Im not going to pay to have something fixed that should have worked from the begining. Returning it and warning all who try to purchase this.
5,co2 tanks,"I got these for my son for Christmas and he says they are great. I am so glad I bought them through Amazon, I saved a bunch of money and got high quality tanks."
2,Great price but tank was expired,"The tank was the right price but the test date was expired, a test cost more than the bottle itself. So I would say good for around the house but most paintball fields will not refill this tank.Rhode Island"
1,it leaked first time,"had to return 2 tanks. 1st one would not even fill, leaked from emergency release. 2nd filled and lost Co2 will wrapped for christmas present.returned no problem, but not a good buy."
4,Best price anywhere!,Let's be honest...it's a CO2 tank for a paintball gun. What's to review? The fact of the matter is that this is a name brand tank that I was able to find on sale for thirteen bucks! These go for about twenty or thirty dollars in the store...this is a steal!
3,Enclosure at Clevely,"1795 England, enclosure was a major issue. Charles Shelmadine had resisted it all his life, but after his death, his son, Richard, has the land enclosed. Damask Greenway is a major figure in getting the process done. The division of the 'Waste' is unfair and unreasonable to most. This book follows these familes through this troubled times."
2,These dishes are really too shallow...,...for creme brulee or any other kind of custard.I use them as nut dishes when I have company. Totally useless for anything else.
1,UNREADABLE FOR NON -PORTUGESE,BOOK IS USELESS FOR ANONE SEEKING INFORMATION ABOUT A SMALL NATION THAT SANK INTO FASCISM AND SUDDENTLY BECAME-- WHAT?
2,The translation misses,"I am sure Saramago's tales are more lively than they come across in this book. Although I'm certain it was translated with care, the third-person narrative doesn't quite do it in English. I wish I had bought the Portuguese book and worked my way through, it is surely more lyrical and less clunky than this version."
4,NOT Bill Bryson,"This is Jose Saramago's spiritual journey through (primarily rural) Portugal. It's not a light-reading travel narrative. The feeling of this book is something of a cross between Henry Adams and James Michener. It's a book to read slowly and savor, in order to appreciate Saramago's tremendous metaphorical skill. He paints the picture slowly, with deliberate brush-strokes that reveal the masterpiece when viewed from a distance.Yes, his descriptions of churches, winding roads, rain and his seemingly unconscious cultural insecurity (his came from a poor family and was not a university graduate) can become tedious, but that's only if you don't grasp the larger picture: Portugal is a settled land with hundreds of years of historic layers. Saramago wants to peel those layers back for you to expose the core. Only the reader can decide if he's been successful."
1,Too much information,"We fell under Lisbons spell last April, so wanted more info on the magic. This step by step Journey might be perfect to carry along, but too much detail on streetlamps and doorways to read from afar. And very little about Lisbon. Written in 1990 by a native Portuguse the prose sounds more 19thc. Perhaps it suffers in Translation to English."
3,I would recommend killzone,"Killzone is a fun game, with good graphics. The A.I. ( Artificial Intelligence )are dumb at times and the missions are long. I would not recommend buying it if you get frustrated at dying over and over or do not have a hour to do a level , otherwise I would recommend buying it."
4,Killzone PS2,"The game itself was good. There were parts of the game that were good and parts that sucked. I bought this game because I wanted to get refreshed for Killzone 2. They game has it's glitch, and one that doesn't let you finish a level, and the very annoying frame rate problem.The story is cliche but it is an alright one, when you look at the big picture. The guy said the game was like new, but the case had it's plastic covering ripped in parts so I needed to get a new case. It kept me informed of the Killzone situation!"
5,love it.,game is a couple years old but has the best graphics for its kind for ps2 and i love it! i recommend this game!
4,BOOM,"After having embarked on a massive Exodus to the planet Helghan,the castaways of your home planet Vecta regroup and re-arm with vengeance in mind.It's up to you and some ""tough as nails"" squadmates to fend off the massive Helghast onslaught of your home planet with the help of some unique and powerful weaponry. You will fight through cities and jungles, mowing down thousands of Helghast troops along the way. From snowy mountains to gritty battlefields and every enemy and weapon,the whole game is eye candy. The action will be over the top, the journey is almost 20 hours long and every turn is raught with peril.So,the real question is can you handle this much fun? Ignore the nay-sayers and critics and experience one of the greatest battles the playstation community has ever seen. So hurry up and dive in, cause there's a world that needs saving."
3,Good game and geat condition,"Not much into Military based shooter games, but this one is ok. Just started playing, sounds like a good premise and storyline. Game arrived used, but in great condition with packaging and player instructions. All in all, any Sony Greatest Hits game is worth your library."
2,Didnt work,"was told the item was like new and worked great, but when i got it and put it in to play it, it didnt work at all! It didnt even try to work but they were nice enough to give me a refund."
2,Ok Game,"This game is ok. Though many aspects of it doesn't stand the test of time. First off the graphics are just not that great anymore, they don't stand the test of time very well. Also, aiming and targeting is really hard. The story mode is solid and ok, and the enemy AI is average. There are a few offline game modes like deathmatch and team deathmatch which are all ok. All in all it's an meh game, but considering I got this game for really really cheap, I'd suggest buying it for a nostalgia buy but that's about it. If you wanna play some kill zone pick up KZ 2 or 3, waaaaaay better graphics, solid story mode, and online play"
3,Technically Impressive PS2 Game That's Nothing Special.,"This is one of the best looking PS2 games you can find. It's got all the bullet points you'd want in a FPS, aiming, multiple weapons, secondary fire, a grenade button. What it doesn't have is any compelling story or unique innovation. It's a mediocre FPS. It might be far better than some of the crap that got shoveled onto the PS2, but there's nothing special about Killzone. If you have a sick obsession with the most calcified genre in gaming history like I do, you'll suck some fun out of Killzone, but just know what you're getting into."
3,its fun but,this game is fun to me but theres some really annoing this about the game. well when i was playing i would be at points were i need help from people but they would do nothing but get in the way and this game has some really bad glitches. like in the game i was go to a person and i sall his face missing and then it got better and the building would be gone missing. also in that game u have to hide alot of u will die because they will out run u and u would just of ur people doing nothing the only there good at is being a target.and another. also people were saying it was going to be a halo thing but when i played i thought that it was not really what people said witch made me mad cause i wanted a halo thing for ps2. this game is fun but u just have to mutch stuff that is bad about it. they should of worked with them problem before they put it out
3,halo 2/halo 1? or killzone?,"...its wierd i couldnt write a review in the normal type..it wuldnt let me...any way. This game is a good game for shooting. i have to say it has not have a great load of realism...sure the reloading is but your men dont turn on you if you shoot them and the graphics arent very good. Also i must agree with others i got pretty tired of shooting the same stupid black guys with red eyes like 3 million times.Halo 2: in this game you can hold two guns its great. Also the graphics are outstanding. Not only that its realistic, you shoot guys they shoot you back no matter if its your team or the other team. there is a whole class type of aliens which make them stronger and smarter. they are smart unlinke in kilzone the enmey stands there and is just trying to kill you. the aliens move and can come up to hit you.....etc im not gonna write no more cuz halo is such a better game.."
3,KILLZONE,Graphics are good but the control is not as good as I would like and the story line is ok but could be better I would not buy this game for more than 10 dollars and is not as good as other shooters I have played.
3,another average game,"The graphics are truly spectacular, but the thing that hurts this game is the fact that it feels like I've already played it before. In fact, I've played countless games that are basically the same thing.You have weapons. You can carry three of them at a time (think Halo). You need to use those weapons to kill the bad guys who are either hiding, or are attempting to gang up on you. You will have to fight 5 at a time quite often, and they usually head in your direction immediately. Is this a bad thing? No, it just means you will most likely die a lot.You can't jump in this game, which honestly, hurts the gameplay. Climbing ladders is also pretty difficult. The game is hard for all the wrong reasons. More importantly, the game is just your typical war-shooter which means you can skip over it and look for something more interesting."
3,Not that great,"I beta tested this game and I can tell you first hand that it is not that good. If you have played counterstrike its like that with better graphics, but the grenades dont go far, there is lag since it is online ps2, I encountered a lot of lag, and I have a cable connection with nearly 3,000 kbps. Overall you may want to rent this game first and see if its really what you want to waste money on, because you could buy other shooters that are far better I promise you that."
3,failed to be much of anything,"the game has nice graphics and cool guns but nothing else really. Boring gameplay, dumb enemies lame levels. This game tried but failed."
2,rent it before you buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game has its ups and downs. <br /><br />Here are the ups: the graphics are sweet. The maps are sweet. I played several times online and notice no lag at all. <br /><br />The downs:It doesn't have many controller configuration options.
3,Maybe I'm just slow,"Well, where do I start? I'm older guy, 31, and still play PS2. I usually move away from anything with analog control only, like this game. I really have no coordination for these games, strictly driving stuff for me. Only played it once, in easy, and against the computer on the vs. match, and its still hard. Graphics are pretty cool, as well as the weaponry. I'm sure with a bit of practice I could hold my own, but not sure how long it'lll take to get the guts to run this game again. Wish I could at least use the directional pad for movement of the person, but no luck there. Good action, lots of stuff to shoot at, just not a big fan of analog....try it though, it'll keep you hoppin'."
5,My first game,"I just got a PS2, I am far behind the times. I got this as a rental, as I was at my inlaws for Christmas, and didn't have anything but my old PS games. I was quite impressed with the story line, graphics, and game play. The weapons are right on, and I love the sound effects (especially the hollow clink of a gun fired grenade landing close by. nice warning, duck!!) I have played Halo 2 online recently, I like these weapons much better.But the coup de grace, the multiplayer levels, available offline, but set up as if they were on line. The bots are smart and tough, the levels have all the weapons (wouldn't mind being able to select only certain types), and you get endless playability from it. The best part of this is, you can make it as easy or tough as you want. So, as you get better, you can make your enemies tougher.Excellent game, I am looking to make this my first buy."
1,Not bad for alpha quality,"Hangs quite frequently, the online play (though it must be derived from an earlier engine) is full of physics and playability issues.But not bad for alpha quality, for an uninspired copy of other older games.Add to that numerous mod chips, the game is almost worthless in multi player mode. With an average mean time to failure of about an hour."
1,can i grade this one zero stars??,"After spending about 10 hours playing this monstrosity it bacame clear to me that the era of the Playstation2 is done. I packed up my PS2 and dozens of games and got what little value in trade-in that I could to switch to XBox and I couldn't be happier. Basically, this lame game was the mitigating factor to switch.All you do in killzone is run through levels that are so similar from one another it's stupid. There is no variety whatsoever in the enemies, and that really is the main problem. It's just wave after wave of the same dudes in black saying the same phrases over and over in their deep voices.Oh yeah, it takes at least 5 to 6 head shots to down an average Helghast-it's so fake. The story is lame, the graphics are fair but just as dull as everything else on the game. I guarantee you that not once will you find yourself thinking ""that was a cool effect"", or ""how'd they do that?"". This game is the perfect cure for insomnia, however. Trust me and [...]. Horrible."
4,Fun First Person Shooter,"This game is a lot of fun. You do need to get used to the slow pace, but once you do, it's a lot of fun. I haven't beaten it yet, but I think I am close to the end. The story is not bad, though the gameplay for me is a lot more interesting than the story."
5,Killzone Rocks,killzone is the best game i have ever played.The graphics are amazing.The computer ai is great.The levels are great because with different people there are different objectives.You should really get this game
4,Mutant Nazis,"This game is great, but then again, I don't play over the internet. Two player mode sucks, but as far as single player campaigns go, I think this is one of the best ps2 shooter games. The bad guys definately make the game, and the story isn't completely horrible. I spent $15 for it, and it was worth every penny."
4,I LOVED this game!!,"First of all, I am not one of those people that play war games or shooting type games-- but I think that this game may have just converted me. This is one of the best games in this genre that I've played and is well worth the money. I thought that the story line (which followed a group of soliers) was interesting and the levels were challenging. It was tough to get coordinated at first with the controls, but once you get it, you got it, and the game moves uphill from there. My favorite part of the game, though, was the multiplayer mode. Forget the storyline and get some of your buddies to play that! I can play that for hours ( but the dual screen can get confusing). I highly recommend this game."
4,"Pretty, but significant playability issues","Killzone is nicely detailed, the graphics are very good and it's got a sophisticated European feel to it, but several issues significantly reduce its playability.1. Sluggish controls. It's like you're trying to move in chest-deep water. Everything moves slowly.2. Enemies are stupid, yet difficult to kill.3. Members of your squad just get in the way -- excess baggage. Get out of my way! I'm trying to play a video game, here!I wanted to play a good game, but this hasn't turned out to be even a halfway decent game. I can't recommend it."
4,"good game, not very hard though","I rented this game some time ago because of all the hype. I thought the action and the graphics where good(I'm not one of these cry babies that is never satisfied with graphics being not good enough). However, I made it through the game somewhat quickly. Thegame could have been a little more challenging. Nevertheless, it was entertaining for the least. Kind of like futuristic nazis. Maybe a sequel would be better."
4,Voive In The Game Play.,"Hi there, i recently bought this game and i must say it like it alot,BUT i have a problem with this game during play, that voice that is always shouting when an enemy or someone gets hit, is sooooooooo darn annoying, could you guys please replace that for with something more calm, it is too rough a voice and it distracts you during game play,it sounds like something for the 80's horror movies.thanks Vidsta."
4,"So close to perfection, if only...","So close to perfection, if only it wasn't for those graphical glitches, and the rare but present frame rate problem, the game could've been EXCELLENT but it turn out GREAT, all flaws taken into consideration, I think is a must have for FPS lovers."
5,Worth the $20 bucks,"This game is a lot of fun. Sure, the story could have been better, big deal! Games shouldn't be defined by their plots. That's what movies are for. I love this game. When I first bought it, I couldn't put it down. This game makes me want to buy a PS3 just so i can get the sequel. If you enjoy First Person Shooters, then this is for you."
1,Overhyped stink bomb,Careful when you play this game it made my hand smell for a week. I tried to be open minded but I could not help but feel a bit taken by all the hype and theme. It is a complete let down when you play this game. I played it for about 3 hours put it down and have not picked it up since. Too many good games out to waste your time with this one. Anyone still saying this is a Halo killer probably works for Guerilla games or Sony.
1,This game stinks,"It is so sorry.The graphics are horrible.This isnt even 10,000 miles away from being a ""halo killer.""If you want a real fps get halo 2.It has awsume graphics and smooth gameplay.Or doom 3 it looks good.Anything but ps2 games!!!!!!!!!"
1,How can they release this game,"I was totally shocked that Sony released this game to the public.It is buggy, AI is ridiculous. This game took 4 years apparently. Although it looks they spent 6months on this game.The graphics remind me of dreamcast graphics. The gameplay is well below par.I expected a Halo killer, and I got a bat and ball game instead.I would possibly rent this before wasting money on such rubbish.A total let down for PS2 fans. I will now place my hopes on GT"
1,This Game Sucks,"After playing for 12 hrs on this game. I can honestly say this game SUCKS BIG TIME!The AI is the worse I have ever seen in a game. How can 4 yrs of development lead to abismal AI. The graphics are fair, but still remind me of graphics for a game that was out 4 yrs back.There is no real story, and it is just to repetitive.I wanted to like this game, but I hated it.I am now following the hype and buying a Xbox and HALO2.The PS2 has now let me down, high expectations and they can't deliver."
1,stop and think first.....then forget this thing,"I purchased this product without really thinking and you can learn from my waste of money. If you are a smoker and intend to light up and set your cigarette, cigar, etc. in the ashtray and let it burn....you might need this. If it is in your fingers, you will have to hold it under the umbrella to in order for the thing to work! It makes no sound..does it really do anything? The smoke wafts around the top and nothing exits the small openings on top. The first time I cleaned it, (very carefully with a very mild soap in water and let it dry overnight unplugged) and then plugged it in and turned it on, the light (this is the indicator that it is operating) came on, went out, and it is now a reminder to me to STOP AND THINK BEFORE I SPEND MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON GARBAGE LIKE THIS!!!!"
2,Editing is your friend.,"Dear author of ""Stars Over Stars"",Have you considered having your work edited? I have been reading it in two-chapter increments, and I was still very much annoyed by the endless repeated of the folowing points:1. Fleck smell.2. Laka are pieceful.3. Heyoka has ""Other"" inside of him, that is not human.4. Heyoka feels guilty for Mitsu.5. Heyoka feels guilty for not interfacing furballs into the military better.6. Mitsu is crazy.7. Mitsu has been a prisoner of Fleck and cannot take it again.8. Male laka are naive.9. Heyoka can't blueshift.10. The firballs do not deal with human discipline.11. The firballs challenge/ do not challenge/ think about challenging.Seriously, it was very annoying.No love,Me."
5,A delicious read!,"A delicious read! Loved it! Loved it! Great action, great characters immerse you in Wentworth's fascinating universe!"
2,Dissertations Please!,"A typical dissertation makeover, this book analyzes some of Melville's works through the extraordinarily narrow lens of mourning rituals. Whether this actually illuminates anything central to any of his works is questionable, but there is some interesting information about mourning in nineteenth century American culture. That's not, however, why anyone would read this book."
4,A Study in the Culture of Poverty,"A popular field of study in the l960s was the 'culture of poverty.' Anthropology had the advantage of being familiar with such culture in most parts of the world. Lewis first wrote about it in Mexico.Five FamiliesWhen he turned his attention to Puerto Rico, he had a significant reputation behind him, and La Vida attracted much critical attention. It did not meet the high standard he set in Five Families, but the work is important because of Puerto Rico's centrality in New York as well as it being a part of the United States.Lewis' obvious empathy for his subjects while maintaining objectivity as well as his clear writing make the book well worth reading.ernestschusky.com"
2,50% off,"Supposed to be two novels. But only the first ""Texas Rifles"" was there. I love Kelton's work. Great story just didn't get the 2nd book"
3,texas rifles review by zac,"i htought this book was pretty good. Though, i thought it could have been alot better. The thing i didnt like about it was that is was to long of a book about nouthing."
1,what you don't need to believe to be a nice spiritual person,"This book all but goes through the apostles creed, explaining how not a line of it is really necessary. While it is true that he does touch on subjects that aren't necessary, he eviscerates all actual theology in the process. As near as I can tell from his writings, his feeling is that as long as you have warm and fuzzy feelings towards a god-like idea then the term Christian can be stretched to include you. There has to be some line at which you say ""if you are not a follower of Christ, then you are not a Christian"". It is important to note here that this means the actual Christ, that you try to get to know, not the Christ that you think you might like to know, or the Christ that you would have been in his place, or the Christ that your enlightened person feels would be preferable."
2,"english speaker wanting to SPEAK farsi, ok, otherwise don't bother","This book, unlike its advertisement include no written farsi. you cannot use it to look up written farsi words, because it only includes transliterations. it would most probably be helpful for an English speaker to use to help them speak some farsi to an extent, but not helpful at all for much of anything else. disappointing because i thought we'd finally found a simple farsi-english, english-farsi book. bought for a farsi speaker, for whom it is useless."
5,Great Album,"Great album. I was unsure about getting this album at first because I only knew the one song ""Can't Sleep,"" but I'm glad I got it. It's an easy album to listen to."
4,Great stuff,"A solid set of great tracks. You've probably heard some of it on A State Of Trance if you pay attention. Great vocals, great beats, you'll listen to this over and over and never get tired of it. I've probably already got 20 plays of Alone Tonight in the couple weeks I've had it. Truly fantastic stuff. All the tracks are mixed together nicely, the CD flows smoothly. There's a little bit of upbeat, and some slower songs; if you like trance, you'll love this."
5,One of my fav cds......,"This cd is a def fav of mine, and everyone who hears it asks who it is. All the songs blend seamlessly into each other and they are all wonderful. No skipping around on this cd to find good tracks like some mix cd's..... my fav song is ""can't sleep"".......it's beautiful.......i listen to that song over and over......lol"
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"Great mixing, stunning vocals and a ton of great songs.Favorite song: ""Good For Me"".I'm sure lots of people will go for the more upbeat tracks. But when you listen to the harmonies,the spaciousness, it's hard not to love that track. There's something here for everyone.If you like ambient and trance, you will find a lot to love.Highly Recommended.-EveningOcean CD ""The Attraction"" Evening Ocean comTHE ATTRACTION"
2,Soft,I have heard these guys play before live there are off the chain . It was a little to soft for me But ok . I think they put way to many vocal songs on the cd but over all they did a good job . It was ok but not the best cd over all put in 2006 far from it .
5,loved it,"My four year old son loves this book. Its a chapter book, so a little old for him, but its his first Batman book and he loves it. My 6 year old daughter enjoys it, too, because Catwoman is in it. So I can read it to both of them!"
5,Critical proverbs to live by translated + explained,"This is the book I have been looking for my entire life. The proverbs listed here are unbelievably wise. Proverbs are the KEY to Yoruba religion and culture, and this book translates and explains them well. The words here are profound. If you think that Yoruba ritual is powerful then you will be awed by these proverbs; they are even deeper than than the spirituality!"
5,One of the Finest Films Ever Produced,"I saw Career Girls when it was released several years ago, and I am buying the video because the film has been re-playing in my brain ever since. Career Girls, like Secrets and Lies, is slice-of-life filmmaking at its very best. There is not one wasted frame in the film, and for every moment that is grim, there are two that amuse, stimulate and uplift. This film should be on the top-ten list of every intelligent film buff, or for that matter of any one who enjoys timeless works of art."
5,Two Wonderful Recordings!,"The Parrott led Israel in Egypt is the best recording of that work I've ever heard; see my review of it sold as a separate CD. The Messiah included in this set is also a great recording but just a tad below that of some others I own. But, if this recording was the only one you owned, you'd not fear you're not hearing a great rendition and any Messiah fans you played it for wouldn't criticize it as a second-rate or uninspired recording. Both recordings are 5 star ones. But, if you love these works, you'll probably end up with several Messiahs and a couple of Israel in Egypts. There is no one best way to conduct, orchestrate, etc. these magnificent works Mr. Handel has given to us. Enjoy!"
2,Disappointing,"This Aubrey product was a disappointment. Up to now all Aubrey products I've tried have been very good, but the scent of this aftershave could hardly be described as 'spicy' - more like rubbing alcohol. Not a pleasant scent."
2,Disapointed in the book,"I went by the reviews and thought I couldn't beat the price, but received the cookbook today and I was very disapointed. First of all, I like pictures of the cookies when I'm trying a new recipe, and most of the recipes have no pictures. Also, I love chocolate chip cookies, but do we really need 5 different recipes?? I did enjoy the little info given for some types of cookies, such as the biscotti. But all in all, would not recommend this book, too few recipes, no pictures, so glad I only paid 4 bucks for it. I can't really understand someone stating it's the best cookie cookbook they've even seen.....seriously????"
5,Awesome Book!,This book is awesome. I've made the best chocolate chip cookies EVER using this book. The recipes are so easy and so good and everything makes since. I now know why my cookies used to flatten out.
3,Sinatra,I didn't like the selection of movies for the Sinatra DVD. I had forgotten that Pal Joey was my all time favorite and of course wasn't on this collection.
4,Exactly what I wanted,"First off shipping was fantastic. Packaged securely and arrived in 2-3 days.It holds the tlc cone, and has a nice deep groove to catch the dust.It does come unassembled. It requires 2 screws to be inserted into pre-drille holes from the back and into pilot holes in the horizontal piece that the cone sits on. Plus you have to screw the center pin in as well. Then you even have to mount it to your own wall.I read a few bashing this and had to laugh. Sorry for my sense of humor. If I could nitpick anything there are no instructions for assembly and different types of screws are included so it may be difficult to figure out which screws are for mounting and which were for assembly. However if you have ever managed to successfully hang a picture on the wall you should be able to figure this out.Great Seller. Grear Shipping. Product as advertised. Would buy again."
1,Rather have my eyes poked out!,"Man o man I got this game last week. Got all the controls and settings all how I wanted them and saved it, I said to my self yea I am going to have a good time and play some ATV racing. What the heck after 10 minutes BORING BORING, I have had much more fun playing pong than this junk. They should be ashamed of this game might end up selling this video game to a game store or yard sale, Cause its going to collect dust sitting on my shelf cause I will never play it again!"
4,Producto recomendado,Excelente producto y embalaje. El tiempo en llegar a Venezuela y entrega depende de la Aduana Venezolana. El tiempo de entrega en Miami se cumple segun lo indican al hacer la compra.
4,Good game,Great game for my 6 yearold grandson he loves it. He likes the option of golf carts or even monster trucks. he plays it for hours
1,Offroaders Beware!!!,"What a let down. The reason we are seeing such a dramatic decrease in quality with the 3rd installment is that Rainbow Studios (creators of Motocross Madness 1 & 2, ATV Off Road Fury 1 & 2, and MX Unleashed) had nothing to do with ATV 3. Sony gave the job to Climax who I must say don't know what they are doing. The graphics, driving mechanics, music, race tracks, and options are all inferior. You can't even load two profiles at once to race your friends. Save your money (like I should have done) for MX vs. ATV Unleashed by Rainbow Studios which comes out in February. Happy roosting."
3,atv fury,"Ordered from Amazon, never received my order. Had to buy it at the local EB Games store. Game is OK, but will never order through Amazon again!"
3,It's ok,It wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for one that I had played which you could crash together and such and this doesn't. You can do a lot of different tricks and such but not what I am looking for.
2,Son bought this,Son bought this and he didn't quite care for it. It came in a very fast manner. Sooner then they guesstamated.
2,A Good First Try at Writing,"Obviously this author's first book, it was frought with typos and other literary faux pas. That being said, the book is entertaining. The author has a wonderful vocabulary and is very expressive, I enjoyed his writing style. However, the character development was slow and choppy. I think the author has alot of potential which will reveal itself better when he writes about more diverse topics instead of drug binges from beginning to end."
4,coffee,When I saw this coffee I was very excited. Some of the best coffee I'd ever had came from Costa Rica.I was very pleased.
2,Shipping charge,"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Britt coffees and Costa Rican coffees. I don't have an issue with the product or the price for the product. My beef is with the outrageous shipping charge for a 12 oz. sealed bag of coffee. That was about $10. The coffee cost $9.50. The shipping box was big enough to hold ten bags of coffee. Why not just a sturdy envelope? I will definitely find Costa Rican coffee in my local area and buy from a brick & stick store. Usually I try to offset the state sales tax (8.25% in the DFW area)with the shipping and handling charge. There seems to be a trend of increasing shipping and handling costs. Local sales tax on this purchase would have been in the range of $0.80. Soon we will all be paying sales tax AND shipping charges through on internet sales unless something keeps us from paying ANOTHER tax which will surely affect the internet market. Anyway, just my 2 cents worth. No more Britt through Amazon for me."
4,An Interesting Read,"After reading Valiant Bride, I had to purchase the entire series. And, overalll, many of the books have their flaws. Duncan Montrose is a bigot to be sure, and Noramary, his innocent, virtuous wife, loves him in spite of his ignorance. (Foolish man, shoudln't he know if his own wife has been with another man?) This was the main flaw in the otherwise brilliant story. Still, in spite of it, Peart is a magnificent writer."
3,made no sense,only a mediocre book. she has a bland style and the general concept made no sense. her writing is also non descriptive. her style could use a little work.
1,Not as low profile as expected,"I bought this helmet expecring to be low peofile after reading people rants n raves about how low it sits on your head so i ordered it, as i needed a dot helmet due to a recent ticket, when it arrived and placed it on it still gave me to dreeeded mushroom head!!! It sits lower now all it took was some time n shaving of the interior foam [haha] i would not recommend this to anybody whose looking for a low peofile dot helmet."
3,Leaves marks on clothes,This deo was just ok. It did work as far as my husband not smelling but he won't be able to wear it in the summer because he doesn't always wear an undershirt. There are defined marks on his undershirts that show through to the outside and will not come off. Guess we will go back to the other stuff!!
5,Good deal,"Workks well smells good , helps to decrease sweating. Very good value in the multipack much cheaper than bus or target."
1,Not invisible,"Description states that this is an invisible solid but is is not. It is a white, powder-based deodorant and it is most certainly visible upon first application. I made a poor choice to purchase this before reading all of the reviews. I read the top rated review which stated ""no white residue"" and thought I was in the clear (no pun intended).I used the deodorant once and it began clumping and flaking just as any common white stick will. I will not risk ruining countless shirts as similar deodorants have in the past. Buyer be warned. If you want an invisible stick, this is not it."
5,The best deodorant on the market,I've used Degree deodorant for a long time and like the Clean scent. I work in manufacturing and it works all night long. I'm not a fan of the big scents of Old Spice and Speed Stick. I think Degree is the best anti-perspirant/deodorant on the market and it's not too expensive.
3,"works okay, but I wont buy degree anymore","As a deodorant, it does do its job -- no complaints, and the scene it not overbearing. My biggest complaint is that shortly after you put it on, its starts flaking everywhere. Case in point, I went to the doctor, and needed to take my shirt off. Once my shirt and undershirt came off, I have deodorant flakes flying all over the place from my pits. I had only put this on about 30 minutes prior, and there is goes flaking everywhere. It doesnt matter how much you put on, it just ends of flaking, and its nasty. My other complaint is that some of the scents are way too powerful like clean slate, and its smell like you dumped a bottle of cologne on even if you only put a little. I really recommend trying something else because I am."
1,broke very quickly,"After spending the money to have an electrician wire this into the dining room, in less than a year (and we hardly ever use the room) the fixture has broken where the metal base of the sconce meets the curly support piece. There are wires exposed due to this defect, so not only am I going to have to buy another fixture, I am going to have to pay an electrician again. Very unhappy - cheaply made product. Our last fixture, which was just from some hardware store, lasted over 25 years."
3,Matthew Kelly-Better with Age,"I enjoyed this book and have added it to my Matthew Kelly library. This is one of his earlier works and he has definately improved with age. Matthew Kelly's ""The Rhythm of Life"" and ""The Dream Manager"" are exceptional books!!! Both are a definate ""must read""."
3,"Not Ulysses, but somewhat enjoyable","I fount this anthology to be average. I was particularly taken with the story ""Becky Lives"", which makes this worth the price of admission. Some of the other stories are interesting, some aren't. Like I said, rather average."
4,Legacy,"Legacy is Madball's, what 10th album? I really don't know but my eyes were just opened to this band recently, but from what i hear and see Madball has been around for a long time. Well after listening through Legacy I can honestly say it wasn't really anything original, but it wasn't unoriginal. Overall Legacy is a good album, I would recomend that you really get a good listening to them before you invest money into one of their albums.xx"
1,"Call me ""disappointed"".","I was really looking forward to this deck. I'd heard positive things about it. Then I got mine. Personally, the art didn't really appeal on closer examination. It seemed childish and overly crowded and fussy, like grade 4 students' posters. But that is just a personal thing. I'm sure many might find it...nice. Just not me.What really bugged me was that the deck that arrived had several duplicate cards and was missing some cards entirely, even though still sealed. This, and the somewhat flimsy card stock told me that whatever job the deck's creator had done, no care had been taken by the publisher. Especially since the publisher never bothered to reply to my polite enquiries regarding getting individual replacement cards. Thankfully, the seller agreed to take a useless deck back, much to my relief. Sadly, I can't recommend this deck at all."
1,Love Ernie....but beware!,"Five stars for the material, but this is just a repackaging of one of the DVDs from the Ernie Kovacs Collection. If you love early T.V., and appreciate comic genius, buy the box set. The seeds for Laugh-In, David Letterman, and free-wheeling surreal comedic video were sewn by Ernie.I also recommend the biography by Diana Rico, Kovacsland. Read it during the same time period you watch the DVDs, and get a deep, real understanding of the revolutionary and visionary Ernie Kovacs."
4,Ernie Kovacs,This gift is for my husband who adored Ernie Kovacs and when he sees this DVD I hope he responds to it as he did when he used to watch him.
2,Very disappointed.,"Not happy with this DVD at all. It shows very little of Finland. Not interested in the artwork. Was hoping to see the countryside of Finland, would not recommend this to anyone."
4,FRESHMAN PSYCH -- Cool Cultish Indie,"Freshman Psych is a cool cult-like indie. I heard this was a franchise. Sophomore Psych, Junior Psych, then Senior Psych to follow. Wonder if that's true. Anyway wish they would remake it with a bigger budget -- great story."
1,Another Savage,"First of all this is fiction however Chief Satanta was a real Kiowa Chief. The captive in this book, Adrianne Chastain, never existed. There is absolutely no historical evidence that Satanta took a white captive. It is an insult to the descendants of Satanta.This is your basic unresearched western about a smart beautiful white woman stolen by savages, raped, watched as her lover slit her son's throat but yet she falls head over heels in love with him. The plot is absolutely ridiculous. No sensible woman could stand by and watch her captor murder her child then fall in love with him.The Kiowa culture and tradition is tragically inaccurate in this book. I also found the author portrayed Satanta as a bloodthirsty heartless monster and we Native Americans are sick of our ancestors being tarnished!"
4,good but bad price,"this is a good tank but for the price, just go to walmart and buy a 20 oz. tank. you would get about 900 shots from this tank before refilling it. u get about 75 shots per ounce(i think)."
3,"Light yet durable, but probably cheaper at your local shop","I like the size of this tank. I prefer having two 12 oz tanks over the 20+ oz tanks. This one is fairly light but feels durable and about the same as the other sized models.I only gave this three stars because I found it cheaper at my local paintball retailer for $19.99, and they filled it for me free of charge."
4,awesome price,"Highly recommended and I have never had to hang wallpaper before and it was easy. I would have rated this a five but the paper sticker stuck to the wallpaper and caused some tears so order more than you need by at least 6"" per roll. This was not a problem for me but the directions are the sticker and if you tear it and can't read then good luck. So, great looking product at a steal of a price just be careful opening the product."
5,great purchase,"this was an awesome price for this wallborder, the cheapest i found on the internet. Product came very quickly. The only negative thing i could think of is that the baseball field in the background isn't the braves field. that wasn't a problem for me, but might be for someone. i was very pleased with this purchase"
3,Grimms,A lot of the storeies in here do not make any sense. I forced myself to finish the book. it's ok
1,Grammar,The book could be even more interesting if efforts are made to modernise the grammar to the modern english spoken throughout the world.I wouldnt have bought this book if I knew it was written in the archaic version of the english language.
4,Cats LOVE this!!,"This is the good stuff my cats come running for!This is a jar of dried fish ""shavings."" They're paper thin, and cats ADORE them. I have to hide the jar, because if I don't, I find the jar in the morning with little kitty tooth marks all over it, from them trying to get it open. LOL.This stuff is such a big hit at my house, that I have taught my cats tricks- like to ""Sit"" on command, in exchange for this treat- that's how much they love it.Best of all, I have a cat whose tummy gets upset easily, and she never gets sick after eating this like she did with other kinds of treats. This is 100% pure dried fish- NO fillers, which is great.I deducted one star because these shavings tend to turn to powder in the bottom of the jar, which makes the cats sneeze so I usually have to throw a tiny bit of it away- but it is a very small portion compared to the size of the container.Overall, this is a great product, healthy and makes kitties VERY happy. I buy it regularly."
2,Mature?,"Neuropa sinks in this album. Gone are the complicated patches and swirling programs. What left is barely crafted darkwave thoughts, and it doesn't sound good. If darkwave is your stick, stick to Seabound or other bands that are more developed in the sound. Disappointing!"
3,An academic compilation,"This is a collection of academic papers on various stages of Canadian naval history. While each paper examines a particular era of Canadian naval history, and a specific issue in that era (for example, the creation of the Royal Canadian Navy under Borden), this is not a book for someone looking for a good overview of the history of Canada's maritime forces."
4,Review from a photographer,"I bought this book last week from a mail order. However, I was kind of disappointed about this book as a young portrait photographer. 1) This book talks nothing about photography lighting. (Because of the name called ""Light and Illusion"") It only talks about Ray Jones' photography life. 2) The quality of the photos in this book is not very good (Except few of them have great quality.) I also read ""Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits"" which has very good quality of pictures. (I am not too sure that is because George Hurrell always used 8x10, 4x5 camera so his picture quliy in that book is consistency). Anyway, this is my opining."
5,As I Am,"Suzy K's voice and choice of songs is a refreshing change from all the dance music that sounds contrived and heartless. One song to the next has great melodies and lyrics, a rare combination these days. It's a keeper for my car."
1,Awful!!,"Please save your money and find something else- poor use of language, poor explanations. Don't waste your $$, even if it is on your syllabus. I ended up buying a different one- even though this was referenced in my class. Avoid like the plague!!!"
1,Do your students a favor...,"A good text should allow the student to learn without intense reinstruction from the professor. This book fails miserably at achieving such a result. So do your students a favor, choose another text unless you are interested in delivering vigorous (re)explanations of concepts supposedly laid out within this piece of trash."
1,The worst book of Coulter's viking trilogy!!!!!!!,"Catherine Coulter's viking stories started out fun and interesting, but its like she just had to pick some character to portray so she just decided to use Cleve. He was not (in this book)like the nice sweet person portrayed in Lord of raven's peak. This story is from Cleve and his future wife chessa's perspectives. But what is it with Coulter and giving these slaves royal or special lineage. In raven's peak Laren had royal lineage and was betrayed by her sisters. Now in this story cleve also has interesting heratige. She was running on empty when this was written. I liked the first 2, but it should have been just the 2. This book was not neccesery, and is not fun to read like the previous novels."
3,very fragmanted with many typos and contradictions,"I enjoyed having all the characters from the first two books included in this one, however, there seemed to be three separate stories with many slow areas. Typos were numerous as well as contradictions, such as; pg. 153 ""It was so unexpected, the concubine screamed"" - pg. 162 ""Weren't the two young girls last night quite lovely? They're mute, born that way . . ."" Lastly, this novel was very believable until Lord Varrick with his magic stick entered. At that point it was as if Ms. Coulter ran out of things to write about and didn't know how to get out of the story. I have read and enjoyed many Catherine Coulter novels prior to this and will continue to do so."
1,What on Earth?,"I am still trying to figure out this book. I actually wondered if the writer was a bit senile. Chessa, the heroine, reacts oddly to many situations, more like a confused child. The overall book gave me a confused, eerie feeling, and the plot could barely hold water. I can't compare this to her other books, since this one put me off the author permanently, but this book was so terrible I had to review it and find out if anyone else was thinking, ""What?"""
3,Lord of Falcon Ridge,"I finished the tri even though the 1st book was terrible and the 2nd was very good and now the third seemed to be thrown in to complete the set. It was an ok read, but I came away not really caring about how it ended. The characters and the setting never really worked well together and the the back and forth story between certain characters became a bore. Glad I am done with the set. I do not think Ms. Coulters books are ones that I will go in search for in the future."
4,Surprise by bad rating,There are 4 books to the viking series. And I purposely saved this to read last because I thought I would like this one the LEAST. Was I ever wrong!!! It turns out to be the second best right behind Season of the Sun.I laugh like crazy during the parts when Chessa wanted Cleve to look good in front of the guys so she made up that Cleve made love to her 5 times during the night and that his size was beyond anything she's seen. This become the envy of the boys because they didn't think it was possible.I thought this story was cute. The heroine really liked Cleve and admired his ability and wanted him regardless of what other said. There were no abuse here between the herione and hero which is refreshing.The one thing I didn't like about the story is that they never explained how Chessa had certain power and ability and were able to see things that Cleve's father were able to see.
2,Yuck - Worst of the Trilogy!,"This is definitely the worst of the Viking Trilogy! Coulter is one of the more prolific writers and also one of the most inconsistent. The best of the series was the first (Hawkfell), followed by the second (Raven's Peak). Ms Coulter should have stopped there.While Chessa was a spunky, likeable heroine, I have no clue what made her so mad so quickly about Cleve. I found him dull, dull, dull! His daughter was quite cute, but for the life of me, I couldn't see what Chessa saw in him.And the whole Loch Ness monster thing and the magic stick Cleve's father had - well it was just plain silly.I'm the sort who will read and re-read over and over books that I like. This will not be one of them."
1,Snorkeling Guide? This has nothing to do with Snorkeling,"I bought this book and the Diving and Snorkeling Guide to the Cayman Islands sight unseen. Ususaly Lonely Planet has great books but not this time. This is a dive guide, not a snorkeling guide. Putting Snorkeling into the title is a blatent attempt to sell more books. There is almost no info about where to snorkel in Monterey or Northern California. Instead, the info is just about diving. Info about diving a site that is in 75 feet (etc..) of water has nothing to do with being able to snorkel it."
4,Nice Little Collection...,Enjoyable...weird...shows their potential for the future...but after listening to their newer albums first...not tons in itself...from a fans perspective...great...from a casual listener...not much there...I do recommended it due to some catchy tracks...but unless your a fan of the group avoid it...
2,Not worth the money,We have been disappointed that these clips don't stay put & it is very hard to get the curtain to go inside the small slot
5,Solved my problem!,"Had a persistent leak that showed up in the basement when all the time it was water escaping the shower curtain. Wow, now with this product problem is solved!"
5,works as advertised,Easy t0 install and performs well. I purchased more for use in another bathroom and may get some more as spares
4,gave them two chances,"first batch I bought failed to stick. fell off in a week. Worked with the company and advised of their failure. they sent me a batch with new glue. worked much better...still stick. However, my wife and I have decided to buy a shower door as they still don't prevent the splashing we bought them to prevent."
2,Double-stick tape not sticky,The double-stick tape on these clips didn't last very longl. Then you have to scrape it off the tiles with a razer blade. I've yet to find shower clips that work well!
1,Not Your Solution,The idea of the clips is to keep your water in the tub and your shower curtain closed. The clips require extraordianary small motor skills to open and close. To tuck the shower curtain into the clips is no easy task. Maybe you would have more success with hitting a Tim Wakefield knukle ball.
5,Musical catharsis!,"This album can be considered Leon Ware at his best; sensual, sexy, heartfelt. Give me this one anytime over Gaye's ""I Want You"". Marvin's album seems disconnected, absent of an overall plan, maybe because of its rushed release and 'borrowed' tracks. ""Musical massage"" was released slightly before, and it shows true substance, beautiful vocals (including two duets with Minnie Ripperton) shown in songs such as 'Holiday', or 'Musical Massage'. It also includes some unreleased tracks such as the unfinished and gorgeous 'Best of Two Worlds'. Its a shame that a record of this quality has to re-released by an independent British label, and bought as an import; Ware deserves as much recognition as Gaye in his own country. He's just as brilliant!"
4,Interesting,"In my desperate attempt to search for interesting early 19th century operas (Spohr's 'Jessonda' is still winning), Marschner's score is another frustrating example of an interesting exercise that does not make the grade of good operas that are unjustly neglected. The piece is mercifully presented with cuts as one of Marschner's greatest sins is his tendency to overwrite and repeat text unneccessarily (""Der Vampyr"" particularly suffers from this). The libretto is a particularly stupid affair in the German supernatural mode and makes ""Der Freischütz"" seem a model of intelligence. A good performance nevertheless with Hermann Prey in fine form. Sound is only adequate."
1,BORING,IF you like to listen to the same song over and over again this is the perfect CD for you. The two songs are pretty much the same and dull
1,Plumbum in your ears,"A pure pop song. I wouldn't say that I like it for it's not a good thing to compilate musicians in ""Popstar"" competitions. It's a little bit false. There are so many groups who make their own music for long years but have never found any fame. And those girls who have no common interests except for the big bucks and a peace of the cake of fame are now top in Germany. Yes, I know that most music is made by special people who don't look good enough and (probably) don't have a good voice but the ""Popstar"" project is far too comercial. It's like fast food- absolutely without any privacy in it. And the song ""Daylight in your eyes"" - it's rather primitive and doesn't make any sense. I didn't like this song for I think that art must be real and not made by a group of producers."
4,Great read!,"I just finished reading Beyond This Place and can highly recommend it. I have read several of Cronin's other books and knew of the quality of his writing. I would rank this book, although relatively unheralded, right up there with the best of Cronin's writing. It is essentially a mystery novel, with many plot twists, and it is hard to put down. It also contains some great descriptions of city life in England during the 1930's and some very interesting and well drawn characters. It also reminds us of some important lessons along the way, including love, fortitude, forgiveness, the importance of freedom of speech and the rights to all of a fair trial. This would make a great BBC mystery production. If you want a great read, try Beyond This Place."
5,Oscillococcinum,I like the size of the packaging. I have used this product for years and recommend it all the time.
5,economically,"I know this item very long time, and I know it works. I was happy when I found this package, because it is really economically. So now I'm sure it is enough and profitable for my family."
1,Expensive Pseudoscience,"I tried this many years ago for a cold I had. Did NOTHING. Later I found out it did nothing because it has no active ingredients and based on nonsense known as ""homeopathy "" The idea more you dilute something the STRONGER it becomes. So of course of if you dilute it down to one part in 10 to the 400th power it must be strong stuff, NOT! It's a sugar pill with no active ingredients and no effect on colds or flu."
5,No flu this year!!,"My family and I work with the public everyday and we have been using oscillococcinum since the flu outbreak of 2012/2013. With all the hacking, sniffling, and body aches coming through our door, we are convinced that our healthy habits and this product aided us in keeping our immune system working to fight-off all the germs coming our way! I will purchase again and recommend others do as well."
5,Great Product,"This is a terrific staple for cold and flu season. Was extremely happy with price. Shipping a little slow, but it was free, so I won't complain! Glad to have found seller."
5,A MUST READ!!!!,"I HIGHLY recommend this book without any reservations. EVERYONE..married, divorced, or single should have a copy. The principals shared in this book will literally save a relationships/marriage...A MUST READ!!!!!"
5,One Flesh - Great Book,"This is an awesome book for those want to get married, currently engaged to be married or already married. Awesome insight from the Word of God about what marriage truly is and is supposed to be. Bob Yandian not only relates his personal marriage struggles but gives us insight how he and his wife overcame those struggles. I highly recommend this book.One Flesh: God's Gift of Passion- Love, Sex & Romance in Marriage"
5,Salvame la Vida by Lucybell,Es una buena LP con canciones pripias de la banda y igualmente tambien interpretan canciones de otras artistas del pasado como Soda Stereo y Los Prisioneros.
5,History repeats itself!,"Mrs. Tuchman's books are vivid, lucid, and make you experience the events. A must for anyone truly interested in history! It is a shame the world does not have someone of her caliber to write today's history. Maybe I just haven't read their's yet.She makes a clear case of cause and effect in our modern world of past mistakes and the ones we are about to make again. Our so called scholars and regional experts from the State Dept. could learn alot from her books!"
5,Explains the Importance of the Zimmermann Telegram,"From the techniques involved in decoding and deciphering German diplomatic messages (in layman's terms) to the sacrifices and lives spent acquiring the knowledge of Room 40 (i.e. code books) to the tenacious efforts of Germany to spark U.S involvement in Mexico as well as against the Japanese(!), Tuchman provides a thorough account on the Zimmermann Telegram and its crucial role in pulling a reluctant American nation into the First World War. As a History grad student, I never knew about Germany's aims regarding Japan (""the Yellow Peril"") during this period until I read this book. In addition, Tuchman's excellent and often witty writing style makes Zimmermann Telegram (and her many other works) gripping and entertaining, as well as informative."
4,"""On the first of February, we intend to begin unrestricted submarine warfare.""","What I like best about Barbara Tuchman as a history writer is the sense of humor and amazement that you can hear in her writing as she talks about the foibles of history and its dramatis personae. I do not like The Zimmerman Telegram as much as I like its big brother,The Guns of August. It is a dense treatment of a pivotal incident relating to the Great War, rather than a larger treatment of the conflict itself. This doesn't make it bad, but I was glad that I read The Zimmermann Telegram after having read Guns of August.The Zimmerman telegram was one of the instruments that contributed to bringing the US into the Great War. Tuchman focuses on the events that led up to the fateful telegram and touches on relevant issues such as Mexican politics, code-breaking, and US neutrality.Recommended."
5,Goes & goes,"This battery shoots and shoots and shoots! I used it for ten days of faily heavy shooting and it was up to the challenge. It's much, much better than buying alkaline batteries."
1,Never worked,The Battery looked like a second hand battery signs of leakBattery poles discoloured. Out of country on holiday will return item on return
3,Olympus BLM-01 Lithium-ion Rechargeable Battery,The battery is ok and will probably work fine for years but it is expensive. I did not see the compatibles when I purchased this item or I would have saved a lot of money.
5,Go with the Brand Name,"The knock-off replacement batteries just don't hold as much power. Go for the real deal ""Olympus"" batteries and you will be pleased."
5,2nd battery a must,"Even though the battery lasts a long time (500-600 photos) a spare is a must on a long outing. If you want to keep shooting, download, view pics get a 2nd battery."
4,Olympus BLM-01,A good reliable battery. Always use the battery from the original manufacture of the camera (Olympus). They last longer! I wish they had a Compact quick charger for these batterys. They are a little hard to come by locally. Don't buy clones!
1,Does not work,purchased and returned when found not to work. Item replaced and that one did not work either. The charger would not recognize either one.
1,not happy at all,The item was shipped to me 3 days late and when I received it and try to use it found it was damaged and did not work try to charge it still did not work have tried to Contact your company for over 3 weeks and have not been resolved yet
4,A Solid Battery,"I own the C8080wz and the OEM battery (this one) that came with it is still going strong after several years of heavy use. It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for. I made the mistake of purchasing an off brand version of the battery and from the very start it held a charge for about half the time of the Olympus version. Now it lasts for only a short while before it is depleted. The Olympus battery still is at about 90% of its original capacity which means I can take it out for a day of shooting without worrying about it dying on me.My C8080 is still a terrific camera. You better believe that when I need a replacement battery, I am going to get a BLM-01 next time."
4,Excellent highs and mid-range; pair with a subwoofer,"I am a big fan of polk audio in-wall speakers. This is my first shot using their in-celing speakers. Typical of polk, you can put a lot of power to this speaker and it will not distort. Tried without subwoofer first but missed the punch. Added a passive in-wall sub along with 4 of these and it sounds really great."
3,Quality Classical Mag from Britains BBC,"I'd expect no less -- this is a quality magazine on classical and opera from the BBC. Includes sections on new cds, recording news, bach, orchestral, choral, chamber, video, jazz, books and more."
4,Durable set. Easy to put away/store.,"I think this is a very nice set for the price. It's well constructed and the fact that you can just flip the board over, dump all the pieces in, and fold it in half means even my 9 year old can easily keep it put away when not in use (and not lose pieces). The pieces are smallish, but the description is accurate so you know what you're getting. I think it's a very acceptable and well-made first chess set."
2,Not well made,"My daughter immediately noticed that the white queen and king are much smaller than the black's. It is functional, but the pieces are not well made at all. I would rather have well made plastic set."
4,Great little chess set!,"I really like this chess game. The format is really practical if you want to take it places of if you live somewhere where you can't have it on display all the time. Even thought it's box chess set, it doesn't feel cheap or bad quality. The pieces are heavy and look good.The only thing I would have liked is to have an actual durable pouch to put the pieces in, instead of just a plastic one. A fabric pouch would have gotten this set 5 stars.Pros:- practical- feels more expensive than actual price- doesn't take much room- sturdyCons:- plastic pouch"
4,Chess Set,The chess set is great as a larger travel size set. Make sure to see the product dimensions as I forgot to and found the set smaller than I expected hence I now use it as a travel set.
5,great game,"This is always a great game, and the board and the pieces ahave good size and are excelent for a kid"
2,dissapointed,It is smaller than it looks like. The pieces are falling easily. No numbers or letters on the board like they should be. If you want to teach your kids real chess don't buy this set. It is not worthy. And pretty expensive for what are you getting.
2,This chess set is overpriced and flawed.,"I purchased this set expecting something very nice, hence the hefty $16 price tag. I was very disappointed. The pieces don't stand even, and easily tip over. The kings and queens are top-heavy so they constantly fall over and the board doesn't sit even because the latch is larger than the board. Pass on this, invest in a nice one."
2,Feels cheap,Wood? Yes. Classic? Uhh...no. It's a cheap chess set and feels like it. I'd have preferred a plastic one that was better made.Don't buy this.
2,Mistake,"I thought this would be an ok chess set to use to play chess with my grandson. However, I find that the slightest bump and pieces fall over and off the board. I'm going to get a better one."
1,"Good product, bad quality control","Decent set, carving is good, finishing is goodBut missing the castle piece - extra pawn given.Good product but order if you are willing to return if not complete"
2,So small!!,"In the picture it looks comfortably big, but in reality it is so small. The pieces are also too small and badly carved. I cannot differentiate between a king and pawn! (well, thats an exaggeration, but you get the point.)"
2,Unweighted Pieces,I gave this product a 2 star rating because the most useful element of a chess board and pieces is that the pieces do not fall over easily. These pieces easily fall over taking 5 other pieces with it......
4,Perfect for Beginners,"It is perfect for children 8 & up. Sturdy made, easy storage. Perfect first chess board for beginning Bobby Fishers."
3,Decent set for the price,"Pieces are kinda flimsy and the board won't lay totally flat because of the design. But for the price, it gets the job done."
5,"So far, so good","My new Brooks B17 is still in the ""wearing in"" phase but has been wonderful so far. I've been on two 50 mile rides since putting it on, and haven't had any discomfort. The saddle also looks very nice on my bike. The product arrived right on time, even with Saturday delivery."
5,Yes it is that good,"I research products I buy and this was no exception. The majority of crazy long distance riders prefer this saddle, so I parted with the cash and was not let down. It was 80 to 90 percent comfortable right out of the box, which was better than my 3 other bikes. After 500 to 700 miles it broke in and is 100% great now. After 2 thousand miles it looks like new and feels great! Totally satisfied."
5,Class and comfort,"Classic style, unsurpased comfort - i'm sure not everyone is best served by a slab of leather, I didn't think it would be comfortable either... Reading reviews, you'll see why I bought one... Once it forms to your sit bones, it becomes a part of you."
4,This is a good choice for long distance riding,"I drank the Brooks cool-aid several years ago. I find the saddle (B17 Std) to be very comfortable and have been very pleased with it. I did not find it necessary to break in the saddle, it was fine on day one. Come to think of it, I have ridden on a lot of saddles with no problems, so I might not be a super good judge with it comes to this aspect of saddle selection. I can tell you it looks good and it carries some prestige that you don't get with the other saddle choices. I ride a full on touring bike with front/rear racks, barcon shifters, ATB gearing, the works. I really had no choice; I had to get a Brooks didn't I."
5,Brooks B-17 Standard Saddle,"I had read and heard so many good things about the Brooks B-17 saddle, but was always a little skeptical. After trying to survive my old saddle and suffering with so much pain, I decided to take the plunge. WOW!!! The difference in comfort is too much to believe. My first ride was 5 miles without padded shorts...no problem. My next rides were 15, 20, 25 miles; I've had to stop at this point due to some surgery, but I couldn't ride around the block, with padded shorts, before the Brooks B-17. I don't have the words to express the comfort. It really is the most comfortable saddle, on a bike, you will ever ride.If you're tired of the discomfort from your bike saddle, make the change and buy your Brooks saddle through Amazon. Amazon had the best prices and I couldn't believe the turnaround time, delivery, on the saddle...within 7-days."
3,Brooks,Product is great. I love my Brooks and I HIGHLY recommend it. I wouldn't pay for the expedited shipping because if I bought from this seller again because it didn't ship for multiple days after I placed the order so I wasn't able to use it on some practice rides I was hoping to use to break it in before some longer group rides. Otherwise it's a great product at an excellent price.
1,Not good for Win98SE,"Despite a statement on the package, I could not install for Win98SE just like other reviewers. The card looks identical to one marketed by DYNEX which does not work either. Neiter manufacturer provides any support"
2,fun while it lasted,"it was fun for about a month, but then the wheels were falling off and the steering wheel broke and couldn't be fixed. i wouldnt pay more than $30 for it."
2,Pretty flimsy,This product is not very easy to assemble and is pretty flimsy overall. I would spend a little bit more money and buy something of better quality that won't fall apart on your child.
3,Overpriced,"It is a shame to pay this kind of money for something they used to supply with the saw blades. I sure it will work, but come on folks these used to be free with the saw blades. It is not much more than a $0.50 bushing/washer, unfortunately it is not included with the blades anymore and not available at HD, Lowes or Sears, so what choice do we have? Damn freight more than the part."
1,bushing oversized,"I purchased this bushing to use on a Craftsman sliding miter saw. I also purchased a brand new Freud blade for the saw. The inside diameter worked fine. But the outside diameter (OD) measured 1.004. The saw blades run between 1.001 and 1.002. This means that the bushing would not fit in the new Freud blade or the old Craftsman saw blade. I ended up carefully grinding the OD that measured between .998 and 1.000. I was a machinist in a previous career, and realize the bushing I could be out of round by a few thousands. but it seems to work. What upsets me is that I paid 9 times more than Freud's competitors bushing. I could have spent 99 cent for a poorly manufactured bushing instead of 9 dollars. Stay away from this bushing."
3,Muscle Car DVD,"The Video is good quality and is a collection of shows that were on SPEED Chanel over the past few years with the commercials removed. However, the Amazon price of $26.99 is way out of line. The exact video is available on line at MPI home Video for $14.95."
4,GOOD BOOK> VERYEDUCATIONAL,"This book of ""Washington and his Comrades in Arms"" shows how he helped shape the U.S. and what accompishments he made for us. He was recruited by the Continental Congress for command of the army. He fought many difficult battles to to determine the outcome of the war. Many opposing forces stood in his way, for example, General Cornwallis and his gigantic battlaion. The knowledge and strength of Washington helped him defeat lots of obstacles and further him and his army to more victories. His strong leadership helped him win one of the most significant battles in history, the battle at Yorktown. Coming back to Philadelphia, many citizens cheered Washington winning all he could. This book is a great way to learn much about the life of Washington in the army."
4,"Solid music, vocals can be overpowering","Sometimes Mr. Cincotti's voice doesn't have enough depth or something indefinable for me. I'm no musician, but it seems to lay on top of the music rather than being a part of it. That said, I enjoy this album, and On the Moon is, for me, one of the better cuts from it."
2,don't bother,"With all of the hype about this guy I expected a much better CD. He is somewhere between a Harry Connick Jr. 'wanna-be' and a Barry Manilow 'wanna-be' without the voice of either. I give it 2 stars for the nice sounding string arrangements. All in all, play it softly at a dinner party and it won't bother anyone."
3,Good Title Track,"I love the title track to this cd. Beyond that I don't find much to distinguish it. It's not bad, in fact, for the most part, pretty enjoyable. If you are able to choose any jazz cd I'd recommend trying something else. If you are at Wal-Mart and the selection is pretty limited and you are curious (my circumstance when I picked this up) than go ahead. I'd like to hear a little more spontaneity and a little less production. I suspect Mr. Cincotti can play the piano a little bit; it'd be nice if they would let him provide a touch more evidence. At the risk of throwing the names of legends around, the vocals kept reminding me of Chet Baker. Not your normal vocal technique, but interesting and even pleasant."
3,"Has its great moments, raw talent with a great future","The album opens up very strongly with the upbeat St. Louis Blues, one of the highlights of the album. St. Louis Blues is a cheerful, jazz jam play with wonderful arrangements, piano and vocals.After St. Louis Blues the results are mixed as Cincotti ventures into different styles and goes from Jazz to Swing to pop ballads. Even if you are flexible enough the mix can catch you off guard.The album has great moments and those are enough to have you excited about's Peter's bright future. He still needs to find a more solid style both musically as well as vocally; but the raw talent is definitively there.If you would like to try a few tracks, I recommend ""St. Louis Blues"", ""I Love Paris"" and ""Raise the Roof"", if you are in an upbeat mood; and ""He's Watching"" and ""On the roof"" if you are in the mood for nice, slow ballads."
2,Pete's not lovelier the second time around,"We saw Peter Cincotti twice in NYC, and was blown away both times. Bought his first CD and recommended it several times, anxiously awaiting this one.We couldn't be more disappointed. Cincotti's piano playing is true virtuosity, but his singing just isn't up to where it needs to go. Bali H'ai is one of the most unfortunate choices I have ever heard on an album - almost unlistenable. The rest aren't much better. I'd like to put the onus on his handlers for letting him make this one - I just hope it doesn't sink him, because I still believe he has a great future."
4,Stay True to Yourself,"I wrote glowingly of Peter Cincotti's freshman effort and hailed his promise as an artist. I liked ON The Moon but fear he may be going down the Harry Connick ""road to nowhere"" with this follow-up. Cincotti impressed me with his original compositions and unique take on the classics in his first CD. This effort is more uneven--he shines on the funky ""St Louis BLues"" and on ""I Love Paris"". He is very bland and non-descript on ""Some Kind of Wonderful and "" Up on the Roof"". I enjoy his work but can't help but think Cincotti will rise or fall as an artist in a jazz trio/nightclub setting rather than as a Harry Connick wannabee."
5,Excellent,We purchased this CD over the summer and have been listening to it practically non-stop ever since. Bought it for all the adults on our holiday list this year and got positive feedback from everyone.
2,Very unfortunate,"I loved his first CD. This one exposes all the weaknesses -- a mediocre voice and lack of depth, included -- while giving short shrift to his many strengths. The standout is ""raise the roof."" It swings and has an original modern jazzy appeal. But too many songs here are pop shlock that could have been taken straight out of a Disney soundtrack. Pete, make a U-turn fast and don't try to become a Michael Bolton! You have the potential to be a great jazz vocalist."
1,a Poor Man's Harry Connick Jr,Peter Cincotti is trying to find himself as a Artist but albums as these don't speak of where he is heading but show whom He tried to pattern himself after but is doing a low-budget take on it.He ain't Harry Connick Jr. Cincotti has a aight voice&alright on the Piano but He just ain't got the hype that has come with his name.to much polish&shine but nothing of substance in here yet musically to speak of.
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Wow....Peter Cincotti's CD to me really fell short of all the press and product placement he's been receiving. He apparently has been deemed ""the new Harry Connick Jr."". Are you kidding? I don't know if this proclamation came from his own publicity folks or not (though I tend to guess that's probably the case), but regardless, it couldn't be any more inaccurate of a description. Cincotti's piano playing is fair - however, his vocals need a lot of work. It's not a bad voice....it just needs lots of work. As it is right now, he sounds more like a decent karaoke singer than a real jazz vocalist. He's young, so hopefully over time he will improve. However in the mean time, the amount of mediocrity flooding the music scene in general continues to be frustrating. Unfortunately, Cincotti's contribution doesn't help matters. One final thought - a nice cover photo does not make a great musician."
3,GrownUpMusic.com Recommended!,"If jazz artists improve with age, 21-year-old Peter Cincotti might by a legend by the time he hits 30. On his sophomore disc, he proves he's more than just Harry Connick: The Next Generation. He's not afraid to take risks (imagine Rodgers & Hammerstein ""Bali Ha'i"" with a funky blues groove), walking the finest line between pop and jazz. His take on ""You Don't Know Me"" is equal parts Ray Charles and Billy Joel, but his rendition of Carole King's ""Up On the Roof"" is far more optimistic and romantic than any of its previous incarnations. And his original composition, ""On the Moon,"" has Meg Ryan romantic comedy theme song written all over it. "" This song alone is worth the price of the CD."
2,I really WANTED to like this cd....,"I really liked Peter Cincotti's first cd, and was looking for more of those clean, almost sparse, little-trio-in-a-smoky-bar arrangements. I found this to be over-orchestrated and overproduced. No smoke, no sizzle."
3,"A little more pizazz, please","Cincotti's first album was a whirling frolick on piano and vocals through some old favorites and some new additions among jazz and swing repertoire. ""On the Moon"" still delivered great music but was a little less than I expected as this artists second album.His compositions and instrumental arrangements are exquisite (with the exception of the harmonica in Bali H'ai). His own composition ""He's Watching"" seems the best song on the album to me as it's his own creation and he pours the passion into the vocals and instrumentals. I think the bluesy energy for this song may have carried over into the rest of the album making songs like ""Raise the Roof"" and ""I Love Paris"" a little to wistful for the swinging style one would ahve predicted he deliver them with.It's still a good album though, and I look forward to his next album in hopes of another great compilation of original and classic swing."
4,Magill's History of Europe,"I have had to use this book for a paper I had to write about European History. It was very informative, and I found a large majority of the info I needed out of this book, I would reccomend it. The only thing that kept it from getting five stars, was the fact that it got a bit boring at some times."
3,"warning, description incorrect","I purchased this item over others because it used 2 AA batteries vs. AAA that most others used. I am disappointed to find that the description is incorrect. It actually requires 2 AAA batteries. I have a lot of AA batteries on hand all the time for my other electronics, but seldom keep AAA. Hopefully it won't eat through batteries. Time will tell..."
3,uvz sanitizer,"Good overall quality and built. price okWould have liked bigger size lamp, uv lamp actionable by button instead of when closing the lid. if close the lid with box empty lamp still goes on. after not used for 3-4 days lamps takes some time to go on"
2,Not Dependable,"The UV light has a mind of its own when it comes to turning on. Tried changing batteries, but it makes no difference. Nice concept, but functions poorly."
5,One of my Top 5 all-time Christmas CD's,"Our family has an extensive collection of holiday music CD's we've collected over the last 15 years.This album, Rockapella Christmas, always makes it into everyone's favorite to listen to. We all love it. They have beautiful voices and are perfectly in key and in tune and harmony with each other. It is a pleasure and a joy. I highly recommend it to anyone."
2,A lot of talent wasted,"These guys are very talented singers. There is no disputing that. But there's no variety in the arrangements. Sometimes it sounds like you're listening to one depressingly long track. They do try something different at the very end with ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch,"" but you're already tired of it before you get to this one.They took ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,"" a very pretty song, and mixed in some Glow Worm? In my opinion, this doesn't work at all. And the lyrics on the original tracks... Ouch. Here's a line from ""Christmas Without You:""""I hop on a train to Macy's,Thinkin I'll just replace thesememories we made together.But all the memory shelves are bare.""That's right. It does say ""memory shelves."" This is the kind of Christmas CD you want to put on in the background when people are talking and only half listening. It's very pretty, unless it has your full attention."
4,Get it for the Grinch,"A capella music is an extraordinary genre. Nowhere else does the pure, unassisted voice get to show off its versitility. Instruments are unnecessary to the skilled performers of Rockapella. That being said, their contribution to the all too often oversaturated class of holiday standards deserves to stand out from most of the pack. Their arrangements are complex and compelling, but the stand out, for me, was the final track, ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch."" Taking a beloved rhyme from the incomparable Dr. Seuss, Rockapella has layered a dance rhythm with strong ""drums"" over it and given us a gift for the whole year. Most of the other tracks don't try to be so pop oriented and they offer a pleasant variety of musical styles that aren't what is expected for such familiar songs."
5,You will listen over and over,Wonderful music and harmonies. I think that I listen to this CD more than any other that I own.
5,The sound of these guys cannot be compared!!!,"This CD is so much fun to listen to. I love the sound these 5 guys have put together. Ever since my daughter watched ""Where is Carmen SanDiego"", (they were a regular there), I have enjoyed listening to the rhthyms (sp) and harmonies they create. I especially LOVE the ""Grinch"" song. How anyone can have that base voice so low..is beyond me! Buy it! you won't be sorry you did!"
5,Heavenly Harmonies!,"If you are a fan of tight knit harmonies, then you will absolutely LOVE ""The Christmas Album"" by Rockapella. Their talent for a cappella performances is beyond anything you could ever imagine. Scott Leonard shares leads with Kevin Wright, Elliott Kerman, and Barry Carl, who does an incredible rendition of ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch"", with Jeff Thacher providing the always amazing vocal percussion sounds! You will not be disappointed in your purchase of ""The Christmas Album"" and I can venture to say it will be a favorite among your holiday listening pleasures!"
3,thick cuts dies,these boxes were much smaller than I expected. It would have been helpful to have the measurements in the description.
2,Mush pure mush.,A typical romance novel. I bought it thinking a Gerritsen book would be one I would like. did not know that she wrote romance novels. I was looking for a rizzoli isle. Type bookShirleymae.grigas@gmail
3,"Good, it is a romance novel.","While I love Tess Gerritsen, I am not fond of romance novels. So this book was good if you are into romance! I like it better when Tess writes mystery. Then she always gets 5 stars! I really did not know it was romance when I purchased it. I always buy books written by Tess. In the future I will just know to delve a little deeper into the storyline before I purchase. It wasn't a bad book, just not my category!"
1,Surprised,"I was happy to see a new title from one of my favorite authors and actually purchased two at the same time. As I read, I realized that these were older editions that were given new published dates. This is a dishonest transaction. Why should readers have to become sleuths to ascertain the validity of material presented by Kindle?You should refund the purchase price to any of us who were disappointed with these subpar editions."
1,Republications,"I almost ordered this book because I'm an avid Tess Gerritsen fan; thankfully I read the reviews first and found out it's a reprint of one of her earlier works. It's a pet peeve of mine that titles are often released under new covers and sometimes even new titles. Many times I've purchased a book by a favorite author, only to discover that I already have it from 10-15 years ago. Amazon, please be forthright about listing these reprints as REPRINTS so all of us who love to read will be forewarned!"
3,A predictable book,"This was a romance with some mystery thrown in. THere were no real clues for the reader to figure out who done it before hand, yet it was predictable and unbeleiveable. I had to finish it to find out who did it. I was dissatisfied with the unbeleivable love story and the culprit. No one would ever do the things the characters did. Easy read. Very easy. Took me a few hours even with interuptions."
4,Guilty of being stupid,"Miranda had an affair with a married man. Her was stabbed to death in her bed. The police believe they have found the murderer. Miranda. Someone secretly posts Miranda's bail and now someone is trying to kill her. Enters her ex-lover's brother, he was certain that Miranda was guilty. But when he discovers someone is trying to kill her and there's more to the story than what it seems he starts to believe in her innocence and trys to find the murderer. The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was the story was too predictible."
4,Great book,"Excellent story line and interesting characters a good read to help me distress, which is my favorite part of reading Tess Gerritsen books they bring ou right in to the story."
2,"I'm sorry, but...","The thing is, I picked up this book after throughoutfully enjoying Gerritsen's medical thrillers (I figured they'd feature the same gripping story-telling) but what I found was a lukewarm novel, filled with two-dimensional characters and a terribly boring plot. The ending was nice, but it wasn't enough to save this book.So... If you read Gerritsen's medical thrillers (Bloodstream, Harvest, etc...) don't expect the same kind of plot, characters or narration in here."
3,"Not her best, but....","This was not the best book by Tess Gerritsen I have ever read, but I must confess that I enjoyed it. It was certainly not as graphic or horrific as 'The Surgeeon' or 'The Apprentice', but it kept my interest. This was almost more of a romance novel and could have lost me at any time, but I stayed with it and found it to be a good story. (could be a Lifetime movie)"
2,1997 reissue,"My fault--I could have checked publishing info, but I still feel tricked. This is an old Harlequin romance/mystery that has been republished now that Gerritsen is famous. It isnt horrible for what it is, but not near the caliber of her present stuff -- which I love."
2,Stupid,"This was a dumb book and I won't read any of her other books after suffering through this one. The main character was insipid. Even though 4 attempts were made on her life, she still sat alone at night in empty houses with no weapons or protection, and her friends/boyfriend left her alone again and again. We all knew she wouldn't be killed anyway, so why all the fake attempts? No surprises, no twists, no reason to waste time reading this at all. Very weak character development."
5,Very Very good book!!,This book was very suspensful! I read this in about 2 days. I highly recomend this book!!
1,Really disappointed. It's a romance - and not a good one.,"Am an avid Gerritsen fan. I love Rizzoli & Isles, the Surgeon, etc. Gerritsen has always been on my must-read list. But Presumed Guilty is a maudlin romance with a transparent mystery in the background. Unworthy of Tess Gerritsen."
2,Presumed Guilty,"Found this book in the library on a cruise ship and read it because I've read some of Gerritsen's books and they were all good. This one isn't. It is one of her earlier works when she had not yet polished her writing skills. As other reviewers have commented, this book was written 15 years ago before she became famous. The plot was largely unbelievable. It involves a woman who is having an affair with a married man and wants to break it off. She comes home to find him stabbed and dead in her bed. She says she is innocent, but she is ""presumed guilty"" hence the title of the book. His brother comes to town and she gets involved with him and he sets about solving the murder. He gets access to school and employment records just by making a phone call. How unbelievable is that? Don't waste your time with this one."
3,review for Presumed Guilty,Presumed Guilty. It's okay. I thought that the two of them falling in love was just a little to much.
3,Re-published,Thus is a book -actually her atempt at romance novels. These are the 1st books she wrote. They're NOT like her current books. With that sad if you e joy a romance once in a while give it a try.
4,NIGHT MOVES,"I LIKE THIS ALBUM BUT I ONLY WANTED ONE SONG. I'M GLAD YOU NOW HAVE MP3 DOWNLOADS. THERE WERE NO SINGLE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS ALBUM.THANKS,ALICE"
2,Unhappy it wasn[t an orginal vynle,"I thought this record would have been an original vynle, it was a copy and I was dissappointed."
5,In A Tie For Bob Seger's Best,"NIGHT MOVES is tied with LIVE BULLET and STRANGER IN TOWN as being one of Bob Seger's three best albums ever. The entire album, with the exception of the mediocre ""Come To Poppa"", is top-drawer. Songs such as ""Rock & Roll Never Forgets"", which extols the joys of rock & roll for full-grown men and women; the title track's description of a high-school romance and its aftermath; ""Fire Down Below"", a song about urban street life; ""Sunburst"", which is about someone who has it made; and ""Sunspot Baby"", which relates a tale of the anger that results from trust betrayed, all unite to form a harmonious whole. The fact that Seger, like virtually every other Midwestern, Southern, and West Coast rocker, advocates efforts to free people unjustly imprisoned in foreign countries, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,Old School Masterpiece,"This was the first album that I ever bought and I still listen to it to this day. There are very few artists that can inflict such emotion into their songs, Bob Seger is one of those artists. Just listen to Night Moves or The Fire Down Below, you can perfectly picture the scenery, landscape, and people he describes. The best song on this masterpiece though is Mainstreet, which continues to be my favorite Seger song. Rock and Roll Never Forgets is a flat out rock anthem that jump starts the album. Overall, an incredible album that you will listen to over and over again. Also check out Stranger in Town another masterpiece....thanks to Ian."
5,Freaking amazing!,"I got this album used, and when it came it was brand new in the wrapping... already provided me with hours of listening pleasure! It was so worth it! (Shipping took a little longer than I was informed, however I live in Canada so that may be the reason)... Great purchase!"
4,Classic Rock and Roll from the Seventies,"This is a classic of Rock and Roll and Seventies music. With truly great tunes and a really hard rocking beat, probably the best of all the Bob Seger albums, this one truly shows off the ability of the band to just truly rock out.There are some great classic rock songs like ""Rock and Roll Never Forgets"" and ""Night Moves"" but also some more sensous laid back tunes like, ""Sunspot Baby"" and ""Mary Lou""I'm not really sure if having the gold disc edition really adds anything, I couldn't tell any difference, but this version does sound a lot better than my old cassette tape version.A good reccomendation for anyone who likes 70's classic rock."
5,Seger's best studio album,"""Night Moves"" is a 1970s American rock classic that holds its own with Bruce Springsteen's ""Born to Run"" as one of the best of that decade. What Seger may have lacked in comparison to Springsteen's epic songwriting, he more than makes up for with his ability to write a good hook and with his energetic performances and great singing. The song ""Night Moves"" has become a classic rock radio staple. But ""Rock and Roll Never Forgets,"" ""Mainstreet,"" ""The Fire Down Below"" and ""Sunspot Baby"" are all first rate songs. Seger still has a bit of a rough edge here that he would lose later on during his more polished ""Like a Rock"" television commercial phase. This album deserves to be in any classic rock fan's collection."
4,Seger's best work,"This album is simply a killer. Bob Seger in those days was playing raw, essential rock and roll at its best.There's not a loser on this whole album, but the title song is a must hear. And ""The Fire Down Below"" is the one of the best workouts a Telecaster will ever get. It's a smoking, hook-filled, howling rock masterpiece. Seger outdid himself on this album and never again reached this high water mark.Don't miss out on Night Moves."
4,Remastered?,"This is a great album. The only complaint I have is the remastering. About 2/3 through the song ""Night Moves"" there is a worbling in and out that sticks out like a sore thumb. It made me cringe. It sounded like a worn out cassette tape. I could've made a CD from an LP that would have sounded better than that mess. To me, it ruined the song. I'll have to listen from the greatest hits I suppose."
5,Great for dancing and lots of fun!,"I bought the original release of this CD in Venezuela the year it came out (1995) and we've listened to it many, many times. It's infectious club dance music with driving bass and a great beat. The vocals, however, are what really make it. The ladies give the male vocalist a hard time (in English), and he takes it well without missing a beat (mostly in Spanish). It's hard to explain, but you end up liking them and wishing you were at the same party. This version appears to be the same as the original except it includes a radio-friendly version of ""Short Dick Man"", and they've left off ""Lamelo"" (Lick It), possibly because the label's management found the topic too hot to handle."
1,Major Disappointment,"After reading the reviews I could not wait to recieve this book.To be honest if it go lost in the mail I would of been happier.Totally disjointed reading, found myself skipping around for lack of grabbing my attention, I ended up moving along to my next book."
5,Robert Mitchum The Signature Collection,"Great selection of Mitchum films. Each film shows Mitchum at his best - especially Macao, Angel Face and Home from the Hill."
5,One Hundred Best Loved Verses bring pleasant memories to life!,It's so fun to turn the pages and read each verse with excitement letting memories of my childhood come alive. How exciting to giggle and laugh aloud while recreating the story with my fingers and hands as my grandson watches on squealing with excitement. The easy to read print and beautiful colorful illustrations make each page come alive and so exciting to look forward to. The hardback cover improves the ease of use for both big and little hands.
5,Love the Book.,"Bought this to go with the ""quilt"", however the ""quilt"" was not what I thought it would be. It was on cloth, not on a quilted material, which is what i wanted."
4,Beautiful Pictures,The book is beautifully illustrated and has a lot of rhymes I remember as a child growing up (1980's). I will say the cover is much brighter than the illustrations in the book. Also there were many rhymes I didn't know but I can't say anything negative about that. Just no nostalgia there.
5,Beautifully illustrated Mother Goose.,"I was very happy with this Mother Goose version for two reasons: the illustrations are of children when the rhymes are about children, and the artwork is very attractive."
3,Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose: One Hundred Best-Loved Verses,"The shipping was very prompt and I received the book just in time for my granddaughter's birthday. The contents of the book are ok, however a few pages in the book were ""glued"" together."
2,Where is the music?,"I bought this CD thinking for my 9-year old child and also for my 1-year old niece, so that we could sing along and learn a bit of English while having fun.But there is no music in the CD. Just a lady's voice reading the verses. Where is the music? Nowhere. My daughter was bored to death, as she could not understand a word.I remember my old days in England when I had a cassette full of sung nurseries rhymes, with excellent music."
2,Don't Like,"I was expecting something else, I'm not to happywith the CD. My expectations were not met."
3,"Best best mother goose, but I don't like the CD","The book is so beautiful and charming, both my 3 year old daughter and me love it very much. The reason why I gave 3 star is I am a bit disappointed with the accompanying CD, we couldn't seperately review the CD only. Maybe it is just me, the voice isn't pretty. There is such a boring introduction (over 5min) in the begining, while the verses are mostly less than 20 seconds long. So go for the book but not the CD."
4,Teaches tolerance to children,Cute book my grand daughter enjoys so much she imitates being a skunk! Very good read to teach tolerance for so many differences among people as well as all the earth's creatures.
3,ok,"I bought this for my 6 year old who recently lost his DS and got a new one for his birthday, works great, lots of pockets for the small games, but the backpack itself is really small. My son is very small for his age and it still looks miniature on him, but he like it anyways."
3,small blueprints for kindle unreadable,"the book itself was informative and well written. I just didn't like the fact that the blueprints were so small and unreadable when I downloaded it for kindle. In kindle for computer app, I was unable to zoom in or print the blueprint. The whole idea for this book was to be able to read the blueprints, so you can start your own project. The hard copy edition would probably be ok. I would suggest staying away from the kindle version."
1,Pocket Cruiser is Totally Rubbish,Don't try to get this book in Kindle Version. U can't see the drawing at all even you enlarge it from your kindle. Regret to dump my hard earn dollar onto it.
4,Wisdom and Common Sense,"As a pediatrician I witness daily how lost parents are in the area of family and parenting. We are now in the second and third generation of parents who were themselves never parented. Many of them have no vision for their children beyond being healthy, happy and having a college education. For the most part the parents of today are completely unaware that there is anything of importance to be given to their children beyond their materialistic needs. Elisabeth Elliot's book gives such parents a glimpse into the past and shows what a family and parents can be. If nothing else it demonstrates how much has been lost. I encourage parents to read this book together and discuss its contents in relation to their own upbringing in addition to their own parenting. My hope is that they will take a hard look at their duty to their children and develop a well rounded vision for their family."
2,ripe review,"not worth the money.i found this film slow and rather uninteresting, not as good as the little girl who lives down the lane."
3,Sick intriguing look into two runaways and their persona,RIPE is a movie that either one likes or doesn't. No middle ground. The two persons have a relationsip that one has let become lesbianic while the other is less committed. Arriving near a military camp they meet an accepted driver. Sparks fly for one but the other gets kicks via rape. Jealousy ensues. The end is bewildering but shows how rounded lives can prevail. I wasn't ready for the close which is powerful. This isn't a movie for sex but its nature is harsh. I rate it 3*** but 2 1/2 is closer. For special taste fans. Acting is okay but we need to know the two persons more individually to prepare for the close and the thoughts afterward that will ensue.
4,The sleazy poster and video box do the film an injustice.,"Ripe is not an exploitative Lolita sex film as the oversaturated key art may suggest. Instead, it is a challenging, offbeat exploration of female sexuality and coming of age, imaginatively directed and well acted by its three leads.The script sometimes gets rocky and crude as with many indie films (too much swearing is a curse in indie scripts), but the film is visually stunning, and the cumulation of small moments is delicious -- when Violet discovers the adult magazines, for example, or when the gruff man who takes the sisters in has to explain menstruation to her. And the final scene with the two sisters is devastating, a weird amalgam of suspense, family drama, and psychosexual overtones.A wonderful music score by Anton Sanko (ex-Suzanne Vega Band) augments this aesthetically excellent, curiously poignant, ultimately very dark film."
2,B Grade let down,"I really expected this to be up to the company it was advertised with, i.e., other films and books. I found it much like you might find on Cinemax or HBO. I expected at least a hint of erotica, but found nothing even close. Unless you call a brief underwear or chest shot thrilling.An inexpenseive price for an inexpensive film."
