2,Poor design...,"Nice looking and I'm sure they're warm and dry, but when zipped open you only get about two inches added opening. Makes it tight to squeeze into the boot and a real chore to stuff pants into there (if you have straight cut jeans they won't fit over the boot). I'm sending 'em back."
5,Love these boots!,These are exactly what I have been looking for and the price was great! Finally...a real leather boot at a reasonable price! Yay Sorel!
4,Great boots!,"I really love these boots...after reading some of the reviews I was skeptical, but gave them the benefit of the doubt....and I'm glad I did! When I first put them on, I got a little discouraged because they seemed to big, however I realized they are made a tiny bit bigger so that they're not too tight with your wool socks. With wool socks they fit perfectly! I wore them to Colorado skiing and they kept my feet perfectly warm! I've walked in them a great deal and they are very comfy - they could use a little bit of arch support, but that is the only critique I have (and that's nothing some inserts can't fix). Great boots!"
4,2 inch Orion Eyepiece Filter Case,"The Orion 4 filter eyepiece case provides a safe way to store multiple eyepiece filters. The 2 inch case is little bit harder to use than the one for 1.25 eyepiece filters, but still offers convenient storage. I recommend it for anyone who has multiple telescope eyepiece filters."
3,"Great artists, but ...","What first comes to mind are atonal compositions, those of Shoenberg and various avant-garde jazz attempts. An essentially experimental and anti-consumerist element seems to exist at the heart of this album, which excites a tension with an equivocally determined ""lounge"" mood.Three stars: when I listen to this album, I hear artists' styles conflicting, where they strive to (or should) complement. Even atonal compositions, the ones worth mentioning, have a sort of ""organic wholeness"" about them that this album, for the most part, seems to lack.I bought this album due to a recent and remarkable intrigue (a gravity) toward Vladislav Delay's ""ambient"" productions (""Demon Tracks"" and ""Whistleblower"" in particular). These albums, among any albums of his other pseudonyms, I highly recommend!"
5,Bible study,No personal library can be complete without books by A. W. Tozer! This book contains some of his best writings.
2,Solder NOT included!,Good for the price but I give it only 2 stars because I needed SOLDER to actually solder a component back on... argh and it doesn't come with solder.
4,Does not contain solder,"The tip is too big for electronics work except for soldering wires together and things where there is lot of space around. But that's not what this tool is primarily for, so no problem with that. Otherwise it works nice, no overheating. But note that the set does not contain any solder. Just 5 tips, stand and a booklet. So order some solder also if you need it."
2,get what you pay for and not true to detail...,"you get what you payed for because after using the solder iron 3 times the tip of the ""universal tip"" has a chip/melted, and in the product description: ""From the Manufacturer- Weller 8 Piece 25-Watt Hobby Iron Kit contains solder iron, tips, solder and instruction leaflet."" there was no solder there is solder iron, tip and instruction leaflet, had to go and buy some solder...it destroyed my purpose of buying the kit when the description said there's solder but there was none..."
1,Crap,I burned my finger more than anything elseI bought it to cut plastic and it really struggled and never really workedMaybe it would work on wood??I threw mine in the trash
3,Mixed Feelings,"On the one hand, I do believe that everyone who is interested in jazz as a musical performer should read this book. I've been doing recording sessions for over twenty years now and even I learned a lot from this book, in the descriptions of the sessions.However, I can't post a review of this book without adding a little rant about the writing style. I REALLY can't stand modern day music journalism with it's over the top hero worship. It's precisely this kind of writing which turned me away from Down Beat and other jazz publications.So, get the book, read the sections about the actual recording sessions, but you may want to skip all that other stuff."
3,Lots of fillers,"Half of the book is great, the part where the author actually writes about the making of Kind of blue and the brief live appearences by the KOB band. Other than that she fills 1/4 of the book taking about Miles carrer up to KOB. Most people whou would buy a book about KOB already know all this stuff. But the really boring part is the last chapter, taking about what was the jazz scene after KOB was released, to finally conclude that none of it had anything to do with KOB. She spents too much time taking about Ornette and co. vs. KOB and there is really no point in it."
4,Heater,"I would just like to say that the heater I got is a very good heater it works great on an old Ford diesel. It makes starting in the winter a whole lot eaiser, and the service I got was great the shipping and the info on where my package was at all times. ""Will be using Amazon again thats for sure."
5,Wow 2000 watts,I installed the smaller 1000w on a geo. I would suggest this one for a Large tractor or a big rig. Worked great on my little car
3,"Ok Cd, Bone still Bone","This cd is a decent colaberation of bpne thugs n harmony's greatest hits, i like chopped and Screwed , but when bone is on it, it just doesnt sound right, bone is a fast pased rapid fire rap group, and its just not their style to do chopped and screwed. so all in all if your a big bone fan, get this cut, if not, dont waste your dollars.Peace, god bless-Big Bezzie"
2,U might not want this unless you like......,"You may not want this CD unless you like Screwed and Chopped music, and you don't care what it is, just as long as it is Screwed and Chopped. Now Michael Watts does a pretty good job on the turntables, but the selection stinks!! It probably has to do with Tamika Wright picking the music. I cannot give it my usual Lyrics and Beats review because these are greatest hits, but I can say that I never liked the song with Phil Collins at the normal beat, so why do I want it slow?! Speed that crap up and get it over with. If you are a true Bone fan and like screwed and chopped, get it, otherwise, you're not missing much."
2,Surprisingly Well-Made,"""Transmorphers: Fall of Man"" is a prequel to the original ""Transmorphers"" movie. TFoM feels like two different movies. The first movie is an apparently successful repelling of the rise of the robots. Of course, the alien robots that control the drones do arise, and that is the second half of the movie.The special effects are nothing to cheer about, but they do work. The script is tight and coherent for an Asylum movie. Bruce Boxleitner supports the first half of the movie. The movie kind of falls apart after that, but it moves toward the logical conclusion.Yes, TFom is a bad movie. It is more of an action movie than its predecessor, and it is better made in all respects. It is worth watching just to see what happened before Transmorphers, if that means anything."
1,Not worth it,"I rented this movie and can say it was a waste of funds to film it, Poor Acting, Poor Graphics.. some hot women, wished they showed more of, but all i can say is wait till a friend has it and borrow it. at least its free then but i still say its a waste of time doing."
1,DO NOT RENT!!,"Please DO NOT rent this movie. This is a scam. A terrible scam. Horrible acting, horrible scenario and even more horrible special effects."
2,2 stars cause its so Bad it's Funny!,"Transmorphers: Fall Of ManWhen a super species of deadly robots begins to wage war against the planet, Humankind fights back.In a movie this bad you are cheering for the Robots to end it all.....Quickly!This a B movie. Definitely struggled with a limited budget and bad script. A few of the performances are not terrible but when you surround it with amateur looking special effects and a lot of bad acting it gets kinda funny. This is a movie you just goof on and enjoy the moments of the final director cut and wonder to yourself.....""Does he know how bad this is?""Its kinda funny for a pretty bad movie. But I KNEW that going in and I did get a few laughs out of it . So not all bad."
4,You have to buy the mounting hardware too!,"Ok, found out the hard way, your going to have to buy an extra 130 bucks or so (or more) worth of specifice mounting hardware for your particular vehical to get this rack to work. Other than that the rack is great, just wish that the discription had listed that you need the additional mounts. Be sure and check the SURCO's website and the application guide to find out what exactly you will need."
5,I wish this was still available!,I have all of the mp3 clip previews of this album and I LOVE it. I heard Illusive on Digitally Imported and loved it. I would love to buy this CD! I wish I could. It's gorgeous.
5,"Good old trance, highly recommended","PLAT 20 CD is the second compilation from the world's most consistently great trance label, Platipus Records. Among the ten unmixed tracks are several classics from 1993 to 1995. Art Of Trance's ""Octopus"" is a monumental masterpiece, and other songs are also aurally gratifying.Here is the full track listing: Robert Miles ""Children (Dream Version)"" [7:36], Poltergeist ""Vicious Circles (Union Jack Remix)"" [7:00], The Art Of Trance ""Octopus (Man With No Name Remix)"" [7:15], Salamander ""Tempest (Union Jack Remix)"" [7:12], Union Jack ""Red Herring (Original Mix)"" [8:37], Catalyst ""What?"" [7:33], Quietman ""Plastic Gourd (10 Inch Mix)"" [7:06], The Art Of Trance ""Octopus (Original Mix)"" [8:35], Union Jack ""Cactus"" [9:45], The Art Of Trance ""Orange"" [7:39]. The last track was the B-side to ""Octopus"", and as far as I know this is its only CD appearance."
2,A real let-down,"Whether Lily was reticent to bad-mouth her childhood digs or the author and editor left her pithier comments out of the final edit, this commentary has virtually no values attached to it. I'm sure Ms. Tomlin has a lot to say about Detroit, the government's abandonment of cities, her mixed feelings about revisiting her old neighborhood. Sadly, none of that is here."
2,Half is Useless and a quarter of it is for elementary children,"Unless your middle school child can't spell bread, eggs and cheese and can't match them to pictures, dont get his DVD package. I got this for my child to practice his composition skills, but the program does not present organized exercises and clutters information in the form of mediocre graphics. The online support is ridiculous and adds nothing to the learning experience.It comes with a picture dictionary... something a middle school student does not need. My son uses a normal dictionary for reference.The only redeeming feature in this collection are the DVD pseudo-documentaries and almanac. For 45 dollars though, it's a rip-off. There are better pencil & paper workbooks available in bookstores. This collection is presented in a deceptively organized package but is actually a collection of second-rate software."
1,What a joke!,Thank goodness I did not pay very much money for this because it was nothing that it claimed it would be. It claimed to have subjects that your child would go to and learn but my kids could never even find the lessons on the CD ROMS! Basically they are just math games. It would be nice if you could pick what you wanted to play but you cant eve do that!
3,WAY TOO BIG FOR HOME USE,"This thing was a monster. Too big to fit into my sink or dishwasher. Really, you need to be a restaurant to want to use it. I packed it right up and sent it back losing $20.00 in the return process for restocking fee. Also, I had called BroilKing before I purchased and specifically asked them if the interior silver lining of the pot came out for easy wash. They said yes, but the only thing that came out was the steamer basket, not the interior lining. So there would be no way to dump this huge heavy steamer over to clean out the main chamber."
1,The locket,"Simplistic writing, one dimensional characters, predictable plot. Easy read if you want something you can read on a three hour plane trip and throw away when you're done. Not for the discerning reader."
1,unhappy camper,"I ordered this book DEC 17TH for a christmas gift, still hadn't recieved it in January, I let the seller know, they told me to return it for a refund which I did January 4th when I finally recieved IT. As of january 26th STILL have NOT recieved a refund. CMON MAN get a clue"
2,"Not a ""guy's"" book","The reviews were uniformly quite good for this novel, so I decided to give it a try. The story starts out slowly and takes some time to work up a bit of interest. The central character is a twenties-something working in a nursing home. Not typically the setting for a compelling plot.A quick read-not one of my favorites."
4,Great book,My sister recommend this book and I really enjoyed it. I might read it again someday and then pass it on.
2,Disappointed,This is a used book purchase. Numerous pages were very wrinkled. Appears the book was stored improperly that pages were allowed to be pushed up.
5,"Wonderfully sentimental and touching, yet so poignant!","I love a book that draws you right into the heart of each character. I also appreciate a story that envelopes you like familiar embrace. There was something about each character that touched a part of life's experiences in a way that touched the reader's life. This story has so much to teach the reader about the importance of each stage of life and the choices we make. Esther's diary entries at the beginning of each chapter are simple yet thought-provoking. The relationship between Michael and each of the other characters in the story, seem often improbable, yet always inspiring. A beautifully woven tapestry!"
5,The Locket won't let you down,"Since I have read his other books: The Christmas Box, The Timepiece, The Letter, and The Carousel, I knew what to expect from Richard Paul Evans. He is a truly remarkable mastermind and The Locket won't let you down. It is such a wonderful story filled with romanticism and immense substance. His primary characters are spontaneous and so distinct, it's fun to read how they correspond. You feel remorseful at one moment, then condemn them the next. The theme of this book is allegiance, passion, and sympathy that touches your sensitivity and consciousness to the median. In conclusion, I just have to say that I think this is the type of book that readers can devour as well as learn from. I'm looking forward to next book by Richard Paul Evans."
4,For all with a passion for the Eagles or sports broadcasting,"Merrill Reese is an icon in Philadelphia. He has always come across as a passionate fan and a dedicated, prepared sports broadcaster. His masterful radio broadcasts of Eagle games help his listeners watch the game in their minds. With this book, Reese goes far beyong the games, allowing the reader to view his team and sports broadcasting through his eyes, and what a view! Everyone loves to get the skinny on things, and Reese doesn't disappoint. The book is a very quick read for not only Philadelphia Eagle fans, but for those looking to get into sports broadcasting as well. In my opinion, it should be required reading for all those former athletes turned broadcasters, yet have little knowledge of how to communicate. Maybe they would come to understand Reese's passion, professionalism, and command of the English language, and why Philadelphia Eagle fans turn down the volume on the television and turn up Merril Reese on the radio."
2,ITS BAD!!!!,"This book was not what I expected. Im a huge eagles fan and had liked reese but this book changed my mind. The funniest chaptor is the one titled ""my guy, my pick"". Reese tells us all how great a certain failed player is and how his influence picked him for the eagles. Reese also talks about how the players respect him when in fact my brother was a memeber of the team in the late 80's to mid 90's and constantly said that reese was a running ""joke"" in the locker room, he was known as the mosqiuto for being an annoying pest. Buyer beware."
4,to begin I love macaulay..,"..as much as someone who's never met him can. I think he is intriquing in his choices, and I patiently awaited this book since I heard about it quite a while ago.It's not so much a book, as stated already, but more of an insider's look into his brain. For anyone that has ever wanted to get to know a so called ""untouchable"" without actually knowing them, this is a pleasant fix, but not too deeply intimate.I very much enjoyed it, and hope more people will read it aswell."
1,sincere but very very bad writing,"To start with, I'm not faulting Culkin for getting his feelings out or expressing himself creatively. Nor am I minimizing the emotional turmoil of his childhood and its resultant scars on his psyche.What I AM faulting, however, is his (and the publisher's) decision to publish this. Everbody has the equivalent in an old spiral notebook from 7th grade stashed in a closet. If Culkin wasn't Culkin it never would have escaped. Its not enlightening, its not compelling, there's nothing here that's fresh or inspiring. Its just a guy working out his emotional ""issues"" (like most have) with clumsy bad awkward pretentious writing (again, like most have)."
2,Mostly a mess,"Apart from two passages where he seems to seriously write about his family/father situation, this book was a ridiculous mess. It would have served Mr. Culkin better had he taken himself seriously and wrote a memoir, because it does seem he can write well, from the couple of ""real"" parts of the book that remember moments from his life and address his father. Additionally, the references to being ""Monkey Monkey Boy"" were quite depressing, and conveyed well. I'll keep an eye out for his next effort, but if it looks anything like this, I'll give it a pass."
5,Book recieved in great condition...,I ordered the Macauley Culkin book Junior new and that is exactly what I received. A new book. I am very pleased with how the sender packed it as well. I am very happy with the purchase. Thank you.
3,Macaulay Culkin's Junior,"This is a good read for a person with an excellent attention span. It does start off pretty slow, but in the end I would say i thoroughly enjoyed the book. It has notes, drawings, lists, Culkin's past, and more. Some of the parts made me laugh, and even cry."
1,"Oh, Macaulay no.","Complete and utter drivel. Thoughtless, self-important, and lazy. This is not a real book."
2,Too much walk-throw/screenshot based,"This book was defined as a reference and tutorial, but I have found it to bee too much screeshot based. As an analogy I could say this book has too many phrases similar to ""click on the VIEW button to view the details"". These things are redundant and I would have preferred to obtain deeper level details instead of high level.This book is too much oriented on the admin console of Websphere, instead of detailing the whole variety of possible system configurations. I have sincerely found the freely available IBM Redbooks more useful."
3,A good book for WebSphere Administrative Scripting,I found the title of the book a bit misleading. Though it provides a very high level overview of WebSphere system from administration point of view it mainly focuses on wsadmin scripting (which is then explained well).
5,Works Very Well,"I've bought 3 of these for full-size violins. I've had excellent success with them for the most part. One violin did require some adjustment of the bridge height, and I shaved it down some. On my electric violin it didn't work out very well, but I've been very happy with these bridges."
4,nice,"like it, worth what i payed for. i digged the color too went along well with my black electric violin."
3,just okay,"im more of a vampire girl.....was okay read, but too slow for me, i like the action of the brotherhood!"
3,Jessica Bird aka J R Ward,Same remarks as the last Jessica Bird Novel I reviewed. This is not my favorite genre since I like mysteries and paranormals as a general rule rather than love stories.
1,Nothing like her other books~Uninteresting,"I loved Jessica Bird's ( JR Wards) other books. I read all the Black Daggar Brotherhood books and then read a couple of her non-vampire books and really loved those as well. I am a horse lover and breeder, so from the start that part was interesting for me. But it got a little ridiculous and unrealistic and then the horse part no longer mattered. The romance part just plain bored me. I can't even remember all the details now, but I quit reading on page 73 of a 370 page book.Like other readers, I was not invested or interested in the characters. I am normally curious enough to force myself to read further, but not this time. Too bad this was a total flop compared to her other work. Don't waste your time."
4,Sighs,I loves the chemistry that both characters had as they met and JR Ward does not dissappoint in the sensual department. She definetly does not dissappoint and I hate that I read through it so fast!
1,boring,"I really thought this would be well written, but it failed miserably. Plodding, predictable. I like other J.R. Ward stuff but this was bad."
2,NOT up to her standards,"In fact, way below J.R. Ward (Jessica Bird) standards. Slow. Monotonous. Childish characters. I almost couldn't finish it. Could have been a wonderful story if developed well. I love horses. I ride. Was so looking forward to a good story. Sometimes I wonder just WHO writes these books. One will be great then another is scraping the bottom of the barrel."
4,Best camera Available under $100,"I have bought and used numerous digital cameras beginning in 1992. This little beauty with its many settings takes wonderful outdoor pictures in good light and mediocre pictures in low light, as expected. On rechargeable AAA batteries, I have gotten well over 100 pictures. It is small, sylish, light, comes with a nice case and cables. Overall, a nice nice camera for the price."
3,Batteries Dead in 3 hours,"The camera is cute, takes decent pictures and would be great if the batteries lasted longer. We just received the camera and the batteries died in 3 hours! I'm returning the camera today. It's not worth it."
1,No one likes to admit wasting one's time . . .,reading a bad book. I'm quite certain that's why so many Amazon readers' reviews are positive.I don't mind admitting I wasted my time on this book. Perhaps the steady menu of snarky comments about the people and the weather can pass for wit. Perhaps not.The thing I can't seem to fathom is if Newby dislikes bicycles so much then why did he bother?
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I've had to force myself to read this book. I feel the summary on the back cover is misleading in stating, ""Woven into the narrative is a wealth of information about Irish history and custom ...."" It should state, ""Woven into the wealth of information about Irish history and custom ... are his adventures."" This reads more like a history book than a narrative of his adventures. I found myself skimming over the pages trying to find sections about his actual adventures. If you really like history, this book is for you. Niall Williams and Christine Breen's trilogy of their new life in Ireland is far better than this book."
2,low mileage from Low Gear,"can't help but agree with another reviewer and concur that this book neither inspires nor stimulates, an unexpected experience with Eric Newby's writing. The occasional and unwelcome slide into condescension displayed might well be a reflection of the author's mood. I suspect this might have resulted from an almost unbelievably bad choice of travel timing for a book of this nature. Ireland, in winter, on a bicycle? As gloomy a metereological prospect as the literary result. Try Tony Hawkes' 'Round Ireland with a Fridge' for an infinitely more enjoyable read."
1,A pig in a poke,"I found this book very disappointing. It is neither a travel book or a history book. Eric Newby's positive approach to life and adventure seems to be missing in this book and I found his attitude towards the people, the weather, the condition of B&B's, the roads and the food very condescending. His complaints about his bicycle sounded to me like a bad workman blaming his tools. Even if you have 21 gears you still need the skills to use them. Why oh why does he complain about the weather when he chooses to cycle around the westernmost outpost of Europe in Winter? Want a good cycling book? Then try Miles from Nowhere with a sympathetic author who gets into more serious scrapes and comes out of them with better grace and humor than the Newbys."
3,Poppit Show not worth $20,I have the game it is fun but it dosent take long to go through the ranks and before you know it you have completed it. I finnished it very quickly. In my opinion its not worth paying $20.
1,won't load in my computer,"this game will not work with out the disk ,what a pain.many friends tryd to load it and it wont load. do you have any idea's. HELP"
4,World Geography,"As a homeschooler, I found it easy to finish. It was colorful and easy to read, I learned a lot from reading this."
3,Good rugged watch,"Good rugged watch. I wear it 24/7. Never take it off, minus airport security. That being said the velcro strap is showing some signs of wear. Zero issues with the watch getting moisture in it with showering and the pool.My only gripe is the illumination is very poor. I simply can not read it in the dark. If not for that I would have given it a 5. If you have to have a watch you can see in the dark, your probably going to want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, great rugged little watch."
5,great watch,"Quality of watch is very good and the functions works as expected. Head turner but the strap feels soggy after wearing in the rain, a resin strap should solve this problem."
3,A big disappointed.,"I love watches, don't ask I just do. The S&W SWW 11B GLOW watch is perfect for what I need. It's a heavy watch made to take punishment. My only complaint, it was made in China which was a big disappointment to me to know that S&W would have any of thier products made over seas."
3,OK item,"good item, saved money buying online as opposed to from a local vendor. Item worked well for it's purpose, would purchase from this vendor again in the future."
2,Eh.,"Pretty sturdy, but I've had mine for a few months and the velcro band is coming slightly unglued. Doesn't affect functionality but it certainly doesn't look new now."
5,Have never met a cat that didn't like this food,"I have four cats at home and they love this stuff. If they were in charge of shopping for their own food, this is what they would buy along with freeze-dried chicken treats. I've fostered occasionally for rescue and I've never encountered a cat that didn't take to this food immediately. The main risk with it is that your cats' taste will get hopelessly spoiled and they might start refusing other foods if you tend to feed a variety. For this reason, I use this food sparingly as a treat, generally no more than once a week."
1,White worm & no response from company,"My cat loves this food. It is one of the few canned foods other than the Fancy Feast with the cheese that she will devour immediately.So, imagine my disappointment when I opened one a few weeks ago and there was a white worm in it. Maybe it was a tendon or something, I thought. Nope. It wiggled. It squirmed.I e-mailed the company expressing my shock and disgust and they didn't even respond with an apology.Quality control is obviously nonexistent. Never buying this ever again."
1,Returned Mine!,"This had lousy reception, fell off the wall, and it is not easy to tune to a favorite station; you need to cycle through all the stations that you stored first. Glad I was able to get my money back."
1,awful awful awful,Awful tuner. Awful sound. Awful frustrating. Don't even think of buying this p.o.s.
1,Will Damage your tub surround - DO NOT USE,"My daughters received this radio for Christmas. It is a little short on features with regards to how annoying it is to tune. But, for little kids, they just like to play with it. In any case, all was fine until my wife went to remove it from the shower wall. It turns out that the rubber suction cups that come with the shower bug reacted (rather badly) with the wall of my tub surround. I now have four 1"" cicles melted into my shower wall. Zadro offered to send me a new Shower Bug. I guess they think I need eight 1"" circles on my wall. No thanks!"
3,Clock Battery Dead,My son opened this gift Christmas Eve and he got it all set up but the clock wouldn't work. Had to go out and spend over $6 to get a new battery to replace the one that came with it... If I would have known I would need a new battery I would have spent a little more money on his shower radio and clock and got a better one...
1,Waste of Money,Product didn't work at all. Returned the day after I purchased it. Don't bother buying it is a waste of money.
2,Annoying to use,"It's a cute little radio, nice and compact. The clock can keep time. That's where the usefullness ends. It is difficult to tune. The antenna got rusted. It was very inexpensive... but in this case, you get what you pay for. Don't bother."
1,One annoying thing,"I thought this would be just the perfect size for a radio in my bathroom. It is. However, the FM tuner on the radio automatically resets to 88.1FM EVERY time you turn it off. It won't retain your usual station, and start there when you turn it back on. And since there is a button to scan to the next available radio station (instead of an old fashioned tuner-dial), you might need to press it 10 times or more each morning to get to your preferred station. It's really quite annoying, and I end up listening to NPR for traffic instead of my favorite station, which is much farther down the dial. I would not have bought this product if I knew that ahead of time."
1,Nice looking piece of junk...,"I adore my showers and I've been looking for a way to put music and NPR in there with me. This looked like a great, inexpensive way to do that. Oh, so wrong was I. The thing is very ""cute"" -- looks like a little water skeeter with suction cups legs and an antenna tail. Looks great in the shower and clings well to the tile.But it doesn't work worth a damn. Finding a station is a chore of hitting the ""Scan"" button over and over again, which doesn't always work. There is no display so you can't tell what station you're on. And when you finally do find something, the reception is horrible. The sound is tinny but I expected that.The worst part? After spending all that agonizing effort to get station tuned in, as soon as you turn it off, it resets. Guh! It would have been so much better (and probably cheaper to make) if they had just made it with an analog dial rather than this fancy-but-doesn't-work digital tuner.Final recommendation: DO NOT BUY THIS! You have been warned."
1,Annoying Little Bug,"If your favorite radio station is at the beginning of the dial, this is a good buy. If not, forget it.I had no problems with reception, the time and date work fine, and the batteries last a long time. But if your favorite station is further down the dial or you like to listen to more than one station, save yourself the headache and buy something else. The station numbers are not displayed so you have to guess which station you're on and, as if that weren't annoying enough, when you turn it off it forgets which station you were on so when you take your next shower you have to start searching again from the beginning of the dial. If the Zadro had pre-sets, it would be great."
4,Shower Bug!!!,"The shower bug is a fun clock/radio for the shower. I got it for my brother who took showers for too long and essentially we ran out of hot water. The thing is easy to put in the shower. The suction cups work well. They have worn out a bit over time and I may have to push them back on more often, but the unit has never fallen.It is hard/a pain to find radio stations, but for the price you cannot expect a digital dial and functionality offered in other shower clock/radios. Good signal for the radio. Plus the thing is kind of cute!Great price for a simple product."
1,Will damage your tub surround - DO NOT USE,"My daughters received this radio for Christmas. It is a little short on features with regards to how annoying it is to tune. But, for little kids, they just like to play with it. In any case, all was fine until my wife went to remove it from the shower wall. It turns out that the rubber suction cups that come with the shower bug reacted (rather badly) with the wall of my tub surround. I now have four 1"" cicles melted into my shower wall. Zadro offered to send me a new Shower Bug. I guess they think I need eight 1"" circles on my wall. No thanks!"
1,dont buy it,"if i was able to rate this item with negative stars, i would have. once you turn the bug off, you have to find the station you listened to all over again. the reception is terrible. the suction cups dont suck to the wall. basically its a piece. dont waste your money!"
1,Will damage you tub surround - DO NOT USE,"My daughters received this radio for Christmas. It is a little short on features with regards to how annoying it is to tune. But, for little kids, they just like to play with it. In any case, all was fine until my wife went to remove it from the shower wall. It turns out that the rubber suction cups that come with the shower bug reacted (rather badly) with the wall of my tub surround. I now have four 1"" cicles melted into my shower wall. Zadro offered to send me a new Shower Bug. I guess they think I need eight 1"" circles on my wall. No thanks!"
1,A piece of crap,"I can't believe any company would build a piece of crap like this. It should be illegal lol. Tuning it is darn near impossible, you have to reset it and press the scan button repeatedly and it never reacts the same way twice. It doesn't even indicate the station it's tuned to so the only way to find a station is to tune another radio then sync them to the sound. Frustrating! - the hot water you waste in one month while fooling with this thing costs more than it's worth. Just turn up your clock radio real loud and leave the bathroom door opened ..."
1,BUG RADIO,Just needed some cheap music in the bathroom (and a clock). Opened - installed new batteries - doesn't work. Not worth paying to ship back.
1,You'll hate this,"It resets to 88.1 every time you turn it off. It's doesn't display the station. Very weak reception. So if you want to turn it on to 103.7, for example, you have to turn it on, then push the scan button about 16 times and hope you can identify the station by what's playing. If you pass it by, you have to press reset and start scanning all over again. Half the time, when you take your hand off the unit, it looses reception. I'm trashing it and getting a Sony."
1,Worst radio ever,"If only zero stars were an option.This might have a dgital display, but you can't find out what station you're tuned to.Reception is flaky at best, it resets every time you turn it off so you're back to searching for a station next time you shower. That's if it can even pick up the station you're looking for. Of course if it skips past it you'll have no idea becasue there's no frequency display.This radio isn't even worth 99 cents. Do yourself a favour and pick another one."
1,Annoying thing...,"I thought this would be just the perfect size for a radio in my bathroom. It is. However, the FM tuner on the radio automatically resets to 88.1 FM EVERY time you turn it off. It won't retain your usual station, and start there when you turn it back on. And since there is a button to scan to the next available radio station (instead of an old fashioned tuner-dial), you might need to press it 10 times or more each morning to get to your preferred station. It's really quite annoying, and I end up listening to NPR for traffic instead of my favorite station, which is much farther down the dial. I would not have bought this product if I knew that ahead of time."
1,Waste of Money,"I just bought this shower radio because I thought the price was good and all I needed it for was the clock and radio functions. Well what a mistake! I agree with the other reviewers that it is EXTREMELY ANNOYING to have to keep pressing the scan button in order to find the channel you usually listen to. What really upsets me is that you don't know if you have reached your usual channel since there isn't a dial for you to see what channel you're currently on. I have to listen to another radio in another room for me to know what is playing on my usual channel, and then run into the bathroom and try to find that channel on this radio before I jump in the shower. Whoever made this product is an idiot!"
1,"Found it packed away the other day, wish I didn't...","My wife bought this shower radio years ago. We hated it. It was packed away when we moved into our new home three or so years ago. I just found it last week. I just remembered that I hated it.This radio has horrible reception. I could get over that if you didn't have to push a button to go through the channels. It only sticks on channels it wants to (whether they are powerful enough or not) you can only go up through the dial and when you reach the end you have to press reset. When you do find a channel it will cut out for no reason in the middle of a song. Sometimes the channel comes back.On the plus sign it keeps good time. Clock still worked years later when I found it packed away the other day...I do NOT recommend this. Unless you are one that likes to use a computer without a monitor, rather with punch tape -- as that is what it is like going through the channels with those two buttons."
1,Ratings speak for themselves! (And louder than this radio...),"It's an awkward shape.It doesn't suction.The radio never worked. Not once.The clock is always out of sync, no matter how many times you set it; it's like a person with no rhythm.If you took one glance at this page and saw how many people gave it one star, and you're still contemplating buying this piece of junk, you are a fool.I didn't even need to write this review."
2,Eh...,"This product is a fun little toy, but it is difficult to find the station you want. The only way to change stations is by pressing scan, and it seems to reset everytime I turn it off. Even then it often misses my favorite stations. Even so, its fun design makes me smile."
2,Florence: Authentic Recipes,With more than 750 cookbooks I can equate thi one with no trtouble. The recipes are not outstanding. Not up to other Williams-Sonoma cookbooks.
1,Do not Purchase,"The description said it was compatible with Sony DSC-T9, and it definitely is not... i guess you get what you paid, which is nothing"
3,"A good idea, but not implemented quite right","2 and a half stars really.The bracket is easy to install, but my disappointment is the same as other reviewers have mentioned. Namely, no matter how securely the plastic block is attached to the wall - and they provide good size screws, the metal bracket wobbles and is not held securely onto the plastic mounting block. The metal bracket is solid enough. I got mine to hang a ladder in the garage. This is not a cheap or badly made product, but the design is slightly off trying to hold the metal bracket on the wall fixing with a flimsy plastic 'spring clip'. The spring clip is not really load bearing, but it stops the bracket coming off the plastic mounting block.)It probably will work because the metal bracket sits on a solid sloping surface, sort of like a coat hook. Any weight forces the metal bracket closer to the wall. But it is wobbly when not under load. Read the other reviews to complete the picture."
1,Disappointed and Derailed,"I have tried to install Loco-Mania only to find that the application is not unlocking using the provided product key. Although there is a download patch on the Loco-Mania WebSite for version 1.1, installing this did not resolve the issue.Looking at the forum section of the Loco-Mania web page, I find that others have had this problem with no resolution found. Although, it is understandable that software can have defects, I would expect at least an acknowledgement of the problem and that a fix exists or is on the way from the development company. To date I have seen neither.Serves me right for not reading the reviews before purchasing the product."
1,Be warned & beware...!!!,"I gave this game one star because that's the lowest score possible here. The reason is that it came with a non-functioning key code, so you can not even load the game. If you visit the Loco Mania web forum you'll see that problem is quite common for those who've purchased the game in North America. This is a known issue going back to last year--but there's been no reponse from either the distributors (Attari) or the developers (Wizard Works). Too bad as I did download the Demo version & it had some potential."
5,spiffy kettle !!,"Needed something quick & inexpensive for small office. WORKS FANTASTIC! Very fast, quicker than microwave. Kettle WILL NOT BOIL OVER if you follow instructions not to over fill. There needs to be room at the top of kettle to contain boiling water. We boil 1.7 litres (recommended capacity) all the time. Kettle will hold up to 2 litres, but that is not what it is designed for. Easy to clean, just wipe down."
5,Works like a charm,"I don't know why people say it takes the Express Kettle so long to heat up water-when I've used it-been using it for only a few days-daily-and it's heated up the water VERY quickly.I think the only way it would take a long time is if you had it filled to the max.But yeah.It heats water in about 2-5 minutes,which is fast(I'm used to a garden variety kettle,and it took-no lie-close to 10-15 minutes to heat water.)You can't get much better than this-and you can't beat the price-it certainly doesn't look like it should be in the $20 price range. I bought one after seeing one in action at my aunt's house.I drink lots of tea,so you know it gets a lot of use. :)"
2,Does not last much past warranty period,"I have had 4 of these now. I found it to boil water quite quickly. I also had the problem with one of them that the filter would fall out, but was able to pop it back in easily.The main issue is that only one has last beyond 2 years. Usage on the longer lasting one is probably 1-2 times per day, and on the ones that did not last, maybe a bit less."
5,JW,I was skeptical at first as I thought It could not boil water any faster than a teakettle. It can't but it is infinitely more convenient than a teakettle and I find I use it all the time.
2,Kettle with several design flaws,"Here are some design problems with this kettle:1: the buttons to open the lid are awkward to use, requiring a strange clawing motion.2: the ""on"" lamp is on the side away from you when you're using the kettle, so it's not visible.3: letting the lid fall down often doesn't close it completely, but even if it's just very slightly open the cut-off switch doesn't work and the water boils away till the pot is dry.4: being right at the bottom of the pot, the heater switch is easily turned on by accident if you bump something against the pot -- even a newspaper."
2,"Boils fast, but annoying to use","This Melitta kettle holds lots of water and boils very fast. However, it's inconvenient to use. The lid has to be pinched just right on each side in order to be lifted. The on/off switch is below the handle and must be firmly pressed - the slightest jiggle will click it off. The light indicator to let you know when it's on is located on the opposite side of the pot from the handle, so you must think when you place the pot on the pad. If you don't turn the light so you can see it, you won't know when it's cut off, because there is no ""Ding"" to let you know. Big sigh. I had a Phillips kettle which worked great, except for the little problem it had with the kettle separating from the cap covering its electrical parts. So I got the Melitta to replace it. Now, I'm hunting again."
1,boils water but won't stop,"Product worked of for a few months but then it stopped stopping, which defeats the main purpose. The screen over the spout falls in and without it properly in place the unit's sensor, that turns it off, does not work. This failure mode might be a safety issue.We previously had a Phillips that worked well. In fact I bought another to have one at work and one at home, but the new one, which was at home, succumbed to an electrical short, after water splashed into the bell holes near the switch. The next time I turned it on ... poof... and it worked no more. I did like the bell feature. The old Phillips, now at work, is still going strong. I am planning on ordering a Braun."
2,"Not so ""express""","I purchased this kettle for its speed in boiling water. I was very disappointed to find out that it was only about 2 minutes faster than a traditional tea kettle on the stove. This wasn't enough of a time savings for the extra expense, so I returned the kettle."
5,This kettle is excellent!,"I use this kettle at least 5 times a day to heat up water for tea. It always brings my water to a boil in less than 2 minutes. The on/off handle gives an audible click when the water is done (as well as the red light turns off), and it has never failed to automatically shut off. Of course, I'm usually nearby, so once the water is done I always take it off the electrical base. I do not store it plugged in, so I don't have to worry about it magically turning on by itself and burning over. The handle and the base of the kettle do not get hot, so you can set it on the table and not worry about it burning anything. The lid opens and shuts quite easily. You do have to pinch it to open it but it's not like it takes a lot of strength to do so. The on/off switch is very clear, just push it down and it's on. I really like it and it works great!"
1,Beware of electric base connection,"I bought this kettle over a year ago and used it daily, but am now having the following problem. The electrical connection on the base has got very loose, so the kettle won't turn on unless I wiggle the plug and pull it into just the right position every time I use it. Bit annoying really, not to mention the risk of getting a shock!"
3,"Some good, some bad... Not really worth your time.","One of the earliest books of Magic the Gathering fiction, this anthology helped flesh out the worlds of Dominia. The stories range from humor to horror and even a couple that read like fairy tales (The Brass Man Who Would Sink). The central characters are of all ilks, from evil to good, from goblins to angels, from brave to foolish. Seventeen stories make up quite a range and present a difficulty when trying to write a review for the entire book, but overall I'd have to say that I wasn't very impressed. Some of the stories are good (none of them fantastic) and some of the stories are bad. A couple really stand out as being short and pointless, probably thrown in to meet some kind of quota.I'd have a hard time recommending this collection to anyone who wasn't just obsessed with MTG fiction. Not really worth your time."
2,Beware of wrong size,"I received these pants, and they are very nice, except they are the wrong length. The label says 30 inch inseam, but they were more like 36 inches. No idea how such an error is possible."
2,Average,"Osdorp Posse used to be my favourite band, but with this single (+album) they really blew it. The cover song of this single is targetted at a big audience. Nothing wrong with that, but than don't claim you hate the radio and that you're true underground. This song has got nothing to do with ""old skool"" Osdorp like the albums ""afslag osdorp"" and ""stijlpikkers"". A real shame , another band gone to waste through commercial pressure. If you like osdorp posse buy all the other albums and singles, but avoid this one. If you like happy, commercial rap you can try this."
2,Balck and White?!,I didn't realize this DVD was in black and white. It doesn't say it any place on the case and was not mentioned in the description when I purchased it...I just figured all CARTOONS were going to be in color....silly me!!!
4,Great journalist view of history,"Just finishing it. I ate it up, reading 40+ pages a night, which is a lot for me. Great insider view into history of wars in India (WWII era), Algeria and Vietnam. Also, really good insights into how journalists *really* see the world they report on. Thoroughly enjoyable memoir of one who lived life on the front line."
3,Dry in parts,"I picked this book up hoping it would be an expose of journalism. Mr Behr does include a few snippets, but I got mired in a lot of political analysis, and couldn't finish the book. This is a great book if you like wars and want to understand what went on behind the scenes from a journalists' point of view. I'm just not the political type."
5,The Florida bobcat's guide to mice,"When you are next lucky enough to find yourself in sections of the Florida peninsula still green and grassy or blue and wavy, you'll have a sharper chance of spotting limpkins, roseate spoonbills, plovers, manatees and alligators and hundreds of species more, even mice, with this perky pink guidebook in your backpack. Florida Wildlife Viewing Guide takes you to the most popular and also the least-known local, state and national preserves where you can make like a Florida (wild) native."
4,First class rep of Cape Jazz,"Tony Schilder is a genius among geniuses among Cape Town's jazz musicians. It is a pity that Tony and the likes he surrounds himself with on this CD -- especially the great Robbie Jansen -- have not received world-wide stardom for their work. This CD, which also features Cape Town born Jonathan Butler, is a fitting representative sample of Cape Town jazz. The tracks are mostly established classics, especially the wonderful Montreal (named after a popular, now closed, club on the Cape Flats). Other highlights include Blues for BB king, Magic and Gimme Lovin'. Production value is, for South African standards, very good. Importantly, one senses the joy and passion the artists put into the album."
5,Ann likes Red--republished,this is a republished version of the original story from 1965. It looks JUST LIKE the old one and 5 year old daughter LOVES it as much as me and my sister! Thanks for bringing back such an oldie but goodie!
5,Ann Likes Red,This book was the first childhood memory when I was three and I would love to own it. I used to have my mom check it out of the library every time we went. I never owned a copy but would love to show my nieces who are little and any future children. It is a definite must be read to all little girls. Would be a dream for me to have it reprinted so that others who remember it and want to share it as I do can buy it.
5,The Heart of a Witch,"I love this book. It is well written and when I first started reading I could not put it down. Altough it is about Witchcraft, it is also fictual and should be treated as such. This kind of book will keep you in suspense from the beginning to the end. To bad it ended so sad. Maybe the author could write a sequal."
5,A FABULOUS BOOK,"This was the best book I've read in a long time. The characters are very well done and the plot moves right along. I can't wait to read the next one. Write faster, please."
5,"A must read for all who like witches, magic and mayhem.","If you like witches, you'll love this. A great page turner for every book reader. This book has got love, fear, magic and power. Anyone who reads will want to read this!!"
5,On Target Wiccan Fiction!!!,"As a Wiccan, I found this to be one of the most truly accurate portrayals of the Craft in a fiction novel. The characters were well-developed and the writing style poetic yet straightforward. One of the best books I have read in a long time. The ending was truly a surprise. A must read for everyone!"
3,"Good, but a bit slow","This was all in all, a pretty good book. It really gets into witchcraft and shows it a gentler, friendlier side, but there were some very slow points. And some irritating points as well. Shelley turned out to be a dissappointment. She was so selfish and later turned out to be a weaker character, and this whole being in love with your brother thing was out of wack. I guess I am not disappointed in the book itself, but the characters and some of thier lack of personality. I am glad I read the book, but I recommend if anyone read it, they be prepared to spend a lot of time doing so."
2,I would have loved this as a teenager...,"I couldn't get past my dislike of the Shelley character. I kept asking myself, ""If you're so skeptical and downright disbelieving, than what are you doing here?"" Of course, I suppose she just wanted to follow her brother, but still, after while I wanted to kick her in the butt and tell her to go home! I simply didn't like Shelley! To me, she was completely unsympathetic after awhile. I think I would have enjoyed this book a lot more when I was a teenager, when I was not a particularly critical reader."
4,Very Good!!!!,"'The Heart of a Witch' was an excellent, EXCELLENT book! I would have given it a five star, except for the fact that some of the rituals in the book are down right disgusting. Any normal person wouldn't do that. Other that it was great."
1,Xylitol is poisonous to dogs and should not ever be given to dogs.,"Please, do NOT give your dog a product which contains Xylitol. I gave one star because you have to rate it something."
2,Pathetic,"I used this book in my senior year in school. This book is no doubt the easiest Math book I have seen. If you don't want to take my word , try it yourself, you will be amazed how is the author uses same examples over and over again. Plus with all the nonsense examples and Questions this book is extremely expensive as compare to rest of the books in the market. I can confidently state that I have not learned a single new thing from this book. This book should be called ""introduction to Algebra using same examples over and over again."""
5,BEAUTIFULLY MADE,"The sandbags arrived promptly-- and v. well packaged. They are sturdy and beautiful. We put them to use for various things: ""yoga-type"" poses, such as the relaxation pose: putting legs up the wall, straightened, with body next to wall, having someone place the sandbag on the person's flexed feet. This is calming, (believe it or not!) -- for children, as well as adults. Be sure sandbag is not too heavy for kids, though. Am very happy with the product! It's also good for various body aches, and even for period cramps--re. having the person lie on floor with legs bent up underneath body, belly resting on thighs (""child's pose"") placing sandbag on their back. The pressure is soothing."
2,sandbags,"Unfortunately, they leak. I tried picking ones that said they had an inner lining to prevent this, but they still leak small amounts of sand whenever I use them"
1,Useless,"I bought these lights for the back of an under the stairs closet. They were not very bright, but it was better than nothing. The sticky tape was useless. Both lights fell down within a day or so. I lost track of one of them, but found the other one and put it back up with some better adhesive. The screws they provided would have worked as well, but then the light stopped working all together. I finally got around to changing the batteries and found that the cheap batteries it came with had exploded and rusted out. (the closet isn't damp). New fresh batteries didn't help. Maybe the miniature light bulb is broken as well. I'm not sure and I don't care! I'm going to try a different product from another company."
4,Good but sticky,This worked great but was messy. Use oil and a cloth to clean up any wax left behind... soap and water will not get this off!
2,Ouch!,"I've always used stripless wax- this was the first time I'd tried wax with strips. It did not work out for me. It ripped my skin off- not the affect I was going for. Unfortunately, it took my skin off but left the hair behind. So, by the time my face is healed up, I will have a full beard. Nice."
2,MESSY,"This is the worst wax I have ever used. I got it because I'd never tried it before, and I figured it might be worth looking into. It was SUPER messy, VERY sticky, not a product I care to purchase ever again."
2,Awful...,"I bought this at a local drug store and it's so crappy but I can't find anything better locally. I've gone through a LOT of waxes but it seems most of the microwaveable variety are really crappy. Not only is this one bad at removing hair, it's also REALLY MESSY. It sticks to everything yuck! Still looking for something better but this isn't it..."
5,Perfect,Came posted to Australia in very quickly and postage was NOT overpriced. Undamaged and exactly as described no parts missing perfect for what I need
5,Man-Sized indeed,"Polly Jean Harvey is one of the most original creative voices there is. Man Sized is a must have single for every rock music lover. As always , she delivers an excellent performance. And may it be duly noted her B-sides are just as worthy of collecting as her albums. from the To bring you my love type Daddy, to the bluesy rocker wang dang doodle this is one single you don't want to miss."
5,Good review of the major points to consider when interviewing,"I'm starting my interview process for jobs here soon out in the civilian world, and found this book to be invaluable in preparing my questions. The author also does a nice job leading you to other resources on the Web and in print. Even though he is a urologist, the tips and information are applicable to any specialty, even primary care.If you're graduating residency, or like me and transitioning to civilian practice, it's worth the scratch to pick this book up and read it a few times to let the information sink in. I would especially consider picking this book up before getting in contact with any 'headhunter' services, because it gives good tips on how to deal with those companies as well."
5,"Like Gilbert and Sullivan, Murder & Sullivan Scores Big!","Perhaps the best of the Joan Spenser mysteries, Murder and Sullivan is soooo much fun! The main character is this ordinary music-loving lady, Joan, and she's always up to her neck in danger! I love all of Sara Hoskinson Frommer's books. They're fabulous reads if you like mysteries. A writer friend of mine says she thinks Frommer is the best mystery writer out there today..and she might be right, too."
2,"""Canned"" Music of the Worse Kind","I don't know when I've been so uninspired listening to music that should be inspiring to listen to. It's ""canned"" elevator music of the worse kind. There is no emotion put into it, no depth of feeling. It just sounds like music being played using electronic or recorded synthesizers, very measured and mechanical sounding, with no variations of pitch or tempo. So non-dimensional is this music that I highly recommend finding Irish music elsewhere."
4,KILL TALK,Thought the story was great. Didn't guess the ending - unusual these days. Not the best writing style I've ever seen - but that's not what you are looking for from a novel like this. If you want to be entertained and you like crime genre buy this. You won't be disapointed.
5,Absolutely the best tissues ever!,"Once you use Puffs with lotion, it's hard to go back to regular tissues. My nose is never sore now!"
4,Quick Shift Walker is Great,I highly recommend this walker for a baby 10 months or more. My daughter just got up and started pushing across the room right away. It has really helped her with her desire to walk and her balance. She also loves the shape sorter on the back & the music on the steering wheel. We have tried it as a ride-on a couple of times but she not ready for that quite yet. We received it as a gift and it was a pleasant surprise.
3,"Good, but hard to start","Not a bad exercise tool, but hard to start spinning. I could not get it going at all without string (your supposed to be able to) and the string is a bit of a pain. Not sure its worth the hassle..."
3,"Easy to learn, hard to master...","The manual is VERY short but, despite other reviews, I found easy to start Dynaflex Gyro.Unfortunatelly, it is NOT that easy to learn the movements needed to keep it running. I'm still looking in the internet to learn.But I'm not disapointed with it, since I understand that is matter of time..."
3,great for strengthing arms and rehab,"DH wanted this to work out and rehab his arm. It's a great product. Does take some getting used to because you have to keep it moving to keep it working. I could never get it started, DH would have to start it for me and then hand it over."
2,"Difficult to start, Insufficient resistance","I have gotten this item to work as advertised only a handful of times. The rest of the time has been spent attempting to make it work as it is advertised to. I've tried their silly suggested methods for starting it by flicking with your hand. Goodluck. The string method, a small red string wrapped around the inner ball mechanism and pulled quickly to generate rotation, works on occasion, but is nowhere near reliable and will result in you fiddling with the thing trying to make it work moreso than benefiting from it. If this is intended to relieve carpal tunnel symptoms when used properly, it would only exacerbate said problems while trying to make this thing work as it should. The few times I was able to operate this device as intended, the resistance offered was minimal and was better suited to very light therapy than any kind of muscle-work or toning. The idea is great, a gyro offering resistance. Well, this one doesn't work."
4,get's the job done,"overall pretty happy with dynaflex. took a while to figure out how to get it going, but watching videos on youtube helped. overall it provided some relief when my RPI flared up in my wrists."
5,great,"This product is awesome. works great, shipping was great, everything is great. ;0 :) :) :)Thank you for the great product. i love it chavolito."
4,my wrist,"I found this product exceptionally helpful in bringing my movement in the wrist to better than 75%.After surgery and a metal plate placed in my wrist,my therapy sessions had ended , I found the dynaflex gyro kept me excercising at home longer and even better than my therapy sessions had. Within 3 weeks my wrist is back to as good as it will get.Thank You."
3,Bad luck.,"This product is a really good product however the one i got is very wobbly and the gyro inside is jacked up. Makes very loud noise as well, like its scraping. Everyone who owns one in the office agree's that I should probably get this one replaced or refunded. Hopefully the warranty is good. I recommend the product though as it is a good work out when you have a working one. Probably just luck of the draw I guess."
2,"Hard work, but VERY noisy",My husband ordered this exercise ball and I have tried it- it does work the muscles in your arm and hand pretty well. I couple of complaints that I have about it are that it is very hard to get it going- it comes with a string that you have to loop through the ball in between the blue plastic in order to spin it to get it going- it takes several time to get it right each time you use it and once you get it going it is incredibly noisy! You cannot quietly do this exercise when you are waiting in line or watching TV- it is way too noisy. Needless to say this exercise ball is now sitting in the bottom of a drawer somewhere in our house- I would probably guess that is where it will end up in your house as well!
1,what a joke,"This is the most absurd product i've ever seen and/or ordered. No instructions came with the product. Just this gadget and a string to insert and pull to make the dumb thing rotate while you hold it in your hand with the injured wrist. Then it only spins for about 10 seconds and stops and you have to continually reinsert the string and pull it again. I see Absolutely NO benefit from this product, and anyone who was duped, as I was, should be refunded in full.POOR, POOR, POOR ridiculous product....with no instructions included. I want my money back."
1,Garbage,"This is impossible to get started either with the string or running it on a flat surface. First off the string repeatedly slips out of the hole and even if you do manage to get it to work, it falls out almost immediately once you move this section to the opposite side. Okay, I thought, I'll try the running the ball on a flat surface approach. This time I could get the ball turning but I was unable to keep it going no matter how I held it. I asked my husband to try it and he had no more luck with it than I did. I'm sending it back."
2,Not quite right,"This was not quite the quality I expected. My friend has one, and it is a lot higher quality giro. He paid the same for his. Not real happy with mine for the money it cost. Be careful what you buy."
3,string starting can be a pain,"The string to start it proves ineffective over time, as the string loses its rigidity. It is very difficult to push start it (roll across table, spin with hands, etc.) without the string. It does work the forearms out good though. However, the gyro is kind of loud. After a year, I finally just beat it to death in frustration. lol"
3,can be better but you get what you pay,"this is the orginal dynaflex so if you are interested, get the more expenisve ones cause its better."
1,Not satisfied,Got this product to help with tennis elbow problems. Expected the exerciser to be more difficult to hold and increase forearm strength. I was wrong. Tried many times and I don't recommend this item unless you have difficulty lifting a can of soup.
2,Was not complete,"Had to send back, did not have all the parts. Unit was in good condition, except it was missing the starter cord"
4,hang on,"This is a great product the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, the string, I had to put a dowel on it with a hole in it to be able to pull the string good enough to get it going. Once I did this, hang on the ball is going a really gives you a work out. Great for people like myself who can not work out on weights because of a balance issue.Julie"
4,Works pretty well.,"The initial start up can be difficult. The guys who said it doesn't work and returned to the store, gave up too easily and don't know what you're missing. The trick is to get enough momentum on the initial spin. After that try changing the grip to work on various part of forearm. Interesting ""toy""."
1,A piece of junk,"This sounded like a good idea, but the implementation completely negates any actual usefulness. It was designed and built by those who have no real knowledge of gyroscopes and how to built one. As constructed, the only exercise will be trying to get it function well enough to out perform a one pound dumbbell which is one tenth the cost. I purchased a child's toy gyroscope several years ago that still generates much higher gyroscopic forces with far greater ease of operation that this thing.I gave it one star because that is the minimum allowed."
1,YOUR JOKING,This is one of those products that you see on TV at 3:00am when you can't sleep or find a show leaving you to channel surf. I have a type of spinal injury that has now effected my grip & wrist's so I thought why not..... BETTER NOT!
4,sweet dude,"ok,my frend Megan has this and i tryed it and...THIS IS SOO COOL!!!its grate for rock climbing and its a grate traing tool!i did not get it at first but it was allsomeIT GOES ALL LIKE BUZZZ AND VERRRR**it was sweeeeet dude"
4,dyna-flex gyroscope exercise ball,"It's pretty good. I've seen some that have lights, and they're way more fun to play with and share. This one doesn't entertain at parties as well."
4,Good product,"I feel it's a good and well made product. The problem is when ""working out"" becomes fun you will tend to over do it. I have blisters on the insides of my fingers - so watch out for that."
2,Doesn't last forever..,"It works okay. It's basically a gyroscope in the form of a ball. When you first use it, the spinning in the ball feels very fluid. However, after regular use, it feels and sounds like there's wear on the inside. It used to be easy to get the spinning started, but now it is more difficult, perhaps because of the wear. Wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Piece of junk,Difficult to use and the string easily becomes trapped inside the ball. Just try getting it out!Instructional CD did not play on my CD player or my DVD player.Waste of money. Buy something else.
1,Nah.,"Not impressive. The torque isn't very strong, and the spinning doesn't last long enough. Back in the early 1970's, there was a toy top called the Whizzer which was nearly more effective than the Powerball. For one thing, it was easy to spin, by rolling it on a tile or concrete floor. Plus it did have torque. The Powerball requires a string to be wrapped around it and pulled, and in my opinion, you get more exercise pulling the string than using the Powerball! Anyway, my advice is to save your money."
1,First Dead; The second broke very soon,"First one I got would not start (no matter what I tried).Next one worked well for the first 20 or so uses. Now it will not keep going no matter what (it never ""planes up"" like it use to). Stay away from this piece of junk."
2,Did they not consider that these things might get dropped?,"I bought one and used it for several days. It was fun and I guess it probably would have led to strengthened arm and hand muscles, if it hadn't broken from a fall of 2 ft onto a carpeted floor. I was really amazed that it broke so easily."
4,"Fun and useful, a bit loud","This toy is fun to use during idle time even if just for a few minutes, and is a pretty low impact excersize (and yes, it does excersize your hand and arm). Using it requires practice, you must get it going fast and turn it at sufficient rate to keep it going, but once you discover how it feels once it's going you'll be able to do it again.It's possible to use while driving, though requires some careful attention and a place to quickly put it, like a cupholder, if you need both hands (otherwise it will spin all around the car).The main downsides are that it makes noise while spinning, which might annoy your family and makes it unusable in many office/work environments, and it can be uncomfortable to hold with mainly your thumb and forefinger (Once it gets going I usually reposition it so I am using all of my fingers and palm to hold it from the bottom-- a slightly different grip around the edge would have helped with this)."
1,Breaks Easily,"Maybe I just got a bad one but after two days of normal use it broke. No longer will the device maintain a spin. You can spin it up, but no amount of effort will keep it going.To add insult to injury this was intended as a father's day gift to my father. I paid for expedited shipping from Exercize Goods (3 day shipping). It took nearly two weeks to arrive well after the already inflated delivery estimation. I guess it is just as well though. I'd rather be stuck with a lemon than give a gift that breaks in two days."
3,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I used this for a while, going through all the frustrations of getting it started. Hand swipes, string, etc. The string frequently gets stuck in the sides and eventually gets ruined. Pieces get stuck in the gyro, making it even noisier. The thing fell off my desk and it turns out that the construction isn't all that good either.It seemed to help a bit with forearm strength, but not a great deal. I think it's over hyped by the maker. Get a grip exerciser instead and a light wait for lifting and I think one can get the same effect and more versatility. At least those don't require several minutes of startup time or an expensive gadget just to get them going."
3,Just buy a forearm weight,"The idea is cool and it is kinda fun to use it, but it doesn't work your arms/wrist as much as you expect. Plus you look stupid doing it at your desk at work, so I never use it. I would just get some forearm weights and use them at home."
4,Decent Little Wrist Gyro,"The Dynaflex Gyro comes with the gryo and a string to help you start it off. Right off the bat one side of the string broke (plastic part on the tip snapped off), but that wasn't really a big deal because there's two ends to a string.It certainly does it's job, and is quite a workout for my previously broken wrist. It's easy enough to watch some tv and spin this thing."
4,Love it!,Not sure if this is really building my wrists and forearms much but I love it. It's like a pacifier. Whenever I'm tense I pull it out of the drawer and play for 5 minutes or so. Great therapy. I can't imagine how anyone is strong or coordinated enough to start it without the string. I certainly am not.
4,Very effective,Very effectiveA bit tough to hold when you get really fatigued. I'd like to see a version in which the whole thing has a non-slip covering rather than the current narrow band.Definitely recommended.
3,Wrist Exerciser,"The powerball works great. My only issue with it is that it sometimes squeals quite loudly, which is why I returned the first one. The one that I got to replace it squeals at times too but not quite as much. The other powerballs I've use in the passed didn't squeal, so I assumed that it wasn't normal. Maybe it is for this one, I don't know."
3,dynaflex pro,It works fine. The only bad part would be to say that its not very sturdy. I feel like it will break within the next month or so.
4,Amusing product,"I use it whenever I can, though I have noticed that it is kind of wearing out. I don't think it will last more than 6 months, and I'll need to buy another one."
2,No Spin,Works the wrist and forearms as stated. But to start the device spinning is a problem.Finally bought the docking station and works as advertised.
2,Needs work,"Like so many others, I am having a hard time starting the ball. After about 3 days, my average success is one out of fifteen tries. Unless some better starting method is created, I don't see this being a very viable product.Once it does get going, it is good."
2,If I could get it started...,"After watching the instructional cd, I still couldn't get it started. I have tried multiple times, and just when I get it going, I start using the movements it says to, and then it stops. I was going to return it, but since it would cost about half of what i paid to send it back I figured I'd just keep it and try and sell it to someone else"
1,Pathetic junk -RIPOFF!,"I bought this SO-CALLED therapeutic powerful exercise device in Connecticut, away from home on a trip and was completely fooled by the FALSE ADVERTISING and the fact that what APPEARED TO BE a reputable large sports store (I forget the *&*%!#'g name of the store) was selling WHAT I THOUGHT WAS a hi-quality product. A bit gimmicky maybe, but if it worked it would be great: DOES NOT WORK, other reviewers are KIDDING THEMSELVES by giving it more than one star! A TOTAL RIP-OFF! PATHETIC PIECE OF JUNK!"
1,"100 % Garbage, A Waste",I simply got sold by the advertising. I have trouble figuring out how I got suckered but I did. I will keep this in my desk to remind myself of this. This thing does nothing athletic and is worthless to any person of any age.
1,Poor Title,"This book is titled taming and training lovebirds, yet only 6 of the 92 pages are dedicated to this topic! If I wanted a book on basic care, basic information or anything other than taming and training this may have been an informative book but since I have already read 15 other books (not exagerating) on those topics, this book was useless! Regardless of reading level this book does not provide what it promises and I highly do not recommend this book."
2,Not a fan.,"Not sure what I was expecting quality-wise for a sterling silver ring, but this felt cheap and plasticky in my hands, like something I could have purchased at the dollar store. That said, I couldn't believe I paid over $20 for it. Definitely returned it and am waiting for it to arrive back in LA so I can get my refund. Head to Etsy for better quality, real Irish rings."
4,Vintage OSC,"This is a very good Alvin book. It seems a little watered down, but plenty happens in these pages. Alvin is journeying with his friends, but not with his wife. Peggy is doing her own business in the Crown Colonies to the south. She runs into trouble. So does Alvin, who goes to New England and is accused of being a witch.Card does Alvin well. I just wish he'd continue the series, as this book left me wanting to know what happens next. I take that as a Good Thing."
2,"Bad, Bad Cover Art","I would have given this book an additional star if it wasn't for the terrible art on the cover. I was embarrassed to read this novel in public. The marketing for this series really cheapens the writing. My friends laugh at me when I show them these books, then insist they are good. I would never buy such an ugly book in hardcover. Get with the times, TOR."
1,Can It Possibly Get Worse?,"After slogging through the fourth book, I was wary of reading HEARTFIRE, the fifth book in the Alvin Maker series - but I bought the book and I was determined to finish it. If you consider reading this book, the Harlequin Romance-esque cover should be your first tip-off.This book starts with newlyweds Alvin and Peggy separated with no real explanation given, Peggy has gone south to try and stop the coming war caused by slavery, and Alvin finds himself on trial - AGAIN. Basically an anti-slavery rant, the characters talk incessantly and nothing happens. Too boring for words.There is another book after this one, can this series possibly get any worse?"
3,OSC didn't take us too far,"Having looked forward to this installment of the Alvin series for a long time, I was quite disappointed when reading the short and seemingly pointless result. New characters are introduced, the plot gets a little creamier, but after a couple hundred pages of waiting to see what the next step is, we're greatly disappointed to find...the end of the book.This was a surprising release for OSC, especially in this series. It seemed stagnant...or more like a dog chasing its tail. I won't lose faith in the rest of this series because the first three books were so rewarding, but I'll be cautious when reading ""Crystal City."""
2,Acceleration is NOT the word for this product,"There's a point in almost any given fantasy series where it all grinds to a halt. The child prodigy grows up, characters accumulate, and the dialogue becomes about as interesting as oatmeal..that you ate yesterday. Orson Scott Card made his transition from an intriguing and thoughtful concept to Star-Trek movie camp in HEARTFIRE. But even while he resorts to tried and tired tricks--marriage, more characters--he manages to keep up the interest other his loyal readers."
4,"Almost sermonizing, struggles to contain the plot.","Seems like we (and Alvin) think that Alvin is headed round the bend - he's so busy trying to be 'good' and keep sane, he's heading nowhere. We keep losing the thread of why he's wandering and have to be reminded occasionally of his aim. OK there were some nice touches in there, Audobon & Balzac especially, but I thought the trial was a bit too glib - I reckon that the pro-slavery contingent would have just taken over and had a hanging there & then in real life. But, if Alvin really is the second coming - I guess that makes it all OK. Enough of picky - the book is a good, flowing read, as most of the Alvin series are - Card is a master story-teller, dragging you into the soul of his characters, willing you to keep reading...."
2,Cheerleading,Not what I expected.. this was brought so me daughter could learn to the basics of cheering and she did not like it.... It came quickly though....
2,Cheer Routines,"I was expecting more routines, but this VHS was so old, it didn't offer much. Don't bother."
2,Sucks,These lights are crap. They do not line up with the body and are overall ugly. First wash and I had water in them
1,Not so good,"I read it and I didn't care for it. The story was predictable. I thought it was bland and unoriginal. The characters were okay, not much depth. The author needs to learn a bit more about plot development. The author doesn't like women much, that's clear. It reminded me of one of those awful romance novels with the cover picture and the lame character names. The story itself started out okay but if action is a bj on the first page? big deal."
5,A tour de force mystery,"On the advice of a friend I picked up this book. I literally couldn't put it down once I started reading. Author Pezzullo has created a very vivid, and sympathetic hero in Smokey Annicelli - the wounded ex-cop who searches for the missing Eve.I can't remember another book I've read recently with a more fascinating lineup of supporting characters, from the warm, sophisticated fashion design Danielle Giroux, to Smokey's mentor Sabino Goldstick, to Sunny - the sexy beach girl Smokey meets in Miami. And there are more. Pezzullo brings all of them to life with tremendous skill.The book is excellently plotted with many unanticipated twists and turns. You don't know where author Pezzullo is going to take you next. But it sure is an exhilarating ride. I'm looking forward to more from this author. In the meantime, I urge you to read this book."
3,The exact same book as the rest of the series,"I think I am pretty much done with this series and probably the author. I've got the rhythm of it down, and now there are no surprises. The main character gets pushed around all through the book, and at the end his boss shows up and fixes things. I understand that his position doesn't allow him to act, but that does not seem like good storytelling - why doesn't he DO ANYTHING?!? Thinking and analysis are all very nice as long as they have a point. Instead the character dithers while others around him make the actions. I thought that with a title like ""Destroyer"" he would get to destroy something - no chance.Think ""Passive Hamlet in the Byzantine Court"" and you will get the picture."
4,A great next step in the series!,"I enjoyed this book, but then, I have loved all the books in this series!However, if you are new to the series and haven't read the 6 books that came before this one, you will not understand the dynamics or the personalities in this book well enough to get the full picture.C.J. Cherryh did tend to spend alot of time going over Bren Cameron's thought processes on Atevi politics, maybe a bit too much time! I sort of skipped through some of those sections because they really didn't seem to impact the story at all - at least for me - and I wanted to get on with the 'real' story and out of Bren's brain!Even so, my only thought after finishing....how long do I have to wait for the next book???!!! I hope not long!"
4,Works!,"Such a help to clean up those cords. Only issue is the directions are for a different hook, so it took a little longer than it needed to be attached and put up. Other than that I am happy with it!"
3,Idiosyncratic,"I received this book as a gift, otherwise I never would have stumbled upon it. I found it brief, highly idiosyncratic, and bordering at times on the realm of what might be termed fun. I disagreed with practically all of it, but found it stimulating in a way that the more ordinary works ordinarily are not."
2,Helpful for undergraduates,"O'Toole's historically-based concept of tragedy is a valuable corrective to the artistotelian viewpoint. He sees Renaissance tragedy as reflecting the problematic transition from medieval to early modern in England. His argument is not especially original but still very helpful for undergrads. O'Toole historicizes tragedy, presenting an accessible methodology for undergrads, taking them beyond purely formalistic analysis."
2,2020 review,Book was printed in 1995 and is very outdated and is past due for an update. I bought this book because it was required for a class. Even my professor thinks it is way outdated.If you're not required to purchase this book I would say you could make better use of your money.
1,Fell apart in ten days.,"About ten days after the rope arrived I was working out at 70 lbs and the right rubber head came off. When I attempted to re-attach by re-tightening the Phillips screw, the hole (in the rope itself) seemed stripped. A thin screw with narrow threads seems an inadequate attachment for what really is an easily compromised opening in a piece of rope--for once loosened, the attachment cannot be made secure again. Clearly a defective unit but still should not have happened."
2,Tricep Rope OK.,"Hard to comment on rope, so here's the message.1. This smells like processed plastic/ rubber. I used an odor neutralizer.2. The attachment point looks to be cast metal. Cheap stuff!3. One strand has already unraveled.This has been reviewed after one week of use. I recommend the Body Solid unit if your workoutsare heavy and frequent."
5,excellent,For the price this item is very good. I've been using mine every other day since I've gotten it and there have been no problems at all.
5,"Solid construction, lasted nearly a year so far.","This thing helps build monster triceps. It sturdy, and does what it should. I can put up the weight, and adjust how I bring it down to determine how I want to work my triceps."
5,Sturdy and flexible rope,The rope is perfect! Already flexible making it easy on the wrists. The rubber ends are thick and attached very well.
5,really good,this is exactly what it says it is. i loved it for the workouts i do and well built really good over all.
1,Boring,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning anything new about Yoko Ono and her marriage to John Lennon. While it did explore some of Yoko's early years, there wasn't very much detail about her life since the death of Lennon."
1,Horrible,"I bought this book at Powell's in Portland, Oregon, after hearing about it for several years. What a disappointment. Not only is it horribly written, but it includes sections by several different writers, most of which repeat the same ignorant and negative prejudices spewed against Yoko for years. If you are looking for a well written, objective, intelligent, indepth biography of this intriquing woman, you will not find it here. Sad...Save your money."
1,Too Complicated,This book is too difficult to understand. The book says it is a resource for nurses but it talks about how to insert a central catheter and calculating fluid/electrolyte/glucose rquirements which I will not use. It is full of complex formulas and charts that take up entire pages. It is also full of hundreds of statistics that are boring and a waste of my time to read. I was looking for something that starts out more basic and is easier to read. This book is more geared towards physicians or experienced nurses but not new grads starting out in the NICU like myself. Someone reading this book will need an introduction to basic neonatology before they can understand this book.
2,poorly written,"This was the book we used for my NICU level 3 training, has some good information but the index makes it very difficult to find what you are looking for. This book is not something that I am able to use on a regular basis and I feel like most of the time it doesnt fully answer the questions I have. I often defer to other resources at work."
5,Neonatal ICU facts and standard of care,There is nothing like this. Don't waste time looking for anything else. Keep it in the computer bag. It will never collect dust on a shelf.
2,Not a great DVD if you use soft wax,"The spa I work at only uses soft wax. This video says it teaches you using hard and soft wax, but that's not the case. She only applies soft wax on the bikini line. The only real thing I learned from this video is her draping technique."
1,Useless disc!,This is a most useless disc throwing together 5 tracks from the excellent 1983 revival cast of ON YOUR TOES and 5 from the 1980 London revival of PAL JOEY. Both scores are available complete... so why would anyone want this mishmash? Notice that the most famous piece from TOES (Slaughter on 10th Avenue) is missing. Don't waste your time or money with this disc!
1,Not whats pictured,I ordered this item and when I opened the box I was very unhappy. They are not the pictured item! Instead they are that ugly chrome. Don't be fooled.
4,Tail Light Assembly from Amazon,"They did exactly as advertised. Price was great, especially compared to replacement lens. Looks good on truck. The only negative is that the light assembly does not seal around the truck fender as tight as I would like or as tight as the OEM I replaced. I may have to add a silicone product to snug it up."
4,Pretty good. I got an agent using a moologue from this,"It's got a pretty diverse number of monologues for different types. I wish there was a little more ""direction"" given with each monogloue, but I supposed some wouldn't want to be restricted too much. The comedic monologues are ok, about on par with what you find in most books. So it's not laugh out loud hilarious no matter how you play it, but that can be good too, you don't want the writer overshadowing you too much if you're using this for an audition. So for now, it got me an agent and that's good. I asking a friend to write a more tailored monologue for me as this didn't have anything just ""perfect"" for me."
4,Actually quite happy,"I'm pretty picky with my monologues, and finding a comedic monologue is nearly impossible for me. The only thing that keeps me from rating this book 5 stars is that there aren't as many family-friendly monologues as I was hoping. I have an audition that requires something family-friendly, and though there are a couple things in here I might be able to use, I don't have many options to choose from.But this book is definitely worth buying. There are so many great monologues, and for the majority of your auditions, nearly all of them are appropriate...and funny!"
4,What I needed,"Was looking for more comedy audition materials and this satisfied my needs. Have not seen other volumes, but this one satisfied my need for age-appropriate materials."
5,Extremely funny,I love this book I needed it for a class and I still read it I say if you wanna laugh this book's for you
5,A Personal Favorite Scent,"I am usually not a huge cologne guy, but this is such an amazing scent I could not pass it up. The scent is strong, yet masculine enough for us guys. The top assures that leaking and damages to the spray nozzle will not occur often. The overall design of the bottle is nice as well. It is thick glass with a plastic top and nozzle. The top part of the glass is greenish, while the bottom remains blue.I know all you really care about is the smell though. Since they discontinued making this cologne, you are sure to have a scent that no one else has. An appealing scent that is unique is the point to cologne in the first place. I suggest using only one or two sprays per use. There is no reason to try to make this over-powering. If you like good scents, try to find this one."
3,An average Aird mystery...,"C.D Sloan and the comically brash and dense Crosby are back again. This time, they investigate the suspictious death of Bill Fent, who was administered a fatal dose of barbitutes, but got killed in a car accident first. Sloan and Crosby attempt to unravel who would want to kill the judge, as his closest relatives had reason not to, as well as how Fent was poisoned. Another murder brings Sloan closer to the truth as the motive for murder is discovered."
3,Otoscope pictured is not the one you recieve,"They have a picture of an otoscope in the main picture that is not correct and is what I thought I was purchasing. Otoscope model recieved is actually the one in the individual picture. Model 11253. I will keep it because I don't have the time to argue the point, hopefully the pictures are corrected for future buyers!"
2,Bleh!,i bought a set of gr/2s 4 years ago they were awesome. I have no idea what Kyb was thinking saying these are the replacement for the gr2s. these things are crap no where close to how they rode.these are floaty defiantly not good for a mustang. and 4 years ago the gr2s were about 100 a piece for the fronts almost price like tokicos. I should of known better and just returned them and bought some tokico's. stay away from kyb excel-g in my opinion .Pay more get better results.
3,Not Quite What I Was Looking For.,"If you are just looking to speculate in the market, this might be the book for you. It was well organized not too hard a read. But, I would recommend you start withChapter 11 Business Reorganizations: For Business Leaders, Accountants And Lawyersfor Chapter 11's. Of course the next step is to read the code:Mini Code (United States Bankruptcy Code)"
5,Up and coming,"While spending a few weeks in Belgium for work in the fall of 2000, I heard their single on the radio and bought the CD to take back with me to the US. Absolutely amazing! Krezip is filled with talent and potential, especially when considering their age. From jagged-edge guitar on ""Let it Go"" to the smooth lyrical piano singles like ""Won't Cry"", the band's emotion shows through on every note, with the unique touch of a Dutch accent. It is good to see this available finally in the US."
2,like 'em better live,"i saw them live at the summerfestival of werchter (2000) in belgium and they were good, but the studio album is a dissapointment."
5,One of the best CD's ever,"I've known this band for a long time, since the members and I have some common friends. I've seen them grow (musically), and the album is one of best I've got on my shelf. Jac (singer/songwriter of krezip) herself is a big fan of K's Choice and Skunk Anansie, which you can hear; but they do have their own - awesome - style. So just buy this CD. Btw, I'm not 1, but 18, but I hate giving out personal information, espacially spammers."
5,krezip RULEZZZ,As long as I know krezip I've never heard a boring song of them. Nothing less is a masterpiece you should have on your CDshelf
2,a weak band and cd,"hello, nothing less-of KREZIP is a very weak cd. song number 4 is the best song thare{on the cd} and the rest are just thare . they are very low music , mmmm i can say also an ametur band .i am sorry that i bought this cd."
4,The Book Of Common Prayer,The book is a very convenient travel size and bound in Leather for less then $20.00. This book does cost more in a brick and mortar book store.Shipping and packaging is excellent!
4,Exposes the misogyny that lies below the surface,"This is the second Tepper novel I read; I found it to be much more readable than the first, which was a fantasy novel. This is ostensibly science fiction, although it has elements of fantasy, such as the deity that offers Carolyn a reproductive choice that will decide the fate of humanity.The female characters are eminently believable, and its examination of our stereotypes of women, especially mothers, is fascinating. Some of the male characters are a bit two-dimensional. The story slows down a little in the second half - it becomes a little less dramatic - and the ending, where we are left hanging, is frustrating - we never learn what Carolyn decides. All in all this is a good read."
2,Gave up on page 135,"Features male characters and institutions so one-dimensionally evil and trite that they continually get in the way of the mediocre narrative. Honestly, I have my own suspicions about governments, Catholicism, Islam, and old-boy-networks, but Tepper exploits these so incompetently that the result is unbelievably tedious, and unbelievable, too."
3,Not Tepper's Best,"I enjoyed reading Sheri S. Tepper's ""Grass"" and ""Raising the Stones,"" but this one isn't so great. The main antagonist organization is a little over the top. One person like this I can buy, but a whole political party? The book is somewhat depressing as well, and doesn't say much about the future besides ""evil, bad, doom."" However, I CAN read this book without getting incredibly bored or compulsively throwing it across the room, which is more than I can say about much fiction out there today. I heartily reccomend the aforementioned Tepper books, but I'd avoid this one."
1,A big dissapoinment,"I was so dissapointed by this book. I had heard so many good things about Sherri Tepper, but this makes me wonder why she is so highly rated.The politics are unsubtle, the characters unengaging, the plot devices either poorly-thought out or frankly ridiculous, and the writing is at best patchy and reminiscent of the worst of Danielle Steele and the like. There are some brilliant feminist sci-fi and fantasy writers out there (Ursula Le Guin, Pat Cadigan, Marion Zimmer Bradley), but, at least on the basis of this book, Sherri Tepper is not one of them. And I had so wanted to like this book..."
2,even I find it hard to believe,"Even with the events in Afganistan these past few years, I find the basic permise of this particular Tepper novel hard to buy. I don't think women are so stupid nor so weak as to let their lives be controled. Nor do I think that it requires aliens to show us the way, let alone when the author herself doesn't conclude the tale! I was greatly disappointed."
3,Dissapointing!,"As a Tepper fan I was really dissapointed in this latest offering. It strives to explore globally important issues, but is ultimately hampered by a messy plot and some unbelievably bad characters. Tepper seems to have forsaken good characterisation and plotting for the sake of pushing her moral message. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the end of the book, I did not really care anymore what it was."
3,Good but not one of her best works,"I have read many of Sheri S. Tepper's books and I liked most of them, especially ""The Gate to Women's Country."" ""Gibbon's Decline and Fall"" kept me reading it and had some very strong points to make. Its characters were interesting and the plot, as I said, keeps you reading. What is missing from this book is hard to pinpoint. It is science fiction, and therefore not necessarily close to real life, so comments such as ""It's not like the way it really will be in the year 2000"" are invalid. What is really missing from this book is the sense of subtlety that was present in Tepper's ""The Gate To Women's Country."" The point of this books was thrown in your face. It is a good guess that not all of even Tepper's most loyal fans will appreciate this book, though I found it delightfully argumentative."
1,Partial quote warning,"Note the heavy use of ellipses in the reproduction of the New York Times review. And even so, it hardly seems like a raving review, does it? Before buying this book (or even investing your time in reading it), I highly recommend that you go back and read the full text of the Times review. In light of Tepper's past literary accomplishments, the review of this book was particularly harsh, which could be distilled into a few words: poorly-crafted, badly-plotted, overbearing polemical tract"
4,"Flawed, but interesting","I've been a Tepper fan for a long time; this is NOT Tepper's best work (that honor has to go to *Grass* and *The Family Tree*), but it's miles ahead of most popular SF.Some may complain that Tepper's characters here are stereotyped caricatures, but has anyone checked out the Taliban lately? Atrocities like the ones she describes take place daily on this planet. Her only stretch is imagining the same sort of rabid fundamentalism taking over the US.The moral dilemmas she presents are delicious. Which vial would YOU pour in Sophie's Cup? That tells me more about one's character and beliefs than any number of astrological charts.I also want to volunteer for the Baba Yaga League..."
4,True Dungeons and Dragons style action adventure.,"Tim Waggoner writes an easy to follow engaging an enjoyable adventure. Non stop action and fun to read. If you like swords and sorcery novels with a touch of humor you will like this. I would also recommend Waggoner's series of Zombie Detective books. I am looking forward to further books in ""The Blade of the Flame"" series."
5,great study and devotion Bible,"The copy arrived last week, with the New Testament page 95-96 corrected. 30 years ago, I was looking for this Bible and did not find it. At the time, Nelson was making one close to this, with center column references, concordance and maps, leather bound, selling for $36 dollars (1974 US dollar value). At the time it was the best I could find. Why Cambridge waited until 2000 to make this edition is puzzling to me.This Cambridge RSV is the top of the class in quality, construction , useful cross references and concordance. It is better then what I could find in the 1970s from anyone publishing RSV Bibles. Anyone looking for an RSV Bible for devotion or study should find this the Bible to use.As for the RSV as a translation, it has the best uniform style between OT and NT of contempory translations. It is the standard of 20th century Bible translations.It is a welcome partner in my ministry."
3,Obscure Haitian novel..,"Alexis's ""General Sun, my Brother"" tells an important tale of the 1937 massacre that is called the Dominican Vespers. What happened was that thousands of Haitians were killed by Dominicans who were resentful of them. Hilarion, the protagonist, witnesses this near the end of the book. Before that, we see surrealistic nonsense, and characters that are just there. Alexis may be realistic, but his characterization is not good. This book is entirely plot-driven, and we really don;t give a fig about Hilarion and Claire-Heureuse, who are poor Haitians caught in this maelstrom."
5,Hilarious!,"I bought this as a gift for someone that collects stuffed monkey toys and likes wine. They loved it. It is an outrageously goofy addition to any cocktail party setting, and always inspires comments and questions. You know you are in good company when they can laugh with you at this crazy looking wine holder."
4,What Are The Odds: The Chances of Extraordinary Events,"This is one of the funniest and most informative books I've ever read about one of the most mundane and potentially boring topics ever. Jefferson Hane Weaver takes a ""boring as watching paint dry"" subject and makes it entertaining, informative and (believe it or not) a page-turner. Basically, I learned a littel bit about ""Odds"" and laughed my ass off in the process.Well Done Mr. Weaver."
2,Needed a Numerate Editor,"I don't like to have to inspect table and graphs of quantitative information for correctness and plausibility. Because I found that this book contained several simple errors of calculation, I found it hard to trust ANY of the ""facts"" reported.Furtheremore, the author acknowledged no editor. Perhaps Prometheus Books did not provide one. Be skeptical of the quality of books published by Prometheus Books.Clifford Pickor (author), Leon Lederman (Nobelist), and Barry Parker (author) provided blurbs for this inferior book. Unfortunately, this book does nothing to counter the belief that the law is a refuge for the clever innumerate. (J. J. Waeaver, the author, is an attorney."
5,A film that makes you appreciate the art of fashion,This is an informative film about the fashion world and one of its finest creative people. I learned to appreciate and value the world of craftsmanship and artistry in the making of clothes and have come to realize how few of these people seem to be left. There's a concern about quality and artistry rather than just mass production and money. Worth the watch.
3,Its nice to watch,The documentary has a very nice story and anyone is a fan of Valentino should watch this. The reson i rated this 3/5 is that is not well executed.
5,Inspiring,"This DVD really did a great job showing the artistic side of Valentino. He is a true master of art in fashion. Any body that is inspired by fashion or just understand fashion and design, you will appreciate this DVD. He just wants to make women look beautiful."
5,it really helps,"Well structured and very clear concepts, It help me to have a deep understanding of how to develop a value stream mapping. I really recommend it."
5,Great Tool for the Lean Enterprise,"This book is right on target for the emerging practice of Lean accounting. It gets into the brass tacks of what you really need to do to report results that really mean something to the folks that can take action to improve the business. The entire concept of Value Stream Costing makes so much sense it's a wonder we haven't been using it for decades.We have asked manufacturing to change, change, change in order to improve results and compete in this global market yet we have ignored the need to provide the necessary support from the accounting area. This book shows, step by step, how accounting must partner with manufacturing as well as engineering to provide actionable information in a timely manner. The old conventions of standard costing and variance analysis lead to poor decisions and this book will explain why.A must read if you are serious about Lean manufacturing!"
2,Hard to Heat,WHile this product worked ok on my upper lip and chin. . No where in its description did it talk about HOW to heat.. it comes in a tiny little pot that is NOT microwaveable .. thus for me it was a stove ..We use a Gas store and even the smallest burner was too large for it.. thus heating the handle. .and then it was either drag the mirror to the kitchen (not a lot of light) or risk spilling the pot on the way to the bathroom with the brighter light.Wayy too much effort and risk for me
3,Not as good as expected,brought it for wife to wax legs. it seems the wax getting a bit more sticky and glued to skin causing pain while pulling out..The wax pan was a bonus though...
2,Too much work,"It showed up in a cute little pan that you put on your stove, but it ended up being too messy and too much work for me. Very sticky. I could just not be experienced with doing my own waxing...."
2,Stays too gummy to remove,"Yes, it does remove some of the hair, but it is next to impossible to remove the wax. The wax simply does not set right after it's applied. I have used other parissa kits without having this problem. I have tried everything. Additionally it is extremely difficult to clean up even with the azulene oil. The wax just stays too gummy to be able to zip it off and get good removal. i won't buy this again."
2,not for sensitive skin,This product is easy to use and works. Problem was that the next day I woke up looking like I had been punched in both eyes. I could barely open my left eye. Since it works for others I will assume it is just that I didn't realize I have sensitive skin...
4,Ouch,"Found out this is not my cup of tea. It removes hair as promised, it's just that self inflicted pain is far worse than someone else doing it. Getting drunk didn't even help the pain, I ended up pulling hair by hair when I realized the wax wasn't going to come off any other way. I don't plan on ever doing this again."
3,Has the formula changed? this is a sticky mess,"I've used this particular product for about 2 years and thought it was amazing. My recent order however, was blue (not the usual green) and it never hardens. It's gooey, runny and sticks to everything and does NOT remove much hair at all (it just kind of gooey-ly pulls away, taking nothing with it). I'm wondering if they have changed the formula or if I got the wrong wax somehow (but in the same old box)? The wax I received absolutely sucks and I'm uncertain whether I should try ordering again. If this is a new formula then God forbid you get this on the sink or countertop. It literally never hardens..."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was hesitant to try a new hot wax product but have been pleasantly surprised by the quality and effectiveness of this one. One application works every time without any lingering irritation.The only thing I didn't care for was the metal heating container. I didn't want to buy the heating device for it or have to use the stove all the time. So, I warmed up the wax on the stove and poured it all into a small glass jar. Now I can use the microwave to warm up the wax."
4,Really does work!,"It is the most effective wax I have ever used because it really does grab everything and leaves behind super smooth skin! But it hurts like hell, for me anyways, because im pulling it off so slowly. It really only takes one application (gets all those short hairs too) and it is super easy to clean up. I hated all the other at home wax kits because it seems to always get on the bathroom counter or my fingers get sticky, but with this wax, clean up is a breeze. It really works wonders, and my four star rating is really because im a bit traumatized by my last usage - purely my own fault for doing such a wide area all at once.I highly recommend it though! Its the best!"
3,Not really worth the money,"OK, the upside - when layered on thick , it does remove a certain amount of hair. it dries up real quick, and is hence easy to clean...because it can be scraped off most surfaces easily.Flipside - I needed to use this multiple times to completely remove all the hair , and IT ALWAYS HURTS LIKE CRAZY! I've used other microwave wax removal kits, that do a much better job , with much less pain..PLUS, the end result looks very patchy. I also felt the lack of use of waxing strips made it less effective.Overall, you'd be better off using a standard 10$ microwave wax kit."
2,The most painful thing ever,"Works really really well, if you can handle the pain. I like parissa's body sugar wax, but this one was too much for me. I tried it about four different times and could never get over how ridiculously bad it hurt. It does work but i suggest trying something else from them. I still have mine cause I can't even use it."
5,Love it,this wax is awesome and the instructions were super helpful to ensure teh wax doesn't break apart when pulled. It's very easy to heat and re-heat. I am going to stock up on this stuff..it even gets the tiny hairs that grow bewteen waxings.
5,Great for nose hair,"scoop up some hot wax onto a small wooden applicator (e.g.FantaSea Small Waxing Applicators, 25 Count Bag), stuff it in your nose, squeeze your nostril closed, wait a minute, and yank. Viola! Note, I was using tweezers before this so was used to the pulling. This was MUCH less irritating, and took 5 minutes vs 30. There was a little glass vial that broke (some kind of lotion I suppose). Bad packaging for shipping."
5,"Actually removes hair! Effective, safe and easy to use","This really is an excellent product, especially considering the price--it actually removes hair! Better than those strips that do absolutely nothing.The wax is easy to heat up in provided metal container, easy to apply, and easy to peel off. The wax isn't too hot on application nor is it that painful when hair is removed.Great value for the money--I'd buy it again"
5,A fun book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book aloud to my daughters. It's about a little girl born with a really big voice who after struggling to fit in finds her niche in the world. What is a problem to one person often can be a solution to another. And that's the message I got from this book. Emily's loud voice, while annoying her family to the point that they fear her ability to fit into the world, eventually ends up helping others (from the round kitchen cook who needed help calling the servants, to a sea captain who needed help shouting commands to his crew, to a lighthouse whose light was broken and needed someone to warn ships of the rocks). And the artwork is exceptional - wonderfully rich in color! Give this fun book a read!"
4,Fun story - great for preschoolers!,What a fun story for preschoolers - set in a maritime village with lots of vocabulary appropriate to the time period when whaling was a big industry. It is a fun and imaginative tale of misunderstood girl who finds her niche in life! Cute and my 4 year old son loves it!
3,complicated vocabulary!,"I bought this for my 8 mos girl named Emily along with other Emily books but since English is not my first language, I had to use the dictionary for a few words. The story is very funny, but it is too long and complicated even for my 2 yo. I will be a good book for her when she is in 5th or 6th grade."
2,Not as interesting as I hoped.,"I absolutely loved the ""Sailors' Terms and Phrases"" at the beginning of the book. My son loves pirates, so now we will have some new pirate lingo to use when we play pirates.Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for the book didn't hold past that page. I'm not sure why but the story of Emily's loud voice wasn't for me. The illustrations on the other hand, were lovely. The author's note at the end was interesting; perhaps a non-fiction book about the time period and whaling ships would have been much more intriguing."
4,Finally - a bikini wax product that is easy to use and works!,"We spend a lot of time at the beach, so I am frequently in need of bikini waxing (I get a partial Brazilian).I find salon waxing to be expensive, time-consuming and painful.I read about the Parissa wax strips in a magazine, and ordered a kit.They are easy to use, reasonably-priced, and I found them to be much less painful than hot wax.True, it takes longer because the strips are small, and the more difficult-to-reach or see regions are kind of tough to get to, but I will be using these when I just can't get to the salon or am too lazy to. Being able to finally do this relatively easily in the comfort of my own home was a big plus.I recommend the Parissa Face & Bikini Strips highly."
2,"Not enough wax on the strips, dissapointed","I had previously tired the same brand, but larger strips for legs. These little strips do not contain as much wax on them as the leg ones. So, I will go back to the leg ones and just cut them to use on my chin/lip. Dissapointed, as the size is perfect."
3,Only works on face,"This has been working great at removing upper lip hair. However it doesn't get anything from my bikini. I don't know what I could be doing wrong, and yet it simply just doesn't get the hairs down there. Oh well, at least it works for my face."
3,"Okay, at best.",I had hoped for more... I didn't feel like this product was really anything special. Having tried various drug store pickups I didn't feel like this was really anything different. Not a bad product but not a great product by any means.
1,Not wax lyrical,I bought this because it seemed to be the most popular brand (although I stand to be corrected on this). I found the wax too thin to remove hair effectively. I am used to the brand Veet which is sold in Europe. Veet has thicker wax on its strips and works really well but I haven't been able to find it in the US. I won't be buying this Parissa brand again.
3,OK to use,The great thing about this product is that it is not as messy and time consuming as real waxing. I think it is good for a quick job. But it does not remove hair as clean as real waxing
1,Ouch!,I really thought these would be great to use for bikini but they don't. The wax doesn't work well enough to pull out a lot of hair.. If I wanted to rid just one section it would take repeated attempts. Doing so is painful! I bled. If I'm going to wax my bikini I want it done only once in the same spot! Strips are too small and don't work well.
3,Probably wouldn't buy again,I was not able to use the strips more than once. Much happier with veet wax strips.
2,Not that great,"Yeah, they are easy since they are already prepared but I'm not that excited about them. I am a novice waxer and don't trust them on my eyebrows since there is no definition on the strip and I worry about misplacing it. They would probably be okay on fine facial hair but not so great on course hair. I'll use the ones I have left but won't buy them again."
2,Would Not Repurchase,"These strips worked poorly. Strips are faced together with their plastic backs on the outside for your hands. You rub the strips together to warm and soften, then peel them apart to expose the wax. Then you quickly place the strips on the desired area and pull against the direction of hair growth. They did not remove the hair as promised, and I'm not especially hairy.The problem is that these don't separate evenly after warming so you get one strip that has enough wax and another that doesn't. They're supposed to be good for multiple passes, but there isn't enough wax to do two effective passes, let alone the five or six the directions say you should get.Not having been professionally waxed before using them, I didn't know how ineffective they actually were until I did go in for a professional bikini wax. I would not recommend these as these are both more painful than a professional wax and significantly less effective."
4,A Great Alternative to Salon Waxing,"I use these on my legs and they work great! I've gotten salon waxing previously but paying $60 for full leg waxing gets expensive quickly and these are a great alternative. You have to get used to how to use them and, as with any wax, they don't always get the finest hairs but I am a big fan!"
4,Who needs a salon?,"The strips do the job for a fraction of the price and 99% as good as having the job done at a salon, without ever having to leave home. Just get a good mirror, and you are set."
1,Way too tiny and not very effective,"It was my first time waxing. And I thought the strips would be fabric strips, but the strips are actually a thin clear plastic with narrow areas of wax on them. Yeah, these strips are too small! And the wax would stick to the skin and the hair that the strip failed to pull out. I agree with a lot of the other reviews that said the strips don't have enough wax to pull out all the hair and that these are a waste of money. Would definitely not buy these again!"
3,Went the cheap way....,"I definitely prefer getting waxed by a professional, but since I didn't want to spend over $100 I bought this because of the good ratings it already had. This was my first time waxing myself and it was harder than I thought. The plastic strips that the wax comes on can get slippery and it was difficult to know if the wax was at the right temperature. I guess it helps if you have experience."
3,Not what was advertised,This book was supposed to be two stories and was only the one. I did write to seller and did not get a response.
5,Awesome Anthem to be... a crowd favorite..,"This is a crowd favorite, definitely an anthem... The hook which is simple just makes everyone sing along. THE MASSIVE BEAT makes everyone JUMP ALONG. A DEFINITE in any dance enthusiast's collection. Let's just say in a summer where Sandstorm and Zombie Nation were slammin, on my turntables ""Where Are You"" has been the perfect complement! GET IT!ONE OF THE ALL-TIME SATURDAY FAVORITES AT SISSY K's!!"
4,Grandmother of time review,"We have been celebrating winter solstice for several years and I wanted to get more info about other ""pagan"" rituals - more for fun than for religious reasons. The book does not go into too much depth (more hearsay than actual research it seems), but is very helpful if you are looking for a reason to celebrate something new and find out about the sources of things."
3,The grandmother of time,"A very special book, that gives ideas for feasts and holidays through the year. Every month begins with a Goddess who tells the story of that month, and then the days of the month follow with feast for all kinds of Goddesses. The nice part of this book is that there are so many different feasts and Goddesses, everyone can find a Goddess of her liking here.The only thing that I can say against this book is that sometimes the historical information is not correct, due to Budapest's overwhelming feminism, that gets a bit irritating after a while."
3,Good theory but no practice,"The book is good on theory. But weak in examples of real use. You can have sometimes a sensation of understand. But, don't know how to put it in practice. Next edition may be... five stars for theory and zero for none examples. Three stars is good."
4,Great overall book,"This book is being used with a 9 & 7 year old for homeschool. The book gives very interesting information about all the different types of habitats and the animals within. It does talk about mating of animals, so if your child is not ready yet for this information, don't just hand them the book to read. I have been reading the books to my kids and explaining things they don't understand."
5,beautiful music,i'm so happy that i got this cd. it's wonderful to listen to when i'm having a stressful and irritating day. it's very calming and soothing.
4,Pure Moods defines the potential of the New Age movement.,"If I were to rate this CD, I would say that it is an essential collection of music whether you are into New Age or not. If you aren't, then you will be upon listening it. It has established its ambient roots in our society with its transcendent depths. Once you listen to it, you will quickly recognize ""Sail Away"" and ""Adiemus"" which are familiar because of their use commercially, but you will quickly appreciate their range beyond commercial value. It is a wonderful CD."
3,Nice Start,"This collection of Pure Moods CDs started with this CD and was definitely good enough to justify the rest of the entries in the series. These CDs start by taking pop songs, remaking them into semi-new age songs and then collecting them with other new age songs. They're nice and relaxing and just edgy enough to keep mainstream folks interested. SInce this is the first in the series the balance between new age and pop was still being worked on and is more on the new age side. Enough for me to only give this 3 stars since I'm not a huge new age fan."
2,Pure Moods Vol 1,To be honest I was disappointed there so little of Enya on this disc! I was not impressed with much of the other tracks which were not to my taste.....
2,"Ahhh, nothing like PURE MOODS","You know, sitting in the bathroom is an arduous, lonely, BORING task. If you're ever feeling, shall we say, ""stuck"" while performing your duty, then this collection is for you. Straight from the medicated folks at the PURE MOODS factory comes the first in their installment of the groundbreaking PURE MOODS collection. An assortment of new age spacey music guaranteed to loosen the bowels of the most stubborn problems. Be forewarned and invest in a clean pair of shorts before listening..."
5,May the best cd for a new age beginner,"May the best cd for a new age beginner, I don't have it but I would like to, but ten years ago!!"
4,Very Refreshing New Age Compilation CD!!,"I became interested in the CD when they advertised it on TV. Some of the music on the CD are interesting choices (Mark Isham's ""My wife with Champagne Shoulders"" and ""The X-Files dance re-mix"".). Above all, this is a very rewarding gathering of light sounds, smooth voices and meditating melodies that will sooth your soul."
5,This is truly the best of new age!,"When I'm practicing Tai'chi,I listen to ""Orinoco Flow"".When I want to relax,I listen to ""Adiemus"" or ""Sweet Lullaby"".When I want listen to my favorite,hands down,it's ""The Promise""."
5,This is Great Stuff!,"A friend has the CD and he loaned it to me during my recovery from hystorectomy surgury. The music is alternately relaxing, inspiring, calming and upbeat. I didn't want to return the CD to him, but now that I have found Amazon, I will soon be making it-and Pure Moods 2-part of my collection."
5,Pure Moods Delight,I love pure moods the nice relaxing music is greati totally recommend this product
4,Great variety.,This CD got me interested in New Age music. Even after ten plus years the songs sound as wonderful as they did the first time I heard them.
5,Return to Good Music,"I haven't heard the entire CD but, I have heard Return to Innocence and Sail Away. And these songs totally rock!!!People need to listen to more music like this."
5,Great Mix,Saw this one on TV and normally just ignore those commercials but his one really got to me and I found myself searching frantically in stores and TV to find it again. Absolutely wonderful CD for anyone. Love it!!
5,IT'S SO RELAXING,"When I saw this album being advertise on television i'd paid no attention to it, then a friend of my bought the album on CD, he invited me to listen to it, and so I did, after hearing it one time I was really impressed on the music, how it just relaxes the mind and takes it out to great thoughts and spirits. If you like music that relaxes the mind and takes it to a world of wonderful spirits and so on then Pure Moods is just the kind of music to listen to. It's so relaxing."
5,Pure Moods Vol 1: Enigmatic beginning....,"As a New Age listener along with other genres, I came across the Pure Mood's collection during a Amazon.com search for other products. I read the album listing and many of the artists I have heard of and most importantly enjoyed listening too. If you like new age, soft or ambient music you must get this CD and then follow it with the other volumes of Pure Moods. This CD will not be disappointing. The track listing starts off with one of my favourite artists, Enigma and the choice of song 'Return To Innocence' is a beautiful piece of new age ambience. The 17 songs are definitely pure listening pleasure and I have played this CD on many occassions. This will stay in my music collection for many years to come."
4,Dynaflex Powerball Orange,"Due to time constraint, I haven't been able to use this product to see if it is effective to improve my Tennis elbow or not. However, here are what my thought so far:Pros:- Proud to be Made in USA, now a day it's really a rarity.- Superior Quality workmanship in comparison to the crappy one made in China that doesn't work at all or broke after a short period of time.- It could strengthen the forearm. My forearm getting tired after 5 min of exercise with normal rotation.Cons:- A bit noisy. I wonder if it is possibly to lubricate the mechanism or not.- Wish the device can be started easier without the string."
5,awesome,this product is awesome for physicial therpy i got it for my husband who is in the army and has a damaged shoulder we were using a tenis ball but the tenis ball just got borining for him he loves the dynaflex with the flashy lights its fun for him to play with and get his therpy in it did make him a lil sore after playing with it for the first couple days but now he loves it
3,It was good but didn't last,"It worked good for awhile, I've actually had about 2-3 of them. Its just that after awhile, they get dust in them and start to slow down. I used to use it almost everyday and it lasted about 1-2 months."
4,Once you get it started...,"We, too, had trouble figuring out how to start this spinning. The string that came with it was useless. I wound up using the bottom of a neoprene wrist rest as a runway to give the Powerball enough starting momentum that I could then spin it up to a useful velocity. It's fun to use, though loud. I can feel it strengthening various small muscles in my hands/forearms."
1,Worked great for two weeks and the broke,I used this product for two weeks. It was working well and then suddenly stopped gyrating. It is out of balance or something and just doesn't work. It was handled with care and used as intended. It is not well made.
2,Wrist Exerciser,"This wrist device COULD BE PERFECT if the string for rewinding really worked. Since there is a string included in the package you would think that it would be enough for using this device. But not so. The string stopped working the first week, it got stuck, it spunn and the ends got so fringed that it no longer fit in the rewinding holes. Why should I have to buy a charger when it's not included in the package and it's not said anywhere that it's required? What a shame, that a nice product becomes a negative experience."
4,Good Product just sent wrong one,It is a very good product I use it about every day but they sent me the Dynaflex Pro Plus Gyro instead of the powerball blue light one. The Pro is fine just not as strong as the Powerball. The only reason I knocked it one star was I cant judge the powerabll never getting to try it.
3,I've seen better dynaflex power balls.,"For some reason this ball ground inside its container and was difficult to use. It wouldn't keep going even with the thread starter. It looked used and I'm just not sure that this was an uninspected return from some other consumer. I have seen new, shiny ones that worked easily and spun relentlessly compared to this."
2,Just a toy,"If you are looking for some entertainment, then this toy will also help you develop strong forearms. However if you are serious about exercising, then this toy will just frustrate you. It takes too long to get it going (like winding a yoyo) and to keep it going requires some skill. It is too easy to loose the rhythm and then you must restart it. For those that just want to concentrate on exercise this is too frustratingly complex. The only way to start it is with a special little string that is very easy to loose (or the optional starter motor). I purchased this for my kids thinking that they would develop their arms for Little League. They were not strong enough or coordinated enough to keep it going and lost interest very quickly. Granted this is the highest resistance model and maybe the 9,000 RPM version would work better for kids."
2,slightly defective..,"My powerball came with a slightly defective mechanism or groove inside the ball, it isn't as smooth as my other powerball."
3,Useful,This product takes some practice. The dominant side can work it easily but my offhand is much more difficult. With practice I'm sure it will improve Seems to really work the forearms and wrists.
5,ARM PUMP MIRACLE,"I race motocross and have yet to find a better workout for my forearms. Anyone who rides knows that arm pump is the devil, and the only way to reduce it is to build resistance to it by increasing the endurance and strength of your forearms and hands. The best way to do this is just to get more seat time, but when you can't be on the track, the Powerball will give you that workout in seconds."
2,Poor quality and lack of customer service,"I bought one after seeing a friends. Mine was very hard to spin up. Had to use a string pull to get it started. Then it started getting harder to keep going. Contacted dynaflex about replacement, service, advice etc. All I got was you must have abused, dropped etc. Very poor communication style with all caps and misspelled words on top of accusations I was responsible for the loss in performance.I enjoyed using it the 30 - to 40 times I could keep it going.A friends powerball pro with no lights is much easier to spin up and has been working for hundreds of spins. Maybe I got a lemon but the customer service experience was bad."
2,Product not as promised,What i got was a normal powerball and none of the blue light stuff that was promised.
3,"Be aware, its an old dvd","Firstly let me say that I love Ron Covell, I think he is a great fabricator and I have some of his other DVD's and they are truly excellent. The material contained within is really good, I love the way he presents and love watching his other DVD's. However, I don't know if this is DVD was created from a really poor master but the quality, and I am talking about the picture quality, is really poor. I returned my copy because I felt that it was pretty unwatchable. I even complained to the seller that I thought that they were selling copies but they were great and they reassured me that it was an original bought directly from the manufacturer and offered me loads of compensatory items. So that's it, great content but watch out for the quality."
4,Quickbed,"The Quickbed was just what we needed for our motor home. It was hard to find a double size inflatable mattress in the stores, so this what just what we were looking for. Can also use it in the house for extra sleeping space. Worked out great."
5,Awesome,the coleman full size quickbed was is a really good item really enjoy it Thank you will buy from you again
2,Pump does not fill all the way,the only issue i had was that the pump that the bed came with does not fill the bed all the way. it doesn't have that much power. I had to use a bicycle pump with a different nozle to complete the job.that's it.
5,Great Item,We used this air mattress on a recent beach trip and loved it. It was easy to inflate and deflate. It is also very easy to pack back in it's own carrying case. It is not covered in rubber so you don't feel like you are stuck on your sheet when you try to turn over. Great item for the price.
1,lasted less than 2 months,well it was great while it lasted. ordered dec 29th all of a sudden on feb 23 it stared to loose air. i am very careful. it was not damaged.has egg crate foam on top and sheet. my back pain was gone sleeping on this thing. to bad. going to try to send back warranty says 1 year. we will see.
3,took a while...,"Looked all over for a good deal on air mattresses for houseguests. Coleman has good reviews and actually has a warranty. It arrived quickly, but the pump didn't work! Tried everything- new batteries. upside down batteries. shaking. smacking, etc. No dice. Had to borrow an air compressor, which did not do the job of filling the mattress. Then, right when i was about to send it off for a refund, i tried the pump once more. And, voila! It worked, and works great. So my lesson is to give the air pump 3 days if it isn;t working before returning... now the mattress is great."
1,I was expecting something better,"The pumps need batteries and the mattress lose air easily over night, is not what i was expected, I read the comments before buying but i do not agree ..."
2,not durable,this item was not durable . it got a leak we can nopt find after 3 camping trips. price was low but maybe thats why. it came with a pump that is battery operated and works great
1,Poor quality,"The full size Coleman Quickbed's air mattress leaked so much, we were constantly pulling out the pump to add more air. After a few weeks, a compression point popped. It was quickly followed by another, making the mattress look as if it had developed a goiter. We were going to return the air mattress, but weren't pleased with Coleman's return policy and tossed the now unusable mattress.Coleman Full Size Quickbed with 4D Pump and Wrap 'N' Roll Storage"
2,Bump,"The bed was nice to start, but also when I filled it, the bed had a weird bump in one of the corners. It did not last to long and ended up getting a leak in it."
5,Coleman Double-Sized Quickbed with 4D Pump,"The first time use was in my motor home and both my granddaughters slept on it with no discomfort. They had a great time sleeping, especially when both hate to sleep in the same bed."
4,"Nice air mattress, wish they offered a built-in pump","Air mattress was comfortable and didn't lose much air at night (hard to say if it lost any because we were camping and the mattress was on the cold ground). I like the way it rolls up into it's ""bag"". Great for camping or for having guests over. I do wish it had a built in pump though, as it's kind of a pain having a separate pump to keep up with that has no storage."
4,It is OK,I bought this item and I've used it only once. It was OK specially because it comes with the pump. I'd use it again and I recommend it.
2,Coleman Quickbed with Pump,"While the overall quality of the Coleman Double ComfortSmart Quickbed (w/ Pump)was acceptasble, the description did not indicate what kind of pump (battery operated or DC) was included. We were disappointed to find that the pump, which apparently impacts the price of the product dramatically, was a cheap, plastic container, for which four ""D"" batteries needed to be purchased. The description failed to explain this. A similar product, w/o the ""pump"" was located at a grocery store for less than 1/3 the price.Overall, VERY over priced with misleading (incomplete) copy. Product would have been returned immediately if not needed."
4,Good air mattress,Easy to set up and take down. Very comfortable to sleep on for two people. The price was right and is exactly what was expected
2,"Leaks - Have to return to manufacturer, not Amazon","Mattress is smaller than a full-sized mattress and leaks. Can't return to Amazon, but must pay extra to ship back to manufacturer. It's a disappointment because I chose a Coleman over an Aerobed because most reviewers did not have leak issues."
2,"Good for three hours, then requires reinflation","I purchased this based on good Amazon reviews. My husband moved our house three weeks before my 10-year-old and I finished the school year, so we stayed behind and I bought this for us to sleep on. I spent double what the cheap mattresses cost. It all works great, but I have to get up every three hours and reinflate it or else we're on the hardwood floor."
1,Disappointment,We tried this mattress for several night and it absolutely would not hold air. Sent it back. What a pain in the neck.
3,Does the job but part was missing,"Mattress was missing the pump nozzle, but I was able to use the it by holding it in place as I inflated the mattress. Not the most efficient. Mattress leaked a bit during the night but that was to be expected."
4,good deal,it's a smart idea that we bought this airbed. it's soft and comfortable to sleep on. i just wish it comes with an electric pump.
1,Worst. Mattress. Ever.,"I pulled the mattress out of the box, and placed it on a freshly vacuumed and mopped hard wood floor and slept on it for two weeks. Because of the reviews I had read before buying, we were excessively gentle with it. when my new home was ready, we very gently rolled it up and moved it ten minutes away. My friend made fun of me for being so protective of it. It was deflated for maybe a half hour.At the new place, I again laid it on a very clean floor. It stayed inflated for maybe an hour. It never worked again.Seriously, I hate air mattresses, and this one is another great example of why. I needed it for 6 weeks, and I got 2.Thanks for nothing Coleman!"
3,"Good Mattress, bad battery operated pump","The mattress is very good - firm and easy to tuck away. Blows up very quickly and doesn't deflate during the night. Unfortunately, the pump that came with it is battery operated and after buying the batteries the pump worked once and then broke. I already had visitors with me so I had no time to return it. I had to buy a new pump (I suggest cord operated)in order to use the mattress. Overall, great mattress but disappointed with the battery operated pump."
4,Good value,"Pretty cozy, especially for the price. The coil pattern is a much nicer and more comfortable alternative to the ones with ribs. Also very convenient that it comes with the pump and the wrap. My only complaint (and it's minor) is that the pump requires D batteries, which are expensive, and then it is only a one-way pump (as opposed to slightly nicer models, which can both inflate and deflate your mattress), so you still have to sacrifice a bit of dignity rolling around on top of the nearly-flat mattress to get the rest of the air out."
3,Solid and Reliable Product but PUMP IS HORRIBLE,"Bed- wonderful, durable product retains air well and comfortable once you're used to air beds. I am using as a temporary bed since I am away from home for a few months and so I spend 12+ hours on it per day.Pump- absolute crap. batteries lasted less than an hour so I ended up using my roommate's plug in pump."
1,Dead on arrival :(,"I got this mattress and tried to pump it, but noticed, that there was a hole (at last one) for about 4mm in length on the top side. As i can see, this guys aren't even checking their ""production"". Don't buy this crap - you'll just waste your money."
5,Fits in the Bed of our Avalanche Truck,We needed to find a air mattress that fit in the back of our truck for when we go camping. This Double air mattress fits perfect. We add the air in the mattress right where we want it to sit for the weekend. It fits snug so neither of us rolls off. Plus Coleman makes their air mattresses roll up nice and takes up little space. It fulfills the need we had and saved us lots of money. Those truck air mattresses are very expensive and fit looser... Very excited to used it all summer!!!
5,Great traveling backpack,"I am traveling to Africa with a friend and needed a carry-on luggage that I would also be able to carry around myself for long periods of time when I get there. I have packed all my stuff into it, including my sleeping bag, and I have practices carrying it around the house. It has so many straps that you can pull tighter after you've zipped it up, so it ends up a smaller size than you think at first. The padded straps make it really comfortable to hold for long periods of time and it has the added support of chest and waist straps. You can even put your water bottle on the side. It's a perfect back pack for what I needed for my trip."
4,Buena mochila!,"Buena mochila, bastante amplia cfon varios compartimientos.Como en el cuarto viaje, se rompió uno de los ganchos de plástico y tuve que hacer un par de nudos.Es preferible quitarle los fierros que vienen en la parte trasera para que pese menos."
4,Easy read,"I enjoyed reading this book. It had just the right amout of naughty and suspense. I love RJ ward, she has awesome style."
2,disappointed,usually love J.R. Ward's work but this just didn't cut it. felt like a rush job just to get a book out. characters were good but didn't get deep enough. the book is fluffy whereas usually the're gripping.
4,Romance Novel,"I like JR Ward and her vampire series so I thought I'd try these others. The read is fine but not enough of a mystery that I apparently need to really like a book. But, it kept me entertained!"
4,"Sorcerer Hunters, Vol. 3","I couldn't have asked for more in the third installation of this seris. Well, mabye a little bit more. Anyway, the story continues it's funny romp through the sorcerer hunting world, with the charecters getting themselves into some weird situations. Plenty of jokes, action, and even a little bit of emotion can all be found on this tape. We even finally find out something about that dark sorcerer guy who made random appearences during volume 1. Anyway, it was an enjoyenble installment. My only complaint is that it only had two episodes!"
5,What A Great Man,"This book was the best book that I have ever read.In my opinion, Jeremiah was one of the greastest war heroes. He was strong and courageous in the eyes of the enemy and he never backed down. He endured the torture, agony, loneliness, and so much more for so long.I cannot even begin to imagine myself in any of those situations. I have such great respect for that man. My words cannot begin to describe the feeling that you will have while reading this book."
3,"Good, but not great","The reality is there is little information for this part of the world. This is good information, but its not great and it does lack in certain areas, I don't know of a better book so I'd reccomend it, but do lots of homework before you go the information changes quickly."
4,Excellent,"A creative magician of seamless similes and metaphors, Carter's voice often finds a flow that carries the reader along outside of time. When your eyes eventually rise up to your bookshelf or cold cup of tea, you realize you've been taken to places you might not ever reveal had you been where she's been; and it's way past bedtime. But Carter's a brave writer who pulls back most of the curtains on her life. What you see will disturb you, but by the last page you're left grateful for her blood honesty and for the bit of humanity she's added to your life.For the author: A simple plea. Please write more."
4,"Tour de force, one-woman show","Despite Carter was a new writer, she already establisehd herself as a master story teller in this colleciton. Her first person accounts are confessional prose poem like, yet objective, fearless and pitiless self-exposition. They are told in brutality of her candor, at times with the entirely collected self-awareness. Even there were moments her control sucummbs to some dullness and remote and uninvolving mode, which all happened when she attempted the third person narration, you still have to read and experience Carter's tour de force."
4,December + Stillness = Greatness!,"December Stillness is a great, easy-to-read, story of a girl who wants to get to know a veteran for a school paper. The book is great!!! You can get inside of Kelly's head and feel what she feels. When with her frieds I could totally understand what was going on in her mind.Bottom Line: Great book, must read!"
4,December Stillness,"This book was an insperation for me. It was really encouraging to read a book with someone in it that had feelins and who cared about another person who's not doing well like Mr. Weems. We don't see that in the world today. Even though this book was written more than a decade ago, it still should be read and applied to peoples lives today. Read this book if you haven't already. You will be highly amazed."
1,December Stillness,I didn't like this book one bit. Kelly was stupid in my opinion. She shouldn't of bothered Mr. Weems. I shuttered when they spoke of how she dressed. I don't think this book is very good and I wouldn't have even thought about reading it if my teacher hadn't made me.
2,Not the best- Here's why,"Although this book had a good theme and morals, the text was littered with historical inaccuracies. This book also seemed formulaic and slow. Being an English teacher, I immediately note that there were no literary devices or motifs which would make this book a superior one. I was forced to have my advanced freshman class read this book, because it was on the curriculum. I personally support the crude, yet understandable statement that one of my students made; ""This book seems like just another turd from the crap-factory of Mary Downing Hahn."""
5,Future Christmas Classics!!,This CD is comprised of 10 new Christmas compositions that truly speak to the soul of any Christian. You won't find the same over-done Christmas songs here!!Merry Christmas!!
4,Ideal book for a 'beginner',"This book, as is often the case with this kind of book, emphasises on winning dogs in Britain and a few other countries. But the part of the book that is really really excellent is the grooming and training-part. If you read and study this groomingmanual well than you'll be able to strip and groom your schnauzer all by yourself! Have fun doing it!"
2,Not one of his best.,"Not one of his best. But then it is an early work, and as much as I love his later stuff the early books pale in comparison."
4,For a Good Deep Laugh ...,Read Chapter 19 - [location 1749]. Written so that you can see the whole thing happening. Can stand alone. Beautifully crafted.
4,Early Wodehouse Is Silly Fun,"Not his very best, but still very amusing. Title says all about the plot: boy meets girl among chickens, boy loses girl among chickens, boy wins girl among chickens. A quick read, under-plotted by Wodehouse's later standards.NOTE: This, and all Wodehouse's early stuff (20 or 30 years' worth!), is available in its entirety online! For free!"
4,"Yeah, I doubted too, but so much fun!","Ok, when my friend told me there was this free amazon book I HAD to have, I admit I was a skeptic. love among the chickens?-very weird! But this book is tons of fun, with robust characters, ridiculous conversations, and enough absurdity that I found myself giggling aloud at times. No, it's not the great literature of our times, yes it is a blast to read. Seriously, what do you have to lose? ONLY for people who have a sense of humor, the rest of you can skip it."
3,Weak first grown-up novel,"This is Wodehouse's first novel for grown-ups, though only available in an edition revised years later. It's better-plotted than his earlier schoolboy novels, and shows some hints of his later genius, but only hints. Wodehouse uses some of his signature plot devices, but he uses them here without irony, unlike in his mature work. (I sometimes suspect that Wodehouse's later work parodies his early work.) Oddly, though Ukridge is supposedly based on a real person, he is one of Wodehouse's most implausible characters, generally acting preposterously merely to advance the plot. The style is quite good, though, so I suspect that the 1920 version was fairly thorough rewrite of the 1906 original, a point on which there is some dispute. (The reference to Maxim Gorky, Trotsky, and Lenin in chapter 10 seems unlikely to have been written in 1906, for example.)"
3,Lights are hard to insert.,Overall lights are very nice looking. I had trouble inserting the light sockets into light holes . Best price I have found on replacement lights.
3,"Out of 4 purchased, only 2 worked.",I purchased 4 of these. Only 2 worked for my water heater. I was hoping to have a backup for future.
2,You will NOT get what is described.,"Got my order for the fuses...they are supposed to be Bussman fusetron fuses, carded 2packs. They are neither. They are bulk fuses, loosely wrapped, and some generic off-brand, NOT the Bussman fusetron fuses advertised. Pretty shady if you ask me. I guess they will still work for my application, but I am NOT a fan of bait and switch tactics."
5,Not for archaeology buffs only!,"This book takes the reader thorough the history of pre-columbian mesoamerica, the daily life of the people and then tours a number of important archaeological sites in Mexico and nearby countries. It includes wonderful photos of amazing artifacts decorative pieces, ceramics and jeewlry and the archaeological sites. It is a stunning book and serves to emphasize the colossal loss the Americas sustained with the conquest. If you've been to Mexico and love it, this book is a nice memento. If you havn't, this will make you want to go."
1,Broken Horseshoes,"Two of the horseshoes broke after a few weeks of normal use. Poor quality or just bad luck? In any case, I wouldn't buy these again. Another problem - there isn't enough contrast between the two colors. After a little wear, they are hard to tell apart."
1,Junk,Broke after second use! Stakes too skinny and short. Opposing shoe colors indistinguishable with out eyeballing stamped letter. Over priced for poor quality!
4,Classic movie,We watched this with our kids this past weekend and I was reminded how funny and enjoyable this movie was. Our kids thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
2,Cracked case,I was pleased with the short amount of time it took for the movie to arrive but when it arrived the movie case was cracked
4,good family entertainment.,Entertaining and funny.Rented and watched it last night.I was as I expected it to be. Funny and decent.
4,I love this Movie,"I love this movie from Pixar, I Dvr'ed it when it was on tv and I found myself watching it every other day, it's really funny. I was thrilled when disney re-released it on blu-ray dvd. **The only reason I gave this review four out of five stars is because I'm unsure if the standard dvd includes the Short Film 'Partysauras Rex' This is my only gripe with disney, If you include bonus features on just one format it leaves out Others who don't own a blu-ray player."
1,Region 2,"Be warned that Region 2 DVD's will not work on players in the USA (at least not any of my 3) I had to return it, but the service of the return and the initial shipping from the seller was great."
4,Fantastic story of a career working on the railroad,"This is the story of a senior foreman responsible for maintaining the tracks of a railroad through some of the most difficult terrain in the country. With the tools and hand they kept the line open against the forces of nature and human mistakes. Written in plain, no nonsense opinionated storytelling of someone trying to share their remarkable experience."
4,Nothing is wrong.,It arrived on time and nothing is wrong. No problem to use it for my blower.It arrived on time and nothing is wrong. No problem to use it for my blower.
2,Politically Correct Advice to Graduates,"I looked, but could only find eight or nine provocative excerpts from commencement addresses. The remainder were politically correct generalities. A large number of addresses were delivered at Smith College and Sara Lawrence College. If you want to get the advice of Steinem, Winfrey, Jordan, King, Edelman, Cosby, Du Bois, this is the book for you."
4,Yoga Block and Strap,These yoga accessories work well and were a great value for the price paid. I'm very happy with this purchase.
4,Replacement bulbs are easy to find,The replacement bulbs are C-7 clear transparent replacement bulbs for twinkle lights or blinking lights. They can be found online 4 for $3.00 or anywhere they sell christmas lights.This lamp is so much fun.
3,Can I find replacement bulbs??,"It's a cute product. However, the bulbs burned out way too fast on us and now I can't find out how to replace the bulbs and get them to blink. I can't find blinking light bulbs and the instructions were useless as to whether there is a fuse to change or not. One extra bulb is not enough."
1,Useless!,"This light is absolutely useless. You can either turn the light on or off. If on, the three bulbs flash irregularly; if off, obviously no light is produced. I bought the light to be a bedside light for my sons' room. Not a chance it can be used for that purpose. Nor can it be used as a nightlight: how are kids going to fall asleep with a flashing light in the room? The only use I can imagine is as a toy, but what kid is going to be entertained by this for long? This product is a complete waste and I'm angry that I wasted my time finding it online, buying it, picking it up at the store (Walmart), and then returning it."
1,Gnats Everywhere,I also purchased this potting soil and repotted all the plants in my home. Now I have gnats everywhere. I thought this was the best potting soil and paid more for it only to end up with gnats. Hundreds of them. I wish I had read the previous post before. Do not buy this product. Now it will cost me double to buy another brand and the work of repotting about 40 plants.
1,Thousands of little bugs FREE with every bag!,We repotted about a dozen houseplants a month ago with Miracal Gro potting soil. I've sprayed the soil with indoor insecticide and these little bugs just look up at me a laugh. Insecticidal soap doesn't faze them either. Let's see... Miracle Gro is a division of Ortho and Ortho sells bug spray. Conspiracy theories anyone?
1,"Bugs, grass, and plants!","I've been using this for the past few years, but this year, I've not only found the bugs, but I actually have a WEED that grew and punctured through the bag! I kept wondering where all the weeds were coming from in my planter boxes, and now I know!"
1,Still has Gnats,"Like the other reviewers, I too have had bad luck with this brand of potting soil. I had purchased several bags and repotted a lot of my house plants with it, and all those that I did started having gnat problems within a week. Its been very frustrating, they get everywhere but seem to leave my plants that I didn't repot with this particular potting soil alone."
2,"Stop Bugging Me, or Soiled Soil","I too have been ""bugged"" by black flying insects in my Miracle-Gro potting soil. I've thrown out bug-contaminated soil, and sprayed with insect killer. I went online to see if others were having the same problem with Miracle-Gro soil, and they have. I also wrote an email to Scott's, the company that manufactures Miracle-Gro, and am hoping to get a response (probably not, but you never know!) In the meanwhile, I'm going to see if I can find a cleaner soil to pot my plants in."
2,Gnats,"I transplanted a ficus to a larger pot (no gnats previously), and soon after our bathroom was infested with gnats. I like the response I get from my plants outdoors with MiracleGro's potting mix, but I will never use this again for indoor plants."
2,Not impressed.,"I bought this for all my deck containers this year, and I'm not really that impressed with it. The plants look fine, but I have way fewer flowers than I've ever had using regular potting soil. I also had two plants die, and I have no idea why. I read one other review that said her plants were cooking in the sun - that the contents of her containers felt HOT to her. This could be my exact problem as well. Both plants that died were in full sun. Next year I will buy regular potting soil and a big package of Miracle Grow plant food instead!"
2,Gntas and wood chips.,I too have had tons of gnats come out of the potting soil. Didn't they sterilize soil in the past? I bought it to make grow grass seeds for the cats to chew on.I would spray it with bug spray but for the fact that I don't want to poison the cats. I've had some of the soil in planter for 2 months and its still making gnats. I didn't have that problem with the soil that came with the Chia novelty cat grass seeds and soil. The Miracle potting mix has a lot of wood chips in it. I would prefer 100% soil instead of 25% wood chips that cause the gnats. I guess Potting Mix is different than Potting soil. I used to sell New Era potting soil that was good dark earth with nothing else added to it. Live and learn.
1,Gnats all over my house from this product!,"I bought 4 bags of this stuff and repotted everything in my house. Within a week I had gnats all over my house. I have tried everything and cant get rid of them! Terrible, use a different organic product."
3,EEEEWWWW.... GNATS!!,I use to buy this all the time with no problems. I had brought other soil that didn't compare to the quality of this one but the last go 'round of pots I soiled are infested with gnats. An extreme amount. Its spread to my other plants and the soap water trick is not working.I'll have to buy bug spray for house plants now. Try something else.
4,Did I Get Cheated?,"I read the reviews, and being a novice gardener (was one of my chores as a kid, a very long time ago!), I bought -- but no gnats! I wouldn't know a gnat if I met one, but I encountered nothing moving, and my plants are still in good shape."
1,Gnats and earthworms,"I repotted all my house plants with Miracle Gro last year. All got gnats and earthworms (potted plants don't like earthworms). My plants were never so unhappy and sickly. Not sure that it was the soil to blame, I repotted all the plants with a fresh bag of Miracle Gro in spring (after soaking the roots in water bucket overnight to get rid of the earthworms). Still have gnat and earthworm problems.So it seems that Miracle Gro did not just stop screening the soil. The mix was not heat-treated properly to kill larvae and stuff. Do not use this brand, unless you want unhappy plants, gnat infestation, and earthworms!"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,"I have not used this in few years,but a bought the biggest bag lowes had for around 10 or 12 bucks.I planted some seedlings in a hurry , no sooner got them potted and realized the mistake I made.It is 50% wood chips and pine bark that actually smells like it came from a forest fire.There is nothing it it that even looks like soil.This is just a friendly note to anyone thinking of using this.DONT DO IT,this is crap,junk,the worst.I wont call it garbage,because decomposed food would be way better.I will never buy anything with the Miracle-Gro name on it again."
1,Don't buy,"Gnats everywhere. It also comes bone dry, which means if you plant your seeds/plants without reconstituting first, you will never be able to water the pots enough for the water to soak throughout the mix. I use Miracle-Gro plant food, which works great, but the same cannot be said for their potting soil."
2,Gnats everywhere,"Like many others have said, Gnats! It would be a fine product except for that. Used some insecticidal soap, so far so good. Caveat emptor!"
4,All knowledge is valuable,"Ignore people who says ""don't read this book"" about any book in the world. Absolutely every book on the planet has some knowledge to be gained from. Even if the book doesn't have something you will use, it still taught you what you should and shoudlnt' be looking for, and what you personally believe to be true. Also, not all book's meanings are simple and straightforward...sometimes you have to look deeper...."
3,Just a cookbook,"This is a fun little ""recipe"" book that tells you how to make various crafts. However, after reading it, I decided it really wasn't my kind of book. I wanted to use it more as a brainstorming book, but it didn't inspire me. If you like being creative on your own, look elsewhere. If you feel that you're not creative enough, and would like to follow someone else's ideas, then this book may be right for you! :)"
3,"Not many projects I would make, but some good tips","Frankly, there is not alot of projects in this book I would want to make. I was hoping the box would be a woodbox instead of one that was pasted stuff on. However, it gave me some ideas I can use in my own craft."
4,Magical Crafting,"Wonderful blending of Beautiful Crafts that reflect the ""Craft"" A great look at how you can put a little magic in All that you do."
3,"If interested in simple spells, this is your book.",This is a fine how-to book for beginning spell-casters. Contains a lot of material for review; nothing too exotic. Give it a try.
2,Spells & Crafts,"The author dabbles with many things emphasisng sympathetic and symbolic magical practice on a very basic, elementary level. While this book has some interesting things, the section dealing with the Runes is grossly inaccurate and overly simplistic. The author uses the Runes to spell out charms and spells in ""English"", rather than using the ancient Germanic or Nordic languages, and seems to totally overlook the magical aspects and inherent meanings in the Runes themselves. More and deeper study of the Runes and Runic lore is recommended to the author - especially when he makes use of them as a central part of his book. Altogether this book was very disappointing, especially if you are looking for deeper more powerful material to work with."
2,misleading and shallow,"Although the title claims that this book is about making magickal objects, it's really just another one of Cunningham's bland books with little worth reading. It's more of just a book of spells than anything, with all of them having some sort of object that you make yourself. And like usual Cunningham simply delivers a bunch of spells with no occult or metaphysical explanations for anything. Just spells that are supposed to work even though there is nothing in the name of deep-rooted magickal conncepts. Just like all of Cunningham's other books."
2,The book didn't hold a ton of good info.,"These crafts, for the most part, were totally useless to make, they have no meaning for a wiccan at all. Cunningham doesn't grasp any technique or real ingenuity in this book. My advise? Don't buy it. Believe me, try some of Jennifer Hunter's books instead."
1,"classic? no, junk","I have had this watch for three years, of which it was probably used for a total of three months. It never kept accurate time, plus or minus 2 to 3 minutes a day. Slowlly winding became rough and finally the stem became mechanically seperate from its in ternals. This watch will become no 100 year familly heirloom. Sent it to be repaired at Tissot and they gave an estemate of $360 to fix a $ 400 watch. N0 way. Save your money and buy a seiko or citizen."
4,Great book for those interested in sports marketing,"I used this book when writing my term paper on sports sponsorship and I found it very insightful. Everyone who is interested in sports and sports marketing should read this book. I would highly recommend it for both students and professionals in sports, the book gives you a great tool for creating your own event or help your team get sponsored."
4,Great Textbook!,"She was my professor for my class, ""Sport Marketing."" The book was an excellent read and I learned a lot from her insights."
5,Come back,"I started out with this 25 years ago and after thinking I needed bigger, faster, harder, hipper, moderner workouts I have returned to this one. It is for normal people who just want to keep primed. I don't need to climb Mt. Everest or run an olympic marathon so this is something I can live with. I think its awesome and I wish she would put it on dvd."
1,Absolute Garbage,"Hyperbole aside, this is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. Makes 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' look like 'Citizen Kane'. The people responsible for the creation of this mess should be beaten about the head and neck with lead pipes. There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film and one has to wonder how desperate for a paycheck any of the actors must have been to work on this disaster. Avoid this like the plague."
2,"An old record, just for fans","This is a collection of old songs, most of them originally Italian, performed by a band where Toto Cotugno was the main leader.The Volo AZ504 is the most popular song, and it's still worthy to appreciate. Monja Monja is the most complexed and amazing one however.I did not remember that some other were part of this record: Africa (pretty nave) Santa Maria (more related to simple dance music) and Collezione Privata (1 and 2)with influence of Eurodisco.The record is so heterogenous that it's hard to say it'd be appreciated by all.It's curious that this record from Italy had been re edited by a Korean company and it's sold in an American site,"
2,"Good, yes. Perfect, no.","For those people out there already familiar with Kikaider, I present you with an INFORMED review.As far as my research goes, this is not the ""Perfect"" collection, in that it is missing the 2003 OAV special ""Kikaider vs. Inazuman."" I realize this is because that was never released in the U.S., but incomplete is still incomplete. So don't shell out the $125+ dollars thinking you're going to get that rare gem, because you're not.That being said, Kikaider is an excellent show. If you don't believe me, Google it and educate yourself. The animation is older, yes, and the story is derived from a live-action ""henshin"" series from the 1970's (Kikaider to Power Rangers: ""Who's your daddy?"") but if you have a place in your heart for clashing robots and forbidden love (two great flavors that taste great together) than I urge you to give this show a try.Now if I could just find that OAV special..."
5,Alarming!,"Stephen King has done it again. I have read so many of his books, each time in awe when he produces still another. As a horror writer, of short stories, I am humbled by this man's ability to keep churning out bestseller after bestseller. Cell kept my eyes going up and down the pages, not wanting to tear myself away. Mr. King has the appropriate last name, for he is 'King' of horror.I will never use my cell phone again without thinking of this book.Richard Neal Huffman - author of . . . Well, just google my name."
3,Almost 4 stars,"King is the master of the easy read, and there's nothing too challenging here, though it is an intriguing story. This one seems more derivative than usual--borrowing from himself (""The Stand"" and ""Tommyknockers"") and others (obviously, George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" and Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend""). King's prose is, as usual, very vivid and evocative; no problem seeing the scenes play out. Some nice about-faces keep things interesting. If horror's your thing, you'll probably like it. ""Salem's Lot"" is still my favorite King story, though ""Bag of Bones"" and ""The Stand"" are close seconds."
4,Stephen King at his best...,"The ending was indeed a bit disappointing; however, I suspect that we might re-visit some of these characters in another book.That said, this book's gripping plot kept me at the gym longer than I anticipated. I didn't want to stop reading. As usual, King's writing was top-notch and I highly suggest that if you like his previous books, this one is a winner."
2,NOT THE STAND,"I like Steven King writing very much but this book is a very short version of the stand but it is not the Stand. It is a quick read but missing something. Maybe it was to predictable unlike many of his books or maybe it reminded me of my favorite work by him, the stand, and it came no where close to being as good as the stand."
3,Please hold...,"I am a bit gutted by it to honest. I had high hopes.I didn't feel the depth of character or storyline that we are used to as readers of King, it felt like a book for a book's sake.I love King - I have always read King, I am not being ungrateful at what is an entertaining read, don't get me wrong, but it missed something, I wasn't compelled, I wasn't engrossed, I wasn't blown away!If you read King you will read this - Just don't expect to be wowed, it felt more like a novel of duty and there were some political standpoints in there also that I'm not used to getting from the master that felt alien as I read them.Long, perhaps too long, the end came on suddenly and there was no resolution, while I understand that not all good endings are happy ones I would have settled for something out of this, I mean, after all the trouble the lead character goes to get his son back, does he succeedd in normalising him?Without a true end you feel jilted, the characters never really got off the ground."
1,one of his worst,"The difficulty King always has had to write a proper ending has now progressed to the point where is no longer able to write a proper book. This book should have been written as a short story, with a nice open ending. Now its one of his worst books."
4,I liked it,"This is a pretty quick read but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I am a fan of the ""Zombie"" genre, mostly in films. This is really the first book I've read that could be classified in that genre, although zombies are not really what they are in this book. Once again I was very much in tune with the characters in the book and felt deep sorrow when any central character met with some sort of tragic event. That's what I love most about Stephen King novels, the characters are people that I feel I know and am friends with many times. This is not the best King book I've ever read, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it to any King fan or ""zombie"" fan."
3,Better than his last books,"I grew up reading Stephen King and in his best years he was a remarkable author of horror and horror/fantasy themed novels, but I have not been able to get into his last 4-5 books and have tried a few times but I can't get past the first couple of pages of his gunslinger books either. Like some other reviewers, I felt this book opened strong and I was very jazzed that the old SK was back.... I held on and made it through, and I have to say - the review of yet another reader - who called this a Stand-lite made me laugh, because I thought back to that great novel, that I have read and reread once every five years or so...... and felt - this novel had a chance for greatness, but never really got there.... and then it was over.... and I was sad... because we had a taste of the Old Stephen, if only for a little while... keep trying Mr. King - we miss ya (I really felt like giving it a 3.5 - but only a 5 point scale)"
3,Did they forget to include the last couple of chapters?,"I found this book very interesting. The premise grabs you and, unlike a lot of King, he stays focused on moving the narrative forward. The characters are interesting and well-developed. And, as the ""phone-crazies"" evolve, the novel takes on a more ""immediate"" sense of danger. It leads to a thrilling.....nothing. No resolution, no explanations, no conclusions. The ending felt more like the ending of a chapter, not the novel. So, three stars. If the ending had been more solid, I would have certainly rated it higher."
2,Goes Nowhere,"Sometimes Stephen writes like he has no idea where the plot is going. I got this feeling from Gunslinger after just 3 books and now with Cell. If it were the first in a series he might find his way but he gave up on this one too soon. Part of the problem is that the Pulse is a world-wide phenomenon and a few ""normies"" aren't going to solve such a problem no matter what the cause, a cause that he leaves completely unknown. Even the subplots go unanswered, unlike Dome, where it's a local and therefore solvable crisis, complete with all his witty observations on human character which he's good at. Anyway, a bit of a disappointment unless he finishes it up with a second novel."
2,Kept waiting for the punchline...,"I really had a lot of hope for this book. It started off with a bang and I expected it to end with one. Well technically it did end with a bang, but not the kind I mean.Besides the obvious lack of character development and the resulting lack of empathy towards them, it was just extremely predictable. I kept thinking as I read this, ""ahhh, okay Stevie wants us to think this is going to happen, but that's too obvious, so I'm sure we're in for a good surprise!"" And then when you finally think there is going to be that, ""Holy smokes, I didn't see that coming"" moment; the book ends..."
1,Very disapointing!,"This is a real shame - never before have I felt so let down by a book. I love SK and have read most of his books and really enjoyed them - but this was different - this was bad! The whole concept seemed so promising and from reading the blurb the book sounded as if it was going to be brilliant and for the first few chapters I thought the book was great and I really got into it. However, as the book continued I was left feeling confused, bored and wishing that SK was with me to explian the ending. The biggest let down ever and a waste of my time. I wont give up on SK though as he has written some amazing books but this sadly wasn't one of them. Sorry SK."
2,cheap thrills,"My God! The blurb reviews include ""Excellent prose"" and this should have been a warning. True, this is a well written novel but despite an initially engaging plot I soon realised that the gore and mutilation were just about the only substance to the plot. Once you become desensitised to the violence this book is a page turner only because you are desperately searching for some twist or expansion of character. No such luck. Don't try and second guess King, there's just no need."
2,"Sorry, I was disappointed","Sorry, I was disappointed in this book.Like most of Stephen King's books, the story started out well, but then it degenerated into a typical zombie novel."
5,"Well, on the minus side, I'm now terrified of my cell phone...","I've recently had a lot of free time on my hands, so I decided to pick up a few Stephen King novel, Cell being one of them.I couldn't put it down. I literally had to pace myself, so I wouldn't finish too quickly! This novel will grab you by your neck and shake the Bluetooth right out of your ear! My favorite Stephan King by far. I intend to read this again as soon as I can."
3,Just entertainment,"This book was easy to read and nothing that I had to tax my brain with. The book is not something that will keep me up at night and not one that I would tell anyone that they had to read. In saying all of that, it was still entertaining enough to make me finish but only something that one should pick up in a book exchange or a library sale that supports a cause."
4,Fun zombie escape story,"Zombie tales have been done so often, it is hard to find a new twist. King has done so. Sure, it draws from lots of familiar sources, or at least, seems to parallel some of them (I Am Legend had some similarities, certainly).But I like some of the new concepts, like the method the ""disease"" is transmitted. I like the intelligence of the zombies, or behind the zombies, as it were.And I can't help but wonder if the zombies had been successful in absorbing everyone.... were they on their way to a better society?Odd thoughts for a zombie story, but that's why I really enjoyed it, aside from King's regular ability to tell a great story."
4,A Must Read for Zombie Lovers,"I grabbed a copy of ""Cell"" as soon as it came out. The storyline was a five star for me, and I was insanely happy with the ""moments"" of humor thoughout the book. I loved the characters, their interaction with one another and I was throughly enjoying the ride.While I do believe this book to be a must read for zombie lovers; and liked the book in general, I was very disappointed in the ending. I felt as though I was left hanging. There was no real closure to the story, it just...stopped. I feel King could have done much better with even the slightest of effort.Love zombies? Read the book. Hate crappy, let down endings? Leave it on the shelf.King has done with this book what he did with the ending of the Dark Tower series... left us wanting, and somewhat enraged."
5,Awesome,"I haven't read a Stephen King book in a while, but I saw this sitting there, and I needed something to read. I was blown away. It only took me two nights to finish it. I won't ruin the story for you, but I will say that I couldn't put it down. From the first few pages, I was trapped. It wasn't just the usual hack and slash, Hollywood horror. Not what I expected at all. It was definitely not predictable either. Ever time I thought I knew what was coming, King threw another curve-ball and sent the story hurtling off in a new and shocking direction."
3,"A great read if you think ""The Stand"" is too long","It's a fast and gory read about the end of the world as we know it. It also veers a little into sci-fi territory--there's one section where a character references William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and even Greg Bear. I enjoyed it, but halfway through the book it started feeling more and more like an alternate universe version of ""The Stand,"" where Randall Flagg is replaced by The Raggedy Man, and the nuclear bomb is replaced by... well, never mind. It's a good summer book but not a classic. If you *haven't* read ""The Stand"" and enjoy ""Cell,"" you should definitely pick up the older, better-written title."
3,got to be honest...,"Well, as a great fan of King, I've waited a long time for this book's release, and ordered a hardcover copy as soon as it came out. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed, and that this book cannot be compared in any way to King's other masterpieces. I bought this book because I expected much and because I am a huge fan, but if you are not ""King-fanatics"", I would not recommend buying this book, his other books are SO much better."
3,not as good as I hoped,"Anyone who is a King fan will recognize the similarites to the Stand. The only difference is the use of cell phones, which will probably freak some people out. I was a little disappointed by this book, but if you are a true fan of King's it is nice to read anything by him."
1,"King, get real!","After reading books like The Stand, Misery, and The Shining, I must say this book was a complete joke. Sorry if I upset anyone, but if this is the best King can do, he should just enjoy the money he has already made and give this kind of nonsense up. Cell is an insult to anyone who has enjoyed the great works mentioned above.I gave it one star since there was nothing less."
2,Disappointing,"I was reading right along, enjoying the pacing and the story, when it suddenly just stopped. Is a sequel in store? Very disappointing way to treat a loyal reader."
3,"If you haven't read the book, don't read this review","I am a very big Stephen King fan and eagerly pick up every book he publishes. Ordinarily I am very satisfied by the end of the book, but not in this case. I agree with most people that there should have been a wrap-up chapter.... something, anything to answer the many questions. How did this all start? How many 'normies' were left? Was it a worldwide event? Did the 'save to system' work? Do our characters meet up again? I was getting nervous that there wasn't enough left to read as I was nearing the end and there were so many unknowns that I found myself distracted. I just kept hoping that there would be an epilogue-esque final page or something.I feel this was a book rushed to be published so that Mr. King could get some social commentary off of his chest."
2,Cell does not sell me.,"Although the novel begins on a strong, and typical King, note, it loses its tune as the plot progresses. The ending is anticlimatic after all the build up. And there are many unanswered questions, unlike The Stand, which had a similar apocalyptic plot. Who sent the pulse? Does the cell work on Johnny-Gee? King has a tremendous talent for creating real people and circumstances, which makes his horror elements so scary. Yet, there are characters we get to know very well in this novel that are lost to us without any explaination. I am a King fan, and wanted to love this latest work, but was left disappointed in the end."
3,Cell is a watered down version of The Stand,"Enjoyable light read but one can't help drawing parallels to The Stand. Basically it is The Stand but a Reader's Digest condensed version. Also, the ending is screechingly abrupt, as if King had to be somewhere in ten minutes and wanted it to be done. No conclusion at all. Not even a one paragraph epilogue. He suddenly wraps it up in about two pages and leaves, frankly, every story line hanging. Very odd.Also, why do these people spend day after day walking toward the conclusion? I understand the roads are congested but what about a motorcycle, a moped, or even a bicycle? If you were trying to save your son wouldn't you think you could cover a lot of ground much much faster with a bicycle? I mean sheesh."
3,The Stand for the 21st century,"Strong points for this book are pretty consistent action and an extremely high body count of the bad guys, the cell-phone zombies. That was appreciated.On the downside, like so much of King's recent stuff, it's only pretty good if it's one of the first books of his you've read, but annoyingly derivative of his other work for someone more than minimally knowledgeable of his oeuvre. Cell, for example, is derivative of The Stand, a better work.I wish King could keep his politics to himself, but apparently he can't. When he says things like ""I suggested Jenna [Bush] be waterboarded"" (Time, ""Q&A;: Talking With Stephen King,"" Nov. 23, 2007) he passes from the realm of author to just another left-wing BDS sufferer, making him not worth one more minute of my time or one more dollar from my wallet. Sometimes it's just too hard to separate the author from his politics."
3,There was no end.,"My title says it all. there was no offical end to this novel. Of course it was great and i especially like how the survivors were able to defeat the zombies or whatever they were. I could almost be mad becasue you don't even find out who started the pulse, why they did it, and you don't find out if The boy was going to be ok at the end. Stephen King is still one of my favorite writers but come on Stephen give me a break, leaving someone wanting more is one thing but when you have left out pretty much everything besides suspense then you have almost nothing there better be like a Cell 2 or something because there is no way you could consider that a story with an end. i give it 3 stars becasue he had great suspense at times but it was very draggy in some areas and once agin there is no ending it's just a bunch of unanswered questions that will only make you frustarted once your done reading it. Try again Stephen."
2,King Gives Up,"I promised myself a few years back that I wouldn't read another Stephen King novel for as long as I lived. After reading a few reviews of Cell by the author, however, I figured I'd give King another chance. Big mistake. In true Stephen King form of late, he grabs your attention in the first few chapters, builds up anxiety and expectation towards the middle of the book, then ends up dropping the ball at the end. He has gone from writing bad endings to not writing them at all. So very disappointing when you consider how great his early work was. I hereby reaver my promise to never read his work again and I think that's a shame because I truly considered myself to be one of his ""number one fans""."
3,"okay read, but nothing special","I am one of those people who has to read everything Stephen King writes, even though I'm often disappointed. I thoought the story in Cell was good, and it was a fast read, but I was once again disappointed in the lazy character/dialogue writing. If the speaker wasn't identified, it was impossible to tell who was talking, because all of the characters sounded exactly alike -- really, a fifteen year old girl and a middle aged man should not speak identically.I don't know about straight-on comparisons to The Stand, but I found it impossible to erase The Stand from my mind when I read Cell, for what that's worth, because so many scenes echoed or even mirrored scenes from The Stand. I'm sure I'll read his next book, but it will be from the library."
3,Typical King ending...,"Cell was an enjoyable and chilling read. There were many times that I couldn't put the book down. The problem with this book is that there are so many unanswered questions. At this point, it's tough to expect much of an ending from Stephen King, so as I read the book, I had the feeling that my questions never would be answered. That said, the book is written quite well, and it's easy to get into the story. Many parts were quite disturbing, and there was a great deal of suspense. Nowhere near King's best works, Cell is nonetheless worth a read, as it is not too long of a book and offers a semi-unique plotline. I've never been into Zombie movies or anything of the sort, and this particular book does incorporate a bit of the zombie flavor. It's alright here though."
1,What?,"I was very disappointed with this book. I can't tell you how much I had been looking forward to getting it, but what a let down. The story slams right into you in the first few pages and just raises more and more questions which are never answered or touched upon again. Pointless characters (Who was the Raggedy Man?) meet unlikeable characters (Alice). What was the point?It hurts me to say this because I ADORE Stephen King, but this book was just a waste of both his and my time."
4,Very Weird,This was a great book to read. But the end was just horrible. Its basically the worst cliffhanger I have ever read. The book ends so abdruptly I said to myself wtf.It never answers these questions : Who started the pulse? What happens to Clay's Son ? What happens too the Earth itself with a bunch of phone crazies runnning around.I realy hope there is a sequal because I need to no what the hell happened. I recomend it but u'll probably be very disapointed with the ending. Plz Mr. King Right a sequal !!!!!!!!!!
2,Not his best,"I don't understand how the same author can write really good books (likeThe Shawshanke Redemption and The Green Mile) and then some really awful ones like Dreamcatchers and Kingdom Hospital, to name a couple. This book isn't one of the absolute worst he has written but it is a far cry from being good. I was able to listen to the unabridged CD version which I got at the library. I hadn't read a good book in a long time, so it was passable to listen to this one. If I had just read a good book, I am sure I would not have been able to get past disc one. My advice is to get this at the library if you think you want to read it. it isn't worth buying."
2,Just not scary,"King's still a great writer, but I expected a horror novel, and what I got was an action/adventure zombie novel that just wasn't scary. No face-off at the end, no big showdown with a nemesis, just an anti-climatic ending."
3,"If you love King, read it","I finally finished ""The Cell"" this weekend, and at first I was incredibly ticked off at the (lack of) ending. I don't know what I expected; perhaps it was all the hype about this being the return of the ""old"" Stephen King. Well, it was and it wasn't. It was great fun and it had me drawn in from the first chapter. The action was King, the gore was King and the characters were King. But it wasn't long winded, it didn't take pages and pages to resolve sub-plots and it ended somewhat abruptly. (I know what I think happened, but I don't know what King think happened.) I decided to change my mind and count it as a good read, because of all those ""typically King"" elements that were present that I enjoyed in so many of his older novels. After all, I've been reading King for 25 years, and I'd like to think I've grown up - I think perhaps he has, too."
4,"Who, What?","I have loved SK since ""Carrie"". Although I've been disappointed with most of King's latest, Cell seemed to be a bit of a return to the King of yesteryear. Well, at first. It started off with a bang, then seemed to lose steam toward the end.The characterization is great, the plot a thrilling one. But I was disappointed, especially in the outcome. Too many issues are left dangling. Like who or what caused the Pulse? Terrorits? And why? Did it happen all over the world or in the US? And the ending was totally dissatisfactory. I won't give it away here but had the feeling King wrote it that way simply becuase he himself didn't have an answer.Is this the first of a sequel? I haven't seen anything stating that it is. I'd like to know what happens next.I give it 4 stars because it is a compelling read and one I didn't want to put down for the majority of the book."
3,Okay but central premise is kind of silly,"Stephen King has done a lot. Vampires--Salem's Lot. Haunted Hotel--The Shining. End of the World--The Stand. Aliens--The Dreamcatcher. And now with The Cell, he adds Zombies. I was kind of looking forward to this--given the recent Dawn of the Dead movie that was Stephen King-ish and quite good at both scaring me and making me laugh.The problem with the novel is that the first 75 or so pages features the raging zombies we are so used to. And then King takes the story in a different direction (give him points for originality), and the story gets rather silly--similar to that horrible Land of the Dead movie--remember the Zombies that got smarter. Didn't buy it then. Don't buy it here.The book's one saving grave is that King is such a skilled writer that the story is quite engaging and entertaining even if I didn't believe one bit of it. Still, I wished King would have stayed the traditional route and tried to scare the heck out of me."
3,King has gotten too weird for my taste.,"Cell is typical of King's writing since his accident. There is a good plot in the book and his character development is still amazing. The strange plot twists, however, just got too strange!"
4,King has grown up,"It has been quite a while since I've read anything by Stephen King, and then it was ""classic"" Stephen King, like Carrie, The Shining, Christine, etc. rather than his current work. I was really quite pleased with ""Cell."" It seemed like King has grown up and developed as an author, trying to do more than just give the usual gross outs that he's known for, and instead at least trying to say something. A fun read."
2,I love King but not this book,"The book opens with a bang, sets up some decent characters, and gradually he moves the plot (and as always some horiffic imagery). The problem is how it winds down to its finale, very uninspiring, it felt like he could not find an ending or a path to one. I'd say worse than Tommyknockers."
3,Wasted time.....,"I am a Stephen King fan, but this one will have to go to the bottom of the list of his books. I could hardly 'make' myself come back to this book to finish it. The dialogue is wacky, the ending leaves you going 'huh' and nothing really makes you 'excited' to be reading this book!! Sorry Stephen,,,this one won't be kept on my bookshelf!!"
4,Vintage Stephen King mixed with modern Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later,"I have read pretty much everything Stephen King has written. This book so reminds me of the early Stephen King, which were my absolute favorites. I was hooked after reading page 1, I could not put this book down. However, it read more like a movie - the action started immediately, there wasn't much character development and I absolutely hated the end. I did love the idea of the 'pulse' a completely new twist on the creation of a zombie.Everyone knows that the original Dawn of the Dead was symbolic of consumerism but is Stephen King also trying to echo this?"
2,I think it's an IMPOSTER AUTHOR!,"Like many of Stephen King's ""Constant Readers"" as he has dubbed us, I too have read everything (yes, yes, everything) that he has written.As I worked my way through Cell I kept waiting to be truly sucked in, to feel something for the characters and the outcomes... but it just continued to feel superficial.Then, a thought came to mind... this isn't actually Stephen King, it's somebody who's writing just like Stephen King (without the real hook, the real 'goods') and soon Stephen is going to pop out and say:""FAKE OUT""!""Just a hoax, another gimmick I'm trying to keep this whole writing business fresh and interesting""(oh please, oh please let that be true!)I don't really want to believe he would just coast through a book like this one. ""Phone it in"" as they say in the acting world.I won't give up on him, never, not ever. But if this is really you Stephen King, you can do oh so much better. And we, your Constant and Faithful Readers will be waiting. Always."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"Stephen King's version of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and all those re-writes of parodies of the original.That's about all that can be said of this waste of paper."
5,excellent novel,"This was an excellent novel, which captured your interest on the first page and kept it through the total story. Hopefully, there will be a sequel."
3,"not bad, but definately not King's best","The book was ok and good for a few hours of entertainment. It wasn't really shocking or scary and seemed to lack a lot of flair and dark/dry humor King often uses. If you read 'The Stand' before you read this book, you'll probably be disappointed."
2,Enjoyed it at the beginning...,"I'm a busy wife and mom. Having said that, when the opportunity to read a good book comes along, I take it! I was totally engrossed in this book at the beginning, squeezing in an hour here and there to read it. Little more than halfway through it started to become somewhat ""over the top"". King usually can make you believe that anything is possible but not so with this book. Too many unanswered questions (I know, maybe that's his goal...) and an ending that seemed to be written in haste. It almost seemed as though King lost interest in writing it and just packed it up and sent it off to his editor. Shame because it really had the potential to be an excellent read! Just left me feeling like I wasted a lot of my time getting to an ending that didn't actually exist."
2,Disappointing :(,"Accurately stated by ""azjudyann ""meteorologist wannabe"""", this is a very disappointing way to treat a dear loyal reader. Stephen King, I am a very big fan and I so wanted to love this book, but it never took off. As a loyal reader, I read to the end, but it just didn't get better. I am sorry for you and me. :("
3,wait till I read it,The book was made competently -- no missing pages as far as I could tell without actually reading it. Nothing to actually say about the story yet.
3,I can't believe there is NO ending!!!,"I really enjoyed the book right up until the last few pages..then all of a sudden it was over! It almost felt like there were pages missing, a whole chapter even...what gives?It is as if Stephen King was tired of writing this novel and just up and quit...I feel cheated and leery of reading another one of his novels..shame on him..."
2,I can't believe I spent the whole day reading this book,"I recently found myself wondering what to do with some overdue vacation time. Fond memories of Firestarter, Carrie and Nightshift compelled me to pick up Cell - reading a book seemed like the perfect way to disconnect from work. While it was an engaging read, much of it had similar references to The Stand. Finally after reading the last page of Cell I slammed the book shut and exclaimed ""I can't believe I spent the whole day reading this book - there's no closure!"" However, Cell was engaging enough so that I was able to disconnect from corporate America for a little while. I suppose this alone was worth the cost of the book."
1,Not very engaging,"I listen to a lot of audio books because I spend a lot of time in the car. I normally can't wait to get back into the car because I am listening to something good and I can't wait to hear what happens. However, this was not the case with ""The Cell"". I found this book dreadful. In fact, I didn't even make it to the end. The audio version was 13 hours long. I made it a little over half way and decided to give up. I knew what was happening and was following the story, but I just found it incredibly boring."
3,disappointed,"I am a real fan of Stephen King's work. I feel I have grown up with him. It seemed like ages since the last book and I was really looking forward to this one. But its a lazy book. Oft-repeated themes and failing to push any boundaries. Would be a decent read for anyone new to SK's work, but for Constant Readers its a disappointment."
2,Not Your Typical Zombie Tale,"I was hoping this book would be Stephen Kings epic Zombie Novel. Instead it is your typical Steven King book with weird characters and twist and turns. He seems to have a hard on for having a lone ""Bad Guy"" and this was kind of similar to The Stand in that way. To me that idea doesn't really work with a Zombie Apocalypse book but maybe I'm just hating. This book could have been a lot better."
2,Cell by Stephen King,I really thought this was lame compared to King's other books. Im starting to think he has lost the charm of his older books but the only other ones ive read ARE his older books. So just FYI.
5,Oh-so-good!!,"You could buy the whole seat, but you will only use the edge! Recomended to read in the day time...or come to think of it, the night time...you'll see. Can't put it down."
3,Stopped short,"I ordered the new Steven King novel ""Cell"" with great anticipation.I had read that this was King ""returning to form."" While I felt that this book is fast-paced and a true page turner, I was very disappointed at what I felt was the lack of a satisfying ending.The story just stops short at the end, without any kind of wrap-up regarding the state of things, or the disposition of the main characters. I cannot say more without spoiling the plot, but I really would have liked at least one more chapter to wrap up.That said, until the very end, this book was a thoroughly enjoyable read, and I could barely put it down."
3,Suspense but not Great,"I love Stephen King, but I haven't read any of his novels in a few years, I picked up Cell because a friend was reading it as well and the cover itself was Spooky. (Never judge a book by its cover). This book kept me up all night because Clayton Ridell, the main character was on a mission to figure out why people were suddenly turning crazy after picking up their cell phones. The reader clearly identifies with Clayton's need to reach out to his son Johnny -Gee and some scenes were very disgusting and gory, but thats classic King. I loved that part.The reason I gave this book three stars is because it was engaging from beginning to middle, but in the end...I kind of understood it, but it left me needing more, I craved more. I thought it was going to delve in a bit deeper about the son and the cell phone madness but it didn't so I am therefore upset with that."
1,FASPhoenix,"If you have read any of King's earlier novels, say twenty-five years ago, i.e. before his name was a household word, you would be convinced this is one such story. It opens well, by page 3 it has your attention; from then on, however, it bores the reader with 300+ pages of exactly more of the same stuff from page 5. Talk about redundancy and repetition! This novel barely earns a one star in my opinion."
2,Nothing really new here.,"OK, let me start by saying I am usually a HUGE Stephen King fan. I've read most of his books, and more then once. I enjoy his ""what if"" style, taking everyday things and situations and twisting them.But this book just didn't do it for me. It had too many echos of The Stand, one of my favorites. The end-of-the-world scenerio, the survivors being seperated, the misfit band trying to save the world.And I HATED the ending. Won't give it away, but hated it.This seemed to me to be too much in rough draft form."
4,great book,"Loved this story, very descriptive and kept me reading through the night. Made me want to through my cell away. I did not though, lol. You will enjoy this book."
2,good idea,it was a great idea for a book and i have thought of similar things with all our new electronics. But it did not really grab me. it was a good book and just that.
3,"Typical King -- good book, bad ending","I've read most of King's work, so I like the guy's work enough to keep coming back. But what is it about him that he has trouble writing a decent ending? This was a really gripping book but it fell flat toward the end. Still, it's worth reading."
2,I wish I could have used 2 1/2 stars,"This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half. The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writing was dead on as always and character development was good. This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book."
1,Worst King Novel Ever!,"I am a huge fan of any horror, thriller, psychological suspense genre books. I have read several of King's books and have been overly satisfied. But with this one, this one just took the cake as far as the worst book I have ever read! The book wasn't very progressive, but I kept reading, waiting for the next big thing to get the ball rolling as far as story telling. And in the end i was greatly disappointed. The ending of this book was by far the worst way to end it, with no answers and abrupt end. At the conclusion of reading it, I literally threw it as hard and as far as I possibly could (which also happened to be in the same direction of my husband). If King's purpose was to make you remember this story, he succeeded, because the book throwing story comes up quite often and if anyone asks for a recommendation for a book, I tell the to read anything on the planet except The Cell."
4,A good read with a clever plot,Although not one of his best novels this is still a genuine page turner.
3,Occasional King Reader,"I am occasional Stephen King reader and have enjoyed some of his earlier works. When ""Cell"" came out I thought I would try it. The first part of the book was a bit slow-going and was like reading the novel associated with some recent movies like ""Resident Evil:Apocalypse"". It wasn't until about mid-book that it became more interesting.The ending however was a complete cop-out. One of the worst endings to a book I've read."
2,King Phones It In....,"The first thing I did before writing this review was to go back a few hundred reviews to see if anyone else used my clever ""Phones It In"" tagline. I'm surprised nobody did, because it accurately describes this latest effort by one of my favorite authors ever.""Cell"" is a cross between Tommyknockers and The Stand, with the quality being much closer to the former than the later. For me, this novel harkened back to the bad old times before The Van Incident, when Mr. King's work had begun to slip noticeably. (Think of this as the ""Needful Things"" era.)Anyway, the story is very Tommyknockerish, and seems like it was written on autopilot. I LOVE Zombies and apocalyptic survivor stories, so I should have been pretty easy to please here. I think it was ""no-no fo-fo"" which pushed me over the edge. Yuk.Having said that, it is a pleasant enough read, and if you're like me, you HAVE to read it, so this review makes no difference."
1,Finished last night.....,"I nearly got all his books and I read even more of him. But this.....I don't know, I didn't read the other reviews, so I don't know if nobody else noticed it....Didn't it remember you partly of ""The Stand""? Sorry Mr. King, I really love your work, my favourite is The Stand and Bag of Bones, of course, Dreamcatcher also was great, there were some, which weren't that good, but ok. But this one???? A replay of The Stand, only in cell phones? I was sometimes really surprised how alike they are, nobody REALLY realized it???? If it was mentioned before, I do apologize, but if not....That was his first book, I really was disappointed of. Just like I said, replay of The Stand, only more recent....This book doesn't belong in the ""good"" category of Stephen King, not even near....."
3,Hello? Where's the ending?,"Stephen King just keeps cranking out book after book - a great many of which take place in the New England states. Cell starts in Boston and ends, somewhere between there and a dead cell phone signal area somewhere near - you guessed it - Maine.I liked most of this seeming ""mini-Stand"" novel but - like most others here - was unsatisfied with the ending. I wanted to read more about the root causes of the cell signal - aside from the terrorist theories. I wanted to know what happened with his son - or did Clay succumb to the signal in the very end.Overall King's Cell was a great weekend read. I'm not sure I would read a sequel to this book unless I've got a weekend to kill doing so."
2,Poor rehash of The Stand,"King is my favorite writer. I think The Stand, The Shining, The Green Mile, and Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption are classics.Cell does not compare to his better works. It is a lame rehash of the end-of-the-world survival theme done much better in The Stand.Reads like very lazy writing from one who usually works very hard."
3,King Recycles Again,"I've always been a fan of Mr. King, however in the last few years it's felt less and less like he's even trying to be original or creative. Cell is OK, but it's really just a knock-off or the brilliant British horror film ""28 Days Later"", with a touch of his own ""Tommyknockers"" novel thrown in. It's a fast read and unfortunately, you'll forget it even faster."
3,BIG BOLD LETTERS.,SYSTEM FAILURE! SAVE TO SYSTEM! REBOOT!(...)SYSTEM FAILURE! SAVE TO SYSTEM! REBOOT!(...)SYSTEM FAILURE! SAVE TO SYSTEM! REBOOT!(...)If you keep on doing the same things and expect to get different results; then you are definately crazy.
2,don't waste your time,"Horrible read. i'm a huge stephen king fan, have read and enjoyed over 20 of his books and really only hated one of them. Unfortunetley, now it's two. The character development, backstory, and plotline which epitomize king's books were almost non-exsistant. I thought more than once while reading that he simply paid some twelve year old to come up with the story, it was that ridiculus. The entire novel was anticlimatic and i think you'll enjoy throwing the book against the wall more than reading it."
2,should've been a novelette,"I am not a fan of Stephen King's novels,but I do really enjoy his short stories and novelettes.I think ""The Mist"" was probably his best.That is the problem with Cell-it would have been much better as a novelette-the premise was very original and the beginning was an instant attention-grabber-very scary and compelling with potently drawn images-then after a certain point the novel becomes repetitive and the characterizations don't hold sustained interest.King has tried to pump up a story into a novel and in the process has weakened a very interesting concept."
3,"Original, but unfinished","I personaly liked the gunslinger books, the Dark Tower series, and this is not my personal type of genre; ""Cell"", the horror is classic King style, but the story is unresolved. I think this story is not epic, but incomplete. When reading it though I see potential for a sequel that will probably satisfy the other readers and myself. If one desires to read something truly original I recommend ""Between Shadow & Light."""
2,king?,"The book has an interesting premise but that's all. After the first chapter you get to take a walk with the main character & friends but nothing really interesting happens, no explations for what happened, how and why are given. The end let's you thinking that someone forgot to add a few chapters.Disappointing to say the least"
2,What a disappointment.,"I'm a fan of King, but this one is definitely not up to his usual caliber of story telling. Too bad."
2,Not,"Bloody and boring. It's like Night of the Living Dead meets Harry Potter. There was gore almost throughout the whole thing to the end - if you can call it an end. A ""whatever"" end - maybe this, maybe that - ""whatever"". As if the author didn't know how to end it. Does the book publisher have him under contract to churn out a book no matter how good or bad? Anyway, King remains my favorite author."
4,The Zombies are back!,"After reading ""Brokeback Mountain"" (which is good!) I was ready for something fun and and Mr. King did not let me down! Don't get me wrong, this is not the great American novel, but it is not supposed to be. Its meant to scare you and make you laugh at the same time. It is a take off on the old zombie pics by George A. Romero. Yes the story is not really original. In some ways it is a rehash of the ""The Stand"" but King is successful in taking the apocalyptic zombie tale and making it horrifyingly fun! The cult Classic of 2006!"
4,Another Absorbing Tale by King,"As always, Stephen King brings to life a colorful cast of characters and immerses you in a setting so rich, you'll swear you were there. This and his gift for storytelling are what make me return to his books. That being said, ""Cell"" wasn't my favorite. It certainly kept my attention, and I eagerly turned the pages, but I'm not a huge fan of apocalyptic stories. I prefer more classic King horror. Unfortunately, the end was unsatisfying--left too much unanswered. But overall a solid read. Most King fans will enjoy it."
5,Cell by Stephen King,An other great book from one of the masters. Love it and it was hard to put down to get some work done. Readers will not be disappointed with this book.
1,Absolutely AWFUL.... Worst King to date,"Stephen King takes a great premise for a novel, starts out with a great first ten pages of reading and then crashes, and burns !! His characters are two dimesional and entirely unlikeable; his ending is not only abrupt, but doesnt answer any questions or provide any satisfying closure to where the characters went after the credits rolled. As usual, his writing is excessively and unneedingly verbose (but that is Stephen King)This novel is VERY unsatisfying and one of the worst King has written. Stay away from this novel. It is a huge waste of time."
4,Good Story,"I enjoyed Stephen King's latest Novel ""Cell."" He served up a dish of graphic mental images and fast paced story telling. What can I say, I was entertained. Loved the book dedication toGeorge A Romero...perhaps he could direct a screenplay adapted from ""Cell""? Something to think about."
1,A disappointed King fan...,"this book feels like King has lost his magic touch for fear..........undeveloped characters, unanswered questions, and just too many holes in the plot. I have read more King than I can recall, but this is, perhaps, the biggest let down I have ever experienced. I plodded through just to finish....I had read the reviews and saw a good number of them expressing disappointment; I wish I had listened. The ending is so dull, that it almost feels like King was bored. King seemed to have trouble holdig back on his personal politics in this one."
2,Cell,"If you are a Stephen King reader and recent novels haven't impressed you, well don't get your hopes up. Cell doesn't offer what you would expect from a great writer. The story line is about terrorists who find ways to use our cell phones to their advantage that could ruin a whole population. Clayton Riddle is in Boston agreeing to a comic book deal when the devastating strike happens. Not reacting to answer his phone; Clayton doesn't realize that everybody's life would be soon changing."
1,Must have been for the money.,"Slow, boring and another example of a great writer, who doesn't know when to stop."
1,By Stephen King?,"Stephen King to me is a genius - whoever wrote this book is not! Any serious reader of his amazing work should know that he could not have penned this book. If he's sick or his capabilities are diminished (please, no!) tell us, be honest please. Don't try and float something like The Cell."
1,IT'S ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE......,"Stephen King came out of retirement and wrote a much shorter version of THE STAND, DESPERATION,and other previous novels all combined. I loved SALEM'S LOT, DESPERATION and many others.Mr. King is not a classic author, but he does write good horror and in his early books - awesome suspense.This book has much gore, which is fine by me, but it is not scary and has no suspense. It starts full force on page one and the main characters are flat and one-dimensional. I just didn't care. A huge yawn. It reads like it has a great purpose and says nothing.I had to put it down before finishing for I had to force myself to read this one and I grabbed a book worth reading."
4,Steve does it again,"It is good to see Steve King back in form. After IT, Steve kinda slipped, in my estamation, but he has made a great come back with CELL."
4,Great book,"I loved this book. I loved the idea of a ""pulse"", because who knows if it is plausible? A very scary thought! I also liked that we never knew who was behind the whole thing and that is terrifying. I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down. The ending was a let down, though. I thought I was missing the rest of the book."
4,"Stephen King, Cell....yeah! he's back!!!!","It looks as though our guy ""Stephen"" is back with us again. This novel is an easy read. The premis gives one pause to think...""could this REALLY happen????"". I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to all KING fans."
1,Yawn - sob,"If you'ld like to be bored and depressed all at the same time, then you've come to the right place. The only horror I found in this book was that I was stuck reading it. I love a good horror novel, one that keeps you on the edge of your seat - this just kept me with a tissue in hand and hoping to finally get to the end. Stephen, good idea - bad story telling. This for sure isn't ""Dawn of the Dead"" but more like ""Dawn of the Dread"". Oh, and shame on them for leaving Rafe."
2,cellular defect,"The title of this Stephen King novel is a conflation of ""cell phone"", ""brain cell"", and ""terrorist cell"".King's zombie tale seems to be an allegorical presentation of a particularly mindless interpretation of terrorism. The cell-phone zombies represent modern society run amok. Unprovoked atrocity is the only response that occurs to the remaining ""normies"". But that's ok, because the programming that coordinates the zombies is decaying anyway.Aside from the political subtext, the problem with this book is that it is dull. Tons of gore, but no danger. Characters that are less lively than their zombie counterparts.I love Stephen King. But this book is just a disappointment, even worse than his latest few. It's as if the man stopped writing after the crash and turned his name over to a syndicate."
3,CELL very disappointing,"This is really a good book until the end. It is scary and King does a great job at describing the chaos around. I hate Stephen King for sucking you in to a good story only to have the ending just slopped/slapped on. I read a few of his other books that do the same, I should have learned my lesson then. BUT NOOOOOOOO! So if you like Zombie type stories (there is more to it then that) it is a good story but the ending is very disappointing!! This time the story surrounds a guy, accompanied by a handful of survivors, who's looking for his son amid a bunch of cell phone brain-washed zombies. I hope his short stories are better since I am starting Everything's Eventual."
1,not good,"I like Stephen King, but the last 200 pages were bad, bad and boring. Then the end was even worse. Other than that, a pretty good read."
1,Just plain bad,"It's hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as Carrie, Pet Sematary, and The Shining. I am at a loss for adjectives which describe this sophomoric collection of words. Suffice it to say, the large quantity of unfavorable reviews posted here describe most of my thoughts. I don't believe it when Stephen King claims he does not own a cell phone. I think he did, he turned it on, made a call, and his brain got zapped. Then he wrote this book."
1,Cell Is A No Sale,"This is one mess of a novel.WARNING: The first couple of chapters are exciting, bizarre, and at times sad (e.g. Tom McCourt and his cat Rafe) but after that it is a speedy trip downhill into boredom.The deranged victims of their cell phones pretty much do nothing throughout the book but lay out in the sun, eat cakes and candies and listen to muzak, easy-listening and soft rock (I am not kidding you with any of this!)."
5,a book that might have you fearing your own cell phone,"When I first starded this book I wasn't sure that I was going to enjoy it because it was a little gory at first.And does so through out the book.But it griped me after awhile.And I couldn't put the thing down.But hey,thats Stephen king for you"
2,"A great premise, but...","First of all, I love the premise of this novel to death - a mysterious ""pulse"" sent via cell phones turns listeners into crazed, zombie-like killers. Unfortunately, after a great set-up with the main character describing the chaos that breaks out around him as people with cell phones go bonkers, the story quickly turns to rote Stephen King story-telling. I'm talking about vivid dreams that - suprise, surprise - reveal a future plot development, cross-country treks through a ruined society by a motley assortment of lucky survivors, impossible coincidences, and, worst of all, floating, telepathic ""zombies."" The story just turned so damn silly at the end that I was anxioulsy waiting its conclusion.This seems like the sort of story King can write in his sleep. It's strictly by-the-numbers here, folks."
3,WARNING.....Don't use your cell phone for calls.....SEND A TEXT INSTEAD!,"I quite enjoyed this novel from Stephen King and even though it isn't my favourite king novel I'd say it keeps you reading on enthusiastically. If you don't fancy paying for the hardcover, wait for the paperback as it's soon to be released."
3,"Scary, Creative -- too bad the ending stinks","I've been dying to read this book since I read the first 2 chapters online before it came out. It didn't disappoint in that it was fun brain candy to read in a day's immersion as most of my reads with Stephen King and Dean Koontz.A creative and frightening concept, especially for those of us NOT addicted to cell phones, only using them for emergencies.But after spending so much time reading, I was frustrated enough with the ending to toss the book across the room. Not satisfying at all. Enough open-ended questions that it feels as if several chapters are missing or Mr. King just ran out of steam to finish another huge novel. I don't mind up-in-the-air endings, but this one left me very annoyed and irritated.Still, a worthy read if you're a King fan."
3,Mediocre,Sadly King's ability to spin out the twists and turns of a taleeluded him on this occasion.The novel starts well enough but then becomes heavy work.A great idea/concept for the story is let down by the tale having poor characterization and a disappointing ending.Hopefully his next novel will prove a return to form.
3,A good ride that could have been better,"I started reading Stephen King in the 70's beginning with Salem's Lot. Like many of his fans I believe he did his best work in The Stand but also enjoyed Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, and The Green Mile. Cell was a fun book to read but lacked the character development, intriguing plot, and richness of language that is present in some of his other works. I might have gone a star higher if there would have been an Epilogue included in the book - there were just too many unanswered questions with no closure.Overall it was good read and I'm still a fan. I'm looking forward to his next adventure."
4,Return (To Form) of the King...at least somewhat..,"The last King novel I'd read was 'Dreamcatcher'...the rancid stench lasted until now. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Cell', though there were sections I could've sworn I'd read before in earlier King novels. After twenty some odd novels, I guess there isn't any way not to regurgitate past material somewhat. Still, for the most part, a really good read with some great, old-fashioned King scares and gore. I'll say this, it beat the hell out of 'Insomnia' and 'Dreamcatcher'."
3,The Stand Meets Cell Phone,"Like a few other reviewers here, I thought the book started out like ""The Stand"".Now, that would have been a good thing, except it didnt develop well. I found the idea of the book exciting, but it left me flat in the end. Too many unanswered questions.The book just ended.What made it even more upsetting was the extra pages at the end of the book that was an excerpt from an upcoming book. That made one think that there were more pages left to the novel (im not one of those look at the end of the book people until I get there).All in all, it was an entertaning read but not Mr. King's normal thought provoking, interesting character novel."
2,major disapointment,"I was looking forward to a return to king's horror roots.I'm a life-long stephen king fan, but I think his best work is now behind him. this is definitely not up to his usual high standards. in my youth a new king book was an event. I remember the excitement I felt when I read the stand, the shining, and salem's lot for the first time. however I'm afraid those days are over. this book seemed rushed, with no explanation for the ""pulse"", weak characterization, another one hundred pages or more were needed. the best horror today is being written by edward lee. go check him out."
2,"Unused Potential, Generally Disappointing","To be honest, I borrowed this from the library instead of buying it because I was skeptical - cellphones make people zombies. Okay, it could be made interesting. And there was potential there to do so; midway through it seems like there could be something big, sinister, The Stand-ish. It seems that one character could have done a lot more to make it difficult for the protagonists, and doesn't. But that potential wasn't taken.On further reflection, the concept, albeit with computers and logging-in to the Internet (instead of cell phones,) was done in Snow Crash years ago."
2,"Been there, done that","A fan of King's earlier horror stories, much of his recent work has failed to engage me. I couldn't finish either Tom Gordon or Dreamcatchers - they didn't grab me like Carrie or The Shining or Christine or Night Shift.That being said, I felt like Cell relied on plot devices and themes King's done well before, but now just come across as tired and cliched. This was a great premise - the potential to terrorize with cell phones - that just wasn't realized to its potential. I kept waiting for the big payoff, buy it never came.Conside this short review your caller ID, and don't bother picking this one up."
3,Can you hear me now?,"A mind altering signal called ""the pulse"" is sent through cell phones causing anyone that hears it to turn into a mindless zombie. A small group of cheapskates that don't own cell phones are left to a world of chaos as they try to avoid the zombies and find family members.This was a good read, but the ending was disappointing. Without giving too much of the story away, let me just say that the story is not resolved at the end. A man named Clay is looking for his nine year old son to save him from the zombies called ""phoners"" or re-program him if he has been turned into one. Unfortunately, the reader never finds out if the father saves the son because this is where the book ends.Without resolution of the story, what is the point?"
1,Horrible,Mr. King takes a great idea for a story and makes his characters act like idiots to ruin it all. No one would laugh and make jokes during such a horrific situation. It's just ridiculous.
2,Where is the rest of it?,"The story was interesting. Even though I was assaulted by the ""F"" word from every character, which is just uncalled for, (Does he seriously believe that every person in the world talks like that?), I was still intrigued to find out what was going to happen. How did they get out of this predicament? Would the world ever be the same again? What happens to the main characters? Well, don't ask me! You will arrive at the end of the book and STILL have all these questions unanswered! A waste of time."
4,Amazing...Pure Stephen King,Very good read. Very easy read. King incorporates his well known psychological struggles to terrify the reader even more. Very well written. Been a king fan for years and would definitely suggest it. Ending could be better...nothing gets answered...but still very good.
4,Good King,"Stephen King's novels always seem to be hit or miss to me. Some of them I enjoy, others I could do without. Cell is one of those that really pulls you in from the very beginning. Maybe not one of King's best, but a very interesting read."
1,A complete waste of time,If you have a lot of time on your hands and you want to be bored for a few hours go ahead and read Cell. I hate to admit that I did actually finish the book (although I did skip pages since nothing was happening) but I was curious to see how King would end the story. Then after hours of boredom I discover that King couldn't come up with an ending.
5,Book: $16 and change. Time: 3 hrs. Getting spooked in broad daylight? Priceless!,"After reading it in one sitting, I went to use my cell phone and got a shiver when I did.Getting creeped out in broad daylight? Awesome!Hasn't happened to me since Cujo and 'Salem's Lot.Loved the indeterminate ending, too. Life's not black and white (or at least, it shouldn't ever be so easy) so the ultimate outcome is unknown.He's baaaacccckkkkkk!"
3,Good But Not Great,"King is always good and sometimes he's great (e.g., Green Mile, The Stand). This time out, he's merely good. Quick read with great character depth but it never really rose above a standard thriller. While some disliked the ""lack of an ending,"" I had no problem with it. I thought it was fitting. Not a place to start for someone new to King -- since it's King Lite -- but it's a nice way for a fan to pass the time."
3,Good Read!,"The new book isn't up to the depth I came to expect of Stephen King. While it does not have the jaw dropping Awe of some of his more famous works, it certainly does have patent King qualities to it. The characters are a bit flat compared to Kings usual superb character development, but they are still memorable characters. This book takes the feel of a Movie more then a fictional literature due to it's fast pace, and outward story focus. Fans that are rating this book so ungenerously are doing so a bit hastily and immaturely. It is not his best work, but it certainly is worth the read! After all Stephen King is an entertainment writer, and this book does entertain. You may not think of your cell phone the same way again, and if a piece of writing can stick with you like that... he did his job quite well."
1,Don't Give Up Retirement!,"Unfortunately the great King is allowed a couple of duds. I just wish I knew before I spent my money. I'm a long time King fan and I found The Cell a tad tedious and full of air. This story could've been written as a short story. I find it annoying when writers depend on current trends to capitalize the ""what if"" theory. Also angering is the premise of his new book (printed as hand written copy!) Thanks for the sneak peek, I know now not to pluck money down. Good luck!!!!!"
2,and then it just.......... stopped.....,"To me, this was a pretty good read- not as engaging as the SK books that really let the reader get to know the people and care about them- but a decent ripping yarn........... and then it just ...stopped... I turned pages, looking for the next chapter- there was a promo excerpt from a forthcoming book (hopefully a WHOLE one), but no next chapter. Did the publisher screw up (""oh, terribly sorry, please save your store receipt as your voucher for the last 200 pages""). Kind of a rip."
2,"Hit the spot, but STILL....","I wanted to read this book because I needed a break from the more thought-provoking fare I have been reading lately. I wanted something gory, an easy read, not very intellectual, and I got it in Cell. I used to love King - for a while there, I read everything he put out, so I speak with a little of background knowledge. Cell definitely has its moments of suspense and I caught glimpses of the stuff that used to make me breathless with anticipation...but overall, it falls flat. Totally flat in my opinion. And the ending?? What in the world is that about? It seemed to me that he got tired of writing and just ended it! Very disappointing."
3,A rush job to the publisher?,"The idea of the novel held promise, but Mr. King failed to develop the characters as fully as he does in most of his stories. I feel that he must have been trying to beat a publishers' deadline, while in the meantime working on Lisey's Story. The depth of character development and the strong imagery to which we are accustomed did not come through. After recently completing the seven part Dark Tower series, completely enthralled throughout, we know that Mr. King is capable of better. I have purchased Lisey's Story and am looking forward to reading it."
3,I'd have given it five stars if ...,"Spoiler follows. Although I don't think it's much of a spoiler, since many other reviewers have said basically the same thing. I have a problem with an experienced writer who crafts a solidly suspenseful book where I am really rooting for the hero, and the ending is as ambiguous as this one was. I used to think, ""Well, life is ambiguous, after all."" Now I'm older, I've read a lot more books, MOST OF WHICH HAVE ACTUAL ENDINGS, and I think it's just lazy writing, as if Mr. King knew all along that if he became too weary to think up any more plotlines, he'd have an out. It's really along the lines of, ""And then they all got hit by a bus."" I'm not impressed."
3,What happened?,"I checked this book out of the library and read it in three days. It was terribly exciting and had all the elements of a great end of the world/horror book. However, the last third of the book stumbles on itself. I had so many questions, most notably, ""Who released the Pulse?"" To my chagrin, this question is never answered and after the final sentence, I found myself flipping back through the book to compare dates. I still don't know what the date on the final page means, following the inevitable (and so annoying) cliff-hanger of an ending. Perhaps King was already writing his next bestseller and had to draw Cell to a close. I know I was expecting more....still, until this point it was a fabulous and I was a rapt reader."
2,Not fit for a King...,"Maybe Stephen King has outdone himself so many times that we, the reader, have come to expect him to top himself each and every time. BUT, maybe it's impossible to top or equal your best work each and every time and Stephen King has proven that here.Cell:A Novel was boring, for me. Very predictable to the point that I started to think that the predictability was a ploy to trick the reader and the surprise was right around the corner. It never came.I'll always be a Stephen King fan and I've already forgiven him for this one. Re-read a classic King and pray his next tome will be back to his frightful best..."
2,Too dis-ingenuous!,"What a convoluted story. Every character is twisted, why? The first couple of chapters are great and the premise is good, so why do I only rate this book 2 stars? It all goes cuckoo half-way through the book, it is almost as if the author stopped and said ""wait a minute, why would I want the story to have an honest ending""? ... Steven King has Jumped the Shark, and, it is hard to believe that he even wrote this book."
3,Was Just Okay for Me,"I was a huge fan of King up to the time of Misery and It. After those novels, I felt that his novels didn't reach the heights of old. Lately I haven't liked them much at all. This novel is a bit of a turnaround for King. The action is fast and furious from the first pages on. Plenty of gore and pseudo-zombies. Despite all this, I still wasn't blown away by the tale like I thought I would be. If you have remained a King fan all these years, then this is probably a quick terrific read for you. As a fan who has moved on a bit, this novel isn't enough to bring me back to the fold."
2,Big disappointment,"I don't want to regurgitate what others have said except to say that King phoned this one in (pun intended). It starts off promising but winds down to a snails pace, to becoming downright silly in later pages. There is nary a sense of menace after the first 70 or 80 pages. What a drag. I am an avid King fan and this could have been good. Sad."
3,Not King at his best...,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan but felt a bit deflated by this latest novel (especially after such a long wait).Although it's by no means a turkey it's also a long way from King at his very best.The idea was fantastic in theory and to be fair the book did begin well before running out of steam towards the end, culminating in a conclusion that was quite poor.As some of the other reviewers have already stated you do get feelings of deju-vu as a lot of the text reads too much like some of his previous novels:-The Stand in particular.Hopefully his next book will herald a return to form?"
2,Don't Waste Your Time and Money on This Book,"I was compelled to buy this audio book because I felt the topic was a great idea, which turned out to be true, despite what I heard about the book's terrible, incomplete ending. It starts out action packed and seems as though it will turn out to be very exciting throughout. As the story progressess, however, the zombies become rather non threatening and boring. The book, was overall boring, uninteresting, and sloppily and lazily written. The ending, if you can even call it that, was horrible, and the final chapters of the book were extremely boring and seemed to drag on forever. The ending was as if you were reading a book that had the last several chapters left out. I could have written a better ending than King did, having never written a book. The boring, incomplete ending is like torture and ruins the entire story. I highly recommend not wasting your time and money on this book."
2,"A recycled ""the Stand"" without the great ending","Put this book down and go buy the Stand by Stephen King it is a similar story but much better than Cell. This book started interesting but never told us how the cell virus worked, who did it and why. The plot was similar to the The Stand which made me feel like I was being ripped off by King. The following is my prediction of the plots for Kings next two books: 1. An outcast high school girl who has psychic kinetic powers reeks havoc at her prom dance. 2. A troubled family becomes care takers of a summer resort during the winter only to find out that the resort is haunted. The father goes into a murderous rage. Recycling is a good thing for plastic but not for novels.Jon Schneider"
4,This is why I fell in love with Stephen King novels....,"...when I was 14 years old. I had the same thrill reading Cell that I had when I picked up my first Stephen King novel Salem's Lot. It's this type of suspense and page turning excitement that has made King famous.Cell is a great ride with good character development and just the right amount of detail. You know it's a good book when you don't want it to end and want to know more about the characters. I agree with a previous review about doing a sequel. I would love to read about the fallout from the pulse. Please don't leave us hanging, Stephen!"
3,"Ok book, but expected better from S. King","Don't set your expectations to high and you won't be disappointed. The beginning lacked King's full character development, I didn't feel like I was sucked into any character's head right away like many of his other books. I can't fault him for wanting to try a slightly different approach, but character development is one of King's strong(est) skills. He did create more of a fast paced action in the beginning than he normally does, usually you slip into his stories with a certain dread through his foreshadowing. I have to admit there were a few little scary parts while I read this in the middle of the night, but zombies always bother me in the middle of the night. I didn't feel like this story didn't have a proper ending, like some people, it ended ok. But I never really felt that close to any of these characters, once and awhile I would feel some attachment but not like his other books. Worth a read if you like zombies."
2,Even the King is allowed a dud once in a while...,"When you pick up a King novel you expect great things. Great story, deep characters, excellent dialoge, some (or alot) of scary scenes. None of this happened for me with Cell. This has to be the very worst book of King I've ever read. Sure not all his novels are great but none have been bad like this. It was a forced read all the way through. Dialoge was mediocre at best. The characters weren't anything special. But the element that really put this book at the bottom of the zombie pile was the poor story. Don't bother with this one. Not scary, not entertaining, not interesting. Sorry Mr. King."
2,grrr,I liked this book. I hated the ending or lack there of I should say. I never read a crappier ending. All the suspense and then....nothing! Grrr I'm waiting for the sequel.
2,Left disappointed,"This book started out with a great bang, but it sputtered about halfway through. There were a number of elements from ""The Stand"" here--too many elements, and I should know, I've read ""The Stand"" cover-to-cover about four times. But unlike ""The Stand,"" too many details and explanations are simply dismissed.SPOILERS AHEAD:In addition to the inconclusive, cliff-hanger ending, there is never an explanation about the origin of The Pulse. There is a side reference to unnamed terrorists possibly being responsible, but nothing else. Too much credence is given to the characters' dreams. I was able to accept that in ""The Stand,"" but in ""Cell,"" it seemed the dreams were simply a way to advance the plot.At the end of the book I felt like I was hung up on."
3,Not my favorite king story,"The book is violent with graphic details of murder and mayhem. King drops the F bomb in here quite liberally it seems to me. A major character for whom you develop a great deal of sympathy dies, and I think her death was entirely unnecessary. It did nothing but detract from the story as far as I'm concerned.The overarching theme of this book almost seems to be that we need to beware of our increasing dependence on technology and how easy it would be for the right group of people to somehow forever alter our world through the very technology we've come to think of as harmless and indeed helpful.Would I read this again? Well, perhaps. It was well written in so many regards, and King's ability to horrify and tell a gripping story is well known to us all. This wasn't my favorite King book, but it's certainly understandable how it can be a bestseller."
3,Decent read,Good story line with interesting character development. The ending is very unsatisfying with major issues unresolved. There is a lot of potential for a great closing but dissappointing as is.
3,Nice To Have Him Back!,"Granted Cell isn't one of the better King novels but considering his talk of retirement had me thinking I might never get another book from him again, heck, I'm glad to have Cell and no complaint about it shall pass my keyboard! The plot here, an intentional tip o' the hat to George Romero's zombie flicks, also somehow reminded me slightly of the 1990's sequel to Rosemary's Baby, with its apocalyptic ploy to destroy mankind with its own technology addiction. King has used cell phones as a plot device in books before this (Desperation, etc.) but never to such gory effect. (Heck, no one has used these harmless little communicators we all suddenly own in this way!) Cell is not, as I said, King in top form, but he does deliver a novel worth the money. The story here is fast, gruesome, keeps you reading to the end, and it gives hope that this great master storyteller is back in the saddle again. What could be bad about that?"
2,WTF?,"I finished this book and now I'm sorry I did. I was so curious as to who was behind the pulse, what was going on in other parts of the world, was it only local? None of these questions was answered. We are left with a small group of people in New England cut off from the world. But why did the readers have to be cut off too?Very unsatisfying and the ending was terrible. I actually went back and forth between the last page and the one that followed thinking a page might have dropped out of my book."
2,garbage,I've read dozens of Stephen King's books over the last 25 years. Needless to say I've enjoyed most of them or I wouldn't keep coming back for more. This last effort has got me shaking my head. It has got to be one of the worst books that I have ever read from start to finish. After an interesting beginning reading this crap became hard work. At 10:15 tomorrow I'm going to leave this book on top of the nearest gabage can at the corner of Queen Anne and Mercer in Seattle. So if you want a free (terrible) book you can have it.
3,What Happened?,This book started off great. I couldn't put it down. Then in the end it just ended. I never found out what happened to everyone and why. Is this how Stephen King novel's are? Does he like to keep you guessing?
2,King's 'Cell' A Great Disappointment,"Stephen King's new book 'Cell' was a great disappointment to me. I enjoyed his early writing a great deal. It was researched, witty, poetic, disturbing and captivating. This novel is pedantic, cliche, politically biased, socially skewed and patently ridiculous in its premise. Give me Dean Koontz any day - an author who has a wide range of plots and doesn't drag his bitterness and ideologies into his writing as King has done here. The Stand is still, in my mind, one of the greatest books ever written - what a pity that King has bought more into Hollywood hype and drivel than into what people actually think and feel in the majority out there. Not to be unkind, but I highly doubt, given an apocolypse, that people would be as weak as his characters in 'Cell' are. Save your money for the next Koontz novel unless you like a novel that bashes our President, our government, the Iraq war, right to life, non-alternative lifestyles and moral living that is."
2,"Boring, Suspenseless","My old UMO classmate has lost his fastball. Little suspense, grown men kissing young boys & calling them ""honey""? repettitive dialogue reminiscent of Harry Turtledove. Brilliant horrormeister suffers a temporary (I hope) setback."
1,I Missed Rafe The Cat Too,"I agree, Tom didn't need to leave him behind. He could have placed him in a secure knapsack.It wasn't as if they actually needed to outrun the 'phoners' anyways, since most of the tiime the zonked out creatures spent lying out in the sun listening to soft rock or munching on Twinkies!"
2,As energetic as a zombie's shuffle,"I dig zombie flicks. The claustrophobia, the apocalyptic end of the the world hugeness, the flight from a ravenous cannibalistic mob and the perpetual need to hole up somewhere safe. This book just glanced those themes and the ""zombies"" (actually just brain addled living humans) themselves turn out to be telepathic? I give credit to King for creating HIS own world of a ""zombified"" apocalypse but it reminded way too much of The Stand. But it wasn't a true zombie novel. The pacing was a little jerky and the characters themselves didn't really portray real human reactions to a horrific catastrophe. I wanted to be scared. I was distracted. I heard they were going to make a movie out of this already so my opinion would be to ""wait for the movie""."
3,Great Beginning. Slow Middle. No End.,"I was a little disappointed in this zombie novel from the master of horror, Stephen King. The beginning was great. Lots of mayhem and gore, although I felt that the main character figured out the mystery of how it all happened a little too quickly. After the initial mayhem, however, the story slows down severely. It plods along as the characters make their way north for hundreds of pages. Then finally it gets interesting again when the Ragged Man shows up. After that it is fairly interesting. Then we come to the end, if you can call it that. One page you're reading along, then the next, THE END.I was not really satisfied with this book. The writing was nice, but there were too many flaws and not enough story for the length of the book."
2,Lame ending,"The story in this book was good, but I had a really hard time dealing with the fact that cell phones were to the weapon. It was just a little too far fetched and weird for me. I would have enjoyed it much more had it been the same story line with a different cause! I guess I always wish for something much more exciting from what is/was what I thought such an amazing author."
2,Pathetic novel !,I seriously doubt that I will read another Stephen King novel. I read half of Duma Key and stopped reading it due to boredom. I read all of Cell and was very dissapointed regarding the conclusion of the story. It's like he decided to stop writing due to boredom to. I just don't understand what all the hoop-la is about this author. Don't waste your time reading this nonsense.
3,"A bit pleased, partly disappointed.","This book ended up leaving me a bit disappointed. I thought that it started out great - reminded me of ""The Stand"". (My favorite SK book.) Halfway through, I started to lose interest. (Around the time that they leave the Acadamy) I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that the characters seemed flat. I'm actually quite shocked at how little SK developed these characters into interesting personalities.Towards the end, I felt that SK rushed to finish it. Things came together too easily, and with little explanation. I actually started to not care how it ended - I just wanted it to be over.SK has written some fantastic books: The Stand, Misery, Bag of Bones, Gerald's Game, etc. I never get upset when one slips through that doesn't meet my expectations, as I know that for every one that I don't like, there's three more that I do."
3,Not exactly Hemingway!,"If this book was a movie, it would definetely be a lowbudget horror b-movie.I am not going to bore you with a plot summary, but just say that this a entertaining read that will leave most readers pleased at the end. The first half is the best, where we see the whole modern world break down. The characters are believable, and the plot is ok, though we never really get explained what actually happened, but its actually nice to be kept a bit in the dark about the background for the ""pulse"".This is not king's best book, not even close, but its a lot better than most of what he churned out during the nineties. Its a book to be read on the bus, or at home on a rainy day, when you've got nothing else to do!"
2,"Captivating, but in the end, cheap.","Although I haven't read more than 2 or 3 Stephen King books in my life, I have read a lot of fictional authors such as Michael Crichton and Frank Peretti. I found the first 2/3 of this book to be very well written for it's style and feel. I was captivated, interested, affected, and even scared. Unfortunately, as with many movies out there, the ending killed it for me. I found myself confused and lost late in the book and the end actually angered me a little. Not much was explained or resolved. It just ended. Like he got tired of writing and just decided to stop. It was like being involved in a really wonderful story with a main character that you've identified with and come to care about, and then the author just writes, ""And then he woke up, and it was all a dream"""
2,Writing assignment?,"Anticipating a good read I took this book on a long flight. The only reason I read it to the end was that my other choice of reading material was the SkyMall catalog. I was quite disappointed. This book reads as if a bright high school student was assigned to write a book mimicking a famous author, chose King, read the Stand and began to write. At some point the student realized that the assignment was due and simply ended the book. If I had been the teacher I would have given the student an ""A"" for imitating the writing style, a ""C"" for character development and an ""F"" for plot. King is capable of much more (see his short stories) and this book is an insult to his earlier work."
1,Worst Stephen King in a long time,"This book is terrible. Oh, it holds your interest, and the topic is certainly on-spot and almost inevitable. But the style is dreadful. If I didn't think he'd stoop so low, I'd find it easy to believe that King contracted this book out for someone else to write, and just lent his name to it. The book reads as if it were written by Dean Koontz, not by Stephen King. The character development, the descriptive phrases, the diaglogue, are not what you'd expect from King. The characters are flat, as is the dialogue. I was extremely disappointed."
2,"Excellent beginning and middle, no ending.","If I had written this review when I was even 1/2 or 3/4 way through it would have been a 4 or 5 star review. It starts fast and has a good premise, the ending though absolutely killed it for me. It completely leaves the reader hanging and doesn't resolve a single issue raised during the course of the book. It's like King hit the date for his deadline and just stopped writing."
4,A Return to His Horror Roots,"So the Cell is definitely a nice return to King's horror roots. It starts fast and turns the world on it's head in just a few ruthless moments. The characters are pretty compelling and likable for the most part. As a long-time ""constant reader"" of King's I'd say this book ranks somewhere in the middle for me. It's got some of his shorter prose and horror elements much like his earlier works but also incorporates some of his later tendencies to good effect. It's an effective, taut story that keeps the pace moving and is quite enjoyable from the first through the last page.Some people complain about the ending - and to be fair, there's a part of me that would have liked something a bit more definitive - but overall I thought the book worked very well and I enjoyed it quite a bit. While I wasn't blown away by it like I was by The Stand, Dark Tower or Salem's lot, there was a lot to like about this book if your already a Stephen King fan."
5,Excellent Book! I love Cell!,I am a big Stephen King fan and have read most of his work. This story is exciting and has a good pace and story to it. I finished it pretty quickly because it's interesting. Check it out if you are a fan of Stephen King.
2,great idea but boring,"The topic was a great idea. The story started our very interesting. But there was a 150 page section that basically, nothing happened."
4,Getting back to form!,"After King's questionable foray into the noir mystery with ""The Colorado Kid"" I am glad to see he can still beat the horror genre to death with great writing, exciting action, interesting concepts and truly scary stuff. I've been thinking about getting a cell phone, and now I'm not.Welcome back to the top of the heep Steve, we've been missing the old masterstroke."
2,"Skip It, You Won't Be Missing Much","I only cared about four characters in this book:1/ The manager of the hotel Clay was staying at(He was developing into probably the most complex person in the story)2/ The ""Head.""(I realize he was a bit like a caricature and stereotype but he reminded me of the late John Houseman)3/ Tom McCourt.(He had more depth than Clay or that teen chick brat)4/ Rafe the Cat.(Even though he wasn't human and was peripheral, he was still the most I cared about. Does anyone else here agree with me that it was not absolutely necessary for Tom to leave the poor guy behind?)"
1,Cell - and unfinished novel,"I've been a King fan for many years. This book was great ..... until you got to the end. It just leaves you hanging, never finding out what actually happened. It just stopped .... NOT ended .... just stopped! Save your money!!!!!"
1,"Refund, please","I am a King fan, have read nearly everything he has published and will purchase his next book sight-unseen. Having said that, ""Cell"" is a bad book, possibly his worst. There are good and interesting moments. (Read: ""Cinematic"" - coming to a theater near you by Christmas...) The gore is well done, the premise is interesting. But we've read significant elements of this book before and it's disheartening to read them warmed-over here. The ending is an unsatisfying cop-out involving a character we never knew and find it hard to care about. Fortunately by the end it's hard to care about any of the characters or plot elements. The whole effort is limp and unworthy of Big Steve."
2,Will the real Stephen King please come back...,"Cell: A Novel, was a gift given to me. I am a loyal fan of Steven King so, read his latest creation eager for a scare...didn't get it. Perhaps it's time to seek out better stories instead of famous authors. I would not pay full price for this one..."
3,King style catastrophe,"The idea is innovative and very contemporary. King's newest novel taps into social anxieties regarding mobile phones, though this proves to be only the device by which the author executes a typical storyline, identifiable as a Stephen King trademark: the journey of the hero through a landscape of disaster. Much like 'The Stand' and 'The Dark Tower' series, we follow well-developed characters as they struggle to survive amid an all-pervading disaster. Expect a typical Stephen King ending to round off the story."
4,Cell Phone Zombies? Heck Yeah!,"This books is a great, fast paced horror-adventure story. It is slightly reminiscent of the early chapters of the Stand, where the last survivors are just starting to realized what happened. The pace really doesn't let up, and it kept me hooked right to the last page. I know it is a horrible cliché to say, but I couldn't put it down."
3,Cell,"This was a really good read. It reminded me of some of George Romero's work with a touch more sci-fi than horror towards the end. I think the sci-fi, and the fact that Stephen King always leaves you hanging is the reason I didn't give it 5."
3,It just stops,The novel's ending leaves the reader wondering what happened. It's as if King just got tired of writing and just stopped -- there's no real resolution of the conflict. Too many important questions are left unanwered.
4,"Story not King's best, but OK","Story not bad, but didn't hold me like other Stephen King books have... Mostly Scott Campbell's reading was great, but every so often, the timber seemed to change and not fit in. Like those few words were recorded at a different time and edited in. Other than that, reading was great."
2,No ending?,"This was one of the most interesting books I have read. Until there was no ending. The book stops. It builds up to one of those moments that makes suspense/horror novels so gripping, and then it stops. Its as if the publisher only gave King a number of letters and spaces his book could contain, and he reached the limit exactly before the end. Perhaps he decided that there was no interesting way to read it. Even a bad ending would be better than a non-ending, at least in my opinion.I cannot suggest this book for two reasons. It was interesting enough to read, especially the beginning, however there are much better zombie or rage virus style books. One simply expects more from the master of horror. It would be a upper mid-grade contender in a genre with limited competition, although the lack of an ending is so stupefying that one almost regrets getting caught up in the action."
2,"Good Beginning, Slow Middle, Awful Conclusion","I'm not really into horror books, and haven't read but a couple of King's. I loved ""From a Buick 8"" and ""Lisey's Story"". This one, though, seemed to be written at about a sixth grade level. You really had to suspend reality to get through this one. How did people in different places hundreds of miles apart come up with the same terms, like ""phoners"", and ""pulse"", etc.? And I don't believe for a second that Clay, when he finally stumbles across his wife, would shove her out of his way like she'd never meant a thing to him. My biggest problem with the book is that King never tells us what caused the pulse, who did it, why they did it, was his son ever ok, did the world re-build itself, and on and on. I actually checked the binding of the library book because I was sure the last pages were torn out! I don't need an author to connect all the dots . . . just the POINT of the whole thing!"
1,"Disappointing, slow, plodding ""wanna-be"" zombie novel.","In the forward of King's new novel CELL, he dedicates it to the great George A. Romero and I AM LEGEND novelist Richard Matheson.That is where the mention of the trio in the same sentence should stop.This is just a ""MESS"" of a book. I am not sure where to even begin.Let me first start of by saying, that the ""zombies"" in King's story are NOT zombies. As a matter of fact, they have the ability of telepathy.Yes, you heard correctly I said: TELEPATHY!They don't eat human flesh, they eat twinkies and veggies.Character developement in the book follows the same silly premise.King attempts to compare the human brain to a desktop computer and his knowledge of a computer is child-like.Finally, the book is just plain BORING. Don't waste your time."
3,Great Theme Disappointing Ending,"I had stopped purchasing Stephen King novels as he was replaced by Bentley Little as my favorite author. His book was unavailable and this was so I thought I would give it a shot.The book's premise is superb; cell phones sending a pulse that causes people to become zombie-like homicidal maniacs. I thought it was a great idea and through the book I wasn't disappointed. On New Years Eve Day, I settled in and read almost 280 pages as it was riveting.I was extremely disappointed in the ending as it was somewhat predictable and the ending was the worst I've read of Stephen King.There are so many unanswered questions that were left unanswered such as who was behind ""The Pulse""?Were there ""flocks"" all over the country or limited to one area?I thought it was an superb idea but King just dropped the ball on delivery . I would love to have seen what Bentley Little would have done with a similar idea."
2,Doesn't live up to its potential,"I am a huge Stephen King fan, and when I learned that he had written a new book, I was ecstatic. It took me forever to get through this book!I did not think that the characters were fleshed out enough, and to be honest, I didn't think that the story got interesting until the middle part of the book. Overall, the book is okay, but it just didn't live up to my expectations for a King novel. Another reviewer opined that King had someone else write this novel for him - and it certainly seemed that way! This book lacks the 'magic' that most other King novels have."
2,Disappointing,"It seems that the idea for the story was never fully fleshed out. King came up with an interesting situation - cell phones turning all of Western civilization into zombies - but when it came time to explain the conditions causing the situation, he was unable to produce anything more creative than a scary (and entirely implausible) computer program. The first half of the book moves along at a good clip when King's describing the carnage and immediate fallout of the cellphone conversion, but starts to drag badly when he tries to peek behind the curtain to discover what's causing the apocalypse.As a bonus, you'll get a healthy dose of left-wing opinion as King slings thinly veiled insults at the Bush administration, oil companies, and the traditional nuclear family. Thanks, Steve-O, but that's really not why I read your stuff.Too many loose ends and a terrible conclusion. Borrow it from the library, 'cause this isn't one you'll want to own."
3,The science was weak,"This novel is Stephen King dabbling in Science Fiction rather than the Supernatural. While he's done that a few times with success, I really didn't feel this was one of those times. The whole central premise didn't feel plausible to me, and the novel failed to back up the 'attack' with any specificity as to its cause, origin, or nature. It needed some kind of afterward that tossed forward at least the hint of an explanation. So what we have is something that's much like a Zombie survival novel, with a different sort of Zombie. The nature of the foe does develop a bit more, but I won't spoil the surprises (few as there are). The character development felt rather shallow to me to a SK novel, and the plot was rather nonexistent. When reading it, it didn't even feel to me like it was written by SK. Not his best work."
2,Is there a sequel?,Great start; good story; but no resolution of the terrible effect of that critical instant that affected a huge number of people - probably around the world. Is King just setting us up for the SEQUEL?
3,Dawn of the Dead with rollover minutes,"Many people have compared this with King's earlier novel 'The Stand',(which I think is his best), and it's easy to see why. Both deal with the near total destruction of mankind, here from a pulse through a cell phone, and not from the super flu that claimed millions in the previous book. Both follow a group of rag tag survivors as they work there way through the country to an ultimate showdown with the forces of evil. Yet in 'Cell' there's much more left to the imagination. There is no pat wrapped up conclusion that brings the story to a tidy close, and frankly we never even get to the source of the pulse. That doesn't seem to be the central issue though. At the end of the day King has crafted a technological cautionary tale in full on zombie mode. And while I personally didn't think it was as engaging or involving as 'The Stand',it's still an entertaining and slightly chilling what if."
4,I enjoyed this book more any other since THE STAND,This book was a page turner for me. It is violent and graphic in places (even for SK). Basically the plot is cell phone zombies try to take over. The characters were easy to follow unlike some of his past books. It was not as long as many of his works. I would recommend it to any SK fan. I have read all his books and it was in the top 3 for me behind THE STAND and SALEM'S LOT.
2,Not up to his usual standard,"I will have to disagree with the majority of the current reviews and state that this book lacks his usual good workmanship and high quality. The characters are flat and, for the most part, without definition. When they do have back-story, or are infused with any detail, it is usually stereotypical and bland. The plot tastes recycled and the device is something that his constant readers have seen before. This book lacks the poetry that has infused his major works, from IT to The Dark Tower. Really I was disappointed with this offering. After looking forward to it for so long I received what was essentially a parrody of himself."
2,"Actually, it's a heavily padded novella","As always, King sets up a wonderful premise, but you feel like you've read it before -- THE STAND. But with THE STAND you had various characters from all over the US and they each had backstories. Here, you have just a handful--and a pretty dull lot at that. Like THE STAND, they have to make a journey and that's where CELL falls apart--that's all it is, a journey. By page 50, you realize that's about it -- the Pulse is NEVER explained, and the pretty dull characters blow up stuff, have mind-visions, and then the book is over.If it had been a 50 page novella, I think it would have been more compelling and successful. At 350 pages, it's simply wearisome."
5,Guys without imagination,"may not like this book. It is fast, it is gory, it is scary and it is funny. King knows how to write a fast-reading book and he shows that his range of abilities goes from writing fast-paced, whiteknuckle horror books to very moving, literary efforts (Lisey's Story) like an oil over the water. Feverishly recommended, this slim book makes you look suspiciouly at your mobile phone everytime it shrills!!!"
2,A let-down compared to King's other works,"The idea of this story was interesting, but it just fell short in its execution. The ending, especially, was such a let-down, just a ""cliff-hanger"" which is inexcusable when investing in a long novel. Stephen King is my favorite horror author - I love his classics, but not everything he writes can be a masterpiece, I suppose. It somebody else wrote this book, I would give it three stars, but I only give this two stars because I expect much more from King."
3,Good read but rushed poor ending.,I am a King fan but this one falls short. It starts out great but then ends with a whimper. Although it is not King's best it is still better read than most.
2,"Ah, so-so...","MY BOY! LOOK WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO MY BOY! (lol) Sorry.You know...How many more stories like this do we have to put up with? You got Dawn of the Dead (both the original and the remake), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (both the original and remake), The Taking, Night of the Comet, War of the Worlds, on and on, even Red Dawn. Their internal components may be different (though interchangeable), but the premise is the same. Small bands of people on the run from the evil majority. It's become tiresome.This time the story surrounds a guy, accompanied by a handful of survivors, who's looking for his son amid a bunch of cellular-zonked zombies. I think I would've like it better if everyone got microwaved from their cell phones and their heads just exploded. The book would've only been about fifteen pages long, but I've always believed in quality over quantity.I don't know what's going on. Really good stuff is so damn hard to come by these days."
2,Phoned it in!,"Over the years I have read a lot of Stephen King books. I really had decided not to read any more because I felt like he was in the business of selling books rather than writing a good story. This book did nothing to prove me wrong. It was just one bloody disfigured person after another and a very thin plot line. The main story line really doesn't even make sense in the world of computers, cell phones and wireless communication. I can't recommend it and I think I'll be skipping the Stephen King novels again for a while. Hopefully, he will find his love for writing once again and prove that he has the talent we all know that he has."
3,Happy With Everything But The Ending,"I have not read Stephen King in years, but decided to try again when I read about this book. I must say, I could not put the book down and when I did, I just thought about when I could pick it up again. There were questions that I wanted answers to. Where is the Pulse coming from? Where is Johnny? Can Clay save Johnny? I kept reading on and on, anticipating the answers to these questions, but, never got the answers. Very disappointing ending. Still not quite sure what happened and left wondering why Mr. King left us hanging like he did."
3,where's the ending???,"i squealed with delight that there was something new for me to devour from king. i read the book in one day and then at the very end was so disgusted by the lack of closure. it is like he ran out of time or paper or electricity and phoned in the ending. i really hope that he is working on a second part. even his short story ""the mist"" had better closure."
3,Hopeful of a Sequel,"I enjoyed this book until the very end, when the final words left me somewhat deflated and disappointed. I hope King plans to write a sequel to this novel to answer all the questions the storyline left behind. King developed a great story, full of twists and turns and although it's good to leave one imagining the possibilties of what may have happened, this story and the characters portrayed deserved to have a closure which justified their existence in the first place.Well worth the read."
2,A Re-Vamped Yawn,"The devastating plague which kills or drives mad half the human race ... the ""zombies"" with their love of blood and gore ... their strange and charismatic leader ... the brave little band of survivors strugging against terrible odds to reach safety -... the devoted father's race to save his child ... the secret which the good guys know and the bad guys don't, which enables good to triumph ... It's all been done before, and making the ""plague"" a mobile phone virus doesn't render it new or original. In fact, don't I remember King writing it already - wasn't it called The Stand? There were a couple of gripping moments in Cell, but overall it was so predictable I found myself skimming the pages. Borrow a copy if you must read it, and don't waste your money."
3,"Enjoyable, if not top of the line, King","Stephen King's ""Cell"" is an enjoyable horror novel that will remind you of ""Night of The LIving Dead,"" ""28 Days Later"" and ""The Omega Man"" as well as King's own ""The Stand."" A strange signal broadcast over cell phones turns a large part of the world's population into mindless zombies. A diverse group of unaffected people travel across New England, as they search for graphic artist Clay Riddell's estranged wife and son. Along the way, they find that perhaps the ""zombies"" are not as mindless as they seem. While some of this novel is derivative of King's other works and themes, this is a well-written horror novel that can be enjoyed on its own terms. As usual King's flair for character and dialogue are in good form. There are also, as usual, references to some of King's other works. A solid thriller from Mr. King."
4,"welcome back, Stephen King!","Finally, Stephen King gets back to his roots! No attempts at psychological horror here, or introspection and analysis. Back to straight-up in-your-face terror, with creepiness and blood practically from page one. As always, King has trouble with the ending, but not as badly as some others. All in all, a good scary read of the likes we haven't seen from him in a while."
4,"Fun, rage filled zombie romp","I liked this book. It was a fast paced read for me and was based on the premise that a signal being broadcast through cell phones will drive anyone who hears it into rage (think of 28 days later - rage filled zombies). The story follows a man trying to find his family after this occurs and the people he meets along the way. Overall, the book was a fun read, and had an interesting twist in the middle, but I disliked the ending. I can't help feeling that King got tired of writing and just stopped - adding a hasty ending."
4,Very Good Story,"This was a good Stephen King book. Complete with horror and gore. It was fast paced as many Stephen King books are. My only complaint was that theending was not definative. It sort of kept you wondering what happened when the main character put the phone up to his son's ear. Also how the structure of the world would be now. Also would have liked a definative description of the source of the pulse including what it's purpose was. I suppose leaving these questions unanswered could allow for a sequal book to be written. It is now approximately four years since this book was written so I doubt it. But then it took King thirty-three years to finish the Dark Tower Series or a good number of years to write a sequel to ""Tailsman"" so who knows expect from Stephen King. In conclusion I would recommend this book to read"
3,pretty good Stephen King,"I started to read this book mostly because I heard that a big part of the book took place in my hometown. However, I was addicted to the novel. The concept is simple, killer cell phones-kind of,a pulse of some kind is delivered to people via their phones. One day while the main character is doing business in Boston he witnesses society breaking apart by this pulse that turns those who receive it into some kind of homicidal zombie. He than befriends another gentleman and a young girl as he tries to get home to Maine to be with his son and wife. The book is creepy and a bit suspenseful, as well as a bit sad towards the end. The book does began to slow down a bit towards the end, but still a good read, although it does have a traditional Stephen King ending."
2,The King is Back,"Ignore the two stars - it should be five but I can't figure out how to change it!For a long time, I would buy a Stephen King book and promise myself that if it wasn't any better than the last one I would NEVER buy another. Then the book would suck and I'd see the next one, make the same promise and the cycle would continue. Boy, am I glad I continued the cycle with Cell. I started reading it during lunch yesterday and when I heard my cell phone ring about an hour later I just stood and looked at it with trepidation.Constant Reader, if you've been afraid of the dark for the last several years, come back - the water is fine - and don't be afraid to ask yourself ""Who do you love?"""
1,CELL a stupid book,not only is it a stupid book...its a very stupid book and a waste of time to read.
1,I did NOT purchase this product...,I didn't purchase this product so I'm not sure why I am receiving this message. Someone please explain.
1,Weakness also,"Ha, I bought this thinking it was just a English paperback, boy was I wrong. They need to adjust fire for us lazy folks, and make it dummy clear for peeps that they are not buying a book in English."
1,The King of banality,This book is just another predictable zombie style story with the typical characters and events we have already seen a millions times. King fans will probably not want to admit that King has dethroned himself with his own rehashed storys which have been dumped into book stores for the last eight years since he wrote a good book. If you haven't read Bag of Bones or Hearts in Atlantis - check those out before reading this recent dross.
2,Interesting concept - Underdeveloped storyline,"I have not read a lot of Stephan King, but I have read enough to know this was not his best work. I was very disappointed in the way the story was developed. There was no plot!"
2,Readable Fluff.,"Two stars is generous & I am only this charitable due to my love of Stephen Kings writing. Steve has been off the boil for some time now & for this I forgive him. He has created such masterpieces in his long & illustrious career, that it would be impossible for any writer to keep up with such high & often genious standards. Shades of the old, brilliant Steve were evident in the Dark Towers 'Wolves of Calla', & in reading this I foung myself encapsulated in the good old days of 'The Stand', The Tommyknockers' & IT. CELL was a quick, economical read, devoid of any emotion or compelling story line, complete with a fistfull of vacuous, immature characters, wandering aimlessly in a desolate landscape. Disappointing, yet readable fluff, that only a recent reader of King could enjoy... delve into that back catalogue & find out what a real thriller is. Sorry Steve, I still love you, think Ill read 'The Running Man ' again to renew my faith."
3,Good Book but Audio version is BOR-ing,"I received the CD yesterday. I thought the audio version would be like the audio version of The Historian. I could not get through the first 2 CDs without falling asleep. The reader lacks expression and is very much a monotone. If you want to keep from snoozing, read the book along with the CD. Don't play it on the ride home from work. You may regret it."
2,Filing cabinet scraps.,"King writes the dates he worked on his novels on the last page, and it seems the amount of work he put into this one was a farse. While the first half of the book follows a man through a zombie plagued northeast with little happening but typical zombie mayhem, it finally reaches some interesting plot lines around page 190..that took some time for something imaginative to happen. Then as you near the end, King seems to throw in the towel as with most of his endings of late, as with the long awaited DARK TOWER finale. It is a quick read, so not much time is wasted on it if you hate the ending. Not a terrible book, but for King fans it is a let down. Wait for paperback and save a few bucks."
5,Another Winner,"Great book (as usual). The premise is very reminiscent of The Stand, but the origniality and appropriateness of the story make it shine with a light all of its own. I think that the 'easy way out' King took with the conclusion of the Dark Tower Series ( easy but probably the best in that case) may have influenced him to do so again in this story. I wouldn't say that I disliked Cell's ending, but I think it deserved more closure."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"In spite of mixed reader reviews I dug right into Cell. As most of the King novels, it opens swiftly, riveting your attention. While I'd agree with some of the commentary that the characters could have had a bit more development, I found this to be a good read that allowed me to envision each scenario vividly (a trait in King novels that I adore). Perhaps the ending is a bit open-ended for those who like their knots and bows neatly tied, but I was not bothered by it, nor did I feel short-changed.I do recommend this book, and if you've read King's entire works, then surely you will not wish to overlook this offering."
5,Gripping,"I have to offset the tool before me that gave 1 star to this book. 1 star despite the fact you call yourself a king fan!? Have you read the dark tower series? You can see his writing style change. No kidding.ANYWAYS... review... review. Ah.. um well If you've read many other King novels you will have noticed that he takes upwards of 100 pages to develop characters and scene... whatever. The big difference in this book is his attempt to grab you on the first page. That was all it took. I remember being like 200 pages deep in salems lot and thinking ""I hate this town"". No, no dreary plot develepment not that I'm complaining but here you will find a unique piece of kings work. This book does not quit. Read the first page, thats all you need to do, you have my solemn guarantee as a person you dont know that that will be enough."
3,"Cell: A Novel, but Not a Good One.","As an avid reader I was enthused to hear of King's return to pure horror. When I found out the book was about technology and terror I couldn't resist seeig the spin King would yarn on this subject. The book begins well enough, the usual ""band of believers"" surviving the ""Pulse"" and seeking answers. Then the book drops the call. The book was headed for a solid four star review until the end. The ending was completely contrived, as if written to meet a deadline later that same day. What was the Pulse? I don't know. Who was behind it? You got me there too? What about Clay's son? Who knows. What of the rest of the gang? Nothing. No word on anything. End the end ""The Pulse"" was weak and shortly faded completely. King flatlined on this one. Good idea, bad book."
3,Definitely not what I expected,"I've read the majority of Mr. King's books, however, this one was very disappointing. It was a page turner at first, but the ending was, there's not even a word for it. The story felt incomplete, but there wasn't really enough room for a sequel. Maybe his next novel will not be as bad."
4,4 Stars,"I found this to be very similar to The Stand. I'm sure most people who have read his earlier novel will agree. I was still glad that Mr. King decided to write a rather gory sci-fi horror story. Even though it did remind me of his earlier novel, I still enjoyed the ride and the graphics. I didn't enjoy the ending so much, though.I think readers new to Stephen King will really enjoy this novel, more so than his established fans."
4,"I am not much of a King reader, but I enjoyed this quite a bit","I have only read a few of his books, and am neither a fan nor a hater (he has plenty of both, so no need to add to them). It kept me interested to the end, which is all I can ask.For those who say it is not realistic . . . that should be sort of expected, no?"
2,Tourists among Zombies,"This might have been an interesting idea for a short story (like du Maurier's The Birds), it might even have made an interesting novel if planned properly (like Crichton's Prey), but King just lets the narrative ramble on in a meandering way. The main characters are tourists for much of the story. They walk a lot and they look a lot, but they don't do much, and the things they do consist mainly of blowing things up; the American Way, perhaps, but hardly imaginative storytelling. It isn't even scary, because so little happens. If it weren't for King's fluency of language it would have been a torment to read."
5,One of my favorite book's,"I like to keep my review's simple and to the point. I do not like to spoil the fun for other's. In this case I want to say so much but I can't without spoiling the book. The book follow's Clay the protagonist. Basically without giving too much away, the cell phones make anyone using them crazy. So as you can imagine civilization goes to pot. Clay is struggling to get home to his son and bring's along some people he has met along the way. But it is not as simple as it seem's. With the phone crazies running loose this throws a wrench into Clay's plans. I could not put this book down I read it in 2 sittings. The second time around I did the same thing even though I knew the outcome. This book was a fresh and to me a constant reader a diffrent twist on the end of the world."
4,Typical Stephen King,"This is a typical Stephen King, blood, guts and gore as well as good writing. He adds little details which paint pictures in the readers mind. Although I am not finding myself especially attached to any of the characters, his story carries you along without time to catch your breath. It did make me think of ""The Stand"", my all time favorite King. It may not stand out as a piece of literature to discuss in a book group, however, it is a neat way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon."
3,It's Not The Stand,"Super-fans of The Stand will immediately notice the similarities between that book and Cell and will be disappointed with Cell for that reason. I have read The Stand too many times to count and for me it remains King's very best. I don't think he should have done another end of the world format, unless it was to let his Constant Readers know what happened to Frannie and Stu after they left Nebraska. In Cell, it would have been cool if somehow Randall Flagg released The Pulse, giving a small nod to those of us who look for clues to repeated themes in King's work.I enjoyed Cell and can easily recommend it. However, after reading it, I had to pick up The Stand and flip through its comfortable pages....a book I enjoy like the company of an old friend."
2,Re-runs in book form...who knew?,"If I'd wanted to read the Stand again I have several copies of it in my bookshelves. I am a great fan of King, that being said I'd like to say to Mr. King:""Can you here me now Stephen? Did you really think your die-hard fans wouldn't see through this transparent re-write of The Stand?""Stephen King set the bar, if he can't jump over it anymore maybe its time he retired from the Olympics because it's just too painful to watch the Master hit the ice so hard."
3,Its average,"Its average. I have read every Stephen King book and this isn't his best, or his worst. Its an ok book. It is a little too packed. It tries to cram too much into too small of a package. ""The Stand"" is a much better ""end of the world"" novel. If you have already read the Stand (and It, and Salem's lot, and Dream Catcher and the Shining and Isomina and....) then this is a fun book. It does feel like watching a horror movie. You can read it in one or two sittings and get a good deal of enjoyment out of it. But don't expect to be won over if you haven't read or didn't enjoy his past works."
3,What happened to the ending? An advertisment for his next book?,"I have read all of S.K.'s work and have enjoyed most. His descriptive style and manipulation of language make his books fun to read, along with his sense of humor.What really, really, and I mean REALLY!!!!!! bothered me about this book is THERE WAS NO ENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just an ad for ""Lisey's Story""! What is this, capitalism runs amok! yikes!Read it for fun. The first half is a blast and fun to read...then it loses itself, but hey, thanks SK for coming back and writing again. The alternative is worse than this work."
4,"Walk, Again","On occasion my dreams flash on the elements of the scary Bachman story ""The Long Walk"". Now joining ""The Stand"" and Roland on the road we have another chance to see our society on foot. Many touchs of the familiar, King has done some of this before, but as time passes the observations have matured. A very good lean page turner."
1,"Who are you, and what have you done with Stephen King?","Who wrote this book? Stephen King's stong point has always been character development. In Cell, what little there is, is poorly done. There's on ongoing rumor since S.K's. books have started to decline (Dreamcatcher, Buick 8, Final 3 DarkTower books that stunk), that SK is no longer the writer, that he's pulling another Bachman trick on ""Constant Reader"". With each new book, this rumor becomes more believable. This is the second book in a row (Colorado Kid being the prior) and the third book of late (Buick 8) that has no ending. The author, whoever's at the helm, just gets up from the word processor and walks away leaving ""Constant Reader"" unfulfilled.Gone are the ""Classic King"" stories, gone are the characters we love (or love to hate [ R.F. ] ) now there's bottom of the barrel writing fit for a third rate movie of the week."
2,Disappointing,"OK, in all fairness, this is my first Stephen King novel. Surely, with all the success the man has had, with all the readers who love him, he must have written better than this. Neither the writing style nor the storyline inspired me. Based on the reviews I've read, though, this book is a departure from his normal style, so I will have to read a classic, like ""The Shining"" or ""The Dead Zone"" in order to see what all the hype is about."
3,"Ok, But Not His Best!","I liked the idea of this book, a bit of an update on the 'Invasion of The Bodysnatchers' theme, but I found the book just a little bit disappointing. I felt the main characters were a bit cliched, and a bit more two-dimensional, than in other novels by this author.I also felt, that there were a few 'loose ends' that were never really tied up at the end of the book. I felt there was a bit of an unfinished feel to it. Overall, it wasn't too bad a novel, but, in my opinion, far from the best, by this author."
3,"Stephen King, sell a novel",I don't think Stephen King wrote this; we're all on the outside of a big practical joke.
1,Still waiting,"I read the ""Stand"" maney years ago and thought S. King was my kind of writer. I have been reading and waiting for something else by him to just be good, not even great. The cell was a very wrong number. Boring and really made no sense as a possible scenario or even fake horror. Night of the living dead with cell phones. No more S. King for me."
1,Rubbish book,I was expecting so much more! The stand is still one of the best books I have ever read. This one on the other hand started well but end badly. It took me about three weeks to read I normally polish off a good book in a day or two.
1,Bad!,"Finished this today. Put off reading it because the cover looked so silly! FINALLY made myself read it, shouldnt judge a book by its cover??? I wish I would have never looked twice at it. King has lost his touch...ever since the car accident all his books have been childish crap."
4,A good quick read,"I wanted to read a zombie book. I picked up Cell. I got an engaging, intelligent, thought-provoking gory zombie story. Just what I was looking for!"
3,Not as good as I hoped,"Stephen King does Zombies? Hell yeah. I was a little disappointed by Cell. It's not a bad book by any means, but I just wish Stephen King had written this twenty years ago. This had the potential to be another Stand, instead it fell short."
3,If The Stand and Tommy Knockers had a baby.............,"it would be named The Cell. eek. The Colorado Kid and now this. Back to back feelings of being ripped off by basically the only author I have ever consistently read. And I was so excited about a new book by King. Oh well, I am not going to stop reading his new releases now, but I am starting to be reminded of an aging athlete that doesn't know when to quit (Michael Jordan/Jerry Rice). If nothing else try and find the Dark Tower link. This is a 2.5 star effort at best. COME ON KING YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS!"
1,Worst SK novel ever!,I was greatly unimpressed with this story. All it is is a version of The Stand. What an embarassment! I read it when it first came out and refused to read a SK book for many years. FINALLY read Duma Key and that brought me back to King. The Cell should be burnt. SK should be embarassed to present this to his fans. I truly thought he needed to retire after this one. Duma Key and Under The Dome brought me back tho. The Cell still makes me roll my eyes tho.
3,He's Baaaaaaack!,"Yep. The Stephen King I knew and loved is back. It's been a long time since I bought one of his books because they began not rivaling his earliest efforts. In ""Cell"" he has gone back to (his) basics.Just one thing. The very first line of the novel says, ""The event that came to be known as The Pulse began at 3:03, eastern standard time, on the afternoon of October 1."" For a writer as prolific as King, how could he make such an error IN THE FIRST SENTENCE and not catch it, or have an editor not catch it. Hello!!! October 1 is still daylight savings time."
3,I should have waited for paperback.,"I love zombie movies and Stephen King, but Cell was kind of a disappointment on both counts. For a relatively short book, it had too many long, slow parts, and it sometimes had the same aimless feel as The Colorado Kid. The strongest point in the story was the characters, especially Alice, but Stephen King has a bad habit of letting you know 150 pages in advance when one of them is going to die.Overall, anything King writes is probably worth reading, I just wish I hadn't rushed to buy the hardback version."
1,Junk,"Purchased from Amazon, it was entertaining and predictable, and the bargain price was appropriate. But after the contemptible comments that little stevie made regarding our troops earlier this week, it's headed for the garbage, and will be the last Stephen King item I ever purchase. King claims that he knows some members of the National Guard from there in Bangor - if so, I hope that he gets the opportunity to run into a few."
3,could have been better,"This novel seemed rushed. I love Stephen King's writing, but this book felt a little too ""get it done to get it out there"" to me. There are good parts, of course -- what King novel doesn't have them -- but King used the same resolution twice to rid the characters of problems. I won't ruin the story for those who haven't read the book, but you'll see what I'm talking about when you do read it. I think this book would have been better if King would have expanded more on the characters. After all, aren't characters Stephen King's trademarks. This one is more plot-driven and just doesn't live up to its full potential.Read it anyway. It's good, just not King's best."
2,"Man, King Has Changed!!!","I have been an avid King collector for better than twenty years. I have a wonderful collection of his works, all in hardback and most 1st editions. Over the past few years I have not been thrilled with a lot of his work, yet I continue to collect. This novel is one in which I tried to read, but only made it about two-thirds of the way through. King gives a whole new meaning to the word 'BORING'. After the initial 'pulse', there's very little action, and it gets to where turning the pages becomes a complete drudgery. I know King is good, and I hope he has a few good novels left in him; however, this one isn't it."
2,Good start...,"Ok, I'll have to admit - half way through, I lost interest and quit. The opening was great, full of promise, then it just sort of dragged on and became hard to stay with it. I am a big King fan, but this one is worth passing on if you want resolution. The action in the front is great and the writing superb...it just got boring."
3,Is there a sequel?,The book is a great Stephen King concept. He does'nt make the reader wait and within a few pages the story's on. The usual excellent character description and detail. Without giving the story away it's a wild ride but it seems to run out of steam towards the end and for ME the ending is unsatisfactory. That's the difference between 5 stars and the 3 I gave it.
3,The Root of All Evil!,"This was my first time reading a Stephen King and it was ok. I felt like there was a lot of slow spots but it was interesting (if that makes sense). It took almost two months to read the book but I finished it. I don't think I'll be picking up another SK novel any time soon, but I enjoyed the different feel of something that I normally read. My problem was, I wish there was more deaths and gory details to keep the novel more interesting."
3,Didn't King Used to Write Resolutions?,"The book was great. I couldn't put it down. I, in fact, was extremely disappointed when all there was left to read was the acknowledgment page. I'm not quite sure how we got there. It felt like he took me up a path toward a climax, which seemed to have happened, but he never brought me back down. I don't need a happy ending. I don't need all the loose ends all tied up. I do, however, need something at the end. I really loved the whole book, until the last few pages. I definitely wanted to have a couple of other chapters to help bring me down. If you're gonna leave the mystery, do it in a fun way that doesn't feel like you just forgot to publish the last chapter. I literally kept reading because I didn't realize it was over."
3,Book was great until the end,"I'd classify ""Cell"" as just mediocre. King spent so much time building the characters and building up the plot. But in the end, it was like he just gave up. The ending was very anticlimactic. And it didn't even explain who was behind the Pulse or if his son turned out okay. I just felt like the book was great up until the SAVE TO SYSTEM chapter at the end. Then it felt like he just wanted to finish it and threw an ending together. Very disappointing."
3,Is it Just me??,"I don't know what's wrong! Don't know if this is just me or what!! I can't get past half the book, not interested to finish it, even though I consider myself the #1 fan of Stephen King but this book didn't hit right for me. I really don't know. It's not the King I loved. But then again, I might be wrong, as I still didn't finish it. I'll try though.."
1,Dropped call....,As a huge Stephen King fan I really looked forward to reading this book but was quickly disappointed. There's no real character development. I would like to know who Tom was before the pulse or what Alice was like before the pulse. It started off very strong but towards the middle it started to lag and then eventually stopped. I didn't feel like I was reading a true Stephen King book at all. This felt like a third rate 'The Stand' with cell phones instead of a flu virus. 'The Stand' was a much better read.
2,Not The Stand,"All previous reviewers hit the nail on the head comparing to ""The Stand"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"".This book is not in the league of either,but may have merited a chapter in ""The Stand"".Overall I rate Stephen King a 5 as an author of my choice,I read all his books, but this story was a disappointment."
2,Not impressed,"I think that King was in a big hurry, when he wrote last chapters of the book. A lot, lot of open questions remains. From where was the pulse initiated, who pull the trigger and why etc... No, King obviously had a dead line and decided to cut the story.At least, it's not fair to readers. I've got a lot of his books, but Cell is far below King's standards."
1,Irritating,"This was a seriously disappointing novel...especially for such a die hard fan of Stephen King, like myself. After reading many other reviews, I have to agree that the 'no ending' was aggravating. But I could have tolerated it if I hadn't been left with a million and one questions. Where, why, how and who were COMPLETELY unanswered which made the story completely pointless. A shame since the plot had so much potential. Pass it up, folks. Re-read one of his better novels instead- 'Insomnia' being my personal favorite :)"
1,What Is it With Stephen King?,He was the one who gave us:CarrieThe ShiningSalem's LotThe StandNow he writes an absurdity like the Cell?This could have been such a fantastic book. But instead it is a dull mess full of absurdities.
2,"Avoid like the plague. A slow, plodding ""wanna-be"" zombie novel.","In the forward of King's new novel CELL, he dedicates it to the great George A. Romero and I AM LEGEND novelist Richard Matheson.That is where the mention of the trio in the same sentence should stop.This is just a ""MESS"" of a book. I am not sure where to even begin.Let me first start of by saying, that the ""zombies"" in King's story are NOT zombies. As a matter of fact, they have the ability of telepathy.Yes, you heard correctly I said: TELEPATHY!They don't eat human flesh, they eat twinkies and veggies.Character developement in the book follows the same silly premise.King attempts to compare the human brain to a desktop computer and his knowledge of a computer is child-like.Finally, the book is just plain BORING. Don't waste your time."
1,Constant Readers Will Be Disappointed!,"I've been an avid fan of Mr. King's creative writing for quite some time now, and like so many other ""Constant Readers,"" I waited in anticipation for this novel. The premise of the story is brilliant; I must admit. By the time I got to page 35, however, I couldn't help but think of a story that was quite similar to The Stand.I was willing to let that notion slide but this story is lacking so much of the depth that Constant Readers find all too appealing in Mr. King's literary world. The characters are flat, the dialogue is boring, and I caught myself too many times, skimming the pages to find the ""good stuff.""Don't get me wrong, Cell is chock-full of Mr. King's signature gory details but it's not enough to keep this reader's interest. His initial premise of the story was quite exciting but the style in which it is told gives me the impression that he had nothing better to do with his time."
3,Nothing New,"Cell isn't a bad book. It's not a good book either. Its somewhere in between. I probably would have rated it higher if I hadn't read most of Mr. King's other books. If you're like me, you will find themes that have already been explored in better Stephen King novels and stories, including The Stand (us v. them apocalyptic future), The Mist (a man and his son), Pet Sematary (undead), The Tommyknockers (mental powers), The Long Walk (trudging towards doom). I was looking and hoping for something new, but never found it."
3,A re-hash of his older books....,"I read Cell fairly quickly, but I was disappointed. The major disappointment is King doesn't provide any conclusion to the story. The book seems to just come to a stop part way through. No explanation is given as to the ultimate cause of the nightmare, or how it was resolved.The other feeling I had reading it is that it's a re-hash of his other books like The Stand, The Mist, etc. You know, there's some sort of large scale catastrophe, there's a small group of survivors who come together, etc. etc. It even has an old woman with cat's-eye glasses who spouts religious gibberish (reminded me of the religious woman in The Mist). Also there's a character who reminded me of Randall Flagg from The Stand. The characters even share the same dreams just like in The Stand.In all, it held my interest, but unlike his older books like Firestarter I have no desire to go back and re-read my favorite parts. Final verdict: warmed-over ""The Stand""."
1,This book is terrible,"I'm not even going to finish it, which is rare for me. Cliched, badly paced, poor characterization ... I could go on, but look at the other bad reviews if you want more, I think they all say the same thing. I used to like King a lot back in the The Day, but it's been years since I enjoyed his work."
3,So disappointing!,"The book is very intriguing to start, one wants to know what is going to happen and that same intrigue lasts throughout the book. Then when he has you glued to the book, he lets you down. I think he spent so much time in the beginning he had no place to go to climax. I was so incredibly disappointed when I finsihed this book. If I had known that I would be let down in the end, I would have stopped reading it when they were stuck in Kashwak!"
4,Fast paced and scary!,"I'm not a big fan of Stephen King but this I liked!! I was well written, and easier to follow than my previous experience with Stephen King. There were parts of the story that I felt were very far fetched and hard to believe but then again, that's what he is all about. So if I didn't think about it and just read the book I loved it! Not only did I like it, but I could turn the lights off at bedtime for awhile. I would even recommend this novel to those who don't normally read Stephen King's work."
3,Piss-Poor Bootleg,Three classic Gamera films collected on one disc in poor quality. Spend your money on the excellent Shout Factory releases instead!
2,"Does the financial breakdown bolster Vacca's ""Coming Dark Age?""","I am re-reading this book after many years. Certainly it makes lots of stark predictions, not grounded in the normal data and authorities. Its sobering message, however, is a bit more plausible these days. While you are waiting for your stocks to rebound, give this book a read."
1,Too wobbly!!!,"The main selling point of this item is that it's interchangeable with other Racor hanging systems. Unfortunately, the quality of the attachment to the wall leaves such a large gap between the hanger and the wall that it wobbles badly when touched. It's actually not very safe if you have a couple of things hanging, and then want to hang another item. The jostling could cause the other items to fall. I had to place a wooden wedge between the metal rack and the wall to stiffen the mount. In all, I have my tools hung up and it's 'reasonably' safe, but this would not have worked 'out of the box'."
2,Badly edited,"I have to concur; the performance is fine, but the editing is really bothersome. Face it: would you want to see a closeup of the oboist's beard, or watch the opera? At times, these cuts to the orchestra occur every 8 seconds! Kim Rasmussen (the editor listed) should be forced to spend the next few years listening to Billy Budd over and over again (and my apologies to all you Britten fans out there, but I couldn't think of anyone else that I dislike more)!Addendum: the video image itself is pristine, but all three audio tracks (inc. DTS) are very muffled. The DVD is probably my worst sounding opera.Addendum #2: Just played it again using the PCM digital through an Audio Research D-A over Kef speakers. The audio still sucks! The orchestra is sounds almost like a mono recording from the 50's. Given the quality of the video, they really could have done better."
1,Hopeless!,"This book is some kind of joke. And I'm the last one to laugh, 'cause I had to spend over 60$ on this one. It is full of screenshots and hardly any verbage. If there is any, it simply gives you the basic navigation instructions for 11i screens. Well, it did one good thing though, it inspired me to write a book on the subject that I have no knowledge on. Here's what I'm going to do. Get all the user manuals, tear them apart and throw the pages in the air. Which ever land on a table, simply collect them, bind them together, and viola...you have a book with a title that reads something like ""Implementing some hi-tech applications...blah blah blah..."" !"
5,family crisis,"Antonia Forest has written a long series of books about the Marlowe family (some of which are impossible to get your hands on. They're all out of print). This book is set during their holidays when the oldest girl in the family suddenly marries an older man and brings him home with his three children from a previous marriage. If you haven't read any of the other books, this one would probably be difficult to follow. If you have, however, you will love it. The tension between people is acute. You see them at their worst and best. It's magnificently written. You know, children probably wouldn't like it even though it's a children's story. That's the problem. Antonia Forest is one of the greatest writers of all time. I love this book. I wish they were all in print and I wish I had them to read and read again."
5,Fantastic release of a great soundtrack,"It'd been years since I'd seen or heard this movie. We used to have the movie on VHS and the soundtrack on vinyl, so you can imagine how much I've seen and heard it in this digital age.This 25 year anniversary CD is everything I hoped it would be. Given that it is a soundtrack to a short film, all the music here really only come to 25 minutes. The first half of the CD is the story narrated over the music (synchronized, of course) and the second half is the stand-alone score. Both times ""Walking in the Air"" appears on the CD, it is sung by the boy, Peter Auty.The music itself embodies the mystery of Christmas better than any other music I've heard. It's not very often music brings tears to my eyes, but this CD did it. You'll find the best music is from the second half of the film, especially dancing in the boy's playroom, riding the motorbike, ""Walking in the Air"", and the snowman dance.In short, this CD is a must in any Christmas music collection!"
2,Not what I thought,I don't know if it was because I didn't read what this was but I was not expecting the CD to be a book on tape. I was hoping for this to be a score of the animated show I loved so much. I was very disappointed when I put the CD in my car. I'll have to find the one song on it and copy it then I will probably sell the CD to someone else.
5,My Favorite Christmas story/audio/video,I have been trying to find the audio to this very beautiful and heartstirring Christmas story for years. In the eighties I was lucky enough to find a Raymond Briggs stuffed toy snowman that played the theme that the young boy sings.The story opens a child's imagination; the music is hauntingly beautiful and the video/dvd never disappoints. Many years ago I was able to tape the David Bowie version; it is wonderful.This is intelligent and lovely enough to enchant children of all ages.
2,Too Big,The watch is unfortunately sized more for a man's wrist than a woman. It is exactly the size pictured...the picture wasn't enlarged at all. Very dissapointed.
1,Mixed results-UPDATE 0 for 2,"I have bought two of these twin Colemans. They are very comfortable and easy to inflate/deflate with the pump. One of them has already sprung a slow leak that I was unable to locate. The other is doing fine, but hasn't been used very many times. The reason I bought the twin size is because they seemed to have better ratings from a leak perspective. 12-2012 update: My 2nd one has also developed a slow leak. This happened after about 30 days of total use. Since the beds were used by an adult of average weight, and weren't subjected to any punctures or used as a trampoline, I cannot recommend the product. I will be buying a lay-away bed or cot to replace them. Such a shame, as they really are very comfortable."
2,it leaks!,"My queen size bed didn't fit in my new apartment, so I bought this to use this as a temporary everyday bed for a year. It held up for about 3.5 months before it started slowly leaking. Don't be fooled by the advertising...it's true that the ""Coleman's Airtight System - Advanced Double Lock Valve"" doesn't leak. The VALVE doesn't leak but the ridges (the oval ring things) on top of the bed sure do! I was able to fix the first leak with some superglue to fill the hole, but more leaks just kept creeping up. I suppose for this price, 4 months of continuous use isn't too bad."
4,Great bed,"We've only used the bed twice, but so far so good. It inflates quickly, and doesnt lose much air thru the night. The only con is the bag they give to roll the the bed up when your done. It doesn't hold the bed well."
2,sleep flat in the center or you risk rolling off the bed,"My brother came to visit us last month. We bought this bed for him. It is a twin double high airbed. It looks very comfortable, but it acts like a big bowl with no base rim. On the first night, brother B said the bed is pushing him off from it like an exercising ball. We let the air out a bit and wished he had a good night sleep. On the second night, brother B said he did fine sleeping right in the center, but when he turned to one side of the bed, the other side of the bed tipped up and spit him right out of the bed.It is a comfortable bed, but better get a wider one to prevent the tipping of the bed and spilling of your guest, unless it is your secret intention.Coleman Twin Double-High Quickbed with Electric Pump"
2,burst my bubble,The electric pump cracked two days after having it and the mattress sprung a leak after a week of indoor use.
1,Hope you live near the fire department,"In spite of the fancy settings, this crock-pot has only one heat: ""NUCLEAR"" It keeps liquids boiling whether on the high, low or warm setting. I was pretty sure I had a defective model until I read similar reviews both here and elsewhere. The outside gets extremely hot also. Rival pioneered the idea of the crock-pot years ago. What are they thinking?I'm returning it tomorrow. One star rating only because I'm not allowed to give ""zero."""
3,Has good and bad points,"I like the overall look of this crockpot, particularly the stainless steel that fits in nicely with my stainless steel refrigerator and other appliances; Nice oval shape for a variety of dishes; Easy to use button panel; Removable black ceramic insert is easy to clean and can double as a serving bowl.However, I agree with the reviews submitted for other similar Rival crockpots -- that it gets way too hot. Even on the low setting, the outside is extremely hot to the touch and can cause serious burns, and, after a couple of hours, the contents are bubbling and boiling. Meals are ready several hours before recipes indicate. Requires some experimentation. Yet, I lack crockpot experience overall and this may be typical."
1,If burnt is your flavor...this is the pot for you!,"I have tried numerous recipes and adjusted liquids to have waaaaaay more than what is called for and it still burns everything!!!I even had my mother in law come down and turn it to keep warm at lunch one day, and yep! all was burnt when I got home.I am putting it up for sale.ls/FL"
1,A Very HOT cooker!,Like many other users I too found this slow-cooker to operate at an incredibly high temperature. A chicken and stuffing dish that I made in my old slow cooker turned into a toughened burned mess after less than half the usual cooking time. I ended up removing it from the cooker and trying to salvage it by finishing it in the oven. I would never leave this appliance unattended. It gets incredibly hot to the touch and foods burn/liquids boil. The point of a slow cooker is to be able to prepare foods without constant monitoring. The high temperature of this one necessitates that you repeatedly check it and that you don't leave the house while it's on. Stay away from this product.
1,Cooks too hot,"I totally agree with the other reviewer. This piece of garbage is only good for boiling stuff. It is a dangerous item to leave alone in the house. AND, Rival will do absolutely nothing to help you."
1,Cooks Way Too Hot!!,"I wish I'd come to this site to read the reviews first. I bought this unit, and woke up this morning to beef stew that was a burnt mess, even though I followed the directions in the cookbook that came with the unit. Do not buy this!!"
1,AWFUL PRODUCT!,It cooks way too hot... FIRE HAZARD! Put on LOW and on top of my glass top stove -- the stove top was so hot that it felt like all four burners were on! Couldn't even touch it! All the veggies were mushy and unrecognizable. Chicken was tough and way overcooked! NOT HAPPY at all for $50.00! This could definitely cause a fire! I'm taking it back for a refund because it cannot be used. I emailed Rival a complaint about this product... cannot believe it hasn't been recalled with all the complaints I'm finding online. I want a new crockpot but will check reviews before purchasing another one! AWFUL PRODUCT!
1,Plastic Lid broke after little use,"I am trying to get a replacement lid for this slow cooker and in fact it's a fast cooker. I had it set on 6 hrs and within 4 hrs I lifted the lid and the plastic lid broke (hint: don't buy plastic...stick with glass with no plastic ). I received this as a gift, but i WOULD NOT buy this product again. I am now shopping for a crock pot. Pretty sad."
5,Good to Go,I bought this piece of work for my wife and she just loves it. The food quality and the way it cooks is outstanding.... and did i mention how easy it is to clean and program. This is flawless and I would recommend this to any cooking fanatic...
4,Mine works great!,"I'm baffled by all of the bad reviews for this slow cooker. I have used mine several dozen times without a problem and cooked just about every type of recipe - roasts and vegetables, soups and stews, even lasagna. Yes, the unit does run hot, but it hasn't affected my cooking at all and I have yet to burn anything I'm cooking. The timer is a very nice feature, and the removable crockery makes serving and cleaning a breeze. My only complaint is that the lid rattles and will splatter on the coutner, so I gave it a 4 although it's closer to a 4.5. Maybe I got lucky with my unit, but I love this slow cooker!"
2,Rival Crockpot,"Very disappointed. This pot looks great, but it cooks WAY TOO HOT...even on the lowest setting. The ceramic pot also cracked on my 8th use. I think it was too hot. All the contents leaked out and burned. A waste of money."
1,Cooks too hot,I received this top of the line Rival pot after returning 2 others to them because the new programmable pots were cooking too hot. After returning the first two I requested the old style but they sent this model. I do not recommend buying the programmable models until they work out the temperature problems. Their customer service is great for trying to please but I have given up on Rival and I am trying a competitors pot that got better reviews.
1,Good thing my husband is a firefighter,"I got this crock pot off my registry from my wedding and was so excited to use it along with a crock pot recipe book my friend swore by. Did everything the book told me to do and everything came out a burnt mess. The soup wasn't so bad, but the pasta, chicken, and a casserole were burnt except for a little scoop full in the middle. Huge dissapointment. Everything was cooked on low...This thing doesnt even deserve 1 star."
1,Stays way too hot,"I was very disappointed with my Rival crock pot. It doesn't matter what setting that you use. Even the warm setting makes things boil. It looks nice, but it is just too hot. Stay away from this brand."
3,Hot! Hot! Hot!,"After reading the other reviews of this product, I find that I am not at fault for poor crockpot cooking. It does cook everything super fast and it gets very hot. I am not a seasoned crockpot cooker, so I just figured that I didn't know what I was doing. I guess I won't be buying this one for my mom this Christmas!"
1,Perfect if you need coal for Christmas...,"This thing is terrible. At first I thought it was me, but after reading these reviews I feel so much better. The only thing it produces in charcoal. Sometime there is edible matter in the middle, sometimes it's pure charcoal. They should give me back the cost of the unit, PLUS the cost of all of the food I have wasted, PLUS the cost of the chinese food and pizza I have had to order as a quick replacement!!!"
1,Just one temerature - HIGH. Bad product.,"I only use this crockpot for soups, temp is way too hot for other dishes. I have one with a divided crock which is a great idea for buffets...chili on one side, bean soup on the other. But you have to remember it has no low or warm, just HIGH, so you need to turn it on and off occasionally.I use the smaller crockpot I bought in 1979 to cook things that need more finesse. If there really were a high, low, and warm on this cooker as the company states, it would be a wonderful product. Unfortunately, the company claims are not truthful."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","I was sooooo happy when I read these reviews because I was ready to give up on slow cooking entirely. I have burned EVERYTHING I've ever cooked in this- I thought it was me! I'm actually a great cook and used to make fun of slow cooking, but with a family it made sense.I bought this because i had started with a smaller version and I wanted a larger crock pot with the 10 hour setting. I had some success with the smaller RIVAL, but it was simply too small to do anything except reheat soup. I thought I'd try this one since it was bigger, had more features, etc. WRONG.I promise I'm not exaggerating- after 6 hours in this thing (at the 10 hour setting) everything has been burned beyond recognition- I was told it was impossible to burn anything in a crock pot. WRONG.Seriously, get another one. I'm online now searching for a different brand that hopefully won't set my house on fire."
1,Horrible Crock Pot!,"I've used a crock pot for years and love it! I decided mine was too small and I wanted to upgrade. This ""SLOW COOKER"" BOILS everything! In a matter of an hour on LOW, my roasts are boiling. I hate this thing! I contacted the company and told them because I thought mine was defective, but everyone is saying the same thing. This product should be recalled by the company."
1,Burns everything,I was beginning to think I was the problem with this crockpot. Everything I cooked burned. So I came here to read others and feel a lot better now that I know it's not me. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Very Disappointed,"I have used slow cookers for over 20 years, and this is the third one I have ever bought. I wanted a larger capacity and stainless steel look. I have never been able to use this cooker and leave the house. The food boils up at low (recommended cooking temperature) and steam spits everywhere. I'm back to using my old 15 year old Rival (smaller but totally reliable)."
4,A decent case.,"I bought this for my fiance's father, and he really seems to enjoy the case. It is huge, but that makes it very easy to work with inside. I can't think of one disadvantage of it. Definitely recommended."
3,Hot but not as comfortable,Hot looking shoes but not as comfortable as I thought they would be. Very true to size.
2,Pleased at first,When I first got this lamp I was very pleased with it. I've now had it about 5 weeks and it has broken. The longer I had it the harder it got to turn on until yesterday the lamp part broke away from the arm.It is very disappointing because I liked the light and at first I felt it was a very good deal. There are plastic parts that won't stand up to usage.
2,"Arrived broken, poor quality","This is nice little lamp but is mostly plastic and arrived with the ""head"" snapped off. I dont have the time to return it so i fixed it and now it works fine but i wouldnt buy another as its poor quality and clearly cant stand up to much heavy use."
1,just bad,She does not have a firm grasp on the concepts of winframe. I am surprised there is a report that she is writting another book. Her mistakes are numerous and I know why there are soo many paper CCA's and MCSE. Visit the real world laura
3,OUTDATED,"I'm a Terminal Server 4.0/Citrix administrator, and I picked up the book for additional information. This book is for NT 3.5 users. It's a good book, don't get me wrong, but I found it to be ideally suited for NT 3.5. The GUI is different (what about registry settings too?), and that's enough reason to look for an updated book. If I had an NT 3.5 box with Citrix Metaframe, I could use this book. With all the additional network engineering, troubleshooting, and training duties I have at work, I have very little time to decipher correlations between NT 3.5 & 4.0."
2,An honest and frank review from an exprienced user,"I have been using Citrix's WinFrame for about two years now in an administrative capacity. I began using v1.6 and then v1.7 and have seen a whole host of issues raised throughout my experience with the product. Trefil's book certainly covers the basics in more or less complete fashion, albeit in a less logically organised manner than would be ideal. But it does cover most of what a new user/administrator needs to be aware of at the outset. It in no way attempts to delve into what 'really' goes on in the day to day troubleshooting process or provide a 'resource kit' style coverage, as with Microsoft's Windows Resourse Kits - if one purchases the book for this reason, they will be disappointed. However I found the book insightful and useful just the same. I would like to have seen more concise troubleshooting methodologies included."
3,Good Book,"This is good book, however, I agree with the comment that the layout of the material is a little unorganized. Also some of the tips are outdated already. For instance, the Exchange tips only work with Exchange 5.0 not 5.5 and the NWADMIN tips only work with Netware 4.1 not 4.11 and the author does not make this clear. Also, the Winstation Configuration and Winstation Administration Utilities are not covered. But all-in-all, even with these problems I still found it to be a good book with some good tips and good study material for the certification exam."
4,fragile pop ups,"My daughter was fascinated with dinosaurs and chose this book herself. It has beautiful illustrations and fabulous pop-ups. It also has a lot of dinosaur facts on every page and pictures many different dinosaurs (chasmosaurus,xenotarsosaurus). The pop-ups however, are very fragile - one ripped away from the book the very first day (she was 3 1/2 at the time and a careful child)."
2,Not for jewelry or precise measure needs,"I had to return this item but the seller was nice about it! Found the item was not very accurate and could only weigh full or half carat/gram/etc weight. Also, the item was not well constructed and was not shipped as quickly as expected."
4,Awesome!,"This is a fabulous collection of Automatic and Monster videos, really nice. I especially like all the little mini films in between videos. My favorite is the one where all the sounds keep building and overlapping and getting louder and louder and louder and then...silence. Nothing but silence. It's cool. I also think the videos are great. You can really see the shift between albums and styles, which is great for fans of a band that is always reinventing themselves, but retaining that great rock-and-roll quality. Some of my favorites? ""Drive,"" ""Man on the Moon,"" ""The Sideinder Sleeps Tonite,"" ""Everybody Hurts,"" ""Nightswimming,"" ""Bang and Blame,"" and ""Crush with Eyeliner,"" which is just plain weird! All of the videos have that haunting R.E.M. essence (did I spell that right?) to them and this video is a must have for any R.E.M. fan."
4,A Great Bargain,"One of the all time classic comic strips is reprinted here in a hardback color edition that publishes every Sunday strip from 1905-14. While the reproduction of some of the pages is slightly blurry and faded which takes away some from McKay's very detailed artwork, the sheer amount of material one gets here for such an inexpensive price makes this a must have if you are at all interested in comic strips. Get this and discover why McKay is regarded as one of the masters."
5,"Winsor McCay, an artist for all times","Paging through this book is a completely humbling experience. Today, anyone with even a modicum of Photoshop chops can wow the folks back home with glitzy effects or totally synthesized environments and interfaces. (--Not that that is entirely a bad thing.) But long before computers, Winsor McCay was making vivid, fevered, fully realized jaw-dropping dreams with india ink, brush and a scratch pen. (Leave it to the psychedelic 60s to rediscover this trippy gem of the comics.) And it isn't just the narrative content, as singular as that is, that begs our attention: Even in an age of artists like J. C. Coll, Franklin Booth, Willy Pogany, Charles Dana Gibson, Rose O'Neill and other masters of illustration, Winsor McCay was a titanic genius.The obsessive level of McCay's detail cries out for a larger sized reproduction of these great Sunday Pages. But for the price, this collection is unbeatable."
4,A greta purchase!,"Many Winsor Macay's fans complain about the reduction of the original pages an lack of quality of the colors. But we must see that this edition collects ALL SUNDAYS of this beautiful/artistic character for a very reasonable price and the ""wasted"" colors are reproduction of the poor coloring from that time(the beginning of last century!).For the nostalgic children above 40years old(like me)it is a marvelous gift. Besides,the paper is of excellent quality,just like the hardbound cover nd it has a nice dustjacket. For me it was a great find and is highly recomended."
4,Lots of snow fun.,"This is a cute little doll. I love shoes on the Bratz dolls, they don't fall off like Barbie shoes. Everything is made very well."
4,Typical USB Hub Really,"Sits on the desk well, easy to get to USB plugs, charging ports don't work when the PC is off (minus one point), external audio plugs I don't use. Good solid USB hub, too bad the offline charging doesn't work for my iPhone and iPod."
5,Serves the purpose,"Package content:- 4 USB Port Hub- Stand- AC power cable- Audio pass cable- Microphone pass cable- USB connectorThe product has a 4 USB port hub with LEDs displaying which ones are in-use. And the hub has to be conected using 4 wires - the power cable to a power outlet and the USB, audio and mic cables to the CPU. The cables are long enough to be connected to the CPU kept below a desk.So far, I have not seen any reduction in data tranfer speeds when 4 USB devices are connected to the hub and being used at the same time.It is light in weight and serves the purpose very well. Usually, USB hubs are used with work desktops which you will either never turn off or put on sleep mode or not use it for anything when away from it. So I don't see the importance of it to be able to charge phones when it's turned off."
1,Just a leaky mess - no flight ever succeeded,"We tried this several times, with no success, other than vinegar leaking out the ""o"" ring. What a huge disappointment after much anticipation. (son received as a gift at his birthday party) Would NOT spend a dollar on this. Would give ZERO stars if I could."
1,Very Disappointed Young Scientists,"We followed the instructions to the letter, but instead of a great lift off, it was literally a fizz. The rocket leaked at the point where the body attached to the fins and never built up enough pressure to launch - it just foamed at the seal."
3,Rocket,The concept is good. Step away quickly after you shake the rocket. Vinegar and Baking Soda are needed. The rocket goes approx. 20' into the air.
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money. Terrible design. First the O ring leaked then it always leaked from the bottom. Worked maybe twice out of twenty tries. Grandsons very disappointed!
2,"Good idea, very poor design","The idea behind this rocket is excellent: Mix vinegar and soda to generate gas, and launch this rocket into the sky.The problem is the very poor design of the rocket: First, the rocket itself is made of two parts which screw into one another. Unfortunately, the seal between them is bad, so you either have some of the gas leaking out of the seal or, if you try to screw them harder, are liable to break the rocket (both happened to us). Furthermore, the seal between the launchpad and the rocket is poor, so again, either gas leaks or the rocket breaks."
4,Great for cheap strobes,"I got these for about 27 dollars each. Bought two of them. They're fine for very basic, easy to use strobes. Right now it looks like they're going for 45... don't jump on it. Wait until they come down. I moved on to LED strobes anyway"
1,Good for two minutes!,"Either a faulty lamp or faulty strobe... Either way, I purchased this for a fund raiser event and tested the day it arrived. It was on for nearly two minutes when it quit working. Contacted local businesses to locate a lamp without luck (DFW area)! Checked other outlets to make sure it wasn't a power issue. Had topurchase a new strobe (american DJ) locally for the event. Now stuck with a unit that either has a bad lamp or circuit is faulty!VERY DISAPPOINTED to say the least! Would NOT porches again (unir brand or seller )"
5,1976 Autocourse formula one review,"I own quite a few of these autocourse formula one annuals and I love them. They tell you everything you will ever want to know about each season, from each team, each race, practice, qualifing, race reviews, and times are detailed here. Plus they are illistrated with houndreds of amazing photos that are only seen in these books. If you are a formula one fan you must get these books, amazon.com has some of the best priced books you wont find anywhere else. Buy this you will not be disappointed. These autocourse books are true formula one treasure chests. If you only can get one of these books then I recommend this one (1976 autocourse formula one) season. It was one of the most amazing seasons in F1 history. Niki Lauda seamed a shoe in for the '76 championship, but a crash at the German gp changed that. What followed was a great comeback from Niki Lauda that is made for the movies. Great book, great season."
4,"""A Posturing of Fools""","Well-written prose upon ambition and relationships; a must read for anyone who wants to carry themselves with more confidence and to discover the insight of ""snobbery."" Robertson paints perfectly the Greenbrier and the surround West Virginia countryside. The characters are relatable, and their emotions real. The reader is transferred into the mind of narrator."
5,Healing Reading,"Toni Lynn Wood truly out does herself with this incredible collaboration with her Spirit Family. Toni Lynn's writing style is so easy to understand and absorb. Although in the previous Living in Both Worlds books, Toni's spirit family is introduced to the readers - Piercing the Veil provides a more personal introduction and welcoming to Toni's family. I found Piercing the Veil to be an incredible educating experience about spirit guides, mediums and piercing the veil between the earth plane and our loved ones in the spirit world. I take comfort in knowing that my loved ones are so near me and that when we die there is still so much more to come."
4,"Good, short and simple book","This book is short and sweet. My family read this aloud in preparation for our first backpacking trip into bear country, Yellowstone National Park. It didn't take long to get through the book as it is small and easy to read. I felt sufficiently educated about how to safely camp in bear country by spending a little time in the book. I'm sure that there are other books that have additional information that would be interesting that you won't find here, but I believe that this book will give you the basic information to feel confident undertaking a camping trip in bear country. I served our purpose well."
5,As much advice as anyone can give you.,In this tiny book is as much advice as anyone can give a person who is headed for Grizzly Brown Bear country. Read it before heading into the woods but keep it in your backpack while camping for review.
2,Poor brush life and no service parts,"Pump does the job, but short brush life even with an added cooling fan. In service one year and must now be replaced. No brushes offered in parts kit. Since the rest of the pump is robust, the failure mode is always brush life. New brushes would put this pump right back into service. How about an extra set of brushes with each new pump?"
4,Pumps works great,"Pump works great. The only inconvenience is that it didn't come pre wired with an electrical cord and switch and I had to supply those. Other than that, works great."
4,good little pump,"This pump replaced a shallow well pump I was using for water pressure, it has more consistent pressure and uses way less electricity, on the down side it does make a bit more noise. I've been using this pump daily for over a year now, so it has proven it's self."
3,"Hot, Big and Gorgious","I was using a Gefore FX 5200 and needless to say the difference between the two cards is huge. Performance is great, the image quality is absolutely superb(I am playing 'Guild Wars' on a 17"" lcd running maximum settings with 4x anti aliasing).I have several problems with this card:1. It is big. it just barely fits in my motherboard, and it actually touches the RAM.2. It is getting very hot - when I play with full settings on, the card starts to heat and make annoying beeps. I have solved this temporarily by blowing a house fan on it(just until I get a water cooling system).3. I cant seem to get a temperature reading for this card. maybe its just me.Amazon - Great handling, shipment very fast(came after 4 days with a super free saving). I would not hesitate to use this site again.system specs:Athlon xp 2500+@2.07Abit nf72*256 ddr 400 cas 3philips lcd 17"" 25msMaxtor IDE 120 GBlousy PSU and case(could be the cause for the overheat)"
4,Why This Cd is Worth 4 Stars,"When my girlfriend returned from florida and gave me this cd i was so excited. i had already heard taste in men...and i loved it. well i quickly unwrapped it and to my delight i heard taste in men, than after came on this AMAZING song, Robert Palmer's Johnny and Mary. Johnny and Mary is possibly the best song i have ever heard Placebo sing. it's why i rated the cd what i rated it."
2,"Dull, overlong trifle","I have read many books by the esteemed Dr. A, and this is certainly one of the weakest of them all. A none too surprising tour of a book & authors convention with workaday characters presumably based on real people (but who cares). The only lively character is Asimov himself, who is portrayed as lecherous, gluttonous and overbearing, tho still lovable. 90% of the interrogation by the amateur sleuth is dull and irrelevant and serves only as parsley to cover up the (miniscule) actual clues. But even here, the clues are introduced as clumsily as in his Lucky Starr on Mars, where out of nowhere a character flashes what turns out to be the murder weapon. Asimov wrote much better mysteries in ^A Whiff of Death^ and especially ^The Caves of Steel^, not to mention some of his superlative science fiction. Skip this one."
5,A tale of morality from Serbia,"In this brief tale, a greedy shopkeeper uses his power and cunning to outwit an honest man from the countryside. Eventually,the tables are turned by a wise judge. It is a good morality tale and can be the beginning of a good conversation with young people about greed, honesty and wisdom. Harold Bergson's detailed drawings of ancient Serbia are delightful. Take a little time for this little tale. It's a winner."
3,teen yoga,"Teen YogaI was hoping the view a video about teens practicing yoga. This is not the case. I felt the practice was too difficult, and unrealistic for most teens."
1,No DVD in the Case,"The packaging was great, just no DVD inside the case. No response to my email & the item is now out of stock. First time I've ever had a problem."
5,Great Video,Excellent dvd.Also available in a download for lesser $$.Great tutorial.I only wish MS. Jang were an English rather than Continental style knitter for the tutorials.It is definitely worth the money!
5,THIS CD IS AWESOMELY GOOD,"The title track,""Dont Haffi Dread"" is a true reggae classic, and one of the most penetratingly heartfelt songs I've ever heard. But every song on this disc is good stuff, and greatly brought to life by the fastastic voices of Peter and Roy ""Gramps"" Morgan. This is reggae at its most conscious and harmonic best, and I highly recommend it."
3,in comparison to modern day reggae bands it's pretty good,"I'm a hardcore reggae fan and being from England, the home of Lovers Rock and that power house band STEEL PULSE....I might be a bit too hard on this band(Morgan Heritage) I think that they have a far way to go, to be considered among the likes of Steel Pulse and Third World. However, even though their music might be a touch different, most die hard reggae fans prefer listening to music styled on the late 70's and 80's. Try Steel Pulse's albums from the early years to understand where I'm coming from."
1,Vermin Infested pads from CHINA,"Months later, I am still having post-traumatic stress from finding a curly tailed smashed mouse within the layers of a Gridlock pad...but I am happy to tell you that I have discovered many USA made under-pads made for humans which are larger and cheaper than these filthy, China made pads.I purchased directly from Dig it, and when I spoke to them they were as unconcerned with this incident as the Chinese manufacturers of the pet food ingredient that killed thousands of our countries dogs and cats a couple of years ago, so I wouldn't be surprised if these pads also contained carcinogenic ingredients - these people just don't care - their one and only goal is to get as much cash out of our pockets as possible with as little expenditure to them as possible, no matter who it KILLS!!!!"
4,Nice for the Price!!,"Ok, I have been using these for a few months now. I can not find a better product at a better price. I buy them 100 at a time and my Yorkie uses them religiously (are you allowed to say that for a pee pad?) Anyway I have tried other brands but this one is the best bang for your buck. I have not seen them on sale but when I do I will stock up for the year. Good girl Bella, Good girl!"

3,Home design,Fairly easy to use but certainly not for professionals. We've used it mostly to check the rearrangement of rooms during our renovation.
4,Handy to have,I purchased my Z3 used. It had no handbook. This volume has the answers to some of the secrets of the BMW Z3. Worth the investment.
4,Working with a Service Manual,"Any one who owns a BMW Z3 should have this book on their shelf. Whether you do your own work or not, this book is a wealth of information. Just knowing how to change some items (bulbs, fuses, etc.) in various locations on the car, will save you the cost of the book."
3,not as good as expected,"Other drivers can tell you more in the forums, than this book does.Although it is well illustrated en written."
5,Excellent book!,This book is excellent.. All the info you need to start fixing your z3. I myself have a 2000 M Coupe and this book help me fix some of the things that requires step-by-step guidance. I recommened this book for fixit yourself car guys out there.Jeff
1,Not a very good manual!,These Bentley manuals are way over hyped. Not much good in my opinion. Lots of errors and stuff not covered that should be. Have hardly used it due to being nearly worthless for anything you don't already know how to do.
3,Best available but lacking,"This better than all others but lacking in a great deal. Items are difficult to find, some photos are not very well defined. I have searched for several months but still found nothing better. I have a 1999 Z3. Photos are small, so though the item might be listed, the photo does not should enough of the view for you to identify what you are looking for in many cases. I usually end up going online to a parts manual diagram and then returning to the manual for directions which are pretty good."
5,A Must-Have,"This manual is a must-have for a Z3 owner who wants to have complete information about their car and perhaps do some maintenance or repair work. Hard-bound, thick, well-organized and nicely illustrated, it's a pleasure to use."
4,BMW Z3 Service manual,"Probably more detailed than required for the average car buff, however all car mechananics are discussed.Pictures to help identify specific components are good.Its what a mechaninc would expect from a service manual.I would recommend."
3,The only game in town but lacking both in content as well as construction,"When I needed to replace the brakes on my 2001 BMW Z3 I was distressed to find that the only manual available for the 2001 BMW Z3 was a $75.00+ Bentley Shop Manual. I ordered the manual [[ASIN:B000AP64PK BMW Z3 Service Manual: 1996-2002] and went it arrived I turned to the section on brakes. The pictures were great but the descriptions left more than a little to be desired. While you could see a picture of it, the manual did not tell you you needed a 7mm allen wrench to remove the brake calipers. To add insult to injury when I laid the book flat, the binding was so cheap that the page that I was looking at just came loose! Not the sort of quality you might wish for in a $75.00 book!"
2,DIACETYL,I Have been buying this product in Safeway since January with no Diacetyl added. When I got my order I was unpleasently surprised to get to get an older shipment with Diacetyl still being used. I will think twice before ordering food products online in the future.
1,Trans fat anybody?,"This product tastes ok, but inexpensive trans fat is used and it adds up quickly. I will stick with popcorn brands that care enough not to add oils that will not clog my arteries and theaten to shorten my life span."
4,Dan's review,"This a very good,tasty and easy to digest popcorn. Tast is better than other brands too."
2,Unrealistic,"I found this book to be too unrealistic to enjoy fully. True, it's Christian Fiction literature, but everyone in this book that has any relation to the main characters is a Christian, too. It's just too cozy that the business partner, doctor, laywer and judge share the same faith as Tess and her friends. I agree with another reviewer that the dialogue is too unrealistic and stilted - it seems forced somehow. I'm aware that infertility can be heartbreaking and a real cross to bear for some families. As tragic as it is to be unable to conceive a child, it took Tess well over 80 pages to stop whining about it. That coupled with her inconsideration toward her husband's desire for a child (naturally conceived or adopted) just irritated me."
4,Nice Reference Book but not a good 1st book on the Rising,This is a good book to read for those who are very interested in the uprising. It is NOT a good idea to read this book before reading a current and comprehensive book about the Easter Rising. This would be a good follow up to either Coogan's or De Rosa's books on the subject. It was written and compiled by the Irish Times who was decisively against the uprising and this is very clear in some of the analysis in the book. It also has some inaccuracies and errors that can be explained by both its political prejudice and the proximity in time to the Rising in which it was compiled. It is a mandatory book for those of us who are hopelessly obsessed with those events so long ago in 1916
3,Works but with a price,"The Glaesel Ebony mute is pretty simply to install, but in time it will slip off little by little.. As for it's job, it does actually mute with a more bassy sound. The downside is that it will ""hide"" your mistakes made without the mute and the Ebony will stain the bridge black after a week or 2 of use. If you want to preserve your bridge then I suggest trying a different product."
2,Disappointing,"At times I wasn't sure if this book was about the Yukon Quest race or the author mourning the loss of the great white north.There wasn't enough detail about the race, perhaps because Balazar didn't run the race... he hopped from checkpoint to checkpoint and drank beer. Now that's racing!"
5,Excellent escape from the busy city,"I really enjoyed the book. The emotions this book brings out make it well worth the read. My puppy ""Rugby"" may soon have some siblings on the way, siblings that pull sleds.A must read for anyone who likes dogs and/or travel/adventure."
4,"Wonderful characters, fascinating lifestyle",Enjoyed the book and the intimate views of the people and lifestyle that create the dog sled culture. Set on the background of the Alaska/ Yukon north filled with excitement and scenes of the northern lights. This book is heart pounding and heart filling.
2,Not sure if it's anything special- does not dissolve,"I purchased this products because I've read that this ""type"" of probiotic is very effective. I can't really draw any conclusions at this point. I will say this, the front of the label should say powder on it. I purchased it assuming that these were tablets. The reason why this is relevant is that as a powder, it dissolves very very very poorly. It basically just cakes in water and oftentimes sticks to the spoon that I mix with as well as the sides of the cup I drink from. I would NOT recommend the powder form until they develop a more dissolvable form. Perhaps the tablet/capsule is more effective.Good luck :)"
5,Very good for beginners,This book is very good for beginners in extrusion. I needed to learn about this subject starting from zero knolledge about it (but a good general technical background) and it was very usefull to me.
2,Mounting tape does not stick,"This product is similar to ones I have purchased for my two cats in the past, with one exception...the plastic on the back is too slick for the tape to stick! I ended up using another brand of foam tape to adhere it flat against the wall, because it would not stick at all when bent around a corner. The cats tried to use it but it didn't have the same effect. I will try to find another brand of corner comb in the future!"
2,Could be good for some cats,"It's not really a good comb, so even if my cat chose to use this product, I can't see it helping. Maybe on raelly long haired cats it would help with the grooming issue. I could see that it would be something a cat would love, though. Mine doesn't, and that's unfortunate. He figured out how to get the catnip out pretty quickly, and doesn't give a rip about the rest of it now. Unfortunately, I'm scared to take it down because I don't want it to peel off the paint, so we're stuck with an ugly thing that doesn't get used."
3,"Decent, with modification","As others have stated, this doesn't stick with the included adhesive strips. It also doesn't happen to fit any corners in my mobile home. So I just took one of the panels and tacked it (small nails) directly to the wall the cats always brush against. When I find a good spot for the other one, I'll do the same."
3,doesn't stay,"The item seems nice, but as stated in previous reviews the tape does not stick. It's stuck on the wall very well but does not hold the comb up. I even tried glue on the item and put it on the tape now securely stuck to my wall. It held for about 2 hours before it fell and that's without the cat using it. I hope my kitten will start using it once I get it hung up."
2,Sticking on wall is a disaster,"First and foremost, I've never seen something so stick-resistant in my life. The two-sided adhesives which come with the product hardly stick to the wall, and do not stick to the back of the comb at all. I've used everything from command clip adhesive, duct tape, and even super glue and none will stick to the shiny plastic. The best solution to the problem is to sand down all of the shiny plastic to make it rough, then super glue some two-way foam tape to the comb, then place on the wall. Also, the two combs are removable, and easily come off when our cat tugs on them. So, I would recommend the same sanding/super glue strategy to adhere the combs to the rest of the plastic frame (zip ties also work ok).With all that said, our cat LOVED the comb for the first day (the day when it was falling apart) and haven't gotten him to touch it since fixing it. Overall, I would NOT recommend this product unless you are a handyman/woman and your cat is desperate for a wall comb."
3,The opium of my cats!,"I wanted something my cats could rub against since my two calicos like alot of head scratching and often rub their faces and necks against the wall and I have noticed it has started to leave black marks.I hoped this would add as a bit of a distraction to them. The catnip provided has an effect upon my cats like crack or opium (and this from cats who have tried a variety of catnips available)! I stuffed some 'nip (street name for catnip) inside the little pockets at the bottom and they took to it like addicts! However, I have one problem and this has already been mentioned which is the sticky stuff provided doesnt hold up very well. I am going to try and use other sticky materials such as fun-tak mounting putty to see if it adds some traction (UPDATE: it did tremendously-for awhile but then it fell down again. I used tape and this might not be the most appealing and aesthetic option for most people)(and of course I took a photo so others could see it in action)"
2,Fell off of wall,"Well, maybe I missed something in the information but I installed it on a painted wood door casing and it promptly fell off onto floor."
4,"Cat loves it, wall does not","My cat loves this and she hates being brushed, so it is a good way to avoid those bites and growls when they get overstimulated. The thing is already falling off the wall after barely 3 hours of being stuck there -- and my cat playing with it for about 15 minutes total. I am thinking of getting some other form of adhesive that will be more durable."
4,my cat loves this thing,my cat loves the thing.... so i like it for her but the way to attatch it sucks. i improvised with velcro and its fine now. the shipping was fast and im happy with the purchase
3,I wish my cat liked this more.,"In the product's defense, my cat is ridiculously picky when it comes to things being placed where she normally rubs her face against. I thought she'd love this, as I wanted to put it exactly where she usually ""grooms"" her whiskers, however she doesn't really go near it much, not that I've seen. I'm not blaming the weak mounting stick'ems they put in the box, but my cat was somewhat interested when we first put it up for her, and after it fell, she hasn't touched it. We've since gotten better quality mounting tape and really stuck it to the wall well...however, I think she's over it.Good product, though. Well made, nice brushes."
2,won't stick to wall,"I bought two of these and they arrived yesterday. On the first, the sticky pads you are given to put it on the wall did stick. Until the first use and it fell off. On the second, the sticky pads were dried out upon arrival and weren't even sticking to the comb, least wise the wall.So I got out my Goop adhesive and tried to glue it to the wall. As soon as I let go, it slid down and off the wall.So I got out my E6000 adhesive and tried again. Same results.So I got out some duct tape and glued it again and this time taped it. After a few hours I removed the tape on one and it actually stayed up, until a cat used it. I left the tape on over night on the other and took it off this morning. It's still on the wall, but no ones used it so far.End result...cat's love it, but it probably will have to be nailed permanently to the wall for them to use it."
2,Fails in one very important feature: sticking to surfaces,"This product is exactly what you'd expect, other than one very important feature: it doesn't stick to walls or doors, which is sort of the whole point. I don't mean your cat will eventually rub it loose if your cat's a really enthusiastic and forceful rub-against-er. I mean, you'll stick this to the corner or thew all or door and it will fall off the first time your cat touches it.Other than adhesiveness, the product is solid enough to work. If you have some alternate plan for how to affix this to a surface (glue? screws? magnets? hammer and nails?) you might be able to make it work. I haven't thrown ours away, though my cat has never been able to rub up against it for more than a second. Seriously, if I didn't care at all about the wall, I'd just glue it. I'm holding onto it, in case I get some kind of clever idea for making it stick to the wall like it's supposed to."
1,Too flimsy,"This thing is sitting on the floor in 3 pieces right now, again. The pads are not fixed to the frame and come off with the slightest touch...like when your cat rubs on it! then the frame also doesnt stay on the wall with the included double sided tape. I bought 3M stuff that should work better but the pads will still fall off. My cat loves this thing so I have to find a way to make it work but as is it doesn't."
3,"ITS OK, BUT....","The sticky tabs that came with the product doesnt work well. After a couple of rubs from my 16 LBS kitty, it was knocked off the wall. The product wasn't too solid, kinda flimsy, so the tabs couldn't hold it flat against the wall. I ended up buying super velcro tabs, which worked well, that is until kitty knocked it off, again. But it did last a couple of months this time. He likes it and uses it alot. If I didn't have to keep pinning it back on the wall, it could've gotten a 4 rating, and if it wasn't a flimsy rubber-plastic-like material, it would've gotten a 5. The catnips included doesn't do anything for kitty, and he's a catnip-junkie! I would say don't waste your time putting catnip in the groomer, just give it to him in a regular catnip toy, it didn't increase him using the groomer."
3,What you'd expect,"The product is what it is and does what it does. I was looking for a cat toy like this for the 'right' price. I found something I liked here. My cat doesn't think much of it yet, she's slow to warm up to new things. (I also should have hung it a little lower and used the catnip that she prefers, but she should come around after she has a little while to sniff at it."
4,pot of sound variety,"When I first got this CD after compulsively watching the movie several times over, I have to admit that I was a little bummed that not all of the songs I was expecting to hear were there. Over time it really grew on me and I have been quite please with the CD. I've picked up more of the music of the different bands featured on it. It's a great choice for someone who likes to keep a nice variety of sounds swimming in her ears. It has given me a taste of artists that I wouldn't normally have stumbled upon otherwise. See the movie if you want a fun & funky chick-flick. If it gets you revved you can expect to be dancing, hopping, bobbing & lipsynching to the soundtrack!"
4,worth a read ....,"On the plus side this short novella kept me interested and moved very quickly, through many years and even several Countries. The book was funny and Brendan is an interesting character . However, Brendan struck me as a bit too detached and matter-of-fact when recounting some of the terrible things that he and his children endured.It was almost as if he were speaking about somebody else and was in denial of any emotional damage to any of the Dakapa Adventure Club members.Elliana is TOO evil and I think that the story could have used characters that had a little more depth and complexity."
5,Mr Brady Meets Cathy Bates,"Tom Whelan strikes a chord through his frank assessment of marriage, divorce and parenthood in a witty, yet insightful manner. This book uniquely blends laughter along with empathy for Brendan McPhelan as he struggles through the mise of an evil, ill tempered woman while cleverly discovering ways to bond with his children and keep tradition alive. An endearing view of a father's love for his children and desperation to maintain stability. Guaranteed to make you laugh!"
5,Dakapa Hankbook,"Must Reading. An amazing story of a father's love for his children and a scary story about the court's of the good old USA. If you want a book that will make you read it until you are finished and like to laugh and cry at the same time, then you have found nirvana."
1,FATWA 2006-YOU CANT HIDE FROM US MR. WHELAN,WE TOLD YOU SIX MONTHS AGO THAT THIS TRASH THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN IS AN INSULT AND WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.AGAIN WE DEMAND-DESTROY EVERY COPY OF THIS NONSENCE (THE DAKAPA HANDBOOK) AND STOP TRYING TO PUBLISH YOUR NEW HILARIOUS MEMOIR (DELIVERING THE BONE AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE SOON)OR ELSE ALLAH WILL HAVE HIS REVENGE ON YOU !!
1,Warning- offensive material,"I believe that the target audience for this book must be woman haters and those who feel that the Jerry Springer show is high culture. Do the other reviewers truly see nothing offensive about this book? Is it now considered acceptable to make fun of victims of domestic abuse? And foreigners? And poor children? And the mentally ill? And Gypsies? And the celebration of Martin Luther Kings birthday? Not to mention police officers, judges,and school administrators.This is a very coarse book written by someone who seems to have some kind of agenda. The book has a promising premise but the author did not win me over despite his desperate attemps to do so. The writing is mediocre at best and the author seems to try to make up for this with one-liners, none of which I found funny in the least.Several of his fawning reviewers have asked for more books from Tom Whelan. I for one would prefer that he concentrate on real estate."
4,"Fast ,Furious,and Funny","Interesting,outside the box chronicle of divorce from a segment of the population that doesnt usually write books. Clever story,wry and sarcastic,with touches of sadness and joy."
5,"Dakapa: Inspirational, A huge hit for Whelan","A witty, heartwarming, hilarious account of a dad's journey to save his relationship with his children through a difficult divorce. Parents will be inspired by this account of a dad's resourceful and unrelenting tactics to be with his children through a terrible time. I will never look at Easter Egg hunts again without a smile and a laugh. A must read, again and again, for any parent who is willing to go the distance for their children. Bravo!Laurie Paul Duddy, MA, BCBA and mom"
5,Love this book!,"This is such a unique book. Unfortunately my son got it as a gift when he was still a toddler and it's not in such great shape now. But he loves it so much that we are ordering another one.I can see why another reviewer said the tabs are difficult to manipulate, but I found that I could help my son with anything he couldn't manage."
4,Wedding Shoes,The shoes arrived in a timely manner and look exactly like they do in the picture. I was looking for something simple to wear with my wedding dress and these will be perfect. Thanks!
3,,"Morgul covers as many bases as possible with All Dead Here, at times it succeeds and at times it simply sounds average. Morgul sounds like it could be the bastard child of Arcturus and Dimmu Borgir, it manages to be more adventurous than the former and more exciting than the latter and it's obvious that it has an obvious desire to stand out from the rest and be its own entity, but it seems like Morgul is still trying to find who it really is here, despite its many years of service in the underground. The title track is a definite highlight, with its haunting piano intro, which is totally mesmerizing. The album also succeeds in the way it delivers variety with its black metal inclinations, melodically symphonic segments, different vocal variations, somber atmospherics and some parts that tend to sound a bit industrial. But ultimately, it just doesn't achieve a high level of memorability, although many of the tracks do have a degree of catchiness."
2,"An okay book, but I feel there are better ones out there","For a basic overview of guitar playing, this book does the trick, but the examples and explanations are not up to par. The CD is okay, but annoying because it all goes too quickly. I learned more from the Mel Bay Chord diagrams than from this book which supposedly explains guitar playing. A good fingerpicking section, but forget about their lead guitar sections, just a bunch of scales, no explanations or anything."
2,Only Fair,Introduces topics without prior explanation. Little theory on how to apply the content. There's better books out there.
4,"NIce,rugged rack","Received my rack and as stated by previous reviewers the packaging by Valley is horrible.Box was all beat up and the carrier was a little scratched,but hey it's a cargo rack not a show piece.About the only disappointment was that after just one night out in the rain rust started forming where the mesh screen is tack welded to the bottom of the frame.I just cleaned it up,but hopefully this won't be an on-going chore and it won't rust out in a year or two."
3,hitch rack,need to be a little stronger in the middle if you stand on it for anything.. nice rack other then that for the price..
3,Poorly Packed,"Poorly packed, metal pieces rubbed against each other during transport and now I have to re-paint it before I even use it (or it will start rusting first time it rains). Very heavy too, remember to subtract the weight of this carrier from your tongue weight capacity to figure if you can really haul 500 lbs."
3,Made in China,"When calling manufacturer they say it is made in the usa, but after purchasing customer found that it is labeled in China. So, this item maybe assembled in the US."
5,Awesome Cargo Carrier,We have been renting a small UHaul to travel from VA to MS in order to keep space for everyone in the car. We purchased this one before our trip this year and used it instead. It was awesome! Very easy to install and load. Allowed for the back door of the vehicle to still open and for the dog to get in and out of the back easily even with it fully loaded. Reasonably priced and definitely well worth the money!
2,Does not work on a 2009 Subaru forester,This would be a nice basket if you could actually fold it up. We have a 2009 Subaru Forester and its not possible to fold the basket because it hits the bumper. Save a few bucks and get the straight one.
2,Shoddy Customer Service,I can't review this product fully because it was missing parts when it arrived. So I have not been able to fully assemble the unit. I called Valley's customer service department and the person on the phone seemed sure that all the parts were there and that I just didn't know what I was talking about. After going back and forth for fifteen minutes he finally agreed that a part was missing and took down my information. It has been one month to the day that I placed the order and I still have not received the part. I've made numerous attempts to call them by phone and I get voicemail every time. I also sent an email that has not been answered either.
2,Packaging damage,"I don't know how to rate the product itself, since it is a gift and my husband hasn't yet opened it. However, the box arrived busted in several places with one end completely open, so I am hoping that the product itself is not damaged and that there are no missing pieced. I will update after Christmas."
4,Great Way to Add Volume,"I love having this! I've used this on several long trips now and cant tell you how much it helps to free up all the leg room in the van. Keep a couple things in mind:1. This is heavy. A strong man can put it in place and take it off, but most of the time it takes two to get the holes lined up and the hitch lock in.2. Folding up is way worth it! Every time I went to a park for a tournament I dropped off my load and then someone would need something from a store. The ability to fold this up makes this hitch stand out.3. You'll need some heavy duty tools to put this together. Some of the bolts have to be tightened to a certain torque. I took it to my mechanic who put it together for me. I recommend you consider that unless you have a torque wrench.I think this is a great value and am very satisfied with the product."
4,Look great but odd fit...,"Ordered these to replace the factory tail lights in a 97 Ford Ranger. I was a bit disappointed that there were no instructions of any type included, but was able to figure out pretty quickly how to get them in...even though the lights connect into different sockets than the factory ones did, just had to pay close attention to the shape of the socket in relation to the shape on the light plug. Once in, they do look awesome, except for a small gap all the way around the outer edge, which does concern me a bit that we may have issues later on with water leaking in. If so, it may be something that could be resolved by using a clear silicone to seal with maybe...guess we'll see."
5,Preparations for the Philharmonic,Delightful for kids of all ages. It opens the eyes of children as to how the musicians prepare for a concert.
4,Nice Rhythm!,"There are three things I really like about this book: (1) I like the idea of a story that shows children that some people go to work at night, to entertain other people who have worked all day. (2) I like the illustrations and the various stages of undress, then dress, that the characters go through, from putting on underclothes (one man has a hole in his black sock) to putting on shirt and ties and sweaters. (3) I like the rhythm of the sentences, which are longer and contain more phrases than most sentences in children's books do. But I think these long sentences with repeating patterns add to the musicality of the book.What I don't like about the book is that it's mostly buildup to the main event. The main event -- the orchestra playing beautiful music -- seems like a tiny ending added to everything that came before. Other than this disappointment, however, I found the book very enjoyable and I think that kids will see humor in people getting dressed for work."
2,The Philharmonic Gets Dressed,"I am a music teacher and I was purchasing books for my classroom. I was very disappointed with my purchase. The illustrations would not be appropriate to show in any classroom without causing quite a few laughs.I think I could share the book with my own children , but would not recommend this for any teachers out there."
4,Excellent Advanced Undergraduate Book,"The book is very good and are plenty of exercises. It helps advanced undergraduates to have a clue on what it will be ahead on their studies. Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to develop a little more the notion of probability spaces in terms of sigma-algebras."
2,hmmmmm,"I liked the Modern age, but what made me mad was the Heroic age. Couldn't Michael Han Friedman make up his own story instead of copying Brave Heart."
1,A Useful Guide?!? What a Joke!,"Unfortunately, Fodor's chooses to flatter sites/hotels/restaurants that are not even worthwhile in this adjective-laced and over-priced guide. Many of the ""magnificent,"" ""remarkable,"" and/or ""extraordinary"" sites mentioned in this guide were far from it. It lacks any candor or frank descriptions. That's not all, it gives no directions to hotels or restaurants and once again describes substandard food as ""wonderful."" I am also curious to know where these rocket scientists came up with their definitions of nice, clean and exciting. The book is a bust, go with another guide, it was a waste of my money. If it could get 0 stars -- it would."
5,AWESOME!!,"I have always liked Jerry Goldsmith, but this is one of his better scores. Even though the movie is kind of short, he brings life to it through his music. The themes he gives to the characters makes you feel for them, makes you attached to them. There are also parts in the movie that are very magical, and as a person studying composition in college, I can tell you it is very hard to compose something that sounds magical and breathtaking. He does it with ease and perfection. Even though it is quite expensive, take the money to get this, because I can tell you now, it is well worth it."
5,Great Soundtrack,I loved the music in this movie ever since I was little. I was so glad to see that this item was available. My favorite song is Flying Dreams sung by Paul Williams. Great soundtrack :)
2,"Rather outdated, but amusing","British English A to Zed takes one back in time to a romantic age where an old people's home was called an almshouse, and a car battery was called an accumulator. Alas, this book is so outdated that it is not of much practical value to the average American who is headed to England. On the plus side, it is an enjoyable book full of rich expressions and makes good reading for those not in need of a practical reference book."
3,Leadership does not always equal the strength of your faith,"I was very excited to get this book for the president of my school's Student Council where I am the sponsor. When I received it, I flipped through it and was immediately taken aback by the continuous references to Jesus, God, and faith. I believe in God; that isn't the problem. The problem is: 1. I wanted to use this book as a teaching tool in a school. Separation of church and state, hello? and 2. I wouldn't have bought this book if, in the review or summary, there had been any mention of religion. This book was for a student, not a family member. Can all you teachers out there just imagine the impending lawsuits? So, if you want a book to show the relationship between leadership and Christainity, then this is definitely the book for you."
2,green food review,"i know swanson usuually makes good stuff and this product is no different but the taste is awful,save yourself the money and get a kind that is flavored,this stuff tasted like fish food"
3,Two German erotic novels,"Typically I am not really a big fan of German erotic literature but this book contains two novels that are worth reading.The 'Blue Angel Nights' a book of 252 pages deals with the erotic adventures of the decadent rich in Germany in the 1920's ...The 'Blue Angel Secrets' is a similar account of 240 pages of some German actors in Hollywood in the 1930's ...The first book spends much more time describing and in typical (forgive the stereotyping) German fashion detailing sexual exploits while the second book has eroticism it is much more of a story as well.For those who like the style of writing it would parobably rate five stars but, again, it's not my particular taste since I enjoy the sensuality of seduction described in more detail ..."
3,"""The Great One"" it isn't","As a Jackie Gleason fan, I eagerly picked up this book, hoping for the definitive biography. I was disappointed. Although the book covers Gleason's life reasonably well, and is apparently well researched, the author seems to be obsessed with uncovering every untruth -- big or small -- that Gleason ever told. I tired of that quickly and found myself muttering, ""Enough, already"" repeatedly. About 100 pages into the book, I finally gave up on it."
2,Loaded with facts and yet...,"...I had a hard time liking this book for anything other than trivia nuggets. The author seems to endlessly delight in pointing out errors or outright lies in any and all Gleason anecdotes. He also makes sure to include every unflattering thing anyone ever said about Gleason, with very few kind things to balance them out. While I enjoyed learning new things about Jackie Gleason, I finished this book with an overall feeling that the author not only disliked him, but is almost jealous of Gleason's success, and tries to compensate for this by portraying Gleason as negatively as possible."
3,Cool,They are great to get the kids imajination going but they are cheep and no man's eyes. I like them.
1,what a waste,What a waste of time and money. I downloaded this but can't watch it unless the Amamzon downloader is open on my computer. Forget about trying to save it to a CD it's copyright protected and has to remain on your PC taking up resources.
3,neat looking ring,"ring was great for a while, but soon it started to change shape. Now the ring is almost square and where there was stress, it broke. I thought it was heavier when i bought it, but i guess i was wrong. Looked great while it lasted. I would buy again if it was alot thicker!"
5,Very helpful,"There is no loss of functionality or ability to sufficiently charge the phone (Cingular 3125) between this and the standard wire that comes with the phone. Very convenient, excellent to keep in a travel pouch with my travel wall/car USB charger."
3,More HRT than Menopause,"Despite its title and the fact that the author has another book, ""The Estrogen Answer Book,"" specifically about hormone replacement therapy (HRT), this books seems to deal mostly with HRT as opposed to menopause per se. ""The Estrogen Answer Book"" is more recent, which is important in light of rapidly changing medical opinions and outcomes of studies in the past few years. On the positive side, this book is easy to understand, and while she seems rather pro-HRT, Jacobowitz does not promote a ""one size fits all"" solution."
4,grand daughter's delight,"This necklace was too small for me, so I gave it to my grand daughter & she adores it!"
2,cheap quality,"This is an all-right item. The color is not as vivid as the picture shown, and the workmanship is poor. I'd only recommend it to someone who is less than 20-year-old."
3,Excellent resource for your professional library,"While this book contained much helpful information, it would not be my first choice for a book on geriatric therapy. It is thorough, but much of the same info can be found in more general texts like Willard and Spackman, etc."
3,Where is D-Train?,"Prelude is one of many labels to offer GOOD disco stuff and this compilation could offer more than this! ""You are the one for me"" by D-Train is not included here and it is the best tune from Prelude. Maybe vol.2 can have it. Then this is 5 star compilation series."
4,All of her novels are very well written,I look forward to her next novel as well. I recommend all three of her novels.
1,Disappointing to say the least...,"I was very much looking forward to reading Dream of the Blue Room since I loved Year of Fog so much. Man, was I disappointed. I could barely get through it and thought a lot of it was unbelievable. Like the whole relationship between Jenny and Graham... really? You'll know what I'm talking about if you read it. And the whole murder of Amanda Ruth... I didn't get that either. Definitely don't waste your time on this one - read Year of Fog instead."
5,An erotic literary masterpiece!,"Finally, an erotic novel in which the story and the writing are just as good as the sex scenes. My book club spent half an hour discussing the scene in the cave...Richmond combines lush, poetic prose with page-turning suspense. A book club winner!"
2,Confused and unsatisfying,"I think this book had the potential to be a good story, or even a couple of good stories. Unfortunately, I found it to be a little confusED and confusING, unsure exactly what the author intended the story to be about. I think she may have tried to address too many ideas in one novel, which I'm sure can work in some cases but I don't feel it entirely worked here. I read after that the author didn't know what she was going to write about until she started and the story developed to her as she went along - I think that's quite obvious. I almost stopped reading after being 3/4 finished the book and I don't usually do that, but it was becoming too frustrating. Too many details didn't seem to add up, some seemed entirely unbelievable, and too many partial plot lines in turn left me unsatisfied with all of them. Unfortunately not a recommendation from me."
5,GREAT READ!,Let Pauline Gedge take you by the hand and lead you back into ancient egypt. A richly detailed novel of egypt: Breathe the scented air of the pharaohs palaces and walk through the sandswept streets of this great civilization. For a stunningly fast novel that will keep you mesmerized this is a great read. The ending will blow you away. Highly recomended!
3,A good book to have on the side,"A well written book with plenty of technical informations. I could do without the techniques described that have to do with (for instance) incorporating beads in the oil painting (quite tacky in my opinion).What it lacks is information on mixes such as including alkyd with regular oil painting or amulsion techniques, etc......"
4,A Great Guide,"As an intermediate artist, I found this guide to be very useful in covering a broad array of topics in short article like pages. Illustrations are vivid and plentiful. I was able to fill in certain holes in my own knowledge as well as plan for purchasing my supplies. The writers try very hard to suggest a technique as opposed to saying that is the only way. I used the book as a mere reference for two years, then recently I read it from cover to cover. For those who have decided to move from acrylics to oils, the beginning artist or the intermediate oil painter I would recommend this as a great reference guide. The professional probably already knows most of this stuff, but if the said professional happens to be instructing a student, I would also recommend."
5,Art,"well art is my favourite subject at school and it is very interesting, not just fun. I aint as good at peinting as I am at drawing. I love using bright colours in everything I do. I like creating patterns and new ways of decorating things. If you think art is hard and you dont do it in your school years you should try it. Great Bye!!!"
5,an awesome projector for the price,"I love this video projector....for an incredible price it's turned my family room into a movie theater! When I put CHICAGO in the DVD player and saw it projected by the InFocus X1, I KNEW I had what I'd wanted all my life....my own theater!! The clarity and color were absolutely amazing on my 84-inch diagonal screen."
3,"Awesome, when it works.","I've owned this projector for about 2 years now and I keep it in the family room where it is used daily. Like others have posted, it's an excellent projector... until that noise kicks in.We are deciding whether or not to pay $350 for it to be fixed by our local service dealer or to buy a new HDTV.I would say, if you buy an Infocus projector, get the X2 since this is not manufactured anymore.That said, image quality is quite good, especially HD. For computers, it only goes up to 1024x768. When it was working, it ""Wow""'d anyone who saw it and was an awesome addition to the home theater."
5,Great experience with seller.,"The CD was in absolutely perfect condtion, and it arrived much earlier than expected. Would not hesitate to buy from this supplier again. Thanks so much!"
3,Solid Job by Author's,"This museum is one of the jewels of Chicago and this book does a very good job of documenting this part of the museum's collection. There are other museums with larger collections of this type, but I think the authors did a great job of displaying this collection in the best ""light"" that they could. I learned a lot from this book as well as having a good-looking coffee table edition. I enjoyed finding out more about the particular artist and scene. Overall this book is probably geared for the average person that just wants to know the basis of the topic."
5,Don't miss this book!!,"THE EIGHTH HOUSE contains everything you want in a crime/suspense novel. It is fast paced and keeps you guessing.For the uninitiated, there is enough technical information about the paranormal to allow the reader to understand significant plot points, yet it avoids being preachy or overly tedious in detail.The plot moves along wonderfully. The story is well thought out and executed with precision. Jensen balances the crime elements with just the right amount of information about the character's personal lives. The characters are rich and colorful. They are a pleasure to get to know. You will miss them when you finish the book.This is a book that will make you late for work, as you tell yourself you're just going to read ""one more chapter,"" and then find, once again, that you just can't put it down.All and all, reading this book was sheer pleasure."
1,Not what it says,We did not get a carbon fiber gear as the description states. It was plastic that will break just like the last plastic one did.
3,puts the babies to sleep,"This really worked putting a baby and a toddler to sleep. The singing is great, but I'm disappointed that the CD will not play in any of our computers"
3,Alice is a song to drink to,Will never forget this song while drinking at the Bad Durkheim wine fest in Germany... A classic... Americans need to loosen up and play it.. The rest of the CD is good also...
5,"great riddim, mon...","Putumayo has a knack for capturing wide ranges of styles within a particular genre on their compilation discs. ""Latino! Latino!"" and ""Cuba"" come to mind. ""Jamaica"" is no exception. A wonderful mix of reggae that will have you shuffling your feet or thumping the steering wheel as you ""visit"" the island. I always play this album in RANDOM mode. Keeps everything fresh."
4,Jamaica by Putamayo,"Good music for relaxation ! Not as upbeat as I had expected. My favorites were ""Midnight in Ethiopia"" which gave it a really exotic twist. I also liked #6 by Israel Vibration , who I had a chance to see in concert. They are an awesome group. Also Peter Tosh's music is good anyday. Pretty good CD on the whole ."
2,Not Enough,"This DVD contains only 11 songs as compared to the 22 that the CD brings. If you are a Raphael fan, you probably have seen the videos for these 11 songs. They are all from the 1960's. Two or three of those are in B&W. EMI did not spend any money on digitalizing properly these old films, they look old and scratchy. It's not exactly a good buy."
5,Friendship with God,"I have read over 1000 books, would recommend around 15, and this book would top the list. It very well may be the most important book written in history. You'll feel your life changing as you read it. Everyone needs to read this book."
4,The 1 star reviews are always funny.,"I always find it amusing to read the 1 star reviews for all four books. They are clearly from ""Born Agains"" who need to vehemently dispute any other idea as an attempt to promote their way, if only to themselves. I also observed most 1 stars are from the South. Being from the South myself, I can make that statement not as an insult to southern intelligence but as an observation of the predominance of close-minded (Southern Baptist) thinking in the South.I also don't like some of the 5 star reviews that blindly replace one unquestionable Bible with another. If there is one thing to be learned from this series of books it is to question everything and let the truth come to you. Of course please question that as well.These books are great at giving an alternate view of God than we have generally been taught throughout our lives. Take each idea for what it is and incorporate what you like while leaving out the rest. I personally agree with most, but not all of it."
5,Friendship With God and Conversations With God 1-2-and 3,"Clearly Man, created God in his immage and it is not a prity picture! Now these books shows us the truth, and it will set us free! the picture that emerges is that of a God that loves us unconditionally and gave us the free will to experience anything we might choose,without judgement and without punishment or the loss of Gods love. Therefore we do not need to be saved.We were simply never ""lost""and we cannot not be saved! So no hell,no purgatory,no required middleman to save us! Just a warm,wonderfull friendship with God. Theese books will change humanity and therefore the world.Read and re-read all four books and be part of a miracle!"
4,Need Proof?,"May I suggest The Many Waters by Lauretta Lueck. It says that God is Energy and Light, but the heavenly host are the intermediaries that communicate for God, to all of us. Where does Lauretta Lueck get this information? The Bible! This is NOT a religious book, in fact it gives the origin of religion, too. Shocking!If you need or want substantiation of Neil's concepts, you must read The Many Waters. I believe that it should accompany all spiritual books."
1,You need to read the BIBLE if you have questions!,"If anyone is confused about which religion is right, the BIBLE is what one should study, not a book which is simply someone's opinion. The Bible teaches the Fear of the Lord. God is in TOTAL control. In order to go to heaven, all you must do is believe that Jesus, who never sinned, was sent by the Father to be a sacrifice for the sins of all who believe."
2,Land of Oz,"Just click your heels together three times.....and we're off to see the wizzard! Need a heart, need a brain, need some courage? Have I got a deal for you.On the other hand we could all grow up and realize that it ain't that easy. The author says we and God are equals - buddies even! How egotistical and narcissistic do you have to be to believe that.As I was saying to Adam and his gal Eve the other day, once upon a time......"
5,Great Books!,"The CWG trilogy and Friendship With God are by far the best books on spirituality I've ever read. They are simply written, humorous, and speak with the wisdom of the ages. And, as I continue to read these glorious pages, I am slowly letting down my guard...allowing myself to open to the beauty of its message."
3,More of a lot of the same stuff...,"...some good, some redundant, but still with a good message. Much of the first half of this book was a re-hash of the CWG trilogy. I still believe Neale continues to have a good, down home, deep souled conversation with his inner self and found much truth to dispense to us. Neale has a message, and he is trying to share what he has found out about the universe and how it cosmically affects each and everyone of us and our Great Mother Earth.Good reading, some new concepts, include more guidelines (not rules or commandments) to forge a (easy) friendship with God. This time, Neale imparts some personal examples of occurrences to support his suppositions, which helps the reader to understand where he is coming from. Its a feel-good book. This maybe about where I personally disembark from Neale Walsch's bandwagon, because its important, as Neale will tell us in this book, to find yourself and be your own reality, instead of what other people or organizations tell you."
3,More than worth the cost,"I recommend this book. Friendship With God takes some of the basic concepts the author (Walsch) addressed in his original Conversations With God trilogy (books 1-3) and goes more in-depth. He and brings out some new ideas as well. It's well worth reading, but only AFTER you've read Conversations With God books 1,2 & 3."
3,Infinite patience,"This conversation must be real because only God could display such patience. After years of conversations, after at least three other books, and all the time to absorb and reflect Walsch insists on missing the points that most of his readers (who are getting this second hand) have already come to understand. I read and enjoy all these books but find myself skipping Walsch's parts and reading only God's parts. Walsch draws out the conversation and much of it is wasted while he fails to get it making a book much longer than it needs to be, or covering far less than it could. Still I buy these and enjoy them over and over. The message within resonates deeply for me and these books have become a part of my evolving system of beliefs."
4,Friendship with God,"This is definitly a ""big picture"" book, spiritual in nature but with limited appeal to a fundamentally structured Christian ethic. For those with an insatiable appetite, it acts as a lighter hearted continum to the trilogy, ""Conversations with God"" and while wordy in places with autobiographical reference, does a good job explaining in practical terms what life is all about. I would recommend it to those who want to continue down the road laid out so beautifully in the author's previous conversations. To those that have not experienced his earlier works, I would suggest starting with Vol. I, ""Conversations with God"" and continuing with the series before reading ""Friendship"""
1,Pure megalomania,"I hate to criticize something which people love, but this book and this writer cannot be instruments of God; both Walsch and ""god"" appear to be megalomaniacs. Please, please, go read ""He and I"" by Gabrielle Bossis, which is one of the most beautiful books ever written, and also purports to be a conversation with God. The difference between these books couldn't be more striking: in Walsch's you meet a ""god"" who could very well be a slurring drunk you meet at a bar, in Bossis' version, you meet a God of infinite goodness and beauty. Read both books and judge for yourself; or just read Bossis' and read something of true beauty."
1,What?,"Interesting to read, but more like wishful thinking. I did find it profound in some ways, but the author never convinced me that he wasn't just talking to himself in a drug-induced stupor."
5,"It's ""my"" perfum","I've used Giorgio since 1989 when I lived in BG, Ohio. Since then I use it every time I have to go out and it's always the same story. Either, - ""what perfum is that? It's soooo good!"" or ""knew you had arrived because could feel ""your"" smell in the air"". What else could I say about this product? I just hope they don't stop with it since it's so old."
4,Georgio always a favorite but still expensive,"I buy this for my sister all the time, but not usually online much because I can find it out in the market place much cheaper. But, she likes it so much that I had to get it late before Christmas so I paid the price. It arrived just fine and was shipped good."
5,Giorgio,"Exquisite scent. My favorite )) I recommend this product to everyone who wants to please their woman.Once you smell this aroma, you will never forget it ))"
5,Giorgio,"It's Giorgio, what else do you need to say about it. The smell of Giorgio is eternal. All you have to do is walk by someone wearing it and get compliments."
2,80's big time!,"Who remembers this being banned from public restaurants? This stuff was banned because it was so strong! It still is, nothing has changed! Its right up there with Poison and both can kill a skunk for heavens sake. I have nothing against either scent but lord have mercey on the rest of us-tone it down or outlaw it! Giorgio is sweet and loud. Nice but such a thing as too nice-those are the kind of people you stay away from!"
1,Very disappointed!,"I love Giorgio so much, that I could bathe in it. I couldn't wait to get it, but when I started to use it I was very disappointed. The quality is not there. I used to put it on in the morning every day and at night fall you could still smell Giorgio. But not what I received on order. After spraying it on, it only lasted about Ten minutes. I'm very disappointed."
5,It's a chemistry thing,"I have been wearing this scent for many years. Sure, I've tried others, but I keep going back to this. Every time I wear it, I get compliments. It must mix well with my personal chemistry."
4,An Interesting Mystery!,"As a teacher, I bought this book because it fit nicely into not only the nonfiction section of my classroom library but the mystery section as well. I was impressed by the format: story text and notes to provide background knowledge. I used this as a read aloud in my classroom to show how questioning techniques help with comprehension. My students enjoyed the book and the illustrations were lovely."
3,Good read but not a must read,"""Where Lions Roar"" is a good read, but it isn't one of Craig Boddington's best efforts. The book lacks a consistent tone. Some of the chapters read like a personal hunting journal, some like an interoffice memo, and some are classic safari tales. Too many chapters are consumed with personal minutiae about why he was on the safari, what article he was working on, who was there, and how everyone knew each other. The most revealing admission is the number of times pre-production ammo samples failed in the field. The hunting stories end abruptly for an appendix about planning a safari. I enjoyed the book, but there are better safari books out there."
1,Dissapointing,Boddington is at his best with details on rifles calibers and actions. This book is at best an account of Boddingtons adventures which are neither educational or informative. Too matter of factly written with no style. If you're used to Capstick's wit this book will dissapoint you.
5,"Touching, Compelling and Mature","As I passed the halfway mark, I would stop after every chapter to reflect and absorb the emotion of the author. I found Strawberry Field very touching, compelling and mature. The descriptive choice of words is very vivid and detailed as it draws you into the struggle of life for the girl. She shows a wisdom beyond her years blended with the questioning of a child. Her strength and survival are an inspiration, as she rises from victim in life to victor of life! I recommend this book to all readers."
4,Don't Stop Reading,"Strawberry Field starts out a little slow, but don't stop reading because very quickly it will grab you. It is the beautifully told story of how children suffer when families split apart, and one family in particular. It tells how sisterly love, kind people, and an unconquerable spirit help one very young girl survive a childhood of cruelty, poverty and isolation. This book is expertly written, and the story so compelling, you don't want it to end. I do not read many books, but this one was recommended to me, and is one of the best I've read in a very long time. For a relatively short novel, it tells a great big story."
2,Air Bed with Pump,"The service for buying was very good, It is saying here that I bought a Queen Double-High. Not so. I had ordered a single Airbed and that is what I recieved. The only problem is it don't hold it's air well. I don't want to pay shipping or fight to send it back so just put it away.Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump"
2,Worked well until poor manufacturing caused a leak,We enjoyed this mattress for the few times that it worked. After about 8 inflations a hole caused by a weak joint in a seam made it worthless.
1,Don't Buy!,"I didn't buy it from Amazon..I bought it from Big 5 Sporting Goods..this is my second one and no matter where I purchased it from the fact remains that the BRAND is the same and I've been through TWO of these..they kept ripping on the ""dips"" at the seam so that they can't be fixed wth!? What a waste of $69.99"
1,no star for this product,its waste of money.i just used it for 5 days it had a hole in it.onces again its waste of money.....................
1,Would not recommend,"The first time we used this bed it was great! Slept 1 petite female and held air all night, it was also very easy to deflate & repackage. Every use after that it will not hold air. No obvious leaks or tears and its only been used a handfull of times. Would not recommend or re-purchase."
1,Loved the product in the box,I bought for a gift and the pump was broke and it tore easy. Was very embarresed because I gave my daughter garbage for Christmas. There was now way to even repair it. Will not buy again!
4,Coleman Queen Bed,"Great sleeping Bed, my husband sometimes uses it because it's more comfortable than our mattress."
1,Garbage,"Coleman airbeds and air mattresses are complete garbage. I purchased a queen sized airbed for $70, which totally deflated the very first time I used it. Unfortunately I was on a camping trip and needed to purchase a replacement the following day. The only store in the area was a Walmart, which only had Coleman air mattresses in stock. I purchased the air mattress and took it back to the campsite, only to find it also did not hold air. Not only am I out $100 now, since the stores refuse to refund my money, but my entire weekend camping trip was destroyed. I am going to stick with Thermorest air pads, which last almost forever. DO NOT BUY COLEMAN PRODUCTS, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!"
1,take it back,i have been trying to return this item to LG OUTDOORSfor several weeks i have e-mailed and telephoned requestinga return authorizationthey have not returned or responded to either communicationit is unused
2,Second dud,"I have been using the airbed for friends and family when they come to visit. I mistakenly thought that because this bed was larger than the original twin Coleman airbed that I bought, it would last longer. It did not. After a couple of uses, my friends complained that the bed slowly deflated during the night. It is pretty much useless now."
1,really bad airbed or i am bad luck,"The first bed I bourght was leaking after 3 weeks. Fortunately, I realized this when I got up in the morning. I thought I was uncareful when I was sleeping over it during the night (but how unlikely is that). Then I bought another one. After 2 weeks, it began to concave in the middle and I was sour everywhere the next morning. And the worst thing happened. When I woke up at 1 am, I found myself imbedded in the bed. It is leaking again. It was 1 am in the morning!!! Finally, I had to deflate the bed, and slept on the deflated bed for the rest of the night. It is a nightmare."
1,Not Impressed,"After the second use of the bed, it began deflating itself after about an hour. What's the point? Also could not find any obvious leaks and the valve seemed fine. I would not recommend this product.Also purchased the warranty, but when I called KMART for a claim, they referred me to Coleman, who, after keeping me on hold forever, requires return shipping with no local repair provider. I didn't pay that much for the bed, so it's pretty much pointless."
2,Good but not reliable,"The bed came with all the mentioned accessories. I slept on it for 5 days, didn't find much problems. Filled the air 2 times to adjust the comfort in 5 days. From 6th day it started deflating it self. It became really mess during night to get up and fill it again. Probably, needed to use a little more reinforced material to last longer."
2,Disappointment,Your write-up said the DVD had English subtitles; your reviewer raved about the English subtitles;the box talked about English subtitles; the DVD options listed English subtitles. Guess what??? There are no English subtitles. There are translations of what the emcee is saying. That is very misleading.
4,Rare,This product is ok. It is hard to get as I don't believe Givenchy is continuing to produce it but has switched to other fragrances.
3,The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare,"A helpfull handbook to Shakespeare with articles on the individual plays and a dictionary of proper names (names in plays, names of locations, names of actors, etc.)For half the price you can buy an equally good if not better guide, Shakespeare A to Z, by Chalres Boyce."
3,A GREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY,"I bought this program and like it. The gentleman who had said that he was greatly disappointed because he wanted more written excercises... What do you want from a program that [is so inexpensive]? Most of the programS such as PRONUNCIATION POWER goes for [50% more] among others that go even much highter.THey are nothing compared to this. For [such an inexpensive] program, I didn't expect to get that much out of it. VERY SATISFIED!"
1,Very dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed with this product. It is not much in it, except a nice interface. I expected much more information and practice exercises. At first, I was going to buy ""American Accent Training"" book, but decided to try this CD-ROM. Now I regret that I spent 30 dollars on it and it did not worth that at all."
4,"As cute as it looks, and functional.","Good price for an adorable little storage unit. Easy to transport when I want to take photo CDs, etc. to the store or someone's house."
1,The Test Has Changed,"After buying this book, I found out that the CHSPE has been changed and updated so a lot of the information in the book is useless. The book doesn't even cover some of the subjects on the new test. Wish I knew that before I wasted my money on this study guide."
1,HORRIBLE,"don't buy this book it doesn't prepare you for the "" new "" CHSPE. I studied for weeks and had the stuff in this book memorized but it didn't help. This book is useless because the CHSPE changed. Find a book that helps you prepare for the new one. I wish I had read these reviews before studying and taking the damned test.AUGH."
1,Horrible Study Guide,"I did not find this study guide helpful in any way. I studied the entire book, went to take my test confidently, and saw that my weeks of studing were wasted because there was nothing in the book that was on the test. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK"
2,Didn't cover what was on the actual test.,I took the test today and have been reviewing using the book. The Math part didn't really tell much about what was going to be on the test.
1,Terrible preparation book,"I found this test prep book to be totally useless. WHile the reviews are ok, the questions are poorly construced, and the book often gives the wrong answer. I am appalled by the amount of incorrect answers I found and the clear lack of competant editors. This book continually contradicts itself and is inconsistent between its list of correct answers and explanation of answers. I have been using this book as a tool to tutor a student for this examination, and I just recieved a call from him after his exam. He said that the material covered in the book is not the material on the exam. In the future, I will recomend against this book and all other barron's book for test preparation."
5,"As a review, it works great!","We purchased this as an overall review of where our home-schooled children were academically. The information was invaluable! It helped us, as parents, regulate the remainder of the school year to better prepare our high-school aged son & daughter. We're not sure of it's value where the test is concerned, as we have always been more focused on overall knowledge than test-taking, but for our purposes and for the cost (we only paid $10) it was a bargain! We highly recommend this for other home-school families, as well as anyone interested in finding out just how much they already know! Now that......is PRICELESS!!!"
1,Spend your money elsewhere - this table will fall apart!,"It lasted less than 4 months. And the funny thing is, it was hardly ever used...it fell apart when transporting it from one room to another! The screws are way too short to be supportive, the 'wood' (particle board?) shreds and the glue is weak. A complete waste of money."
1,bad description and flimspy,"First off, this was ordered for my girls. It is labled primary colors, so I thought it would be fine. My girls aren't all that girly, so we prefer primary colors over pink and purple. But when we got it, it has sports balls on it. It is clearly for a boy. But there's nothing in the description that lables it as having sports balls or boy or anything. Now that I looked at it again, I can see the picture barely shows this. But it's not clear enough to see unless you know to look for it.Secondly, It fell apart before I barely put it together. The pencil eraser fell off the pencil before I even had the chair put together. Horrible product. Returning it to amazon to get my $$$ back!"
1,DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS,I received this Table Set and 1) The directions sheet is atrocious and not at all reflective of the actual component list included. 2) IT WAS DEFECTIVE. Both of the chairs were missing one leg inset with corresponding nut and threading. Could not assemble. Basically a $50 set of paper weights.
2,Throw in the kitchen sink,"I have read several books by Barbara Metzger and enjoyed them thoroughly. This title is not one of them. I agree with the reviewer who said it felt like a circus ring. There are just too many ditzy characters, too many plot lines and, just when I thought, ok, now we get back to the hero and heroine's relationship, another crazy thing happens. I don't know if this is one of her earlier titles or not, but the entire story was out of control and not in a good or funny way. She has written some sweet and amusing books--Lord Heartless, The Duel, and Miss Lockharte's Letters come to mind. Read one of these titles instead."
2,Too much craziness,"Too much is sometimes a bad thing. That's how I felt about the plot. It was ridiculous - like a circus act. The heroine became annoying with each ""innocent"" scrape she would find herself in, and the unlikely situations of the mariad of characters were just one after the other. It seemed like the purpose of yet another ""situation"" was just to foil the earl from bedding his wife ... ludicrous. I like fun light reads, but would not recommend this one."
3,Ok putter. Not great. Warps easy.,"I like discraft, but this putter is okay at best. The material of the Soft APX warps VERY easy and loses shape. Mine looks like I'm throwing a floppy pancake. It's only purpose now is a marker. It's feel was good when dry, and it was fairly accurate at about up to 30ft, but was terrible if wet.Overall not terrible, the durability was okay...but take it out on a hot day and you may as well throw it in the trash. It'll warp and never go back."
2,These are not First Alert smoke alarms,"Be aware that these are NOT First Alert branded smoke alarms. They come in a plain brown cardboard box, and the name ""First Alert"" appears nowhere on the packaging. They are made by ""BRK Brands, a Jarden company"". That doesn't necessarily mean they're bad, they're just not as described in the Amazon listing. I would not have ordered them had I known that they were ""no name"" smoke alarms--Walmart sells these on the bottom shelf in big stacks.Amazon quickly arranged a refund, so I'm totally satisfied with my purchase experience, but do want anyone else to be aware of what you may be buying."
4,Made somewhere other than China,"I bought these because they were the ONLY smoke alarms I could find that weren't made in China. They're made in Mexico and seem a bit sturdier than all the broken malfunctioning chinese Kidde and First Alerts I replaced in my home.I rated it a 4 because it's not the best looking design, nor easiest to open. However the build quality is not as sub-par as the others."
5,This book should be required reading for all couples,Larry gives a lot of wisdom applicable to any couple. This book could save a lot of marriages from ending in divorce or neglect. It is also a very interesting read and not difficult to finish.
1,Warning: this book for Christians only!,"I bought this book based on its positive reviews, but was very surprised to find how religious it was. I am not a Christian, and I was annoyed that the author not only assumed that I was, but force-fed me Bible quotes with every piece of advice. I'm sure this book is great for those of you looking for religous teachings, but not for someone like me who only wanted sound financial advice."
5,Great advice on how to setup a budget that acutally works!,"Before reading this book and setting up a budget, our biggest marital problem was money. This was stupid, because we both had great, high paying jobs. After setting up a budget using this book as a guide, we stopped arguing about money."
2,rather dissapointing,"Well, I bought this series with high expectations, but started to get dissapointed as the first episode was just starting. With a mixture of sci-fy (the day repeating over and over, with no explanation whatsoever as WHY??)..sometimes the things going on, just didn't make much sense. Also, the music at times was,at least to my ears, extremely annoying, sounding over the dialogues, which at times, I just couldn't understand..THERE ARE NO CAPTIONS, OR SUB-TITLES AVAILABLE.Ahhh, I don't know, I actually didn't enjoy it... In a few words, I'd skip it"
4,No Captions or Subtitles,"I'd give 5 stars - seems like a great show so far - but beware - there's No Captions OR Subtitles - Jeez, pretty much all dvds have one or the other - this has nothing!"
2,No closed-captioning or subtitles.,"Please have it closed-captioned (CC)--or better yet, subtitled for the deaf and hearing-impaired (SDH) for the next time you re-release this movie! As I'm deaf, I'm unable to enjoy the current movie release."
2,Good Show but bad DVD,I really enjoyed the show but the quality of this particular DVD release is lacking. As described in other reviews it comes in a thick DVD case which should be able to accommodate the four or five Disc that you would expect with 13 episodes plus the extras. When you open the case there are 2 Discs in paper sleeves that sit in a pocket of the case. Very odd. After reading the small print on the DVD packages I did find that it states there are 2 Discs while the DVD packaging gives the impression that it would contain more. What a shame since it potentially had a chance to be a very nice set with the commentary extras.The good news is that this set was found at Target for $5. At that price it might be worth buying since the show was entertaining and did have some closure.
4,"Decision, Consquence","He's framed for a murder he didn't commit. His sister and girlfriend are threatened. His partner has her own problems, and his informant has been compromised. In short, it's been one lousy day.But Detective Brett Hopper has an advantage - he's reliving the same day over and over again. Every day may be a nightmare, but every day gives him more clues and more facts to understand what forces have conspired against him. Another chance to find out who sent him evidence of a past murder case. Another chance to discover why his fingerprints are on the murder weapon. Another chance to find out why the wife of the dead man has identified him as the shooter. And if he makes enough of a difference, he may change the day for the better - or worse.The idea isn't new, but the time loop concept placed into the setting of conspiracy and mystery gives it a new twist. The show was a lot of fun, and if you consider it a miniseries, you'll enjoy how it plays out."
3,5 stars for the show 3 for the DVD,"Great idea fun show, but no extras on the DVD, nothing.... No subtitles for guys who are hard of hearing... what? Thanks for finishing the show whoever did this as I watched it when it was on TV and never got the answers the DVD provides"
4,Groundhog day... NOT!,"Really enjoyable (and addictive) TV series at a great price. It doesn't take long to get into this fast paced show that is well scripted, has high production values and features great acting from the entire cast. The story is such that it keeps you guessing as to who is good and who is bad. I don't understand why the full series was not aired on TV. A few loose threads but thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommended!"
5,It Got WHAT?!?!,"I cant believe this show got cancelled after just 1 season. This is good TV. My wife is a ridiculous critic, very hard to please and she could not stop watching this series. We watched all 13 episodes in about 3 - 4 sittings. Good stuff. Nice plot with good acting. Taye Diggs is seriously underrated. The show has everything. There is only one character that annoyed the heck out of us but other than that I will be one of the first in line if they ever bring this back. Kept me interested for all 13 episodes. I was actually sad when it came to an end...seemingly. I give this one 8 out of 10."
2,Salt and Pepper...,"A relatively decent series.A little slow and aggravating at times.The white woman divorced from a white copand married to his ex black partner isgeneric. Is it just me or is itless then enjoyable television towatch 2 races slobbing all over each other?It seems acceptable if Italians want tokeep marriage between Italians.Irish between Irish...etc etc.Yet when it comes to black and whiteall of a sudden if you do notembrace it and rejoice exceedinglyabout it when it desired to haveCaucasian with Caucasian or Blackwith Black...then your a racist bigot?I think it is natural not to beoverly embracing of it. I thinkthis is natural and does not makeone a racist. I have many blackfriends..good friends. I have neverseen a Blue Jay hooked up witha Cardinal? Yet...if 2 peoplechoose to be with each other, that istheir decision..we will still be friends.But I do not want to watch them slob allover each other...nor do I want towatch it on TV."
4,Daily,"The movies were in excellant condition. The only thing that i have against it is that they wee in this paper sleeves that hold the dvd's. the series was very awsome, its kinda like groundhog day the movie where things constantly repeat in order to fix them."
3,Timex Women's Indiglo Watch # T17151,This is a stylish watch but it weighs alot. It is made of stainless steel which makes it very heavy.
1,Timex Women's Indiglo Watch # T17151,"arrived quickly which was great but, watch didn't work. Bought a new battery but can't open the back of the watch and retailers won't open because I didn't buy the watch from them, I guess im S.O.L. anyone have any tips on how to get this watch open, any idea would be greatly appreciated."
5,Excellent lights,I purchased 14 of these lights for exterior front and back landscape lighting at our home. These are beautiful when lit. I did replace the batteries provided with the newer NiMH battery as they hold a longer charge. I have NO complaints with these. They are terrific lights
4,They're puuurrrty...,"Bought 2 sets for a girlfriend for Christmas. They look to be of really sturdy construction. Glass is beveled which refracts the light nicely. Haven't used them myself but if I had a home and was looking for outdoor lighting, I would go with these. The mini-panes hark to a Japanese aesthetic."
4,Very nice addition to patio,"These lights are very nice looking, not cheap looking like some others i've seen. They need a lot of light. If not in full sun for better part of the day, don't bother getting them."
1,Disappointing light output,"Although these lights are attractive, they do not light a walkway. This is very disappointing, considering the price."
4,"Alone, weak...with the book, outstanding!","This video is a static camera recording of a conference session. As such, it's without context and difficult to follow. In conjunction with Jae's book ""Secrets of the Underground Trader"", however, this clarifies many of Jae's concepts and illustrates how to implement many of the strategies in Jae's book. The book is great, with very specific scalping and swing strategies, but Jae's style is extremely dense and assumes an understanding of many chart-watching concepts. The book alone requires numerous readings to grasp - the video alone lacks context and is weakly produced. The combination, however, will add a very powerful set of strategies to any trader, especially traders specializing in NASDAQ 100 stocks."
2,Poor presentation,A relatively weak presentation and not very structural...slides are very not professional... and maybe not very updated to today's market... I guess he spent time on level II but not a lot... So far.. I do not like it.
4,Classic Bach as it should be Played,"The Brandenberg Concertos are among the classics of Bach that all music lovers should own. This recording, while not limited to period instruments, gives an excellent example of why Bach lovers love the Brandenburg Concertos."
1,Additional information,This is not a review because I am one of the authors. All I want to do is point out that there is a heated debate about the origins of Vanda Miss Joaquim. Mr. Johnson is strongly opposed to the views of the authors of this book. I have rated the book with only one star because comments with no stars cannot be posted.Joseph Arditti
1,Not My Recommendation,"I have found too many errors in this book. The facts that the Singapore authors should know, they have wrong. Holttum was never Ridley assistant (page 46)! The text is confusing: page 60 ""only one parent, Vanda teres is foreign.""; on page 225 the first sentence, on the same subject, reads ""two orchids from foreign countries"". Captions under photographs are confusing as on plate 14. The most serious error is that many of the citations are not in the ""Literature Cited"" making a check of validity impossible. The problems I had are summed up in the dates for Agnes Joaquim's death: the book on page 41 gives 1898,on page 205 is a picture of her tombstone showing the date as 1899."
1,Haier quality is typically poor,"YOU MAY WANT TO READ THE REVIEWS ABOUT OTHER HAIER PRODUCTS BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE.Haier products get bad reviews for poor quality and difficulty getting replacement parts. Even on this wine cooler, 1 person reports a problem.Also, many of them start making noise after a month of running and have to be unplugged for a while.You may luck out buying this:1. This one might be better made them other Haier products.2. You might get a good one.To set the baseline: Most reviews for appliances and electronics on Amazon are negative. Most reviews are written by people who bought a product, had trouble with it, and get even by writing a bad review. People who get good working electronics or appliances do not tend to write reviews, so you don't see the possitive experiences as much. (This is the opposite of music and books, where people tend to write about their favorite stuff)."
5,A quick Read for Praise,"I found Doug and Tami's book a quick read, but a very resourceful book. The transposition charts alone will be a great help to worship leaders for transitions between tunes. Well done.Cary NasatirAuthorPraise & Worship Drumming: A Guide to Playing in Church"
5,A Must for Worship Leaders and Praise Teams,This book has been a tremendous help for me as a new Worship Leader. It has helped me to be better prepared for rehearsals. Great read!
3,The title speaks for itself.,"Again, another misstated comment on the book's condition. Not much say, other than I'm not happy with the condition. I know it was sold as ---used, but very good. I believe I've learned a very hard lesson."
2,comfortable,these shoes are very comfortable. The leather is very soft. But it's out of shape after wearing once for a wedding.
2,SIZED REALLY LARGE!!!,"The shoe is cute and very inexpensive, but I can't wear it because it is so big. I wear a size 9 shoe and every other shoe I've ever bought online has fit, but not this one. It is 1-1/2 inches longer than my other shoes. It would have been ridiculous to return a shoe that cost so little so I am giving them away. If you wear an 8, order a 7."
3,Wrong color,Not the exact color Navy I was looking for. The shoe runs just a little small but I can have it stretched.
4,value for money,"I bought a size 9 because thats what i usually wear but this one is sized slightly larger. I need to use either socks or stockings with it always so it doesn't slip off my feet and that is a bit of a bummer. But its very comfortable, value for money and good for women with briad feet like me. I'd suggest you go half a size down if you want to buy it"
5,Hot Tuna Live at Sweetwater 2,"A must have for Tuna enthusiasts. A solid amazing set from the masters, as usual."
1,chirp,I agree with another reviewer. I have had one for several years and chirps now constantly new battery does not help.
1,"Hate it, hate it, hate it","I inherited one of these when I bought my house and I hate it. The stupid thing ""chirps"" randomly all the time. The chirp is supposed to tell you that your battery backup is running low, but I've replaced the battery twice in less than a year and the stupid thing keeps chirping. Don't waste your money on this smoke alarm; it may detect smoke, but it will try to chirp you to death in the process."
1,Biggest piece of #%$#^ ever,"This piece of junk is one of the few detectors that meets Illinois residential building code (curious the company is Illinois based). Illinois requires battery and 120v power plus interconnects. However, these things will not stop chirping. Even after removing the batteries and unplugging them, they chirp for several minutes (must be an internal capacitor). The battery replacement compartment does not hold the batteries. These should REALLY be recalled. I can't believe something this bad could have made it to market. I will never by another First Alert product after experiencing this piece of trash. The silence feature is really dumb. When you press the silence button, it chirps for fifteen minutes to tell you that it is in silence mode. (How is this silent?) The only way to stop it from chirping is to remove the batteries, pull it off the wall to remove 120v power. Then you need to smash it to pieces to break the circuit board."
3,Hackers Guide to the Slots,"There's a lot of information in this book. Unfortunately, in this book the author promotes the use of techniques that permanently scar the very canyons he claims to want to protect. How absolutely absurd is it to chop a big hole into pristine sandstone instead of using natural anchors that are just a foot or so away! I personally would recommend boycotting this book. But since that won't happen (there really IS a lot of information in this book), I hope readers will be more careful than Mr. Kelsey's new book when it comes to the environment."
2,Frustrating and Necessary,"This book encourages poor-form techniques that damage the environment, gives inaccurate information that will at some point get you lost and frustrated, is presented in a block-text format that is incredibly difficult to wade through, uses bizarre terminology and sometimes presents deceiving impressions of canyons. This book is a constant source of amusement and hair-tearing frustration for myself and my canyoneering companions. However, I have decided that it is a necessary resource with which to corroborate online sources. I use it as little as possible."
1,NO to Storaka,"Storaka book and his methods are based on women using their ""feminine wiles"" on the attacker and that women should never try and fight back because women are too weak and too incompetent. After one of his lectures, enthusiastic young woman was breathless explaining why a woman shouldn't kick, because she would lift her leg and JUST FALL OVER. (If you can walk, you can learn to kick properly.)Women would be better served by taking an actual all women self-defense class TAUGHT_BY_A_WOMAN. Where you can freely discuss issues you would not feel comfortable bringing up in a mixed group. Contact the National Women's Martial Arts Federation (www.nwmaf.org). They can direct you to the closest class in your area. Also read about survival strategies that worked, Stopping Rape: Successful Survival Strategies by Pauline Bart, a pioneer in the field who ""discovered"" the targeting/testing/attack sequence."
1,This book is a joke.,"This book tells you exactly what you should NOT do to survive a rape. The author lists many ""techniques"" that he says may or may not help you out of a situation where you're being attacted by a rapist. This whole book is a joke. Almost every one of those ""techniques"" can actually get you into more trouble in the event of you being raped. It's not hard to figure out that his intention is not to help people figure out how to protect themselves from future attacks. THE AUTHOR IS A MAN!!!! What else can you expect from a man? Do you honestly think that a MAN will have the best interst at heart? NO! Fredric Storaksa, I see right through your sick attempt to allude the human race into even more sadistic perversion. WHY WAS THIS BOOK EVEN PUBLISHED AT ALL is what I want to know?!??!"
4,What an exciting book to read!,"Interesting characters, fascinating settings, full of mystique and intrique! Despite the grim circumstances, it was written in a witty style that provided many laugh-out-loud moments to keep it light and flowing easily."
3,Don't we all like to look into the lives of the rich,Loved reading the lives of the rich. Easy to connect with the main character. Good summer read.
3,One Dangerous Lady - not as enticing as the title.,"Ok book, really picks up speed and interest level as the book progresses...too much time spent on relationships w/o you knowing where they were going...."
3,Too talky,This is the first and only book I've read by Hitchcock and I couldn't fininsh it.There was so much repitious dialogue and little forward plot movement.Dissapointing!
5,Great Collection of Older Recordings,"Fans of Chet's more recent recordings (1980's to his death) may be surprised to learn that there was yet another Chet Atkins. The earlier Chet often played complicated melodies accompanied by syncopated bass lines. The later Chet played complicated arrangements with less of the syncopation which was his first trade mark. In any case, real Chet fans will love this collection of older recordings, many originally released on 78 rpm's. But then the real Chet fan probably has multiple copies of all these recordings released in various forms over the years."
1,No Customer support after sale,"After about 8 months my unit failed, I have been ignored twice via e-mails to Cyberpower, and today was just hung-up on twice after tying to reach tech support and warranty departments. The only person I spoke to was during the call for warranty work, and that was an operator to switch me to the department after being on hold for 1-2 minutes, click- goodbye.The second call to tech support via the phone keypad was disconnected after a message to contact via e-mail.Beware they do not want to talk to you once you have purchased the item. go with any other UPS provider!"
4,CyberpowerUPS,I have had a Cyberpower UPS before and liked it. I liked the price and the dependability from before. So far this product is holding up well. I am using it for a desktop PC.
2,I'd like to throw this CD under that train...,It's that bad. The backing band I guess is what makes it bad. Nowhere nearly as tight as the Radics. Stay away from this one.
5,Rumblies Felix the Fire Truck,"Exactly what a first fire engine should be. Our 6-month old Godson loves it. He can teeth on the end of the fire hose and he loves the lights and the clicks of the tires, and parents aren't worried about his safety playing with it, because it is so soft."
2,"Great mug, but way too expensive here!","This is a great mug, but it's like 2 or 3 dollars from corelle direct, and in brick and motar stores.I would give it 5 stars, but Im giving it 3 since the price is comparatively high. Not sure why its so much here...Anyways... I had to add $5 to my order to get free shipping or else pay $5 for shipping....so I added this to my order since I figured I was playing an extra $5 anyways I might as well get a mug!Unless youre in my situation, just buy ceramic mugs are real stores for 2-3 dollars, lol."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with these cups. Thought they would be light, but they are very thick and heavy."
3,Origin?,"Sorry -- This is NOT a review. I just need to know if these are made in China, as I absolutely refuse to buy anything made there, mainly for safety reasons. Thanks!"
2,Plane,"Not the greatest hand plane out there. Bought it mainly to use as rough in work. A little difficult to adjust, but for the price, you can't ask for much."
3,Not too exciting,"I sympathize with the author's idea of creating a book of photos and art that would show readers of her novel, The Far Pavilions, the images that inspired it. The novel is a classic set in India, but this picture book did not particularly help me visualize the scenes from the book. I think my own imagination, prior knowledge of India, and previous browsing of books and magazines portraying India created all the mental images I needed to interpret the novel. However, some people may really enjoy what the author compiled from her own files, which include both color and black and white photos and paintings of landscape and people. None of them are recent of course, the book having been published in 1979, and some of the images dating back as far as the 1800s."
2,Not too happy after all:(,"I purchase this boning knife and it works great and it's great price to. This company has a very good reputation too.UPDATE-09/29/2010 I have used this knife to slice chicken boneless breast and remove fat on poultry & beef. After a while I could see little chips in the blade. I always keep my knives sharp and use a steel before use of any of my knives. None of them have chips on the blade, so I contacted Victorinox and they wanted me to send it back with a S&H; fee of $10.00. Well the knife cost me it's not worth it, so I am looking at replacing it with a forged steel boning knife this time. I have other knives from this company and never had a blade to show signs like this and my other knives are used more and harder. So it could be a steel edge problem but not too happy with this particular knife."
4,Good for the money,"I think this knife is pretty good. It's fairly sharp and is pretty flexible. Compared to my Wusthof classic boning knife, I would say that it is not as good. The Wusthof is slightly more flexible and more sharp. I also think the Wusthof has a better handle. This knife has a bulky handle that will take some getting use to. The textured handle feels hard and light. It is made for a cooking school or a butcher. Cheap and durable. The Wusthof seems to be better suited for a pro chef or advanced home cook and has about the perfect feel but it costs much more. I would say if you want a great boning knife then get the Wusthof, if you want a good knife for the price then get this knife."
5,"Great knife, makes quick work of chicken and fish",Knife has a good feel and bend of the blade is good without being too much. My wife said it cut prep time in half for triming and making cutlets from chicken breasts.
4,Extra sharp knife,This knife is super sharp like all Victorinox knives and keeps its edge very well. I just wish I had more uses for it.
5,Great boning knive,"This knive was highly recommended by America's Test Kitchen over others that are much more expensive. It doesn't disappoint. Sharp, just the right flex and length. A great knive for boning, removing silver skin, and any other kitchen uses you may have for it."
5,GREAT KNIFE FOR THE MONEY,"I HAVE MANY KNIVES AND JUST ORDERED A FEW VICTORINOX KNIVES. THESE KNIVES ARE GREAT AND CUT THROUGH MEAT VERY WELL. I SAW THESE KNIVES RECOMENDED ON SOME WEBSITES THAT DEAL WITH BUTCHERING MEAT. MY OTHER KNIVES ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE FORGED KNIVES FROM WUSTHOF AND HENCKELS, THERE ARE GREAT, MY FAVORITE ARE THE WUSTHOF BUT THE VICTORINOX ARE EASIER TO WORK WITH AND ARE PRETTY AMAZING HOW WELL THEY CUT. FORGED KNIVES HAVE ADVANTAGE FOR CHEF KNIVES AS WEIGHT HELPS CUT THROUGH HARDER THINGS LIKE CARROTS, CARTILAGE AND BONE."
5,"Great edge, great handle","Like all of the other Victorinox knifes I own, this one is a bargain; they could easily charge much more for these. The blade has a nice flex to it and the edge is great as well. The handle is anti slip, large and ergonomic, even after hours of use. I am sure there are better knives out there, but for under $30, there is nothing that will match this. I cannot say enough good about this knife."
5,Best Knife,"Forschner knives are great. Then don't have the high price tags that the more famous knives have. They are made buy the company that makes Swiss Army Knives. They sharpen up great. We sharpen our knives once a year.I have several different types, the 8"" chef, several paring, a slicer and the boning knife. I just purchased another chef and 7-Inch Granton Edge Santoku Knife."
5,great knife for the price,This knife has performed well beyond its price. I bought it primarily for butchering game. This fall I used the knife to butcher 2 deer and a turkey... it held its edge well enough and it was easy to put a new edge on it.
5,Ignore Low Price,"Just Ignore the low price compared to other quality knives. The handle has a sure, non-slip grip. The blade is just flexible enough to get around those tight spots and the edge, so far, seems to hold up for quite a while. The blade does seem to stain just a bit so a little extra care washing and drying thoroughly is in order. This just a great little knife!"
4,Turducken,"Used the knife for de-boning a turducken. Have de-boned two turkey's, a chicken, and a duck. The knife was more than up to the task. Must be careful because it is sharp and will cut bone (But I'm sure you would expect that.). I've noticed that it needs a little touch up sharpening after all that cutting, but it worked as described. For the price, I was easily able to pay for the knife versus paying the butcher to de-bone the meat for me. This knife has more than payed for itself (In blood!) Did I mention it was sharp? I have admiration for a butcher de-boning anything. It is an art form and hard work. Good knife to learn with."
5,Sharp knife with a great handle,"I bought this knife because it was highly recommended by Cook's Illustrated magazine and I'm very glad I bought it. It comes super sharp out of the box and stays sharp if you use a good ceramic sharpener occasionally. The fibrox handle is grippy even when wet, as advertised. As mentioned by Cook's Illustrated, all you'll need is a chef's knife, carving knife, pairing knife, and a bread knife to round out a collection of the only knives you'll actually need in your kitchen (aside from small steak knives)."
5,another good knife,"this knife does exactly what it's supposed to. It is very flexible, comfortable to use. I should have bought it sooner."
4,boning knife,"I use the 6 inch boning knife for cutting up deer. It holds an edge for a good length of time and has a nice stiff blade to help when cutting next to the bone.For the price you, you can't beat it."
2,Not fine stemware,"These are made of heavy glass, fairly crude manufacturing, and belong under the ""casual dining"" category.Not what I expected."
4,Good for moderate skill level player,"I bought this game online. It does come in higher resolution versions. I bought from their website though so I don't know what this disk actually contains. I did get the same disk by mail from them and it contained several different resolution choices. So, I don't know why the other reviewer didn't get those.You can choose different ""players"" to play against with varying skill levels.I play with family quite a bit and even though I'm not an expert, I can win almost every time with this game. It's unusual for me not to win even choosing the best players to play against.It's fun and it passes the time but it doesn't really challenge me. I was hoping for something that might challenge me to improve my skills. This is not it. For the beginner, I think it's a good way to learn to play."
2,Abysmally edited...,"This was anything but a page turner. The subject matter was very interesting, and I learned a great deal that I hadn't known about the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The problem is that the whole thing was so poorly edited that I couldn't stand to read it for very long in a single sitting..."
2,A rehash that offers nothing new,"Friedman's shallowly researched book offers nothing beyond what's been published before. He appears to have relied on secondary sources nearly exclusively, which is sad when there is so much good information available in the ship action reports, squadron reports, and so on.Disappiontingly, the bibliography credits just seven primary sources, and a few of these are just single letters from survivors to the author.The book doesn't take you far beyond what others -- Thomas Cutler and Samuel Eliot Morison -- have already offered. The writing is serviceable, but does not breathe magic into a story that is so rich with it."
5,"At Last, an Affordable Book of Photographs by France's Premier Fetish Photographer","""At last, an affordable [$19.95] book of photographs by Gilles Berquet. Saddle stitched, heavy paper similar to the 'Edwarda' book from the same publisher. A short introduction to the works of France's premier fetish photographer.""-- zebraz"
1,STINKY! WASTE OF MONEY!,"I purchased this as a gift. The scent IS NOT the same as the one I had purchased in Paris, France! This one stinks! To call it a ""fragrance"" is too good for it. It would be more appropriately called an ""odor""! It's extremely overpowering and awful. A 100% WASTE OF MONEY!!!! I will never purchase a fragrance by mail again. My lesson is to ALWAYS buy a fragrance at a department store so I'll know what I'm getting!"
5,Perfect fit for my hand,I have arthritis and had to search for a mouse that didn't cause me pain. So many of them are shaped too high for me. This one is perfect!
2,Disappointed,"I've always loved the Country Gentlemen and saw them from their earliest days. However, I was a little disappointed in this CD."
2,"I guess you buy cheap, you get cheap","Not what I'd call a ""pin spot"". At 10 feet distance the center, brightest part of the light beam is about 16 inches across, with the overall beam spread going out to about 5 feet. This is probably more a function of the bulb than the fixture, but the fixture itself is not focusable in any way, so be aware of what you're getting.As others have noted, the mounting bail is very thin. I can literally bend it between my thumb and 2 fingers. This is NOT a light for a portable DJ or band."
3,Not as pin-like as you might hope,"I had really hoped this would be a solution for our dance party room, replacing the LED flashlight I currently use for our mirrorball. Sadly, however, it's just not narrow enough - it has a secondary halo that makes the room too bright. I thought about trying to extend the shield to prevent the excess light, but that's more work than sticking with the flashlight. I recommend LEDs, which have a narrower beam."
4,works well for price...,"for a couple bucks they work great.we have 2 on a 10"" mirror ball and it def fills the room up! they could have a little more of a concentrated beam as there is some light that passes the ball,but overall your hard to find something better for the price..weve put on about 20 hours so far on each light with no bulb failures.."
3,disco ball light...,"I bought this to shine on my disco ball for a disco party i am having. It got banged up a bit in shipment and has a dent on the front of the light, but i plugged it in and it works so i'm not too concerned about the dent. Very bright too."
4,A great reference to use while working on your VW.,"I would say that this book is a great reference to use while working on your VW. It can take a little getting used to the chapter layout at first, but once you get the hang of that, it's easy to navigate. So far, I have been able to find everything I have needed to make it possible to do work on my VW with very little trouble and highly recommend this book. When it comes to VW's, you will not find a better provider of information then Bentley and that's a fact!"
2,Big book but not so great,"I also have a book for BMW by the same publisher and that book is far better. This one simply tries to cover too many vehicles and options so lacks deep information about any specific vehicle. Explanations of how stuff works, why it breaks and how to diagnose are thin. The electrical diagrams are abominable. I was perturbed to find the coolant level sensor absent from the coolant system diagram for the 1.8L engine. If you, like me, get the blinky ""Stop - check service manual"" light on your dash, do not bother with this book. No connection between it, the owners manual and that common warning.I wish I knew a better book to recommend for you VW problems."
4,have to return,Is not the correct manual. More complete description of item would have been helpful.
4,Very Good Reference For The Weekend Mechanic,"While I am not a pro repair guy ,this volume has all the info most weekend wrenches will need to do any repair they want to take on.Be aware VW does require special Model specific tools .Look before you takle a repair project."
5,OUTSTANDING SHOP MANUAL,"The most expensive shop manual I have ever bought, but, far and away the best. Graphics, content, accuracy, exceeds Haynes, Clymer and Chilton. The VW dealer will yield no useful information at all (even when you tell the ""code"" and ask for parts guidance), and, this manual provides the do-it-yourself experienced mechanic all you need."
5,GTI Service Manual,"If you purchased a 2005 VW GTI I highly recommend this book. It is the factory original manual for the entire car! So, when you have a repair you have instructions on how to fix it and diagnosis. If you are not able to fix it at least you understand what is involved and no one at a dealership or shop will rip you off on a repair since you have all the info!"
4,Bentley golf 2000 repair manual,Excellent product - very detailed illustrations and high-quality photos. Everything the DIY person needs to fix most systems on the 2000 Golf.
1,slooow,Ordered on Wed. Azamon warehouse 5 miles away. 5 days later order not picked yet. Poor Company HR MGT. Car still broken awaiting product.
5,"Volkswagen Jetta, Golf, GTI (A4) Service Manual: 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 - 2 VOLUME SET","If you own a Jetta TDI, this is a must have. Forget Haynes, this should be your only source for researching issues or performing maintenance. I was well advised to get this resource from my online forum. Not only do you get illustrated pictures for performing tasks and maintenance. Bentley identifies specific VW tools required (there are many) for specific tasks. Well worth the money and with the Bentley supporting website you can request and be advised of issue that comes up to keep your Jetta running smooth!"
5,"Volkswagen Jetta, Golf, GTI Service Manual: 1999-2005",This book is necessary for anyone who has a Jetta in this year range. It was in great condition and I am very happy with it.
4,The only book you need.,This is the standard repair manual. Really long and detailed. Best you can get for VWs
5,Everything you need to service your VW,"Very easy to use, clear diagrams including wiring, and step by step dissassemble reassemble procedures. If you are an experienced mechanic or if it's your first time under the hood, this THE book you need.Accept no substitutes !!"
2,Not so great,"Not what I expected. I thought this book was the equivalent to the OE manual, but instead the books have repeating, lack of, and inaccurate information."
