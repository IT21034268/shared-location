5,The best book on Pagan Gods,All too often the Pagan God is forgotten in favor of the Goddess. This book will bring the balance back to our lives. It gives the history of many well know Gods as well as many not so well known Ones. It also includes rituals in direct relation to the Gods listed. I love this book! It goes well with The Witches' Goddess!
4,"Best PUR CD, but not just the music is important","This is definetely the best PUR CD ever, but I've to add that the lyrics of this band are very important and if you don't understand them, you'd like it much less. I don't say anything against the music with that, but the words have at least the same importance."
5,Beautiful Submission,"What struck me the most all throughout the reading of ""Beauty and submission"" is the power and bravery behind Maria Pita's prose. She is undoubtedly a wise old soul. Yet, in the same instance, her no-holds-barred honesty about the lifestyle and personal odyssey with her beloved Dom has a youthful innocence that refreshes and renews like rain in the springtime. Love is new, and forever renewed, by each other. Life obstacles faced by most vanilla lovers face are present along with the countless obstacles any alternative lifestyle will bring. Every such mountain is a challenge scaled with intelligent and triumphant results. Missa's enormous heart, and huge capacity to love and submit to her man in the purest sense, will stay with me (and I'm sure all her readers) long after this book is closed. This real life romance makes fictional renditions pale in comparison."
1,Where was the editor?,"Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues)."
2,"Like a train wreck, you want to look away, but you can't.","I picked up Beauty & Submission on a whim, after reading the back cover. I have recently begun to read a few BDSM and thought this book would help broaden my knowledge of the submissive aspect. I was disappointed with the outcome.I thought the book held more issues with jealousy and swinging than the day-to-day life of a lifestyle submissive. I also thought that the slave seemed to switch between a dominant/submissive role. There were quite a few references to watersports which were personally not my cup o' tea, as you might say.I did not enjoy all the pages where she ""quoted"" from her other novels. I believe the book would have been half the size if these would have been cut from the copy. It felt like an attempt to sell her other books."
3,Disregard the earlier reviews of this album.,"The information provided by both the professional and customer reviewers for this album does not pertain to this specific title. Although I recommend Distant Light instead of this title, this one features the vocals of Allan Clarke in a similar vein and context to two albums that appeared a few years earlier: the aforementioned Distant Light and Romany.Clarke's vocal work here is admirable; the group itself appears to have shed its Top Pop radio persona (although The Air That I Breathe did do well on the charts), and offer a more mature and thoughtful collection of tunes."
3,Need More Information,"This listing does not indicate the bonus tracks that are included. So, I don't know which version of the album this is.The one to get, of course, is the latest version which includes the previously unreleased bonus tract ""Burn Fire Burn.""I wish I knew if this CD has that song."
4,Arizona Diamondbacks 59Fifty Hat,"The product came in about 3 days after ordering. The hat fits well and 59Fifty finally put in a black hat liner in the inside of the hat, which I like. I wish the ""A"" logo was bigger."
1,Beware of packaging,"Sorry I know this is supposed to be a review of the item, but I want my complaint heard by anyone that might buy it. The hat itself is great, if you buy it at the store. New Era hats have large bills and a tall crown, but as long as you don't have a tiny head it will look fine. My complaint was that they shipped me this hat in a dvd box. Seriously. The hat was completely flattened, leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo. Ruined hat if you ask me, and will be returning immediately. You're probably better off buy this item in a hat store and spend the extra few dollars, at least they will have treated it right up to that point."
1,Tiene que ser sensilla!!,"Quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama, talento, y bellesa que esta mujer tiene? No tiene voz suave, ni fuerte. Deveria dedicarse a otra cosa. Lo que sea.. menos cantar, y actuar porque seria igual de ridicula que Patty Navidad!! Este es uno de los peores Discos que he escuchado en toda mi vida!!"
1,Ha Ha Ha,"Why is she not famous? I agree with the other smart reviewer, because she STINKS! Wow does she stink! I had no choice but to throw her CD in the trash. I wasn't going to torture anyone by giving them this CD as a present! No way! I just THREW IT AWAY!"
2,I couldn't get into it,"I just coulAfter getting more than 50% through the book, I had to stop ... I just couldn't get into it and didn't like the writting style."
3,Ok read,I'm a history lover but will read novels and memoirs. There were points in the book were the author lost me. However not much said about the mother. Title is not good for this book.
2,Not complimentary.,This book really disappointed me. It seems like a narrative. No real plot just a rambling repetitive narration of a poor island child. I wish I could say I loved it....but felt really let down.
3,difficult,"When first buying this book I throught it was gonna be about the author's mother. The book is about this girl name Xuela, who's mother died giving birth to her. Xuela father gave her to the woman who washed his clothes, and only visted every now and then. Xuela eventually moved back in with him and his new family only to move again with another family. I throught Xuela was one of the strangest characthers i've ever read about. Her views on things were so strange. The other thing i didn't like about this book, it had no dialouge, which mean a lot of long paragraphs."
1,Repetitive and monotone,"I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly."
1,Disappointing,"I had hoped to read a colorful story about life in the Caribbean, and was not expecting the story to be happy and uplifting. However, I was disappointed to discover that the most prevalent topics in the book were the character's bodily smells, excretions, and sex life. I was left wondering what these aspects of the book had to do with the character's mother."
2,"A fast, but mostly unpleasant read",This is the story of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seek out any joy in her life. The overall feeling of the story is negative and depressing.
1,Worst book I've ever read,"This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I ""attempted"" to read by the author, since I couldn't waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade."
1,Puzzling,"After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' ""The Stranger"", I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found ""Autobiography of my Mother"" completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in ""The Stranger"", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white ""conquerers"" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"
4,Sad story - hopeless afterlife,Losing a mom - never knowing your mom - living your life in anger. Sad. No redemption. It made me sad that some people stay in that state and do not find the only answer which is Jesus Christ. But I know this is true for many who's hearts remain hard who have a big God void in their lives. It was an interesting story....but very hopeless and sad.
3,The Autobiography of My Mother,I thought it very wordy and drawn out and very slow reading. I would have liked a little more ooph in it.
2,The autobiography of my mother,Did not really get lost in there book....found it boring....and I really wanted to stop reading it! But chose to painstakingly finish it..
1,The autobiography of my mother,It's not a book I'll ever read again. It was very boring. Glad I didn't pay that much. I give it a star.
2,repetitive,"This book has flowery language and the story line seems to have potential but the book never goes any where. I skimmed much of it, hoping it would develop plot and character, but it really never did. The plot and language were repetitive and didn't hold my attention. It seemed as though the author had a point she was trying hard to get to but it just never happened."
1,Pseudo-nihilistic garbage. A waste of paper and ink.,"What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work"
1,Do I have to give it a star?,"Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the ""wetness between [her] legs"", or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."
1,Don't buy this book,"Jean Giorno assigned rights to this story to the public domain. Unscrupulous, evil American publishers are acting contrary to the author's intent and prostituting this work by cracking down on English language versions (including online versions), even new translations from the French. Don't give your money to greed heads who are 180 degrees in conflict with the principles of this book."
2,"disappointing, confusing, not an good intro to snmp","This was not a good first book to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. As an example, the definition of a subtype I found in another text (a subset of the value set for a type) was quite clear, then I checked the Simple definition of subtype and found its was useful to ""refine the semantics"" of a ""data object"" and that ""it may be useful to create a new data type for strings using other repertoires, such as ASCII"". The author also notes that the ""ASN.1 rules for subtyping are long and complex"". (p 34-35). Hello? This book may be useful as a reference after reading other, better written introductions, but avoid it if you are new to SNMP. Also, I recommend that the novice learn ASN.1 first, rather than alsong with SNMP in a combined text. Also, SNMPv2 has yet to catch on, the Simple book focuses primarily on this version, not of much interest if you are working with version 1."
1,Reading an RFC is more fun and more informative too!,"The editor and publisher of this book should be ashamed. It is an extended rant by the author that has no business being bound in hard cover. The Pine Mountain Group recommends excerps from this book to get up to speed with SNMP. I wonder who at PMG is friends with the author. This book will teach only members of the ""network management community"" anything. Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic. The shame of it is that this author could educate profoundly if a good editor enforced some discipline or a co-author came in to help with communicating with those who are not the author's peers."
1,"Not just disappointed, angered.","It's hard to believe that this book was released by a major publisher. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical errors. The thin index is almost useless, as a close examination reveals it to be mostly a list of the author's friends and their nicknames."
2,Horrible for beginners; no comment as a reference,"I am a developer with 8 years experience but novice to Network programming. A friend suggested this book as a first and default one to start with. I am completely disappointed. It's not a practical, jump-into it, internet-age book. Let me see if it serves any purpose as a reference. BTW, the CD is totally useless. It has only a few files which you can anyway download for free."
2,Disappointing that Amazon's Price is 15.00 more than at B&N,Book has some interesting insight but does little to develop technical understanding. Is cheaper at B&N locally
4,A warm farewell to our stranded friends on Tran-ky-ky.,"Prolific SF writer Alan Dean Foster wraps up the adventures of the stranded Ethan Fortune and Suka September on the ice planet of Tran-ky-ky in a nice little package for fans of the series. Turns out the thawing of the ice at the equator Ethan saw in the second book (Mission to Moulkin) was not natural at all, someone is actually attempting to thaw out the planet. That could mean possible extinction for the Tran, which is unexceptable to Fortune and September. They and their Tran friends head out on the Slanderscree to see that the process is stopped, permanently. A wonderful ending to a wonderful series, highly recommended."
5,St. Rose of Lima: the First Canonized Saint in the Americas,"Excellent read, for children or for any age; also for adults who want to get to know Saint Rose of Lima."
4,New Toe jaming sounds,Shows a sense of creativity with sound effects that reveals the artist's ability to be in touch with todays concerns. Loved the Twist!
2,poetic but excessive,"I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than novels."
5,Wonderful app,"I love reading Essence magazine, I am happy I can now read it on my kindle fire. I recommend this"
2,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing!!!!!,"I'm thinking of cancelling my subscription. Ever since Time Warner Publishing acquired Essence, it seems to be cantering to dark-skinned white women and NOT Black women."
5,Delivered As Promised,"I LOVE Essence and I am quite pleased with the delivery and maintence by Amazon, I receive it like clockwork each month!"
4,Essence,"I love the magazine, but I would love to receive it before I see it on the news stands or at least the same day."
3,Essence Magazine Review,"ESSENCE magazine is one of the finest magazines for progressive Black women and occasionally for Black men. I recommend a subscription to my friends, family and people who want to borrow my copy. The staff, writers and contributors are top notch. Most of the articles are educational, conscious raising and encourages self-growth. The fashion, hair and beauty sections are well done with excellent photo's. As a whole, a subscription to ESSENCE magazine is well-worth the cost."
1,where my copy,Cant rate something that I have yet to get a copy of. I feel like I calomst could have done better by going to the store and buying it. I have yet to get my first copy of the magazine
2,"too many ads, not enough interesting material","i was hoping to gain some entertainment while reading things that will keep my interest but like most magazines, this was full of ads and the articles either seemed generic or just didnt keep my attention."
2,Could Easily break a tooth,"So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor."
3,limited multi-function,"I bought this to replace the cheap one I have which comes with 8 different usb tips, 1 of which doesn't work. Instead of having the same variety of tips as mine, it come with 6, 4 of which are 2 telephone and 2 network jacks. The extension cord had too much thought put into it. Instead of the regular ""zipit"" type cord, this is bigger and has both ends of the cord coming out the same side and uses a button to retract the cord. Not a problem just doesn't work for me. The tips are well made and is of sturdy construction, I think the pouch is just stupid. Fortunately I can mix and match the two to cover all of my needs."
2,Zero Resolution,"I'm sure I am one of a select few that do not appreciate a story that develops great characters and great sub-plots and then ends abruptly. It's almost as though the author got bored and quit - Zero resolution on anything. It doesn't leave me wanting more because I know the same feeling of ""What the Hell?"" will be waiting for me in the next book."
4,Inventive and Refreshing,"I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this book. Fast paced, detailed characters, original story, and an epic feel make this a great read. I haven't liked other Koontz before, but I guess Kevin J. Anderson helped pull Dean up to his level. I look forward to the continuing story -- especially by veteran writer Ed Gorman."
5,Koontz is always good,this book is very good as I have come to expect of Dean KoontzI've been reading his books as long as he has been writing them and am never disappointedI wish the 3rd book was coming sooner but i'll take it when I can get it
5,Best yet!,"I have always been a fan of Dean Koontz's books and when my flight was grounded and I was to spend the night in the airport, I figured I'd better get myself a book to keep me entertained. That's exactly what this book did. I enjoyed reading it so much that I almost missed my connecting flight back home because I didn't want to put the book down.It's unique, fresh and fast paced. If you enjoyed the original Frankenstein story, you will adore this ""updated"" and more complete modern version. You will not be disappointed!"
2,Ok but nothing great,Its not a bad book but I expected more. I didnt find myself locked into it waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to put it down. One thing I didnt like is the chapters are tiny. It doesnt really let you get into one part of the story before its switched to another. I think they did this to imply fast action and keep you always expecting the next thing but it didnt work for me. I wont buy the next book in the series.
5,Not into monsters...unless Koontz is The Creator,"One has suggested the Decaulion character lacked depth. Another has hinted that the ending lacked surprise (must have been reading a different book). Remember two things: Koontz wrote it, and it's Book One. We will get into the mystery of the original ""monster"" (Decaulion) and we readers will find many surprises and twists as the story continues to unfold.That being said, I loooooved this book. This is a fun, intriguing look at the evil Doc Frankenstein, who was certainly a monster before chopping his own body up to become yet more so. Dr. F., impervious to aging and disease after 200 years, has been a busy bee, building and perfecting more monsters. But things are starting to go terribly wrong for New Orleans and for the Doctor we love to hate.Read it, you'll love it."
4,3.5 Stars,"I struggled with how to review this book. As usual I picked up this book, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein book 1, when I was traveling somewhere to read and take my mind off the flight. It worked and the book was good. But really, could they not have made the print smaller and made two books just one book? The book did not have the bite of other Koontz novels, but he did share the writing. It is a bit far fetched, but it is a good update on the classic work Frankenstein. Overall - B JVD"
5,Koontz is getting even better over time.,"This is a wonderful twist on the classic. The characters are very well rounded and I was grabbed from the beginning. I now and then ponder how the biologically impossible events in the book could actually be brewing in someones own lab at this very moment. Mr. Koontz takes today's traditional underdog and makes him not someone to pity but someone to perhaps admire. My only negative on the book is that I am hooked and will make sure I quickly purchase the next in the series.If you like seeing the dark side of life let in a little light, you will undoubtedly become a Koontz addict as have I. Don't plan on doing anything else until you finish this one.I also highly recommend THE FACE. Another dark side trying to usurp the light. Excellent, excellent, excellent books."
5,Koontz's BEST book,"I have to admitt that I am not as big a book reader as I used to be. However, when I saw this book in the store I couldn't resist.The idea of making a remake of the classic book was exciting and possibly to like the original. Let me tell you upfront that this book was GREAT!!!! It is the fastest I've ever read a book (4 days); I could not put it down. This book is very direct in the plot, and easy to follow the chapter changes. Koontz writes the characters in a way that you can truely understand exactly what they're feeling, and you can sympathize with even the dubious villians. I hope you take the time to read this book, IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!!!PS- The next part to this book is set to be released in July 2005 :)"
4,"Great start to a ""Mimi-Series"" Frankenstein","I'm pleasantly suprised. I have read K.Anderson 'novelizations',and been a long time DK fan, and so far I am really enjoyingthe series. I wont re-iterate the Editorial Write-Up. You canalso go to DK's web page and get a synopsis of all the maincharacters. Looking forward to the next installment."
2,Give me an ending,"A decent story that gets you to turn the pages. The problem is, there aren't enough pages. The story just ends leaving you in the middle of an action sequence. I don't like paying $8 for a book that leaves you forced to buy the next one in a series. I don't mind series (thought I'm not that much into them), but each book in a series should stand alone."
4,Best Frankenstein Story that I have read,"The idea to keep the original story intact and just bring us a new chapter 200 years later is just great! The story, as usual with a Koontz book, unfolds at break neck speed. I mean it never lows down, right up to the very last page! Be forwarned, there is nothing that even comes close to closure in this book. Its as if they wrote the entire story and picked the most suspenceful parts and end the book there. Then smiling , they watch as we anxiously wait for next volume to come.If you like Koontz, horror or SiFi please go out and get this book. But take one word of advice, you may want to wait till we are a little closer to the release date for the second book. I'm in anguish knowing I have to wait four months!"
2,Disappointing!,The repetition of information and slow pace gave this book the feel of elementary school reading material. This series could have been condensed into one book and it would have been the better for it. I gave it two stars for the infrequent plot twists that got me through the book rather than throwing it away.
1,It's Garbage.,"Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his ""perfect race"" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and ""at one with the universe"" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole ""story"" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."
2,Not Dean Koontz's best,"This Frankenstein series started off with 3 1/2 stars and deteriorated downward with every new volume. Not up to Mr. Koontz's standard of edge of your seat, nail biting suspense I've come to love."
4,Awesome....,"This is my first Dean Koontz novel, highly suggested reading by my mother of all people! I really enjoyed this story of a modern day Frankenstein monster created by an even bigger monster. There were quite a few stories intertwined in this book, all presumably leading up to an ending.Which brings me to why I did not give this book 5 stars. While it was very well written and edited, it was left with a huge cliffhanger. I understand this is part of a series but I personally prefer for a book to be somewhat wrapped up before going onto the next one. This book just suddenly ended in the middle of a scene. Anyway, I'll be getting the rest of the books (of course!), because I know good quality writing when I see it."
4,LOVED IT!,"This was a great read! The mad scientist return & theres so much mystery its very intriguing. However, I did find it to be a bit confusing with so many charecters to keep up with in order to understand the whole storey & how it meshes into Frankenstien but Im glad I read it :)"
3,Prodigal Son- Dean Koonz,"Not the usual Koonz intrigue, but I can see that it would have made a great tv series. Rather predictable, but no more so than ""Supernatural"". I'll buy the series anyway. Koonz entertains and leaves each book begging for more of it's ""heros"""
3,The Prodigal Son,"I've wanted to start this series for over a year now, so the anticipation could have led to my disappointment.While the ending of the book was pretty good, it took a long time to get there. There were a lot of characters introduced and I spent most of the book trying to figure out why. It became apparent towards the end, but the journey was a little disappointing to me. I wanted more of Deucalion as he was a very vivid character to me, but he was barely in the book. I have a feeling that the next book in the series may be a little more exciting so I'm going to give it read. I just hope that we've had enough back ground information given in Prodigal Son so that City of Night can be the page turner I'm hoping for."
4,A New Look at an Old Story,"I'm not much of a Dean Koontz fan; his tendency to use `deus ex machina' to resolve plots and such has always put me off. I'm also not much of a fan of the horror genre anyway, so I rarely read Koontz. However I had heard a bunch about this series, including the rumor that Martin Scorsese had at one time expressed in interest in producing it for TV. Anyway, I was really kind of glad to read this and see that Koontz had put a little life and a novel twist to the old story. I'm actually looking forward to the next two parts."
5,Dean Koontz's Frankenstein,"I have loved Dean Koontz for years but his books of late have gotten away from the reason I fell in love with his stories... All I can say is HE'S BACK! I can't wait for the 2nd book!! I could not put this down,it made me breathless the whole way through!"
3,Good story but uneven,"I enjoyed the story but there were uneven parts that didn't contribute to the story and just felt thrown in. In addition, I was often glad that I was reading this story on my Kindle because I needed to look up several unfamiliar words and some words were so far outside of common use that they were not even in the Kindle dictionary."
3,A GOOD STORY,This is a good story with an interesting twist to the plot.But...cliffhanger ending indeed.I like my books to have an ending.I do not like to have!! to read the next book in the series to find out what happens to the characters in the current story.So do not start this series if you do not have in hand all 3 books.Rachell Youngman
4,Koontz nailed it!,"I'd only read the first three Odd Thomas books of Koontz's, but thought I'd try Frankenstein, because the review on Amazon said it was not a rehash of the old tale. And, it wasn't. It's a refreshing twist on the resurfacing of the madman (he was never destroyed, and actually resents that Shelley woman's story), but with a clean dash of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a pinch of James Lee Burke's detective angle, all with a flavor of hi-test horror. I'm starting on Vol 2 tonight!"
5,Forget Mary Shelly,"Well actually, no. Of course not. Nothing can top the original. But Koontz comes at this classic tale with his own scythe ready to cause a change of faith in the fans of the original. This is not so much a remake as a supplement to the classic tale. Koontz references the story we all now and simply fast-forwards to our time, keeping the original Victor and his monster, and giving them longevity.The prose is ellegant and the speed is neck-breaking. It appears that Mr. Koontz uses 'big' words and paints detailed scenarios that may intimidate some readers, but I challenge you to read his work out loud - you'll see how nicely the words roll off your tongue."
5,A better Dean Koontz,I've always liked Dean Koontz. This one however is different from his others. It is still a fast read; I found hard to put down. I have already ordered the second and have started on it. This is one saga I won't want to end.
3,Not Exactly What I Thought . . .,"A pretty decent story. However, the book was marketed (in my opinion) as a retelling of the classic tale with a new ""spin"" on things. This is not the case. In actuality, this is a CONTINUATION of the classic tale, pulling Dr. Frankenstein and his monster into the present day."
1,Don't bother,"Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter. I kept trying to see if this would eventually grab me, but after maybe 10 chapters or so of plodding prose, I gave up. Thank goodness it was a library book."
4,"A solid, entertaining effort, if not Koontz's best","Book one of Dean Koontz's FRANKENSTEIN is a solid, entertaining read. I don't know if it should be taken as a conpliment or criticism of Koontz or Gorman, but I really couldn't tell which parts had been written by Koontz and which by Gorman (or whether Gorman wrote the whole thing, in the style of Koontz).Anyway, it's not Koontz's most original or forceful storytelling, but it passes the page-turning test. It kept me hooked until the end, and had me wanting to read the continuation in the second book.Koontz's FRANKENSTEIN lays bare, to a heightened extent, many of the faults and virtues of Koontz's writing in general. The novel is extremely readable, but it suffers from a patness of character and plotting. It's a good book, but not a great one.Still, a good book's a good book."
2,A good story but not great,I love Dean Koontz. This was not my favorite. In fact I was rather unhappy with the whole book. Now don't get me wrong he is a great writer but this book bored me. I don't read to get bored.
5,book,This is a gift for Christmas. I'm sure they will enjoy it. Had a hard time finding these books. Thanks
1,Fine until it started eating tapes,"Like many of the other reviewers, my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous ""Remove cassette"" message and is mangling tapes. I have used it to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years. Search the web for ""canon zr users group"" and ""eating tapes"" to hear similar horror stories. Stay away from Canon camcorders."
3,"Lights, lights, lights","Video gets grainy indoor. Other than that, i think everything is fine for the price i paid. 8/"
2,Neat package but very grainy indoor quality,"Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc."
3,OK entry level Camera,"I just purchased my ZR40 and I think it just barely gets by. The still photos are very grainy and in low light scenarios it does not perform well. The digital zoom is out standing, and it is very handy. I&#65533;ve only had it one week so I can&#65533;t say every much yet."
1,My [Goodness]!!!!,"world.....do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted [money]buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing [for less]including firewire, 4 dv's, and a carrying caseIt is honestly the worst, disgusting, and despicable electronic out thereif you get this you will have literallyliterally threw [your money]into the atlantic oceanDO NOT GET THIS EVEN IF SOMEONE PAYS FOR IT. RETURN IT. GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!"
2,Horrible motor noise,"Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera. I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it, so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it. I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera, but I figured I try it anyways. I bought it at Best Buy (should be called Worst Buy), and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise. You can't hear it while recording - it's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it. The motor noise is recorded in with your audio, so you hear a loud hummmm in the background. It was too loud for me to live with. If I was recording something with no background noise (like my baby playing), then it was as loud as his voice! ... I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound. We'll see..."
3,sound issues,"We have had the camera a week and did some taping indoors in a quiet room. When we did the playback through our television the sound was awful. The noise of the motor on the tape is very loud and distracting. We have heard better sound on older VHS camcorders. Is it because the camera is so small? Is there a fix for it? This has yet to be determined as we plan on calling Canon about it. We have read other reviews of other Canon models and also similar Sony camcorders with the same complaint. Sorry, but for this much money the sound is totally unacceptable. If you buy it we recommend taping a short bit and hooking up to your TV to see how it sounds before it is too late to return."
1,"always ""remove the tape"" message","I bought this model 18 months ago. Now it has big problem. I can't rewind the tape well. ""remove the tape"" mesasge always pop up. I sent it back to Canon for repair. They asked me $169 for repair. What can I say now? Too bad camcorder."
1,Awful Company. Awful Product. Run! Run! Run!,"Well where do I begin? After a month of use, the battery stopped working. Contacted Canon via email. They replied battery is not under warranty. Would you like to buy another one? Please.6 months later. I started transferring video to my computer only to find out this stupid camera eats tapes. I have lost two tapes so far. One of them was my son's birth!!!!The eating tapes issue is a major problem with this unit. They have known about it and continue to ignore it. Do a search on ""zr40 tape problems"" to see what I am talking about. There are even more results on sister product, zr10. I will never buy a product from Canon again. They are idiots for doing this to their customers."
5,Great Camcorder,"Excellent camcorder, does very well in all kinds of light. I have had no trouble with it indoors, and I find that it performs very well in low light. Flawlessly performs with Windows Movie Maker 2 through firewire. The sound is outstanding, considering the picture is it's strong point. I did not need the digital camera built in as I already have one. Effects are fun to play around with, especially with the handy scroll button. I have not heard the motor noise at all, so I can't see where that is coming from. My only complaint is that it shuts off too quickly if inactive, but it's really not that much of a problem. Image stablizer works really well, as I often have an unsteady hand but it is hardly noticeable with this camcorder. I just wish they made a VCR that could record the footage as well as it was taped!"
1,Worst Product I have Owned,"As many others have reported, this Zr40 began eating tapes with only a few hours of use on it. I have lost many precious moments recorded on tape because of the tape loading problem.The only good thing I can say about this camera is the bag was large enough to hold my Nikon P100. The Canon is going in the trash."
4,Great camera for the money,I have used the camera for a month and am impressed by its features and picture quality. I agree with the other reviewers that indoor shoots require good lighting. I bought a video light and it helped a lot. Outdoor footage with sunshine is superb! If you are new to the video world (like I am) this camera is all you need to get started.
5,"Great Music, and A Lot of It, At A Great Price","This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music, and the title track is the final piece, a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said, the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like, but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties, besides being the first, this one is more immediately accessible, because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work, not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell, 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City', less cerebral than Cecil Taylor, and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension', but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world."
5,Different isn't always good--sometimes it's better,"I'm a commercial pilot and flight instructor. I read many aviation related books and magazines. I don't often read books that contain a lot of poetry, which AIR FARE does.(It also has short stories and excerpts from longer works.) So to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little wonder of a book is an understatement.My advice? If you've never flown but wonder what it's like, you should read this book. If you have flown as a passenger, you'll recognize your own emotions, both good and bad, in every page. If you are a pilot, you'll see yourself reflected in myriad indelible images; you'll be drawn back by memory to a hundred different experiences; and you'll want to read-and reread-each and every privileged glimpse into the human heart of flight, and be left wanting more. It's a must-have for any aviator's library. Get it!"
3,Right on the money but hard to read,"I give this book three stars because everything the author says is right on the money. I did not give it 5 stars because the book is repetitious and the language rambling. I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I had trouble finishing it. I would have liked less preaching about liberating yourself and more insights on how to do it from examples of people who have done it. There are examples, but not as many as I would have liked, and not described in enough depth.I gained more insights from ""Gifted Grownups"" by Marylou Kelly Streznewski. Her section about the physiology of giftedness, in particular, covered material I have not seen anywhere else.In the end, how much you enjoy this book will depend much on how comfortable you are with your giftedness. If you have not become comfortable with being ""different"", you will probably value this book. If you are comfortable with the real gifted you, this is probably not the book for you."
5,Give a copy to your teenage children!,"Read this book as soon as possible. It is so jam filled (malaprop intended) with wisdom and knowledge and so well written with passion and power. Give a copy to each of your teenage children, nieces and nephews! They need this stuff at as young an age as possible.And once you've read it, you must readYour Own Worst Enemy: Breaking the Habit of Adult Underachievementwhich gets down to the nitty gritty of breaking the bad habits that gifted people edge into because of their own gifted pride."
2,Anesthesia for the gifted,"I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains."
2,Mediocre,"This is a mediocre book at best. The tests give you an illusion that you are a genius too. It is full of self fullfiling falacies. If you think you are a genius, you are... maybe not. Just review your scores on the SAT, GMAT, GRE, or whatever test you have taken. If you did not score in the top percentile, don't call yourself a genius because the tests within these books said so. That is if you don't want to embarass yourself in public, or even in private company.There are far better books out there on how to train and develop your multiple intelligences. This is not the one.Check authors like Michael Gelb, Tony Buzan, Thomas Armstrong, Howard Gardner, and David Coleman. They have developed a ton of serious well researched materials and methods on this subject. They all provide far better stuff than this book."
2,I was promised new!!,"well, they promised me ""NEW"" but this book is far from being new. Marking all over the book means it's not new, the cover torn at some parts means that this isn't new!!"
5,A fine novel about a forgotten time,Houston exaggerates for effect--not all of the historical characters that he uses were actually at Bisbee. But how could anyone resist using the bigger-than-life leaders of the IWW?
3,Nothing new,"At all, the CD is ok, but before it was published I expected that there would be more new songs on the CD. Except for two, all songs are old ones from older CDs. That's not a reason to give a bad rate, because some songs are much, much different and better than the studio songs from the older CDs."
5,Works Great!,The shorter length of this rod is exactly what we needed for our shower. Tension rods in this length are difficult to find and we were glad to buy this one. Great product.
4,Good Product,"Works great, looks more classy than the plain white ones for curtain hanging and it's strong enough to hold curtains. The end piece was a lot smaller than I thought. I thought it would be maybe 2.5 inches in diameter, but it's only about 1. (I didn't measure it.)"
2,Not exceptional,"As other reviewers have stated, these curtain rods will not sustain much weight at all. They really aren't spring rods - you just twist it into place.I ordered 3 and they were so poorly packed that two of them were bent and completely unusable.I wouldn't bother with these, or buy them from Country Curtains because you can get an anchor so that they can hold more weight and be more stable. Of course, their $30 each instead of $19!!!!"
1,shipped wrong color,"I ordered three rods (all black) of various sizes and received free shipping. When the order was received, one of the rods was in pewter. They agreed to send a return shipping label for the incorrect item, but I would have to pay shipping on one rod."
4,From Back Cover,"The Man Who Came for Christmas...The last thing Peggy Jo Riley wanted this holiday was a hard-boiled charmer in her house 24/7. But if she wanted to stay alive, she needed Jack Parker. And once she was in Jack's well-muscled arms, she realized just houw much she needed him...Up until the moment he'd seen desire flicker in her pretty eyes, bodyguard Jack Parker had thought Peggy Jo Riley was just another assignment. But the vulnerability he'd glimpsed under his cool beauty's armor made him ache to do a whole lot more for Peggy Jo. Like kiss her till she gave him her trust. And love her til she gave him her heart..."
4,Dainty,"This item is very beautiful and dainty, but a lot smaller than I thought. The stones could also be better, but the design is so catching that it makes up for it. I should also add that Charoite is a very hard stone to find at a good price, so if you are looking at affordable, this is it. Trust me, I spent several hours searching. Overall I really like this pendant."
5,Recommend for young musicians,This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration. It tells a brief story in an easy to read format for each musician for a variety of instruments. Good for those who have the potential to go professional.
4,interesting reading,When you see an orchestra perform it look like the people in it play effortlessly. This is not the case. They get to be that great through LOTS of practice! In Meet the Musicians we are introduced to 15 member if the New York Philharmonic. They tell us there stories of how they found out they really wanted to be professionals.The book included a helpful glossary and a list of resources for learining.Young musicians will gain useful advise from the pro in this book.
3,Massacre at Fort William Henry.,"A little history about the novel & especially the movie,""Last of the Mohicans"" The book tells about the historythe the war they were fighting and the why about thehorrific massacre scene on the trail from Fort WilliamHenry in the movie."
5,Delightful - Magic and Romance,"Ghosts, Time Travel, Fairies, Magic and Scotland figure in this delightful story. I liked it. I had one little wish -- I got a bit confused with the love scenes - wish they were a little more detailed and longer."
4,good fantasy romance,"This book, though not ""great literature"", is a fun read, with plenty of romance and suspense. But you have to be willing to temporarily (for the duration of reading the book) believe in magic, including magical time travel, to let yourself get into the story. This book does have an engrossing, suspenseful story line in addition to the romance, so it is much better than those romance books that are simply an evolving romance held together by boring daily life events. I recommend it as good entertainment reading."
1,Long and involved,Had a hard time following the story. Typos in dates really had me confused Malcolm was introduced in 1864 not 1964.
4,Credit for a good cause...but not 5 stars.,"This CD gets two stars for the good intentions and two for a couple good songs, but not worthy of five stars. I hate to be critical of charity efforts, but it just doesn't have that extra spark. None of the mixes especially strike me as really creative or original. I do love the dance version of Barry Manilow's ""Could It Be Magic"" and Sting's ""Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot"", and a couple other songs are worth a listen, but there are other CD's that I like better. For a great CD with some cool mixes that just blend together like you wouldn't believe, try Fire Island Classics (I like #1 best). For party music, the oddly-titled ""Gay Dancing"" is a really great mix of familiar songs. Dance with Angels is all well-known names and some great songs, but again, the mix just doesn't do much for me as a dance mix."
1,The music is old and tired at this point.,The music has been out. What is the purpose of it? Forget it
4,Pretty Good,Pretty good manga.I'm in my twenties and this is one of the mangas I've really enjoyed.Its not like MARS :(But still good!
2,Just Unnecessary,"As any fan of Nirvana is well aware, Kurt Cobain had a fear that was close to outright paranoia about Nirvana's music being milked and exploited to make a buck. All of a sudden, that fear seems totally legitimate.This is (basically) the 3rd ""Greatest Hits"" cd that's been released under the band's banner. Nirvana only had three studio released cds. Well ... four if you count 'Incesticide.'If you're a younger fan and you want a terrific introduction to the band's work save your money from cd and save up for the 'With the Lights Out' box-set. It doesn't cost too much and is a great way to break into the band.A true Nirvana fan understands that the only meaning behind this piece is dollar signs."
2,Buy the box set instead of this!,All it is the summary of the boxset i guess for the budget nirvana fan? the reason i am giving it 2 stars all it had to offer was a track not included in the box set which is the come as you are demo.. the box set is alot more expensive but has alot more to offer than this and you get a decent dvd to watch all in all a buy for the hardcore nirvana fan... also the art work was originally picked out by Frances Bean Cobain and thats a good thing! other than that buy the box set
2,Poor value for money,"I agree with most people that this is an un-necessary release. It is an obvious attempt to cash in by the holders of the rights. But on the other hand it is also a cheaper alternative to the 'With the lights out box'. I own the box and can honestly say it is definitely worth the extra money to buy that. This doesn't even offer the best of the box anyway, which it clear states in the title. I only bought this because I like to own anything and everything with the Nirvana name on it. I believe Nirvana are the most influencial band since the Beatles and any unheard recording of the bands I must have.Only hardcore fans will want to buy this, it only offers 3 previously unreleased recording of which only two are any good. 'Sappy' and a 1985 recorded version of 'Spank Thru' which surely must be the first ever recording by Nirvana.As far as value for money goes, this doesn't have anything to offer, sadly."
1,Smells like dollar signs...,"Have you ever heard the song 'Milk It'? It was written for this exact reason. Or 'Rape Me'? ""Its so relieving to know that your leaving as soon as you get paid"" Francis farmer? You know when you buy this, some record exec is making a buck on a dead persons name. But hey we all know that suicide sells."
2,Ehh,The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case.
1,Why keep on going with this crap?,"It is more of the same, it is more of the one of the worst band that existed. Nirvana was never good, it was music for depressive people. Skip on this one that it is being release to fill the pockets of her stupid daughter and his stupid ex wife. Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the most worst band of all times."
1,"""True"" Nirvana sucks","I'll tell you what's REALLY in the spirit of the band: that FBI seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are ""illegal"". Not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway. If this is ""true"" Nirvana, then ""true"" Nirvana sucks."
1,garbage,"Complete garbage, the sound quality is horrible, if your going to release a best of cd, record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a wet rag."
1,Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn't,"Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was."
3,please understand,If you are just starting to listento Nirvana or you are not a big fan dong get this get Nevermind or any other of thier cds these are thier demos and home recordings and basicly only a few are worth listing to like Sappy - Rape me- Old Age-Do Re Mi-and most of them the guitars sounds bad and untuned and the qualitly is bad but if you are a die hard fan check out the songs u have never herd
1,Completely Useless,"I don't quite understand why Courtney is allowed to put these things out, and even more surprised that the other members agreed to it (since they have to). Everyone who already put out the 50 bucks for the box gets a whole three song bonus, songs which don't even sound like anything special. Nirvana was an awesome band who made some of the greatest music of all time, and this CD does reflect that. It's a good CD, but it's useless. It's nothing we don't already have. If they're going to put more Nirvana stuff out, it should at least be stuff we haven't heard. Just buy the three songs off of iTunes or something and save yourself the money from buying this CD."
3,OK Album,"I am a HUGE fan of Nirvana and own every album. I have to admit, I own the ""With the lights out"" box set but I still bought this album, for the three bonus tracks not released on the big box set."
1,Tasteless Trash,"If I could give this half of a star I would. I am a big fan of Nirvana, but this was a total disappointment to me. The tracks sounded awful. I felt like I was ripped off in every sense of the way. I took it to a buy-trade-sell place and not even they would offer me anything for it, which shows you the poor quality of this album. A word of advice; DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,$ Scam,"The songs on Sliver are easily some of the best of the box but the completely ignored some of the best, also. Its said for me to watch the ""Nirvana Corp."" aka Courtney Love to do something like this. Ultimately, if you don't realize that this is a shtik for $ then you must be confused. Nirvana released a best of cd and then a best of the box? Im just guessing but i think this is what the record company was saying:""We'll throw a couple new songs on it and we'll get some true fans to buy it just to have it.""It's been released for the cash. And this is something I know Kurt wouldnt have approved of. Hopefully someone takes this into consideration before buying it. yea,its good for the collection but its sad to see this is happening. I bought it for the cover art and stuff just to have for the collection nothing more. If your looking for some music get the actual box set."
1,Don't Buy,This is the worst recording of Nirvana I have ever heard! The entire thing sounds horrible. DON'BUY IT!!
2,Thought I was missing more than this...,"I don't own the box set but, if this is the best of the box then I'm not missing much. I really like Nirvana but there really just aren't many winners here especially since this is suppose to be the pick of the litter from ""With the lights out"".There are a few solid tracks here but I just expected more..."
3,ironic,"Back in '86-'87 when I was introduced to Nirvana, I thought, ""Okay,another punk revival band from the PNW. Not bad, not particularly good.""So, when they went and got themselves all Butch Vig'd out andcommericial, it was just another reason to distrust ""production value.""Sure, there were some great SubPop bands, (how about The Posies on thesub-SubPop label Pop LLama!) but for the most part they were adistraction. Essentially, the irony is that for most music fans under,say 35, this revamped box set is a marketing slap in the face. Inactuality, it's probably the best way to approach Nirvana. They SHOULDbe remembered as a punk garage act as oppossed to the ""ground breaking""grunge band that unfortunately popped-up punk. The clean sound of""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and it's subsequent effect on popular music isa sad comment on the commercialization of a musical genre that wasalways a humorous, irreverent form with a DIY ethic. Take Nirvana atface value, that's what you'll get with ""Sliver."""
3,The Adolescents-'Complete Demos 1980-1986'(Frontier),"Until I got this disc,I've never even heard of this Southern California hardcore punk band,which existed between 1980-1989.Total of sixteen tracks.Even though it's cutting room floor material,the music is decent.I usually enjoy hearing a band's demos ANYWAY.I know that many fans out there don't.Sometimes a demo CAN sound better than the actual lp version.Tunes that had me leaving this CD in my 'current rotation stack' were ""Black Sheep"",""No Friends"",""Wrecking Crew"",""Do The Eddie""(good guitar playing)and ""Richard Hung Himself"".Line-up:Tony Reflex-vocals,Frank Agnew-guitar,Steve Soto-bass and Casey Royer-drums.Should appeal to fans of Bad Brains,Fugazi,Fear,Minor Threat and Agent Orange.Enjoy!"
3,Not Bad,"Five of the best tracks here have previously been tacked onto the great ""Live 1981 and 86"" cd. If you already own that, you're left with some early, bratty basement or garage recordings of first-set songs that got quickly dumped from their repertoire, which are interesting but not too listenable, and a few more pre-Blue album demos, including the awesome ""Creatures"" and ""Amoeba"". A worthy purchase for those tunes alone, in my opinion."
1,Very easy to solve!,"This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Buy the ""original"" ""Don't Break the Bottle"", it will keep you entertained much longer."
3,Intresting,"i got this as a gag gift for my bf's mom. Took her a little bit to figure out. When she got the wine out, we put it back togehter and passed it around! it's a pretty cool gift!"
4,studded latigo dog collar,Product was as advertised. Very high quality. Product arrived in less time than anticipated. My dog Buddy looks very sharp wearing this collar. I would highly recomend company and product to anyone seeking a high quality leather studded dog collar.
5,Sensiblity and jarana.,"The fisrt time I fist met Son de Madera on a live show in the city of Oaxaca, Mex. It's a very talented group, originary from the state of Veracruz, they made a ""rescue"" of the original Jarochan Son, Laura's voice its one of the best of Jarochan Son. their music leads you to tropical and apassionated world of the mexican jarochan soul.La primera vez que conoci a Son de Madera fue en una presentación en cico enla ciudad de Oaxaca, mex. Son un grupo talentoso originario del estado de Veracruz. Ellos hicieron un ""rescate"" del son jarocho original. La voz de laura es una de las mejores del Son Jarocho. Su m'sica te conduce al tropical y apasionado mundo del alma Jarocha de México."
4,"In spite of age, still a good reference on the subject","In spite of the age of this work, and the fact it was directed to a young audience, it is well written and contains a great deal of useful information. Indeed, until very, very recently it was the ***only*** book that had any useful data on Dark Age warriors. Fortunately, more recent scholarship has come in to help fill the gap, but this is still a very useful work.Amazingly, it has not been reprinted with the rest of Oakeshott's series on Knights - why, I have no clue, for it is the best of the series that I have seen thus far, and is still extremely useful.Buy this if you can, which will not be easy unless a reprint is made - I lucked into a copy from Bookfinder and counted myself quite blessed."
4,Oakeshott was a Scholar,"While this is not one of his major books and written a long time ago Oakeshott got the details right according to what was known about the subject then, and it's a good introduction now decades later. I have his major books and most of the books written for young folks too. I read what others had to say about this book and I wasn't disappointed in it when I bought my own copy. It's a pleasant read and it filled a niche in our research books.Thirty years in reenactment societies..."
1,Really bad....,"This is by far the worst movie in black cinema. Take everything you liked about ""Friday"", ""Booty Call"" and ""CB4"", leave them out of this movie and this is what you get. 90 minutes of [stuff]. It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive ""dancer"".. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep."
4,Palabras de aliento para tu caminar con Dios,"Una vez mas Charles Swindoll llega al corazón del cristiano como tu y como yo. Nos alienta y nos da enseñanza de como enfrentar nuestros Gigantes, reconocer su origen y escudriñar en nuestro corazón para dar con esas espinas que han estado clavadas por mucho tiempo e impide que nuestro caminar con Dios sea firme. Prácticos y profundos principios para ayudarnos a ser mejores en nuestra casa, trabajo y en la iglesia."
5,Spiritual Fitness,An inspiring read which has the potential to change your life providing you actively apply the principles.
4,Mostly a Climbing Book,"Great book if your looking for climbing routes - Class 3 to 5. The book does not offer signifcant insights into hiking routes in the Wind River Range. You can find better hiking intel on the web with Google searches.The Southern and Northern Wind River Maps also work better to plan out hiking trips.With that said, if your looking to rope up and bag a peak, this book is a must."
2,E.A.'s reveiw,"I bought this book for my book club and I have had a very hard time reading it. The characters are too life-like in my opinion for me to have any sympathy towards them. I have read other novels from the Victorian Period that I have liked, but this one seems overly wordy and dull in my opinion. I gave two stars instead of one for the mini novel Indian Summer of a Forsyte, the best part of the series, which saved this from a one star reveiw. It was touching and beautiful to read. If only the rest of the books followed such a formula."
5,enough with the exclamation points already!,"mr. galsworhy may have written a fine solid substantial novel, byt by heaven mr. anthony trollope who lived and wrote over fifty years before was a much more modern writer and didn't qualify every goddam sentence with an exclamation mark. (!) very dated stuff. who knows, maybe one day i'll get past all those damn exclamation marks."
4,Long but interesting,"I got interested in reading this book after viewing the Masterpiece Theater showing of the Forsyte Saga. It was interesting to compare the movie's interpretation of the book, and it gave a little more insight into the motivations of each of the characters. Overall a good book."
4,Who said the rich had it all?,"This is a great soap opera sprawling a number of generations from the 1800's to the changing times of the 1920's & 30's. Through this novel we can see the changes that took place in society where money was no object. There is love, lust, adultery, death, birth and friendship. We find in this novel that those with money during this early times were not suffering with the problems of monetary poverty but that of emotional poverty. There are standards to uphold and mistakes are made and status can suffer.You will love this novel, it is a classic and certainly better than any mini series."
5,High Quality,"One of my favorite gifts I have gotten! These are exquisite and top quality glasses! I remember my Great Grandma had these in the Fire King/Anchor ""Coronation"" that is what attracted me to them. They are so beautiful and would work for any function. I plan on having them for a long time since they are such good quality. You cannot go wrong with this reproduction!!! Especially if you are into Cottage or Shabby Chic home decor. Go for it you wont be dissapointed!"
5,Excellent,Excellent karaoke CD. We love it and the music of Abba just makes us happy! Recommend highly - nice collection of songs.
5,Great cable,I was able to plug this cable into my video camera and download my videos in HD. This allowed me to see my videos in true HD and not just SD.
3,not a review: A QUESTION,"Can you tell me if this firewire/i.LINK cable will connect properly to a digital8 camera, from Sony? I have heard that with a firewire you can connect a digital8 camera with no problem and it will upload automatically, with no software. Since I am seriously considering purchasing a DCR-TRV280 Digital8 Handycam I need to know what I have to get for the best ease of use.This was confusing though because the wire is not included in the purchased material, and it does not indicate which wire should be used although it does say it can be. I hope someone help tell me what's going on because I don't have very much experience in dealing with anything but USB cables."
5,video cable,Easy way to get video from a digital video camera to your computer. You will need a special port on your computer to use this.
4,Great for video transfer!,"Atlast I can transfer my videos from my HC32 Sony camcorder to my laptop! Works with Toshiba & Dell laptops, not sure about others. The iLink/IEEE 1394 port on Toshiba is also called S400."
4,Very good cable,"This cable is really working with my camera, I am transferring digital 8 to DVD and has been working great, the disadvantage is that the speed is not really better that others no brand cables.I recommend this produt"
5,BEST TROMA SO FAR,"I thought troma was dead. i did'nt really like tromeo and juilet and i never saw terror firmer. well, as soon as i thought troma was dead the toxic avenger 4 proved me wrong ( and i am very happy about that!). Any way this movie is awsome it is sooooooo gory and has a lot of funny parts, like the retarted rebel, the ""duck"" scene, and the scene where the original melvin makes an appearence!!!!!! It is also very gory and has a head running over scene that gives the one from the first movie a run for it's money. also the scene where toxie kills all of these nazi cops....i also give loyd kaufman cridet for sticking his neck out and making fun of abortion, raceism and others.TROMA LIVES!!!!"
1,BEYOND OFFENSIVE!,"If you love, care, like, or even have the smallest amount of respect for yourself or another person don't expose them to this garbage! I did not expect a movie with taste, and I enjoy B-movies, tacky gross outs, and off color humor. BUT THIS MOVIE GOES WAY OVERBOARD! The filmakers trying so hard to be shocking they forget to give this flick anything that a decent human being could find enjoyable."
2,One of the lesser Louis L'Amour novels,"I've read them all, many times over and am a big fan. This one held so much promise for me, describing the culture and life of the Californios. And then he had to inject that mystic story of another world in there....."
3,review of the californios,"overall, The Californios was a good historical western story, and one of the best westerns i've ever read. the book was set in the 1800s in southern California and Mexico, and used realstic details and events from that time period to add to the plot. it had the perfect cowboy setting - canyons, deserts, mountains, horses, Indians, and outlaws. it also involved things that were happening in the 1800s, including immigration and dispute between Mexico and the US. throughout the book, the author uses these to relate to his characters and makes the suspense of the story a lot better. The Californios has all the basic western themes too - adventure, gunfights, treasure hunting, bandits, and old wise men. it even involves spirits and mystical events to beef up the mystery."
1,Poor support from Plasplugs,"About four weeks ago, I purchased at a Home Depot in Florida the Plasplugs ""Master Tiler"", model number: DWW180US-BX.I am using it for a porcelain tile installation. The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different ""arbor"" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the ""high glaze"" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the ""all blades except the standard have been discontinued"".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future."
3,Not bad....but don't expect to cut 45,Not bad for a small saw...the 1hp motor cut nicely. The down side to this saw is that the water guard for the blade blocks your view of the cut. I also had to modify the mount for the water guard so that the tile wouldn't catch on the back end. If you want to cut at 45 degrees forgetaboutit....the tool comes with a rip fence but no miter gauge... although it had a miter gauge slot...I had to make my own jig to cut 45 degrees....on the positve side the water tank is pretty self contained and the water guard kept the mess to a minimum...I've rented the bigger saws for larger jobs and ended up cleaning muddy water off the walls. This unit lasted all day with one fill and no spills over the side onto the floor.
4,Master Tiler Wet Saw Review,"For the cost, this tile saw met my expectations. Following the setup instructions for aligning the fence, the saw performed well cutting tile. While it is difficult to freehand beveled cuts using the tilting table, it worked well when I used spring clamps to attach a guide strip to the back side of the tile that followed the edge of the tilting table. The water reservoir provided a good source of water to the blade, but I found that I had to replenish the supply of water on a regular basis. I bought this saw to be able to diagonally cut 19"" tiles that would not fit in my sliding table tile saw. The quality of this saw is definately much higher than less costly plastic versions. Having used this tool, I would buy it again if I needed a tile saw."
1,Not very good,"I cannot recommend this tool. When I first used it, I couldn't cut the tile. I then noticed the blade was spinning backwards! When I turned the saw off, and then on again, the blade didn't spin at all. Finally, I realized that I had to ""spin"" the blade manually as I switched on the saw to get it to turn correctly. Not what I expected from a $[$$$] tool. Once I finally got it working, I was still disappointed with the performance. Cutting was very slow, and not very accurate. ..."
2,Spend your money elsewhere...,"You could do a lot better for the price of this tool. Comparing it to comprable models costing half as much? I recommend spending for the cheaper models or springing for something better. The blade wouldn't align with the blade guard until I modified the table with a file. The tightening bolt that runs through the fence stripped in less than two weeks of light use. (Trust me, I'm not THAT strong.) Spend less or spend more, just don't bother to spend for this tool. One additional note: I contacted the manufacturer about the stripped rip fence and they promptly sent me a replacement without questions. I suppose that's worth an upgrade to 2 1/2 stars. I still think one could do better for the money. Oh, and my saw leaks water continuously when the unit is operating. Better leave it at two stars afterall."
5,Great Value,"Used this saw to cut 3/8 inch granit tile and it worked better than i anticipated. Had no leaks as others indicated..some mess, yes, but not unusual with tile cutting. The diamond blade lasted throughout the kitchen project but did show signs of wear towards the end. . Certainly a great value!!!"
3,Good for Homeowners,"Let me start off by saying that this saw has payed for itself many times over for me. I did two bathrooms (walls and floor), hallway, 2 backsplashes, and laundry room floor with this tile.The motor is definitely powerful enough for the job. I cut stone, ceramic, and porcelain with this saw without any problems.The construction is a bit flimsy. The table tilting mechanism is worthless. The worst thing about this saw is the 7/8"" arbor. The only aftermarket blades with a 7/8"" arbor hole are masonry blades that can't be used for tile. You're stuck buying blades from Plasplugs and they don't make a high-glaze blade for delicate glazed tile so you end up chipping the glaze around the cut line.If you're a pro, get a good professional saw - if you need to do a several rooms in your house, this saw is adequate."
1,Very poor,"This is a very good concept, but poorly executed. On my particular saw, the tilt section of the table didn't fit flush, so it made the right side of the table useless. Once raised to the 45 degree position, the tilt section was wobbly, as one of the flimsy plastic props did not even touch its rest. The blade ran neither true nor parallel to the fence. The blade retaining nut had to be tightened about every 10 cuts. The blade actually flew off the shaft a couple of times. The tile caught on the plastic end caps of the fence, which stick out. I could easily stall the motor with ordinary 1/4 inch ceramic tile. Can't remember all the other thigs wrong with it, I was in too much of a hurry to return it."
1,Buy Something Else!,"The first tile I cut... I knew I had purchased the wrong saw. Maybe to use the rip fence it would work ok, but to cut tile freehand, it was useless. The blade comes up through the table, like a table saw, with the blade spinning through 1 inch of water in the bottom of the tank. The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched. Bad design. I'm returning it and spending the extra money to get something good."
1,PlasPlug Master Tile Cutter,"Bought at Home Depot for $199. It is a toy, not suitable for serious work. Flimsy contruction, difficult or impossible to adjust. Recommend getting a brand name."
1,spend the additional money and get an MK,"My main complaint is the fence, getting both sides square to the blade and locked down will take you about five minute's and even then don't put to much pressure on the fence as it will ether bow or one side will move. An MK is much faster put the tile on the carriage push the tile to the blade make sure the kurf is going to be on the correct side of your mark slide the carriage back set the fence (if you'd like) turn the saw on and cut. I renovate older home and many times the walls are out of square so your cut tiles are going to be getting bigger or smaller as you go God help you if you get into this position with the Plasplugs tile saw...."
2,"Bad fence, Bad tilt","The rail keeps popping up, so the plastic endcaps are no longer flush with the table. I had to file them down so the tile won't get caught. The tilting table will move apart at the hinge when I start pushing the tile through the blade, it is just useless. Straight cuts seemed to work OK. This may be suitable for small around the house jobs. I think the design is from England. Bad British engineering !!"
4,Seems to Work,"So far I have no complaints. It seems to be working, but I think in more time, I will know if I absolutely love it. I have low progesterone and suffer from PMDD. My last cycle, my pms symptoms were less pronounced, so I think it is working."
1,made my head spin,this made me really dizzy so I had to stop using it after only one use. I ended up tossing it out.
4,It really does help,"I have been taking this supplement for a while. I only take one a day. I tried not taking it for a week just to minimize the pills I take every day, but I could feel my mood worsen. This is a great product."
1,Didn't help,"I found research that said this possibly may help get your cycles back and so after finishing the bottle the cycle never came. I guess if you keep it up after a few months is what might help, but I decided instead of buying more and hoping it would help to talk to my doctor first."
2,Caused tiredness and confusion,"I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex, but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary. After the first week, I only noticed the tiredness increasing. I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange. When taking it during the day, one time, I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to. I'd go through these spells where I felt very heady, like I was going to pass out. I was only taking 250mg per day. I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS, but I couldn't continue with it. This doesn't seem like a common result, but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex's side effects. Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract, but this is something I'm not messing around with any more! Back to progesterone cream!"
4,Jay Hoggard,"Jay Hoggard is a vibes player who shows a strong affinity for both Milt Jackson and Bobby Hutcherson. His use of the pedal gives him a very warm, dream-like sound - his unaccompanied version of MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE is a good example of that. But he can swing hard, too, as on STARTING OVER, a Bobby Hutcherson tune that also features drummer Yoron Israel. SWEET POTATO is right out of the church, and the group plays a very relaxed STOMPIN' AT THE SAVOY. Guitarist Kenny Burrell plays well on Monk's EPISTROPHY. The only misstep for me is the title track, which is much ""freer"" than the others and has a strong Ornette Coleman flavor to it. Other than that, it's an excellent CD."
5,GREAT for my rosacea,"I have bought this and also the extra strength. I bought the regular then realize it came in extra strength. I alternate using them and they seem to work the same. This product has taken away 95% of my redness and flaking due to my rosacea. I have really tried everything and nothing worked in the past. Even my skin Dr suggested things and nothing worked. I saw this on a show on NBC and thought I would give it a try and so glad I did. I use it everyday. I am unsure why the price is so much lower on Amazon vs buying it directly from the Dr Gross website, seems odd to me."
3,Not impressed,"For the amount of time invested and money spent, this product did not live up to expectations. I will not re-order. I noticed very little change in my skin even tho I used it faithfully and according to directions."
3,Nothing Dramatic,"This product was okay. But, I didn't find a big difference when I added it to my skin care procedures. Secondly, the little pads are too thin - kind of low budget for a $68 product"
1,Expensive experiment that didn't work,"I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done."
5,excellent product,"This skincare product has saved my 50+ year old complexion. It's like having a facial every day. Great for anybody, any skintype, even teenagers. Worth the money. Leaves the skin w/ a ""just right"" texture: not dry, not greasy. You can apply make-up right after using the pads."
3,Seeing slow results,"I used to buy DDF's 30 Days to Radiance, it's a similar concept with 30 pads and 2 different applications. Somehow they discontinued it, so when I went to the Nordstrom makeup counter they recommended trying the MD skincare line. Maybe this particular product works a little slower than DDF and I have to be patient to see great results. But so far in using for a week it's been so-so, I wish DDF would bring back they're product it's amazing. Not sure if this was worth spending $125 for."
1,"Horrible product, wish I could give it negative stars....","This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further. If you want to breakout horribly even if you don't normally and to have an awful rash on your face for days, this is the product for you. If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare."
3,Okay but expected more,"I have been using this product for about three months now. At first, it really seemed to be making my skin tone more clear and radiant. But my main problem is oily skin and adult acne (which is worse at 37 than it was at 17). And MD hasn't helped that at all. My skin is still an oil slick, and I still get frequent breakouts. Dealing with my breakouts has started to really tick me off now that I am spending around $100 a month on the MD skincare system, versus the $10.00 or so I used to spend on Neutrogena or the like. But to give MD credit, I have cruddy skin - large pores, oily all over, etc. I like the clean feeling the pads give me but it just doesn't seem worth the cost anymore. So I am moving on. Going to try Nucelle."
5,SO Expensive BUT...,Great product! I have used many a skin care product and this was by far the best one. But because its so expensive i have to buy it sparingly. (Im not a high roller) I have ordered this product twice in the last year and it works right away. The problem is you really have to use them all in 30 days or the pads will dry up on you. This is dissapointing since i really dont need to use them everyday. Nonetheless this product works...if i had the money i would keep a ready supply in my cabinet.
4,Vision of Blindness,"Here Derrida offers a vision of blindness, that is to say a ""vision"" of ""blindness"", or even a ""vis""ion of ""blind""ness. By deconstructing the very ""act"" of see""ing"", he defers to différance, grammatology, and ""éperons"", that is to say, the ""spurs"" by which we harry, that is to say hurry, the horse(s) of structuralized condescension. Perception, that is, or ""interception"", or even ""interperception"" of vision--or more precisely, visuality, and all that implies. Reading, and re-reading, this book, we can easily understand why Derrida and his thought were so instrumental in the fall of apartheid."
4,published letters - free for Kindle,"Even well written letters won't contain the whole story. Still I enjoyed the descriptions of life on a frontier. The storms, the relationships, and the culture left me wanting more; but friends can't share everything in letters. That is part of the time period. Intimate feeling but no ""twitter"" details. This free book was worth more than I paid for it."
3,WHEN YOU BELIEVE CD REVIEW,NOW THIS WAS ONE OF MARIAH'S LEAST SUCCESSFUL SONG- THE OTHER ONE BEING CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY- BUT IT'S STILL WORTH BUYING IF YOU'RE A COLLECTOR.
5,They fit Perfect....,I think that they are both nice voiced and this Cd is a great combination. A relaxive song with nice music. The only bad thing is that there is only 1 song including in this Cd. Anyway this is great Cd to buy...
3,"It is a piece which i dont really like,but the artist are ok","Really i don't love the piece the first time i listened to it,but each time i see the two of them on stage i will be forced to like the the music, so keep on moving."
3,I Feel Bad For Mariah,"I feel bad for Mariah, she stands no chance going against the BEST DIVA EVER, Whitney Houston.Whitney is beautiful, ridiculously talented, and has the PERFECT VOICE.Mariah is ugly (check out that huge forehead)! and is the most overrated singer in the world.This is an excellent song but Mariah completely ruins it."
2,Movie Version is Much better!,"The movie version of this song is much better. The Mariah/Whitney version is simply just a screaming contest to see who can sing better. I admit the song is beautiful and touching, but it would have been better if one of them sung it instead of it being a competition. Buy the soundtrack and listen to the movie version. It showcases the song in a much better light."
2,New Age?,"The song is sung beautifully, but is it promoting New Age? Should we believe in ourselves or in God? I think the focus should be more on believing in God and not just in ourselves."
5,"""When you believe""","This song, sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey is GREAT! Sometimes, it leaves tears in my eyes. But, the song has some contrasts. Whitney Houston has one of the most beautiful voices in the universe. So when she sings the first verse and chorus, and then Mariah Carey starts to sing the second verse... it's a HUGE CONTRAST! Mariah screeches... If Celine Dion, who has the most wonderfully beautiful voice in the universe, had sung it with Whitney Houston, the song would've been irresistible. It would have been so unexplainable beautiful. Anyway, great job, Mariah and Whitney!"
4,last minute order,I ordered this at the last minute and it arrived on time. The case was cracked but the Cd was undamaged.
4,Informative,"Read it all of it. can not say that I will use any of it. As a woodsman we usually go out already prepared and with our own more modern and durable gear. maybe if I were to live out there and have to replace my goods as they will inevitable need replacing with the suggestions in this book, but seeing as I am a working class man and will not live n the woods it just is good reading and that is all."
5,great book,this is a great book. it was written well and read more like a story and not a manual the information although somewhat dated was great to read about and made me think about how a woodsman would have lived in the early 1900s
3,Strange....,"This is a very strange book. There are a lot of small messages that Mr. Malamud delivers in each of his stories. Everything from the mistreatment of others to stealing. He covers many different aspects of life that can help make people better citizens of the world.I did not enjoy his style of writing though. It was dull, and very dry. There was no excitment in any of his stories and I found it hard to keep myself reading. I can see how somebody else might enjoy it though... if you're the type that likes dull, dry stories, Malamud is the guy for you."
2,BORING!,"I would suggest before sitting down to read this book that you brew a large pot of coffee. Or better yet, don't sit down to read it at all. This is dry stuff!"
5,Magic Malamud,"Malamud does three or four tricks in his fiction well, and here he does each one to utter perfection. And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."
4,Interesting,"This book was interesting. I feel not everyone gets these short stories. The stories are sad and depressing, but that's the author's point: immigrant life can really suck. There isn't always a happy ending. Also, I read this book on my ipad so there were a lot of issues with formatting, which was annoying."
4,The best pocket jujitsu book,"Small-Circle Jujitsu is the best pocket jj book on the market and also the closest book to traditional, real, ju jutsu. The photos are good (black and white), but the quality of paper can be better (maybe in next edition). All you need for to begin train is in this book."
3,Great book on Jujutsu,This book is more useful as training reference for a Small-Circle Jujitsu practioner as while the principle of the small circle is quite interesting and so is Wally Jay's history the book really doesn't cover many principals of grappling in depth.The best books to get to understand the grappling arts isThe Canon of Judo: Classic Teachings on Principles and TechniquesandTotal Aikido: The Master Course (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)as these books go into the details and strategy of grappling arts where as this book is more for advanced practioners.
4,Good if you already know some Jiu-Jitsu,"As a Marine Corps Close Combat Instrtuctor, I can tell you that the majority of these techniques work well, and may be learned and applied by anyone. I do, however, beleive that much practical application and sparring/grappling against many different opponents is necessary to become proficient in any fighting art. Nearly ALL of the Marine Corps Close Combat techniques are found in this book. As our system was a collaboration of many SME's (subject matter experts), that has to speak for something. In addition, Wally echos one of my main points to my students, do not ever become subbornly commited to one technique. You must be able to flow from one to another based partly upon your skill, but primarily the actions of your opponent. Great book, although the pictures and descriptions could be better for beginning practitioners. If you are familiar with basic Jiu-jitsu techniques and principles, you should have no problems."
3,Small-Circle Jujitsu is just OK,"I became interested in learning about Jujitsu when I watched Royce Gracie for the first time in the Ultimate Fighting Championships. My interest was sparked even more when I saw Rickson Gracie's video ""Choke"". DO NOT buy this book if you expect to learn the techniques that the Gracies use, because this is a very different style. The book does not deal with any kind of ground fighting...it is strictly stand up combat with a few throws. A lot of the moves would be very difficult to perfect without a partner to practice on, so be sure that you have someone that you can train with."
3,Small Circle or Kodenkan Yawara ?,"I did not find what I was looking for here. I was hoping to find an entire book on ""Small Circle JuJitsu"" and instead found a book that was 80-90% standard Kodenkan JuJitsu at maybe the Shodan Level and only 10-20% of what I would consider ""Small Circle JuJitsu"". I was 20% satisfied and left feeling empty. Maybe I just lack the experience to understand what his two books convey? But I don't think so!"
2,Alot of decent pictures and instructions,As a student of jiujitsu i understood alot of the moves but i found that without previous knowledge these pictures and instructions were difficult to understand. I feel there is alot of good information but not worth buying.
2,Buy a different jujitsu book,I bought it before I knew anything. Now that I have been training a bit more and reading more I realized that this book is lacking a whole lot. I do not really recomend this book unless you can get it for free.
1,Total rip off!,I ordered this and realized I didn't specify the size so went back 20 min. later to cancel the order and then order another one.the shipping is 3/4 the priced of the item! Then after what I thought was a canceled order didn't even work at all. I have been sending emails all day and tried to call them to no avail. Horrible communication. they took my money and haven't even responded to my email or phone call.Caveat Emptor
5,The first excellent book ever written about Heinlein,"Finally, somebody has written a truly useful book about that most important of American science fiction authors, Robert A. Heinlein. In the past, sloppy criticism and the grinding of personal axes have ruined every single attempt to produce a book discussing Heinlein's works (I have the misfortune of having read them all). Gifford has produced what has to be the groundwork for all future studies of Heinlein: a basic categorization and numbering of every single published and unpublished work in the canon, along with the insiders' story on each entry. Readable from cover to cover, or as a reference work, Gifford has also performed the one invaluable goal of every reader's companion: he's sent me back to rereading the original works, but with fresh perspectives and insights. A perfect score, after twenty years of utter failures in Heinlein scholarship. Bravo!"
5,"An intelligent, broad-ranging book","James Gifford has given us a book immense in its scope, detailing the works of one of Science Fiction's Grand Master, and one of the genre's most prolific authors.The format is very reader-friendly. The individual entries for each work are fascinating for any Heinlein lover, and the bibliography and opus list will prove invaluable to new readers who wish to delve into Heinlein's universe. Truly a landmark achievement in research and clarity."
3,"Heavy on process, light on content...","Somewhat disappointing for the Heinlein fan interested in detailed summaries and analysis. More useful for those looking for chronologies, timelines, cross-referencing, etc. Still, this flawed Heinlein reader's companion is better than nothing."
4,Good for latin american enthusists- and that's it,"It has been a while since I read this book (maybe two months), but I just wanted to add to the body of reviews that if you love Latin American fiction or books that might read like the old Masterpiece Theater productions, you'll probably enjoy reading this book, and otherwise you'll probably be bored to tears. The writing is not very sophisticated, as is covered by others. Actually, given the quality of the book, I'm surprised by the number of reviewers! Many better books even in latin american fiction like Belli's The Invisible Woman have far less coverage. However, if you are thinking of buying the book to be well read in this genre(or if you want something specifically on El Salvador), you won't do wrong."
3,disappointing,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book since it came so highly recommended by a trusted book catalogue. On the positive side, the book gives an interesting account of the historical struggle between the rich coffee plantation owners and the uprising of the poor Indian workers. However, the author fails, in my opinion, in developing her characters beyond the superficial, and thus I remained uninvolved for the most part and detached from all the human tragedies. In summary, Ms Benitez had a wonderful premise for a story, and the history and description of El Salvador are enlightening and in part very beautiful, but the plot and characters ultimately remain shallow and mimick the sub-plot soap opera."
2,disappointing,"This is our book group selection this month and I was looking forward to a good read, especially judging by the appealing cover. Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to. Jacinta in particular needed some enchancement. It will be interesting too hear what my fellow book club members think."
1,Unbelievable!,"I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it. What a mess!"
4,An end with a bang,"This is the first book I have read by Sandra Benitez. I have done much research on the the 1932 matanza in El Salvador and some on the civil war. I am Salvadoran and began reading the book critically and from a historical point of view. It began quite slow for me and somewhat sided, but as I read on I began to feel as I knew the characters and their realities. This is an excellent book. The realities of life, love, family, death, and war are presented strongly and passionately. The ending is gripping and seems unlikely, but definately portrays the difficult times of the civil war. Read it, it will provide a fictional story of the lives of some in a war torn country."
2,Abandoned this one,"This is about the trials and tribulations of a multigenerational family.We found it disengaging and rather tedious. It went on and on without getting far at the beginning and we started skipping scenes to see if it picked up. In the end we abandoned it.I'd hoped for more from a movie with Saif Ali Khan, Salman Khan & Karisma Kapoor but this was 1999 and I guess it wasn't among their better stuff. The music and dance was ho-hum and unmemorable too.Elsewhere on the Net it scores average. However it was below average for us and not a keeper."
5,great goggles,"These are the best goggles we have ever tried. They fit well, do not fog up and have a good seal. No rashes from the material. The instructions for replacing the clear lenses with optic lenses are rubbish but once you pop the plastic frame off, the rest is very easy. Ignore the packet instructions and just follow your instincts!"
4,Sounds Like Santa,The bells are exactly what you think they are and sound exactly like you think they do. My daughter was THRILLED to be able to make her own Santa sounds. They seem pretty durable and are great for the price.
1,Weak out-dated plans,"I got this book expecting a bunch of puzzles from the cover and title. There are many other items to be found, but everything looks very out-dated. Definitely keep looking if you want puzzles or other up-to-date patterns.Wayne"
2,"Great translation, Poor packaging","I love the ESV translation and rate it five stars. I am upset that the publisher of this translation so poorly packages its product. This edition is a ""shirt pocket"" edition that seems well bound but has impossibly small print.What is needed is a ""coat pocket"" size edition of the New Testament that is bound in such a way that it will lie open of its own accord. The print size should be 10 or higher. This present edition will not lie open, and, what the more, the print is so small that only an ant could read it.Crossway publishes only two editions of the New Testament alone, and both are inferior. The print is too small to be read with enjoyment. Something has to change!"
2,Small type,"My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose."
1,True stem-winder of a novel,"Really, really awful. The sheer paucity of Alan Dean Foster's imagination is staggering. ""Midworld"" was recommended to me by a friend; at first I thought I was the victim of a bad joke. Could be used as a blueprint on how not to write a novel. Witless, humorless, and lacking in even the slightest glimmer of originality. Don't waste your time."
5,Wonderfrul Creatures,"No one describes a creature like Alan Dean Foster! Hands down, the very best. His silverslith sent shivers down my arms. I've read it many times, and I even use it to teach my students how to write a descriptive paragraph. His mind knows no bounds when inventing animals, plants, and humans. Probably my favorite fantasy book of all times (though Mid-Flinx) comes in a close second."
5,You'll read this one again and again.,"This book, like Heinlein's Starship Troopers, is a book I keep reading again and again over the years, and for similar reasons. As previous reviewers have stated, this book is quite compact, yet rich and complete, and operates on several levels. It's the description of a fascinating world. It's an adventure story. It's a character study. It's a parable. The concept is intriguing, and the characters are multi-faceted. It's a compact classic, and until today I hadn't realized that Midworld had shown up in any other books. Those books (all of them) are going on my Amazon Wish List today.Read this book, and read Starship Troopers. Both are SO much more than bugs-in-space. They're worth far more time than they actually take to read."
5,Wonderful world,"I first read this book as a teenager, many, many years ago, and I still dig it out of my bookshelf every other year to re-immerse myself in Foster's wildly imaginative world. He has such a great talent for inventing intriguing flora and fauna!Only two little flaws come to mind:1. Midworld seems a little too lethal for any colony to survive long enough to discover the Home Trees and make use of them.2. In Mid-Flinx, the author describes fire-extinguishing flora. They apparently don't exist in Midworld because if they did, the corporation couldn't have built their R&D; complex."
4,Prose for thought,"Beautifully written in prose form, Baldwin writes of race relations, and the awakening of one's mind to the differences, perceived or otherwise, of race, color, and their political ramifications. Very candid, and yet ultimately subtle, too---the book, which is written in the form of a letter, makes one think about the trials that many minorities (primarily African-Americans) go/went through and how far we've come today......and, yet sadly, how much further we have to go. This short book makes you think---with your eyes wide open."
3,Love Stories,"I enjoyed reading tales of others who were being romantic. Although I was a bit disappointed by the lack of creativity or originality in most of the vignettes. If you are wanting help being romantic, skip this book. If you are looking for a feel good experience, reading about other happy couples, you might enjoy it."
5,Treat yourself & buy it!,"I'd have to agree with M-Speedy, this album is great! If you enjoy Cyndi Boste this second album won't disappoint."
4,A new target of cutting wit?,"Jokes can be both funny and cutting, and often it seems that women have been the victims of comedy more often than men. But jokes aside, this book of quotations demonstrates that even if the numbers are not equal, men too have been the target of commentary but amusing and attacking for centuries. The illustrations are simple black & white drawings of a ""Victorian"" style, rather satirically in itself considering the gender roles at that time. The book is organized on the premise that males are a extincted species and this is a pseudo-historical view of them by the survivors, females. The book has five chapters where the quotations are organized by subject and tone. I found it actually quite interesting but not necessarily funny, but them I'm a historian and a feminist so I was over-analyzing the content, I'm sure. I find it to be a good source for bitting commentary when I write some of my fiction."
3,Very cursory overview of being a yearbook adviser- many years ago,"This book shows it's age, as it is published before computers were involved in the yearbook process. It does contain several good tips and hints, and would be a good option as an introduction for a new adviser, but does not contain much new information even for an individual who already has a year under his belt."
5,My issue isn't with the work of fiction,"I love the story of Tess. Considering many of the classics I have ever read, I think Tess is one of the easier ones to understand. The work itself is a masterful story. However, I take issue with Penguin's version. The Notes are just awful- referencing back and forth from your place in the book to the back is a nightmare and many times isn't worth breaking your flow. Some of the Notes are helpful and even necessary to understand the sentence, but others are pointless and annoying. I recommend a different version, either without notes entirely or with more reasonable ones."
4,Hardy's Classic Worth the Read,"This novel, contrary to some of the other comments, is a wonderful piece of literature. Although not the most uplifting, it is a great example of Hardy and Deterministic and Naturalistic fiction. Despite Tess' best efforts (like Jude in the other Hardy novel), she is unable to escape the poverty and misfourtune which she attempts to leave behind. Although somewhat lengthy, the novel is one of the better pieces of British fiction to come out of the period."
5,Just so tragic!,"I can't believe how tragic this book is! I picked up this book with an unexpected decision. The book I was supposed to read was Queen of the Damned, but then I saw this book and the cover appealed to me. So I decided I'll read it. At first it was kinda boring, until the last 1/3 of the book, I was so depressed by it...how fate was toying with them, and how their characteristic had decided their fate............Anywayz, this is truly a wonderful book, either by plot, writing, background, history, religion, describtion, etc etc, it's all with perfection. Read it, even though the beginning part might be kinda boring, it's for you to understand it better.I'd recommend this book to anybody, and if you like tragedies, you definitely *have* to read it!!"
4,An extremely interesting read.,"Ok, the first time I too this book out of the library, I got halfway through it before I hurled it at the wall. I couldn't stand the characters and I was so mad and frustrated with them I returned it without finishing it. A month later, it was drivng me crazy not knowing how the characters fared, and I took it out and finished it. But this time, I knew how to read it: I didn't try so hard to relate to the characters, I just read their story. And I found if a fascinating study of suffering and sorrow and love and all that good stuff. So just get throught the very frustrating middle and it's good, really. Strange, gothic ending, but good. And check out the A&E movie, because it's excellent - better thatn the book, and that's weird. Perfect casting and adaptation. Ok, that's all."
3,Depressing,This book written in the mid 1800's reads like an opera tragedy. Tess is raped and becomes pregnant and has to deal with the guilt and shame of the living in those times and how it complicates all of her romantic relationships. As modern woman I found the whole story utterly depressing.
1,Can I shoot myself now??,"A few years back I was forced to read ""Tess"" for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on ""Tess.."""
1,"The book was boring, because of its victorian ideals.","Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."
4,"Glad I read it, but","This year I decided to reread some classics, and read some I never had read. This one was a little tough for me. I'd be reading and have to backtrack few pages for the first time ever."
3,thought i'd try,i'm not in love with this book. as classic i thought it'd be better but it drags and drags and drags and there's not much to keep your attention. its very vaguely written and i can tell already i'm not a fan of Thomas Hardy
4,"""Tess"" is a wonderful story of innocents and disapiontment.","""Tess of the d'Ubervilles"" is the story of a young and innocent woman who wants nothing more than to live a happy life. Every time Tess comes close to happiness something goes wrong. By the end of the book the emotional stress of Tess's life is clear, leaving the reader sympathetic to her misfotune."
5,"Deliberately frustrating, occasionally profound, great read.","About fifteen years ago, this book was almost universally considered Hardy's great masterpiece. However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign. Hardy's gift for creating sympathetic characters seems infinite in magnitude. His prose is unique and at times more harrowing in tone than Conrad's. This book would be a great introduction to the work of one of the great masters of English Literature."
3,Ok book,"This book was a good book at times and a somewhat boring book at times. I was assigned this book to read for english class. In my class there were those who liked it and those who didn't. I on the other hand thought it to be just Ok. Tess had her moments when you wanted to cheer her on but most of the time was spent looking back to try and understnad what happened, and many times the book was such that it put you to sleep ( which happened to me on 7 occasions ). In all it is not a bad book, but I would not recommend it to younger readers, and if any english teachers are reading this please think about what your students would like to read not yourself and what you think is good."
2,Sorely disappointed,"The back cover of my book described Tess as a heroine for her time. I was thrilled to begin reading this book to discover what it was that made her a heroine. I was very disappointed by the end of the book. She was no heroine, more like a self-pitying brat! Hardy did a fantastic job of describing life during that periold of time, but that talent was not enough to change my opinion of the book. Very aggrevating!!!"
2,Zzzzzzzzzz.....,"TESS is one of the more boring works of literature. Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck."
3,Maybe it's just not my style...,"It seemed to me that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a bit dull at times, but the storyline as a whole was quite interesting. There is a great deal of imagery, so much that I deemed it to be in the way of my actually getting absorbed in the novel. Surprises abound, but they are surrounded by lengthy passages describing everything and anything. Nature, being an important aspect of the novel, receives so much attention, and Hardy expounds upon it so meticulously, that it becomes an effort to read through everything. I was disappointed in the very beginning by this style of narration (actually, thinking of Hardy's other novels, it is very much like him), but by the end, I found it to be absorbing. The character of Tess is very memorable, and awe-inspiring. I recommend this if you have plenty of time to devote to a novel (not looking for a quick read), and if you like Hardy's style; if you do, you'll find this to be a very good read."
3,XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI do not want to rate this at this time. I would like the option to comment if I feel strongly about it one way or the other.
2,Exhausting,"This book has it's place--and that place is in an American Literature course at a university. It was entirely too technical to be enjoyable. I was assigned this book as a ninth grader and now that I am a teacher and understand lexile levels, I must advise other teachers not to assign this book until the later grades--and only to the highest students."
4,It's OK,"It was really a great book, but what is Tess's problem?!?She is just too trusting and dependant. And Angel. He's seriously got issues. I mean, come on! He liked Tess just because she was perfect!! DON'T GET ME WRONG, THE BOOK REALLY WAS GREAT!!"
2,Bit of a Letdown in the End,"This is part of my attempt to read classics and non-fiction as well as my usual speculative fiction this year. A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville."
2,Not a brilliant book but...,I didn't like this book very much. It was silly. I'm sorry that I've wasted time reading this book. There are better books to read.
3,Simple,"This book was not anything special. Although I love romances, it was too simple. The symbolism was spelled out to the readers in a blunt manner. The less educated readers may appreciate it. The wording was quite beautiful at times and the plot was enchanting (perfect for a movie) but it is not heart wrenching like the movie Titantic (which was a must see!) ;)"
2,Glad to be of this century,I didn't like the book. The language was difficult to read and in the end the topic was one i don't agree with. The ultra right values where women were always at fault for tempting a man and she was the one dealt final cruel punishment. I am relieved to be of this century. Makes us appreciate what we have and what those before us had to suffer for us to be where we are now.
4,how tess' motherhood experience change her life...,"Tess, a naive and young girl whose one night relationship with her cousin Alec ruins her life, is a great example of a woman in love who would do anything for her husband and nothing for herself. Tess is a great book to read. I NEED HELP AND SOON IN LESS THAN A WEEK I HAVE A TERM PAPER ON TESS DUE (THE CONSEQUENCES OF MOTHERHOOD BEFORE BEING WED IN ENGLAND IN THE 1800'S AS SEEN IN TESS) PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ANY MATERIAL THAT CAN HELP ME EMAIL IT TO ME. tHANKS IN ADVANCED!!!!!"
4,Good Companion Piece,I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.
3,"I may seem like a bubble butt for this, but...","...when you're forced to read something this boring, it doesn't tend to sit well. The simple plot followed by confusing images, muffled transition, and the fact my Senior English teacher thought this was a very good book, well... I wasn't too happy with it. What did appeal to me was the imagery and the character of Tess, who was presented very nicely. (Hence the extra stars <wink>) Sorry if offended anyone.BTC"
2,This book has a dire need to be shortened,This book in the beginning was so slow that I finished a book twice it's length before I finished the first chapter of Tess of the D'Urdubervilles.
1,Disappointing,I was really disappointed in this book and surprised that so many people think it is a wonderful story. It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier).
5,Time Well Spent,"For those beginning to read the classics this one is a great hook. While the characters are complex the story is linear and the allusions are simple enough to follow. One can't help but hope Tess's life will somehow turn out right although knowing it will not. The burdens she encounters seem to do little to stop her from moving forward. Life seems so unfair to her, but Hardy handles her masterfully; indeed it is safe to say Hardy loves her more than God does."
3,Sad classic novel,"This is a classic novel that is one of the saddest. It involves a very likeable, innocent country girl who is seduced by a cruel employer. She has a child by that union that dies early in infancy. She later meets a man who loves her but upon learning her past rejects her. She then meets up again with the first man, who forces her to be his mistress. The ending is very sad.Through it all Tess maintains her dignity and is a very likeable character. This novel shows the extreme cruelty of legalistic morality that is not tempered by compassion and respect for others, particularly women during this time period.The book is very well written if you like poetic descriptions and vivid imagery. Hardy is a master of both, and of the human drama."
5,A classic frustration...,"Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result. While not a ground breaking novel, it's eloquence and true to life appeal allows it to become part of you. I can only highly recommed this book and will read it again and again..."
4,Best book forced to read......,Out of all the book I was forced to read...I LOVED this one... the movie was good but the book was great...it is the only book I still have from my early Michigan college years.
1,Buyer Beware,This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore.
1,The worst book I have read,I don't know how can this book be a classic. I haven't thought that I could find such absurd stuff in a book. Don't waste your time with it.
1,WHY???????????????????????????????????????????????????,"WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text? It is enough to put anyone off English Lit for LIFE. If anyone in authority is reading this, PLEASE take this piece of junk OFF the sylabus...PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,couldn't give it more stars,I haven't been able to get into it ...read only a bit and it hasn't held my attention...maybe I'll try again sometime... I know it is supposed to be like a classic so try it ....
2,"""Poor Tess""",Thia is the saddest story I have ever read! Poor girl---she doesn't have a chance with finding a happy life! The cards are all stacked against her from the git-go!
2,Couldnt get to the story,"I thought the story line sounded interesting so i bought it...twice! Trying to get a version of the book that wasnt so diffucult to read, its ok off and on, half the time i dont know what the author is referring to cause it was written so long ago that the author uses that language and it just got in my way of the story, which is why i bought it again thinking the 2nd book looked easier to read but it wasnt...sadly i will be reduced to trying to find the movie to find out what happens and it bothers me because i hate to not finish a book!"
4,looking back,I have read several Thomas Hardy novels starting with The Mayor of Casterbridge many years ago in high school and I never really appreciated the style and the fact that like other Hardy novels Tess is a love story and a very good story. Worth reading
3,Typical Victorian: quite skimmable,"If you must choose between ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles"" and ""Far from the Madding Crowd,"" choose the latter. ""Tess"" is a well-written novel, and has quite a few exellent scenes--the most striking of which I consider to be the field scene where Tess incessantly labours (no rhyme intended!), only to pause devotedly to nurse her illegitimate son. Tess herself is a dynamic character; but the novel as a whole becomes dreary and calls for skimming."
3,It's a classic but hard to read,I enjoyed the story but it was very hard to read and follow at times. The British tone is very strong and takes awhile to get used to.
4,can't wait to finish reading it,Good book still reading it still trying to understand all the different wording of the book but it's pretty good I want you to review everything hopefully
3,Suffering needlessly,Difficult read but captivatingSimpleton pure high ideal. Poverty makes mockery of high moral in all. Live as it were unfair to women
4,Good book,This is a good book. It is sad that many of Tess bad decisions caused her life to be worst off than it should have been. Instead of making lemonade from her lemons in life life she continued to suck on the sour sour fruit over and over again.
3,sad story,"I am finding Thomas Hardy a great writer that I dislike. I plan on reading everything he wrote because his stories are very interesting and complex. However, I do not like most of his endings as the tend to involed the deaths of major characters in his works. In this story Tess has a very hard and sad life, that ends with her being hang for murder. All through the story I kept hoping that at some point she would find happiness or at least peace with herself. instead her situation kept getting more and more complacted and depressing. No matter what she did fate was out to deny her any hope of a nice fulfilling life. Finally she accepts death and escapes her suffering. Gloomy book but well worth reading."
5,"A classic that isn't boring or dull, actually fun to read!!!","This was a very chilling and creepy book to read, I highly enjoyed it and recommended it. It came as such a great surprise that this book, written decades ago, is comparabely as scary as Stephen King novels, but more wicked (and rather a bit more difficult of a task to read).Through circumstances and the evil of others, the young just prior nymph Tess Durverfield, suffers a series of tragedies. A victim of innocence, youth, beauty, and love. THIS WAS GREAT!"
5,Mechanical Female,"Tess is a very difficult book and I would not recommend it to the average old contemporary reader. There is so much more meaning behind the birth of the rapist's child, and the break-up of Tess and her ""husband"" Angel. You have to read the fine-lines and ""footnotes"". In other words, there is absolutely no way you could relate to this book, and anyways...why would you want to relate to books? The experiences Tess goes throught at such an early age has scarred her for life. Well, she doesn't live much of a life now that you think about it."
5,MOST WORTHY CLASSIC NOVEL,"As the synoposis says: Violated by one man, forsaken by another, Tess Durbeyfield is a magnificent and spirited heroine of Thomas Hardy's immortal work.Written in a no-nonsense yet frilly female tone, Tess of the Durbervilles is just as comarible to ADAM BEDE, both are beloved and my most honored classics every. I enthusiastically recommend the two, these are the books that deserve to be called CLASSICS."
5,Alec or Angel? False Morality Exposed through one Woman's Innocence,"""I became acquainted with Thomas Hardy through another of his classic works, which lent to my curiosity on this one when the audio version was made available to me. It was an experience, to the say the least, hearing how the innocent life of this girl of late 19th century England played out. For no reason other than her own naiveté is she rendered with injustice and prejudicial attitudes of the day - Hardy's denouncement of his own country's false morals. In my view, all males of our current day and age should find this impressive work required reading, and then determine whether they are an Alec D'urberville or an Angel Clare. It seems we all fall into one category or the other."""
4,Great classic,"Great read, had very few mistakes. The tragedy and triumph in this story has always attracted me, in a way that few stories have been able to do.It will always be on my favorite read list. Tess is the epitome of being a woman born in a time when circumstances really called for strength and courage. Now on my kindle fire and will go with me everywhere."
5,Excellent,I put this book on my ipod and then thought I'd like to be able to read it when I couldn't listen. I have a kindle and kindle fire. It went to both Kindles! Yea! Now I have the book all places so how ever I want to read it I can!! Amazon makes it all happen like magic.
4,Great!,Loving the book. Was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner! I can not wait to funish the book. Great price too. Thank you!
4,Tess of the D'Ubervilles,A very good story once you get used to the old English language. Learned a lot about life in Victorian England and the double standard for men and women. Glad I read it.
3,"Insightful in parts, ridiculously contrived in others","I had been meaning to read Tess for years and finally did this past week. I was mainly disappointed. The book starts off well...but it seems that 2/3 or so of the way through, the author became rushed....and the story becomes so slapdash and contrived I could not believe in the situations and definitely could no longer believe in the characters.The second quarter of this book, when Tess is at the dairy farm, is the strongest part. Hardy slows down; we believe in the characters and most of the emotions, and there is some wisdom and beautiful writing to be found here.After this point, it is, sadly, all downhill... I kept throwing up my hands in disgust."
1,WARNING - Don't read the Introduction first!,"My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."
2,so boring.....,"the story itself is original(using a common character instead of some nobility), but the story just keeps drugging on forever or something. It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them? So,do not even try to read this book if you have no time."
1,I hated this book then....,"...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there, that's done."
1,Sexist and unsatisfying,"See subject line. I would never recommend this book, depth and nuance aside. It was at no point pleasant to read. I struggled to finish it."
4,Hard to read,The way this book is written makes it hard to read. I only bought it because Anna talks about it so much in Fifty Shades of Grey.
3,The book is just okay for a classic...,"Was it me or could I just not muster up sympathy for Tess? I just wasn't drawn into her character. Thus, I wasn't completely into the novel."
5,One of the best Victorian literature ever...,"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"
2,Tess the Depressed!,"I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the ""heroine"" she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then. The whole book depressed me and I would rather not read another book of Hardy's again."
5,I recommend this,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tess, even though it left me raging and gnashing my teeth at times. No picture of Victorian life can be complete without reading this book first."
2,Disappointing,"This poor character never catches a break, and the writer makes you care for her, deeply. Emotionally draining and depressing"
3,Nice photos and diagrams,The book is well done and the instructions seem clear. It was a bit thinner than I expected for the cost.
2,incorrect sewing instructions,There are so many T shirt quilt books out now and my friend happened to choose one that has incorrect sewing instructions. Her quilt would have been easier to make with another book. I have several T shirt quilt books that are very good with instructions.
2,PHOTO SHOWN WAS NOT ITEM SHIPPED.,"THE FISKARS SOFTOUCH SCISSORS THAT WERE SHOWN ON THE WEBSITE WERE NOT THE ITEMS THAT WERE SHIPPED. I WAS SHIPPED THE 'NEWER' VERSION OF THE SAME ITEM. I WANTED THE VERSION THAT WAS SHOWN AND EXPECTED IT. I DO NOT LIKE THE HANDLES OF THE 'NEWER' VERSION AND WANTED THE OLDER ONES, AS I WAS LOOKING AT ON THE SITE. UPDATING YOUR SITES WOULD SAVE EVERYONE MORE TIME AND EFFORT!"
4,Swagman Bike Carrier,Works well for the most part. The only problem we had with this product is that the bolt that is used to either keep the rack up or to hold it in the down position is weak. We used the bike rack twice and the pin is bent to the point that we need to replace it with a stronger bolt. Other than that we would have no problems recommending this product to anyone else. In fact we would buy this unit again.
5,Great product,"Great product, works as advertised. It might be a bit to heavy for me (a woman) to manage alone but I'm not sure light product would be as sturdy and secure.We are able to fit out 4 bikes on it all right. Despite some reviews saying you can't put a kids bike on it - well, we hauled our little one's 14-incher with training wheels together with three bigger bikes, no problems. No additional bars for our bikes, no safety issues, recommend."
4,Perfect for cruisers!,One of the few bike racks that I found that could fit cruiser wide tires and 4 bikes. Price was good compared to competition. Only complaints are it's heavy and if you have a lift back you can't open it with the bikes on the rack.
5,Big & heavy but great,"We have four bikes in our family and needed stronger rack to carry them. This is perfect for four bikes. It takes a little practice to figure out which bike goes on in which order. It is pretty easy to adjust as necessary. It is very heavy and therefore a little difficult to take on and off, but a little assistance is all you need. The locking pin does not ""lock"" in it only screws in, so for security you may need to purchase a locking pin with a key. Do not try to use this without a 2"" hitch, it is so heavy it wobbles and does not look very secure on the back of the car. The clamps that lock the bike hold them in place and do not allow them to move but they do mark up the bikes. I just use a small washcloth to protect the bike frame. For the price, this is a great rack."
5,Perfect!!!,"I did alot of research before I made my purchase. For a 4-bike rack, this was the best price and quality. It is a little hard to put together because the instructions are not very detailed at all. Took my husband about 45 minutes to put it together. It is a little heavy but it is extremely sturdy. I wouldnt trust a cheap wobbly rack for my bikes. I read reviews that said it was too complicating so I was nervous when I decided to purchase despite those reviews, but other than the assembly,it is not complicating at all. It fits all types of bikes with no problem. It is perfect and I love it!!"
5,Light and easy to use,The Swagman XTC-4 Cross-Country Hitch Mount Rack is lighter than other bike racks and is easy to attach to vehicle. The attachments are easy to move and adjust to each bike that is put on it. Will be enjoying using this product for a long time. Seems to be very durable.
5,Solid Rack,"A little heavy, but a good solid rack. Its great for any size bike or tires! No problems what so ever! I'd recommend it to anyone but the weak!!!"
5,OUTSTANDING!,"The View From the Hill was one of the most exciting books I have read in a long time. It's a touching almost love story, an with exciting battle over Sterling Castle. This is a great book for not only the historical accuracy, but also for the story behind the action. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
5,Best Disposable Nipples,"I love these nipples. I've ordered so many of these because my son will only use this nipple. We have tried the Medela nipples and every other type imagineable that will fit on our Medela bottles, but this is the only one he would use. It's a slow flow which is perfect for him. We will be buying more before we head to Cancun so we can use with the Similac Ready to Feed bottles."
4,Great Quality @ Affordable Price,We used similar type of nipples in the hospital when our baby was born and wanted to have the same with us when we travel from one place to another as being disposable they come pretty handy. Would recommend these not for daily use but when you are traveling. Its good that we found them on Amazon :)
2,Ummm,I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me...
4,An in-depth look on Japanese school system and youth culture,"The author, Feiler, took up a year long tenture in a Japanese secondary school to teach English. As such, most of the chapters in this book are concentrated on comparisons between the Japanese school system and its American counter part. The author did an excellent analysis on this subject matter, there were lots of insightful ideas within the chapters. The writing style of this book is crisp and clear, sparkled with touches of humors at various places. Overall, it's an excellent book to be used for cross-cultural research, as well as a fun and educational book to read about. The only slight complain I have regarding this book is that since the author had concentrated heavily on the subject matter of 'schools', therefore he had to left many of the other fanscinating aspects of the Japanese culture unmentioned. It's not an all-around cross-cultural book."
1,A waste of paper.,"This book is one of many written during the ""Bubble Era"" by ""gaijin"" (primarily Americans) who really knew next to nothing about Japan, yet somehow found a publisher, usually Japanese. Another of this quickie genre published about the same time was a book for teaching profanity to Japanese studying English.""Learning to Bow"" may by an accurate account of the author's experience living in Japan and teaching in the JET program. However, that's all it is. It's full of cliches, sweeping generalizations, and offers no insight into living in Japan or understanding the culture. What could the writer possibly know after only two years?"
4,"It's realistic, funny and has perspective","This book is very good. Having lived in Japan for a year and a half, I knew some of the realities of school life. This book de-mythologizes the educational system and shows you not only its impressive strengths, but also its fatal flaws. I thought it had a very balanced approach. It would be great to read whenever you feel that the American educational system is being left in the dust. It will raise your spirits."
1,Upsetting,I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating.
5,A Great Read About Japan!,"I remember before I left for my first trip to Japan in 1996, reading about Feiler and his adventures in an Onsen hot springs. I remember his description of having to take of all his clothes and bathe in front of all these Japanese guys he just met. Any yet, during my trip in 1996 the same thing happened to me! I felt just like Feiler! The book is informative about Japanese culture and at the same time a great read. Its a must read if you plan to visit Japan...especially if you are a teacher."
2,It would be misleading to say this is typical of a JET Programme experience,"There is no one experience that could somehow describe them all. I didn't find the book very interesting, nor would I recommend it as reading for those who are going to go on the JET Programme sometime in the future. In fact, I recommend you read very little of the 'foreigner does Japan' genre and stick with facts, figures and Japanese language. And basics of English language teaching. Believe me, you will enjoy your 1-3 years in isolation and miscommunication without your head full of pop-anthropological nonsense and you will come to know your full self."
4,A rare look from the bottom.,"An unusual view of Japanese society. Seen not as usual through the eyes of a tourist, journalist, or other professional observer, but from the viewpoint of someone living there. Mr Fieler must not only learn a new job, but a new culture."
5,Best Book,"This is the best book I have read by or about foreigners living in Japan. The author has moved to Japan to teach English in a typical small town school. Quite a wide variety of situations and scenes in Japanese daily life are covered from an outsider's perspective. His interactions with the school's principal, district administrators, teachers, the students and their parents are well written in a descriptive and anecdotal way. Mr Feiler is not just a good storyteller but is a very insightful writer as well. I immediately reread the book and enjoyed the second reading even more than the first."
5,A book on Japanese culture...,"This book by Bruce Feiler is not just about the Japanese educational system but about the Japanese themselves. While it does touch on how students and teachers work together, teen suicide and cram school, it also deals with the problems of racism, the way the Japanese balance their lives and their duties to society, and even a few chapters on Japanese dating and marriage. It is full of humor, insight and clear thinking. Mr. Feiler clearly but a lot of thought into his visit and is just as clear in explaining to us what he feels is the important and major issues that Japan has to deal with - not just then but now and in the future. A must for any library on Asia or Japan."
1,Sarcasm and fabrications,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have lived in Japan for 6 years (and still do), married and taught on the JET Programme. As a former JET I was disheartened as this book does not paint an accurate picture of life in Japan as a JET. Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies. Also the frequent use of sarcasm and satire is not in anyway humorous and portrays the author as ""god's gift to English teaching"". For anyone curious about life on the JET Programme, teaching English in Japan or life in Japan in general, I do not recommend this book."
3,A good writer,"Like many people in Japan this book was recommended to me but I didn't want to read it. A friend gave me a copy and eventually I read it.The author gets so many things wrong about Japan that I wonder if he really spoke as much Japanese as he suggests. I often found my self scoffing at his opinions and explanations. It seems this was the end of his Japanese experience as he has gone on to write books on other topics.He also strikes me as quite a loner, if this is the summary of his social interaction he must have had a lonely time, which on the JET Programme is not uncommon.However he has a very good writing style which makes up for a lot of his failures. I'd suggest reading it and enjoying his perspective but be wary of his explanations."
3,Interesting at least,"This book is well-written and flows very well. However, some of the events in the book and the way that they are described are too ""black and white"" for my tastes. A good read, but if you are considering teaching or living in Japan, take this book with a grain of salt."
5,Classic,"When I heard they were making a file of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, I thought, ""good luck!"". The main gist of the book is philosophical, a hard quality to translate on film. But Kaufman does it here, with the help of Daniel Day-Lewis - and manages to improve upon the book, adding color, humor, and a profound sense if intimacy. A touching and beautifully done love story."
4,A beautiful and intimate epic,"I have not seen this DVD (not released yet) but this is one of my all time favorite films. Philip Kaufman (who also directed ""The Right Stuff"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (remake), and ""Henry and June"") combines beautiful and erotic visuals with a compelling story of people caught up in the 1968 uprising in Czechoslavakia, and its aftermath.Wonderful performances by Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, and Daniel Day-Lewis.Stands up well to repeated viewings. I have seen this in the theatre, on LaserDisc, and on the excellent Criterion DVD. Don't watch it full screen (4x3)!!"
4,beautiful,"This film, is one of the best screenplays I have ever seen (and I seen many). I had read the book before, and the film is just an extension of the beautiful superiority of the book.I particulary enjoyed the mixture of 'real' footage of the occupation of Praque and the film footage. Very well done.The reason I've only given this film 4 stars is because it didn't have a specific secene which I was looking forward to seeing.But the reast of the film definatly makes up for it.And by the way... the director is the director of Quills."
5,An investigation into the nature of relationships,"Why do we commit to one another? Do we really know? Would a life of independence and detachment be better? Both analytical and powerfully moving, this movie deals with these questions. At first seeming light and slightly intellectual, the movie evolves into something more felt than thought. The film shows what is going on without telling the viewer in words. This is a story about the nature of love in all its human forms. It is a heavy story that stays with you. Not for those not in touch with their inner self or who object to some tasteful nudity."
1,Highly overrated,"It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up. How about some more nipples? Throw a pie in Juliet Binoche's face? Anything! Just stop wandering around, muttering to yourself like a half-wit.Perhaps I don't get it, but I don't get syphillis either and I'm the better for it. Where's your witty rejoinder to that?!A real test of patience, this film."
1,the ubearable pain to watch,"This movie is the lamest peice of pseudo-intellectual crap I have ever seen. It is painfully self-serious and a major bore. This is porn for those who would never confess that they watch porn. If you want to see a good movie about human relations, go get ""Besieged"" by Bertolucci."
2,Take off your cloth,"This movie is about nothing but nudity and sex scenes! In the first hour or so there is hardly any dialogue... just a nude scene after another. The only main dailogue is ""Take off your cloth."" And personally I don't consider this as a dialogue either.I didn't see the love story in this movie... no honest expressions. Just a man who lives a play boy life. I found this movie very boring and I even had to forward many of the sex scenes that I couldn't stand any further!Maybe if this movie had a dialogue, it would have made sense! Maybe if it was shorter! Maybe if there was less sex scenese! Maybe if there was a better (senseful) ending..!"
1,Is This A Movie?,"I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)"
1,Please read Kundera's book instead,"Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."""
5,Timeless,"This film is by far one of the best ever produced: It`s erotic, humoures, sad, poetic and the protagonists are all interesting. Now, this is why many Europeans critizise American films.... They feel most productions from the US are stereotyped, all glam and over the top, while the European productions tend to move more straightforward into our human soul.... This film is one of those glorious occasions when film is high art and linked to the freespirited human soul."
3,Highly bearable.,"I'd seen and heard of this film for twenty years. Finally checked it out from the library.Truth be known it wasn't near as sex-filled as I expected it to be. Sure there was sex, and a good deal of nudity, but not much more than many films. It was more of a drama heavy with sex, than a sex film heavy on drama. I quite liked it though it did run a good 30 minutes longer than it needed to. The acting was very good, as one has come to expect from Daniel Day-Lewis. Didn't know much of Lena Olin before, but what a beauty.I can understand the complaints of this being overlong and boring, but those with some patience and taste should enjoy it."
1,One Great Big Sleeper,"I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye."
1,Either you get or you don't..I didn't.,"This is written by a 43 year old male who is a true film fanatic. I love all the great directors- Spielberg, Hitchcock, Wilder, Kubrick, Landis, Scorsese, etc. etc.""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" was one, if not the most tedious films, I have ever had to endure. Why is it so talked about is beyond me unless, there is nothing definable to discuss. The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.It's the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a ""must see/ will change your life"" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times). Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time."
1,Lacking,The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
5,Unique: Abstracting to connect,"I've seen nothing like it. The supreme and rich acting of Binoche and the abstract cinematography and direction manage to distance the viewers in such a way from the everyday noise of a thousand feelings, enabling the viewers to taste and sense all the emotion and ideas of the characters and the era with a vividness only accesible in dreams."
2,Kundera was right to object,"The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society."
3,You have to be in the right mood for it.,"I was a tad distracted when I started the movie and at no time during the first hour did it grab my attention. I felt like I had to force myself to watch it. Nothing wrong with the acting, but the story line isn't really that catching."
3,"Interesting, but not my favorite movie","I supose movie critics would love this movie. I wanted to watch it because I am trying to see all of Daniel Day-Lewis' movies. It was okay, but I wouldn't watch it again. I wouldn't say it was one of Daniel's best, but his acting as always was great. Lots and lots of female nudity and some real looking sex scenes. Lena Olin was great, I think she is a very good actress and a beautiful woman."
5,The best film nobody saw,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with."
5,"A literate, moving film","I served in the Peace Corps in E. Europe in the early 1990s; this movie conforms to my experience of Prague, the Czech people, and E. European literature so completely as to take my breath away. Creating a full movie out of the first 26 pages of Milan Kundera's original novel is scriptwriting brilliance. The film's breadth and depth of each character, the larger-than-life issues played out against the seeming frivolity of the Prague Spring--and its tragic historic aftermath--never fail to impress me. This film has a very European sentiment regarding sexuality/sensuality, however; it is as woven into the fabric of daily life as a glass of fine wine. If you prefer more staid fare, I'd recommend many excellent British films."
3,"cuts, cuts and more cuts","I like this movie very much. However I got really upset when I realized some ninkompoup has cut it in an absolutely unbelieveable way. It is claimed it is not rated, but displays an ""R"" and a bit smaller a ""PG"" and a ""DP"" rating. it stinks. I like comlete movies and I believe if anybody does any cutting it must be mentioned very clearly.I suggest if you like the original don't buy this version"
3,It's okay,"I heard this from a teenager who wants to know everything about the world.After I saw this movie, I hated the doctor character. The depiction about love is very shallow. Plus, I don't understand the transition he made."
3,A Bit Too Long,"This film, for me, moved at a snail's pace. It was described by Roger Ebert as ""The Most Erotic Serious Film since Last Tango In Paris."" Obviously the term ""erotic"" is subjective. I found nothing erotic about this movie. It would have been a good work had it been cut in half."
2,A wispy shadow of Kundera's book...,"Making my comparison to Milan Kundera's book, I have to rate this movie fairly low. I don't believe Kaufman was able to capture the essence of Kundera's writing with this film representation. So much of Kundera's writing is internal to the characters, which is difficult (at best) to communicate on screen. Unfortunately, this is the richest part of the experience; I recommend the book, but found the movie decidedly unsatisfying."
2,The Unbearable Lightness of Being Boring,"This is well acted, beautifully filmed...and pretentious exitentialist tripe. There's a difference between TRYING to be deep and serious, and being deep and serious. This movie doesn't know the difference. Long and slow."
1,"So If I'm A Jerk Do I Get To Live In Perpetuity, Too?","Okay, folks. Let's get real. This movie/book is essentially about the insipid sexuality of three spoiled brats with soulful eyes, zero body fat, and no moral compasses. Worst of all, there's no search for the compasses. Why is this exhibition of unbridled existential selfishness so popular? Because the protagonists are European-and ""misunderstood"" quasi-intellectuals to boot. Translation: culturally paranoid Yanks just eat this kind of lean cuisine right up. If you're the type who likes being hungry 15 minutes after eating, don't miss this movie or ""The Sheltering Sky,"" mind-numbing fare featuring filthy rich American ""seekers"" ransacking the blistering desert (or desert tray) for spiritual bargains that won't make them too heavy with self knowledge."
2,The Unbearable Length of Worker & Parasite (End Spoiler),"Basically, it goes like this, Eastern European intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex. At the end, of what seems frigging hours and hours of self-loathing, when they finally find happiness, they all die in a truck accident."
2,Extremely Let Down,"While a big Hendrix fan, as well as a fan of bluegrass - I was NOT impressed with this album. While the ""bluegrass"" was acceptable, it was a big stretch to extract the ""hendrix"" from what I was hearing. If you want a good Hendrix tribute album, try ""Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix"" (1993). You want a good bluegrass album? Try Seldom Scene.Overall, a nice concept gone terribly awry."
2,What a stink,I used this cutting board in my sewing class and loved it. No odor at all from the one in class.I got my mat and it smelled as though I had hit a skunk. My husband made me put it on the back porch. Then I learned that a friend of mine had one for 8 months and hers still stinks. Her husband won't let her use it inside. I went online and read that others had found the same odor problem from these Olfa mats. Some said that the smell diminished after a few weeks but others said it has never stopped stinking.I e-mailed the Olfa distributor to ask if the company has other suggestions. I may just have to send it back.Great cutting mat if you don't mind a strong toxic smell.
5,This product saved my marriage!,"Just kidding. It's no fruit juicer, but it made my wife happy and works well. Nice size for an apartment and when combined with a rotary cutter, my wife found that cutting fabric was a delight as opposed to working with scissors, or the katana/stump combination I bought her for the job before I bit the bullet and bought her this mat. Once you get one, you'll wonder how you ever survived without this...and you'll keep your katanas sharp and ready for impending samurai attack. Or zombies."
4,music's loss,"When E T A Hoffmann redirected his output from music to literature the world gained a lot. Not only did his literature have great impact with other writers, but his stories became the source of much musical inspiration (Wagner, Offenbach, Tchiakovsky, Hindemith, Schumann, Busoni, Delibes .....). But listening to this CD made me realise the world lost a lot as well, because Hoffmann was a very talented composer. I had previously heard some of Hoffmann's chamber music, such as the piano trio and harp quintet on this CD, and viewed them as pleasant but not memorable. The duettini italiani on this disc are for me, a pointer to greater riches in Hoffmann's music than I had previously seen.Other recommendations:Hoffmann's short stories, and his novel 'The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr'E. T. A. Hoffmann: Arlequin Ballet; Overtures, CPO CD"
5,A fabulous LITTLE kitchen -- Love it,"We purchased this for our daughter for her first birthday. She loves it & plays with it constantly. It is great quality and fun colors & also comes with great accessories. It is very small (perfect for her size), but note this if you are buying it for an older toddler."
4,"Amazing wooden oven and stovetop, great price","Another fantastic deal from Amazon. My son ADORES this little oven. It looks beautiful and comes with a complete collection of food, plates, pots, and utensils. The colors are lovely and it looks a great deal more expensive than it was. My only complaint is that the shelves are not solid in the wood backing. The small plastic bolt comes loose easily. It so far seems to create no structural issues, but it does make the yellow sliding door fall out sometimes. Probably could be resolved easily by adding a real screw to the backing. It is also on the small side (my two year old sits down to play with it), so know what you are getting before purchasing."
1,Repeated book material & out of place reviews,"Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)"
2,Man Kzin IX,"After a long hiatus from the Man-Kzin wars, I purchased the Man-Kzin Wars IX. The stories in M-K Wars IX were average at best. Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors."
3,Shaeffer at war?,"Some of the stories were kind of weak, but then this odd crashlander guyshows up. Finding out what happens to Beowulf Shaeffer post the Crashlanderbook made the book completly worthwhile. If you're not a Beowulf Shaeffer fan, you might not enjoy it as much."
5,Very Fast for Size!,"I now own 3 of them 512, 1G, 2G, write to it is 6MB/sec read is about 13MB/sec for it size the best you will find. I use it with RoboForm and BART-PE Boot OS, so it stays pluged in for long periods at a time and its size and round back make it the safest USB to leave in a laptop as you use it and move around and won't get knocked out or damage your USB port due to torque. I hope they never discontinue this model. A must have for the moble person on the move.Phil"
5,Simple solution that works great!,We installed these on the switches for the exhaust fans in our two bathrooms and the closet light in our daughter's room. They work great. They don't need batteries -- the low-tech spring does the job. They save energy because you can't leave for the day and leave the fan going all day long.
5,Fits in my switch boxes...,Our home was built in 2003 and this fits just fine in the outlet/switch box. It does exactly what it's supposed to. We set it for 10 minutes after we're done and it shuts the exhaust fan off in our bathroom.Saves money on heat and cooling...
3,OK product,"It works as advertised but- The spring generates quite noisy clicks when it unwind- There is no way to turn it off after it is set, you have to wait for the preset time to elapse. It could waste more energy in some situation"
1,For Simple Minds,I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives. I felt the book was shallow and was perfect for people who couldn't think for themselves. Any human being with half a brain can see through the empty content of this book.
5,excellent book,"An amazing book. Personal life stories that all of us can relate to. Attempts to answer the question""why me?"" that we tend to ask in adverse times.Inspirational and uplifting."
3,Great brand of mints,I love this brand but the orange isn't my favorite flavor. I thought I'd give it a try but I wasn't in love.
2,"The official company biography -- dated, aging, but interesting.","This is the only official history of the giant utility that serves most of northern and central California. Written in 1950, when the company (and its official biographer) were heedless of the changes that the future held in store for the energy industry overall (and utilities in particular) as well as for the end of unbridled growth and development in the state of California. Coleman is a real booster for PG&E. If you want the PR line, from the generation that build the company between 1930 and the 1950, this is the reference book you want."
1,did not work,"I was installing these chips in a G4 Sawtooth macintosh computer and the chips did not work. I had kernel panics that eventually left the operating system unusable. The hard drive had to be reformatted and the OS re-installed. A great headache and PITA. I need to return these memory modules, how would I do that.best regards,vilppu"
2,old music,Music from the 30's and very nostalgic. My father played with this band when he was still in college in 1934.
3,Swingin Japanese garage rock!,"The 5.6.7.8.'s is a good band. The singer has a very good voice, I think that's why I like this album. I've heard them better, this album has some tunes a bit too much proffesional, maybe.For me, the old 5.6.7.8's is the real thing. Their style of 1955 rock is very funny listen to.But they have some very good music at this album, I would by it again."
5,Awesome images.,"I love this book. Honestly, I haven't read it. I've only stared at the images and drawn the dragons from the book. I LOVE drawing them.Perhaps I should read it some time too!"
4,AN EXCELLENT GIFT BOOK,"Part adventure part encyclopaedia,The Dragon Chronicles is an exciting and unusual book. It will be enjoyed as much for its narrative thrills as for richness of its illustrative detail.The book appears to be a reproduction of an old journal that turned up for auction in a London sale room. It purports to be the diary journal of an old wizard, who to comply with the wishes of his dying king, sets off to find a group of malevolent dragons who are threatening the stability of the land.The book looks and feels like something that has been lying in a vault, forgoten for centuries. The pages are like old vellum and there are dozens of brilliant coloured paintings and sketches of dragons, weapons and specimens, like dragon eggs that were supposedly produced by various artist who accompanied the wizard on his journey. There is even a dried pressed speciment of a dreaded ""Dragnette"" a kind of flying piranha!Thoroughly enjoyable yarn for any age (why should kids have all the fun)"
4,The definitive book for dragon seekers,"Really captures the imagination. An exciting yarn, incredible colour illustrations plus interesting specimens of dragon remains etc.A real collectors item, whether its a reproduction of a genuine document (as claimed) or not???Some of the imagery certainly looks believable."
2,Proceed with caution,"This book is a continuation of Shore Lights, and follows the same characters as they now prepare for the wedding of Maddy DiFalco and Aiden O'Malley. I'm not sure why this book was necessary, because it didn't further the relationship, didn't end with the wedding, and was filled with family squabbles and bickering. I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline. Actually, the story was quite dependant upon Kelly and her life to propel the action. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's a family drama with no romance. No romance, no sincere story, and a lot of drivel."
2,You can't be sure what you're getting,"I ordered the samples of this product because I was interested in trying the sulphate free shampoo, which is expensive. The samples are REALLY random, so you may not get ones you actually wanted to try. Most of the ones I got were things I wasn't interested in. And I didn't get the shampoo sample. They say you can return it for a refund, less shipping and handling, but the shipping and handling were double the cost of the product itself."
5,For use in the Foreign Language Curriculum,Excellent book for staff development within the Foreign Language department. Includes tools for evaluating both student and instructor performance with guidance on how to improve those scores.
5,ISS Research Creatine. Good Product,"I HAVE SEEN ENERGY AT THE GYM, EVEN WHEN I RAN. NOT SURE IF IT'S FROM THE CREATINE BUT I KNOW ISS RESEARCH MAKES GOOD STUFF BECAUSE FIRST TIME I USE THE GLUTAMINE THAT STUFF WORKED REALLY GOOD.THEY'RE NOT FLASHY ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT; DON'T ADD CRAZY FLAVORS AND WHAT NOT, BUT THEY DO MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS. EVERYONE'S BODY IS DIFFERENT SO EXPERIMENT WHICH WORKS FOR YOU."
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good book. The author really did a lot of research with the people who were personally involved with the accident. She also did a good job by not writing the book as a lengthend NTSB report but rather the whole process the FAA, Coast Guard, and NTSB have in place to react to a downed airplane. She gave a lot of background information also and sometimes even too much. I really didn't get why she would write about the Mayflower or the history of the Coast Guard but it was her book to write, not mine."
2,A worthless book,"I read this book and concluded that I am angry at myself for having read it. Pilots like to read about accidents hoping to study a case and avoid the same mistakes. After wasting your time with worthless and mediocre family stories and the well known government incompetence, you end up with the empty conclusion that a good pilot, in good health, all current and confident ditched in the stormy ocean at night and disappeared. None of the worthless stories or ILS text in this book provides any conclusion or lesson to be learned. A line from Billy Madison comes to mind: ""you are now all dumber after hearing this story"". In fact the only intelligent thought comes from an opinion of a reader that raises the theory that Ron S. used a GPS approach rather than ILS and that proved fatal."
3,"Not the best album, but still very good","It is hard to judge this album after hearing Hawaii. ""Bach Ze"" and ""Green Coaster"" are seriously worth the album. This album also features some nice vocals from fellow Stereolab members also. I wouldn't suggest this album if you are just getting into them, but if you like the sound they do on a lot of their albums, then this is a worthy purchase."
5,EXPERIENCE A NEW AGE.,"Shutters come down, safety inside, exile at home, this is more than just the best CD in the world.... This is the beginning of a new music age."
5,"Extremely rare type of pleasant ""art"" music from these ages.","I first heard a track on the tv while I was doing something else. In a program reviewing new music. I was astonished. It didn't sound at all as all the other worthless types of modern pop. The first parallell I made was to the ""old"" 10cc. But of course, anyone who knows about Beach Boys, Brian Wilson and the ""Pet Sounds"" album would rather like to refer to those. I will go and buy at least two of the albums."
5,Correction in my previous review,"It's actually ""Hoops Hooley"" that sounds straight off the Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds"" album. I love this stuff. Get it!"
4,im moving to cookie bay,"stereolab and sean o hagan might as well be the same groop...a lovely companion piece to that cobra thing. more subtle then cold and bouncy, plus help from the lab girls. this is a solid album, great melodies and the wacky sounds youve come to expect from the whole incestuous chicago scene."
4,SNOWBUG IZ COLD INDEED!!!!!!,Well I loved Cobra & Phases....by Stereolab!!! I loved Cold & Bouncy the previous effort by the High Llamas!! And Snowbug takes right off where the last album left off and exceeds!!!!! Phew!!! Our favorite gyrls Laetitia & Mary lend vocals on 3 of the tracks and they sound so beautiful... Fianlly Sean gets funky and this album proves it...Maybe it has sumthin' to do with the help of Jim O'Rouke and John McIntyre... This album is remarkable...I recommend it to all!!!!
5,Less cold...more bouncy,"Wow! With ""Snowbug"", a return trip to ""Hawaii"", Sean O'Hagan and friends have created their most accessible CD yet. While retaining the Wilsonesque arrangements for the most part, the vocal aspects of the production have been honed to a more refined level, thanks in part to the inclusion of more female background vocals. Gone are the avant-garde electronic-bloop excursions of ""Cold and Bouncy"". The new direction on this CD is the incorporation of Brazilian influences into the already exotic High Llamas cocktail. These developments in the band's sound gives ""Snowbug"" a warmer overall feel than any of their previous efforts. I don't see how any critics could argue the true excellence of this collection of songs, though many have pointed to the Llamas too-strong Beach Boys influence in the past. It is unassailable in it's musical genius, a beautiful work of art."
3,Read if you want to hear the stories others won't tell you.,"Of course, the reason others won't tell you those stories may be because the stories are patently false. I was looking for a book that would be a good read after ""Collapse"" -- something that would tell me about fallen civilizations. This isn't that book -- at least not from a rigorous, scientific approach. The author, for example, asserts that pterodactyls live in today's Arizona.The author believes that traditional academics are dismissing the truth because it doesn't fit in with their preconceived notions. The only reason I didn't rate this book lower is that it is clearly a great source for others who feel the same way. The rest of us, however, need to look elsewhere for scientifically grounded speculation into North American prehistory."
1,Boring,"I bought this book thinking that I would learn something or at least be given food for thought. What I got is a bad travelogue full of inane information about restaurants where the author ate, people he met, what he wore. There is nothing there for a serious or even amateur scholar. Just junk."
5,The book that initiated my addiction to beat,"As a Californian, frequenter of the Sierra Nevadas, as well as a college student who obsesses over fine American Literature, I found this work to be perhaps the most well written piece of beat fiction i've read. Contrary to popular belief, I feel this is a much more mature and insightful piece than ""On the Road"" (not to take anything from the brilliance of Kerouac's breakthrough work) and should be held in reverence by literature and philosophy enthusiasts across the globe. Japhy Ryder's Buddha representation, as well as Kerouac's struggle to incorporate his new discovery of traditional buddhism with his original Catholic upbringing are representative of the Western Frontier of Eastern Thought, which is becoming more popular even today, thanks to the likes of Jack Kerouac. Bravo!"
4,My favorite Kerouac,"Although this isn't the greatest book written by Kerouac, it is easily my favorite he has written. There are many weak moments and contradictions by the characters (Kerouac) but the passion in the pages is hard to deny. He really means everything he writes and believes he is trying to become a better person. All told, it is a fun, romantic trip; this is something that is lacking in today's cynicism."
4,All is Nothing,"Anyone who has any respect for nature, the Dharma, life, or philosophy will gain from this book. Kerouac always has a way of drawing a reader in and putting you in his place. It's a beautiful and eye-opening book."
3,outdoors but not impressed,"jack kerouac came recommended by several presumably legitimate sources however, after reading the dharma bums i may have to think twice the next time these people offer up others. while i myself am an avid hiker and can relate to the sections in this book dealing with such senarios the book as a whole seemed to drag. there were some scenes which had much potential to be captivating such as when a friend's girlfriend committs suicide, but kerouac fails to really emphasize. overall i rate this book 3 stars because of the subject/genre of book that it is but i have read much better authors. not impressed."
2,Well...,"I've read ""On The Road"" three times over the last six years. It is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Having said that I decided to get ""Dharma Bums"" and I did not care for most of the book as I am not into Buddha and zen. Only once in a while a glimmer of the fun of ""On The Road"" seeped in, but not enough.I also did not like the supporting characters as I did in ""On The Road.""This book was pushed by many people as Kerouac's second best. I found it to be uninteresting and probably should not pursue any other of his books if this was considered ""his second best."""
3,Nothing like On the Road,"The plot is about Ray Smith a thirty-something (I presume), unemployed, hippie who is on the road hopping trains to find his inner Buddha. Eventually, he winds up in California and meets up with Japhy Ryder who he imitates to a T, letting you know full-well that Ray Smith has no mind of his own. They meet other Buddhists, drink wine, talk about Buddhist stuff like the Diamond Sutra, Bhoddisatvas and Bhikkhus, past Buddhas, and they write a lot of haiku poems. All the while, the narrator is constantly bombarding the reader with his strange Buddhist revelations he comes to while praying like ""everything is empty but awake"", or ""rocks are space and space is illusion"". It gets old fast.Ray Smith reminds me of a less-cool Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"".You won't find any fascinating stories that Sal Paradise (""On the Road"") had of meeting new people wherever he went, jazz clubs and drinking too much, the drugs, the sexual encounters of the women he entertained... nothing."
3,Bums but not Dharma,"If you are interested in Beat literature, American lit, the 50s or the American experience in general, by all means read this book. You'll learn a little about all of the above and be entertained by a talented, exciting writer. If you're interested in Buddhism, please read something by an authentic Buddhist teacher (i.e. the Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh, etc.). Jack Kerouac's own life and the lifestyle presented in this book have little connection to the practice of Buddhism."
5,Favorite,Liked this more than On the Road. Has a completely different feel. One of my favorite reads.
3,"""Easy Rider"" meets ""Bar Fly"", meets ""Into the Wild""....","A somewhat sad story...The protagonist, a dis-spirited, wistful, melancholy soul, who's ""haddit"" with middleclass, American society (who hasn't) and - with constant refills of his huge, bottomless wine goblet - hits the Highroad, full of Zen, Buddha, etc...I was just waiting for this guys liver to simply explode from his body...Reminded me a bit of ""Catcher in the Rye"" (odd), ""Into the Wild"", ""Easy Rider"" and, in a more odd way, Hongo's ""Volcano""...This theme of restlessness, discontent, (self?) dissatisfaction...And never quite finding a Home. Never - even with the aid of horrific amounts of booze - not quite Settling In. I wonder about Kerouac's State of Being - minus the alcohol... Sad, not triumphant, story."
5,VIVA RUCKSACK REVOLUCION!,Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks. Dharma Bums gives you a glimpse into the life of the Beats with a focus on their cut of Zen. This really is a great story and it will inspire you. On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better.
3,"Important book, but ultimately rambling and pointless.","This is an incoherent book by the self-absorbed author/voice of beat. Ironically, in attempting to die to self the beatnik ultimately implodes into isolation. How ego-driven can one be but to ignore reality in the name of embracing it? You cannot separate the spritual thin ice in which Kerouc lives from his novels."
2,On the Road Again.,"Ok. Let's talk like ordinary people. If you are someone who has to buy a new TV unless you have one, only because the TV is more modern this is your book. If you've read ""ON THE ROAD"", maybe you'll want read something diferent. This is the same book, the same drama, the same wasted money. Can this book change your life?? Yes, but also a stone at high speed could do it also and in less time. Ally McBeal or a Backstreet boys song have more message than this book."
2,Don't bother,I tried to give Kerouac a chance to revive himself after reading his most notable mess 'On the Road.' Now I'm thoroughly confused as to why he's so popular.
2,Kerouac is not that great,"Maybe I am not as enlightened as all of you, but I don't think this book is all that great. Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing."
2,Failed to be powerful...or even interesting,"One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes. (Is a person a real Buddhist if he is proud of his Buddhism?)What was a powerful and introspective journey for Kerouac, is not for the reader. I can tell that it's there, but Kerouac just doesn't get it all the way across. I found myself rolling my eyes, but still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.If this will be your first Kerouac read, as it was for me, choose something else or it may forever turn you off to Kerouac, who could be an otherwise fabulous story-teller.If he is, let me know."
1,Shallow,"I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better."
2,One show about nothing is enough,"OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac."
2,Bummer,"Not much dharma going on here. But lots of bum. In fact, I'm totally bummed out finishing this novel because now I feel very uncool to not be enamoured with this bible of the beat generation but I, just, don't, get, it. So much rambling! Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing. Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it."
3,Reading The Novel Seems Better,"Can't say that this really grabs me like On The Road did. I feel less like in on the action and comings and goings of the people mentioned in the novel. Admittedly this may have to do with the fact that I actually read On The Road before I purchased the audio book and I only read part of The Dharma Bums, before getting the audio book. The person who narrates the audio book seems bored and listless."
4,It's Kerouac...,"Stylistically and idealogically its Kerouac through and through. The idea of living a truly free life and one without boundaries truely provoked a lot of thought for me personally. It makes you want to be one of Ray and Japhy's friends; to go find a shack to live in and really exist in what may be the only best way to exist, free of material incarceration. I recommend this book to be read by young adults everywhere. Not all will be opened to a new way of thought and what really matters in this world but some will and it could possibly change their life for the better by not being wrapped around society's focus on material possession as symbols of achievement."
5,kerouac's best,"This is the book that lured me into the world of kerouac. I had previously read ""On the Road,"" which was excellent, but I feel no match for ""the Dharma Bums."" This book changed my life. It changed the way that i thought. Kerouac introduces the reader to his experiences and beliefs through his novels; they are mostly semi-autobiographical. Before this novel consumed me, i had no notion of Buddhism. In retrospect this has been the single most influential thing that I have been exposed to. This book is just a starting point for a Kerouac fan. I recommend that you follow this book with Kerouac's ""Desolation Angels."" Simple, and yet so satisfying literature. I have not really encountered any other writers who are so beloved, so beautiful and poetic in few and simple jazz talk and random amusing European literary name dropping. Pick this one up, maybe it will change your life too!"
5,"Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it!","Yes, ""On The Road"" gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. ""Dharma Bums"" soars as high as ""Big Sur"" dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors."
3,A better travel companion than On The Road,"Dharma Bums is On The Road realized. As is most of Karouac's books, D.B. is about longing for the search. It actualy has little to do with Zen and the such but represents a thought common to all souls. Beautiful nievity and un-understood wisdom. For anyone on a path of couriosity and truth. For more on Zen try looking up Robert Pirsig."
2,Sometimes it works,"At first this printer worked well, but after a year it is nothing but trouble.To begin with, you can't print more than 4-5 pages before the ""page grabber"" will start to grab more than one sheet of paper at a time, and the text ends up going across both of them.Then there is the printer driver, which is also not up to par -- where is the manual two sided printing that has been in the classic Mac OS for all of these years?In short, this was my last HP printer. The jamming paper feed is too much for me to handle."
1,"Great book, but not this Kindle edition",There's no question on the importance of Hodge's book. But this $3 Kindle edition is simply scanned with OCR and is almost worthless. It would have been far easier to read it in simple image form.
2,Poor Kindle edition,"My negative comments have nothing to do with the content as Hodge wrote it, which is excellent. But the quality of the Kindle edition is very poor. The OCR scan has resulted in unintelligible words in almost every paragraph, and the lack of links in the table of contents severely limits the usefulness as a reference source. It's not completely useless; in general I can find what I'm looking for and make sense out of the text. So for 99 cents I suppose I'm getting my money's worth. But an edition of better quality would be most welcome."
3,Skip the Kindle version,"The Kindle version available here is a horrible OCR failure of epic proportions. The text is very badly garbled, with a great deal of work needed to read through it. The actual book, however, is brilliant, and highly recommended!"
1,horrid e-text,"This kindle version is not worth the money, even if very cheap. It is a poor uncorrected ocr scan. It is unreadable and unusable. Find a cleaner edition. This is a rip-off."
5,Five Rule!,"Five are definetly the world's greatest boy band. Even though they split up, they are still awesome.""Let's Dance"" is a very poppy song, and definetly makes me want to dance as the title suggests. The extra track ""Sometimes"" is awesome and the remix is pretty good. The Megamix rules and overall ""Let's Dance"" is a good single to buy.I recommend it to any people who like dance music, pop music or anything catchy. Also, if you're a huge Five fan, this is a must to buy. A definete 5 star."
4,epic movie,this movie is amazing on HD the story is awesome the battles are intense and its just a nonstop thrill of a movie the only 2 minor thing thats bad is megan foxx wasent in this one what can i say im a fan and 2 they are 0 special features but to me that dosent matter as long as it was well made on bluray and it did i defently recommend this movie go out and buy it ASAP and enjoy
2,Plot? What Plot?,"The usual action scenes, but ridiculous plot holes. The vast majority of the plot points made no sense whatsoever, I think Michael Bay is trying to make the worst possible movie that still makes millions of dollars."
2,not worth it,mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.
2,Just Not Worthwhile,"I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit. There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one."
3,Completing the Collection,"I bought this to keep my collection of Transformer movies intact. I found the setup for the plot a little slow going. I rate this as the third in the series should be rated. The fantasy is a little too fantastical. The action not quite up to snuff. The new girlfriend has the eye candy on her side, but the mystique is missing. The returning characters did their part in upholding the imagination of the film. I did not see this in the theater, thank goodness. It is worth watching again but not one for the ages."
1,WAIT!!,"As you have read, wait for the deluxe version later in the year. So for now, just rent it for now!!!"
1,Wait for Special Edition,"I made the mistake of buying this version. But luckily I didn't open it once I got home, so I was able to return it today. I'm not going to fall for the same money trap again(Avatar). I'll just wait a few months and get the Special Edition one with all the extra features.Now me just ranting here for a bit. But what the hell Paramount, I know times are tough for everyone but do you have to do this to us. Trying to rip off the loyal customers is not good business."
4,Awesome,This movie is great. Fun for the whole family. Is action packed and we don't get bored with this one. Recommend to go ahead and buy this one.
3,This is not a movie review,"This is not a movie review. If you are reading this by now you have already decided whether or not you like this movie. I am here to write about the product. In short, I liked the movie but, I didn't like this product. All that it provides is the move in three different formats; Blu-ray, DVD and download. The weakness is that that's it. No extras, no deleted scenes, making-ofs, or interviews just the movie. The movie looks good in 1080p which does it good service but, at the end I felt a little jipped when I find out that's all I got. At $20 you get what you paid for but, if you are waiting for the full home viewing experience I'd hold off on this buy and wait for the full set."
1,DIRECTOR's PERSONAL SIGNATURE ......???????????,UPON leaving my 9 year old insised to know EXCATLY what was happening in the bathroom stall?SPOUSE was blank .... I hummed and hawwed .....IS THAT SEQUENCE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED?
1,you pay less at the theater,Its just thye movie with no special features.I made the mistake of buying it. Had i known i would have never bought it. Avoid wait till the special features come out.
1,If you're 16+ don't bother,"These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you."
2,crappy acting,i was really looking forward to the new movie i was so mad when i found out that megan fox got booted i knew that it would be hard to replace her not cuz shes beautiful but storyline wiseman they really messed things up in this one its sooo diff story wise than other towfirst off i hate the girl in it yeah shes hot but she doesnt fit in megan was a poor hot girl didnt mind getting dirty or fighting this girl is spoiled rich girl afraid to break a nail type and theres no background really to there love so were suppose to believe hes so head over heals he wants to marry her?also her acting really sucked and so did sha laboufs i thought he was on speed the whole movie talked way to fast and way overly drmaticthe beginging to middle of the movie was lame they tried way to hard to make it funny when what made transformers so great the first two times was that it was almost like unentional jokeshowvere the middle to end of the movie was excellent
3,Movie only,"Although I didn't purchase this movie through Amazon, I thought I'd enjoy having this Blu-ray combo pack. The movie is fun. Better in my opinion than I would have thought. The action is fast and the CG has come a long way in the short time between the first and third movies.My one complaint is that although, you get a combo pack with the DVD and a digital copy, you get no extra features. If I had known that, I'd have waited to purchase it at later date. I thought it was insulting to include a coupon for the 3D copy of the movie in the package itself.Will I purchase the next version with all the extras? No.Buyers who don't care for any extra features will be happy with this version. The transfer to Blu-ray is very good. Surround sound works great on a home theater system.The story is really only an excuse for the action. Don't think about it because there is very little plot. It's a fun popcorn movie but missing vital information for those interested in any of the background information."
1,no speacial features,"This is a good movie. Just stay away from this version. I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film. I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant."
2,"Bogus - no special features - rent it, don't buy.","(SORRY...THIS IS FOR BLU-RAY, NOT AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO) Would have given 4 stars for the movie/blu-ray, but I was very disappointed there were no special features at all - not even notes. That's the main reason I like DVDs and blu-rays so much...for the special features that may contain commentary, interviews, behind the scenes and show how some of the FX were done - explosions and such. I'm sure they will release another version in the near future with the special features movie buffs enjoy and spend more cash$ Who the hell comes out with a new release Blu-ray in this day & age with ZERO special features??? DO NOT BUY - RENT FROM RED BOX."
1,DONT BUYYYYYYYYYY!!!,Dont give money to these filmakers that later on down the road release a better version of the same movie..If you want extra features this version WILL NOT have it on the disc!! Wait for the deluxe version!
1,Not even rental worthy,"Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow."
1,Love 3D hate the Price.,who is on crack that they think any movie is worth 42 dollars 3D or not. This is just another scam like with cell companies and internet providers charging for data like there is some limited amount that isnt self imposed. The technology is not so overwhelming in RD to cost 4 times that of dvd and twice that of blu ray.Dont get me wrong love 3D and this was one of the best 3D movies I have seen but honestly 42 dollars just is taking advantage of consumers in a market that has no where else to go. If this disk was 30 bucks Id by it hesitantly but thats the problem with blu ray they charge way to much for the theatre experience. Sad too cause this movie and captain america are ones i would have bought but i refuse to let them think this is a good going price for the gimmick.
5,Probably the best movie of the year,"I don't understand why people didn't like Revenge of the Fallen. I thought that was great. I thought that the first Transformers the best... Until I saw Dark of the Moon. Dark of the Moon was just a perfect movie. It had comedy, suspense, and (Most importantly) action. Some of these action sequences were just great. And there were some white knuckling sequences that you HAVE to be prepared for. And Shia LaBoef was just great with the new actress. She was better than Megan Fox. In more than one way if you know what I mean =) But altogether, this was an A+ in my book. So dissapointed that it's the final one. Michael Bay, this was your MASTERPIECE!"
1,sucks,i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie
1,Not really a good movie,"This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth."
2,kind of a pathetic dvd,"I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one"
2,I feel as if I got scammed by Paramount,"Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)"
4,Great third movie,"This is a great third movie for the series. Not to happy with the dropping of Meagan Fox from the series, however this movie gave the general population more of what was wanted...giant robots fighting. There was a perfect mix of disappointment, sadness, and then again joy in this movie. There were also a lot of parts that just left me stunned...in a good way. Disappointed with the way they had to throw one f-bomb into the movie. Great movie, lots of fighting, and an acceptable conclusion to the series, for now."
4,Good but not the best,"I love all three of the Transformers movies, but this last one is not my favorite. Whatever the reason for Megan Fox not being in Dark of the Moon, there is a loss of continuity with a new female lead. There was chemistry between Megan and Shia LaBeouf that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley doesn't bring to the screen, IMO.I do appreciate the irony in the government getting outwitted by the Transformers again! What would happen, if there's a Transformers IV, if they actually get cooperation at the outset instead of having some stumbling, bumbling upper echelon idiot get in their way? I know it's in the script, and it gives good drama... but it's the same story line over and over.In the end, however, it's (spoiler alert) the good guys' triumph over evil, the requisite stunts, explosions and stomach churning, death defying drama that makes this movie *almost* as good as the first two. Definitely worth having, and thanks, as always, to Amazon for the availability of prepurchase!!"
3,War flick with robots - not even as cool as it sounds,"that's all it is. but long & drawn out. no fun. main redeeming part was some good actors happened to be in it, which in no way gives value to this movie. so if you just want to watch robots fight, this is your movie."
2,"Uggh, such a waste of potential!","I really liked the first one, and the second one was okay too. But Dark of the Moon was difficult to sit through for me. Endless dialogue with minimal action sequences, I found myself looking at the time far too often. They dropped Meghan Fox, who despite her controversial reputation, definitely added to the cast. The special effects are still amazing, but there just wasn't enough action. BORING!!! If they are going to continue with this franchise they had better turn it up a few notches."
5,Transformers,"Excellent sequel and follow-up to the first movie. I think I still like the first one better but, either way I definitely enjoyed it. ;-)"
4,Loved It!,I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
5,I love this series!,I like the new love interest in this movie a lot. Also this is a great extension of the last two movies. i can't wait for a 4th to come out.
5,Good,"I was very satisfied the product and the speed I received it I would do business with them again, I was very satisfied"
1,AVOID at all costs!!!,"If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."
1,Digital copy is expired,Digital copy expired 2 months ago so unable to put it on ipad. Would not have bought if i knew the digital copy wasnt included
1,Even Amazon Prime can't Save Optimus Prime this time,"Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this movie was. At least I didn't pay to see it and was able to read a software tech manual while ""watching"" this. The plot is thinner than the paper it was written on and the acting, well its typical Michael Bay which means you can see more believable productions at you local high school. It was easily an hour too long and the special effect have been used hundreds before. I think the saddest part was hearing Lenard Nimoy as Optimus Sentimental, I mean Sentinel. Gratuitous sci-fi pandering at it's lowest."
1,"Be careful when searching for ""3-D movies""","I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones! I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections. Ouch. All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future. My bad."
1,Awful movie.,"Standard Michael Bay garbage. Totally removed from the original idea, especially concerning Optimus Prime's character. The ideals the character originally stood for are completely ignored in favor of kill shots and 'Murican tough guy crap."
1,waste of time,"continuity was not there, story line was unknown. so unrealistic, non continuous, special effect show that even that was no good."
2,Enough already,Two of these movies was plenty. The hot girl was so ridiculously hot as to be unbelievable and not in a good way.
2,"Unremarkable, but not as bad as the previous installment","I don't even remember the plot, the resolution, or much else about this. However, I also don't remember it being painfully bad as the previous installment was. You should not go out of your way to watch this, but there are worse movies."
1,WAAAY TOO MUCH CG!,"I got dizzy watching the machines transform. I only watched the movie to see Chicago, because I live there. Needless to say, I did not like this movie."
3,Not Great but not horrible,"I didn't see it in theatres - just when it came out on blu-ray. The story is about what you would expect of a Transformers movie and of course lots of CGI. The main complaint I have is the girl that replaced Megan Fox. I'm not a fan of Megan Fox, but this new girl was just awful as an actor and the character was equally as bad. At least with Megan Fox's character and acting you could believe that she would thrive in those perilous situations (and without running around in super high heels and always bright white clothes the whole time.)Other than that one complaint, I would say the rest of it was on par with what you would expect from this type of summer blockbuster!"
1,Bleh,"It takes more than special effects to make a movie. The first film was good, the 2nd one mostly decent, but this was unadulterated, predictable, garbage, full of bad acting eye candy. The heroine of this tale couldn't find a coherent sentence with a conjunctive map. Should have stuck with Megan Fox. At least she had some real attitude."
3,3D was Meh...,"Read so many reviews about how funderful the 3DBR was and had to make a purchase. Ran home like Charlie from Willy Wonka with the golden ticket. Ploppled in the disc and after having seen the menu, just knew it had been a good buy. After having watched it at least 3 times on a 51'inch 3D tele (not bragging, just want to give folks an idea of what the movie was shown on) must say that it was ""just okay."" Yes there are 3D scenes but nothing more than watching a 2D conversion of Sleepy Hollow w/JDepp DVD. There weren't any wow moments. Overall IMO it was ""just okay."" Watched Titanic 3D several times this week and to me, is what 3D should be. of course your entertainment value my vary..."
1,"1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness","When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd)."
2,A waste of special effects . . .,"and a complete waste of electricity. Michael Bay has not been hungry for years, therein lies the problem. Let's see what happens in the inevitable sequel."
1,Kiddie Fodder...,"Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague."
4,Good Sci-Fantasy Action Movie,"This is a good action packed movie sure to please the science fiction/fantasy enthusiast. The story starts with an alternate history of the moon landing with an alien discovery twist and moves on to become a fast-paced action movie with the familiar heroes except for one, a new romantic interest. The new romantic interest, played by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, fails to measure up to the previous one played by Megan Fox.The sound and video are both first rate and will rattle your rafters if you crank up the sound high enough. The story line holds ones interest and provides enough surprise elements to keep one guessing. This is a worthy addition to the franchise and a keeper for any collector of this genre.I recommend it highly."
5,More than made up for Revenge of the Fallen!!!,"DOTM made it easy to forget 2009's ROTF. The ""plot"" was much improved, possibly because there was only ONE writer this time. Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen were in this movie. A great way to end the series, as well. If they made any more, I would hope it would be the military and Autobots working together to hunt down Decepticons, similar to how ROTF started out.Please take my advice: how good a movie is has nothing to do with the studio wanting to get consumers to buy the movie twice. If you disagree, then spam the studio with correspondence rather than deduct stars from your review.Try it this way next time: ""DOTM was a fantastic action film, but I am disappointed the Blu-Ray release hardly has any extras. Otherwise, 5 STARS!!!!"""
1,Movie is horrible...,Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture.
3,its OK,"If you're into special features, wait for the special edition to be released later.It's a good movie, dragged a little for me. Glad it's over with."
1,epic fail,"very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed."
5,loved it,loved the movie more than the television series from the 80's.......my boys loved it so much they were characters from the movie for Halloween....my 3 year old loves cars more than ever after seeing this
5,Was a gift for my daughter,She loved it when she opened it on her birthday. Now I want to watch it lol. It looks exciting.
5,Watching it on my PS3...,"Great Quality! no problems at all playing it on my PS3. Not a fan of buying Collector's edition, price is great."
5,luv it,Must i say more it a f****in good movie me and the kids love it.. If you dont have it ur late
5,Awesome Action Movie!!,"This movie is a great movie for those of you seeking for action. It's simple, fun, and it's full of action. If you're into movies with a deep meaning, this isn't it for you, but for those of you that just love action like me, it'll be awesome! Blu-ray definitely makes this movie pop out and you'll love it if you have a huge awesome HDTV."
1,Avoid.. Falsely advertised,Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon.
1,"Dear Mr. Bay, Please stop ruining the Transformers franchise",I love to see the Transformers in movies but I will never get the time back that I spent watching this movie. Good actors in a crap movie do not make a good movie. Fantastic special effects do not make a good movie. A well written story and characters that you care about make a good movie.
1,Redefinition of LAME,"I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The ""stars"" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!"
2,At least the special effects were fun,The special effects (and the fact that I am from Chicago) were the only things about this movie that I liked. The story was dumb and the acting SUCKED!! I can only recommend this for someone who has absolutely nothing else to do and doesn't mind sacrificing a couple of hours.
5,fabuloso,mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando con ustedes
1,"Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP!",This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie.
1,instant video is mislabeling it's movies as 3d,"I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection."
2,Boring,"Less of a plot than the first movies. Fell asleep twice watching it, despite all the explosions....Seems like the writers may be running out of ideas"
3,There’s no dark side of the moon (matter of fact it’s all dark).,"I found this movie to be just ok, it a definite improvement from the second one, I’m glad they slowed down the transformations so I could see the change which is one of the reasons you watch the movie. I find the story line to be on the level for kids and the dialog should follow and not have so much adult content in it. That’s why kids today have no respect for anything, it what they imitate from movies (how unfortunate)."
2,Try to see how long you have to watch before you realize this movie is a disaster...,"It only took me about 15 minutes. These Transformers movies keep getting more expensive and equally more ridiculous. The first one was charming and really funny, especially the first half. The humor reminded me of Armageddon. I actually liked Shia LaBeouf back then. This one tries way too hard in every aspect and fails in almost all of them. I understand these movies are not to be taken too seriously (I mean this is one step up from Power Rangers), but this movie could've been presented much better.The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the special effects and action sequences were exciting at times."
3,Not exactly what I expected,I should have asked my grandson for some instruction before I watched it. Moved too fast for me to keep up on what was going on.
5,Great movie,"Like all the other Transformer movies just great, one you can play over and over and never get sick of seeing it."
1,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"This is a disappointing film. The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects. This one didn't really bother. Mind numbing, and in a bad way."
1,"Another 'video game' type of movie, Whyyy?","Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!"
2,Not more than meets the eye,"20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. I was disappointed by this movie I am actually embarrassed I bought it last Friday when it came out. My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys. The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever. No character development, no real emotion and Transformers that in many scenes never even fought back. If you have to rent it skip the first 45 minutes, but don't buy it it's just not worth it."
4,Great conclusion to the trilogy!!,"Okay, first off I just want to say that I absolutely loved the Dark of the Moon and honestly believe it was probably the best of the three movies. Special effects were spectacular on the blu-ray and everything just seemed so clear and unbelievable.The only problem I have is... special features? Or maybe, the lack thereof. I honestly have to admit that I didn't really look at the description to see about the special features because... it's a new movie!! I pretty much thought all new movies came with SOME kind of special features, deleted scenes, commentary, gag reel, SOMETHING!! But this didn't and it leads me to believe that they'll probably re-release all three together in a special 3-D, blu-ray pack with 'Never Before Seen Footage' etc... etc... Which is the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5. That, in a nut shell, irritates the peediddle outta me!! : )"
2,Disappointing!,Just got this Blu Ray and just found out there is no DTS sound unlike what the description says on Amazon. Wait for the better version!
1,Not 3D,THis company advertised this as a 3D movie. When I received it it was only a Blu-ray. They told me I would have to ship it back to them to prove it. I was very upset and they are horribel to work with.
2,Provincial,"There's so much to say about what's dumb about this movie, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. A great movie when you want to give your brain a rest. Best viewed on mute."
2,I fell asleep.,"I know it sounds hard to believe, this movie being so loud and ""spectacular,"" but I was just so bored by the giant gizmos shooting at each other again, I fell asleep."
3,Love the movie,"I didn't realize when I made the purchase that I would not be getting the jacket with the movie. It came in just a plastic disc cover. The movie works, but there is no resale value or collector value without the jacket."
5,Love Transformers,"I really liked this movie. I own the first two on DVD and despite what a lot of people think of Michael Bay's movies, I took this for what it was: a fun movie bringing an iconic childhood toy to life. I grew up watching the cartoons and was really excited when I heard there were going to be live action movies. Now I did enjoy this movie more than the second one, not that I hated Revenge of the Fallen. I loved the action sequences and the special effects. I admit I watch them more for the actual Transformers than the human actors. I didn't care for Patrick Dempsey's character. I don't watch Grey's Anatomy so I have no attachment to him as an actor and I really didn't like Rosie Huntington-Whitley. Sorry, but she shouldn't quit her day job. Acting just isn't her thing. Other than that, I loved the movie. I'm waiting until the collector's edition is released later this year. I have to have my special features."
1,Ugh!,"The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
4,"movie: fun, 2-disc blu-ray/combo: bad","I must admit I thought the third film in the franchise was a lot of fun, most notably with the integration of the 3D photography. Here though is the problem: it becomes very apparent that Paramount/Dreamworks is so eager to release this, that they throw this version out to the masses, minus the expected extensive supplemental material - the word is that the deluxe (and 3D) version is coming out in November/December AND given the (highway robbery)price $31.49, Paramount/Dreamworks thinks that Joe-consumer is an utter twit and will buy anything Transformers related at the drop of the hat - well, I ain't buying this version, I'll wait for the 3D version.Oh and according to Paramount's press release the MSRP is 29.99 not 44.99 - Amazon is RIPPING US OFF - big time!!!!"
1,Bad movie? You're soaking in it,"Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague."
1,Ouch,"In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes."
2,Bad marketing,"Like that lame Avatar release, no extras on this either. I saw it in a movie theater and this one is by far, the worst one of the three. And they want to milk it for what it's worth? How can you milk it, when it is a pretty bad movie? Stay away, unless you are a true die hard fan."
3,No Special Features!!,So disappointed - this version had no special features. Now I know I have to look a little harder to make sure there are special features.
3,this movie is way too long and boring for 2 and half hours....,"this female opposite the main characther is a no talent acctess who just stands there and looks pretty with her puffy lips which looks swolen the movie i wouldn't buy it if it were for free i have the first one which is ok. will not waste anymore dollars on these movies.what hapen to john voight? i gave it 3* for effort, some of the special affects are pretty intereting. should have been at least one hour and half."
5,I enjoy these movies,I've enjoyed all of these movies. Growing up with the Transformers I was very excited when the first one came out. This Blu-Ray looks great and the digital copy is great for when I travel.
4,From Gods to Machines,"I received the message that the U. S. government is hiding knowledge about what is beyond Earth's atmosphere. But all governments hide information from the masses of their people. What intrigued me was when the Sentinel Prime character said to the Optimus Prime character that they used to be gods and now they were called machines. I can relate to that statement. I am a descendant of a people that were performing high sciences at one point in time and now we are beasts of burden. Try to talk to a typical African person about science and see what you get. At best they'll say, how does this help me pay my bills? At worse they'll look at you like you have 2 heads."
2,Dosen't play well,This DVD does not play well at all. I wish I would have purchased this elsewhere. The price for this should have been much less to equal the quality.
3,Who knew Megan Fox would be the deal breaker.,The special effects were excellent. The story was easy to follow and the writers did a wonderful job. As usual the talented Shia LeBeouf carried this movie and made it look effortless. Again. Was so glad to see the return of Tyrese and Josh as the fearless fighting forces. Looks like Michael B got the best out of all his actors....that is exept for the female lead. Never thought I'd say this but...I missed Megan Fox. What were the casting directors thinking? I'm going to buy the movie but I actually had to stop and think about it...not something I do if I really liked the film. If they make another Transformers here's a hint...if you have to beg Megan to come back? Do. It.
1,"Yes, but no cigar","Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Make no mistakes, is a good movie if you like machines beating up humans without the humans being make into jelly.The opening was the best in the world. If they had only kept it that way... But no. It desintegrated into pieces. The FXs were fabulous, but you can't make a whole movie out of that.Sorry fans. I was disappointed, but then I'm not a kid anymore, so that's probably the reason."
2,"Great eye candy, but compares poorly to the first one","No surprises left, and a highly predictable plot. But great action scenes and spectacular special effects. Tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode, but lacks the suspense and drama. My 8 years olds got a kick out of it. I got bored."
3,tranformers dark of the moon,not a good movie for under 18 years of age.i don't know why they have to put curse word in the movie when there other words they could have used
3,Transformers 3,"Maybe I'm just not a Transformers person, but I found this one to be long, drawn out, and boring. The plot was rather ridiculous (as per usual) and I'm was extremely saddened by the absence of Megan Fox. I guess if you've seen the other two, you might as well see this one, but to me it wasn't all that enjoyable."
1,Horrible,Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
2,Pre-Order Screw Up,"This review does not reflect anything about the movie. I pre-ordered this item Sept 22,2011 thinking I was going to get it as soon as it was released. Guess what? It's Oct 3rd and and I'm still waiting. Will update review as soon as get the movie. Update: Finally arrived 4:30pm Oct, 3rd."
2,I saw this movie in 3-D,"I really don't think I would buy the blu ray dvd movie, but when I saw it at an IMAC theater in 3-D, it was increadable. That's the only way to see this movie. Without the 3-D effects, it's not that great."
3,Who's the ugly blonde chick,Pretty good movie liked it better than the second one ...however the Rosie chick was completely lame compared to Megan
5,Transformers,This item worked as advertised and excellent customer service. I would do business again in the future with this vendor.
5,More than meets the eye,Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an excellent movie. The adaptation of the animated series into a cinematic format has been completed with great effect. The storyline is also imaginatively and creatively thought-out.
4,"Not bad, not the best","I am a HUGE fan of the Transformers movies, but I have to say that this is not the best of the series. As much as I am not a Megan Fox fan, they should have kept her. I also thought that the ending was a bit abrupt. Not really the way I would have ended the series. (to my knowledge, it was the last)"
3,Transformers live action movie 3,Third installment in the transformers live action series. Not as good as the first two with some pretty major plot issues but great action sequences and good special effects. Fans of the series should certainly see this but don't watch expecting a mind blowing plot.
3,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"This movie suffers the same imperfections as the review I did on The Three Musketeers. The movie is a fun movie to watch, watching it in 3D makes it even better. The quality of the movie is suspect, it has several flaws, there are scenes that fade out, and a couple black drop outs, it only last a couple seconds but takes away from the overall viewing of the movie itself, this is why I didn't give the 5 stars I think it deserves. Whatever company put this movie to disc need to check their master copy for flaws."
4,great movie,This is a great movie lots of action and intrege. Being the third movie in the series i was afraid it was gonna be a flop but it was a great movie after all.
5,kicks ass,this is a must-own bluray. looks killer and sounds incredible. definitely a great way to show off your system and the story resonates with our current economic and political problems when it feels like evil has already won.
4,Action Movie,Great Action Adventure with a really good plot and lots of great actors! It will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat!
5,"What can i say, its Transformer!!!","Just wondering when they are coming out with the next movie hehe. Of the 3 in this trilogy, this is my son's favorite."
1,Not a good movie at all...stinks!!!,"Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film."
1,Nice show but wait for the 3D version,"Wait for Black Friday or the 3D version to be released,it gonna be like LOTR Bluray all over again.First version Theatrical version(normal length)Second Version Extended Cut"
1,Same as Avatar - No 3D or special feets!!!!!!! Booooo!,"Booooo!Don't buy it because no special features are available but there will by by years end, so another clever studio scheme capitolizing on consumers! Yes, they probably factored per 1 million copies sold - 10 - 60 % will double dip generating a flow revenue for the impatient and believe me 90% of americans are IMPATIENT, so they know they have the rabbit by it's tail! Don't take the blue or red pill on this one!!! No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus...I hope this truly helps you out, seriously.."
2,"The joke's on me, I watched this crap! Coming from a diehard TF fan!","I can't believe Hasbro alowed Micheal Bay to butcher this franchise on the big screen! Okay the first one was okay, the second one was pure imature garbage, and Dark of the Moon was meh.... I will say though there are some G1 nods, but not enough, for crying out loud they did a horrible job on Soundwave, and Shockwave, and why did they make Bumblebee such a crazy warrior, for goodness sakes in the G1 series he was a Recon Transformer, not a fighter, because he would always get he's butt kicked! And Starscream getting killed by Sam, really Bay? And of course the human are flat out stupid, crude, cartoonie, and just add to stupidity of the trilogy! And Megatron is crap in this, they make him look like a sad lost puppy in ROTF, and DOTM, and Alpha Trion (excuse me SENTINEL PRIME) was never on the Ark! And Alpha Trion was never a Prime! They should rename this trilogy, BayFormers!"
2,Held my interest for minutes at a time,"Some really nice animation and some segments that held my interest for minutes at a time, but mostly disjointed and tiresome. The talented cast improves the quality of the film, but not a lot."
2,A 2 star movie at best & what a dog,"I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo. Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it. Lastly hang on to your money you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket."
2,More of the same,"The special effects are what you expect from the Transformers series, but the story line also is unfortunately what you expect. It's just more of the same disjumbled events getting thrown together. Some parts of the movie flow well, and others are just plain ridiculous. It's past time the writers & director for this series either move on or grow up and quit turning every scene into some kind of teenage behavioral prank. They've done the bumbling parents, the stuttering idiot Witwicky kid, the jive talking robots, and the goofball super secret ex-agent to death already. How about having grown adults who are fighting for the planet's survival actually act like it?"
1,Don't buy this movie,"I am glad I watched someone else's movie before I spent money on this lousy thing. I will always be on my do not buy list. Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie. It would have been better without her all together. And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox. I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste. Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program. It would have been better as a cartoon. If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it. This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.Oh and I might give it a 2.5/10 but since this is on a 5 scale it only gets a 1 and I would have given the other 2 movies a 4/5."
1,"The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap.","The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck."
3,It's okay.,I'm not a huge fan of the Transformer franchise but I was bored and it was free through Amazon Prime so I gave it a watch. It was an okay way to kill some time. I won't watch it again and it didn't make me a fan of the franchise but it did a decent job of killing a couple of hours.
1,Not a good movie. Not for children.,Not recommended for children and not even teenagers.Poor story.Nothing new or interesting.I was expecting something better.Dissapointed.
1,garbage,"Man, I wanted to like this movie. I'm a big sci-fi fan. I do not think revenge of the fallen was as bad as people say it was, I even enjoyed the first transformers, but this. Oh-my-gosh. What a piece of garbage. I rate this down there with Avatar (the movie version of the nickelodeon cartoon, also a fan, huge let down).I am very forgiving of sci fi movies as I do not expect much in the way of plot/story line. I am a big fan of cool special effects, but this was so corny, cliche and chock full of redone and rewritten old jokes and plagarized scenes, that even I could not take this. I am becoming angry even now, while writing this.20$ for this piece of copro-cinematic excrement is $19.50 too much!!!!"
1,No Special Features,"First, the movie has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. However, the real problem with this package is that the disc does not have any special features!"
2,Far too long and too formulaic,Oh please... this movie doesn't tell a story so much as show off special effects and replay platitudes. Should've left well-enough alnoe instead of making this far-too-long sequel.
1,Terrible movie with good special effects,"The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones. If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy. Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time."
3,Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray...,The movie was good. the 3D graphics could be better. I would only recommend this movie if 3D graphics is not important.
4,cannot play video on linux 64 bit because of amazon drm retardedness,I cannot play this video on linux despite having a very fast computer with a very good nvidia graphics card. The video starts playing and then a retarded amazon notification pops up saying it can't play it because of my flash player and it is unfixable. Well if it started playing and then stopped due to a pop up that has to be DRM. Amazon you need to knock it off now.The movie is fine.
1,Digital Copy Doesn't Work,Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed. Nothing on the Amazon site indicates the expiration date. The package has this warning on both the outside and inside. Amazon offered a full refund. That's a stand up company in my opinion.
3,Fairly Good,The only problem is when you replace the original cast it loses it`s basis. Not to mention what happened to the original girl. She should have been in it or at least showed a breakup. Otherwise a great film. Can you imagine Spock or bones being replaced? How about all those robots on Lost In Space and Star Wars being replaced? Or the princess being substituted for a sleep around slut?
2,The worst of the trilogy!,This was suppose to be such a great movie and it fell very short of all the expectations I had. I have been a huge fan of transformers since they came out in the early 80's. It's sad to think this could be the end of them on the big screen. I hope they redeem themselves by doing a 4th installment. Bring in Hot Rod and Ultra Magnus from the original series. I for one hope they don't end on such a poor film. I was very disappointed! As hard as that is to say. It was really bad.
2,Want Megan Fox back!!!!!!!,"I liked and enjoyed the effects but that's about everything entertaining about this movie. The quality (blue ray on ps3) is pretty bad ass.Story line is very mediocre and no depth at all. The acting was sad at times.And most importantly I missed Megan Fox, someting just wasn't right with the new big upper lip girl. Maybe with Megan it would have been a better movie? Guess we will never know."
2,Terrible movie..,"They need to get a new director and new script writer.. They just keep getting worse and worse.. Get rid of the Witwicky's.. It was funny the 1st time,now everything is just drawn out.. I never saw it in the theater and just bought it on blu ray.. I'm regretting it.. I don't understand why they don't use the original voice for Megatron.. I won't watch another one.. They should add the Dinobots,and make Devastater like in the cartoons,5 robots merged into a giant one,not a cross between a cement mixer and garbage compactor.. Cmon,what a shame.. It could be so great if someone actually cared about it."
1,garbage,"Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity."
2,Lights out on this awful film,"I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as ""immature"" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection."
3,Packaging Lies...,"It does not contain a digital copy, you must enter a code and download the copy. This is false advertisement, period. I have limited bandwidth to begin with, and now they want me to take 8 hours to download a copy for my portable use, as well as possibly have some folks get cap fees for data downloads. Plainly state digital download, not digital copy as others I have purchased include the digital copy on a seperate disc...easy as pie and copied to hard drive in 3 minutes or less.Overall the movie was okay, other reviews basically state it all. I saw it in 3D at the theater and again, it was okay."
4,Transformers,"This item was suppose to contain a digital copy but it only has a Blu-ray and a DVD disk. The digital disk was not included, from the package and from your advertising it was suppose to be included. What happened?"
3,better than expected,Surprisingly good movie. I didn't expect it to be this good. I liked the special effects and the growth of the main character.
1,not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes,"The DVD is not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes, then the picture becomes stopping and going and keeps that way."
2,Fun cheesy movie but not on prime instant video!!,"Michael Bay movies are meant to be action packed fun cheesy goodness. Which this is. The reason I'm giving this a bad review is because Amazon Instant Prime has edited out parts!! It's a PG13 movie!!!!!! It doesn't need edits! Considering how much we pay a year for Prime, I expect to be able to watch the full movie."
2,Just a bad movie,"Poorly acted, written and plotted. Sci-fi and action movies are my thing but I couldn't get through this one as it seemed like all involved just ""phoned it in"". Worst movie I've seen in a long time."
1,I Am A Fool For Having Suffered Through This Dreck,"Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall story that makes a 1962 comic book look Shakespearean. Michael Bay you ruin everything you touch. And I'm worse for having seen this."
3,Meh,"Eh, Shia Lebouf is a great actor...but everyone was just dumb in this movie. If I'm a hot, British actress... I don't think I should stand in the middle of giant alien robots shooting each other. If I am a small human man, I shouldn't venture into the heart of Chicago, where ALLLLL the alian badguys are, to JUST find my girlfriend(although she's fricken hot).IT felt rushed. Good movie, but Revenge of the Fallen is way better"
4,Love this movie,Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.
2,"Ten Minutes of Action, Five Minutes of Drama, Two Hours and Twenty Minutes of Awkward Teenage Angst","I won't say that this movie doesn't have its moments, just that they are few and far between. And you know those horrible, horrible memories everyone grows up with, the kind that scream ""embarrassment"" at high volume when, a few years later, you are reminded of the fact that yes, you were stupid enough to say that in front of those people? This movie is chocked full of those moments."
2,Nothing special about the special affects,"Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage. Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay."
2,Could have been MUCH better and shorter,"The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.Save your money if you intend to buy. Better rent and save the rest for a better movie."
2,Can't believe I gave this 2 stars,"I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan I'll watch almost anything once. This is one of those one watch movies. A huge disappointment and not enjoyable at all. The first half of the movie is spent trying to make you lust after Huntington-Whiteley. She is so one dimensional that she's impossible to like, let alone think she's appealing. There was zero chemistry between Huntington-Whiteley and LaBeouf. They wasted half the film trying to show how LaBeouf could be the worst bumbler of all time and how everyone knew it. Somebody in the studio obviously doesn't understand the Sci-Fi audience."
4,Great stuff from Micheal Bay,"A great smash em up movie (as usual for transformers) with michael bay directing proceedings. Hope they make T4 to end it all, I'M CERTAIN that there are still some decepticons to smote somewhere on earth."
4,Good series ender,"This was good series ender, still in line with the other two and lot's of action. New girl, cuter than Megan possibly."
4,Transformers 3D,"The movie was all we expected, and the 3d was just that much better. definitly worth the money. I was very pleased with my purchase."
3,Not Like NEW.,"Rapid shipment but item was not LIKE NEW as advertised. It did not come in the original box, but in a cheap clear box. The disk had marks on it, not clean like new."
1,Wort. Movie. Ever.,"Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me."
1,no 3D version,"I`ll make it short and come to the point quickly: I think its a shame that Bay is starting milking the cow too by NOT putting the 3D version in this set. Pirates 4, Thor, Tron and so many others included a 3D version. I won`t buy this release and wait (let`s see for how long) for the 3D release. I know many of you hate 3D - I love it on my 65"" panasonic and was soooo looking forward for this. just my personal opinion..."
3,Pure Entertainment,"I watch these movies (Transformers) for entertainment mainly. The acting is somewhat subpar. I did like that the parents made an appearance, they were very funny. I didn't really miss Megan Fox, but the new girl didn't add to much to the movie either. The action was very good as were the scenes, but I felt they could have shaved at least 30 minutes off the movie and still came out with the same results. I did think the beginning of the movie was more interesting than the end."
2,"This is actaully worse than Transformers 2? yep, I can honestly say it is.","A boring Nasa storyline that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to begin with, sam gets a new girlfriend and is trying to find a job, along the way we still have annoying charectors such as the mom, the asian guy, some dumb momments with sam and his boss. movie is too long with no story, no charector development, with no action until the last 40 minutes and this is a 2 and half hour movie. If the robots had fought on the moon I think It would have been more interesting and a different location, instead we get a main villian robot that is not memorable, a repeat of the robots fighting and causing destruction in the city. special effects are amazing but it can't save how poorly written this movie is. its all visual with no substance."
2,I Was fooled again,"After seeing Revenge of the Fallen,I thought this one would be way better,I thought they would have learned their lesson,but I was wrong.This movie is a 2 1/2 hour snoozefest.I paid 7.50 to see this,what was I thinking.Dont make the same mistake,just wait and rent it.Heres what you do.Rent it,get it home,Fastforward through the first half of the movie,also fastforward through all of the John Malkovich scenes.Then watch the second half,try to determine who the good bots and bad bots are,because theres so many its hard to distinguish.Shias new GF in this movie is super hot but thats not enough to save this movie,It will make hundreds at the box office because of Suckers like me."
2,Quality,The HD streaming always fails...The movie itself was fun to watch and very enjoyable. It would be nice if the streaming quality held up.
1,Makes a great drinking game!,"Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess..."
1,"Fun movie, but not worth buying at this price--my bad!","if you are like me and like to go through specials features and ""making of"" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. This is the second time I make the same mistake. The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else. It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature. Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release! The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie. I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom. As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake. I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY. What do you think? Any opinions?"
2,"Very Disappointing, No Special Features","There are no special features included in this version, which is a big contributing factor why I buy movies in the first place. Very annoying that this bare bones version is being sold at full price. More annoying still is the special features will probably come in the 3D version, which I do not intend on buying."
5,Optimus Prime,have all of them now..was a good movie..only part that sucked was them replacing sam's girlfriend w/someone else..other than that it's filled w/lots of action and all those Autobots..
5,Brand New!,I am so glad I got this Transformers Video for my younger brother he is going to love it and it is in brand new condition. Thank you for this great Christmas present at a great rate !
2,Good but disappointed,"I have seen four 3D movies on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. I was disappointed. I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective. They don't send things protruding out at you like other 3D movies do. It doesn't have the WOW-factor that other 3D movies have had."
1,Terrible,"This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
5,movie,i love it cuz it was fast delivery and my son wanted this as a movie night to add with the other two he has and plus the movie was in good condition and i was ok with it not having a case cuz the case to me is collecting dust and when you have a disc you can add inthe dvd book sleeve
2,Never thought I'd miss Megan Fox!,"I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching. I really couldn't stand Sam's new model girlfriend. She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily. I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar. Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon. Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building. There's foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they're going to be taking refuge in a glass building. What could possibly go wrong?"
2,It's ok...,"Not much of a plot differance from the 2nd one... I saw them film in Chicago in 2010... That was the only cool thing about this movie, the Chicago back drop... Other then that don't buy this unless you saw it and liked it.. If you haven't seen it just rent it!!!!!"
4,good,I thought it was a good movie. I grew up watchig transformers. Its nice to see it brought to the big screen.
4,Fast and Fun,"Adventure Sci-Fi with great FX features, a fast moving story that's only flaw was that the beautiful young lady from the first two movies was absent."
5,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much
1,Yawn,"30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me ""hero"", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie."
1,cool robots bad acting sloppy story,The Decepticons play the Autobots like a used violin and demostrate Cybertron's AI still has a long way to go. While LaBeouf and Turturro act as if this movie is their character's last episode --- and they really over-act in this movie which is lacks the charm of the original TV cartoon.
2,horrible,i want the 150 minutes of my life back. this is my first probably last movie review. this move was so bad it motivated me to take the time to do my fair share of trashing it a bit
2,"Terrible plot, interesting effects.","I'm a big fan of Transformers going back to the 1980s cartoons. This movie, like all the other recent ones, do a major disservice to the franchise. But at least it looks good while doing it."
1,One of the Worst Works of Mankind,"If you've been wondering if our species is ascending or declining watch Transformers. If you haven't been wondering, I would like to take this opportunity to pose an ironic question, ""What is it like to be mindless?"""
2,Wow this is bad!,"If your 10 years old, then perhaps this is one of your very ""bestest"" films ever.......but other than that, this is close to being un-watchable for the rest of us. I only viewed it because of Spielberg's direction, but even he couldn't save this pathetic, phony, ridiculous movie. Just not for any person that actually thinks......or even smarter than average cats, dogs or monkeys. Total waste of time."
2,Very dissapointing for Blu-ray and 3D!,This movie overall was disappointing. I so liked the first two that I really wanted this one in 3D. This was by far the worst 3D movie I have purchased. The flying paratroopers is the only reason to see this in 3D. This movie as like a very bad opera - it just went on and on and on and on ... so that when it did end you were so thankful it finally got to the inevitable conclusion.
4,Annoying girlfriend character,"I am a fan so not going to repeat all the good things already said or you already know but I will comment on the girlfriend. She is annoying. I believe she is British. The accent and those lips ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FIT this All American movie. She is useless and I did learn to ignore her. No chemistry between her and anything in the movie. It just does not fit. They should have found some American girl that is tough, rough, and All American."
4,Recieved two days after expected date,"Used an unknown carrier ""Ensenda"" - package was lost and then found. I could have purchased at Best Buy and got it quicker"
5,Cant wait for Transformers 4,Absolutely awesome as usual. One of the best actions series of all time!! You cannot ask for anymore than what Michael Bay and company provide here.
3,Better than I expected,"I loved Megan Fox in the first two, so I had set myself for disappointment. I also avoided watching it until now. It was much better than I expected. It held my attention the whole time, but with that much action it's hard not to. The dark side of the moon had everything you could want in a movie: comedy, action, desire, and teary-eyed moments. When the autobots said goodbye and walked into the shuttle, I felt tears prick my eyes - though I knew they would be back!I will say though, that as part of the transformers movies go, it wasn't my favorite. And other than characters, there wasn't much to tie it to the past movies. The things that happened had barely or not not even mentioned in previous movies, so this movie, could have very well just been a stand alone movie.With this being said I liked the movie and recommend it."
2,Well no.,"Cheesy, rushed and too much Shia. Bay's twist on this is not liked by me and much better could have been done. But what do I know? The animated movie was excellent compared to this crap and even the games War for Cybertron and the Fall of Cybertron make this movie look bad. Action parts were ok."
3,Transformers: Dark of the Moon Blu-ray 3D Blu-ray,"This movie has some good 3D effects. Doesn't make you jump out of your seat feeling at all, but has some cool dimensions. Watched it 1st on Blu-Ray, then 3D with Blu-Ray. Have to say 3D was better, just wish there had been more scenes where the 3D was captivating! Ok is my rating. Surround sound added some sensation at times, just not consistent. A good part of the movie can be viewed in 2D & never know there is any 3D..."
2,Dark Day On The Moon,"I have always had a problem understanding how anything which causes the degree of destruction as does the transformers can be of any merit for the planet. Then there is Shia, he makes me want to hurl every time I see him in these roles. The last thing I liked him in was HOLES."
3,Transformers DOTM Review,"An average sequel movie, worst than the first movie but much better than the second one.Pretty clear quality and great action. Too much focus on the humans, should feature more of the Transformers.Bluray is great but contains NO extra content whatsoever. Only contains the DVD and Digital Copy."
4,Great movie but digital copy not for android,Just adore this movie and bought it with the included digital copy so I could transfer it to my X oom. Unfortunately digital transfer is not possible for android devices so be aware of this.
5,"best movie made to date, and fast shipping",Seen the movie at the theatre and knew then it was going to be a must buy on blu ray when released. Amazon always delivers promptly and on the release date.
5,Great movie,I bought this as a preorder from Amazon and you couldn't be the price for a 3 disc set! Movie is very good and if you like the other Transformers movies it's a must have.
3,Ok printer for the price,"I bought this printer 3 years ago. It works great. The only problems are: the power cord has a short in it, the ink is pricy, not enough memory, freezes up, and sometimes will print lines or it will smear. I like HP printers and think I will stick with HP for a long time. I am going to up-grade to the HP laserjet 4050N or 1300N because of our home network. I think this model has some defects but in the newer printers HP has fixed them."
2,Good prints... bad compatibility,"I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer."
4,photograph printing,"If you are looking for a home photo-quality printer (not pro quality- but good enough form me), for a decent price. This is your printer.I can print 8X10's that come out with amazing results. I even use my scanner to print from the negatives and the photos print out better than my local store (I am not comparing to 1-hour development, I am comparing a local specialty store with an amazing reputation).Just make sure to use (and of course set the printer) to high quality photopaper, and you will see amazing results.I bought this printer a few years ago and have never had a problem with it. I don't know if the newer versions are better, but I can't say a bad word about this printer."
1,bad usb connection on P1000,"I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again..."
4,Nice Large Basic Safety Pins,"****These are your basic large safety pins and come in a package of 65. I always found myself buying assortments of safety pins and using up all of the large ones first, so these solve a problem for me. These safety pins are all the same size, called a ""Size 3"" as far as safety pin sizes go, but actually are two inches or 5.1 centimeters long. They are nickel-plated, not fancy, but do the job just fine. Save yourself a lot of time hunting these down in stores by buying them here on Amazon! They seem sharp enough for the uses I have for them; however, I don't think they would be good for any extra fine work, as they are just general-usage quality.Recommended.****"
4,When you need a safety pin...,"We are organizing our costume stock and large quantity safety pins are in big demand. Wish this came in a larger quantity, but they do serve the purpose."
1,Safety pins,As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash
2,Cheap metal,"It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough. This rough point causes the material to cling to the safety pin rather than allow the pin to pass through easily.I would recommend the Dritz Quilter's Safety Pins. They are Nickel plated which makes them smooth and rust resistant."
2,Maybe 2 1/2 stars.,"For Cena's first movie, it was okay. Lot's of explosives but I really wouldn't recommend the movie. Some okay jokes, and the story line was kind of weak. Typical ransom, give me back my wife type of movie. I recommend that you wait till the movie comes on television, and then decide if you want to buy it or not."
3,Let's hear it for the Bad Guys!!!,"Okay I will admitt that I love BAD movies. Boy did I pick a doosy! Skip the plot, skip the hero, take a quick look at the wife in her bra, then cheer for the bad guys! The best acting and lines are with the baddies. I just loved their robbery and the lines there are great. Picture the bad guys running knee deep in mud in a swamp. Then the head bad guy stops to answer his cell phone. He then tells his partner on the other end that the deal is off. He then stops that conversation and answer his call waiting. Now he says,""Does that include the sports package and HBO?"" Don't get me started on ""rock candy"" and black guys and mini vans. I was truly soory when they bad dudes all died. Heck they would make a better movie than this one."
5,get this movie,i love this movie for the action and all the bad crimanals get what they deserve at the end.i recommend this movie 100/00 percent
3,WWE....why???,"WWE really needs to stay with rasslin than making movies even though outside of The Rock, John Cena did ok."
1,Even Robert Patrick couldn't save it,"I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark."
4,Good for what it is . . .,"OK. First off, I don't see this movie winning any prizes for story, script, plot, or anything like that.That being said, I think it was a good action flick. It was well-casted, the fight scenes were well-choreographed, and the explosions were lots of fun. Also, I think it was a good start for Cena. Get the man some acting lessons and let him try something that doesn't involve as much running around and beating the heck out of people."
4,B-Movie-Licious,"I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised, and a little disappointed in my own taste, but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions, Fighting...and that's it. Luckily, it delivers both of those in spades, especially the 'splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion, of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully. Plus, he's a hottie so...Overall, just an easy, cheesy, blow-em-up, action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame, though."
2,"The Few, The Proud, The Marines","Oh boy, it seems we have a wannabe Rambo in the house! Seriously this is one of those movies that you gotta watch to laugh at. The movie does have a lot of action scenes,stuff blowing up, people dodging bullets. and none of them are realistic. The good thing this movie boosts is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a few of lame one liners, it even breaks the third wall in one sceneThe movie tells the story of a recently discharged marine; he arrives home to begin a new life with his wife. They decide to take a road trip, have a good time together, but his wife gets kidnapped oh noo! Yeah so now Mr. Marine must save her. In the process he beats a lot of bad guys. Anyway it's an okay movie to watch when there's nothing on the teliMY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5"
5,marine,thanks for getting my movie here so quick. we really enjoy and its in great shape that is great thanks
2,I know John!! Son went to High School with him!!,"I did not like it very much...bought it because of the fact that my son went to high school with him and thought it would be nice to have. It was not as much action as I thought it would be....a little dull...but not bad for his first...know he will get better as the ""Rock"" did!!!"
2,:0( BOOO!,"first the acting was so so so bad the movie, this is what i have to say ?but they get E for effort."
2,Action,"Lots of action, but totally unbelievable, just like watching wrestling. Amusing enough to watch but not to own."
4,The Marine,Good action the previews show the good part of the movie. Good plot ending could have benn better.
1,this movie is uber lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! & uber boring!!!!!!,this movie stinks i hate this movie and this movie has ripped off rambo yes this movie ripped off rambo this movie stinks the director the producers the actors and actresses all stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is easily one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Pretty Cool Movie,"I thought this movie was pretty cool for the most part. Robert Patrick's role also added to it's success and suspense. Lots of action and the storyline was well written. Maybe John Cena is the next big action star to Hollywood and to action movies in general. I think if he continues to make them like this, he will be. Thought it was better than 12 rounds as well.Peter J. Miller"
1,Laughably stupid,"I gave this movie 1 star for only one reason Kelly Carlson is beautiful,other than that the movie goes as follows,marine gets dishonorably discharged and seems to be ok with it,wife gets kidnaped,he gets beat up,knocked out several times,gets burned,blown up,by the most overdone explosions and walks away without a scratch,this movie is pure hollywood,it was a waste of money and time,you really have to wonder if the producers ever spent any time in the military,I have never met a marine worth his salt that had to go telling everyone (Im a marine), every soldier I have ever known that talks like that was always in some bar fight or some other altercation with someone,It was a laughably stupid movie"
1,One of the worst movies ever,"Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in movies. The Rock is doing it, Hogan did it for a bit. I did enjoy wwe's other movies but this...this was just plain bad. Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good"
1,what a waste,"john cena has to be the worst actor in history, wiht corny quote and stare one after another, it just shows how fargone the world of film has become, i honestly cant belive how people can pay for this. not only is john cena annoying his acting is unbearable, its worse then wacthing george bush's innauguration...dont buy it, your waisting your money, its a joke, i honestly dont get how someone could watch him unless ypu think he attractive, which unless you like people who act what their not, then he's ur type john cena is the worst thing to happen to wrestling"
1,Typical action film with strange attempt at humor,"This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous."
2,Mildly entertaining at best,"This movie had bad acting and a thin plot. Could have been much better. Lots of action, lots of explosions but didn't seem like a good Blu-ray quality movie. It killed 2 hours but nothing i would recommend to a friend to watch."
1,Ha-Ha-Ha...,"If the cover for this low-brow action piece wasn't a hint, then you're probably one of the producers target audience. One of the things I think hurts hollywood is its irrepressible desire to shove the American flag down our throats by making these ""patriotic"" movies. We have the American flag, Iraq, marines... and wrestling!!! I guess if cow-tipping is a hobby you enjoy as much as practicing a suplex, then this movie is for you.As for a review, it stank. If you see it on the shelf of your local video store, leave it there.If you're a hollywood producer, please stop making movies starring wrestling ""stars"". If your name is Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, John Cena (The Rock is OK) please stick to your day jobs."
4,NON-STOP ACTION,YOU HAVE TO LIKE THE THE ACTION SCENES AND STUNTS. WILD.... ALITTLE FAR OFF IN NEVERLAND. AND IF YOU LIKE JOHN CENA THEN YOU HAVE TO SEE IT. BUT ALL IN ALL A PRETTY OK MOVIE.
3,The Marine - Mini Review,A group of diamond thieves kidnap the wife of a recently discharged marine who goes on a chase through the South Carolinian wilderness to retrieve her.
4,For hard core action fans.,"This is one for the hard core action fans. There's very little 'down time' to run for popcorn. If someone isn't getting shot, punched, etc. things are getting blown up or sunk in water. There is an action scene I haven't seen yet with a police car. Several of the action scenes are worth a rewind and I did appreciate the 'buff bodies'. You have to give these guys an A plus for working out.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,Marine Comedy,"This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive, take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up, and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh."
1,"new answer to the question ""What the worst movie next to Missing in Action I""?","This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life."
5,Non-stop action from beginning to end!,"I was skeptical of this movie featuring a WWE wrestler (WWE wrestlers are notoriously bad actors) and because the movie was produced by the WWE rather a than a major motion picture company. However I was wrong. The movie was full of action and special effects. John Cena did a respectable job acting. The theme and plot were very entertaining, not cheesey or bogus. If you like action movies such as ""Arnold"" movies or Rambo movies then you will very much enjoy this movie!"
3,a MAN movie,Basicly this story is about a retired marine whose whife gets kidnaped from a hostage situiation. Well it's definatly action packed...but not completly true to life. Lots of explosions and fight sceans that are unnecessary. But it is very fun to watch if you don't mind random cars blowing up all over the place.
1,Bad...,"...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II""."
1,made me ashamed to have served,"This is the first time that I've ever felt so compelled to write a review for a movie I thought was horrible. But this movie is that bad.I can't believe someone actually enjoyed this.The one liners, and that whole rock candy thing??? What was that all about? Was that supposed to be funny?Who wrote this anyway? He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.The acting was also some of the worst I've seen. I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.Oh, the explosions were impressive. Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.Thanks. I feel a little ""dumber"" for having sat through the whole thing."
3,The Marine,"John Cena was very realisitic, made the part genuine and intriguing. He really portrayed a man going out of his mind with anger at his wife being kidnapped. At the same time, he was clever and covert. It is unfortunate that with his talent and great looks, he was given a substandard plot. He has untapped skills and a charisma that could make him a tremendous movie star in a story that is unique and capitalizes on his expertise."
1,"Great score, terrible quality","The music on this album could be incredible.However, there is low-level line noise on every track, the audible range of the tracks seems like it's been ""chopped"", making all the tracks sound ""muddled."" One track should flow seamlessly to the next, but the mastering between tracks results in extreme volume level changes.I am by no means an audiophile, but the MP3 quality for this album is just terrible. (I don't know if the same mastering issues exist for the cd version of this album)."
4,"Excellent Modern-day, Tragic, Choir Score....","The score by Craig Armstrong is brilliant. If you're a Hans Zimmer fan or like Graeme Revell, Trevor Rabin, etc. Then you'll love this CD. Filled with vocal pieces which are tragic, but still keep in touch with today's times. Hymn, Ruby, Ball, Hanging & Disaster are tracks to look out for. Great Cd if you liked the Crow, Devil's Advocate, Crimson Tide & The Negotiator."
2,Disappointing on several levels,"There is only a brief introduction to the images and the period this coloring book covers. That was one star off. However, we do need to keep in mind that this is supposed to be a coloring book, target audience probably children though frankly I know many adults who adore these sorts of books. The images however not simple black and white lines drawings but have shading and that interfers with coloring. Also many of the images are ""blurry"" or so details that I don't think it is much fun to color. But it could be a cool reference for clip art or examples of the gothic style."
1,heavily inked in plate repros of circa 1875 designs,"Almost useless as a true coloring book due to the heavily inked in gothic designs. Some of the designs are highly detailed and intricate, yet totally useless because most of it is inked in already. The entire book consists of gothic clip art style 1875 ink-plate repros of gothic pillars, gothic crown molding, etc. The images are printed back to back on quality white stock paper, however, markers bleed through. NO limited recopy rights at all, not even for our own use. Not even just to recopy so we can use markers. The price does not justify the product at all.This is not a Dover Publication, it was published by Stemmer House Publishers. Best to stick with Dover, at least with Dover you know you're getting top quality in all aspects."
4,Lorna Doone - a Classic !,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this book so readable- even by modern standards it is a good read, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even ..... but if you can deal with that, this is a good bet for anyone who would like a tale of England in the late 1600's... love, adventure, and even a little humor too!"
3,archaic book,i wonder why nobody has reviewed this book. i think it because it has not been read in many years.it makes me think of a popular cooky.
2,"good idea, bad product","i brought this gift with high hopes. Sadly, those hopes came crashing down pitifully. I admit that sony had a great idea. In fact, it would have been perfect for me because I'm always wondering who sang THAT song on the radio.It's cute and small, but not for a keychain. In addition, the USB capability is really handy (at least for newer computers). The product is a lot like its website--cute, stylish, but not practical. I disliked having the radio station settings so limited and the song information arriving so slowly.I would recommend holding off for a better product."
2,New Technology Needs Help,"The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the ""24 Hour"" wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs."
3,Good Unit - But Support is Terrible,"I just got my Emarker in the mail and I am pretty impressed with the hardware. However, the driver support is terrible. I got fustrated and starting playing with the Win98 drivers provided and I got them to work under Windows 2000!! If you are interested in the drivers email moon@home.com and I will sent them over to you. I hope this helps someone out there that wants to play with this unit but Sony doesn't care about U!"
3,"Great Idea, Things Need Improvement","Great idea for a product, but needs some improvements, which may or may not happen. Great idea for those times you here a song you want to check out again.Giving it a lower rating because the software does not load on Windows 95 or Me machines. Also, no coverage for jazz or classical stations, as stated above, which would truly make this a remarkable product."
1,Useless!!,"I was sold this item only to learn, after opening the corresponding Web site necessary for eMarker function, that Sony was terminating the corresponding Web service in 45 days!!A great idea but no support."
1,emarker.com to shut down 9/30/2001,"Do not buy the emarker. It is being shut down by Sony on 9/30/2001. I received the following email from emarker.com on 9/5/2001:We will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01.To keep your eMarks information, just print the screens from your eMarks pages.For eMarker refund information, please click here.(emarker.com)Thanks for your support.The eMarker Team"
3,"It works, but good taste is still a few years down the road","Sure, it probably does what it's supposed to do from a technical standpoint, but it's only going to cultivate more awareness of the music that we already hear too much about as it is. If you have tastes that go at all beyond the most commercial and mainstream in music, you'll most likely be disappointed to find out that very few small, independent, and/or college radio stations currently put their playlists on the e-Marker Web site. And knowing how operations and budgets work at these stations, it might be a while before you're able to e-Mark and research any tunes you wouldn't be able to get by flipping the channel and waiting 4 minutes. As an idea, the e-Marker is viable, but I'm still supplementing my car stereo with my pen, paper, and open ears."
4,great if you live in a big city,"I brought myself a emarker, which is just more than a glorified time stamp it sets up easly, works fine and is for me a usefull product, if you live in a big city like ny or la the site is updated every 10-15 minutes it seems that outside the big areas your SOL.. its a neat little gadget and good if you live in an area where its updated frequently."
4,"Great product, but a little inconvenient","This works like a dream to find out what song is playing on the radio. There are two problems I have, however. One is the hassle of hooking it up to your computer and waiting a day to find out what song it is. In cities with a large population, the songs get updated every 10 minutes. The other is the heavy flash use on the web site. This makes the process of finding out the song even longer. I do not have a high-speed connection, just a 56k modem. Even with these problems, the great function of this product makes it original and worth your money."
3,Cool looking but not practical,"I'd classify this device as a toy for adults, not for everyday use. It looks cool and is fun to play with, but the use is somewhat limited. While it's good in the car, you'll have to remember the station the radio was set to. And if you're in a waiting room or other place that plays radio music, you probably won't know or remember the station it was when you get home. Also, there's often a delay of 24 hours in many areas before you can check what the station was playing.This device would have been much more useful if it was instead a feature of a handheld radio, because then it could automaticlly record the station."
2,Good if you listen to ONE radio station at all times!,"I live in Phoenix, AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker. The main problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before the radio and song information is updated on E-marker's web page. Also, if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker. Trust me, it is hard to remember which one of your 3 listed radio stations you were listening to, especially if it was more than 24 hours ago - I thought the whole point behind this product was to let you not remember!"
2,"Good idea, needs LOTS of work","The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking. I live in NYC, media capital of the world, and if it doesn't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations, it won't work anywhere. If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing. It is very unreliable, I have yet to see it work more than 3 times, and I have owned it for well over a month. If you want to get it, DON'T. At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE PRODUCT,"Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest."
3,"Good idea, not executed very well","This is a pretty good idea, but most people don't realize that it doesn't know what radio station you are listening to. You have to change that manually. Also, some radio stations are not listed. I put it in my car for a few days, but I haven't used it in a while. I think most people will end up doing that. They should give this thing out for free and support it through advertising, because it isn't worth [the money]."
1,Not Needed -- Free Alterative,"This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)"
2,Small Device... Huge Disappointment,"When I first heard about this I was elated, no more guessing what the song I was listen to is called. Then I connected to the website. At the time I had a 28K modem. Trying to access Sony's flash-enabled site was undesirable, if not impossible. I had to wait half an hour just to figure out what a three minute song was called. Also, the fact I still had to write down the station I was listening to. Doesn' that defeat the purpose of this toy?"
3,"nice usb cable, shame about the product","It's worth ... for the nice USB cradle which you can use with any device ( i use my mp3 player in it ).the device itself, and the service is pretty useless. It's often provided me with the wrong song, and don't count on it having the station you're listening to. the software you download really stinks and is way too flashy (it's always resident in the system tray)it's fun to bash it on a desk though, it has a very nice rubbery feel...."
1,waste of cash,"This was the biggest waste of money ever created. If you want to know the song that much, call the station and ask them, they don't mind, really."
1,THE WORST THING EVER CREATED,"I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!"
1,Don't do it! It's still in beta...,"Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it ""automatically"" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true..."
1,worthless,"Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to ""enable"" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work."
1,rip off,no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony
5,This service works great!,"I'm really happy with this eMarker thing. I mark songs with it almost everyday on WPLJ and I download the songs from Napster. I do have to wait for about 3-10 minutes (sometimes less) to get the song name, but I'm usually in the car so it is not really a problem. It would be great if they covered NPR. It works on my Windows 2000 PC at work and my Windows ME PC at home. The technology behind it seems to be pretty simple. I think the keychain product just remembers the time. It works flawlessly for my station, which is what is important anyway. The site is a bit slow, but it is a really slick design that is very interactive. I wish it held more songs than ten."
1,SLOW very very slow,"Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."
2,Another thingabob on a key chain,"E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain."
1,CAREFUL! SONY rips you off!,"I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-("
1,Sony has pulled the plug,"Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them."
1,"Does what it says, BUT. . .","This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review. Current users are being offered a refund, but my guess is if you buy one now you won't get that.I'd write more detail, but I have to go print hardcopies of my eMarks. :("
1,eMarker shutting down 30th September 2001,Check their web site at www.emarker.com. A pity. This looked like a good idea. :-(
1,"It only remembers the time, not the station.","Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
1,Terrible,"I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK."
1,Worthless,Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
3,website offline,"Although this product did work fine, the website has been shutdown which will now make this product useless if you purchase it."
2,Challenging,"This unit is quite difficult to use. The button is very sensitive, which sometimes causes false entries. The website is complicated to use. I think with a little work E-marker will be a good product to have."
1,Don't buy this Junk,"Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk."
1,Out of Business,"These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer."
3,Some flaws....,"The Sony Emarker is a good idea, but it needs some flaws worked out first. But first, the Pros. 1.Long battery life 2.Again, it's a really good idea. 3.Very compact-fits in your pocket well.The Cons! 1.The keychain is low quality. It broke after 2 weeks. 2.You usually have to wait a day to find out what your song is. 3.The ""mark"" button is very easy to get pressed while in your pocket. 4.You have to lesten to 1 station. This is a lot worse than it sounds. 5.Sometimes, Sony won't have the song you want. 6.Only some of the songs have clips so you can recognize your song. Without this you can't know what song you marked. 7.There are many stations you can't choose to have as your station. Make sure to check this before you buy this. Goto www.emarker.com to check for coverage. 8.Major Problem! If you do not install the Emarker in the order the instructions say to, you will have some major problems!Overall....I think you should wait for a new and better model. Bye!Bradley"
1,Ruined by neutering the artwork,"I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book."
3,Scary Stories,"Scary Stories, a book for enthusiastic young readers. A book ofstories collected by Alvin Schwartz. These ""Scary Stories""range from classics and myths to newer stories such as ""The Hook"". Also included are gruesome black and white illustrations. Small childrem will scream at these horror stories, but older kids will laugh at the fictitious tales. With 104 pages of stories the book will last awhile. I recommend this book for young readers ages 1-12."
1,Not the Nightmare-fuel from my childhood,"Don't waste your time or money. Buck up and spend the extra for an original Stephen Gammell illustrated version. If you're buying it for a kid who may in fact be a total wiener, then by all means get this one. But then, why are you buying the little wiener horror stories?Stephen Gammell's version will help develop a child's hippocampus and exercise their innate terror response. This one is lame."
1,These are not the Stephen Gammel illustrations!!,"I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries. I have the originals and I will keep them for posterity."
1,A watered down version of the original,"I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book."
1,Worthless Edition.,"Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools."
1,How Dare They...,"How dare they censor the original?? The Stephen Gammel illustrations were incredible! The art was what made these books great! The writing is still good, but the new drawings are just nowhere near as good as the old ones! Skip this one and buy the old version(s)!!"
1,Missing what made the original versions great: The art!,"Alvin Schwartz's stories always played second fiddle to Stephen Gammell's art. Without it, this book is not worth anyone's time or money. Avoid it and seek the originals."
1,Also displeased with the new art.,"As another child who was scarred by the terrifying art style in the original books, I was extremely excited to hear about the re-release of these classic stories. The books arrived today; lo and behold the original art has been replaced with bland, uninteresting art that would be better suited in an R.L. Stine novel.A wasted purchase..."
5,"INSANELY SCARY,MAN!","This book is scary stuff! I read a story, ""Me-Tie-Doughty-Walker"" that scared the stuffing out of me! Now I'm in seventh grade, and the book still gives me chills when I'm reading it alone! The pictures are so trippy and disturbingly graphic!"
4,Scary Stories,"If you like scary stories you will like this because it is scary. The book I am reading has dead people in it. Dead people come alive and kill people. Then they would eat that person.Some of the dead will just walk away. Then, the person who sees that dead person freaks and dies. The ghost of the dead person will just walk away. Finally when one the guys or girls run so fast they bump right into the ghost or the dead person and just kill that person who bumps into them."
4,Scary stories you'll remember for years,Horrifying and haunting short stories illustrated with mentally disturbing sketches. I used to pull this book out at slumber parties and we'd all freak ourselves out. I still remember some of the short stories to this day.
1,Artwork???,Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.
1,The art is a joke,"This isn't the original art for these books. They hired a cheap hack to make the illustrations ""less scary"". The original had a better artist and better illustration. Dont waste your time on this pussified version."
1,Scary Stories that are no longer scary.,"The original books contained haunting, even downright frightening illustrations that still disturb me to this day. They made these stories scary. They were original, artistic, beautiful and downright horrifying, and have been replaced by bland, boring, and shamefully dull. If you want something that will scare you, find a copy of this book with the original artwork by Stephen Gammel."
1,These are not the books you grew up with...,"Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself."
1,Do Not Buy This Edition,"Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special."
4,PERFECT FOR TELLING AROUND THE CAMPFIRE!,"SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK has classic campfire stories, such as ''The Hook'', and ''Me-Tie Daughty Walker'' along with lesser known tales like ''Alligators'' and ''May I Carry Your Basket''? Some stories are funny, such as ''The Viper'' (I've come to vipe your vindows) and ''The Ghost With Bloody Fingers'' (cool it dude, get a band-aid) while others are genuinely spooky, like ''The Guests'' and ''Cold as Clay''. The book was clearly intended for reading out loud, many stories even have tips for the reader, such as when to raise and lower your voice. Stephen Gammell's pictures are mysterious and darkly beautiful. I highly recommend this book for those looking for a spooky read aloud."
4,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark didn't really have much of a plot, since it is a collection of short stories. In one of the stories, The Girl who Stood on the Grave, the plot is a girl was given a dollar to prove that if you stand on a grave, then the person who's grave it was wouldn't grab you and pull you under. She was to stick a knife in the grave so her friends know she was there. She put the knife through the grave, and tried to get away, but she that she was being held back, and she died of fright. The setting is at a graveyard at night. The conflict is that the girl tried to prove the fact that if you stand on a grave at night, then the person under it will pull you in wrong. It wasn't resolved, but the girl died of fright because she thought she was being pulled under, when she had just put the knfe through her dress on accident."
5,Scary as heck!,"This, along with the other two books in the series, is a classic. Alvin Schwartz's tales are so simple yet so deviously scary, and Gammell's dark, surreal illustrations greatly enhance them. Actually, some of the illustrations are midly disturbing...(what IS that thing coming up the stairs in ""The Voice""?) Once you've read at least a couple of them, you'll start to realize just how scary the world is...(for instance, ""The Girl who Stood on a Grave"", ""The Red Spot"", and ""No Thanks""). So give them a try...you won't be dissapointed!"
5,NIGHTMARES,"YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}."
3,NOT VERY SCARY,MY HUSBAND GOT THIS BOOK TO READ TO OUR 7 YEAR OLD NIECE. NOT VERY INTERESTING AND DEFINATELY NOT SCARY. IT WASN'T WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.
3,IT WAS FUNNY,SCARY STORYby ALVIN SCHWARTZTHE BOOK IS A GOOD BOOK.IT TELLS ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENTSCARY STORIES.FOR INSTANCE THE FIRST SCARY STORYWAS CALLED BOO MEN.IT WAS ABOUTTHREE MEN WHO DIED IN THEREHOME.THEN CAME BACK TO HONTAND KILL THE PEOPLE LIVINGIN HIS HOUSE.I WOULD RecommendTHIS BOOK BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY ANDIT'S A GOOD HALLOWEEN BOOK.
2,Jake's,"I did not like this book because it was not like a complete story. It just had little mini stories in it. I also did not like it because some of the authors who wrote the stories did not finish them. One more reason is there are a lot of pages, but it is not hard so it makes it too easy to read.The book Scary Stories is a book filled with about 10 different stories. It is very scary andit just makes you want to scream! This book will scare its reader half to death.The type of reader that would like this book is maybe someone who watches a lot of horror movies. The reason is because it really scares you. The reader would also have a strong stomach because it is a gross book."
2,"Scary when I was little, not years later.","I first found this book when i was little--and yeah, then it scared me more. I found it recently in barns and nobles, and wanted to buy it to re read it. Big mistake.This book is more hysterical than scary to me. I didn't even feel a little scared. Big disappointment for me. my advice? read it when you are younger, it might acutally be scary then."
2,Warning for customers,"Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition."
1,This was just a mistake.,"Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."
1,Bring back Gammell,"The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. Congratulations on putting out an edition that looks exactly like every other scary stories for kids book, instead of the ONE that literally everyone remembers from their childhood.Great way to commemorate the anniversary."
1,"""I Can Read"" book has better illustrations","While the stories in the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" book remain the same, the Stephen Gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy-coated pictures.How candy-coated? Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, ""In A Dark, Dark Room"", which was written for Level 2 of the ""I Can Read!"" children's collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark."""
1,Buy the original.,"I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed."
1,The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not...,"I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the ""scary"" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it's a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator."
5,"Wow, so creepy as a child!","Okay, I had all three books when I was a kid. The original ones look like their worth some money so I'll be kicking myself in the back later. If these new ones stay true to the stories from the 90's editions, then you need to buy all three of them for your kids. The stories are pretty freaky for kids, but if I recall, most of them do state some lessons to be learned. Definitely buy all three."
2,Not what I remembered as a kid...,"This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple ""classic"" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile"
2,Good for younger readers,"[Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will enjoy it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven Kind book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. I expected ""real"" ghost stories with substance. The book only has short folklore legends."
4,ain't nothing like the new jack swing yep yep,"that was my last favorite era in the R&B movement and talk about a musical gumbo? it had so much pressence and flavor. alot of important acts came along during this time period.great hybrids of styles,beats and grooves. so many incredible talents on this compilation."
4,History of Fantasy,"Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom."
2,Average Lost Civilization Fantasy,"Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5.5/10The writing style is good and all the elements of a great story are present. If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right. Perhaps the author felt that a simple adventure needed a twist of some sort. Well it did feel twisted, but not in a good way.Claus Kellermann2006 April 15Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"
5,Great Jam!!,This is truly wonderful gooseberry jam. It is packed with chunks of gooseberries. I highly recommend this product!! It truly met my expectations.
3,"Quite a good course, but not compared to Tuldava's","For some reason, the Indiana University has published two different courses in Estonian. This one, and the Estonian Textbook by Juhan Tuldava. While this book is certainly as good as many other language courses on the market, it falls short of the level reached by Tuldava's course, both in terms of user friendliness and in depth cover. For this reason, I would recommend Tuldava's Estonian Textbook rather than this course."
1,Racism and Sex,"This would have been a very short book if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this."
3,No water sound,"With the step fountain there is no water fountain noise, maybe a good thing for some people. I wanted to hear the water effects for my office but this didn't make any noise, but its nice to look at. I'm going to try the rock style fountain."
2,Bellydance Magical Motion,"I am a first-timer and it can be rather intimidating to admit for an older woman in her mid-forties! I wanted a video that was decent, and this one surely is. Atea's moves were clear and it helped me to get a good start, but I quickly became bored with it because it lacked FLOW, and I was disappointed that the moves that she so clearly shows do not connect together to form a dance routine. This is what I am looking for. For a beginner to be expected to make a dance out of a bunch of new moves is unrealistic, and I will continue to look for a video that will offer this. If I am to dance like this in front of my husband, (which is mainly why I am learning) I would not be able to show him a routine by learning this video because I am a beginner and don't know how to put the moves together yet. The whole idea is BellyDANCE, and not just Belly EXERCISE, and with the CONFIDENCE I need to dance this way!"
3,It's ok but I'm glad I bought it used.,I have purchased several other bellydance dvds and videos and I will say I'm glad I purchased this one used for a lesser price. I don't care about the age of the video or the costumes or makeup... I was looking for instruction and I really didn't find it here. I found her not exceptionally easy to follow and I don't think much time was taken for those of us who are novices to bellydance. I can't afford to take lessons where I live so I am having to rely on video and dvd. This one really hasn't been all that helpful for me. Others may be able to follow her better than me but I haven't found her teaching style to be one easy for me to grasp and follow.
4,Atea's a classic!,"Just so everyone knows, Atea is NOT that stiff in real life! She must be camera-shy (a lot of us are). She is an excellent dancer, although she could use a bit of meat on her. Still, for basic moves and correct technique, it's a good starter video."
2,disappointing,"I was very dissapointed with the quality of this video. During the entire video, you could see the woman reading the cards behind the camera. The ladies did not teach any moves that you could not just make up on your own."
2,very simple interpretation of bellydance,"I take group bellydance classes and have been to seminars and workshops. This is bellydance but only the very simplest form. Atea is ok and this is a good tape to start with if you are not sure how serious you are about learning. It introduces you to things like veil and zills but it does not instruct you on them. If you are sure you want to dance you should shop around spend just a little more money getting a tape from someone/troup that dances a style you are interested in and has a well known face and name. For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several."
2,"beginners only, maybe","Beginners who would like a quick view into some dance might take advantage of this video. There is an attempt to cover a lot of ground, but none of it is done well. Altea is too angular, stilted and her dancing is not that interesting. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for quality dance instruction videos. I will say that this is the first video that I've seen that touches on rhythm and zill work. The variety in costume is interesting, but is not worth the price. I recently acquired several of the Neena and Veena series of dance tapes. These are excellent beginner tapes, they are fun and interesting and they show a great little dance at the end as a reward for your work-out. This series would be a better choice for beginners."
1,It's a shame there are not 0 stars on ratings,Reasons not to buy this video:1. She reads from cue cards the entire time.2. She's extremely stiff and boring.I have only watched this video once in the two years that I have owned it.
1,Scary,I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like.
2,There are far better tapes out there...,"If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance."
1,Frail White Women Wriggle About,"While the basic instruction is passable, the technique of most of the dancers, including the instructor, is mediocre to poor. What's truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There's an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a ""wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband"" sort of vibe. Culturally divorced and ugly-American scary. Made me want to shave my head and get tattoos."
2,should have known better,"For basic instruction this tape is OK. Her oral description of the techniques is clear. Atea is not relaxed at all in her instructions or moves. In the instruction part of the video she seems like a puppet controlled by strings. She is too skinny, unattractive and doesn't even have an attractive navel. She fails to hold your attention. Her other dancers are a bit better, but the whole tape seems so contrived and does not move with a natural flair. For verbal instruction, OK, for visual efects you can get much better. And the dance at the end is a real joke. Your money is better spent on Suhaila!"
2,Disappointed,"This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to ""freestyle"" and ""improvisation"". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy."
2,Not My Favorite,"I found this tape very disappointing, it was fun to watch once, but the amount of information provided was very small and too choppy. There are many belly dance instructional videos available which are more interesting, better taught and more informative about how to dance and which provide you with a workout as well. My recommendation is to keep looking."
4,Newbie Review,This video has advantages over the others I have bought in several ways-The photography is clear and moves close enough to the dancers (in the relevent area) to allow someone new like me to actually understand what they are doing.She explains clearly what she is doing. Pretty rare!The secondary dancers are different from segment to segment highlighting thier strengths and getting a better taste for different styles.There are dance sections showing how the moves just shown can be used in dance.Overall- Good! Wish I could find a teacher in Las Vegas.
1,Unreliable,"Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail."
4,Dope.,But divisive statements like the one above (or is it below) about D-12 are not needed in hip-hop. If you can't say something nice....
1,Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write,"Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."
2,"The original recording probably sounded good, but the mastering on this CD is poor...","Whoever mastered this CD had no idea what they were doing (this makes me wonder what other CDs on this label are like). They use about one-quarter of the dynamic range available with 16-bit audio. Five bucks is pretty cheap for the disc, but you get what you pay for in this case. I'd probably opt for the other Eddie Fisher CD that has multiple albums (one of them being a Christmas CD) on it."
4,An atmospheric look at Morocco,"This is one of the better books I've seen that gives a real feeling for Morocco, their lifestyle, culture, colours, ambience etc. There's a wonderful balance of writing and photographs (none of which are ""touristy"" style pics!). it's one of those pieces where you can read & finish, and come away with a real feeling for the place, and a real respect for it's historical contexts.My only downer is that the bookbinding technique is miles too lightweight for pages of this quality and weight, and on just the second opening the stem came unstuck and fell apart. Still, with some tender loving care this will stay on top of the coffee table for years to come.Worth grabbing if you have a romanticised love of north Africa and it's people."
3,LIVING IN MOROCCO,BOOK ARRIVED IN POOR CONDITION WITH THE BACK UNGLUED. OTHERWISE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PHOTO ESSAY
3,Living in Morocco,"This is a beautiful book. Unfortunately, the cover broke away from the binding after only a couple readings."
1,mediocre,"i didn't care for this cd. it is a Christian goth group that has disappeared and I can see why. not anything special. if you are a collector of christian goth, a friend of the bands, or a fan then get it otherwise don't waste your time."
4,Idaho Geology,"If you want to know how Idaho is assembled geologically, this is for you. It is the most readable book on the topic and more complete than other tomes. I strongly recommend it for the amateur geologist."
3,Good read for the price,"I thought this collection was ace! The one set in the museum was the best. It was kind of creepy and sad in parts but has a very interesting story and the end explains a lot. If you have kids, they will like this one too.I did not like so much ""M.C. Higgins the Great"" which I thought was more for boys. I didn't read this one though so I don't know what it's about except for the first five pages.For all your parents out there my Mom liked ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankwiler"" as well. If you liked reading you will like this even if you are any age at all.I am still reading ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimth"",I also recomend ""When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit"" in another book."
4,SYNTHASIZED HARMONY,"ELECTRIC SYKCHURCH IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF TODAYS RAVE SCENE. WANDERING THROUGH YOUR BODY LIKE A FLOW OF POSITIVE ENERGY. ITS A GREAT GROUP TO LISTEN TO, WHEN THE SUN IS COMING UP, AT A DESERT PARTY. A PERFECT END TO A NIGHT OF DANCING."
5,Amazingly beautiful trance cd.,This is the perfect cd to put in after a night of partying. Great to chill out to. Track 5 and 6 are just amazing.
5,awesome,This has to be the best group of performers I've ever enjoyed. I've seen them 4 times.. well 5 times.. once on the 55 freeway.. :P This is cd is very creative and will set you in the mood that will take your mind away from everyday life.. GET IT!!! -Darkpeace (Moontriber 4 life)
3,Not true to size,"I purchased a pair of these in size 14 Wide. The boots I received were labeled as wide. They fit like mediums though. If you have a regular foot width, I am sure these boots are good because my wife owns a pair in regular width and she likes them."
3,Really wanted to like these....,"I really wanted to like these boots, because they feel solid and comfy, but they were too small around the toes - side to side. I usually wear a 7W, so I got both 7W and 7.5W, and both were to small across the toe. I may try 8W."
3,"VERY Narrow, poor inserts","I want to like these boots. They are pretty well made, and look like they will last a good while. They have one significant issue - they fit my foot, but are very stingy with material around the ankle bones. Almost not enough tongue to cover, but only where the ankle joint is widest. I have never had a boot fit this way.Secondly, the inserts are useless, and had to be thrown out immediately.I will wear them for a while and see how they fare, and I may revise his review."
2,Tongue hurt my ankle,"The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately, the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe. Didn't matter which sock I wore. I had to return."
4,Great product,"Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
5,Nice boot,I bought these for my boys for Christmas and they love them so much they refuse to take them off. They told me these are the best pair of shoes/boots they have ever had.
3,nice boot,The boot was well priced and solidly built but not true to size.I would go at least a half size smaller.
4,Good Deal On Amazon,"I have bought about 20 pair of these boots over the past 6 or 7 years. I usually buy them 2 pair at a time and wear one for work and one for good.Even when you buy them at the buy one get one half price in stores the price on here is by far cheaper than anywhere else.They are comfortable, waterproof, last a long time and are light weight."
3,Sizing off,"These seemed like good quality boots, however the sizing was 1/2 a size off. I ended up returning the product so I can't speak for actual comfort or longevity of product. But it is frustrating when a product doesn't fit. Shoes are usually pretty constant too. I purchased these particular ones based on all the great reviews but I didn't see any that commented on sizing issues, so just beware."
5,Excellent Boots!,"These boots are an excellent value. They are comfortable, provide great heel and ankle support, good grip, and keep your feed warm and dry in cold climates.Purchased a pair for a vacation in New Brunswick, Canada. These boots kept my feet dry and comfortable the whole time, even while snow shoeing and hiking across a snow covered beach front. Didn't slip once in them, though I encountered ice a few times.Very good purchase!"
4,Men's High Tec Boot,This boot is comfortable and gives me the ankle support I've needed for any type of hiking. I look forward to many years of use from these boots.
4,Good Boots,Comfotable fit on the loose side. I use a heavier sock and works just fine. Recommended and would buy again.
5,Hi-Tec Altitude,"I first purchased a pair of Hi-Tech Altitude boots approximately 10 years ago. They fit me extremely well and were very comfortable from the first moment I wore them. Prior to this purchase, I have had 2 different pairs of the Hi-Tech Altitude boots and I have not been disappointed. They wear extremely well and seem to last me about 4 or 5 years. I have found them excellent for everyday wear as well as for use in fishing and hunting. I think these are excellent low cut boots for such a moderate price. Haven't ventured into buying the $100+ boots, but then why should I when these work so well, so can not comment or compare my $70 Hi-Techs to the more pricey boots. I think you will be pleased with these boots."
4,Good Boot,These are very nice boots. Love the styling and appearance. They do need to be broken in a little when you first get them.
5,Only shoe my husband will wear,"Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future."
4,Look Good,These boots feel and fit great. I am interested in how long they will hold up. They look pretty sturdy. I will put them to the test for sure.
2,Had to return,Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles. I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just didn't work.
2,Overhyped?,Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box.
2,"Great boot, Sturdy, Comfortable, But those darn laces!!","They keep coming untied! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. The boot is waterproof, it is comfortable, wont give you calluses or corns. But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it, they will inevitably become undone! The first time: ""umm? maybe I should tie them tighter"", The second time: ""just a little tighter, Ugh it's cutting my circulation"", The third time: ""Ok this is ridiculous, let me try tying em different"", the unfteenth time: ""you m$#%^ stupid $%^ Boot from hell $%^&..."" lol I threw the boots into a lake and hiked in my sandals the rest of the way... Never again will I buy boots with hooks for tying...thanks for reading"
1,Cheaply made boot,"Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!"
2,Not comfortable,These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable. I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day. The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up. I would not recommend these to anyone.
5,Great Boots,"Went to Yellowstone in these boots. They were comfortable, waterproof and did well on the 328 steps to get down to lower falls."
4,Happy Feet,"These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!"
5,Mercacia pendiente por despachar.,"Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking BootEste producto fue comprado y cacelado junto con una cartera para caballero NAUTICA Men's Trifold Wallent y numca fue enviado, este comentario lo he enviado muchas veses pero no me han solucionado nada, no voy a rrepatir mas este mensaje, pero no realizare mas compras por esta pajina debido a lo que esta sicediendo."
5,More than one year used a lot !,"Exactly I'm using this ones from 16 months, ALL the sundays, and in some trips to the mountain and beach for a complete week, they are great in all the ways! I can't hope something better from a daily used and/or hicking shoes! Another thing to consider; I'm a ""big and heavy boy"":6 ft.2 in.and 225 lbs."
3,Altitude IV,"Expensive shoes, I was really excited about it but got a little dissapointed with it, quality little low, materials seems to be cheap"
3,feels well made,relatively comfortable. The front of my ankle hurts if i lace it too tightly. We will see if this improves with breaking it in.
4,Very comfortable,These arrived quickly fit great and are very comfortable. I bought these for general use during colder months to replace sneakers.
3,Not for me,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
3,HiTec Boot Review,"This is the second time I purchased these boots. The first time (7 years ago) everything was good. This time I gave the boots a 5 week break-in period but after two days on the trail I had some pinch points, but no blisters. The real disappointment was the waterproofing. Of the 5 days I was out on the trail I had 3 days of rain or overcast. On the first day after 5 hours of wet grass I had wet feet. I was hoping to keep my feet dry this trip."
3,Men's Altitude Hiking Boot,These were my first pair of boots. Bought them for motorcycle safety training (needed footwear that covered the ankles) & been using them sparingly over the last year. The shoes are a nice dark shade of black but the lace rings are a little too shiny for my liking. Price could be cheaper too. No other complaints.
5,Great all season Boot!,I've now had these boots for a month and they just continue to impress me. They were comfortable right out of the box so break in was very quick. I've worn them day hiking and have had no problems with hot spots.Even though they are waterproof I still recommend spraying them with silicone.5 Stars!
4,Hi Tec Altitude 4 mens boot,Comfortable boots that are indeed water proof and actually do breathe. They seem to work well for the winter wearing anything from cotton socks to solar socks depending on the outside temperatures. It should be noted that they do not have a slip resistance sole so they can be slippery on smooth wet surfaces. I haven't had a chance to use them in warmer weather to see fully how well they breathe. For the price they are a very good buy.
3,"Comfortable but felt ""Off""","These boots felt somewhat weird in their arch support. I have size 14-15 feet, and I have learned to be somewhat less picky since most stores don't carry my size. However I desired a comfortable boot that I can hike as well as work outside in. I had some LLBean boots that I worked into the ground, and unfortunately you just can't find quality that easily these days (I sound like my parents now).I cannot comment on Hi-Tec's durability or longevity because I ended up returning these boots and buying a pair of Wolverine work boots that were slightly more expensive."
4,Returning Customer,"I'm on my 5th or 6th pair of these boots. I'm a meat cutter. I'm on my feet, in the cold for 8 hours a day. My feet are warm, dry, and comfortable. When I wear these out, I'll buy another pair. End of story."
3,Runs small and narrow,This review is not about the quality of the shoe (which looked quite satisfactory) but about the sizing.The shoe runs both small and narrow (even though i ordered a wide).FYI- if that happens and you have to return it- You will have to pay for the return shipping to amazon
3,They run large,I ordered thise for my son for Christmas. He usually wears a 13 but would have needed a 12 in these. He didn't really like them for hiking; they are more of a work boot. You can't just ship these back to amazon; you have to pay to do it.
5,Nice boots!,"I ordered these in fall when I was going for a backpacking trip and I could just forget about twisting an ankle or anything. Wear these, step on any kind of surface with confidence, lots of grip, good support for the ankle. Will highly recommend these for snow as well as adventure!!"
4,Happy with purchase,"I had initially purchased a pair of Asolo Moran GTX. Although they were great boots, wearing those around the house made me realize that the right boot pinched a bit too much for my liking. Those got returned and in desperation picked up a pair of these. For the price (roughly 1/3 of the Asolo) these are fantastic boots.Break-in was fairly quick with my biggest problem area being around the shin. A strategic fold of the smartwool socks intially took care of any discomfort for the test hikes around the neighborhood. I have had no issues with the boots since then. I have deliberately stepped into streams to test the ""waterproofness"" noting no problems. The traction seemed fine.Great boots and will most likely purchase them again."
4,Good boots just not waterproof.d,Overall pretty good books. I just went on a 3 day Horn Hunting Hike in North East Wyoming and these boots held up good. The only downside was the boots need to be treated before plowing through snow drifts. My feet did get wet. Luckily I did have polypropelene liner socks with wool outer socks so my feet did not blister or get cold. Considering the extreme terrain and weather these boots served me well.
4,This is my second pair. The first pair lasted 30 years and I'm expecting to see another winner with this pair!,These boots are nice looking and well designed. I have an ankle injury which is well supported by these boots.
1,not good,3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
1,Cheap Boots,Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots.
1,VERY NARROW,"This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast"
1,Horrible,"Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear."
2,Heavy and Stiff,"I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction."
1,not up to her standards,not nearly as good as her usual work if your hoping to hear her forget it it is a pale comparison with authors who don't have her style
2,"I'm great, everyone else stinks","I am sympathetic to the perspective of this author, but not to his arrogance or all of his smug conclusions. He is too much the demagogue for my taste, liking as much to degrade as to disagree with his adversaries. This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require ""attitude."" In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien. This book doesn't belong on the shelf with Henry Mencken, who wickedly and hilariously debunked quacks. Pass on this and buy ""The Vintage Mencken"" to read his evisceration of chiropractic."
1,Shameful,"The author is funded by the big industries which explains the selection of certain topics and the huge bias it reflects. No matter how many good reviews and bibliographic citations appear here, the ideas expressed reflect corporate interests and not scientific knowledge. Always look at the source!! Research very well where this people's funds come from and that will tell you a little bit more about the real issues."
4,Good Book,I used this book as a supplement to my statistics and QA courses. The book is pretty well written and points out some great examples of the misuse of statistics.
2,Shows fans are starving for Kate Bush recognition,"I am a big fan of Kate Bush. I have collected all of her music, including her cameo appearances on other groups; yet I cannot agree with the other reviewers regarding this CD.The only good thing about this album is that most of the artists did indeed attempt to render original, different versions of Kate Bush's wonderful songs. However, I find their talent a little limited.Listening to this album made me a little sad, as it made me wish that a real tribute album to Kate Bush were released, with versions by artists such as Peter Gabriel, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Tori Amos, etc...The fact that this album was highly rated by other reviewers shows how desperate fans are for more recognition of the talent, uniqueness, and influential nature of Kate Bush's music (especially on some rather popular female artists that followed her)."
2,"""Desperately seeking..Kate""","Well at first when I purchased this album I was so full of hope, curiosity and impatience, because I admit I am starving for some new work of Kate Bush--hint, hint)and I know I am not alone on this one. Anyhow, I listened to it again, and again, and I realized that this is unfortunately not it. I really liked the remake of ""Suspended in Gaffa"" that was my favorite, very original (that's why the record is not 1 star), but then I quickly skipped to listen to the classic ""Running up that hill"" and...I cried, I am sorry but the remake was well below average. I agree with another reviewer who expressed the wish of having high profile artists performing Kate's awesome art, I am surprised why they haven't done it so far...However no offense to the artists who did take up on the challenge of performing Kate's songs, more power to them, however I wish they came up with something better."
2,an offbeat non-standard method of casting,"I would not buy this again - it teaches a non-standard supposedly ""new"" methof of casting"
4,Protection Advice,"All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction."
2,Maybe good for beginners,"Paxton Quigley's book is a compliation of parts of other books on firearms self protection. It's a bit overdone, and probably would scare the average woman thinking about protecting herself. Women seem to have special problems protecting themselves. They usually do not want to hurt anyone, and they will do all most anything for a baby or a family member before they will do anything to protect themselves. However, women that are able to continue to practice with a hand gun, usually become quite proficent. They know that they don't know, and they listen to instructions. Most men think they know it all already."
1,Not Quite A Piano Book,"I was looking for a piano songbook for childern to play on a piano. I should have realized it was not just the songbook from the price. It comes with an electronic toy piano. The songbook is play by numbers and this did nothing for somebody that is learning to play piano. Very disappointing. Age level is pre-school, before able to read."
5,A powerful anti-war film.,"This is not only a spectacular and stunning piece of film making, it is a powerful anti-war film. If you can watch this film today and not be haunted and disturbed by it, you are not paying attention. I watched it recently for the first time in over 20 years and came away shaken. I can't help but wonder if it is not on DVD because there are people who do not want this film to be widely available. As it is now, you have to dig for it. If more people watched this film they might be asking questions our ""leaders"" would rather have left unasked. If you have not seen this film, or it has been a number of years since you saw it last, I can recommend it. It is not an overt anti-war film with an explicit anti-war message, but after seeing it, you will not view world events with the same eyes you did before, I promise."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS AND FILM,"DAVID LEAN COULD HAVE DIRECTED ALMOST ANY FILM HE WANTED AT THIS TIME IN HIS CAREER, AND HE CHOSE THIS PROVOCATIVE AND EMOTIONAL STORY OF A LITTLE TOWN IN IRELAND. THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER OF HIS, INCLUDING THE EARLY ONES. THE CASTING IS SUPERB, COULD NOT BE BETTER RIGHT DOWN TO THE SMALL ROLES LIKE MAUREEN. I SAW IT WHEN I WAS 13 WITH MY PARENTS WHO WERE LEAN FANS. ITS HIS BEST FILM, TREATED BY SOME AS HIS WORST FILM. I EXPECTED TO SEE ALEC GUINESS IN IT, BUT THERE IS NO REAL ROLE FOR HIM. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PEOPLES LIVES IN THE FILM IS AMAZING AND I THINK AHEAD OF ITS TIME FOR 1970 FILM VIEWERS."
2,Ryan's Revenge,"A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean."
2,Lean Pickin's,"Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless."
2,Irish movie,The lead actress does a poor job of acting.Was recently in Ireland and stopped at the location of this film.
1,customers beware,"When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting a good deal because of the cheaper price. However, once I received it, I knew I had made a mistake. I've been using this product for several years now, and I knew just by looking at this one that it wasn't right. The texture was incredibly thin, and the color was much lighter -- something that could only leave me to believe that maybe water had been added to it.Lesson learned -- spend the extra money -- you're paying for quality!"
5,Great Beginner Camera,"We had used a decent quality camcorder before our son bought this one. This one has been a pleasant surprise. Although the picture quality might be more like 4 stars, the features that are provided at such a low cost make this a 5 star product. It has all the fundamentals for a beginner and it fits well in medium size and small size hands (unlike some that require two hands or very large hands or cost five times as much for a small form-factor). We had it out of the box in minutes and were recording first videos with it in less than 15 minutes. The price makes it affordable for school kids to have all kinds of fun projects with it."
2,Samsung 8mm video camera,The on/off switch is stuck. I cannot therefore record or review tapes. I pried the switch and made a temporary contact and confirmed that the camera can record and play-back I would like to be able to return it for full credit or have it repaired.
4,Very pleased with this camcorder,I just purchased this camcorder used for only $80. It is a great camera for the price. It's easy to use and the picture is good in quality. I bought it as a gift for my son (age 7) and he can handle it well on his own.
2,it sounds great!~!~!~!~!,it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
1,Stopped working after 6 months,"Bought this item in July and it stopped working in December. Specficially, the playback function stopped working."
1,Not worth it!,"This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
3,Just fits by budget,"It was the right match for me for price-features balanced.I brough this to use it in India, the AC datapter can take in 230v/60hz and thats wonderful. The PAL feature is the one i was looking for. Its smal land compact and that makes this very handy. The Title feature provided , were you can select a title for your recodings from the list.Overall this was the best price i could get.May be two years from now, i m planning to dispose this and buy MiniDV which would cost much less than what it is now.so Untill then..SCL700 is all that i can envy about."
1,"Awkward controls, below-par reliability","Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers."
5,YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU BOUGHT THIS!!!,"This album is proof that Jason Robert Brown is a musician's musician, and that he has mastered many different forms of popular music. Each of these 11 songs could stand on their own as a brilliant song, and none of these have the same style or feel as another.Brown's pure talent shines through this album, and there are several moments that are just so beautiful that I just get chills listening to them. Every lyric and harmony has been precisely placed, and the music always fits the idea of the song very naturally. There are some amazing performance moments on this album; Brown is an incredible pianist and singer in addition to his composing and arranging talents.This is probably the album that I listen to more than any other, and I would recommend it to anyone. It is packed with amazing musicality.Don't listen to this while trying to get work done; these songs will steal your attention and keep it for the whole duration of the CD."
2,OK,I really like songs for a new world and the last 5 years. was excited to purchase this disc but was kinda disappointed. lacks the edgy variation and creativity of the others. not bad and the cover track is fun--just not up to the success of the other jason robert brown work.
4,excellent resource,I am fortunate enough to have Lake Douglas as an instructor. He has forgotten more about landscape architecture than most people will ever know. I love going to his class because he has a genuine passion for the subject and almost limitless knowledge. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed.
4,Great Fidelity 1956 1957 Swing From Basie and Williams.,"What we have here is the crack ""April In Paris"" era Basie band with one Ella F track singing with Joe Williams on ""Too Close To Comfort"", a bunch of tracks with Joe taking the lead and a few great swinging instrumentals and a few alternative sides.The whole album works well, great sound,exciting music,especially if you like the croon of Joe Williams.The famous ""Joe Williams sings CD"" with Basie is considered the better,no arguing that fact, but this CD is a nice addition to your library.Great blowing on the 3 versions of One'O'clock Jump here make it all worthwhile."
3,"A good Count Basie record, but not an Ella record!","This is a perfectly fine, swinging Count Basie record with some great Joe Williams vocals. It just annoys the heck out of me that Ella sings a duet with Williams on only one track of 13 and she gets top billing. It is a great version of ""Too Close For Comfort"". The disk also includes Joe Williams classic version of ""Smack Dab in the Middle"". Docked one star for annoying marketing."
3,This shouldn't be labeled an Ella album.,"It's a good album, and I'd give it more stars if I hadn't thought I was purchasing an Ella Fitzgerald album. It was quite a disappointment to put the CD in my player and hear Ella's beautiful voice on so few tracks. Joe Williams is good, but he sounds nothing like Ella. This album should be refiled under Basie or Williams!"
3,Good for beginners,"I purchased this audio book for my husband whose game is well beyond the skill level addressed in this book. He told me this book would probably be good for players hoping to break 90, who need help with developing the proper golf swing."
1,Good print quality - bad mechanism,"I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one."
3,Good Printer. . .but not without its faults,"I've used an HP DeskJet 990CSE as my main home office printer for over a year now. Print quality has been consistently good and I have no complaints. It doesn't print color transparencies particularly well, but I've never really expected it to, preferring, instead, to use a color laser for that stuff. I don't use the much-maligned duplexer. However, the single envelope feeder is extremely temperamental and jams frequently. I'd estimate that for every ten envelopes that I print, 3-4 jam, and some jams necessitate my opening the lid and prying the mangled envelope out. Other than the envelope path, I'm generally pleased with this printer."
4,Worked like a charm,My garage door was not working for 4 months.And did some research and bought this product.Right away the garage door started working great.
5,RPM Sensor Assembly,Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast
1,Envelope Feeder Never Worked,"I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one."
2,Recipe for grief,"Until this product, I was a huge promoter of HP printers, but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility. Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX. I'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they don't work and/or freeze up my entire computer. Because of this printer I've cleaned off my entire hard drive, lost valuable files and programs, and still wound up with a non-functional machine. It's been in my closet for 6 months, and I'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer."
5,Easy For Me To Use,"This is a good,inexpensive printer.It is easy for me,stillvery gadget illiterate,to install and use."
1,Hate This Printer! Annoying messages to reset it !!!,"I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the ""arms"" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the ""yellow box marked !"" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!"
3,Its alright...,"But not as good as Slo Burn or Unida (John Garcia's current band.) The music is pretty boring and the vocals are the only thing that redeems this album. Garcia's vocals are improving since the demise of Kyuss and you can tell by listening to this CD as well as material released by the aforementioned groups. ""Motherload"" is a good midpaced song with some cool riffs but it doesn't push the envelope. Only a suggestion for the die hard John Garcia fans."
2,Grindhouse?,I guess I'm not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud.
5,Perfect choice,"This CD is really awesome...the style of their songs are not exactly trance, not euro dance/trance either...they have their own way of playin their songs...AWESOME CHOICE"
1,Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars,"This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me."
1,Can't Believe This Was Even Published,"Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
5,A wonderful helping of Brazilian jazz!,"This is a great CD from an extraordinary jazz saxophone player and probably the biggest name in Brazilian jazz today. We got a chance to see Leo Gandelman perform a lot of these songs at the Blue Note in June. Maracatu is a superb song...his son played it alongside him that night, it was one of the best experiences of live music I've ever heard. If you are into this type of jazz, this is a ""must have"" collection."
2,"The ultimate ""touchy-feely"" book.","This book contains such advise as writing down personal affirmations which you will repeat to yourself at the beginning of each day:I am calm, prepared, and entertaining.I am fit and beautiful.I am humble, patient, and compassionate.I am enough, just the way I am.If this kind of advise is your cup of tea, then this is your kind of book."
2,I was better off with Alexandra Stoddard....,"Very much like Alexandra Stoddard's books, too much alike. Stoddard's books are less wordy and still get to the point. I stopped reading this book when the similarities became clear, been there done that. If you are looking for something in the ""guidance"" area, try Stoddard. She has many better books. I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the ""gems"" I forgot about."
4,A beautifully illustrated edition of this famous tale.,"This new translation of the ""fairy"" story first presented by Charles Perrault (1628-1703) in his Tales of Mother Goose in 1697 was illustrated by Fred Marcellino and translated by Malcolm Arthur. It was a 1991 Caldecott Honor book (that is, a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children. The youngest son of a recently deceased miller receives a cat as his inheritance. He feels that he will soon die of starvation (after he has eaten the cat) since he has no other possessions. But, the cat convinces him to get him boots. The cat proceeds to find a fortune and a position for his young master."
1,too small to read,"My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-("
4,Illustrations!!!,"*** The strength of this book are the exquitely beautiful illustrations. Fred Marcellino, illustrator, is an artist extratorinare, for children's books. Another of his beloved children's books is ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier,"" which has a wonderful story! I highly recommend ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier,"" illustrated by Marcellino, with 5 stars!!!"
1,Not what I expected,"I purchased this for my granddaughter, we love reading together. The print was WAY to small and no way to make it bigger."
3,Not easy to read,"I purchased this story to read to my grandchildren over Thanksgiving. The drawings are delightful, but the text is hard to read (at least on my iPad). The text is supposed to become larger when you touch the screen, but it does not always work. It did for about half the book, then it just stopped. Frustrating!"
3,Free SF Reader,"The story of a guy that is down on his luck and broke, and all he has is a cat. Lucky for him, as this cat turns out to be rather clever. It guides him to an improvement in his station, once he realises it has intelligence.They end up dealing with royalty, ogres, and other entertaining situations."
3,wrong product picture,These are not red and blue color coded like the picture shows. They dont even have black and red like most fiber patch cables. They are uncolored so you get to trace the length of the cable to figure out which is xmit and which is receive. Aggravating.
5,EXTREMELY RARE AND HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER!,Unfortunately this one won't be on cd anytime soon. A bargain at $2400 for the cassette. So rare its worth it. You won't find it anytime soon! If you make an offer you might be lucky and get it for less.
2,Boring,"Gorecki, as usual, is striving for profound angst, but for the most part this Quartet just comes across as boring. The second and fifth movements are terrible. The first movement develops some tense themes that Gorecki could have explored further, but he drops them midway to revert back to his usual droning. The third and fourth movements are the only ones with character, with the latter developing a decent amount of bittersweet sadness."
5,Deceptively good,"Just to be clear: the album is uniformly quiet and just consists of electric guitar without lots of special effects except long sustain. The genius of the record is that MazzaCane can bring out so much with minute details -- muffled string noises, minute pitch changes, perfect arhythmic timing of notes. Don't mistake apparent simplicity for emptiness, as another reviewer did. One of the most moving records I've heard, with a rare, sad, clear quality. I'd recommend this as a first album by this artist (he calls it his best too)."
3,"Marilyn Manson,The Early Years.",Marilyn Manson - The Early YearsNot what I expected. Kind of boring.Not long enough.Go see his concerts instead.
3,Book Review,"This is a most interesting, well thought out book. It give good, concise details of 9/11 events. However I think it lacked depth and could have been more detailed about what is next in terms of Port Security. More emphasis neede to be placed on this area. Worth the money, overall I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend theis book"
3,Very Basic. Good Summary,The book has a very basic and elementary level. Probably this is due to the great array of topics it includes. It is a very high level overview of risk management concepts. Good reading for the weekend.
3,Great for the novice Risk Manager,"If you are a budding Risk Manager/ Officer or are considering a career move towards Risk Management, this book is a good high-level illustration of what the major sleeves of Risk Management has to offer.For the experienced risk professional, this is a bit too fundamental."
4,"Hard-Hitting, Witty and Astute","The introductory essay alone makes this book worthwhile -- the editor traces Lasch's evolution as a historian, and shows how his interest in plain writing evolved along with his political thinking. The examples in the text are both entertaining and informative, and the writing advice is excellent. A good resource people who care about how writing and thinking impact our society."
2,"I appreciate what he attempted, but...","I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds. It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues. Perhaps to someone researching Lasch himself (who was, admittedly, a renown academic) this material would be interesting, but it isn't in the context of language reference."
1,Unable to install,"My title says it all.I am running Windows XP with all service packs. AMD Athlon 64X2,4 GB Ram 2 hard drives, tons of free space."
4,"Decent, Easy Programability, Lost Points for Durability","I guess it is a tribute that I am buying another one of these. I have had this unit for 7 years and it has been slowly dying for a few months. The weakness is the pushbuttons and slide switches that wear out. The real plus to this unit is the interface which is a lot easier and quicker than the almost entirely menu-driven units which take time to change. This one is quick for guests to figure out too. So the ""hard"" buttons are both a strength and weakness. Overall though, a nice thermostat which you may have to replace in a few years--unless the manufacturer has made any changes in it since I bought my original one."
4,Could be even better,All good. The only wish I have is that the batteries could be replaced without taking off the whole thing.
5,LUX Programmable Thermostat.,"Easy to setup. Looks good, great price. Shopped around a bit and this value is second to none. I have only had it for a month or so and good so far."
2,All 3 with unusable LCD screens at night,"We have 3 of these Lux systems in our sprawling house. All 3 have in a few short years had the LCD screens become unusable at night with the incorporated light. The programming part works well enough, The LCD is ok in a well-lit area, but we need to use a flashlight every time we want to adjust them. Not surprisingly, we adjust them less often. It is very frustrating and seriously compromises and otherwise good product."
5,great product,Works well and easy to program. Has definitely decreased our heating bills. Price of product was also very good. Would buy again
5,Favguti is excellent !!,"In an age of the internet GUI store fronts, the typical on-line stores may forget the importance of quality in F2F interaction with the customer. In this regards, FAVGUTI exceeds all expectations on customer satisfaction!The product ordered opposed to product recieved was incorrect (...it happens), to final product quality / reliability was addressed daily till mutually satisfied. Need more on-line stores like FAVGUTI !!--Michael (in San Diego)"
2,Irrelevant for some state & women,"I found this book almost entirely irrelevant and in sore need of update. Nowadays, many states have ""no fault"" divorce (e.g., Colorado), the men's movement has changed culture, and MANY women are career women who are the main bread-winners of the family. This book takes NONE of that effectively into account. Therefore, the book was a total waste of money and time for me. I do not recommend it for any career woman and dedicated mother who is the bread-winner and in a position to need to pay maintenance, lose significant assets, AND lose parenting time despite being BOTH primary parent and primary breadwinner. This book needs to catch up with the times."
4,When you're feeling lost. . .,"I didn't know where to even begin the divorce/custody process, but this book gave me the confidence to make the first appointment with the lawyer. It helped me not feel like such a ""victim"" and I felt much more knowledgeable and prepared. I didn't feel so much like I was at risk for being ""led by the nose"" by my lawyer, and it was indispensable in helping me stand up to the tactics of my husband. Everyone woman in a divorce situation should read this, especially those with children."
1,What a pity,"What a pity that a book about a part of India that has received little attention turns out to be so poorly written. A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this."" The author comes across as a naive young woman who did not even know to take toilet paper to a remote part of India and patently she (and her travelling companions) had done little (if any) reading about the history and politics of Assam. This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book."
4,REAL GOSPEL,"THIS IS THE REAL GOSPEL MUSICTHIS IS WERE IT ALL BEGIN, WHEN GOSPEL MUSICSOUNDED LIKE IT WAS IN CHURCH AND NOT THE CLUBTHIS IS THAT OLD TIME RELIGION ITS GOOD ENOUGHFOR ME"
1,Don't waste your time,"I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money."
3,Okay . . . .,"I got totally hooked by the first song Tubthumping. I still love that song and break out dancing basically whenever I hear it. Amnesia is an incredible song about a subject I'd never think of. However, as the track numbers got higher, the quality got lower and lower. I like this CD, don't get me wrong, I just think I could have profited by buying the singles instead of the CD."
4,Driving rhythms and biting lyrics make Jack a happy boy. . .,"When I first heard of this group in Canada, just before their US release, I didn't know what to think. Here was a band of Anarchists, how good could they be? Apparently, very good. I was impressed when I heard the first track with their simple, memorable lyrics that could get a crowd on the floor dancing and singing, and I like Amnesia even more, with it's more otherworldly quality of being just left of center. Their musical style isn't stuck in just one genre, so they are more free to experiment with words and rhythms and to do more diverse things musically without all of us going crazy trying to keep up. All in all a very worthwhile endeavor, definitely a must get."
2,Not worth the money!,This c.d. is definitly not what you are expecting. Some of the songs have like 3 different words fpr like five minutes. I definitly don't recomend it.
3,"Anarchists Wanna Dance, Too","Chumbawamba (whose name does NOT mean ""one hit wonder"" in Swahili) manage to get with the times (or maybe the times caught up with them?) on this album. While ""Tubthumping"" was a deserved hit, ""Amnesia"" probably should've been as well. Nothing on this album is flat-out bad, but several lines don't sing very well, and it's often difficult to tell exactly what's being espoused. Of course, if you just like the driving beat and musical arrangements, forget all that, toss it on and dance around."
3,Some good songs,"This CD, as far as my personal faves goes, probably gets a 7 out of a 10. This is because, personally, I don't much dig this type of music. Pending my bias, I think that if you like Chumbawumba's 'Tupthumping', you'll like this. Some of the songs on this CD have the ability to get me psyched up and energetic, and I'm practically anemic. 'Mary, Mary' was featured at the beginning of the hit new Patricia Arquette flick, 'Stigmata'. All in all, Chumbawumba's stuff is original and, depending on one's mood, easy and fun to listen to. If you pride yourself in being a despondent dysthymic, though, you might fare better with The Verve or James Horner Soundtracks."
3,Where's the liner notes,I'd rather buy the UK version because it has removed (Most) of the liner notes and some lyrics are removed using a bleeping thing
3,The words...,"I can't say that 'Tubthumper' is a bad CD, however, it's not that good CD, neither. I think that Chumbawamba's style is just not my favorite. I find that the tunes are kinda ""patience-challenging"". However... Chumbawamba's lyrics, filled with political and social criticism, are worth the 12 bucks. The lyrics are REALLY good. They deal with politics, with social problems, religion... I enjoy them a lot. And I actually like bands with ideologies (as long they are not nazi or racist, of course!)We should have much more songwriters like Chumbawamba. Not all lyrics should deal with silly topics like love and stuff. And the tunes are not bad. So I recommend this CD. I think it is in fact closer to 4 stars than to 3 stars (but there's not 3 3/4 stars rating).Well, hope this helps. Take care."
2,Actually 1 stars,"This CD sends the wrong message (anarchy), and some of it is just plain bizarre. Trust me, you'll tire of it. Save your money and go buy Barenaked Ladies."
2,The only good song is the first track.,"The only good song is the first track. Unless you can find a single of the first track, save your money. The rest of the CD is trash."
1,The One Star,"The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually, this song blows after you hear it more than 5 times. This cd has only been in my cd player once...That is the day i bought it. If you like wasting money, buy this cd."
5,"The ""goods"" make the ""bads"" look utterly insignificant! A+!","Granted, most of the songs on this album are decent, but not great. However, the four songs that ARE great (Tubthumping, etc.) are so incredible that they literally blow the rest of the songs away! It is worth paying twice the price just to hear one of these amazing four songs!"
5,"HAPPY, SHINY ANARCHY'S NEVER BEEN MORE FUN!","While Chumbawamba's recent musical efforts have left little or no impression on the music scene, their debut album ""TUBTHUMPER"" will remain ""thumping"" to the dance club beat of a different drum. For unexplainable reasons, I find myself coming back to this album time and time again. The music will not let you go. It's enjoyable, entertaining, and fun!""Tubthumping"" is an unrellenting statement of defiance. ""Amnesia""'s persistent guitar riff and catchy trumpets will NOT leave you suffering from ""long term memory loss"". ""The Big Issue"" contains some tatalizing chorale, and a catchy, lyrical tune. ""Mary, Mary"" is probably my favorite questioning the sanctity of Catholicism.Chambawamba may come and go, but let this be known. There was a band with a wierd name from England, whose music was fun to listen to, coherant, and made anarchy seem like fun!God Save ""Tubthumper""!"
4,"Great music, great anarchy","Damn, their still selling this CD? Well, my friend gave it to me a couple years ago. I liked Tubthimping and all, although I wasn't crazy about it. Actually, it's not the only good song on the CD, Amnesia, Drip, The Big Issue, and Scapegoat are all awsome songs, as are most others. Some of the songs never really caught onto me, but most of it is good music. Anarchy rules!"
2,Where's the variety?,"It may have some, but not much. Tubthumping gets boring after listening to it about 5 times. Amnesia is the best, but that song is OK."
5,"Fast and loud, that's how I like it.","Even though Chumbawamba's most popular single in America was Tubthumping, that is my least favorite song on this album. It's way too slow. The rest of the songs are really fast, and have a great beat. If you like music with a beat, you must get this CD! Hey, even better, many of Chumbawamba's songs actually have meaning, for those of you that have a brain. There are a total of 12 songs and about ten mini-songs on the CD"
2,"In the words of Dr. Evil, ""riiiiiiiiiiiigggggghhhhhht""","I'll be the first one to sadly admit, I bought this album only having heard ""Tubthumping"". That was a huge mistake. If you're considering buying this album only because of that, please DON'T! ""Tubthumping"" gets old after a while anyways. The rest of this CD is hardly worth listening to. There are some mediocre songs here and there, but trust me, this is not worth your [money]."
3,tubthumping,"This is the weirdest cd I have ever listened to. I don't know what it's called but it's to make the song longer. That's cool! At the end of ""Amnesia"", you hear a lady come on talking about brains; ""scoop the brains out, blast the brains with water or air..."" The first time I heard it, I thought it was really weird and unusual. I was disgusted by it and changed rthe song. Now I think it's cool. How they put bits and pieces of random stuff in the songs. Cool. They don't do that with all 12 songs. I also like the music in ""Scapegoat."""
1,Icky lyrics!,"Tubthumber was the reason I wanted this cd and I got it. About 1,000,000 times on the radio plus 100 on the cd. Now I can't stand Tubthumper.The lyrics and music keep repeating themselves. All the other songs have bad lyrics that are negative too! This was not the best choice for me."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD!!,This CD is pure crap. The songs are pitiful and shaky. Your money would be better spent on ANYTHING else besides this cd.
1,AAAARRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!,"Minus ""Tubthumping"", listening to this album is equal to putting your head in the frig. and slamming the door! Avoid the hype. Not even good dance music."
1,Blech!,"I used to not be a fan of modern music - this Cd almost turned me off modern music completely (it was a gift from a friend.) There is one good song on it: ""Tubthumping"" (I didn't know that was the name; I thought the name was ""I get Knocked Down."") Anyhow, that is the only good song. The rest are bad (except for ""good ship lifestyle,"" which is okay.) The good part about the Cd is if I turn it on, my sisters step out of my room almost instantly. So, if you're looking for a way to disturb the peace, this is it."
1,"uhm, why was this popular?","Is there anything less than one star? This might be the worst CD I have ever listened to. One of my friends bought it used, shortly after it came out. Note that fact for future reference: if it just came out, and people are already selling it used, it SUCKED. The lyrics are positively nonsensical, and there is nothing creative or interesting in the instrumentation, melodies, etc. There's one song where all they say is ""drip drip drip goes the water."" What the heck is that supposed to mean? More like, drip, drip, drip melts the plastic, since I left this in the trunk of my car."
3,topper,"These work very well if the item is exactally the same size. If what you are covering is smaller it just sits on top, if bigger it doesn't streatch enough"
4,Easy and reliable,I have had this printer for approximately four years and have had absolutely NO problems with it. It is dependable and reliable. Very efficient. I would recommend it!
2,Not recommended,"We have had this printer about 3 weeks and the cartridge already needs replaced. We do not do an excessive amount of printing, so I think that is a little too soon to run out of ink.Also this printer jams up very easily (one of the reasons I was replacing the last HP printer I had) I feel I have spent as much time fixing paper jams as I have printing. It is easy to fix when it does jam up, but a little frustrating that it happens so often.The print quality is good (just make sure you have the paper settings set correctly to the type of paper you are using!) and it does print quietly and is easy to operate. But overall I would not recommend it."
1,Not a very good printer,"Lasted six months. Never worked exactly right since I purchased it. I think it had software driver problems. Would work sporadically, then lock up and paper have to be cleared manually. Final straw, no matter what type paper it was fed, it would catch in the feed path underneath the print head for no apparent reason. Of course the paper still keeps trying to feed, so the machine just wads it into a mess. In addition to the software driver problem, I think it has a significant design problem with the paper feed as it often trys to feed up to five or six sheets at once, even the HP desk jet paper designed for such printers. I will say that when it did work, it printed well."
2,Limited life span,"My 940C lasted five years, but ate up its paper drive mechanism yesterday.The prints were very good, although color quality was sometimes off.Hard to complain when it came free with the Mac, but it is a slow printer and with amulti-color ink cartridge, somewhat more expensive than a printer using more individual cartridges.Always had minor paper feeding glitches."
1,NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER!!,I spent over 2 1/2 hrs. (after 1 hr. myself) on the phone with HP trying to install this printer. It never would work right. The HP tech said there is a problem in the software program of this printer. This HP DESKJET 940C is everyone's worst installation nightmare!
4,Excellent! I just ordered another one!,"Printer was exactly as I expected, practically new condition and worked perfectly. It was shipped quickly and I am very satisfied. In fact, I just ordered another from Solar. I think it was the last refurbished one they had. Sorry."
2,Don't Go There,"Despite the great rating and rave reviews, I curse the day I brought this one home. I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer--not because I am so productive, but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject. Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in ""that's a common problem. The arm doesn't detract after each page. You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens."" So far, that means 6-8 times per day. No more HP for me! This is my second bad experience. You would think I would have learned by now."
2,Buyer Beware,"I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects. The printer shredded 40% of the print jobs I sent. The roller jams the paper in back, forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster. It is like playing toy-tug with my dog. If it does not eat your print jobs, then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast. I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership"
3,"Overall, a B+","I've had the 940c for a couple of years and use it at my work. I print 20 to 30 documents a day, mostly b&w; but some color also.Overall this is a good printer and does its job nicely. What this printer lacks in features it makes up for in ease of use and consistency. Rarely have I ever had a paper jam but when I have it's easy to resolve."
3,"Got problems, but its a good printer","I got this after my OLD hp printer finally died. The quality is good, but it is extremely slow. Took 2 hours to print a screenshot from Unreal 2 at best quality. Its possibly because I'm using the parallel port, not the USB. As the printer DID NOT come with a USB cable. Also, NEVER USE THE CANCEL BUTTON ON IT!!!! It sends a strange message to the comp. which the computer sends back to the printer and tells it to print from 20-80 pages of JIBBERISH. Also it is a MEMORY HOG ON YOUR PC!!! I HAD TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO FOR 2 HOURS!! But i must admit, the quality is excellent. On the included sample of photo quality paper, it looks fantastic.So if you buy this printer, buy a USB cable and have a lot of memory. Also if you set it to the max resoultion for printing, it requires 400 mb. of extra hard drive space.So the choice is yours. If you buy it and don't like it, don't say i didn't warn you..."
5,So far sooooooo good,"I bought this printer two weeks ago and had it up and running within minutes of unpacking. When I first bought this PC I feared the two most commonly documented problems,paper jams and printer driver problems/OS problems, but to date I have not experienced either and the quality is as good as the laser printers I use in the office. The only thing I dislike about this printer is the high cost of replacement cartridges so I am hoping someone will deveolpe a refill kit similiar to the one I used with my old Canon BJC 250, which worked great..."
3,Good Printer,"This printer lasted more then 2 years. Perfect prtints, and not a ink hog. But we bought cheaper ink and it caused the ink to drip or drag from the paper to the rollers of the printer. So if you do buy, make sure you only use HP ink. Dont listen to the sales guy at Frys like we did!!!!!"
2,It worked fine until I bought a new computer,"I owned this printer for more than a year. It worked fine until I bought a new computer, I unplugged it, moved to a new place, and replugged it. The power supply burnt out. The printer was dead. I wasted 2 packs of unused expensive ink cartridges."
1,A poor use of my money,"I bought a new laptop and wanted a new printer. This wone came highly recommended from the story. It worked great for three months (of course, the length of the warranty). It now only states ""paper jam"" and after hours of time on the phone and with the hints on the web, I am going out to buy a new printer - I would certainly not buy this one, again."
2,"Loved it, then it left me...","This is the 3rd HP printer I have owned and it has broken the fastest. My first one was around for four years of college, then it died. The second, an 820 Cse lasted about 18 months. The 940c lasted me just over a year and died. Add to this the fact that the cartridges are expensive (I'm stuck with 6 of them) and don't last terribly long.I'm thinking laser to replace this one, and a Canon inkjet for color printing."
2,HP 940C,"After using this printer for one year (home use), a plastic bracket to which a spring attaches to maintain belt tension on the print cartridge carriage broke. Rather than try to get a new part, I'm going to throw this printer away and buy a new one."
2,I won't buy one again,"I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in ""best"" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!"
1,Bad printer,"Do not buy this printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it- it jams every other time I print, and most of the time, it grabs 3-4 papers at once, and prints on all of them. I certainly expected better quality from HP, and this did not deliver. The printing is decent when it works, which is not often. I will be looking for a different company next time."
2,worked great until it just STOPPED working at all!,"I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out. I thought I was ""movin' up"" by purchasing an HP, well, this one stopped working after 6 months: the printer carriage gets hung up on the right. I went to the website for troubleshooting options, none of which solved the problem....and the warranty is the biggest weakness...90-days! This alone speaks poorly of the expectations HP has of its own products. EPSON's warranty was 1 YEAR, but I had misplaced the receipt. SO, perhaps EPSON is a better deal, as long as you KEEP THE RECEIPT!"
4,Decent Inkjet,"I've had the HP940c for a year now with no problems. The printer installed via USB under Windows XP without a hitch. Photos and text are good quality. I have used multiple pages/page printing and manual duplexing without any hicups. No jams to date. Replacement of catridges is easy. Low cartrides are noted by a dialog box popping up and by lifting the lid to the catridges to see where the cartridges line up with the icons inside the printer. Replacement catridges are expensive, but this printer scored well vs other inkjets in cost/page on PC Magazine's review. I use a HP Laserjet 1200 for volume printing where color is not critical. Good bang for the buck. To get 5 stars, the printer would need to be faster, hold more paper and cost less for cartridge replacement. You just won't get that at this price range."
4,Shadow in the Glass,"It is always a pleasant suprise when a new author appears on the fantasy scene with a book that should keep them there for a long time. Shadow in the Glass has a great blend of magic and adventure, which has nicely set up the series for the next three books."
2,Curved Thomas the Train tracks,"Again, a good product, but over priced. I would try to find some gently used ones."
3,"Kinda dull rock, but part of my first exposure to Schweisser","I picked this up (and 'Autobahn zur Holle') based on some reviews that made them sound like a German AC/DC or perhaps, even better: 'Megaherz'. The album opens with the title track 'Heiland' which is probably my favorite. Track one has the meter and aggression of a mid-paced AC/DC tune and appears to be as fast and vigorous as die Schweißer care to play. From there each track is progressively a little mellower than the previous. While I'm sure this album would appeal to someone, it seems that those who like the mellower end of it would probably prefer something by the 'Puhdys', and those looking for something harder would prefer 'Megaherz'."
5,Quilts from the Smithsonian,"I'm a quilt lover, and my favorite are old scrappy quilts. I do alot of quilting myself, but as a result of my love for quilts I also collect quilt books. One of my favorites is this little books from That Patchwork Place, Quilts from the Smithsonian by Mimi DietrichThe book has pictures and patterns of 12 great quilts from the Smithsonian collection, from a simple Plaid Patch to the more complexed Chesapeake Rose, and The Lilies of the Quilters. There are all colored pictures all through the book, and the there are easy to follow directions helping you to make your own quilts for future generations to love. Or if you are not a quilter the book si a perfect coffee table book with all it's colors and inspirations.Britt Arnhild Lindland"
3,Baptists from the days of Jesus to now..,It is the exact thing I was expecting and serves my requirement for research.The book is precise and gives the source for his facts.
1,I will stick with the pink or blue packets...,"Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a ""sandy grit"" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body."
2,Worse than Stevia.,Mild sweeetness - though ultimately tastes like soap - or something reminiscent of soap.
3,Mounting Brackets a Problem,"The description says ""Mounting brackets...are included where applicable"", evidently Edelmann considers the two mounting brackets on this line as re-useable. The OEM brackets are spot-welded together, you cannot remove them from the old line until you drill out the spot weld. I tried a chisel to separate the halves, but that only butchered the bracket. Being a weekend mechanic I was not prepared to have to re-use those brackets. I checked some other stores, none of them included a bracket either. This hose assembly is of good quality, it fit just fine, the price and delivery were great, but I was upset because I was unprepared and not knowledgeable about how to remove and re-use the existing brackets."
4,Great little treasures,We have a colletion of Little Critter books that my 3 older ones have enjoyed since they were little. Now with my 2 younger ones I purchased a few new ones. They sure love them! They're simple books but they are a hit!
5,Your Signature Life by Dianna Booher,"Personal accountability, integrity, character - whatever you label it, it's doing the right thing, even when no one else is watching. ""Your Signature Life"" is a personal-development home run!Through captivating imagery and intriguing statistics, Dianna Booher challenges us to examine our lives to see what kind of character we are developing. Do we reflect light or darkness? She shows us how our experiences and relationships may help to form the way we look at the world, but they do not have to define who we are or who we will become.Although we cannot control the actions of those around us, we are called to control our responses to those actions. Personal accountability is not a thing of the past. We can and must have it today if we ever hope to look back over our lives and smile. Others are watching. God is watching.Ms. Booher's latest release, ""Your Signature Life,"" is a triumph for those seeking to live a life of integrity and total fulfillment."
4,Asimov's early work his best,"The best example around of Asimov's work. It is intellectual, interesting, and just plain entertaining. reading it, you can feel the danger that the fledgeling Foundation is in when threatened by its aggeressive neighbors and there are unconventional solutions. I have only two complaints. The book is dated and there is little action. Get past those and you're sure to enjoy the book."
1,I almost read the whole thing!!!,"50,000 years in the future and they are still smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers, the main power source is nuclear energy..and they carry nuclear guns??? A kid in the 2nd grade has more imagination!I almost made it to the end. It had gotten so absurd that it finally just drifted off to a shelf....What I didn't like:1) Lack of imagination (see above).2) Cardboard characters. Nobody to really cheer for..either the character is a pencil necked geek or some babbling fool.3) False religion mumbo jumbo: never would of worked IF most/allthe priests new it was a farce.Avoid unless you need something to stoke the fire with next winter."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"This has to be one of the worst books i EVER picked up. Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"
1,Waste of time;Stick to Robot novels.,"This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."
2,Melodramatic pulp,"Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices. The book (and its successors) read like an episode of Leave It to Beaver set in outer space. The repetitive vault openings became tediously predictable - I felt like I had read the same chapter a dozen times. Read the Cliff Notes, save yourself some time. *****"
2,"Wonderful book, except for the part with all the words.","The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from ""Foundation"" to ""How Not to Write a Book"" or ""Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English."" I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."
3,Foundation,"The main reason I read sci-fi is to visualize strange new worlds and places. Although a good book, I didn't really get a good mental picture of the different worlds involved in it except Trantor in the very beginning of the book. It was mostly about people and politics with very little of the landscapes they lived in. I guess that is why I liked the Dune and Hyperion series so much."
2,Disappointing,"I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way."
4,"Smart, Sporadically very Engaging","Parts of the book I really enjoyed. I appreciate the twists played by characters on one another. I felt that after reading through the entire bit, though, that not enough had actually taken place. I didn't feel I walked away with a story I could remember. I did read in one review that this was ""serious science fiction,"" so with that in mind, I still give it five stars. I only would have liked that the pace be quicker.I really really enjoyedThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I would recommend that over this book Foundation, based on my personal taste."
4,Classic mind-stretching sci-fi,"This is certainly an excellent ""first"" book in the Asimov series. Even if one has not read, Prelude to Foundation, you can pick up right up and enjoy the series. Sets the stage for the next books in the series, but also makes one think, ""What would happen if America lost its power sources?"""
4,"The first written, and the worst of the series","I started reading this series with the original ""Foundation"" and was very disappointed with it. After all the acclaim it received, I was expecting something truly exceptional. Instead, I got a historical narrative that is closer in style to something you would read in the Brittanica for a school assignment. It is really a kind of ""mutant"" between a novel and a documentary. What's more, it is exceptionally boring. What kept me going was the Asimov name on the cover and the hope of better things to come. This is not to say that it is a really bad book. I must confess that it has some interesting parts and of course, the series as a whole is an absolute classic. Every other novel in the Foundation series is so brilliant, that they cover for this disappointment. It must also be remembered that Asimov wrote this book in the early 50's when he was still a young and inexperienced writer"
3,Romans in Space,"I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk, Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style, I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum, a good book if you can ignore this stuff."
4,"Still good science fiction, even for 1951","Foundation is great science fiction for the scientific minded, no deus ex machina here. The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm, cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills, you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter, every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing, like Hemmingway, there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book, but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots."
1,zzzzzz.....,"I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."
3,Psychohistory Saves Classic,"Re-reading Foundation showed it to be rather dated in its depiction of an advanced galactic empire, rooted in its 1940s science fiction environment. The overall plot, such as it is, betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories, and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire, the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy, is a much better novel, especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However, the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe."
4,A filler,"A trilogy consists of three books so, even although ""Foundation"" (one of the true classics) is good enough to be a trilogy by itself, formally ""Foundation"" needed two more volumes to make up a trilogy. In these two volumes the level does not fall off too badly, although ""the Mule"" is rather weak.Unfortunately Asimov, one of the truly greats of SF, later succumbed to undue pressure and combined his Robot-series (already in itself continued too long) with the Foundation, with outright embarrassing results. The original three books were quite enough, thank you!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The start of Asimov's highly influential groundbreaking future history series. The invention of the science of psychohistory captivated me the first time I read it. Basically, all those with an interest in SF should check this out.Asimov's intro gives some history of the evolution of this series with his editor, Campbell, as well as some entertaining silliness by the publisher Doubleday. He tells how they wouldn't publish him at one time, and later on they are at his door, cap in hand asking for a new book.Foundation : The Psychohistorians - Isaac AsimovFoundation : The Encyclopedists - Isaac AsimovFoundation : The Mayors - Isaac AsimovFoundation : The Traders - Isaac AsimovFoundation : The Merchant Princes - Isaac AsimovFuture prediction equations suggest Galactic Empire go bye-bye.4.5 out of 5Struggles with Seldon's legacy.3 out of 5City split and the odd ship.3.5 out of 5Commercial leading edge.3 out of 5Seldon crisis and sellers of heaps of stuff.3.5 out of 5"
4,Good? You bet. Great? Not sure ...,"I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin."
2,Bor-ring!,"I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme."
2,what masterpiece?,"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."
1,This is a cult book...,"... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it. The characters are flat, the story is contrived, and why are all people of power in this world men? Very realistic idea of the future."
5,Never gets old,"Having just finished Greg Bear's brilliant ""Foundation & Chaos"", I've decided I can no longer wait to begin re-reading the original again. I wish I could take the next few months to start off with the Robot series, move on to the Galactic Empire series, and then finsh with the entire collection of the Foundation books (because it's all one big wunnerful story, doncha' know!). Well, not this year, perhaps, but in a few I may do just that. In the meantime, I will re-read ""Foundation"" with yet another new perspective of Hari Seldon and all that came before this original masterpiece... it truly never gets old."
1,Text to speech disabled = no sale,"I read this book as a teenager and was excited to be reminded of it recently. I went to Amazon to purchase the book to find that it is one without text to speech enabled.I make it my policy not to buy any book that doesn't have this feature as I prefer to read when I'm stationary and listen while I'm driving. Since the future isn't here yet and I can't safely read while I'm driving, this is a problem for me.Listen up publishers. I'm not going to buy your audio book. Disabling this feature just ensures that I'll not buy your ebook either. If I really want to read this book, I'll find a used copy because you've annoyed me that much."
1,No Canadians allowed... WTF!,"Copyright restrictions make it so I cannot get this classic on my kindle... Its a kindle, I should be able to get any book in any language sent to me in any part of the world. I hate you Johnny Copyright!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....Is it over yet?,Count me with the minority who found this book unreadable. It was incredibly dated with imagery very thin and sparse. I got lost in the pointless dialog and was unable to finish.
1,Didn't Believe a Word of It,"I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."
1,One of the worst things I've ever read,"This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse."
3,Be Careful of the Edition,"Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science fiction minds of the twentieth century. He was NOT, however, a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.""Foundation,"" the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series, is a collection of short stories originally published in ""Astounding"" magazine. The first couple are very good, but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven, dialogue is unrealistic, and characters are wooden and one-dimensional. And yet, through Asimov's wonderfully creative idea of psychohistory and its use in saving a dying Galactic Empire, this series became one of the best science fiction stories of all time, and well worth reading.Do be careful which edition you read. I read the Del Ray paperback edition, and I have never seen so many typographical errors in a published book."
5,Tapes were as advertise,"The set arrived on time and enjoyed listening to the tapes, the tapes arrived in good condition and great sound."
5,Foundation,Great book by Isaac Asimov. What a wonderful sci fi book. I'd recommend this series for anyone that likes fiction
5,It Holds up,Not earth shaking or intensely mind bending but even after 30 years I enjoyed rereading the series. Asimov's storytelling is great!
5,Smart. Thought provoking. Classic. Sci-fi at its best!,Asimov was one of the founding fathers of Sci-fi and to him we owe a debt of gratitude for making the genre worthy of the literary title. His messages and considerations give the reader a lot more than just something to kill time. It makes sci-fi an avenue to real soul searching.
5,OUTSTANDING a must read and re-read (by ISAAC ASIMOV),"Any coment's on this serie of books must be a positive one and if it's not then thats becouse you dident understand the story, so you should reread them all again, i stronly recommend this serie of books to anyone, not just sci fans, but to all that have the taste to read. The author of this serie wrote 470 books, he was a genius and died out of his time with the age of 72, in memory of ISAAC ASIMOV i recommend all of his books, but especially the foundation series,thaks for reading my review."
5,The Zenith of Asimov!,"I highly recommend the time to read ""Foundation""...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"
5,great read,"The book doesn't really need yet another enthusiastic review, so I'll keep this to the point.The stories in this book are really enjoyable. You get to learn about characters in the beginning and then spend the rest of the time reading about the legacy they created and the later events that they had a hand in shaping. I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read, the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down."
2,"Confused about ""classic"" status","Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. ""Nuclear"" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!"
1,Piece of crap from crap seller,"I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. What's worse, it's in absolutely terrible shape. The front cover is ripped, the spine has old sticker residue on it, and the back looks like it's been chewed on by a small animal. So much for being ""Used- Very Good Condition"""
4,Good Book,I enjoyed the Foundation. The book is divided into 5 parts. The most interesting of the 5 is the 3rd one. The end is not what i expected. The 5 parts overall are not particularly conected in my opinion. But the book was good.
3,over all a pretty good book,FOundation was not the most enjooyable book i have ever read. My biggest compalaint was the time gap were too big. I think the book went over to long a time. One mintue your on one planet with these charecters and the next chapter everone is dead and its been 50 years
2,"Well, it's Asimov","This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."
3,A classic ... good thing it's short.,"Let's face it: Isaac Asimov was not a very good writer, especially this early in the game. We read 'Foundation' not because we are interested in reading some fantastic literature but because the ideas in this little book became the tropes that have thrived in science fiction even to this day. If you're interested in sci-fi, 'Foundation' is a must-read.The importance of 'Foundation' in the genre may force us to allow for the blandness of its prose; however, it does not excuse it. The characters are ciphers, the style is blunt and ugly, like a sledgehammer, and there are plenty of minor but annoying infelicities of grammar. It's a good thing the novel is pleasantly short; whatever Asimov's faults, long-windedness was not one of them."
3,"A pleasant book for a beginning reader, not much else...","I read this book as a teenager, and loved it. Read it again several years later, and could not understand what it was that I liked. Sure, Asimov writes with ease - and it is equally easy to read. But the characters are totally flat, the plot (?if any) is thoroughly predictable, and he also shows a terrible amount of prejudice against women, minority people and just about anything that does not fit the template of ""middle-age white american male"". The book generally left a bad taste, as if you'd stuffed yourself on marshmallows - mostly air but enough sugar to make you feel sick."
3,just lost interest 3/4 way through,"previous reviewers hit on the my main gripes. no character development or insights. predictable plot development. no women at all. i understand it was written as a series of shorts, but it is really just a political drama played out in space. it could just as easily been set on earth in any era. some interesting moments, but far from gripping.i much preferred early heinlein, clarke, and later ellison, pangborn, farmer, pohl, cordwainer smith, et al.dont think i'll bother with the rest of the series."
2,Dry Sci-Fi,I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this.
3,"Pleasant SF outing, but little more.","Three stars is a bit generous, but this certainly isn't a bad book. In fact, it is easy to read, always interesting, and often exciting. But that's all it is. It is not deep or meaingful. It is not profoud. It is not thought provoking. It isn't even particularly well written. But it's so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching collapse of civilization. This is an interesting enough premise and very original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take seriously.If you come across a copy of this book, read it. It won't take long and you'll probably enjoy much of it even if your not a SF fan, but I don't recommend anyone by this book. There is to much out there that is much much better."
4,Ahead Of His Time.,"The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time."
5,"Excellent, but it now!","I admit it, I am an Asimov-phile. This is yet another book by Asimov that is very hard to put down. I rate this, and all of Asimovs books with the highest regard. Quite simply buy it now, or you are a fool. ;-)"
4,Excellent unless you are looking for Star Wars,This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment.
3,A classic appropriate for scifi newcomers & series lovers,"First, I read quite a bit from all genres, primarily to expand my world. Foundation is a very good series, but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world: 1) you were a statistics/religion/philosophy major in college (it may annoy); 2) you want a book for entertainment, not to ponder (it may bore); 3) you really think character development is important in a book (it spans generations, hence little/no development); 4) You're already a scifi buff (most of the books you've read have already assimilated the ideas of Foundation -- credit where due!). Biggest reason to read: its robust, well-crafted universe. Other tidbits: I've tried to read this series a second time, but it can't sustain my interest quite like other 5-star selections."
5,Always liked Asimov,"I always liked Asimov, but finding series books in sequence is difficult with print books. Kindle makes it easy! Now they're all cataloged in order and I don't even have to get out of bed for the next one.Reading the ""Foundation"" series in order rather than by availability makes a great writer even better."
3,Great Idea amatuer writing,"Foundation is completely a story of ideas, the characters are completely servants to the scifi galaxy Asimov has created. The story is of a galaxy in a situation and not a character in a situation. I think the idea he created was amazing but I prefer stories about characters and because he originally wrote the stories for a magazine and later combined them which destroyed the flow of the storyRich"
3,"Good, but not the best","I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever. It was good, but not that great. Maybe in the 1950's it was the best of sci-fi, but compared to today's standards it was a little boring and out of date. It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future. There's not a lot of action but I have to admit the dialog is pretty good. If you're into nostalgia, politics and interesting dialog this book is for you."
5,Best Book by Asimov (fiction),"I have read almost all of Asimov's fiction, and this book is by far one of the best. I would recommend it to anyone interested!Boom, Done.-Jeremy Paul Gallagher"
5,One of the best ever,"This book it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever written. It should be on the ""must read"" list for any sci-fi fan."
2,Don't Bother,"Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However, you should stop there. Foundation is bad. This book is totally predictable. Read DUNE if you want something intelligent and entertaining. Read FOUNDATION if you want something that you probably won't even finish."
5,Wonderful,"What can I say??? Asimov at his best. It's impossible to stop reading this book. The chapters are so incredible, that you can't wait to get to the finish to know how the plot ends. If you haven't read it, you don't know what you are missing"
5,Cornerstone of Science Fiction,"Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best, this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival, for this planet, Terminus, holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it."
3,"Good, but not as good as Foundation","Foundation and Empire is basically a continuation of Foundation. There really isn't a new plot, just new problems for the Foundation to deal with. Foundation and Empire is pretty good, but without the novelty of the new ideas presented in Foundation, it is a bit flat. About the only reason I could think of to recommend this book is so you can see what else happens to Seldon's colony."
1,Still hasn`t arrived after two months,The book was apparently resent after not arriving 5 weeks after ordering and it still hasnt arrived after two months. phshopus customer service has been responsive but there is something going wrong with the shipment process
4,Foundational series!,"If this series seems a little dated and naive now, try to cut yourself back to when it was read! I appreciated the imaginative leaps, as well as the way the whole series observes the discipline of the genre -- make one fundamental alteration to science as we know it, and then see where the thread leads you."
5,Classic science fiction,"I remember walking to the library as a thirteen year old with my back pack, smile on my face between each of the foundation books. Now, I have read them over again (a few times) and the only difference is that I now own them so no more walks to the library."
4,Foundation Series,"It was a very interesting concept, a bit heavy on a scientific version of ""fate"". This series of books uses the concept of random motion as a prediction for the future was quite a brilliant idea. The story deals with a genius who predicts behavior for millenia into the future and actually has recorded holograms for future people that deal with his predictions. Where I had trouble was the reliance on robots in the later books. I personally prefer the human side of things. It was an interesting read and well worth it."
3,"Classic but drifting, give it a second chance","In my initial read of this book, I stuck with it because it is a classic and everyone loves it. However, after about half of the book I got bored, nothing seemed to be building or catching, so I stopped. I have restarted and am more interested now because I know some more of the background story. So far, the second trip through this book is much more enjoyable than my first slow trip."
2,tough going,"I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"
3,The Softest of Soft Sci Fi,"I read this* because it presents a galaxy without aliens, colonized by people. It was soft SF in so many ways (incl. FTL, antigravity, flying cars, walnut-sized nuclear reactors, laser pistols, personal and city force shields, egregious use of energy in the form of anti-gravity elevators) and the psychohistorian-predicts-future-events-to-the-day plot was dumb--not to mention the idea of civilizations with FTL ships incapable of harnessing nuclear power. With repeated suspensions of disbelief, it was pleasant enough. The characters were not such nitwits as those of ""Prelude to Fdn."" No need to read his other books.* after reading If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens...Where is Everybody?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life (2002) by Stephen Webb"
2,letdown after the first book,I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book. The two stories lacked charters that I cared about and unlike the first foundation book their was very little to contemplate. Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page.
3,"A good story, but somewhat weak on characters","This may be a classic and I may be a science fiction fan, but read Asimov's ""The Gods Themselves"" instead of this. His later work is definitely better. ""Foundation and Empire"" is like its predecessor (""Foundation"") in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff, but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading, ""Why am I reading this?"" I'll read the last in the trilogy (""Second Foundation""), but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi, read ""Hyperion,"" ""Fall of Hyperion,"" ""Ender's Game,"" ""Childhood's End"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.""For good sci-fi, read ""More Than Human,"" ""The Gods Themselves,"" ""Slan,"" ""The Demolished Man,"" ""The Stars My Destination.""TOO MUCH TO LIST, MY FRIENDS!!!Good luck and good reading."
4,Department of Morbid Details,"In a twisted (mis)reading of the Foundation series, the Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo used Asimov's epic as a prophecy of upcoming apocalypse and converted dimsighted guru-dictator Shoko Ashara into an incarnation of Hari Seldon. Worthwhile to sharpen your wits as you read the story to see how the zealots got it wrong -- but also how they could easily pervert Asimov's points. (See David Kaplan and Andrew Marshall's book, ""The Cult at the End of the World."")"
4,Foundation By Isaac Asimov,"I always enjoy reading Isaac Asimov's writing, and foundation was no exception. The plot is imaginative and original, like much of Asimov's writing. Foundation is set in the future, a time when our galaxy is ruled by a failing empire. Hari seldon, a psychologist, must prevent the galaxy from falling into anarchy and barbarism by creating a foundation of scientists. Foundation is fun to read, and provides ample entertainment. I recommend reading it."
2,Just not my kind of book - Others liked it.,"It isn't my kind of book but, I thought, I would give it a try. We read it in our book club. Some of the readers liked it, most of them didn't. I didn't. But, the author did have great insight to the future in the 1950 - 1960's"
1,A very bad book,"...To my surprise and disappointment, I found ""Foundation"" to be an exceptionally terrible ""book"", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged ""novel"" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ..."
1,"An Example of What is ""Classically"" Wrong with SciFi.","I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."
1,Do not buy this HP 960 printer from ANTonline,"This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon. After paying the advertized price of $61.97 plus $22.82 shipping and handling charge, they sent and delivered you a 6 oz size bubble wrapped pack Innovera Solid ink sticks/cartridge.No invoice or phone number in the package!"
3,color ink cartridge,"I've had this printer for about a year. About every 3 months I need to change the color ink cartridge when I don't even use it. I've called support and they didn't help me at all. I changed the black ink and when I print something, nothing comes out on the paper. On the printer it shows 3 circles on top and 4 on the bottom. I can't keep buying color ink cartriges every 3 months. What do I need to do?"

3,"Ne Ver, Ne Boisia...","I love t.A.T.u and I have done several t.A.T.u reviews.I bought this CD merely for the fact I loved Ne Ver, Ne Boisia from the Eurovision.Not Gonna Get Us (Radio Edit) was okay, not the best of the t.A.T.u tracks (I prefered the Album Version to the Edit) and the All The Things She Said Remix was passable.This CD isn't much use now I have the Special Edition 200km/h In The Wrong Lane album. However it is still good on the whole."
