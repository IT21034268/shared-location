5,Mozart Piano concertos,This is a gem of a CD. Brendel displays his abilities very well and the orchestra behind him does a wonderful job. Mozart's piano concertos are some of the freshest efforts of all time and this CD does him justice.
5,Fabulous,Consistently clean and brilliant performances that never fail to capture the spirit of the compositions.
5,Beautiful!,"I love the Concerto in A, KV 488 Adagio. Hooked on it when I heard it used in an Air France commercial!"
2,Check disc 1 for flaws,"This was such a disappointing experience. The music on the CD is beautifully performed, but something must be wrong with the final track of CD 1 in the digital master. The CD played through until track 10, when it skipped repeatedly, making it impossible to listen to. I returned the item for a replacement, but the same thing occurred in the same section of the recording. Twice burned, I'm asking for my money back this time.I'd be interested in knowing if people ran into the same problem with the downloaded recording. The music is so well-rendered that I'd be willing to try a third time, but downloading instead of purchasing a physical CD set."
2,not recommended,"i suppose i had bad luck as i bought a defective version of this product and had to return it. however, i did test it out and noticed that it was not comfortable to use, and the fact that you can get similar much better pick-ups for the same price (barcus-berrys for example), should dissuade anyone from considering this product. the jack with the i-can't-believe-it-really-is-a-disposable-plastic-tie plastic tie method of attaching itself to the tailpiece, really is a total joke at best. the idea that someone thought that was a good idea is really quite interesting/hilarious.don't waste your money on this."
1,Violin/Viola Pickup,"Mounting is rather easy but fixing the connector with a cable tie is simply a mess.However, the main issue is the sound and this is rather horrible and much worse than 20 years old Barcus Berry pickups.I tried different locations of the bridge without any acceptable result.In my opinion, distortion an noise are much too high.Therefore the pickup only makes sense when you want to get an unnatural sound anyway and ad some electronics..."
1,flag with no pride,"I bought this flag because it was American made. This is a symbol of our country and I wanted to fly it proudly from out pontoon boat.This will NOT happen. I would not disgrace out flag by putting this on the boat. The quality is OK enough but the workmanship is lousy. the seams are out of line by as much as 1 half inch on a 12 inch flag.It is a disgrace.I have tried contacting Taylor Made about this and they do not respond.In my opinion the only thing about this flag is the label that states ""Made in america.""If you to proudly display the flag, DO NOT GET THIS one."
3,"flag looks better in photo, ugly stitching","Up close, this flag has big red stitching and folded-over ends everywhere. Gets three stars because product did arrive as advertised (size, colors, etc), but i have yet to test its durability. Let's see if it survives a summer tied to the lightpost off the back of the boat!This flag has not ripped or stained (we store it aboard the boat when not in use). So the product is durable, and recognizable from afar as the US colors. However, up close (within 5 feet of viewing), the stitching looks ugly.fair warning."
3,"Nice quality flag, but lasts less than 2 summers on Lake Michigan","I bought this flag two years ago. The flag has been flown of the boat for two summers. During the winter, it was taken off and stored. So, it was outside for approximately 1 year. Unfortunately, it shred to pieces after this period of time. However, the price is reasonable and it looks great flying over the boat. I would purchase it again."
3,Material quality good; sewing alignment of red stripes was poor.,"RED flag material is long enough that it laps to the other side, however, the red stripe doesn't not align with the red stripe on the other side.Taylor made box saids, ""Buy the Best"". Flag was returned for replacement. Replacement was made better... it was not perfect, but, I kept the replacement."
5,Great Flag,The flag is high quality and comes as advertised. The only complaint I have is that the stripes on one side of the flag do not match the stripes on the other so the color bleeds through. This is clearly evident in the product photo so it was no surprise.
1,Typical Hollywood an Oscar for what?,"This was hyped all over the place as a movie about the wine country, wine and a story of friends. Well once again Hollywood is deceptive, dishonest and abetted by the media we the viewers are cheated. Poorly written, boring dialogue with gratutious sex and four letter words throughout.. ad nauseum. We live near this beautiful area and I would be disgusted if a restaurant or a winery of mine were used in this film. Maybe the film shows how degraded our audiences are these days. I had really looked forward to movie night at home, was I in for disappointment. Oh and if like me you wanted to enjoy the beauty of the vineyards and this lovely area well instead they chose to focus on the inside of a bad motel. Irresponsible behavior with absolutely no consequences. Why do we have to give it one star, don't they have a no star."
1,Embarrasing!,"I'm really hoping that this was just the way hollywood people act because if it isn't, we as americans have fallen to a new low. What really was the point to this story? Where is the value that you'd want your kids to get out of this film? Why were people laughing when they were watching this? This movie degrades life in general. Maybe because americans have lost mostly all the moral values. I'm ashamed that i saw this, i was not expecting this kind of inmorality. This film was not entertaining and has no value to the american cinema. Maybe this is why hollywood actors don't have moral fiber anymore."
1,OUCH!,Could not even get through it. Loathed the characters from the start. Not funny or intelligent. It is absolutely not what I was expecting. Quite painful.
3,"Good, but not the best","this movie was kinda good, but it wasn't the best movie i saw. i thought that thomas haden church was funny in this movie. but thats about it."
4,I Never Liked Merlot,"Wonderful acting by Paul Giamatti and the beautiful Virginia Madsen highlight this story of two not very likeable guys ""last fling"" into the California wine country before the less likeable one (Thomas Haden Church) gets married. I understood how Giamatti's and Madsen's characters developed, but couldn't make sense of Haden Church's. Sandra Oh has a great scene as Haden Church's weekend girlfriend."
2,Ok at best... Not a full on comedy by any means...,People are either in love with this movie or completely hate it. I'm somewhere in the middle as I had heard nothing but phenomenal reviews for it. I was shocked at how much it wasn't a comedy and moreso a drama about two men trying to figure out 1)meaning of life 2) their place in it 3)neither one wanting to accept the realities of life. I think people relate to this movie because they suffer the same three things above and somehow feel that this movie makes it that much better for them. From an entertainment perspective it was ok at best.
2,"sorry, this is a dumb movie alert!","I did not like anything about this movie. The storyline plods along, the characters want to make you scream, and the ending was lacking."
1,A German Review,"Abfall! Schlechter Geruch! Hässliches Ding! Unangenehm! Fäkalmaterie Auf Einem Zahnstocher! Das ist, was ich an diesen Film denke. Trinkenden Wein hat das dicke Schwein in ein whiny kleines Mädchen gedreht. Er hätte eine Reise nach Deutschland nehmen sollen und hätte im dunklen Bier von unserem Land teilhaben sollen. Der Anhängermann, der nackt läuft, hat mich denke an eine riesige Wurst gemacht. Mmmmm! !!!!!"
1,Don't Bother...,"...unless you're in the mood for a film about a loser who steals from his elderly mother; lies to everyone he supposedly cares about - his best friend, the woman he supposedly loves...If you can develop empathy with Giamatti's miscreant character in this clunker of a film, more power to you. For me, the only good thing about the film was the brief scene with Sandra Oh with her legs up in the air. That's it."
2,Boring,"I think my title says it all. Boring. How did this snag an Oscar, much less the accompanying nominations?"
1,I'd rather watch grapes grow ...,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS-----Spoilers----Spoilers--Spoilers---spoilersI do not want to ruin the film for any who have not seen it yet, but the scene which really angered me came when a female character, believing herself to have been betrayed by a male character, smashes said male character in the face numerous times with her handbag and causes enough damage, we later learn, to require surgery. If any movie had shown a male lead beating the tar out of a female character, critics and feminist groups would have cried out-and rightly so. But the film simply goes on as though nothing much has happened and the guy assaulted makes it clear that he will not press charges. What's good for the goose should be good for the gander: Female on male violence should not be treated so lightly.Oh yeah, Miles is a morose and selfish loser who is a complete and utter bore with his incessant chatter about wine."
1,Worst Movie of 2004,Easily the worst movie of the year. No comparison. I have no idea why this is the 2nd best selling DVD on Amazon right now.
2,piNOT!,"i was very surprised and disappointed i didn't like this movie. my wife and i collect wine and we put off seeing it in the theaters because we wanted to watch it with a good bottle of pinot noir and savor them both. we also very much enjoyed ""about schmidt"" and ""election"".however, we couldn't get over how completely unlikeable either of the main characters were. that two attractive, mentally healthy women would fall in love with them just didn't seem plausible. it also didn't make sense that the characters would even like each other, much less be best friends.no in-depth critique here, we just found it dull."
3,Sideways? Was that the title or how you viewed it?,"I personally didn't enjoy the movie. I love a good merlot. Or pinot noir. But this movie seemed more about the silliness of semi-adult men who didn't want to commit to either marriage, or growing up. Stealing from your mother? That was so sad. The only nice part in the whole movie, for me, was the phone call he received in the end, giving him a chance at being an adult. Just hope he didn't blow it, again."
2,This is Blu Ray?,I was not impressed with the quality picture from this blu ray. It was not any different than my dvd picture. Very Grainy. Just not the usual blu ray quality. Love the movie still.
3,Sideways,"Paul Giamatti is a guy who is still trying to get over his ex wife who has recently remarried. Thomas Haydon Church is his friend who is soon to be married and out on a marathon getting laid campaign. There were some scenes that made me laugh, but the film kind of dragged at times."
2,Sideways,"I really didn't care for this movie. For all the hype it got when it opened I expected a lot more and I didn't want to go out and ""have a glass of wine"" like one of the other reviewers wrote."
2,Big Disappointment!,"I had been looking forward seeing this, but I was very disappointed. This is a dreary expedition into a world of barely-believable dialogue and self-consciously melodramatic metaphors. I expected more given the overwhelmingly positive critical outpouring, but I was unimpressed. There are much better things to do with your time than watch this whiny movie."
2,I should care because?,"Yet another movie that wraps itself in intellectual posturing and trite existential musings in a vain attempt to lend an air of profundity to adolescent shenanigans. Although it is well-executed and has bits of hilarity, ultimately this movie is as morose, aimless and self-indulgent as it's lead character."
4,Wine-tastin' Wise Guys.,"This movie is packed full of shock moments. It's a story about a pair of buddies . . .1 actor(Thomas Haden Chruch) + 1 Writer(Paul Giamati)= Nonstop laughs.Constantly these two are bickering while sipping wine and carrying on their vacation just before Miles's friend is about to get married. But on the way they encounter two females that will send their lives into an interesting turn.When it gets right down to it, there is too much Dialogue about wine. You get sick of it after a while. Wine this and wine that. It's silly. But Miles, the character we sympathize with, is obssesed with wine . . . and writing. What follows is the ups and downs of two buddies, one wild and one insecure into a nicely awkward comedy that is Sideways.Enjoy!"
2,"Yeah, yeah, I know...everybody loved it.","If you like Woody Allen and his genre of neurotic movies, you'll probably like this one. Personally, I don't. It has its moments, Sandra Oh is great and should have gotten far more, but the match between the male and female leads was unlikely and strained. It really didn't seem like Miles' was strained so far out of character as to break into another person's house, and anyway, he should get whatever he deserved because he lied through his teeth and broke the law. Ah, forget about it...not worth discussing really. By the way, I am giving away my copy of the DVD...anybody want it?"
2,Oh well...,"I love a smart, well written, quirky movie. 'Sideways' was none of these. It had potential, with great actors, a good , but overused premise (getting married this weekend so I want to party with my buddy and get ____.) There were definitely some good spots, Stephanie pounding away with her helmet, but as a whole, very disappointing. The whole pretentious wine-geek theme got old very early on. These fellas and gals could have just as easily been sports fanatics or techno-dweebs without adding or subtracting from the tired story line. The characters lacked dimension and never actually strayed from their initial presentation, they learned nothing, overcame anything, or scored life victories over adversity, they merely cheated their way out of jams. This film has been called 'quirky' and 'smart'. I would agree, if we could also apply the same words to 'Porky's"""
2,"Loathsome characters, but amusing in places","After all the attention paid to this movie in the last year, I finally rented ""Sideways."" As a wine fan and a Californian who is familiar with the Santa Barbara area wineries, I thought I might enjoy it.On some levels, this movie delivers. The cinematography is excellent, and the screenwriters knew their wine. There are parts of this movie that are really funny. But the movie never transcends the loathsome, reprehensible behavior of Miles and Jack, the two characters who are supposed to be our heroes. Their actions near the beginning of this movie do not make them sympathetic. Rather, they are established early on as pathetic middle-aged losers who deserve any and all of the bad things that happen to them. Even though Miles makes a stab at redemption near the end, it's too little, too late. There are some funny moments where we laugh at them, not with them, but then it's time to go back to looking at your watch and waiting for the the movie to end.Avoid."
2,Overblown.,"The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable. Basically, ""Sideways"" is a grown-up version of Road Trip or American Pie. Sure, there are metaphors such as the references to wine and their parallels to personalities in the movie. However, the rest of the movie is a series of epiphanies and middle age woes that have all been done before. I really appreciate the talent of Paul Giamatti, but Sideways merely tells the tale of two buddies spending one last week of bachelorhood together before Jack (Thomas Haden Church) gets married. There's nothing original here, and I was disgusted by the unnecessary full-frontal (overweight) male nudity. If you want a good movie surrounding a middle age crisis, I highly recommend ""American Beauty"" instead."
3,Not as good as the critics claim........,"Not bad, yet not that great either. An over-hyped movie.I only snickered two or three times throughout the movie.The European writers and directors do a much better job with this genre of a movie. I just can't understand how this movie gets nominated for best film of the year. Never the less I would still give this movie a thumbs up, but just barely. By the way, at the time of my review this movie hasn't even averaged a 5-star review rating . It hasn't even averaged a 4-star review rating, only a three and a half star average review rating. Doesn't that tell you something??????????"
2,"pretty good if you are fascinated by wine, otherwise, not much to it","Neither the story nor the characters were very interesting. The very realistic scenes had some appeal, especially for someone familiar with central coast California."
3,At the place,"We went on a wine tour with the Santa Barbara Wine and food paring tour, which took place where the movie was made. Fun seeing the same places that were in the movie."
4,Sideways blu ray,"The movie is quite a study of two friends that have serious character flaws, yet we become involved in their story hoping the best for them. If not the best, then probably their just desserts. The images are not up to blu ray expectations, or I would have given it five stars. Pour a nice glass of pinot, sit back and enjoy."
3,"Well, I learned something about wine","I think I would've enjoyed this movie more if I had not been anxiously anticipating ""the best film of the year."" It's a touching, sometimes funny, mid-life crisis/buddy film. I found myself waiting to be blown away, and I think this in part made me enjoy the film less. It didn't blow me away. In fact, I was more moved by ""About Schmidt."" Both are character films with great acting, but Schmidt just seemed more original, and it hit a deeper nerve. I found myself not feeling much for the main characters in Sideways. For a TRULY original buddy flick, rent the lovely and moving Norwegian film ""Elling."""
2,"I don't know what to say, folkz...","Comedy of the year? Puhleez. I usually give movies a chance and even surprised myself by keeping in my seat throughout the entire movie, but in the end found it crude, pointless and downright, well, pathetic. Is there any real point here except that you follow two guys, one that has a fling and goes back and marries another woman, while the other, who is more sympathetic but still a vulgar character, tastes wine and tries to publish his book (that --in the end-- never gets published)? Sideways could've been a less-than-stellar but somewhat (emphasis on ""somewhat"") mediocre and swallowable film if there was a valid moral point in the end, but alas there is not. Still, it's better than 2003's Lost In Translation which I didn't even sit through after about 20 minutes of absolute boredom, but that doesn't really say a lot."
1,Disappointed,"It's true, only 5% of a book is captured in a movie. I loved the book, and Miles was not such a sad sack loser as portrayed in the movie. He was funnier than Jack! The book ""Sideways"" deserved all the awards, the movie left much to be desired."
3,"Fair to middling, but no better.","Two boring, unsympathetic emotional cripples talk about themselves in terms of wine while feeling morally superior to one another."
2,A bit too graphic,I felt the main character was flawed in ways that made me uncomfortable. The graphic sex seemed unnecessary and watching the full frontal fat naked man running down the street turned my stomach. Did I get all the subtle messages of the movie? Sure. It was a very introspective piece. Did I get all the romance about the wines and was moved? Sure. Can't help but look at wine differently after this movie. But to spice up an otherwise boring movie with sex is just pandering. The only saving grace was Sandra Ho...she is now one of my favorite actresses and I hope to see her in more things. This is one of those movies you either really love or really hate.
3,Over rated,"After hearing so many rave reviews of this film, I was more than a little disappointed. It had its moments of course, and I appreciated the scenes where they described wines. But overall I found the film just mediocre."
2,This movie is very vulgar.,"This movie has good people in actors and actresses roles. However, I would not recommend this movie to most people because the vulgarity is not mentioned enough to people interested in this movie. The vulgarity serves little entertainment purpose."
1,INTELLIGENT comedy? I think not!,"This is NOT intelligent comedy. I don't even know of a movie that could fall under ""intelligent comedy"". I think most comedy is accessible to anybody, unless it sucks like this movie. All the jokes are is ""This wine is bad!"" or ""I just stole from my mom! Aaahahahahahahahaha!!"" or how about ""I just punched a guy in the face!"" for some originality?If you want DUMB comedy, buy this movie. It's really for people that laugh at nudity, wine, and immorality. Stealing from your mom? A little petty, but still, not that funny.Maybe if I was a wine snob I'd like it. Let's label this ""wine snob comedy"" and not ""intelligent comedy""."
1,SIDEWAYS,"I JUST READ A REVIEW WHICH I TOTALLY AGREE WITH. THIS MOVIE DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE, WAS COMPLETELY OFFENSIVE WITH THE NUDITY. AND MORALS - THERE WERE NONE!!! IF THAT'S WHAT MIDDLE AGE (I'M A 45 YEAR OLD WOMAN) MID LIFE CRISIS IS, LET ME DIE NOW!! AND THANK GOD I'M SINGLE, CUZ IF I COME ACROSS A GUY WHO HAS YET TO SOW HIS WILD OATS AT HIS AGE, HE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING MARRIED."
1,Hollywood still promotes asian stereotype.,"Great acting by Paul Giamatti.It's too bad that the Sandra Oh character (asian woman)is not given the same level of character development compared to the other three characters. Not only is Sandra Oh the only ""visible"" minority in this movie, she is the only character given a minor role. The role of Oh's character as the asian sex freak is simply used to offset the ""deep"" character developoment of the other three major characters. The Sandra Oh role should have been the Virginia Madsen character -- but then again Hollywood seems to be bent on maintaining certain stereotypes."
2,Perhaps I expected too much...,"After all the hype and awards nominations, I expected something a little different - like an ending that wasn't totally predictable, characters who weren't cliches, and a plot that went somewhere. Not in this movie. The only bright spot was Virginia Madsen, whom I found appealing despite her poorly drawn character."
1,Overlong and Overrated,"How is it that a movie about a couple of losers with no redeeming qualities and nothing interesting happening to them can recieve such acclaim? This film is basically the equivalent of ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" minus the giddy silliness and likable characters.I'm not saying this is a terrible film. I'm saying it's a bland, dull, and thoroughly unremarkable piece of cinema. The actors are all dead on, but who cares? It's dull and pointless and can't decide whether it's mature or silly or both. Lacking in grace, intelligence, or worth. I know that's harsh, but that's just the way I feel.Really, I didn't care for it one little bit."
2,Maybe 'Sideways' Needs Turned Right-Side-Up,"As hyped as this movie supposedly was, I found myself utterly bored throughout. I'm not even sure why this is considered a comedy, considering the only truly laughable moment came within the last quarter of the film. I came away quite disappointed by this one."
1,Boring!,"I actually thought this would be a movie I would like. Oh, how wrong could I be? Both my wife and I had a difficult time staying awake. I felt the main characters were rather pathetic ... the pace of the movie was too slow ... and I really didn't find any humor in this movie that I thought was supposed to be a comedy. About the only good thing I can say is that I received it as a gift and didn't spend my own money on it. This is only my opinion ... yours may differ."
1,What's the Excitement About?!,"I had looked forward to this movie with relish, liking very much past performances of the 4 leads. But this movie was so boring, ridiculous, trite, and immature I absolutely hated it. A loser teacher who can't quite get his novel together has to steal money from his mother to take his abusive so-called friend on a bachelor trip. Church's character is the worst. It was a trip back to highschool behavior for both these sorry fellows! How disgustingly sad that there are so many men in real life who behave in just that manner and still end up with a darling wife. This movie was a total waste of film. Not even the road scenes were good as an opportunity to film this gorgeous area of California was cast aside in what was (I am guessing)a pathetic attempt at 'character development.' As usual, the artsy-fartsy crowd thinks it has merit; I almost always disagree with their effete tastes!"
3,Hype Schympe,"I loved American Splendor. I thought it was a celebration of real life and when I left the theater, I was walking on a cloud. I heard this movie was even better, so my hopes were maybe disproportionately high.Even though I love pinor noir wine, stories about writers, buddy/slices of life movies, and scenes were women kick ass, I just didn't get this movie or what it was trying to say. Miles was odd in some scenes, stole from his mother, but otherwise seemed an okay guy. Jack was just a big huge pig. I had no idea what to make of it. It left me feeling disgusted with men."
1,No Stars was not an option - OVER-RATED MOVIE OF A LIFETIME!,"Sorry folks but this was the most over rated film I have seen in years. I loved Virgina Madsen and Sandra Oh - they were excellent - but who can really find it believable that they would date either of the lead actors? They are beautiful, sexy women and were portrayted as very intelligent as well - they would not date those men. Additionally, other than brief moments regarding these actresses there was nothing redeeming or important about these characters (any of them) that made you cheer or feel for any of them. You simply do not care about any of these people - oh except for the sadness you feel for the mother that gets ripped off by the son she is so proud of... SO SAD and pathetic!Overall the movie lacked in every way - I was utterly disappointed in it and the attention it got this year was unreal."
2,"Seriously? I mean really, seriously???","After all the hype surrounding this movie, I expected greatness. What I experienced was anything but. Exactly how does this movie merit ""Best Picture""? Good acting, fairly good comedy, mediocre story line. I have never before written a negative reivew as I feel it's not really worth my time. I had to break my own rule on this one though. I suppose this movie would be appealing to someone into wine, but I just don't understand all the hype. ""Best Picture"", seriously???"
1,Whiny drivel...,"One lead is a cardboard cutout, the other is a whiny pushover. This movie is just 2 long torturous hours of the shallow guy getting in predictable trouble and the whiny guy reluctantly helping him get out of it. And the whiny guys whines about his pathetic life and acts miserable. Oh, and they talk about wine, in such a smarmy, aren't-we-clever-using-wine-as-a-subtext way that I wanted to punch them all in the mouth. And you will too.What a tremendous disappointment."
2,UGH!,"Given the cast and hype, I really tried hard to like this film. I even waited a month before writing a review. The best thing I can say is that these actors did an excellent job portraying some really unlikable characters, doing some truly tasteless things. Seriously: Grown-up bad boys set out for pre-wedding fling weekend, wherein boy # 1 doesn't even PRETEND to care that he's about to be married; and boy #2, still wallowing in his (sniff) ""I can't believe I'm divorced, poor me"" pity party after three years? Stop. The best part of this film was the wine, and the scenes filmed in wine country. Not much else lived up to the hype -- except Sandra Oh's revenge scene -- assuming you can watch that far!"
2,Lacking dignity,This is a story about two middle age men who are liars. They lie to each other and to everyone else they meet. Where the movie went really sour for me was when Miles steals from his mother. After that the rest of the movie becomes very tedious.
2,UUUURRRGH...burp.,"There were exactly 2 laughs for me during this movie (hence 2 stars). One was the panoramic view of the clone-houses of Oxnard, California, and the other was the pained, confused expression on the bridegroom's face as he's married in an ancient Christian ceremony. My Orthodox friend's comment on that one was, ""There's no way he could have converted....""The whole movie is based on the shallow actions and verbalizations of two ghastly males. Now I like to watch a movie about ghastly males now and then, but these two made me feel rather nauseated. Eeek. How could darling girls like Stephanie and Maya even consider going to dinner with these two? Are things that bad for the single woman in California these days?? Was it the only way they could afford the great wine?? Could they not have dated each other instead?? Poor creatures...."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I went to see it kind of as a way to pass time while I was waiting for someone, but I really did enjoy myself. I found the movie to be very funny and it had a great story along with some very memorable characters. My favorite character in the movie was probably Sandra Oh's character. I just love her in this movie. She is actually the reason I started to watch Grey's Anatomy (which I love as well and she is great in). Everything about this movie was just wonderful."
1,Totally Overrated!,"I was excited to see this movie. After 20 minutes, I couldn't understand why it received so much hype! I didn't like it! There were a few funny parts and itz always great to see people work their problems out in the end. But there is a lot of context that leaves you feeling BLAH. Maybe I'm not deep enough to fully enjoy this movie, but I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE."
1,Quite a let down,"Tolbert has it right, this film is over-hyped, over-rated and overwhelmingly dull. I give it a little credit for some occasional humor, but I could find little to care about with Giamatti's character; too little screen time for Virginia Madsen; way too much pretentiousness for the wine-ohs, Sandra included. I did manage to stay awake, just to see if it ever ends. I'll come back an add on to this if it ever does."
1,"No, no, no!","As one reveiwer already stated, don't believe the hype! This is not a good film. Both lead characters are spineless, juvenile, cheating twerps who seem to subscribe to the notion that women are worthless disposable creatures put here simply for their pleasure and nothing more. But it's a movie that happens to discuss wine in some depth so somehow all these reviewers (and California residents) are fooled into thinking that somehow redeems the fatal flaws at the core of the writing and characters. What is it, exactly, that we are supposed to appreciate about men who cheat and couldn't care less about the consequences? What's funny about lying in order to get a woman into bed?Don't waste your money."
1,Drunken Losers,"I was never more disappointed in a movie. The two main male characters are drunken losers who try and interact with women. I don't understand how this movie got so many awards. I didn't think the plot was interesting; the men were skuzzy and creepy. If you are looking for a fun romantic comedy, this is not it. If you are looking for a pretentious movie that drags along with a hell of a lot of drinking, this is the movie for you."
2,Yawn!,"Does two guys going on a roadtrip through wine country to sample wines sound like a good premise to you? Someone thought so, but I don't agree. This movie was long and boring and for all the hype it got I'd said it doesn't deliver. There were a couple funny moments but not enough to hold my interest."
2,You don't need to drink wine to pass out from this movie.,"What a boring, drawn-out, and depressing movie. It's over 2 hours of watching people drink wine, endlessly complain about anything and everything, and turn a week-long bachlor party into a self-lothing pity party. I love the actors and actresses in this movie, and they played their chracters very well, but the script flowed like molasses and the ending of the movie left you in the same place where you start - physically and emtionally. I can see where some people might get cought up in the emotional suicide, but it was a waste of time for me. It's been a long time since I have been so disapointed in a movie."
1,Glad I only rented it,"I will have to stand in the minority on this film, a ""road story"" about a shallow loser and a superficial swine. I spent the first hour of the film wondering who was the more contemptible character, and ultimately had to go with the loser -- the superficial swine, at least, has a degree of honesty, even though this is bred primarily from his complete inability to think reflectively upon anything.Full disclosure: I gave up watching after the first hour. It quite beggars my imagination why I would want to spend even that much time with such monstrously stupid, viciously self-deceiving hypocrites. I mean, don't we get enough of that in the workplace? Anyway, this is why I'm glad I only rented it.And, I'm sorry, but in what imaginary universe does a trip to the ""California Wine Country"" get no further North than Santa Barbara?"
2,What gives?,I cannot for the life of me figure out why this movie has gotten all the rave reviews and praise. For one the main character (Miles)is hapless and pathetic---it was funny as George Castanza--here it is moronic and sad. Secondly his buddy Jack is a complete jackass loathsome to the point of disgust. There are a few lighthearted funny moments but they are few and far between. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth and I can only surmise that with the glut of TV shows turned movies that any original script no matter how bad it is has the potential of precieved greatness. In a nutshell this movie is borderline crap.
4,Hilariously offbeat,"A nice little film that turned the wine communities on their heads. If you drink wine, you know of, or have seen this film.The cast is great, and the ending isn't all ""Hollywood"". And the sex scenes had us rolling on the floor with laughter!"
2,Fooling the masses,"The only thing that makes you think this movie has substance is all the wine references. It spends endless amounts of time talking about wine, sounding very mature and intellectual, when at its heart this is another buddy comedy. The choice of wine is one that appeals to ""couples"". Wine tasting has become chic and seemingly intellectual, when actually wine is exactly the same as beanie babies: they only have value if you think they do.Basically, I found this film morally and intellectually corrupt, and, worse ... not funny. It bothers me so much reading all these high-brow sounding reviews that I had to write about it."
1,Terrible Disappointment,"We were really looking forward to this movie due to all of the hype. Unfortunately, it fell flat. It was billed as one of the best comedies of the year, but there wasn't anything funny about this movie. Instead, you felt loathing or pity for the main characters - a drunken divorced loser and his morally bankrupt college roomate, an aging actor and sexaholic. This movie really had potential, but it's amazing how Hollywood writers can take a good idea and completely ruin it. I felt like I completely wasted 120 minutes of my life watching this movie."
1,Awful!,"One star is too much for this movie. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! No kidding! Don't waste your money or your time. This movie felt like one long, boring commercial for the wineries! It was marketed as a comedy...that in and of itself is hilarious...the movie wasn't funny at all!"
1,can I please?...,"I just watched this movie via walmart.com dvd rentals. Is there a way to get my time back? I'd be willing to pay upwards of $1,000,000. Your time is more valuable than any sort of gratification this movie could ever possibly provide."
1,Can't believe I actually watched to the end...,"There is not a single redeeming trait to any of these characters. I hope they all die in a gigantic plane crash or nuclear war. Self-absorbed, self-loathing animals, that's what they are. Don't waste your time. Watch something else - anything else."
1,Boring,"I thought this was the worst movie of the year, boring. I snoozed thru it and have no clue why it get's such rave reviews."
1,Not worth it,"The hype for this movie didn't live up to the expectations, I turned it off in the middle."
1,Sideways,Language was horrible. Movie not as entertaining as I thought it would be. Was very disappointed.
2,OVERRATED!!!,"This has to be the most overrated film I've ever seen in my life! It's filled with great actors, but the two main characters are incredibly unlikeable. I actually was hoping for one of them (or both) to fall off a cliff or get run over by a truck. As for this film's ""comedy"" classification, I thought comedies were supposed to make you laugh. I don't think I'm going to listen to critics again..."
2,Pretentious and Depressing,"After suffering through the first half of this pretentious little film, I walked out. My companion, who stayed the course, later told me that it didn't get any better during the second half.Later I remembered that I have never liked Woody's Allen's movies for the same reason -- spending 123 minutes watching a neurotic whiner is not fun. On the other hand, if you like Woody Allen, you may like this.Of course, Paul Giamatti is simply playing a role in this film, and it may be that (unlike Woody Allen) the person he is in real life is markedly different than the person he portrays, as was the case with Reese Witherspoon inElection. If so, he's a great actor, because the viewer comes away despising the guy. Still, you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with either of these characters, much less two hours.Yes, the California scenery is lovely, but the endless wine talk (""a strong oak finish, with a hint of garlic and peanut butter""), as in real life, is insufferable."
1,depressing movie,"Movie about two losers in LA--nobody actor and loser writer who likes wine. That's the story! What this movie teaches, points out, or at least makes us laugh? There is no message, nada. But if you like losers, you will love this movie. The only thing I liked was inovative cinematography. But no cinematographer can save movie with no story."
2,Sideways,"Sideways is a mean-spirited, depressing, slice of life look at the human condition. I did not find it funny. I saw nothing to laugh at. It's not a comedy. In fact for me it ranks with Ishtar, and Heaven's Gate. Too bad I bought it."
1,DULL,"I turned it off after just an hour. This film did nothing for me except bore me half to death. I thought the two lead characters (especially Thomas Haden Church's) were uninteresting to the point of being pathetic. You know those films that you just keep waiting to get better and they never do? Well...ladies and gentlemen, exhibit A."
1,DISGUSTING,"This film goes from bad to worse. No, it's not okay to steal from your mother, sneak away while she's asleep, have indiscriminate sex with anyone you can find just before your wedding, lie to women and children, and get drunk as frequently as possible under the guise of wine tasting. Even the casting was absurd. Only in his dreams could Paul Giamotti's character attract the two women cast as his former wife and lover. What does he have to offer? Certainly not looks, no money or scruples, a failed writer and an alcoholic - just what every woman wants...NOT."
3,Could have been better,"this was the most highest acclaimed film last year which gave me reason to watch this film. unfortunately i did not think that it lived up to all the hype. it's a story about two men who go on a trip the week before one of them is about to get married. and while on this trip, the man about to get married sleeps with another woman several times. this movie is really not anything to be praising, other than paul giamatti's role, this movie is not worth watching. i hope that others will not do as i did and expect this film to be something great when really it is no where near what it could have been."
2,Art Cinema's Downfall...,"The sad fact of this movie is that people adore it and the garbage of which it's comprised. While Paul Giamatti is great he really should stick to playing characters like the goofy ""Pig Vomit"" of Howard Stern. Essentially, this movie puts forth two things as solving all the problems of marriage and (early) middle age: 1) drink your troubles away and they'll still be there, and 2) if you don't feel like fidelity's your thing by no means should you be bound by it, impending marriage or not. Take my advice, save your money and your time and watch something of even slightly more quality. On a positive note, both actors have their funny moments, the scenery's amazing and the film is well shot, despite being mostly crap."
2,Just OK. May be worth skipping.,"See Lost in Translation first and Adaptation with Nicholas Cage. Sideways just didn't impress me much. It was cute, but not worthy of all the praise. Certainly a cliched artsy type ending. Oh brother, the drama of it. Oh for the sake of ""art""."
3,California dreamless,"Miles and Jack are on their way back to Jack wedding.Miles is a wine kind of guy and Jack is a hunk actor with over developed libido.They had been roommates in the college dorm, but besides that have very little in common.Miles is a pinot type of expensive drunk whose life is at whathe thinks is a dead end.Some strange pair are these.These two guys made San Diego look bad.But the acting an plot is pretty good and what is very much a tragedycomes off as comedy."
2,Wildly overrated.,"May I ask, who in Hollywood thinks it's a great idea to make ""comedies"" about depressed, self-centered, pasty white guys? The best scene in the movie is when Sandra Oh clobbers the philandering and--did I mention--self-centered Haden Church character. I recommend that you don't always fall for the hype."
3,"Disappointing, despite delightful moments...","For me, this started slowly, got quite a bit better, then got somewhat immoral and ugly, then got boring again, then ridiculous, then concluded with a happy ending neither of the main characters deserved. Neither Giamatti nor Church played likable characters. The best thing in the film is Virginia Madsen, who was other-worldly radiant as the angel of death in ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and is realistically radiant here. I had a lot in common with Giamatti's sad-sack broken-hearted failure, and one of my best friends behaves a like lot Thomas Hayden Church's character. Halfway through the film, I was planning to send my copy on to him to see if he agreed that these men were a lot like us. By the end of the movie, I disliked both men so much that I changed my plan, and I'll be donating this DVD to our Friends of the Library book sale in the Spring."
5,A new favorite,"I'd bet that almost everyone knows someone a little or a lot like a Miles or a Jack in this movie. Everything about this movie is just great. Totally entertaining from start to finish. Two polar opposite friends personalitywise, go on a week long wine tasting trip , making for one of the best 'buddy movies' ever made. But it's satisfying on deeper levels too. The situations those guys are in, nearly scene by scene, are things alot of middle aged folks can relate too and the comic interplay between Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church is just perfect. I nearly died laughing at the 'run the car into the tree' scene! Lots of others too.. The beautiful wine country backdrops give the movie such a unique 'California cool' vibe too and also the laid back , cool jazz music from the very 1st scene at Miles apartment. The movie is so well done, from the screenplay to the character development to the plot....I can't think of anything negative about this movie at all. A new favorite."
2,"Sideways or right side up, its boring","Sideways is about 2 friends who take a week-long trip through California wine country before one of them gets married, and hook up with two hot women. The good things were the acting was excellent and the dialogue was written by a real writer, not some of the hacks that write most of the movies made today. The bad is it was pretty dull most of the time. I've heard this called a comedy masterpiece but I didn't see it. I don't think I laughed out loud once; I smiled and chuckled a few times. I did end up rooting for something good to happen to Paul Giamatti's character in the end, but some of his problems wouldn't have exitsed if he had a backbone. Thomas Hayden Church's character had no redeeming qualities I could see and I saw no reason why the two guys were even friends. There was also a scene that was unnecessarily vulgar. I like some of what they tried to do with Sideways, but it didn't work well enough."
1,Blu-Ray Quality Sub-Par,"First and foremost; I want everybody to know that I absolutely love the movie ""Sideways."" That being said, do not waste your money on the Blu-ray edition of this particular film. When I dropped the cash for Sideways Blu-ray edition I was expecting to see sharp, crisp, and beautiful scenes of the Southern California vineyards as well as better sound quality. I didn't get either. What I got instead was a lesson that ""NOT"" all Blu-ray DVD's are created equal. There is absolutely ""ZERO"" difference between my standard DVD version and the Blu-ray version of the movie.If I had to guess, it may very well go all the way back to the film equipment that was used to film the movie on set and location. Lesson learned for me :-)"
2,It's just not THAT good...,"From earlier reviews, you'd think this was a hilarious movie. It isn't. A few laughs, yes, but overall, a depressing film about two losers in wine (or as one reviewer wrote ""whine"") country. Miles' character is so self-pitying, so morose, you just want to smack him. Jack is just a womanizer. It's hard to see how these two would hang out together. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The whole scene with Cammi was just not necessary. I'd lump this one in with The French Lieutentant's Woman, Chariots of Fire and the Accidental Tourist - over-done, over-hyped and over."
5,Great movie.,"Have seen Sideways numerous times, and with each viewing it gets richer. Locations are dynamite, the quartet cast plays beautifully off one another, and the story and directing are totally solid. Giamatti delivers his role perfectly and Thomas Haden Church is a hilarious wing man.Whether wine enthusiast, film enthusiast, or both, it is worth seeing!"
3,i've seen better!,"really not a bad movie, you can actually sit through it and not be bored. i thought it would be better considering all the awards it won but then again there was the movie- fargo that won a lot of awards and was a real stinker! this was an ok movie to watch once but i would never watch it again! plus the ending leaves you hanging which sucked! go ahead and rent it before you buy it or you may feel you wasted $20!"
2,too depressing for me,"There was some good humor in this movie, but overall I found it to be sad and depressing. I couldn't empathize with the main characters, a failing writer who steals money from the stash in his mother's underwear drawer, and the small-time actor who sleeps around, despite the fact that he is engaged to a woman that he loves and claims to be unable to live without. While I felt some pity for them, I didn't think their plight contained much worth laughing about. There was some hope for one in the end, and several amusing situations, but these did not redeem the film in my opinion."
1,I should have known better,"I should have known better than to listen to the Academy of Arts and Sciences. While they are a collection of extremely smart people, rarely do my tastes in really good movies ever agree with theirs. I kept waiting for something, anything to happen to keep this from being the most boring and predictable movie I was thinking it would be from a glimpse of the first 10 minutes. Alas, my wait was for naught. Nothing against any of the actors, they handled their characters with the professionalism expected of actors of their caliber, however, the actual plot was a lost cause. Couldn't have cared less about the plot. It was plopped down without aplomb probably hoping that someone would care about what was happening to any of the characters. Wrong. Didn't Care. Next time, try to invest a little more into the sheme. The actors in the movie deserved more..."
1,Sideways : DO I live on another planet than the rest of you?,"I cannot understand how anyone thought this was a good film. The characters were completely unlikable, the plot was empty. And oh my gosh, this movie was so void of any character I am just going to end this review now, cause I just don't care enough..."
1,What do people see in this?,"This was an awful movie. I wanted to shut it off halfway through, but I didn't due to its notoriety. I regretted my decision to stick with this shallow, self-indulgent and whiney monument to inconsequence. It's pretentious abuse of metaphor does nothing to make you give a hoot about any of the characters in the film. This movie focuses on mediocrity, and the result is sub-mediocre."
1,Mindless Dribble,Worst movie I have ever seen. I kept waiting for the laughs and the movie to take off. Didn't happened. Save your time and money on this boring film.
1,So overrated that 1 star is a gift!,This movie is one of the most over rated movies of 2004. My wife and I had another couple over this past weekend to watch this movie and by the time we had reached the the 1/2 way point we were no longer paying attention. The story is very weak and characters are shallow and gave you no reason to care for what they did. This movie is so forgettable it will be in the $5 bin at your local department store in less than six months.
1,hate it,boring. By which i mean super boring. like amazingly so. Being wine-buzzed did not help. Even writing this review while wine drunk is boring. doesnt even deserve the 1 star i had to give it. blahhhhhhh
2,Who cares?,"Start with two two-dimensional characters, the neurotic angst-filled aspiring author and the lower-tier TV actor.(The latter, by the way, is played by Thomas Hayden Church, so he's certainly familiar with the territory.)Add a simple plot. Tour California wine country and get laid as much as possible before the wedding. And drunk. Throw in cardboard cutout womens and wonder why nobody laughs at the ""humor.""(I misspelled ""womens"" because they're that irrelevant here.)The one-liners didn't hit their target, the plot is so familiar, and I don't care at all about the characters. I needed 45 minutes to turn it off, but that was because I'd just collapsed on a floor mat after a workout. It really isn't worth 45 minutes of my life.But on the plus side, the scenery is truly gorgeous."
1,Pretentious and Dull,I found nothing redeeming about this movie. I didn't even find it remotely funny. The haughty wine tasting scenes were pretentious and elitist. Most scenes dragged on for long periods of time with no real sign of changing. Don't waste your time or money on this stinker.
2,Boring,"While watching this movie I kept telling myself ""this can't be THIS bad can it?"" and then it ended and sure enough it was that bad. And stupid and unbelievable. Just because a movie is ""little"" doesn't mean it has to be ridiculously bad. Giamatti had one or two funny moments, just because he plays a good oaf."
1,"Horrible!!! If you're a wine lover, you'll hate this movie.","If you know anything about wine, you'll know how this movie is full of $@#!. And a distressing effect from this bass-ackward movie was how much the price of pinot noirs shot upwards after the release. I enjoy a good pinot noir, but it's a young, lighter wine. Great in its place, but it's not this expensive, snooty wine the movie makes it out to be. Don't be a follower, drink what you like, and don't take ANYTHING in the movie as fact."
1,4 thumbs down,This movie sucked ass! Anyone who would find this movie enjoyable or even funny must have found the mating of flies interesting!
2,123 minutes of my life I'll NEVER get back!,"If you like trashy movies with graphic sexual content, then go for it. If you've grown up and aren't really interested in watching people going at it (especially when one of them is engaged), then DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY on this movie. It is in my ""steaming pile of crap"" movie category. Long, boring, vulgar, etc."
1,It really is quite simple:,"1. Do you approve of alcoholics consious of their problem?2. Do you approve of a son stealing money from his elderly mother?3. Do you approve of a man who cheats on his wife?4. Do you approve of lying?If you answered ""no"" to all of these question I doubt you'll like the movie.The main character's actions are deplorable and yet people seem to like this movie, which by the way was based on a true story. Makes me nervous when stories as such gain popularity, seems as though people are ignoring the basic principles of human decency for a couple of laughs."
1,oh,This movie is so not funny. Two ugly guys talking about wine? And I so so done with this film when the naked man comes running outside and presses his naked body against the car. The only good part was with Sandra Oh.
1,Terrible Movie,A waste of time and money! Maybe because I am picky and have strong morals. Was not aware of the perv. content.
1,the worst movie i have ever seen,"this has to be the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen a lot of movies. there were maybe three good scenes in the movie. i completely wasted two hours of my life! this movie was boring, dull and disgusting. it was completely uninteresting. i forced myself to continue watching, thinking it would get better, but it does not! DO NOT see this movie!!!!!!"
1,Overhyped film of the decade,"Truly a nothing film. The only thing I like about this film is that it offended tight-wad Christians. Might appeal to wine snobs as much time is wasted pontificating about wine. I am in complete agreement with the review below this one.The only possible benefit to watching this film would be receiving an improved outlook on your own life after witnessing a few losers and morons cluelessly attempting to negotiate their pitiable, uninteresting lives."
1,"No glamour, no fun, plus poor cinematography","Being both a wine and movie lover, we were so excited to be among the first to experience ""Sideways"". It had gotten spectacular reviews. So, I couldn't believe the end credits were rolling and I hadn't spotted the good part. Where was the fun? Where was the enjoyment of California wine country?Are we expected to believe that two boring, ugly, aging guys can attract two fabulous, interesting, hot women? Are we expected to believe that it's OK and fun to steal from your mother and lie to women? Are we expected to believe that the camera can't get any reasonably attractive shots of vineyards? Both of us were horrified by this complete waste of time."
1,What's the appeal?,"I put this one in the ""Lost In Translation"" category--meaning that the critics loved it and I felt like I'm from another planet because I thought it sucked. There's alot of wine tasting in this movie & Paul Giamatti's snobbery in the way he critiques the wine he drinks makes me frustrated to the point of wanting to punch him. The premise is of a man, Hayden Church, spening his last week being single trying to have sex with anyone he can before his wedding - (his buddy Paul Giamatti goes with him to ""vacation"" in the california vineyard area(s))-- Each character has their flaws which the movie focuses on, whereas I was focusing on my dvd players fast-forward button."
4,Who IS that on the dvd box art?,"I can't stop laughing at the artwork for the dvd case. Paul Giamatti is a terrific actor, there is NO arguing that. But did the marketing team have so little faith in the ability of this film to move off of shelves without having to virtually, completely alter his visage so as not to scare people away? While all four actors clearly benefit from the work of a skilled airbrush artist, I am in disbelief at how ""pretty"" Giamatti is made to look on it...so alien, so not him. THAT aside, this is yet another fine film by Alexander Payne, who's now 4 for 4. Great director."
1,How do I give this movie ZERO stars??!?,"This is the most pretentious, un-funny so-called 'comedy' I've ever seen!! The only time I even laughed (snickered, actually...not even a chuckle) was when they were trying to ram the car into the tree.Furthermore, when Miles went into his pompous-ass wine review mode, I just sat there in silence, shrugging my shoulders with my eyes just glazed over and thinking to myself ""huh..?!?"".Also, how many scenes were there where Miles drank enough to kill an elephant (on top of his Xanax, nonetheless) and got behind the wheel without a second thought? Nice message."
5,Great Film!,"I know that some people think that this movie is slow but this film, at least to me, is absolutely hilarious and so true to life. I've watched it at least ten times in the last couple of years."
5,A Very Funny Movie,"I didn't know what to expect when I entered the movie theatre to watch this film, but one thing I didn't expect was the ache in my side from laughing. A hilarious comedy about the ""bachelor's vacation"" to the wine country, it chronicles Miles, a yet-to-be successful author and wine connoisseur and his college best friend, Jack, the soon-to-be married, washed-up actor trying to get laid before the big day. They have a hilarious adventure through Santa Barbara wine country, as the meet people, create relationships, and, discover what's truly missing (or already there) in there lives. A must-see romantic-comedy-drama with an ending to good for Hollywood."
4,This movie is almost perfect.,"At the beginning, I thought things were moving a tad slow, but by the time the ball got rolling, this movie started to really make me feel along with Paul's character. He is a great actor in this. I would rate this more like a 4.5. The extras contain several things as well, which is always a good feature for DVD's. This story is depressing to me, but it's really good. I would certainly suggest a rental for this selection, I know for sure it is at least worth that."
2,I've met some loser men...,...but I don't think any of them were as hideous as the two protagonists in this movie. I should have just quit watching when the one guy steals money from his old mother (obviously not for the first time).Any good acting is more than offset by the ugliness of the male characters.
3,Because you wanted to.... me first!,"Is it me or does Paul Giamatti always deliver? It's fitting that like fine wine, you may have to watch this movie more than once to fully savor its richness. While Giamatti delivers yet another on target performance, it's Virginia Madsen who anchors this film. Her performance opens your mind to the world of wine tasting and how, like tattoos, it's a very personal and individual experience for all of us. Of course, the zany, madcap events of the boys last hoorah helps move things along too. It's funny how relationships shape and direct our lives. Sideways offers so many things to it's audience that it's hard to pin down exactly what makes this film tick but in the end, I think it's about vulnerability and in that respect Sideways delivers."
5,A must-have for your video collection,The great thing about this film is that it holds up and you can view it again and again. This is a warm cup of cocoa on a Saturday night alone movie. Buy it. You won't be sorry.
3,Teen Road Trip Movie with Middle Aged Men and Wine,"Maybe I'm just too young to get it. While it's not a bad movie by any means, it's not great either. It really is just a teen comedy complete with drinking and sex jokes. It has a veneer of sophistication with the wine and divorced man pining for his ex and lost career, but that to me comes off almost as snobbery.There are a few scenes which are memorable, but not really that many. One of the great things about it is that it's mostly shot on location which is not common these days. Also the acting is very good until the movie's almost over, and then some of the seconds don't live up to the par of the leads.So, if you like this type of art house comedy then go for it. If you like any of the actors, the same. If not, maybe see it at a friends house."
3,Depressing,"I found Sideways to be an eminently depressing, sad little movie.Wine has got to be the most likable drik on Earth, its culture one of the most fascinating and they managed to make this out of it?You'll get a couple smiles out of it but overall, the aftertaste is a bitter one."
1,Not Worth Two Hours,"Once again, a movie reinforces our belief that we shouldn't bother watching movies that critics like. Maybe we are different than them, or maybe they can't see the forest for the trees, I don't know. But if you count yourself as an average person who is simply looking for a movie that isn't boring, do yourself a favor and skip this one. Watch it, like we did, and you'll want your 2 hours back."
2,A barely okay movie,"After all the hype and five star reviews I finally watched this movie, and all I can say is that this is just a mediocre stab at filmmaking. There is nothing special about it. The plot is plain. The characters are boderline annoying. There a few good moments sprinkled thourghout, but they're too few and far between to redeem this pretensious film. Paul Giamatti's character has actually made me hate wine. See this movie if you must, but rent it first."
1,"Little Plot, Lots of obscenities.","I did not particularly enjoy this film. It was full of gratuitous foul language and simply did not have an interesting plot. It was very slow in places, though it did have a few cute moments. I certainly did not feel it was worth the $10 to purchase the DVD."
1,Big disappointment,"This movie was awful. It doesn't deserve any stars at all, frankly. First of all, it's about two losers who really should have it more together, as old as they are (stealing money from your mother? PLEASE...).But worst of all, there was the sex. Not even sexy sex. Ugly, pornographic sex, the kind only high school boys and losers would enjoy. Now I'm a big girl and I know what an ""R"" rating is supposed to mean, but I really didn't see full-frontal male nudity and porn-flick-style, pumping and groaning intercourse coming (no pun intended). This is the kind of movie you might pick for a date and then be horribly, profoundly embarrassed, so much so that you'd never want to see that date again. Can't they warn people, for crying out loud?? At least the porn people are honest about what they do for a living."
1,Bad,A lot of tasteless nudity that was not needed. It had its funny moments but none of it was laugh out loud funny mostly chuckle funny. I was disapointed in this movie and I thought it was just all around bad. This movie was also degrading of women making them appear to be easy. I hated it.
2,Don't know what all they hype was about,I found this movie to be very slow and just boring and depressing in general. The wine references used in descriptive form were way beyond reason and became a real turn off.
3,Not as good as I expected,"Had heard about this movie for years, finally watched it. Funny in spots but ultimately I found it hard to like or empathize with the main characters; they both come across as losers. Lots of pretentious blather about wine, perhaps of interest to an oneophile, which I am not."
3,"Not as Good as the Critics Say, but not as Bad as I Thought","I finally got a chance to see this film last night and while I found the story amusing, it wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. First off, this is not a laugh out loud comedy. The humor is very subtle and will likely put a smile on your face rather than making you laugh for all to hear. The acting by the two leads is really good, even if the characters are totally unlikable. I don't regret renting this one, because to me it is better than most reviews here would indicate, but nowhere near the greatness that most movie critics claim it to be. Barely *** out of *****"
3,Good but long,"I rushed to see this at the theatre on it's first weekend before I'd hear anyone's opinion on it, and before all the tv commercials came out to ruin it. I was looking forward to seeing it since all the interviews with the actors made it seem like a great film. And I did enjoy it, but I thought it was a little long winded. I thought it was funny and sad at the same time, but I got restless and lost focus on it. It is a good movie, but didn't quite live up to the hype surrounding it. The acting was good (maybe not Oscar winning material) but it just wasn't enough to hold my interest. Sorry."
2,TERRIBLE!,"How many movies have you seen that there is a man traveling, meets a woman, sleeps with her, has a wedding on Saturday, dumps the girlfriend, goes home after his fling and gets married without the bride knowing about his fling? I felt like I've seen this movie many times. Forces of Nature is one of the movies about making it home for a wedding. The movie was boring, and I can't understand anyone liking this movie, but they do, and got good reviews.I know the movie wasn't just about that, but it was slow moving and dull."
3,Sideways glance at Sideways,"a good movie, but not as great as people said it was when it first came outI'm prudish enuf to have been shocked by the nudity, isn't that funny?"
2,Waste of time,For a few tasteless jokes mostly against women this movie goes on and on. They sure do drink a lot of wine but that's it.
4,"Fun movie, don't drink Merlot while watching!","This was part of wine theme double header. The first movie was Bottle Shock, which was based on true events would get my 5 star rating. Sideways was equally good but not as good as Bottle Shock. I did like the comedy in Sideways and the interplay between the characters."
3,pretty good film,this film started off kinda slow for me so the pacing hurt it with me early on&there were some cliche buddy type of things going on that i have seen. once the film got cooking then it was a trip. I dug the music. the backdrop of the film had a retro feel going on.it has alot of funny moments but I wish the film had have jump started a bit more quicker.
1,You either love it or you hate it...,"and I hated it! I did not think it was funny at all. The characters did not invoke anything in me. There are so many people who think this movie was one of the best, they are entitled to their opinion, but I would never recommended anyone to see this movie."
1,Pointless and boring,"Usually when there is a movie out there that people seem to either love or hate (usually due to controversy surrounding the movie), I am part of the minority that loves it. But in this case, I thought this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I think the premise was interesting and just wish that more could have been done with it. Instead the film was dragged down by predictability and laughably bad dialogue."
2,Too Much Hype For Suck,"I must say that I hated this movie with a passion. I was bored to tears the entire time. Of course, like all movies, it had is moments, but they were few and far between. The acting was there, the storyline was just really bad. I suppose someone who's is having/had a midlife crisis, or is even of that age, would enjoy this movie more than I did. However, it takes a lot for me to hate a movie and this is one of those movies that is in the hate category. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Utterly awful,"Unless you are an aging movie executive hitting your midlife crisis, get another movie. Sideways is a pretentious, inane film that is also boring. The acting is as wooden as the new Star Wars films and the plot as shallow as a puddle."
1,S L O W,I just had to mention that this movie starts painfully slow. Like waiting for ketchup to pour from the bottom of a bottle. It will take extreme patience to continue watching.What a let down after all the hypeRating: Skip it
2,Unlikeable Characters,"This is a big flop, I was disappointed. None of the characters were likeable and it went too slow. Church plays a pretty good slime guy you can partially feel sorry for but Giamatti should get the ""Dork Actor of the Year"" award for this. How embarrassing, the pathetic novelist who is so unsure of himself, BOO HOO BOO HOO BOO HOO.There was absolutely no moral message in this film, except what NOT to do with your life. All the characters were quite pathetic and in some cases not very believable. Thanks for letting me vent."
4,Its a keeper,"I just recieved this sword for christmass and I must say, I am very pleased, due to the type of steal its an easy blade to wield and its nice and shiny ( despite the fact that its NOT SHARP ). However, The pictures of the sword look nothing like the actuall sword. The sword I recieved has BLUE wrapping around the handle and the hilt is a DARK GREY, not bronze. Also, the red rope on the sheeth is right at the top of the sheeth, not where it is in the photo. Over all its a great sword but the photos are decieving."
1,this product is horrible,"I am very unsatisfied with this product! I like collecting swords and such and when i read the products description I was under the impression that the sword would come sharpened which it was not and the craftsmanship was horrible. It came with sticky stuff all over the sheath, the handle wasn't even secured on it came right off and it looked like maybe it was glued on. I would not recommend purchasing from this company"

3,"Bach, 6 Cello Suites / Maurice Gendron","I also agree this is a good performance. His playing is so fast comparing to others like Casals, Fournier and even Fournier.Then, this style of his playing seems not to be best for me. Original idea of this title analysed and played by Casals was like 'PLAYING DANCE (gavotte, gigue and etc.).But, the idea of Gendron seems more concentrated in playing itself only.Though, it is recommendable performance, but somebody that wants to buy shall listen to this item before purchase, if possible."
5,Peerless - for 30 years,"I feel qualified to write a review of Gendron's Bach Suites, having won the International Bach Competition in 1985 in Washington, DC, for the very same pieces.Gendron is the standard by which all others are judged. Structure, voicing, integrity and tone quality have never been matched in such a combination by anyone - ever. Gendron let the music shine through, never letting his personality interfere with Bach's perfection."
4,Nice but expensive,Beautiful buy too expensive for what it is. Price not worth the comforter. Need extra large washer or have professionally cleaned
1,Upstairs Downstairs Season 5,"Unfortunately Amazon sent us 2 seasons 4, instead of the seasons 4 and 5. Do not know how to contact Amazon on this problem so guess cannot review the product, but will sit here and pout instead."
5,02 Olds Intrigue,Used on a 02 Intrigue with 200k miles. Perfect cause I didn't want to spend much on this old car. Worked great.
4,interesting,"I'm not much of a DC fan and I am a big fan of Marvel, so I thought that this would be interesting, getting to see Stan Lee ""create"" the classic DC characters. And it was interesting if not great. I think he did a great job with Batman, though he's the one DC character that needs no tweaking. The Wonder Woman story was pretty interesting, though not something I'd want to see a whole lot of (though certainly better than her original version). His Superman was weak. There isn't a whole lot you can do to change Superman, so Stan Lee was sort of doomed from the start. His Green Lantern was basically Silver Surfer. Beside what can you do with Green Lantern. It was all very interesting though."

5,S U R P R I S E D AND GLAD OF HER!!!,"I was shocked the first time i heard Let your head go, i couldn't believe it was Victoria!!! its an excellent dance track if you haven't listened u don't know what u r missing.11/10This groove is a cool track its like a ballad with dark slow beats 8/10the videos for this singles both we're on the top 10 of TRL in The UK at the same time no,1 both!!so listen to this you are not going to be dissapointed"
3,Grooving and Letting My Head Go?,"Victoria has produced a killer single. How killer? Killer. Not very killer... not semi-killer... just killer.SONG #1: Let Your Head Go is an awesome track. It's definitely my favorite Victoria track to date (well, there wasn't much competition)... The beat is remix-ish, but not too remix. I love this song to death. GO VICTORIA!SONG #2: This Groove should not have been released. This single should have just been ""Let Your Head Go"" with ""This Groove"" as the semi-okay B-side. Poor showing, Vic. Poor showing.Overall, this single's good. I just hate 2xA sides..."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"I had to use this book for my CIS Data Structures class. The book's description of actual data structures is confusing. The implementations in Java are sparse. The website is not useful. I even emailed the authors' for clarification on some topics and they never returned my mail. What ever you do, don't buy this book."
1,Because i can't give 0/5 stars... TERRIBLE text,"This text book is a terrible attempt at education. It lacks the code to demonstrate test drivers to help the learner understand how to apply any code snippets demonstrated, and also represents most of the material in garbled pseudo-code, instead of teaching from code itself.I'm currently reading through chapter 9 - hash tables, and with the sheer lack of examples (the author thinks 3 paragraphs is enough to teach hash codes?) it makes it nearly impossible to understand this subject.The approach the authors took in this text is to refresh the memory of the programmer who has already mastered the subject. This is NOT a text designed for those new to the subject.Sadly, as long as educators keep falling for this hideous book, students will be continually required to spend their hard-earned cash and support the authors in this pathetic attempt at education."
3,Okay book...,"This is for the fourth edition, which from other reviews doesn't suck as bad as the first two...It's an okay text book - but I pity anybody who doesn't have either experiance working with data structures in C or C++ OR who hasn't taken a Finite Math class specifically for CS.Only get it because you need it for a course, spend as little as possible and then dump it on eBay as quick as you can. Not worth keeping as a reference."
2,This isn't it.,"If you need a good book on Data Structures and Algorithms I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere. I obtained this book to use as a reference for a class I helped teach as a TA, and in going through it I found it to be very difficult to understand. The main thing that I disliked was that some essential subjects are merely glossed over."
1,Just awful,I wish this wasn't assigned for my Java Algorithms course. Obtuse definitions and few examples. I am having to look elsewhere for better explanations. Thank god for torrents.
4,...,"This book requires careful and thoughtful reading, as well as practice on “non-start-from-scratch projects”. I was required to buy this text for my CS2 Data Structures and Algorithms course. While not willing to spend more, I had managed to learn and even implement examples in my course projects, as well as in C. Moreover, I found rather interesting/uncommon chapter on Text Compression. However, hint server on the text webpage could have been updated with more hints."
2,Not very good,"I've been reading this book and find it to be quite dry, and in fact, I don't find the explanations all that enlightening, especially in light of the fact that the errata sheet for this book is probably about 10 pages long, both in Java and English syntax and errors. In particular, I didn't find their mathematical explanations very helpful, especially on topics such as Big O notation and induction. If you want a good book on Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, this is not the book."
4,Nice book if you like mathematics,"I am using this book for a course on the Dutch Open University. As I am aleady graduated on Operations Research, it is really nice to see how some algorithms like the shortest path and the maximal flow can be implemented with classes in Java. This first part of the book is more concerned with the basics and can be a bit boring before the real fun begins. However, the abstract level is quit high and sometimes it takes some effort to fully understand what the author means to say. If you like mathematics tou probably will like the book."
2,Flawed.,"This book contains a very dry descrition of many fundamental data structures, with some pretty bad implementations in Java thrown in. I did not like the book at all. The explanations are always overly formal and often misleading. The CD is as usual with such books, useless, as is the website they advertise. I bought this text because it was required at one of the courses at the university. Anybody who is looking for a good textbook on the subject should look elsewhere."
2,Lafore's Data Structures & Algorithms is more understandable,"I bought this required text not by choice and doesn't like it at all. The explanations are confusing. Worst, there is no solutions to its exercises. I highly recommend Lafore's Data Structures & Algorithms in Java, either as an substitute or additional reference."
3,okay but not great,"The book isn't bad, but it's not the best book ever. It is very mathematical, which I don't mind, but sometimes the author tries to be way to general and a few more examples would be nice."
4,This is a good textbook for beginners as well as experts.,"This is a good book for those who already had some experience with Java programming, but wants to know the design issues and other more deeper issues in Java and other programming languages. The graphics are very helpful. The practice examples are excellent and challenging. The CD-ROM that came with the book isn't the best JDK out there because it is controlled by Microsoft, those Communists!"
4,Genuinely usefull,It is worth to have waited for 10 days for the bookIt covered up to date java technology and provide additional informations about the implementations of algorithms in real life.I got many usefull java and algorithm theories from this book and I think it fits to people who want to learn java and the other who have java knowledge.
3,"Hundreds of typos, and authors apparently don't want to know","I'm finding the 4th edition reasonably clear and comprehensive. However, the book is teeming with typographical errors. Most of them are typesetting errors involving superscripts and subscripts that overlap the adjacent characters so they aren't fully legible. But there are numerous other miscellaneous typos.So, I've been marking them in my copy, in order to submit them to the authors or publisher, but apparently they don't want to know about the typos. The ""errata"" section at java.datastructures.net contains no errata and no instructions on how to submit errata. I wrote to one of the authors to ask how to submit errata, but received no reply."
1,This book is useless,"I was required to purchase this book for a second-semester data structures class. It is totally useless to me. There are very few Java examples, and the few examples they do have are very poor examples. The author's website is just as useless as the book. I tried to access the student hint server quite a few times and always came away with nothing. I always get a message saying ""Sorry, no hint available for this exercise"". If you want a good book covering data structures check out Data Structures and Algorithms in Java by Mitchell Waite ISBN 1-57169-095-6. We used this book in my first-semester Data Structures course. It covers everything in detail and also gives detailed source code. It costs less than Goodrich & Tamassia's Data Structures book, is twice the size of their book, it covers everything that their book covers, and comes with a cd containing sample applets that demonstrate the concepts you are learning as well as the source code for all programs in the book."
1,Ostentatiously Bad,"This book, as many have said, is used in numerous introductory courses in computer science. It was recently dropped by my college after it was disowned by the professors who chose it -- we students threw so much scorn on the book no one wanted to admit they had anything to do with it.The book has a very idiosyncratic style. It likes to use some unnecessarily specific class and method names for its examples (e.g. The authors create a binary node class -- BTNode -- for you and then never use it, but go back to their BTPosition class) and fails nearly every time when it attempts to justify certain proofs about big-O and algorithm runtimes. In fact, the authors seem to think it adequate to make a broad statement and then give a simple example.All in all, you're best finding webpages written by random professors than purchasing this morass."
2,Not good for your first exposure to data structures,"I just completed my first course in data structures using this text. I do not recommend it if you are trying to solidify the Java you learned in your first programming course. It's very sparse on details. I recommend Main's text instead.On the other hand, I would look at this book AFTER you've completed your data structures course. I think you get the ""big picture"" of basic data structures. I would also recommend this book to anyone who is mathematically mature (ie comfortable with abstract thinking) and needs a quick overview of data structures.To summarize, I wouldn't use this as a required text for a course. If your instructor uses this for a course, check it out from the library and buy a copy of Main's text instead."
2,Not bad - fairly thorough sampling of the topic - No SOURCE,"My only real problem with this very complete book is a the lack of source code. They offer a class library off of their web site that allows you to test some data structures, but without source code, you are left to guess what they did and why. Repeated attempts to get access to the source code to the basic data structures they describe in the book were ignored. Attempts to contact Wiley (the publisher) were also ignored. Good luck on this one. The CD-ROM comes with a scaled back version of Microsoft's Visual J++ 1.1, this is ok, but a bit out of date. There is no source code with the book."
3,"Not bad, not great either","Not enough real code examples to show concepts this book is easy to read, but you'll have to read some things over to understand it completely"
2,More faults than the Pacific Rim,"After being forced into purchasing this textbook for a course at my school I made a major mistake. I actually memorized the psudeo code for many of the algorithms, so I could use the code on my exams. Unfortunetely after my exams, I found out that most of the code I had learned from this book was completely wrong! In some cases the code doesn't even work. In others the code does the actual exact opposite from what the comments describe. This book has an errata sheet 12 pages long, and it should not be ignored. This text cost me several critical marks on a couple of exams, and that is simply inexcuseable. Just because most software is full of bugs, doesn't mean that the books on how to write code should be too."
1,Data Structures and Algorithms in Java,"This text is one of the most poorly written I have read on the subject of data structures. The JAVA overview should be removed since it goes into no real details pertinent to data structures, and uses a grammar to define the language which serves to confuse more than assist in learning. I suppose they felt they needed to be different from other texts in some way to sell... how about writing a clear readable text with good code examples? There is apparently no code in the text which is compilable (only code fragment) and obvious errors in some of these code fragments. The writing and questions are ambiguous and unclear in many places. I don't see why any university would choose to use this text. Maybe the publisher is giving kickbacks to the department?!? You could spend your money more wisely... such as on Sedgewick's Algorithms in C++, and a JAVA text such as Deitel and Deitel as a resource instead..."
5,Data Structures & Algorithms in Java,The Java book is excellent to read and understand steps needed to learn Java programming. I would recommend it to everyone!
5,One of the Best Data Structure Book,"Data Sturctures and Algorithms in Java is a great book for a Data Structure class for CS student. I go to a school where data structures is taught in C++. But i used this book to learn about most data structures. The explanations are very clear and detailed. I did not use the source code from this book as i had to program in C++ , however I used this book more than my assigned course book . I still use this book as reference . I really liked the chapter on Complexity . Very good explanation .This book covers all the topics in detail. I think it is a must for every CS student to have."
3,Entertaining but inaccurate,"I thought the writing was relatively entertaining and the book was a smooth read, except for the parts where I got hung up on inaccuracies. I started out giving Mr. Pollack the benefit of the doubt, since he was trying to survey so many different religions, I understood that there wouldn't be a lot of depth. He often describes what takes place at a ritual without giving us a clue why anything occurs. A few actually useful pictures would have been helpful, particulary since his description of a yin/yang symbol is incorrect. He clearly didn't do deep research in an number of areas -- his section on ""Sorcery"" is from the HeroQuest gaming system. Judging from his description of Wicca (in which he doesn't mention Gerald Gardner!), he seems to take one subgroup's rituals and attributes them to an entire belief system. If you read this one, do it with a grain of salt."
2,Not very good..,I always hate doing this to an author but I almost didn't finish this book due to it's dryness. Avoide this outline.
4,Innovative new Japanese taiko drumming,"It's difficult to capture the power of Japanese taiko drumming through any recorded medium -- if you're not right there in the room with your bones vibrating as the big drums pound in unison... Well, it just ain't the same. That's one reason, along with the eventual need to innovate, that taiko albums often have crossover elements woven in alongside the drumming. This long-lived Japanese ensemble, formed in 1969, roves far and wide on its latest record, incorporating traditional shamisen lute and the shakuhachi bamboo flute on some numbers, and a wild, free-jazz saxophone on others, some vocals, a tune or two from the West. There are also several songs with pure, fast taiko drumming -- rippling, dense, creative arrangements that must be thrilling to see live, but sound pretty nice on disc as well."
5,Great for Notecards & Notebooks,"I write math formulas on the inside over of my notebook. The 'fine point' markers are too fat for this, but these 'ultra fine point' markers are just right. I can also use them to write in my notebook without having them go though several sheets of paper."
5,Sharpies Rock,I like Sharpies a lot and these pens don't disapoint. Yes there's a few useless colors but my overall impression is 100% positive. The permanent nature of this ink is highly desireable.
4,"Like the markers, but they don't match the picture","I love Sharpies in general and like the fine point and variety of colors on these. However I just wanted to let people know you may or may not get the ""Caribbean colors"" shown in this picture. I bought this exact item but received ""80's Glam"" colors. They're still decent, but if you're looking for something very specific it's good to be aware of. (note: as of 10/27 it looks like they've updated the listing to reflect ""80's glam"" - so it's been fixed - just be cautious when ordering these specialty colors).Note as of 1/10/12: looks like it's been updated again, now to the regular colors. They must re-use this same listing for many differnet color varieties. I'd just be cautious when ordering and prepared to return for the 'right' colors if need be (might be worth printing off the page when you order)."
3,Too brief but interesting,"Book was too brief, but interesting--wish there had been more explicit description of Church's rectors (both head and assistant's)--how they led parish and what accomplishments they achieved in their years at St. Paul's."
4,By far Griffin's best novel.,"On a passenger ship transporting emigrants from Britain and Italy to Australia, the story begins in Naples, Italy, where the protagonist, Ciccolanti, takes up his duty as 1st officer. Drama unfolds in the Indian ocean as the Captain dies, leaving the inexperienced Ciccolanti as shipmaster (the original title of this book). As the vessel gets trapped in a cyclone, enmity between the Italian and Britsih passengers climaxes, resulting in a run on the lifeboats. The only thing that detracts from this masterpiece is Griffin's blatant anti-British sentiment, that, in its virulence, almost begs ridicule."
2,Uncomfortable,"These shoes were a little too purple for me and they were not comfortable at all. They did not have any kind of good support, which is disappointing for Rockport."
5,Old school,"Even though I know that padded inverted dimple paddles are the highest quality and the choice of top competitors, I grew up playing against my fellow tennis team players playing ping pong on rainy days and before and after practice at school. In those days the school provided sandpaper paddles and we got pretty darn good with those things. Now I simply prefer the feel and action of the hard wood and sandpaper feel. This paddle is that classic style. My vacation resort home bought a first class $500 ping pong table for the recreation room and of course they bought quality paddles. So I had to go out and buy this $7 sandpaper paddle to have for myself. It's just like I remember."
2,Using an analog radio,I had forgotten how much trouble it was to turn an analog radio. I will not buy another one if a digital one is available.
2,sound is good but does not balance well on my head,"sound is good but does not balance well on my head - is it bad design or is my head shape and size non-standard?the prob is, until you take it out of the clamshell packaging and try it on, you won't know if it will fit you - if it doesn't, you can't return it to the store!I bought this model for about $24 at J&R;, the retail store."
3,So expensive?,My Sony Optimus headset finally wore out. I can't believe the cost to replace it with a new Sony SRFH4. Was hoping to be able to be in the $70 max range.
3,NO PRESETS/NO CLOCK,"I have the Sony MODEL # SRF-HM22 with 5 preset fm and 5 am buttons and a clock. This is great but it is a few years old.We were hoping to find same specifications even tho it would cost more. Advantage to presets: when walking and listening, so easy to change stations without looking! The clock is also a definite plus. Wonder why Sony no longer makes this available."
1,Used to cost $20.,This is a great radio headset that I have purchased for my sepcial needs son on numerous occasions and I have never paid more than $20 for them! Who do these folks think they are asking so much for this product?
2,disappointing,"I bought this to use with my nano and fm transmitter. Used them just once, these headphones are huge, bulky, and kept falling off my head. I felt like an alien robot. Bit the bullet and went bluetooth."
1,Don't buy this,"Don't waste your money on this. I didn't notice when ordering that this is analog-to tune to a radio station, you have to try to see through a tiny yellow window and look at the dial as you try to find a station. I didn't know that radios with dials like this were even made any more. You have to go through that process each time you want to change stations. The last headphones I had like this were digital and a touch of the button changed stations. The reception is lousy, too-turn your head the wrong way and you lose the signal. get a digital set as I'm going to do after I throw these out."
2,Headphone radio,"Sony SRFH4 Analog Tuning AM/FM Headphone Radio:I would not recommend this product. I was very disappointed in the product. It did not clearly pick up several stations that I always listen to. I was very pleased with the quick response and delivery of the product from Amazon, just not the product. I even considered sending it back but wasn't quite sure how to do that.Joyce Hartenstein"
3,Reception Problems,"This headset radio is comfortable and has clear sound. However, unlike the older Sony model I had for 10 years, this new one has a tendency to lose reception sporadically, cutting in and out. I find I have to either turn it off and back on again to get it going, or wait until I hike around a bend in the road. The older model got better reception."
1,too much of a bargain?,"The quality of sound for $19.99 is just fine. However, I've had the product only two weeks and I need to arrange to send it back for a replacement. The tiny clasp that tightens the thin headband has no tension in it, so it can't be shaped to fit my head. And now something is wrong with the electronics: 5 to 20 minutes after turning it on, a growling/buzzing sound appears in the background and grows gradually louder until it drowns out the music."
2,looks better than it is.,An inexpensive unit with fair sound quality and comfort.I am still looking for a unit that does it all at any reasonable price.
3,Good renditions,"Good renditions of Dive and Lazarus, the main selections I wanted.I DO NOT HAVE NINE MORE WORDS TO OFFER YOU."
2,Title is Misleading,"Judging from this book's title I was hoping for some good examples of programming with MFC. While I found this book to be complete and thourough in its information, it was disapointing with its lack of concrete examples. This is not the book for you if you are looking for step by step instruction to learn MFC programming techniques by example. The only reason much of this book made sense to me is because I have already been using MFC on and off for a couple years. The examples provided leave the user to make too many decisions and are vague. There is no rescue if you get backed in to a corner."
1,Not very useful,"This book is very dismal in presentation. Not an interesting read at all. The author tries to cram too much stuff into the chapters haphazardly. It is very painful to grasp the thread of what the topic is trying to tell you, when poorly organized. I bought this book with an intention to gain knowledge on MFC usage, but so far no gain. It could be done better."
3,Super Bowl XXXIX - New England Patriots Championship Video,"Pretty good. In addition to the post-season and Superbowl recaps, the DVD also features highlights from all the regular season games. And one of the bonus features is the Superbowl game itself (edited for huddles, timeouts, etc. but keeping in significant replay videos and the like). Now, I find these DVDs are always short on some things; it's hard to please regular fans, especially those of the Superbowl winner. But this offering has its place, especially with Pats fans. They will find it entertaining and worth the price."
5,NE Patriots Super Bowl 34,This is the best of the 3 super bowls the patriots won. this is the one to buy. Bob Ganno
4,Fabulous Catalogue,This is a wonderful example of an exquisite collection of Chinese Export Porcelain sold 30 years ago. The condition of the catalogue was perfect and it came home just in a couple of days. Very good service.
5,a easy readable and funny book!!,"I just recently found ""what's it all about"" in a secondhands shop in holland, were I live.( the book is called ""waar gaat het allemaal om""in holland). I found it joyfull to read about sir Michael Caine's live in his own words. I do think he is a real good whriter! he is funny and his work is easy to read. it is very hard to lay the book down!! sascha"
3,Good,My daughter is 19 months . She loves her little horse . She found it under the Christmas tree and it was perfect
5,Kid's favorite!,Bought this for my 10-year-old horse fanatic - she loves it and plays with it every day! The horse is of fairly good quality although after a few weeks of play one of the seams ripped.
3,Expected...,OK... this is just your average motion picture 'score'. What I want to know is - where is the SOUNDTRACK with all of the other music? That is what I'm looking to see released!
1,Rather disappointing,"Original motion picture score yeah great, why release a soundtrack that doesn't contain the songs from the movie.When people say 'hey this is good ill buy the soundtrack' you expect it to have those catchy songs you know like papa roach and limp bizkit and the other's you dont know but you like, getting the soundtrack being half the reason to find out what those unknown songs are.Poor, very poor !"
1,Confused,I was looking foward to getting the soundtrack but where is all the songs I heard in the movie? None of these songs have lyrics!
1,??,"What the?? Why didn't they put any of the goodmusic off the movie? The rock was a welcome break from the weak and poorly done overtures and theme music. The movie had great music, where is it??"
1,Where is the soundtrack with the songs from the movie?,I don't even remember the score to this movie. I do remember the great rock songs that were in it though. That is the music I'm looking for. Not the muscial score!
4,Most definitely one of his best and most fun...,"Trevor Rabin has always stuck out of most other composers simply because of his one-of-a-kind style. He just can't seem to get the rock star out of him...which is great! His music for Armegeddon and Deep Blue Sea was fantastic..and certainly doesn't dissapoint you here.But, believe it or not, if you don't like loud, electric guitar rock and a lot of synth...this CD is not for you. A good chunk of this album, if not all of it, is very loud,awesome, rocking out guitar and drums. Fitting for a futuristic Jet Li action flick.I really enjoy this score...it's a lot of fun to listen to. Rabin should continue to write music like this."
5,"A tight game, regardless of being 2D","This is the best arcade game I have played since ""Strikers 1942,"" it mixes a cool soundtrack, vivid colors, and action together without so much as a single hiccup. The gameplay is addictive, and the 30 levels go from the early 1900's up through WW2, the Vietmnam War, and into the future. Plus, Baron von Schtopwatch is always cracking things at you, such as: ""I just vant to take over ze vorld. Is that zo wrong!?""This game is a sure five-star winner. Good entertainment for the generation of younger children. Amazingly, this shooter contains none of the following:Blood, gore, profanity, and jetlag. This game is one of Freeverse's most succesful programs."
4,A Shortened Commentary,"This is a compromise volume as it is truncated from the three volumes that are the gold strandard of Matthew commentaries. Sometimes it is too shortened! But good at the price.Excellent judgments about the interpretation of Matthew, sorting through the scholarship. Good for the general reader."
3,Late delivery,Products arrived in great condition however much later than expected and not in time for Christmas. I guess next time I will have to order much earlier.
1,U.S. editing has botched this series,I recommend that you stay away from this set. American green eye shades from A&E's advertizing department cut ten-twelve minutes from each episode so that they could squeeze more fast food ads in to the showings on television. The resulting botch makes several of these episodes unwatchable. Sorry; hopefully Acorn will put these out in pristine form.
1,Poirot with minutes cut out for ads,"Thanks for the heads up,Ixion28, on the A&E version of the series. I have only seen the Poirot series on A&E, and I like it enough to purchase the DVD sets. However, I was disappointed to find out that A&E cut out minutes for ads. I am checking into the AcornMedia version."
2,Marred by mistakes,"I am a high school English teacher, and I have used and been pleased with Collins's unit plan for Huck Finn. I bought this one hoping that it would be equally useful. Unfortunately, I found that it contains several mistakes. The true/false quiz for Act I, for example, contains at least two clear errors (One statement says that Abigail is Parris's daughter and another says that Tituba is Proctor's slave, and these are not meant to be false statements). I gave that quiz to my class without previewing it carefully enough, and there were several disputed answers. I had to promise them not to use the quizzes from this source again! I have found mistakes in other places, too, and I was bothered by Collins's biased tone at times. Some of the material still looks useful, but I am dubious of it now."
5,The Title Says it all,This is a must have for any white belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It goes over the fundamental elements of virtually every technique that one would use on the journey to blue belt. I watched these over and over prior to my test. It truly was the best resource other than the instructor himself. Various views are used and the techniques are described in such a way that one can really use these to fine tune or even learn these fundamental skills. I can't wait for the Purple Belt Requirements dvds.
2,Very short video for price,"I was reading the reviews for different bjj videos and one reviewer said that this was the best. I disagree. The things it taught were good fundamentals, but it was very short and only went over a few things. That being said, it was well produced and taught, but it was not worth what I paid. this is worth maybe $12.99 and I paid $40 plus"
4,content is great... the intros are a little lengthy,"I'll keep it simple. 3 stars for the actual quality of the disc. It feels FLIMSY. You'll see when you get it. I don't know if there are different versions, but my first set was so flimsy, it go caught in my laptop drive and I had to get it replaced. 5 stars for Amazon service and content of the disk. THe info is well organized and gets right into the basics of submissions, escapes, and chokes. Nothing complicated. Just pure technique. If you are after basics and want to strengthen the fundamentals. This 2 disk DVD set is for you."
4,Escapes didn't work in judo,Great introduction to basic BJJ. The section for escapes are literally impossible to pull off (at least in my judo practice) when the opponent is really trying (his partner's loose mounts on him in the video is almost laughable). I've never done any BJJ in real life but I have done judo for 3 years and nobody in newaza sessions would mount me so loosely as demonstrated in the video. Never the less it's still a great introduction DVD to BJJ.
3,Way Too Few Techniques for Price,"The video and audio quality are very good, but there are only a handful of techniques. Most blue belts in Jiu Jitsu I know have a ton more techniques in their repertoire. I was seriously disappointed by how few techniques Roy has in this dvd set. It's shameful.I hope he does a better blue belt version in the near future and offers a discount to those who bought this one."
3,BJJ info,Liked the concept and the idea however the processes could be better explained and how they apply or build upon each other. It's still a very good series and can give new perspective on your game.
5,Don't be a victim of Fraud,"A customer who finds an unbelievably cheap price of the market seller must know:1)They want you to contact them before ordering2)They want you to send money not thru Amazon payment but thruthe other line, such as Western Union3)They return confirmation email to you such as ""support@amazon.com"" or ""Amazon Customer Service [THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS). A customer will surely believe that it was from Amazon. Yet, if you check your email, you may find that your sent-email to ""support@amazon.com"" failed to be sent.4) Once you send your money to them thru Western Union as they suggested, your money is gone!5) BE CAREFUL! Only pay resonable price and thru directly Amazon."
4,One of the best values now for a highly-rated plasma,"This TV has a great picture with a DVD source! Remarkably better than the (old) Sony 32""XBR it replaced. For cable sources I prefer the Sony for a few reasons. First, most cable sources are 4:3 ratio and the picture is about the same size on this TV. Second, when looking at a 4:3 source with the grey bars on the sides I worry about (but haven't seen) burn-in. All-in-all it is a good purchase, lots of options for aspect ratio, color adjustment,and inputs (including computer)."
4,An enjoyable sequel,"The continuation of the intriguing story ""Life Probe"", although set a few hundred years after the fact. ""Procyon's Promise"" is fast paced and manages not to insult the readers intelligence, yet gives enough scientific reasoning behind quantum mechanics for even a novice in the field of mathematics to grasp his meanings. Although definitely not the `great American novel' this book is witty, intelligent, all encompassing, and reasonably toned down. I must confess I liked the book enough that I sat down for 5 hours and read strait through it."
1,Bad Habits,"This program tries to simplify the process of learning guitar and as aresult doesn't teach you anything but bad habits. The chords theyteach are simplified structures that are sometimes taught to childrenwhose hands aren't big enough to reach the proper positions. Theessence of beggining guitar is learning to stretch your hands to chordproperly and finger memory-getting to the point where your fingers hitthe chords without having to think about it. By teaching simplifiedchords and such, your time is wasted. You can quickly play a song butit doesn't sound right and you'll need to re-learn all yourchords."
2,Not Worth the Money,"In trying the eMedia Guitar Method 1, I did not expect perfection or the highest quality production. My expectations were unpleasantly accurate, therefore. The software boasts about several songs you will easily learn. The songs, however, are simplified, dummed-down versions of the originals and anything but cool sounding. The poor sound quality (instructor only uses an acoustic, and the lyrical track is recorded much louder than the guitar) and simplicity of programming design leave the consumer unsatisfied. Although the program does present an easy way to learn a few chords and how to strum a guitar, one is better off saving the $49.95 and visiting the local public library."
3,"Excellent Markers, Horribly Strong Odor","These markers write very well. The tips are perfect for fine writing and the colors are vibrant. The big problem I found is that the odor is just too strong. You almost need to use these with a strong breeze. Frankly, it is nauseating. I use these markers on a small, portable dry-erase board so my face is closer to being above the markers than than if I were to use them on a wall-mounted board. So this may contribute to the intensity of the smell."
1,Blue Markers Stain the Board,"I just mounted my new white board and tried out the four markers in this package. Three of them work just fine, although they have a pretty strong odor. The blue one didn't work at first, and then when it did the color came out blotchy. When I went to erase it, it didn't erase; it just turned a big part of the board a watery blue. I have tried repeatedly to remove the color with white-board cleaner, but I can't get it all out.I had bought two packs of these, so I tried out the second pack just to see if the first one I got was defective. I had the same problem; black, red and green work fine, but the blue stains the board. Clearly, this is not a one-off defect.I'm amazed. Sanford Expo is the leading brand for white-board supplies. It's hard to believe that they would ship a product that not only doesn't work but that does damage instead. That's a real trust-breaker. Hey, Sanford -- are you reading these reviews?"

4,"No Way, You People Are ON CRACK!","There is no way I'm spending that kind of money for one wrestling ppv. Whoever is selling this DVD for used & new have to lower their price by $75 AT LEAST, because there is something seriously wrong with you if you think I'm gonna spend that kind of money for one wrestling ppv DVD."
4,WHAT!?!?!?,"You're kidding me.You must be INSANE if you're crazy enough to buy this.Sure, I have this PPV (I got it for free because my friend Zack ordered the PPV back in 2002 and taped it).All I have to say is that if you're planning on buying this PPV for that crazy price of $100 or more is that it's not worth it.Maybe if it was $30, but not $100.Anyways pretty much the only matches worth the money is Austin vs. Flair & Big Show and HHH vs. Jericho HIAC (Hell In A Cell)"
3,"Interesting book, but needs editing","James Durney has given us an interesting examination of the Irish situation from the local perspective of the County Kildare. While one might not envision Kildare as a hotbed of Republican activity- like Cork, Dublin, Armagh, Derry- it gave some heroes to the struggle for Irish independence and, of course, is the home to the Curragh, the site of the famous Curragh mutiny in 1914 and the later internment of Republican political prisioners. While adding to our knowledge of the Republican movement, On The One Road needs a good editor. The text wanders at times and could use greater focus."
1,"Um, No.","If you've had sex more than twice, no once you've done all of these. Very little history as one reviewer reported. And the persons doing the demonstrations: I give them credit for chosing a 'real' looking couple (woman with cellulite, not completely rippped guy) however the guy looks like he could be her dad (twice her age)! I'm hoping that this was a true couple because otherwise it's just really creepy!!! Not worth the money at all!!!!!"
3,Liverpool Fans Will Enjoy; DVD Fans May Not Enjoy.,"Being a Liverpool supporter, I enjoyed watching all of the great goals in the FA Cup throughout the years all on one DVD. However, the picture perhaps was not as good as it good have been. Of course, some of this footage was aged but there are ways to remaster and technologically improve such footage. The audio also was not as good as it probably should have been either. But if you are an American Liverpool fan who doesn't have a multi-region or universal region DVD player, this DVD should satisfy your needs."
3,Sharpie pen disappointment,"I was very disappointed in these pens. I bought then because they were Ultra Fine Point pens. I have bought these pens in the store in clam shell packaging and they were much finer. I looked at each pen to make sure they were listed correctly om the pen and they were. I cannot use for what I intended, but you will always have a need for a Sharpie around the house."
5,Perfect for Labeling DVDs and CDs,"I have used the Sharpie Fine Point Permanent Markers for years to write on DVD's on the label side of the disk.They work perfectly, dry quickly and don't smudge when you write on DVD's.If you need a marker to write on CDs or DVDs, buy these."
4,Nice Fine Point Pen,"If you need a very fine point marker, or just a fine point pen, these are nice. One downfall is that you MUST replace the cap after every use, or it will dry out immediately! I like Sharpies and these are very fine point and useful for marking objects with precision or even just writing. The box of 12 is a bargain, but too many, so I split a box of with family members."
4,Not locally available,"I use different point sizes of Sharpie markers. I use quite a bit of both red and black colors. I couldn't find a box of just red markers at the local Office Max or Staples so I ordered it from Amazon. As you might guess, I like the markers."
3,Too much ink.,"This review is sort of outside the star system, it should just serve as an advisory, as I'm sure these pens are great for many uses.HOWEVER...I was searching for a cheaper alternative to more expensive drawing pens for everyday writing. These pens seems to put out a lot of ink, which results in spotty bleeding, even in a notebook with reasonably heavy paper. The pen tip is also slightly thicker than advertised."
1,NOT for use on paper,"Maybe just my mistake of not knowing what sharpies are for, but do not count on these to use on paper. They will bleed through, even so far as to mark the page underneath the one you are writing on. No way you can use 2 sides of the same sheet of paper!As mentioned by someone else, these are NOT EVEN CLOSE to being .02. Maybe .07 or even thicker. I will try to return them as not as advertised.So these may work for writing on CDs or DVDs, but do not buy them to use for normal writing on paper."
2,We know what Sharpies do...,"I ordered three boxes of these Sharpies for use in my high school art class. At least three in every box did not work, i.e. the ink was dried out. That was quite disappointing, as I ordered boxes of 12 expecting to be able to put all of them to use."
2,Box says 12 and I only received 11,"Sharpie are great - but when you order little items like this, you dont expect it to get it wrong.I got so dissappointed that the box is suppose to come with a dozen pens and my box only came with 11 pens.Its annoying when its so small but it seem like quality control of having the correct amount is not there."
5,Great Pens!!,"Pens work great and a great economical value to add!! Everyone should have gotten in on the deal!! Thanks, Amazon!!"
3,"Good markers, wrong details!","These markers work just fine, but the description says they are a .2mm This is just wrong. It says nothing about the measurement on the box or the markers and when compared to pencil lead, they are probably closer to a .7mm at the tip, but like most markers, will make a somewhat larger line. If you truly want a super fine maker, check out Pigma Micron 005..."
5,Wonderful for those of us with low vision,"I can barely see ball point ink on paper these days, and forget about pencil output. That's why I use Sharpies. Both fine and these ultra fines are the only pens I use. Shopping lists, notes, addressing envelopes, and writing checks are all do-able for me with a Sharpie. Life would be harder if I could not get them so thank goodness once again for Amazon."
1,Do not waste your time,"It took well over an hour just to remove the parts from the packaging.The diagram of the parts and how they fit together was impossible to figure out at least for this Ga. Tech Engineer. The parts had no markings to correlate to the schematic. I realized I did not need this desk, loaded it into my SUV and hauled it to the dump.You should beware of buying this product. WS Britton"
5,A Great Story that shows real feelings!,"I thought this story gave a great incite to what Paul Revere's family must have felt about the Revolution and the Sons of Liberty. Sarah, his daughther, goes through many mixed feelings, but discovers herself at the end."
4,A different perspective on a well known part of US history.,"I read this book on vacation when I ran out of my own books (and was unable to buy any others) and grabbed one of my daughter's books. It was very interesting to have a different take on the story of Paul Revere, one that not only gave new insights into life in the Boston area at that time, but one that would also speak specifically to ideas of importance to young girls. Okay, the teenage heart throb issue did not appeal much to me, by my ten-year-old enjoyed it immensely."
4,The Secret of Sarah Revere,"Student Review- Sara Revere, the daughter of the famous patriot, Paul Revere recalls the journeys her father had made for the past two years.Historical significant takes place, such as the Boston Tea Party and her fathers ""famous rides."" Ann Rinaldi's writing technique of this wonderful story may be confusing at times, but it all comes together in the end.The use of all the incidents that has happened in the past makes the novel very involving but very informative at the same time. It is a great way to take yourself back in the history of the Revolutionary War."
4,Secret of Sarah Revere,"Secret of Sarah Revere is about Paul Revere's daughter, Sarah. A man comes to the door of the Revere household. He asks Sarah of the happenings of the Revere family in the past year. Sarah begins to think of the last year or so. You will have to read the book to find out all of her thoughts.I really liked this book because it has a story and a history lesson. You really need to have some knowledge of that time period to understand what is going on.This book is good for a male or female, but mostly female because it is a female telling the story. I hope you enjoy the book as much as i did! Hope this reveiw helped."
3,Flower Reviews...,"Recently I've been going through a box of old books my neighbors gave me and I came across this. I finished this in less than one day, and was satisfied with me. Most books make history seem all dull and prim and proper, but this one brought out the troubles of the Revoloution as you don't learn in the classroom. Though some parts I zoned out, it was not boring, like many historic accounts are. This book was an enjoyable read!"
3,Hoped for more,"I recently bought an Ace CD for the song ""How long"" and thought I'd listen to other music they put out. Although there are a few tunes I can listen to, most I did not like but I have not been a huge fan beyond that one song which brings back memories of my younger days and love it to this day."
1,beware,"This is a very cheap paddle, and I think, not worth the price. You'd be better off getting a cheaper pips-in paddle and putting your own over-wrap on the handle."
1,already falling apart,"not a big fan of these paddles, as the both the grip and the padding are already coming apart and i have only had the paddles for a few weeks."
2,This product ruined my life,"Read the title. Quite frankly, id rather be left to wallow in my own disgust at the gratuitous misinformation presented about this most heinous of 2mm sponge paddles than go into the details of how it ruined my love life, killed my close family and resulted in the decenstruction of every institution i hold dear. Good weight though, quite easy to use."
1,h,The MP3 compression makes this recording unlistenable. So much 'surface' noise or audible interferenceWe used to have the CD and that had good quality. Proabably will not buy anything from MP3 again.
5,Gorgeous Mozart music,Mozart at Midnight is a beautiful album. It is worth buying. I love Mozart and this CD was just great. I only wish that it had come in a jewel case.
4,I would purchase these again...,"Pro's:Markers are lower odor than older dry erase markers.Markers are a little shorter than others so they more easily fit into storage containers.Black erases well off of white board surfaces.Con's:Colors other than black erase poorly from whiteboard surfaces, that is why I purchased these markers in an all black set.Markers run out fairly rapidly.I would purchase these markers again as they are one of the best options out there, however I will avoid using the colored versions of these markers as it is too much trouble to clean the board with liquid cleaner after every use."
3,They don't last...,Expo markers write great when fresh. Within a day they begin to fade quickly. The bullet tip markers flatten out quickly even with little pressure. Is there a better alternative out there? Maybe. But I have not found it yet. Expo please make your markers last longer.
2,Disappointing quality,"I have to say these markers really don't measure up to the quality expected from this manufacturer. The points are flattened after just a couple hours' use - and I'm not a ""lead finger"" user. Hopefully I will be able to find alternate markers soon as a box of these are worthless after just a few days."
3,An interesting book about a foal being born,"This book uses photogaphs to show how a foal is born, witch I think is very interesting. Then it shows you how a foal learns to walk and play with his mother."
4,Wacky cheesy fun,A great piece of 80's history. This cheesy wrestling cartoon is a scream throughout. The antics of a badly drawn Hulk Hogan mixed with rock and roll--please....a great way to remember the old days when wrestling was fun and not oversexed homophobic misogyny.
1,No answer key,"I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The book contained no answer key to check to see if I grasped the concepts in each chapter. There was no way to check my work. I wish I had not spent the money on this book."
3,A Book,"Though this is a good book, I wouldn't buy it if it wasn't required by the class I am taking. It doesn't really explain much, and I assume that is because they assume it is just a refresher."
1,Major Disappointment,"This book was required for a Computer Forensics related class. There are many errors, not just typographical, but in concepts and technical information. At times it is filled with a mind-numbing number of details, much of which will be obsolete by the time you read this. In other areas it skips over important concepts leaving you lost.If you're hoping to learn more about network security you're better off looking elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"After browsing it twice, I finally put it down.It's very introductive, simple and not well-written to a newbie.It doesn't cover that much on Checkpoint...The rest you can get it from the Internet."
1,"This book is a joke, I got more laughs than good information.",It is unreal how bad this book is. It states simple concepts incorrectly throughout. The terminology and presentation is simplistic at best. I am a Networking Professional and a Network Security student. I knew more before I read this book and was left a bit confused afterward. It even claims that IDS impact network traffic negatively and discusses proper placement to mitigate it. I refuse to trust the Pearson line of tech books again.
2,Strap on your tinfoil hat!,"I don't own this DVD but watched the original episode on the History Channel. It's ludicrous conspiracy theory stuff right out of the Area 51 school, but even worse, it lacks the entertaining campiness that shows like this usually contain."
5,Great Sax-Man,"We never heard of Dan Traxler but one Sunday here in Gray Court SC we went to the Church of God and the Pastor was and still is Dan Traxler! We told him how much we enjoy his music and after Church he gave us a CD entitled together..Classic Gospel and when we heard ""Amazing Grace"" my wife almost ran thru the house she had the spirit hit her. So happy that God sent a man that can touch so many in so many different ways. Buy the CD your soul will be blessed!!"
1,not clear,do not buy if you are planning on using it with 64 bit.NO GOOD!this is not disclosed in any location when shopping for it!
1,Item did not work,"I had tried another digital receiver prior to purchasing the Plextor receiver. The previous receiver worked very well except it got very hot after only 30 minutes of use, so I returned it. The plextor receiver was rated very well so I purchased it. I liked the design as it had vents built in to allow for cooling, however, the cable/antenna connection was flimsy. Unfortunately, the unit did not work. The installation cd did not match the installation steps identified in the accompanying manual so I was not able to identify why the unit was not working. It would not recieve a signal, even when connected to an antenna that I knew received digital stations. There was no feature available on the menu to assist with trouble shooting the problem. I attempted to contact the Plextor website tech support, but it indicated that it is not yet available. I returned the product."
2,Did not work,"Did not work on any computer. I gave it a 2 only because I can use the digital antennae on my HDTV to get over the air HD, on channels my cable company does not carry in HD. Pretty expensive for this use, but not a total loss."
3,Good Until It Stopped Working,"This unit worked quite well in New York City with antenna placed in window. I received many channels and pictures were excellent on 19 inch PC LCD monitor. However, after a few months, without changing anything, the unit just stopped working. The unit has a one year warranty, but trying to return the unit for repair or replacement was useless. Evidently tech support cannot read or understand English very well."
3,Not For Mac,"I got very excited when I read about this product online. But I missed the small print and saw there's a 3GHz CPU requirement for HD on the Amazon review below. Plus, I checked to see it's a Windows(R)-only device. Sorry Mac OS users. Otherwise, it's genius! So, perhaps I'll wait for version 2.0."
3,CPU Requirement,Plextor's website says you need at least a 3Mhz CPU to get high definition (1 Mhz for standard definition).
4,A great item no longer made by Plextor,"It's unfortunate that Plextor no longer makes this unit because it is super. Outside of my not understanding that in WIN7 you must set it up and view it through Windows Media Center (Plextor info did not explain this, which made set-up very confusing), not the included software (only the driver), this is really a great little USB device for a very reasonable price. Plextor must have stopped making it before WIN7 was on the market since I would find it hard to believe that such a great unit would be discontinued. Wonderful value for more than the money. Vendor did a superb job. I ordered on Saturday and received Monday, very well packaged. The vendor also helped me when I had difficulty getting it to work through Plextor software. Really a great vendor from whom I would buy again and again with complete confidence. I find it difficult to understand why so many did not give the product a better vote."
1,Not worth the money,"Pros: Rather fetching paperweightCons: Does not work with Windows 7, and the company does not offer any kind of support. Do not buy it unless you are running XP, and if you do decide to buy, don't spend more than 20 dollars on it. It is completely useless if you are running any version of windows after XP."
5,The title says it all.,"Get the basics of C down then this book gets you going real fast. The CodeWarrior(CW) examples on the CD need to be updated for current CW but this is easy to do. Each chapter focuses on a Mac Toolbox Manager. It's up to you to start ""playing around"" by combining different Toolboxes together. I really got alot out of the book. The author also writes for MacTech magazine every month with Dave Marks."
3,"Good, but lacking a real foundation.","Teaches Mac C, but leaves out the basics of C. I recommend getting ""Learn C on the Macintosh"", by Dave Mark instead. When you've read that, come back to this book."
4,Good video,This Hermie and friends video is a great kids DVD. A must have for teaching kids values in a fun way with fun characters. Our kids love to share these with their friends who have never seen them!
4,But too fast!,"I subscribe to everything the other reviewer writes - with one single reservation: the tempos! The conductor, Zinman, makes the orchestra very articulate and his interpretation is free for all the mannerisms by which so many other directors are killing these nice symphonies. But Zinman is too fast! He hurries over the outer movements. It is of course impressive that his orchestra can be so articulate at such a speed, but I want music, not some sport performance. Philips had a LP recording in the 70ies, Four Symphonies, conducted by Raymond Leppard, which is so much better than this, capturing the gallant style, the spirit of the rococo era. But that LP had only four symphonies..."
2,Don't get your hopes up,"I needed a quick fix for live performance with my cello and this pickup was very affordable. Well, you get what you pay for. It works, but just barely. I had to run my cello through an EQ pedal to boost the signal, which got me there, but the recreation of the sound was a little off. The bass generally didn't resonate very well and I tended to have an issue with hum (a ground loop @ 60Hz that had to be eq'd out). I've since bought a Shadow SH 955 Nanoflex Pickup and haven't looked back. The Fishman gets the job done, but expect to have to boost your signal A LOT to use it live. I'm told the preamp Fishman sells as an accessory will solve all the problems I had, but for the cost of both of them you can get a Shadow pickup or another one of the competitors."
5,You need a preamp...!,"I have owned one of these for several years. If you don't use suitable preamp of some kind then the sound will be unbalanced and more than likely thin, scratchy and nasal, particularly when bowing. These are popular pick-ups and for good reason, but you need to pay attention to the rest of the set-up. For more info on pre-amps read this:[...]"
3,ok supplemental,"I really was expecting a full size book for the price here, guess I should read the fine print next time."
3,Probably only for serious Sharpe fans,"This is a brief novella, originally published as a promotional tie-in with ""Sharpe's Fortress. This book, set in summer 1812, contains several references to the main battle in ""Sharpe's Fortress,"" which occurred in 1803. The plot in ""Sharpe's Skirmish"" fits between ""Sharpe's Sword"" and ""Sharpe's Enemy."" It's about as long as 2 chapters of a normal Sharpe novel, and does have a short introduction by the author, but lacks his typical afterword on the historical setting of the book. If you're a serious Sharpe fan, you'll probably want to read ""Sharpe's Skirmish""; if you're not, there are definitely better Sharpe novels to check out."
4,A 53 page short story,"By UNESCO standards, this publication just barely qualifies as a book. It is a 53 page story plus some white pages, introduction, etc. The price may seem a bit high, but it was republished for a fundraising effort after some rewriting. The original was a limited edition publication provided as a free promotional item for a bookstore.This is a short action (skirmish) set between the time periods of two of the novels in the Sharpe series. The time is 1812. The French are retreating from Spain. The British are advancing in Northwest Spain after the Battle of Salamanca, and Sharpe is given the task of guarding a small fort on the flank of the British supply lines. All is well until the French decide to make a surprise attack. The final defense of the bridge somewhat brings to mind Harclay's defense at Boroughbridge in 1322, except Harclay had longbows. It is difficult to charge on horseback over a defended bridge."
2,"Booklet, Not a Book","As a dedicated fan of Bernard Cornwell and his riveting Sharpe series, I was extremely disappointed to discover when I received it that Sharpe's Skirmish is a booklet, not a book. It is thin beyond belief and would have made an excellent essay submitted by one of my university students as a final exam. You really should avoid disappointing fans like me and in future should make a full disclosure when you place on sale a book that really is only a booklet. Sharpe's Skirmish is so thin that when I placed it on my bookshelf with other real books it disappeared."
1,"Dissatisfied,Dissappointed","I am an absolute fan of the whole Sharpe story, but I am so so dissappointed with my purchase of Sharpes Skirmish. I thought I was getting a book but got a booklet 63 pages in total. With the cost and postage, I feel cheated and dissatisfied. I feel there should be a better description of the product and its content."
4,Still suffering from transit/transplant shock,"10/31/07I received the live banana plant (about 8"" tall in a 4"" pot) well-packed in excelsior with masking tape over the top & sides of the pot to keep the soil from falling out. Some of the leaves were damaged (crumpled) in transit, but, otherwise, it appeared very green & healthy. I transplanted the banana into a 12"" pot along with ornamental basil & echinacea plants & spread glass rocks over the soil as mulch. The pot is sitting on my back porch -- southern exposure/full sun.11/27/07Large portions of the leaves have turned brown -- & especially the leaves that were damaged in transit -- including a quarter-sized spot on the curled leaf in the center of the plant. At first, I feared the banana was dying, since it lost some of its color, but it appears to be coming back & the center leaf is slowly starting to unfurl. I've got my fingers crossed ..."
1,My poor plant,"I ordered about 7 plants from this seller, all of them were in great shape except for this one. :( The poor little plant was so squished and was browning. Sad to say it did not survive too much longer."
1,Terrible.,"I've (skeptically) ordered several plants online, mainly from Hirt's. I'd give Hirt's five stars on everything else they've sent me. This time, however, they sent me skimpy, dying plants-- This banana being the worst. I will upload my out of the box pictures after this review.The plant I received was... a pathetic, battered, tiny brown thing. I highly doubt it will survive, but I will do everything I can. Do not order from this company. I ordered three plants from them, and they were all very disappointing...Look above for my customer photo, taken immediately upon arrival."
2,Liar Liar pants on fire,"I received a 2 inch plant in a 4 inch pot. There was one dead leaf. The picture clearly states ""size you receive in a 4"" pot"". Further down, the description states you will receive an 8"" plant in a 4"" pot. Clearly fraudulent! I have included a pic of what you really get in the mail. Happy shopping..."
2,TINY MUSA BANANA PLANT,VERY TINY BANANA PLANT RECEIVED WITH ONLY TWO LEAVES AND ONE DRIED UP. NOT LIKE PICTURE. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE
1,truly tiny banana plant,i had this plant for three weeks it's already dying i even bought a humdifier and it dont now good. it is really small looks nothing like the picture i bought from hirts before and the other plants i got from them are doing good but not this one unless u know how to take care of small banana plants i would not get it
4,Is that a banana tree in your pocket?????,"Came to me pretty beat up, a little disappointing. But what do you expect shipping a tree in the mail????? A bunch of tlc and it's growing nicely. Can't wait to get banana's for my newborn sons highschool graduation party!!!!!"
4,Inma Serrano - Worth listening to,"Inma Serrano has to be one of the best singer/songwriters that I've heard from Spain in a long time. Rosas de Papel is a fantastic album with great guitar work and lyrics. Cantos de Sirena leaves me wanting for a bit more, but not a bad buy. Inma's ""Inma Serrano"" album is really exceptional - I highly recommend her if you are exploring wonderfully orchestrated Spanish pop music."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed listening to this recording of Baroque horn concertos from the Dresden court. In particular, the sound quality of the music, which was recorded in the former German democratic republic, is poor in comparison with recent similar recordings. Listen, for example, to the beautiful recording of Telemann horn concertos on D & G (Dabringhaaus & Grimm). There is no comparison. I do not recommend this recording."
1,Not exactly made for XP,I purchased this for my son because the version we owned was made for Windows 98 and had a problem with the video stuttering when installed on XP. This says it's made for XP but the copy I received was the exact made for Windows 98 version I already owned. So a warning to you if you are purchasing this for the same reason I purchased this. Although this will install and run on XP; THIS WAS NOT MADE FOR WINDOWS XP!that is all...
5,Top notch kid software,"By far the best kids program I have seen, and I have looked at quite a few.Old? Yes...and it shows...in a good way. You don't see the same level of quality and attention to detail in programming of modern kids edutainment titles.Plays on XP fine, and has a seemingly infinite amount of replayability. Voice acting is top notch.I rarely if ever say something is perfect, but I really cannot think of one negative about this title."
1,False Advertising - Will not do business with this company again.,"I bought this and two other CD-ROM's for my son. As you can see, it advertises that this is Macintosh compatible, which is not true. I have new apple computers and none of the 3 CD-ROM's I purchased work on these. I contacted the company and they refused to exchange or refund the items."
4,Dr. Seuss ABC,Great product. I was a little disappointed that it doesn't work as well as expected on a windows Vista PC. I liked it better running windows 95 & 98. Still a good product for the great grandchildren to use.
2,"had holes, runs and was not dyed right, dye had an odor","I ordered 2 sarongs a navy flower and a bright blue flower, both had some odor from the dye, both had loose strings and runs in the fabric, both had pin holes, both had edges that folded wrinkled and missed dye, I have to wash both because of the smell. The runs and pinholes will get worse I think after washing."
2,hung,"great picture, but broken comes out of the box. only hdmi works, the rest of videos and components do not work. tv is going back to Panasonic for service."
2,Welton's Review,"This book is very long, but it's very interesting.A letter was sent to Lili Spaulding from Mrs. John Bannings. Startled, she looked at more closely. No dault about ot, it was meant for her. Carter secretary must have meantto attach a note asking that he deliver it to her. The bright blue ballpaint ink had smudged over the U in Spaulding, leaving a diagonal smear across the right-hand side. She turned it over an odd feeling of dread tapping between her shoulder blades and doing her rigb cage. The flap had been neatly tucked into the envelope, itself and written on the upper left hand corner was the return address Mrs. John Banning. This book is getting bettet and better. The more I read the more curious I get. I plan to read a lot more. This was the right class for me to take.I'm going to read a lot more now. Not just in class, but on my off time too.Even at or on the road traveling."
5,Understand Prophecy and Current Events,"Chuck has a great deal of theologoical, political, and military insight which is helpful to understanding Bible prophecy. What is this book about? It covers different aspects of current events and endtime beliefs topic by topic in a logical and easy way to learn. I was very impressed with his knowledge about terrorism and the weapons they have or are trying to get."
4,Very interesting (& educational) read,"Now seriously, what could be more alluring and enticing to learn about than our own FATE? Since finding my way (back in mid-90's), this Spiritual journey has developed within me a strong sense of RESPONSIBILITY that grows in leaps and bounds from time to time. Reading PROPHECY 20/20 nudged me forward. This is simply another tool that helped me seek out and utilize TRUTH in a manner that will progress my Faith, while remaining well-grounded and functional in everyday life.PROPHECY 20/20 made things very clear of how to harmonize SCRIPTURE into my daily walk from a HISTORICAL standpoint but more than anything however, this book informed me of ""where"" we stand in GODs timetable.PROS: Gained a deeper understanding of the traditional mindset & historical reasoning behind ""some"" Middle-eastern HATERS.CONS: Invests a bit too much of his personal perspectives on International affairs."
4,"Exceptional book on Eschatology, Biblical Prophecy and Current Times","I am by no means a prophecy expert. I have read a few books on the subject though, and this is by far my favorite. I really like the way Dr Missler insists you don't take his word for it and do your own research; which I did many times. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject matter. I do wish the footnotes were at the bottom of the pages instead of the back to make referencing much easier. Because the footnotes are in the back, I wish the chapter numbers were at the top of each page. Other than that, if you are even remotely interested in biblical prophecy, you really need to check out this book."
5,Must Read!,"This book is a must read for our current day. The first couple of chapters can be a little confusing-but, keep going, With Missler's military background, it is very informative and direct. There is only One answer to our current problems...and it is found in the pages of this book."
1,Hard copy Book would have been much wiser choice,"Can't find place. Woulxnt a small page numnber on each page been so difficult? I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it,"
4,Well Researched.,"Well written, a fast easy read. Rather depressing but true. It is good to check-out differant authors for other view-points. Thanks-Ron."
3,Not what I expected,"After reading Missler's book ""Alien Encounters: The Secret Behind The Ufo Phenomenon"" I was anxious to read another one of his books. This book had a lot of good information. I guess I was expected more detail about future timelines and what needs to happen before the Jesus returns. I believe this book was written after his Alien Encounters book. So why no mention of that information in this book? I would recommend this book simply for the interesting background and details about Russia and the middle east and surrounding countries. Just don't expect an eye opening type of book like Alien Encounter...which I highly recommend by the way."
2,Very Elementary,"After reading several end time prophesy books, I was excited about reading Mr. Missler's book. I found it to be very elementary with little to nothing new on the topic. It seems as if he may need to do further reading and study to get up to date with his fellow authors on this topic. Others seem to have more information and newer insight, Mr. Missler has the information I learned a decade ago."
1,None,"Too much historical ""filler"" and too little analysis leads to a boring read. Paid too much for an outdated book. Lesson learned."
4,Kind of neat...,"Very, very interesting. I found this book by way of another pet communicator who, after doing a reading on my pets, recommended this book. I can't say I learned how to communicate telepathically with my pets, but... hmmm... What Penelope Smith says makes sense: quiet mind is the first step for so many other things, from good health to artistic creation to, yes, it certainly seems possible, telepathically communicating with animals. The trouble is, sorting out the junk from genuine communication. So, in all, so far, I haven't gotten all that much from this book. But I'm very glad Penelope Smith wrote it. I know I will come back and re-read it."
3,"A little looney, I'd say...","Call me a skeptic, but a lot of the notions of telepathic communication with your pets in this book struck me as a little ""out there."" But I wouldn't disregard this book completely even if you don't believe in telepathy. The core of this book, in my interpretation, is to learn how to empathize with your pets and to place them as equals to you in order to gain a deeper emotional connection. I've done the techniques, and it seems like there is a stronger bond between me and my cats. But I don't think I can communicate with them. Some of the conversations that Ms. Smith has seem a little ludicrous, and I'd even venture to guess that she hears those voices, but they don't come from the animals... kinda like how Anthony Perkins heard his mom's voice in ""Psycho."""
1,I pass on this book,"I'm an animal lover, have several hundred books and more than 100 documentary films about animals. I'm always looking for another publication to add to my knowledge and be uplifted or amazed by our animal friends.However, after reading Amazon customers' comments on Smith's book, there were enough negative critiques to steer me away from it.For those who share my decision, and also, perhaps, those who don't, you might be interested in another book of the same title -- ""Animal Talk: Breaking the Code of Animal Language,"" by Tim Friend, pub. 2004. He's an excellent writer, and for this reader, at least, there isn't a dull page anywhere, his sense of humor (carefully applied, never overdone) adds a pleasant sparkle to the intriguing narrative, and there's not a single ""over-the-top"" statement that would stretch anyone's credulity. I highly recommend it.-- Richard"
3,Depends on the Reader,"After reading a good deal of the book (I haven't finished it) and also going over others' reviews, it seems like the enjoyment of the book is greatly limited by the skeptism of the reader. If you're approaching it to tear it apart, it's simple enough to do so. There are some places in the book (such as where she says she's telling stories that give examples of love but don't even mention the word love or anything related to love within either story) that are easy to look at and go, ""Did she even know what she was talking about?"" While there are others that made me go, ""Huh. I never thought of it in that light!"" Ultimately, I think anyone can get something out of the book if they are open enough to do so, but the book also has the limitations that any book that requires faith does: Faith and Proof are not included, so don't expect it to be."
4,Easy and uncomplicated,"I love the author's simplicity. If you are not sure about this ""telepathy thing"", you will, as an animal lover, definitely connect to the author's stories. I think this book is a wonderful and easy ""jumping off"" place to start. You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain."
1,No Actor,"This is another throwaway with Casper Van Dien that proves once again how unbelievable an actor he is. The film with another actor playing opposite the incredible Margaux Hemingway would have been satisfactory, but once again someone in hollywood sticks poor Casper Van Dien, that causes every picture he's in to flop, into this movie."
3,Beads break,"I bought this rope for my 7-year-old son who has taken a recent interest in jump roping. The rope is adjustable, although there are no instructions for how to adjust it - I had to figure it out for myself. He has been using it frequently for a week or two, and the beads are constantly breaking off. The red ones went first, but now the black ones are starting to break. It's a nice rope with good handles, but the beads need to be made from a more durable plastic."
1,poor quality jump rope,Valeo Beaded Jump RopeThis is a poor quality jump rope. The beads started breaking after just one use. My other jump rope is over 20yrs old and the beads have yet to break. The beads are also too light so the jump rope does not swing properly. I would not recommend this jump rope.
4,GOOD STARTER ROPE,"This is Just what I expected for the price. It is easy enough to use for quick workouts, warm-ups and training exercises."
1,Disappointing,"I found this book less than impressive and what bothers me the most is the price. I bought it new, paid over $50.00 for it and frankly I thought I would be getting a lot more. A lot more information, a lot more detail, a lot more of basically everything. (Even the binding on this book is disappointing!) It might work well for a junior high school report but that is because it is rather like a junior high school report. The author paints his picture of the time in VERY broad strokes and really doesn't bother with details. It might be fine as your first reference book on the Elizabethans, but it won't due if you have more than a passing knowledge going in. At $12.95 this book would have been okay. The high price, however, raises expectations and leaves one with the impression that it is going to be a far more informative book. There are better books out there on this topic and they cost far less. Don't buy it at the full price. Don't but it if you are looking for real scholarship."
2,I hope it gets better...,"Like another reviewer, I too am in the SCA. Unlike that reviewer, I found this book wanting based on the first three pages alone! The author makes multiple factual errors, e.g. describing the period from the beginning of Henry VIII's reign to the English Civil War as ""peaceful."" My guess is that Henry VIII's war with France, Elizabeth's persistent problems on the Scots border, and the Armada were deemed insignificant. He describes Mary Tudor's reign as undistinguished and refers to her restorattion of the Catholic church and persecution of Protestants as something of an afterthought. This demonstrates at a minimum that the author has seriously neglected an understanding of the historical reality of the period. This calls into questions anything else that may be brought forward regarding ""Daily Life."" I am reluctant to ""review"" a book I have not read, but given the preview on Amazon, I was deeply troubled!"
3,Erase Markers are just that,They work okay and so far they haven't run dry. The spray cleans the surface okay also. Hopefully we'll get lots of use out of this product.
5,Works fine,Its markers and an eraser. Works just fine. The markers wipe off fine whether the writing is 1 week old or 1 month. Haven't even needed the spray bottle yet.
2,Walmart is cheaper!,"The product is good and working well. However, Walmart has exactly the same product and it is cheaper! make sure compare the price when u buy it."
2,Most of the markers work,"Most of the markers work, but the black one was missing the writing tip so it was useless. I guess I only really need 3 markers, and it's not really worth the effort to return it."
1,Try The Low Odor Version First !!,"Simple product, right? I assumed a dry-erase marker would be judged by two criteria: does it write well on my dry-erase board and is it easily erased? Not so fast my friend (er, . . . myself). While these markers meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of odor they produce is totally disqualifying.I have a 3M 24""x36"" dry erase board in my office on which I write simple reminders about what I want to do each week and each day. With these markers, I can write about 15 words before the volume of the smell permeates my office and the hall outside.Fortunately, Expo's ""Low Odor"" markers seem to work just as well as the regular version. Do yourself a favor and start with those."
3,Decent Starter Kit,"I bought this to accompany a portable white board I had purchased.The markers all work well as expected, and the spray is nice when the board is extra dirty.The eraser works alright, but it can get pretty beat up after a bit of use.I would suggest getting another eraser because the one that comes in this kit is pretty basic, it's made out of styrofoam like material and feels a bit flimsy."
5,Works as expected,Everything works fine and I would recommend this to anyone as a starter kit. The only that bothers me is the eraser. It functions but it just feels a little cheap.
2,Not satisfied,"The pen point shape is ridiculous, I have to carefully tilt the pen when writing. The lid is tight, in an uncomfortable way"
2,Rip off,I expected to get brand new markers in unused condition but what I received were markers that *looked* new.I used them once and capped them... I came back to use them the next day (the red and black markers) and the ink looked more like grey and light red... I wanted high quality markers which is why I came to the original brand... Disappointment.
3,Editing was very lax if not lacking completely,"The stories were very vivid and put you in the situations. However,there was alot of repetition that this type of writting (individial stories) is prone to. Editing could have prevented those. Also there many mistakes, misspelled words and typos. This all took away from the validity of the stories.USAF Pilot, RVN 1966-67"
5,I Have to Raise the Rating!!!,"I stumbled across the three-star average for this and was appalled. Of course, it is based on one person giving a poor toss-off review and another person giving a positive review, still a toss-off. I identify with what the latter reviewer is doing here. Amazon reviews cannot do this work justice. You have to go soak this in for yourself. All I can say is that it is as life-changing as theory gets. All the rest of us can dream of being so revolutionary and lucid as Kristeva here. That is the use of this book in this era. An important use at that."
1,Empty waffle,"This book is an exmaple of the ""new emperor clothes"" effect. Only the 'clever' people can 'understand' it, and other people are afraid to say that don't undertsand, because then they will not be regarded clever."
2,"Scary start, but needs rewriting.","I had high hopes for this novel. It started off ok, but descended into nonsense.It was written in 1999 and never published. After 9/11 the publishers pulled it out of the discard heap and, in 2004 (undoubtedly in response to demand for terrorist novels), it was published as a paperback with little or no rewriting.The book paints a scary scenario, but then becomes chaotic and hard to follow. Many thriller novels require suspension of logic, but this book brings that to a new level.Read the first half and stop."
2,"Good Photos, but Insufferably Inadequate Travel Guide","Although the photographs are brilliant, and the descriptions of Taiwan's more famous sights are interesting; the practical travel necessities are sorely lacking.There is hardly any mention of the means to arrive at the locations illustrated in the book, and relevant information regarding cities or transportation is nonexistent.If one is looking for a book simply to admire Taiwan through photos and occassionally insightful prose, Insight Guide Taiwan is an adequate choice. However, speaking from experience, for helpful travel information, stick with Lonely Planet."
3,Last on Earth,I liked this book. It was interesting at some parts like when they went to the hair salon and they were going to do Tiffany's hair but they left it in too long and all of her hair fell out! There were also other parts that were not so good like when they locked Cam in his room and they took 5 pages to get him out. That part was boring. I would suggest this book to a older person becouse I had trouble understanding it in some parts.
3,Get Quicken 2007 before it's too late,"After struggling with Microsoft Money for years, and having to completley start over a couple of times because Microsoft Money failed to download any more data, I've officially switched. I was hesitent after reading the reviews from both programs, but I took a gamble and won. I don't know how Quicken was before their 2007 version, but I tried the free trial of Microsoft Money 2007 before trying Quicken and I encountered many of the usual problems..Since using Quicken, everything has been VERY simple and easy to use...Goodbye Microsoft, you will not be missed."
4,How Did I Ever Get Along Without This Product,Great product inside and out. It's great being able to see how much money I truly do not have at a simple glance...yummy.
1,POC,"I bought this software program together with TaxCut a few months ago, and it is a great disappointment. Unfortunately, I was too busy to give it a try earlier, so now I can't get all my money back from Amazon. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
3,Typical Microsoft Mediocrity,"I have used four previous versions of MSM, with the first two being the best. Later editions are more complicated ( they say feature filled ) and more buggy. Primarily, I use this product to keep track of my stock portfolio. The last edition that I had, MSM 2005 Premium would not record a stock spin-off, even though it had a command for doing so. MS said that they new of the problem and did not plan to fix it. I had to upgrade to MSM 2006 which fixed that problem. Now I discover that the program will not update prices on such well known companies as Johnson & Johnson. This also, a problem that MS knows of, but they will not predict a solution timeline. I wish I had a better program to go to, but I have more that six years of investment history in this program which does not easily port over to say, Quicken. Bottom line, it works -- sort of-- sort of the way Windows does."
1,"Unstable, no significant new features","This version is aweful! I've been using it for 4 months now and it constantly crashes. It seems that it always happens when I try to match a downloaded transaction with a scheduled bill. No update/fix available so far. What's worse is that this version has no significant new features than my previous version (2005). I mean, I bought it with the thought that there will be new cool stuffs, but all the features that I regularly use have no improvements. The new features are either not necessary (spending tracker - you can use the old budget sheet) or too confusing to use."
1,Awful experience,"I worked with the customer service reps at Microsoft for days (phone calls lasting hours) to finally reach the conclusion that there were too many bugs in this software to allow it to function properly. I ended up returning it, very dissatisfied. My advice - do not buy this product! It wasted so much of my time."
3,Doesn't have Windows Mobile support,"Don't get me wrong. Money is a great product on the PC, but when Microsoft, in its infinite wisdom, migrated Pocket PC to Windows Mobile, they stopped making a MS/Money module for it. One of the great features of Money was being able to keep track of expenses when you're away from the home or office. Sure, you can carry your laptop with you, but that's not very convenient. I wish they would at least explain whey they did this."
1,Doesn't work any more,This software is dead and no longer supported by Microsoft. Don't waste time buying it. Go with Quicken brand software instead!!!
1,My last MS Money purchase,"I'm currently on my third copy of MS Money, previously used 2004. I think 2004 may have been the last decent version. 2007 (With SP1) seems pretty buggy in the portfolio interface, very slow compared to older versions, and their free ""premium"" services sucks. The MyPublicInfo offer is only good if you BUY a copy of the MyPublicInfo report (You get a second free.) Carbonite, which I have a demo right now, works great - unfort., it ONLY backs up your Money files in the premium package.This is definitely my last copy of MS Money. I'll be switching to SOMETHING else, probably Quicken, though I don't hear the best things about it either."
4,Money 2007 Premium,"Money is a quite competent finance program. However, it is becoming too bloated with bells and whistles that appeal to the ""do every thing in one package"" consumer. As a consequence, the controls on what it does are limited because it tries to do so much. It would benefit from more and better charting, graphing, and forcasting if some lesser used features were dropped."
3,Beware of Quicken Conversion,"Conversion of your data from Quicken is not a given. I was unable to make it work and, after some research, have come to the conclusion that it is generally not possible. You will be able to import and it will look impressive, but when you start digging into the data it will be incompete.I did not try to use Money and it may be a great program, but the import does not work from Quicken."
3,Beware of using the Downloaded version!,"I'm not sure how the cd works, but I installed the downloaded version of Money 2007 Deluxe on a dual-boot machine. I have been using Vista along with my beloved XP Pro because there are no drivers available for my pro-sumer audio card. So I switch back and forth. Money installed fine on one OS, but when I went to install on the other...no dice. It says it has been installed on the maximum number of computers and won't allow another install. I build and change systems as often as changing my Fruit of The Looms (and that's pretty often). Does the cd-rom version do this too? Someone please e-mail me and let me know. It's funny...Vista will let you run it's OS for a whole 30 days without a serial number (read: frequent partition formats!) but I can't run Money on more than one machine. Go Microsoft! - idiots."
2,Online Features Don't Work With IE 7 Content Advisor Turned On.,Online Features Don't Work With IE 7 Content Advisor Turned On on my Windows XP Pro SP2 PC.This product has been confirmed my Microsoft Tech Support not to work with MS Internet Explorer 7 Content Advisor (IE Parental Control Feature to protect kids on the Internet) turned on at this time. They couldn't give me a time extimate for an update that would fix the problem.Jim.
1,Former loyal customer says this is KRAP!,"I've been using PC-based accounting for my home since the first version of Quicken came out a billion years ago. I've been using Microsoft Money since 1999. I'm a happy, easy customer! I'm faithful to pay the price every couple of years to upgrade to the latest version. NO MORE! All of a sudden, and it must be tied to the new 2008 calendar year, MS Money can't open my regular file or any of my backups! I backup regularly. It isn't a file problem. My Vista PC has worked great for 9 months. This has something to do with some new automatic update that screwed everything up. I'll probably switch to Quicken soon. This is the time of year when I do my taxes, so it is the most important time for MS Money to work. It has failed me. An internet search says this is a common and recent problem with MS Money. KRAP. Bill Gates & Company have designed an overly complex operating system that sometimes fails the most basic tasks."
1,Not compatible with the trial version,I was using the trial version of Microsoft money. When I installed the actual version bought from Amazon it could not read my existing data. I called Microsoft and they told me that even though the products were the same the trial version was a newer version and not compatible. I had to return this to amazon. Amazon gave me my money back.
2,Not so much.,"I got this for my husband so he could wear normal clothes for a change and not have to try and hide his side arm all the time. It didn't really work for his .40 for several reasons. He didn't feel like it was very secure, or comfortable and the gun made a noticeable bulge beneath his 501 type pant ankles. Maybe if he was a bigger person who wore baggier clothes it would have been okay. He has a tall, athletic build."
4,Super Reader,"This is another Elric book that was published around 1990, quite a time after the the others, and after The Fortress of the Pearl.Elri must locate the soul of his father, to enable him to stop his doomed wandering. At least, according to a dragon, anyway. With him will be the female warrior Rose. As is often the case, agents of Chaos, and the Duke Arioch will stand in their way.The true motivations of the Rose will decide Elric's actions."
2,Dragged on,"I have read all the Elric books in the original series and enjoyed them all, especially the first, Elric of Melnibone. I also read the full Corum series and enjoyed it. This book, however, I found painful to get through and almost just gave up. There is very little ""action"" in the form of fighting or even clear strategizing on the part of the characters. There was a lot of talking and the plot was hard to follow with all the ""multiverse"" planes and spheres stuff, traveling through time, etc etc. I never really enjoyed that aspect of Moorcock's books. Some of the wording I found strange, such as the seemingly random way characters either ""said"" something (past tense) or ""says"" something (e.g. ""let's go,"" says Elric). A few sections seemed to be criticizing capitalism in the context of present day politics, which I found off-putting. Only recommended for Elric hard cores, which maybe I thought I was but must not be."
3,It just didn't seem the same,"Elric has always been my favorite of the Champions. This book just didn't seem the same as the earlier ones, though. Of course, I've changed a lot since then, too. This one seemed overly contemplative, and Elric was too conveniently whisked through the multiverse to keep the plot together. Also lacking in action, and the final battle seemed a formality."
2,Good but not great,"The Fugitive was a good television show but it was not a great one. Unfortunately, it is priced as if it was one of the best shows ever produced. When the price for every season falls to $14.99 I'll purchase them. Until then - forget it!"
5,"""The law says he's guilty. I enforce the law.""","Finally, the greatest TV series of all time makes it on to DVD! What took so long? Easily the best series of all-time (IMHO) because David Janssen was born to play this role. Also, Richard Kimble is the only kind and compassionate television character ever, which makes this standout from anything else you've ever seen. Can hardly wait until August 14th!"
3,missing!,"With all the reviews I have read about this show I have yet to see any comment stating that the 'real ' pilot show is missing! Not even from people who saw the original series! This showed the arguement, the murdered wife, and the killer leaving the scene. Some of these scenes are shown in 'THE GIRL FROM LITTLE EGYPT'and I think CBS Paramount should make an effort to find this missing pilot episode!"
5,AT LAST,"Tony Curtis once said that he imagined himself as Cary Grant whenver he'd leave a Cinema after watching one of the star's films. For me it was Sean Connery and Dr. Richard Kimble, the latter especially when I found myself having to hitchhike in Ireland in the '60s. Like the reviewer who's anxious about the release of the rest of the series, I beg CBS/Paramount to put us out of our misery and get them out ASAP. However, I'm content to wait if any delay is contingent on producing the same jaw-dropping quality of the first volume. Unbelievable."
5,...the day the waiting stopped!!,...finally I have the new DVD in my hands and am throughly impressed. The picture quality is superb and the sound is fantastic! I highly recommend this dvd set to anyone who loved this show. You cannot go wrong...hurry up and release the rest so we can enjoy them all like this! Amazing!
1,Damaged discs,"Great show and worth the money, but majority of the DVDs arrived with smudges on them. Several episodes on the DVDs can not be accessed or played due to that damage. Obviously the DVDs had been previously used and returned. I bought from Amazon, not a subsidiary. Suprised that the DVDs were sold in this condition. Poor inspection by Amazon before selling."
4,Finally on DVD - but minus one star for greed,"I've been waiting years for The Fugitive to arrive on DVD. I resent, though, the method of packaging this series. I rushed ahead with my order, not realizing this was only 1/2 of the first season, and Amazon took no pains to point this out. While I am grateful to finally see the show again, it will, at this rate, take years to release the entire four-season series. This means big bucks for CBS, Paramount and Amazon, of course. I will enjoy this first volume, but now I'll wait for the one big box set of the whole show. Maybe in 2012?It's great to see David Janssen again - a real adult, not a boy-with-attitude like so many of our leading men today. And he was only in his early thirties when the series began. Real, grown-up men like Janssen, Richard Boone, Henry Fonda and the others just aren't around anymore. I miss guys like that in our culture.Maybe I will buy volume 2 after all!"
5,POSSIBLY THE BEST TELEVISION SHOW EVER!!!,"It's too bad that we have to wait almost the entire summer for THE FUGITIVE, to come out on DVD, but anyone who have ever seen this classic show, knows that it is worth the wait. Anyone who has never seen THE FUGITIVE...You're in for a treat! This is what good television drama is all about! They don't make television shows like this anymore. There are few television shows that should be on the top of the mountain, of high quality television. THE FUGITIVE, without a doubt...beyond the shadow of a doubt...beyond all doubt is on that mountain top."
5,"If You Like ""The Fugitive"" You will also Like ""Route 66"" which is released on October 23, 2007","Route 66 - Season 1, Vol. 1is finally being released on DVD on 10//23/07! The Fugitive and Route 66 are my all time favorite television dramas! Parmamount/CBS DVD did an excellent job with the transfer of the Fugitive. I taped this show when it was A&E; and just threw my VHS tapes in the trash. I HATE!!!! that they split the seasons up to make money. I'd rather pay the extra $$$ to keep the season whole. They did the same to the Streets of San Francisco too, I wish they would stop it! In any event this DVD is well worth the money it looks great, sounds great and is better than anything on TV today... Please release the next part NOW!!! You know I will I buy it despite my objections!"
4,Jupiter Rising - instant addiction!,"I heard Dan May while walking past a free concert. I didn't have time to stop for long, but I what I heard intrigued me enough to go buy an album. I haven't fallen in love with the whole thing yet - though it does make for nice driving/reading/working music. One track, however, gets put on repeat almost every time I listen - Jupiter Rising, which is just so catchy and fun and lyrically clever: ""I'd give you the moon, but that too revolves around you."""
3,well worth a look,"Yes,this film has it's limitations but it also has its strengths - considering that 99.9% of direct-to-video ""movies"" are total dreck,this stands as an interesting and fairly entertaining genre film (the fact it was shot on film counts for something!)The pacing is a little slow,and yes it can be a bit confusing,but I feel that it was at least partially deliberate and not due to incompetence!As it stands,I wouldn't suggest rushing out and aquiring at all costs,but it does remain an entertaining example of mid-to-late 80's direct to video film making that leaves me feeling (somewhat) nostalgic for pre-CGI cheap-o horror movies"
4,To Dreamers Dead And Dying...,"Made in Ohio for very little money, BEYOND DREAM'S DOOR is a sometimes goofy, somewhat shabby, eerily entertaining low budget film from the 80s. Logic is tossed out in favor of nightmarish imagery and apocalyptic atmosphere. Don't expect multi-million dollar fx or high-calibre acting. This is a small project w/ a big, dark heart! There are just as many brilliant moments as there are cheeezy ones, making for a semi-haunting experience. If you enjoy demons, ghouls, and / or the supernatural, then BDD is worth your time..."
3,taking the student film standpoint,"yes, this movie is rather poor in editing and other aspects (acting especially). There are some interesting psychological aspects though, that I did find to be fascinating. Considering a lot of the low budget horror that is being released today, this movie at least has some depth and originality. I rated it off the lack of experience but good ideas angle for the students who did this project."
1,Eric Idle is a money-grubbing wh*re!,"I love the Rutles (everything Rutles up until this).I questioned Neil Innes about this 2nd Rutles movie at Beatlefest 2008 in Chicago in August. He said that him and Idle ate lunch together one day at which time Eric asked him what he thought of a second Rutles movie. Neil said he supported the concept. The snobbish (my words, not Neil's) Idle then went ahead with the 2nd movie without any input whatsoever from Neil or the other 2 Rutles. What a moron!My 6-yr old and 3-yr old love watching the 1st Rutles movie with me, as well as enjoying both Rutles albums. This 2nd movie however is not family friendly and is currently over their heads with all of the filthy sexual references that Idle saw fit to include.Eric Idle is a has been. This will be the last time this consumer puts any money in Idle's pockets. Take my advice, please.....and don't waste your time or money on this stinker of a mockumentary."
3,Good continuing saga...but not as good as the first.,"This is a good DVD full of great humor and music, but pales in comperison to the first Eric Idle production. This DVD takes you 20 yaers later, and there is'nt much tho show. All of us have gotten older and greyer and this DVD shows it. It's basicaly a revamp of the first DVD. it borrows most of it's footage from the first, with Eric yapping on continously through-out it to make up the extra minutes. not worth it unless you are a true fan (Like myself)"
2,btlfan,"I enjoyed the first Ruttle DVD so much that I preordered Ruttles 2 and had it delivered on March 1st. I must confess that I was very happy with the outcome. Eric was trying to be too funny and overdoing soooooo many Python like things that just were not happening, at least for me. It was just like the first with a bunch of cameos that were OK. Even Robin Williams was flat.Sorry, thats what I think."
1,A big disappointment.,"I was a huge Rutles fan, and was greatly anticipating this release. Unfortunately, it consists mostly of clips of the Rutles from the first special (although there are occasional flashes of footage apparently unused from the first special) interspersed with new interviews (Steve Martin, James Taylor, Conan O'Brien, Carrie Fisher, and others). Eric Idle even rips himself off; the show opens with a sight gag -- Idle trying to keep up with an accelerating camera as he narrates -- taken directly from the original program. It all has a cobbled-together feel and offers nothing of substance new for Rutles fans."
1,Stop Eric Idle Before he Kills Again!,"This is an uninspired, strained, and literal rehash of the original RUTLES film, devoid of any of the original's wit. While Neil Innes actually improved on the soundtrack to the original with the ""Anthology"" take-off ""Archeology,"" Eric Idle seems (un)comfortable ripping himself off in the most hackneyed and superficial way. Overall, the normally clever Idle has greatly tarnished the simple charm of one of his finest achievements. It's obvious why Warner Bros. didn't know what to do with it, and as for the celebrity interviews, most are poorly improvised, woefully unfunny and drag on way too long."
1,"Eric, it could have been sooo much better.","I agree with virtually all of the other reviews posted: ""Can't Buy Me Lunch"" is totally uninspired. The music is great and I'd reccommend any Rutles fan to buy the ""Archeology"" CD right now - Use the money you were going to waste on ""Can't Buy Me Lunch.""Eric, I'm addressing you personally: By now, you've read the other reviews and I'm sure you would like to make amends somehow. So, how about showing us how the Rutles are doing today? You know, an aging rock band - and nobody was shot and nobody died of cancer. They broke apart and had their solo careers and everybody wanted them to get back together again... you know the story. Just start where you left off with ""All You Need is Cash."" We all realize that you are all older now, but so are the Rutles. Use the original guys. Give us what we all wanted and never got - the reunion.You are welcome to use my idea free of charge.Your pal, Mike Kirchubel"
1,Dreck! Dreck! Dreck! Dreck! Dreck!,"Eric Idle takes the now-far-larger budget from Lorne Michaels and spends it all on travel, looking for ways to milk recycled shtick.Absolutely no idea here is original; the interview bits are snoozers except for a precious few seconds each from Robin Williams and Catherine O'Hara putting on mock German accents. The sole mercy is that, except for clips from the first show, none of the original Pre-Fab Four are anywhere to be seen - interestingly enough, Idle himself doesn't appear on ""The Rutles Archaeology"" cd (coincidence? You tell me.)That's $21.99 + tax I'll never see again (I didn't buy it at Amazon - serves me right.) I just hope the tax will be well spent."
1,"How about a refund, Mr. Idle?","This is just a rehash of the first Rutles DVD, with MAYBE 1 or 2 minutes of new footage. Particularly reprehensible is changing the speed of performances to fit newer recordings to try and trick viewers into thinking they are seeing something new. (The song ""Easy Listening"" is the one they use.) It's clear that Idle is completely out of ideas, as he relentlessly and desperately beats old jokes into the ground. The addition of the mysteriously-employed-in-showbiz Jimmy Fallon also should be a warning to everyone.Why Idle felt the need to tell the Rutles story in basically the same way, with basically the same footage, and yet package it as something new is beyond me. Surely he doesn't need grocery money.This is a beyond cynical cash-in attempt by a guy whose glory days are clearly well behind him. This disc is being sold in a very misleading way. Mr. Idle should cough up refunds.Too bad there is not an option for 0 Stars."
3,The Rutles 2 dvd - Can't Buy Me Lunch,"Not so goodThe extras are a little interesting (Tom Hanks, Bowie interviews) but I can't imagine this being cherished as the originalWhen you think of the original film, you think of classic bits: Bill Murray the K, Jim Belushi as the Klein character, Leggy getting around (and tragically accepting a teaching post abroad - but the other Rutles COULD call!)Here theres nothing really new. Its kind of bland. Its fun to see Jennifer Lopez interviewed on the Rutles, but, really, the only thing I really remember about this film is the music (Archaeology!)Again, don't buy, cos its really not that good. Its not terrible or anything, but you get the sense its just a rehash of the original. And I would swear theres some footage repeated from the original!Watch the original Rutles film though! its a really hoot, with a lot of SNL folk (Belushi, Murray, Radner, Davis)"
3,Love The Rutles,"A recap of the brilliant Beatles bio satire. Not much new here, it's for collectors only. For the uninitiated, get ""The Rutles"". The jokes are recalls & the whole thing is just a reminder that the first one is there.I liked it, but it's a library item & I'd rather watch the original if the subject of ""The Rutles"" comes up. Like all satire, if you've not seen the first one, it won't make much sense. In that, if you're not well educated in Beatles bio, you'll miss the subtle humor. It's kind of a British ""Spinal Tap"" and came several years years before ""Tap"" did.Musicians & Beatle-O-Files should see ""The Rutles"" (the first one), it's very funny & has ""Cool-Cool-Daddy-O"" cameos including Beatle George who helped finance the Monty Python guys.I also recommend ""The Concert For George"" on DVD."
4,all you need is mousse.,"okay, granted. ""cash"" was much better. but bowie's hair was stunning. you at least have to admit that."
1,nice packaging..shame about the content!,"as a huge beatles ,monty python,bonzo dog band fan,i was hugely dissapointed with the rutles sequel.i have the archaeology c.d and it would have been nice to see neil innes and the other guys on the dvd as they got together for the reunion.i know there is a video for ""shangri-la"" which should have been included.eric...shame on you!!!....everyone save your money and put it towards tickets for eric's spamalot on broadway ..i hear its wonderful!"
1,An exhumed & desecrated corpse,"Perhaps if you are 80 years old, eating jello in a home somewhere, sitting in a soiled diaper, and the attendant wheels you in front of a TV and turns on this DVD, you'll enjoy it. For the rest of us, who remember the genius of the original, this rehash was painful rip on the soul, a reminder that all our heroes fade, the things we fondly recall from childhood are now rotten, and mediocrity is what awaits us all.The only excuse Eric Idle has for making this would be a severe drug problem, like the kind where you do Robert Downey Jr/Less Than Zero jobs for James Spader to support your habit. If he doesn't have a problem like this, then someone should put Idle's head into an oil fryer at McDonald's and hold it under until he begs for forgiveness for foisting this excrement upon the world.Awful garbage, a disgrace."
2,Can't stomach it!!!!,"Not as good as the original "" ... Cash! ""A summary / rehash of 'stuff' from the first offering.I shouldn't have purchased it!!I saw the 1st. one when it originally aired;loved it and therefore swallowed the hype. I hoped for more from the sequel!!!"
1,useless,There is no reason for this to be made. It gave the chance for current stars to try and capture something that has long since passed. It is awful and boring.Nothing new here. I wish i would have been able to rent before i bought
1,Ouch!,"I am a huge fan of the original Rutles (1978) so maybe I was expecting too much but it simply isn't funny. Unlike Spinal Tap where the documentary spends a lot of time in the present, the original Rutles takes place years after the band broke up. There's no more story to tell; there's no reason for a sequel - especially since most clips were already shown in the original.The interviews are miserably bad. Who knew you could have Robin Williams, Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, and Eric Idle and still not deliver a laugh?The more you know about the Beatles, the funnier the original Rutles is. The more you appreciate the original Rutles, the more you should avoid the sequel. This never should have been made."
1,Rutles - Stick with the Original!,"It's hard to imagine why this video was even made. It has none of the inspired genius of the original. The only plus is a little new music from Anthology, but all the Rutles footage is old and was on the first one! The only interesting bit was Ron Nasty on Saturday Night Live, and they covered it over with - you guessed it - footage from the original video! The new celebrity interviews were horrible too, and had none of the fun of the interviews in the original. There are no new interviews of the band, no information about what they're doing, either fictional or real, and only a tiny bit of unused material from the original. A great opportunity has been missed, and sorely missed at that! David Raymer."
1,Nothing New Here,"Essentially a rehash of the original ""All You Need is Cash"" with recycled footage and bits. Stick with the original and let this one pass. It would appear from the lack of effort, that this one really ought to have been titled ""All You Need is Cash"" because apparently someone needs money: don't contribute yours."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"The original ""All You Need is Cash"" was such a landmark that I couldn't believe all the negative reactions this DVD got. Eric Idle's writing and Neil Innes' music in the original were both masterworks. However, this program has all the hallmarks of a ""let's gather up all the unused footage and see what we can do with it"" feel. There is some interesting and amusing ""new"" (ie, old) footage in this, but that's about all I can say for it. All the good stuff was shot 30 years ago. Spend your Rutles money on Innes' ""Rutles Archaeology"" CD. That maintains the quality of the original work. Maybe Eric Idle needed a paycheck and got desperate - I don't know; but this just isn't anywhere near the brilliance of the original. Still, I have every other Rutles CD, album, 45, bootleg, etc., so I had to add this to the collection. Maybe someday I'll get around to watching the second half."
4,Used Huckelberry Finn,"The authoritative Text and criticism of HUCKLEBERRY FINN is definitely a scholarly edition of this wonderful story. It arrived by the Amazon shipping deadline, there were quite a few underlinings and comments by the previous owner, and of course, it's Mark Twain at his best."
5,awesome,"exactly what I expected, the description matched the product perfectly, the book was in mint condition."
1,Andre the Giant Larger than life,"Andre the Giant Larger than Life isn't a wrestling tape, it's a documentary that was that originally shown on A&E. So if you are looking for a wrestling tape this one isn't for you as there are no matches or even reasonably long clips of matches on this tape. It is also only 45 minutes long. The tape is mainly interviews from Andre's friends such as Tim White (wwf ref) and Andre's brother. The narrator was a poor selection (obviously not a wrestling fan)for he had a slightly condescending and patronizing tone that I'm sure most of you are as sick of as I am from non-wrestling fans when they discuss sports-entertainment."
3,A good introduction for the layperson,"Certainly, this book is not for the professional entomologist, but I am not an entomologist and found the book to be a relatively effective history of the mosquito, malaria and other diseases, and human understanding of this insect. Like other reviewers, I did think there was a bit much repetition, but the reading is easy, and it's certainly possible to skip over a paragraph here or there until new territory is reached.There is brief treatment of the life cycle of the mosquito before the book settles into its primary topic, disease and its transmission. Discussions of DDT, West Nile virus, and methods of (attempted) mosquito eradication were, to me, informative, and I do believe I know significantly more now than I did before reading this book."
3,Interesting though not always fun,"This book was written by a scientist and a journalist yet it was never clear to me what the contribution of the journalist was. The book writing showed knowledge, but not skills. The few attempts to make the reading captivating felt forced.The content was great however and it was never tedious. It is just that some books really get you captivated regardless of the topic and this is not one of those books.I wish it had covered a bit more about the different types of mosquitoes, and a bit more about their lives (only first 2 or 3 chapters do so). But it is still a worthwhile read. It talks a lot about the deadly diseases that are spread by mosquitoes and humans' long lasting battle against them."
2,"Okay, but there are better books on microbial disease","Perhaps I was merely spoiled by the book I read right before reading this one (Microbe Hunters by Paul de Kruif), but I found this book thoroughly mediocre both in content and style. The author constantly shifts between 3rd person narrator/teacher, man-on-the-scene, and editorializer, without spending sufficient time as any one of them. In fact, I was often disappointed by the brevity with which each of the book's subtopics was explored. It weighs in at a sparse ~225 pages, large print.Unless you have a particular interest in mosquitoes, I instead recommend Microbe Hunters, a classic (1926?) book on some of the important scientists and discoveries in the early history of microbiology."
2,Didn't answer my question,I had only one question I wanted answered by this book -- why do mosquitos bite some people (such as me!) and not others. It was never addressed.
4,Calling All Romantics!,"Lortzing's operas are mystifyingly difficult to find these days, and even when available they seem to be haphazardly constructed. This edition features the libretto only in German (particularly annoying considering the number of comic moments), although notes and synopsis are in English.I'm not going to quibble over the individual performances, although it sounded solid enough to me. For the most part, I'm just pleased to have an opera that shares so much with the work of Weber and Marschner. As much as I love Der Freischutz, which is of course widely available, and Der Vampyr & Hans Heiling (also somewhat tricky to find these days), it's good to see that an entirely worthwhile opera by a composer of a similar creative vision is finally appearing on CD in America. If you like the German Romantic composers, this is a splendid example of the genre, in spite of the shortcomings in presentation."
4,Helpful insights,The author suffers from bi-polar disorder and writes from a personal as well as a clinical perspective that is helpful. I have one family member who has been diagnosed as bi-polar and another who thinks she is probably hypo-manic. This book helps me understand both better. A better understanding lowers my frustration with things I have always found very difficult. The book also offers some hope by discussing treatments that do work.
1,What an awful book for such an important topic!,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about seven years ago. That said, I've tried to read everything I can get my hands on regarding the topic. The Jane Mountain book was just awful. It was written on a fifth-grade level, way too simplified and quite pedestrian. I was surprised since Mountain is a doctor as well as a sufferer. Kay Redfield Jamison, a doctor as well, did a much better job of lending insights into the disorder with ""An Unquiet Mind"", a seminal work in the field. I would highly recommend her book as well as the Mondimore book. His was clinical, detailed and insightful. The Mountain book was almost demeaning, it was really dumbed-down. I can't believe the high ranking it got, which is why I bought it in the first place. What a waste of time (even though the volume is so short and only took a few hours to read!)"
3,Trooper belt buckle,"The trooper belt buckle is a nice item. Although the face of eddie does not do justice at all. The face is wierd. The mouth sticks out and makes eddie look funky, besides that I recomend getting it. I liked the buckle because there are not to many iron maiden belt buckles out there, but there are some really cool ones. Just don't rush into anything without looking around first."
2,boring and pointless,"I'm a big fan of Vince Vaughn, but he could not rescue this movie. He has some good dialogue, but that does not make a movie. Jennifer Aniston once again played herself-can she even act? At least it didn't have the typical sappy Hollywood ending. HD DVD picture quality was OK at best. Not even worth renting."
1,not funny,why did this movie get billed as a comedy? This was an awful film. Talk about petty & mean spirited.My husband walked out on it & left me to finish it on my own.I have to say the only redeemable part of this film was after all was said & done Vince Vaughns & Jennifer Anistons character's were civil to one another.I watched it once & then took it to my local book/video trader & got rid of it!Don't waste your money on this one.
3,Just like home,"This moivie really hits home.. This sounds like any marriage at times. All couples do go through this same thing whether they break up of not. Did not think it was very funny. Jennifer Anniston is very good in the movie, but she is good in movie that she stars in."
2,poor Jennifer Aniston,It's too bad Jennifer Aniston can't find a decent movie or role. This film is just not good. Vince Vaughn's character is so unlikable and Jen's character is quite lovely so this couple never comes off being remotely realistic. It's also very silly that she keeps trying and he keeps being a jerk.
5,LOL! / Pulls at the Heart,"You know its great when you laugh at all the funnies, ache at the rough (dramatic) spots, and feel unbelievably nonplussed at the ending! Three, er, Two thumbs up!"
3,Paint by numbers,"Aniston's artiste boss exclaims ""this is not Cubism darling, it's paint by numbers!"". Exactly. It is what it is - a no surprises solid little date/wife pic that is actually far better than it's cousin You, Me and Dupree."
1,Two solid actors ... one lousy script.,"Vince Vaughn is hilarious as a comedic actor and Jennifer Aniston is as talented as she is beautiful. One would think that this is a recipe for a landmark romantic comedy. As many have said, neither romance nor comedy exists herein. I blame this on a preachy script that is apparently written from a woman's point of view. The story is old, but seldom told: Man spots attractive woman. Woman attracted to man's clever come-on. A fun courtship commences and the relationship progresses. Couple moves in together. Domestic issues anger woman. Woman attempts to remodel man in her ideal image. Friction ensues. Ultimately, the movie culminates in a preachy tone that men need grow up and conform to the more mature domestic wishes of women or risk losing them forever. It seems a little condescending, but it is scary in its realism."
2,I'd break up with him too!,"The Break-Up starring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston is an unfunny, boring, and tepid film. The only reason I am giving this film two stars instead of one is because Aniston has never disappointed me acting wise. For me, she has never given a bad performance no matter how terrible the script was. Vaughn on the other hand is so annoying in this, he's just a bad actor - I don't understand what Aniston saw in him off-screen? He has no appeal and you just want to punch him in the face! I just hated the lame premise, there was no point to this film - such a waste of time. Bravo to Aniston for keeping me half interested."
5,Very Very Good Break Up Story...,"Certainly not a feel-good romantic comedy movie, but the script was well written. The story about a couple fighting and breaking up might seem ordinary, but this movie seems to have hit home. It is as realistic as it can be. Though many people expected the ending to be positive, I think the movie's choice was better. Jennifer Aniston continues to charm us with her natural beauty and talent. While I'm not a big fan of Vince Vaughn, I'd say he's quite good here in this movie as he portrayed a very typical sloppy guy attitude. It just looked very natural, very common and realistic.It's not one of those movies that ends and makes you wish life were like that to you. This movie may disappoint some coz it didn't end the way they like it, but it's kind of like a wake-up call for men and women out there. Men don't know what they're missing, until they've lost it."
4,Good movie. The drama was believable.,"The dialogue. The dumb guy. The tit for tat. The movie was like watching a real-life story unfold before your eyes. Vince Vaughn played a very convincing hard-headed guy who doesn't know any better about how to please his woman.20 minutes into the movie and the couple is an obvious mismatch. She makes an effort to salvage and the dumb guy doesn't even make an effort.The bad vibes that are shown throughout the whole movie are intense. Room for comedy where the Vaughn character greatly underestimates his ex-girlfriend's determination to get him to leave the very nice apartment they share. With him doing the same.I try not to miss this when it shows on cable, but really I will have to get my own copy just as soon as my ""disposable income"" gets back up to a comfortable level.I found this movie, in my opinion, to be very good. Strongly recommend."
1,why not zero stars ?,"because its not allowed. please remember, this movie is not funny..period. the ads are misleading. it is also a straight up horrible and mean spirited film. not even worth a rental"
2,2 1/2 Stars: Love Among The Ruins,"Vince Vaughn is quickly, successful film after another beginning with ""Swingers,"" becoming a comedy icon. His work is very funny and inventive for the most part...""Wedding Crashers"" for example. But, though he has some bright and crazy moments in ""The Break Up"" his humor is muted and along with the charming Jennifer Aniston he is asked to mostly bellow and wheeze through a poorly written script.The best Romantic comedies like the recent ""Two Weeks Notice"" (Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant) are smart, move quickly and feature funny second bananas. There is some heat between Aniston and Vaughn, the supporting cast is mostly good but after the first hour or so ""The Break Up"" falls apart and the situation between Vaughn's Gary and Aniston's Brooke degenerates into cruelty and not ""The War of the Roses"" intelligence-based, surrealistic cruelty but cruelty based on disrespect which is simply unpleasant to watch."
2,Not as good as the video game Vaughn was playing,"Vince Vaughn plays the role he always seems to be playing, fast-talking, testosterone-loaded male stereotype, and Jennifer Aniston grims her way through yet another personality-free performance in this yawner of a comedy-drama about two Chicago lovers in the process of breaking up. It would probably have been more entertaining to watch the rats swim in the Chicago River, for the movie peaked out when Aniston stiff-walked through a nude scene. Oh well, at least there were some nice shots of Chicago, and gangbangers will be on the lookout for the video game Vaughn was playing."
1,Ego trip to the movies,"One critic inverviewing Vince Vaughn asked him the one question that told me everything I needed to know. Watching this loser movie in person only confirmed my suspicions: Vince, stay with your acting, man. The question? How did your additional roles in this movie (in addition to acting that is) contribute to it?From beginning to end, it is one big self-gratification project for Vaughn and I'm sorry that Aniston lend herself to the role of Brooke. The storyline is poorly developed from the confusing beginning to the extremely anticlimactic ending. Jennifer has had much better roles, and I am very surprised that she would lower herself so much. I don't need to get into all the details, other people have done that already. But if you really want to see an incomplete story of a poorly matched couple's breakup, be my guest. Or perhaps your girlfriend (as in my case) really wants to see it and you really can't talk her out of it... Otherwise, save your money!"
1,What an absolute piece of GARBAGE!,"Just finished watching this ghastly, awful movie! What in the name of SANITY would make a lovely woman want to have a relationship with a man who is at best 12 emotionally? It is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen in the so called ""Romance Comedy"" era. Shame on all of you! This surely has sent the woman's moment back decades! A mature, lovely woman, is attracted to a self absorbed nothing....PLEASE! What a waste of time, energy and the money it took to make it! Argh...don't waste your time or money. NASTY! nasty...nasty!"
2,A comedy that set you on edge,"This wasn't a typical romantic comedy, especially not the way it was marketed. I don't know what's funny about uncomfortable, personal attacks between two people in front of their friends and family, not to mention the viewing audience.All through the movie I was on edge waiting for the next onslaught of bitter diatribe to begin between these two characters. It's like when you have to walk on eggshells around your house when your parents argue. Very tense.I watched the whole movie, waiting patiently for the ""romantic"" part of the movie to start. I expected the two characters to get over their differences, realize that they still loved each other, and get back together. The ending was not what I expected. It felt empty, hollow, and unfinished. Awkward. A very awkward ending; just like the meeting between the two characters at the end of the movie. Awkward. A good one word description of what this movie was all about."
3,It's so so,"It's worth watching and kind of a funny movie. To be honest I thought it would be much funnier than it was. It's mainly watching the two find new ways to irritate each other, some funny. It's not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it's not bad. It wasn't very expensive so give it a try you may end up liking it."
2,JEN AND VINCE FELL IN LOVE MAKING THIS MOVIE?!,"This movie had its moments, i thought Jennifer Aniston was very good in this. Im usually not a big fan of hers, but I like her in this, granted, I just could not buy that a women so put together and hot would into shlubby Vince Vaughn, the guy looks like Frankenstein. Some of the movie did not jive, like when she gets what she wants from him and her feelings have changed? It just seemed really abrupt, he had come a long ways with what he says to her..they also fight very nasty, I just dont think you can say the things that they say to each other and salvage anything, that's sorta slash and burn, and the end was sorta like..uh, ok..hummm...overall, not a great movie, but like I said Aniston is good and maybe worth a rent from netflix, but i would not buy it..i would not care to watch this again, once was quite enough."
3,They Saved the Best for Last!,"When I rented and viewed this movie I felt bored and my mind wandered; plus the theatrical version's ending left the movie and me flat. Then I watched the alternate ending on dvd and really enjoyed it! So thanks to the Tone Rangers and their rendition of the Rainbow Connection, I give the movie 3 out of 4 stars, but the alternate ending rates 4 out of 5 stars easy . . . so, enjoy!"
4,Loved this movie,I loved this movie. I thought it was funny. I only gave it 4 stars as I thought the ending was weak. I didn't like the alternative ending any better. I thought Jennifer and Vince were funny and had great chemistry.
1,A pointless waste of time.,"The Break-Up has Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston in the leading roles and their talents carry those roles well. The characters are not over the top but given realistic presentations. Unfortunately, this is where the good points of the movie stop. The story failed to carry any message, it failed to enlighten, it failed to inspire, it simply failed. The audience was merely given the opportunity to see a relationship disintegrate as though we can not see that enough in real life. Gosh, thank you so much. Even the meek attempt made to reconcile is met with a sudden change of heart, but the story fails to adequately develop the basis for this change and so the inevitable ending is reached. The relationship of the characters was a waste of time and my relationship with the movie was a waste of time."
2,Dasheikz 2 Centz: A Waste of Time.,This is a nice date movie but the ending sucked. Both characters were clueless about each other and were cruel to each other. Neither character appreciated what the other was offering. I felt sorry for these people @ the end. The parts that were supposed to be funny were. Not the worst movie ever but it's too depressing for no reason.
4,"It is not a comedy, it's a tragedy...",It's very unfortunate that a lot of guys are like Vince's character in this realistic movie. Jennifer Aniston is very good and very real.
3,Not a keeper,This was not one of the best films I have ever seen. There wasn't much for chemistry with Vince and Jennifer. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The story line leaves a lot to be desired but the actors really do try. I rated it a 3 for that reason.
2,"The Break Up - Please, Spare Me the Pain","FWIW - Overall, very little comedy in this movie compared to, say an older Adam Sandler film. I'm not saying there's nothing funny in the film, but the weight of the funny moments compared to the rest of the film is very small. If you buy the DVD, you will be paying to hear Vince Vaugh say GD 20-30 times. The movie leaves you with nothing to take with you. There is nothing about it that would make me reccommend it to a friend. The movie Sideways comes to mind when reviewing The Break Up, only because this was another movie in my opinion that left me with nothing, except the feeling that I had wasted a couple of hours watching it."
3,The Odd Couple,I really enjoyed this film. It tells a real poignant story about what happens in a relationship when people take each other for granted. The chemistry between Vaughn and Aniston was great Vaughn was flat-out funny especially Cole Hauser who played the younger brother. It wasn't the best Aniston film but it was still enjoyable. The supporting cast was great as well.
3,Painful to Watch,"I was expecting a romantic comedy. Although there were some comedic elements, The Break Up was too shrill and combative to qualify as a romantic comedy. Several scenes were uncomfortable to watch. Jennifer Anniston lacked her usual spark. Vince Vaughn's performance was lackluster.The constant yelling and bickering in this movie are about as enjoyable as the average joe's life in a broken home. There is very little humor here, and what there is is swept under by the constant in-fighting. This movie is not the least bit romantic either. The conclusion of the movie doesn't seem realistic, though I won't give it away. There is very little to praise about this movie.The script was also lacking. I would recommend that you not waste your money on this tripe. If you are looking for a light-hearted, feel-good romantic comedy, The Break-Up is to be avoided."
3,So So movie,This was a pretty decent saturday afternoon rainy day movie. Vince Vaughn wasnt his normal comdeic self but he was still pretty good as the boyfriend that just didnt get it.
2,"This movie was ok, but sucked at the same time","I laughed a few times in this movie but was more annoyed then anything..I was left with a horrible feeling in me after the movie was over..If I wanted a downer of a ending I could just go out and watch the the different [...] that happens in the world....I waited for a long time to rent this movie, now I wish I never had rented this movie because my money I spent will go to support movies like this....What a waste of time....BBBBOOOOOOOO!!!!! All the hype was built up into a bowl of [...]....."
2,This is not a romantic comedy,"When I saw this film it looked like a promising comedy, but turned out to be a drama. All the trailers pointed to it being a comedy so I went to see it. I was disappointed in that it did not make me laugh and both Jennifer Aniston's and Vince Vaugn's characters were not likable. I was just mostly bored watching the movie.This tale of lovers at the end of a relationship would have been handled better with other actors not that I think Jennifer and Vince are bad, but they just don't seem to fit these characters."
1,Not worth your time,"What a disappointment! The acting was poor, the plot undeveloped, and the ending was a wash-out. My husband and I enjoy Jennifer Aniston and that is why we went. She is a much better actor than this; however she was the only one to hold the film together at all. The chemistry between she and Vince Vaughn was nil and the other actors were simply awful. Do not waste your time or money...obviously we did not like it!"
2,Boring,The fighting and bickering gets old. Not really funny just a lot of uncomfortable fighting. If you are expecting a romantic comedy this isn't it.
3,"Had to watch it for a class, still funny but also kinda sad.","Gary Grobowski (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke Meyers (Jennifer Aniston) meet at a baseball game by a pushy (no surprise) Gary Grobowski. The movie goes fast forward past the mushy phase of the relationship and we find that Gary and Brooke are living together in sin and they are having issues. Gary is selfish and immature and Brooke is passive aggressive and a horrible communicator. They essentially go thru a mini ""War of the Roses"" and finally split the condo they bought together. Gary grows up a bit and Brooke is happy. Solid performances by Jon Favreau and Jason Bateman. The End."
3,Just ok...,"I went to see this movie in the theatre so of course some parts were going to be funnier than watching it at home. However, some parts of this movie were lackluster and weren't as funny as they were intended to be. Jennifer was portrayed as some wierd nagging woman, that took the movie to a wierd place. Vince was still pretty hilarious throughout but his friend almost stole the show with his i-spy tactics and assumptions. LOL The ending was terrible and very awkward. Maybe next time they'll do better when making a film with stellar actors. P.S. The singing at the dinner table was such a snooze fest."
3,Breaking up is Hard to do,"Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston star in the very funny hard bitten comedy ""the Break Up"" about a broke up couple living under the same roof with feuds over the things they do in their condo. It's a romantic comedy without romance, a funny & entertaining movie, a good american comedy. If you like Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston see ""the Break Up"""
4,Loved it!,"This was a good ""slice of life"" movie. It was also very real about what happens in relationships, which I believe was the point of the movie. Someone mentioned that the ""fight"" that started the downfall of the relationship was random. They apparently missed a lot, because that was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak. They didn't break up over that one thing.I was disappointed in the ending, but then had to remind myself of the title of the movie - and so it was appropriate."
3,Will this movie ever end?,"I didn't enjoy this movie at all, really! Vince Vaughn was very dull, and I thought that he was boring. I hated when they fought and how the movie ended. The whole time I was thinking ""When will this movie ever end?"" Of coourse eventually it did and I got to go on with my own life. If yoou think this is a romantic comedy, you are in for the longest hours of your life. Recomend it? Never!"
3,The Break-Up,"Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston) are the perfect couple, until one evening when everything falls apart. During the huge fight, we out Brooke thinks Gary is lazy and thoughtless, and Gary thinks Brooke is too controlling and unappreciative. She dumps him, but neither of them want to give up the condo that they own together. They each mark their territory, and set about doing whatever it takes to drive the other out.Vaughn and Aniston are well cast, and have a chemistry together. Supporting cast, including Jon Favreau and Joey Lauren Adams as their best friends, do good jobs and help keep the movie moving. There are even some really funny scenes. Yet, something is missing. Perhaps the characters are not nasty enough to each other. Anyway, while somewhat entertaining, ""The Break-Up"" fall a little short of success."
2,"The Acting was Good, but the story weak and the ending was awful","As the others have said, I was expecting a romantic comedy and got a drama that had some laughs. The funny parts were funny, but the dramatic story was boring and the ending was blase. The high point was Jennifer Anniston's acting. She was great and could have done wonderful things with a better script. I think the problem with the movies she's come out with is that she is not choosing the right projects for herself. Vince Vaughn was good as well, but again the story was awful, and he could not save this movie. I would still see another movie by these two if they ever make one together again because they are very good actors and could do brilliant things with a better script."
1,That's two hours we're not getting back,"While my husband and I watched this unsatisfying, loosely-strung together, boring-fest, he fell asleep. When he woke up 15 minutes later he remarked, ""Looks like I didn't miss anything.""He was right. One can easily watch the first and last 10 minutes of this movie and then do something constructive with the rest of the time.This one star rating goes to the character, Marilyn Dean, who is the only character in this unemotive, string of half laughs, who displayed any type of comedic edge.Do Sukodu or something else instead of watching this time thief."
2,A let down!,"Another so-so movie for the lovely, talented and Oh-So-Sexy Jennifer Aniston. It's becoming obvious that Ms. Aniston has trouble choosing scripts as well as men. I had high hopes for this film, but it just never peaked. I ended up being bored and feeling sorry that JA was playing second fiddle to another B level leading man. Hell they even gave Mr. Vaughn lead billing over her. Jennifer is a bonefide A list leading lady and if she's going to keep doing romantic films she needs to insist on leading men of her own star stature or else pick a vehicle that she can run with as the solo star. Did she really date that duphus?"
1,I can't believe it??????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage I have ever seen. Aniston's character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him. That is total nonsense. I expected them to get back together in the end. Real people do not behave like this. Or maybe they do... it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country.
1,not happy at all,"the description said new and never used i had view it for the first time and all it did was skip and was fuzzy. I was not pleased at all with the DVD, but i can say it came pretty fast."
2,Not sure why watching a dysfunctional couple is so funny,"There are some hilarious moments in this movie, but overall it just reminds me of watching a dysfunctional couple, which is more irritating than funny. It seems the script just finds a bunch of frivolous reasons for Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn to fight, and then lets them yell their heads off. Think of divorced parents fighting, and you'll get the idea. The Break-Up just doesn't do a good job of drawing out the humor of the situations, and instead comes across as a bit too serious."
2,Mediocre,"It's not a bad idea: a movie not about how a couple meets and falls in love, but about the demise of their relationship. The problem is the execution. I just never bought that Aniston's character would fall for Vaughn's. Come on, no woman who loves art and works in an art gallery could be with a man who thinks Michelangelo painted the ""sixteenth Chapel."" And let's not even mention the fact that his character is a fat slob and that Vaughn looks like a mailman. I spent most of the movie hoping she'd get as far away from Vaughn as possible, and the ending (both versions) left me absolutely cold."
2,Breaking up is hard to do,"Jennifer Anniston and Vince Vaughn star in this movie which is labeled a romantic comedy. Neither the word ""romantic"" nor ""comedy"" can easily be applied to this film. It is the anatomy of the breakup of a relationship. She feels that she does everything for him and he doesn't appreciate it and he wants more freedom and space to do his own thing. What starts out as a simple squabble becomes frought with past baggage from the relationship and each of the partners does his/her best to hurt and ignore the other one. They continue to share their condo since neither one wants to move out, and this movie becomes drearier as it goes on. Don't rent it if your looking for a light and enjoyable movie."
1,More chemistry in a Microbiology lab,"What an unsatisfying movie; kept wondering every 15 minutes of the movie whether it would get any better. What a waste of Jennifer Aniston's talents (though this movie proves that she is infinitely better-looking than Angelina Jolie!). No chemistry between Aniston and Vince Vaughn whatsoever. NOT a romantic comedy because it lacks both: romance and comic. If you like Aniston, watch 'Rumor Has It' instead; it is infinitely better than this."
2,Can't believe I wasted my time!,"This wasn't a very entertaining movie at all. I guess I am one that likes to be happily entertained when I actually find the time to spend ~2 hrs in front of a movie and this just didn't do it. I was annoyed most of the time I watched it. The ending stunk too. Like another reviewer pointed out, Jennifer A.'s character had all these things she wanted him to learn, and then, when he 'goes there', she still walks away. Don't waste your time!"
1,Awful Movie,"They do nothing but fight, bicker and and finally break up. What a waste of film, time and money."
2,god awful...,"With such a good cast, you would think this movie would be good, But its just plain terrible. It's more drama /dark comedy that a regular comedy. There is a funny part about every 25 minutes but overall this is almost painful to watch."
1,STUPIDLY BORING,"This was the biggest waste of my time and money. You keep sitting through the movie thinking, ""ok, it is going to get better. They are actually going to work it out."" And then, the disappointing end comes and you wonder what was the story supposed to be about anyway: How people can hurt each other? How well people can fight and nag each other? How expressing your true feelings in the end doesn't get you anywhere? What a waste of talent for these actors!"
5,Irish Country House,Thank you Irish Georgian Society for a wonderful film about the beautiful and endangered Irish Country Houses. Please make a follow up film on even more of these wonderful houses.
3,Less than perfect recording of the Gorecki Third,"The Gorecki Symphony No. 3 is a phenomenon in 20th century music. Imagine a piece of contemporary classical music attracting listeners in droves! This simply does not happen all that often.I bought this CD, as I quite liked the Naxos version with Antoni Wit. I reccommend the Wit version unreservedly. It is even better than the Zinman/Upshaw version on Nonesuch. This version is attractive, but unfortunately, it seems to lack the spirituality of the other two, especially the Antoni Wit version. It is quite a creditable performance, but I would reccommend going with Zinman or Wit instead. I reccommend the Wit especially. At $8, it isn't that bad a deal!"
2,Not much of a challenge,"This is a disappointing puzzle book. The puzzles are small - easy to complete in a short sitting. Although they are progressively harder as the books goes on, they are not much of a challenge. Thumbs down on this one."
2,I didn't like this CD...,"The problem with this CD is that is has one Beat for all the songs. I can only say ""got a little money to burn"" so many times. And ""she driving me cazy"" The same beat over and over drove me crazy.."
3,"English-Spanish, Spanish-English Electrical and Computer Eng",A good resource although it does lack acronyms.
1,USELESS DICTIONARY,"I do not know how useful this dictionary may be for a computer engineer, but it is certainly useless for a technical translator especializing in software manuals and software localization. The editor obviously has a feeble grasp of terminology concepts and of computers themselves, so the entries are not really terms, but words picked up somewhere, god knows where. I know, the problem is there are no (good) spanish-english software dictionaries out there!"
2,This is a list of words with a translation,"If your looking for a book with just a simple translation this is it. For example, ""boolean"" is provided with a dozen different types (e.g. boolean algebra). ""Boot"" is given 2 possibilites ""manguito aislador"" and ""cubierta aislante""; when to one or the other? and are these related to ""boot your computer""?No definitions or pronounciations anywhere in this EE word translator; definitely not a dictionary (i.e. no definitions).It does have many 2 or more word translation; ""tuned line"" phrase provided: ""linea sintonizada"". Can't find that in any English to Spanish Dictionary but what does it mean and how to pronounce it is not provided."
1,Could this book be any worse?!,"I began reading this book with an optimistic outlook. I thought it would be good because it's about a girl who is put into new surroundings and tells of her life, and how she deals with these new things. I read half the book, and it was still kind of slow so I thought, I'm only half way through it so it will probably get better... Well let me tell you, It DIDN'T! I could barely finish it it was so bad! I do not recommend this book for anyone, unless you just like boring stories. I would definitely give this book a negative rating, but one was the lowest number."
2,Just didn't like it,"I picked ""The Book of Fred"" up on recomendation from a local bookstore, and I just couldn't get into it. While the premise was rather interesting, I found that it lacked strength in the execution. The voices of the four characters telling the story were not particularly compelling or insightful."
2,Book Of Fred,"The reason i would have to rate this novel a 2 out of a possible 5 stars is due to the fact i didn't like the type of book it was. This book dealt with family issues and as a reader i enjoy a historical book or a thrilling novel. Also the other reason I did not like this book is due to the author Abby Bardi jumped from character to character and this really turned me off to the book. Although this book was well written it was not my kind of book, and i didnt like the constant character changes."
5,WHAT AN AMAZING VISION!,"MY FATHERS EYESI play it over and over. Can hardly bear to take it off. What a powerfully compelling lyric. Just three little verses, and so much musical feeling! It fills my empty room. A glimpse into something unique.He is one of the great gituarists, granted. But an exceptional singer as well. How does this happen? I've admired him since CREAM, and this only adds to it."
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought the Pyle-Pro PDWM96 Lavalier Wireless Microphone System, which was offered as an add-on with a portable PA system, with some doubt as to the quality I could expect for $13. My doubts were justified by the product. The microphone quality was atrocious, very crackly and fuzzy. I found it useless as a mic. I was pleasantly surprised therefore, to discover that the body pack, with the microphone unplugged and replaced by a patch cord connected to an mp3 player, makes a passable rf remote for music. (I have a Magic act, and background music has always been awkward to use, when I had to leave the stage to queu music and sounds etc.)This device has proven to be a cheap and reliable solution to the problem.Pyle-Pro PDWM96 Lavalier Wireless Microphone System"
1,pyle-Pro,I bought this from Dependable Resource. This is the Worst product I have ever bought. It did not work well right out of the box. I accepted a replacement even when everybody is telling me Pyle-pro products are the worst in the market. The replacement is taking forever. I have been told by Dependable Resource to expect a replacement for more than 3 weeks and it is no where to be found. My 1 star rating is bcos I cannot post this without rating the product. it is actually a Zero rating from me for the product and poor customer Service from Dependable Resource.
1,Lavalier Wireless Microphone System,"I can not say anything good about this product, i do not advise this product to anyone, it is very cheap cheap Chinese sh..."
1,Terrible,"The microphones barely worked, the audio quality was terrible, and you couldn't turn the mic volume up too high without tons of feedback. NOT worth the price i paid."
1,Don't waste your money -- would give 0 stars if available.,"This is awful! It has never worked. You must hold mic to your lips for any sound, and that sound is bad!Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Garbage,"Well, this product is just horrible. That's all I can say about it. It feels cheap in the hands, like assembled in a chinese sweat shop. The microphone is only mono audio only, so don't even bother!"
2,"One works fine, the other does not","These worked great the first day. After that, one out of the two I bought continued to work.They also pick up interference easily."
1,Bought used 1 time and now its not working,Bought the pyle wireless mic system to add to an existing microphone system I have. I was skeptical because of the inexpensive price $13 but I purchased anyway. Used the wireless mic one time just testing it out and it seemed to work well for the money but it quit working shortly after that. I changed batteries and still nothing. I have come to the conclusion that you get what you pay for and would never advise anyone to waste their money and time on this unit.
2,wireless blech,have yet to successfully make this work at all. at the best of times it is noisy and not suitable for presentation in a small classroom
1,Bad quality,"Terrible quality I want to returned them! Don't bother me regarding this item again, thank you Kandi Smith So Long"
1,pretty good,This mic is ok but there are a few bad things about it its pretty staticy at times case its wireless and you can't put two mikes at the same time as it beingone of them
2,Not sure about this one.,"This product would not work with my existing technology. But it may very well be a fine product, just not right for me."
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality but I guess you get what you pay for, I can not recommend this to anyone.Pay more and get something better."
1,Horrible unit,"This unit is basically worthless. It does not, has not and likely never will perform as advertised. The manufacturer wants to charge twice what was paid for it for return and exchange shipping. I guess I should have know when the opening line on the users guide reads: ""It is very happy that you have this professional Wireless Clip-on Mini."". In fact it is very UN-happy. Spend a little more and get something that works. Don't waste your money."
4,small price-good result,"Bought for domestic use, famely party, works very well inside or out, one thing to remember, never use it to close to the speakers, otherwise, a great choice."
3,It's OK,I bought two of these over E-Bay last year to film some weddings. I put them right into the camcorders. When I got to the wedding I was mad to learn that the groom wanted to use it on the preacher (the wedding was outside). They put the reciever into the PA and it worked fine. For a different wedding I put one on the groom and it made for some good video. Keep in mind though that the quality is cheap and they aren't reliable. I'm going to invest in something better for my sisters wedding this month.
1,"It does work, sort of!","We wanted a decent wireless mike for a group presentation. At this cheap price, this one seemed worth a try. We should have known better. It does work -- sort of -- but it is very cheaply made. The plastic is extremely fragile. The battery cover on the receiver broke immediately so it won't stay on. The little plastic carrying case ripped its seams on the first use. The sound quality is poor, more toy-like than professional. After a few test runs, we gave up on this and will get a ""real"" one."
4,Great back up.,"I use this as a great back up. Strong coverage and great range, it reaches the 30 feet I need for my presentations."
1,total junk,I tried this with four different microphones and two different amplifiers. Very noisy receiver. Terrible wireless connect even at three feet. straight to the trash can - totally worthless.
3,Inexpensive Wireless Mic Set.,"If you don't have the money then this one will do but, if you have a business where you need to sound professional I would spend a little more money on a better system. This is more for the non professional, it gives a lot of feed back but what can one expect for $13.00 but again if you are on a very small budget then this will get the job done just don't expect to sound like your at a concert hall because it will not happen with this set but to address a small non professional group it will work just fine."
1,Poor product quality,"We used this at our church for 3 weeks. The 9V battery is very hard to get into it compartment for the remote unit, and even harder to get cover on the same. Needed to replace it the 2nd week and couldn't find any 9V battery to fit in compartment. The unit is noisy during use and the audio is distorted and hollow."
1,Would not recommend these!,I purchased these for use on a stand alone 500W Pyle PA system and they induced noise and had horrible voice quality. I did purchase two units and received both the red and the green led units and they worked together fine but the quality of the produce is just poor and then static which was produce from the units which made them very undesirable for me. I repacked them and returned them the same day I received them.
3,It works.,"It works. I guess. Maybe I haven't tuned it in well enough, or maybe I just need to use it with a different Mic, but there was just too much noise to get clean sound for film purposes. I could see it being useful at a small event or something where it'll only be amplifying though"
1,Performance,Didn't function well. Poor transmission. Would loose signal when user got more than 15 feet away from receiver. Poor microphone pickup. Microphone would not detect voice unless held close to mouth. Overall Very unsatisfied with quality.
2,subpar quality,The product works but you can notice right away that the quality is poor. I didnt know anything about transmitters and thought maybe it could transmit my voice a short range . My voice comes through but it looses quality. Its like comparing a expensive stereo to a pocket radio.
3,Very good so far,"So far it works perfectly and has good range. Only issue is that its very sensitive but that is easily adjusted.I am satisfied with the product, no complaints here"
1,Worthless piece of junk,This mike doesn't even work well a Pyle amplified PA system. Battery covers will not stay on. You must speak directly into the mike and prepare for total distortion and feed back from the amp. Wouldn't reccomend to anyone.
1,1965 USSR / Svechnikov,"The 1965 USSR recording conducted by Alexander Svechnikov completely captures the magnifience of the beauty in the russian litergical chant. In solists, choir and conducting, no others in my collection compare with the 1965. Read my review of this one and others on the Polyansky/Moscow Classics label.The 1965 on Chant Du Monde, sadly long out of print."
3,New and Fresh,"I am also a hip hop artist, and this album is new and refreshing. It has a pop feel and yet the beat and the lyrics keep it real to home. This is the future of hip hop. I also checked out tommyshows.com and was very impressed."
1,Works good but smells terrible,"I got the marker for my moving boxes and after writing on a few boxes I was overwhelmed by the smell. I understand all markers has similar smell due to the chemical they use, but this can't be good for you. I just couldn't stand it and threw it away."
1,Merchandise not as pictured!,"In the picture for these markers there are three (a red, blue and black marker). Then when you receive your package there is only a single blue marker enclosed. Bait and switch, or just bad business? Who cares: Don't order these!"
1,Not actually Magnum markers...,"This seller sends the much smaller ""King Sized"" markers instead of the ""Magnum"" markers when you order these. If you want the larger markers you have to order the ""Magnum Oversized"" markers.If you think that's confusing and misleading, you're right."
4,ok,"I use this for figure skating coaching on ice- so I write on the ice with the marker so kids can follow patterns. It seems to be the best marker for this use. I don't know how it could be improved, but my coworkers and I feel that the markers run out pretty fast. I bought in bulk because I use so many of these markers. Maybe Sharpie can think of a new ""write on ice"" formula... haha."
4,"Red Sharpie Magnum 1/2"" permanent marker","This wide marker is GREAT for producing signs and posters. However, I suggest you use it in a well-ventilated area."
1,Deceptive description - not really a dozen,"They sell you a dozen (""Sold by the dozen"") and deliver one pen. Don't buy from TCP Global Corp."
4,Markers could last for a while longer.,"We go through these markers like water at our business. Our only complaint about these markers is that we never seen to get too much writing out of them before they die. With such a large volume for ink within the body of the marker, it seems like they should last a bit longer...As far as markers go, these are the best out there, but they still aren't fantastic."
2,Review From a Future Critic,This book wasn't so complicated that it is one of the best books there are. In fact if you're expecting it to be a bit good you're in for a disappointment. But still there's enough action for it to pass as worthy of its main character being Superman. Plus I don't like magic very much. If you have magic powers why don't you make a spell that kills Superman. You shouldn't just fling things at him like you can with simple telekinesis.
2,Does NOT ship quickly and DOES not coorespond,"In the introductory information they say it takes 4-14 days however its been 7 days and they have not shippped or responded to any communication. At this point they are still within the days that they promise but have not shipped from what I can tell.Terrible customer service in my opinion. I wonder if we will ever get the book. Everyone knows these text books are being used for school so why would they take so long to ship. I ordered 6 books using amazon and have been thrilled with all execpt this one. If book is received I will post another review, I guess its possible they are not linked with Amazon and have already shipped but its no showing up, but why no communicaton, I guess they could be poor at using the tool with Amazon."
2,seller & book review,"Seller forgot to send my product initially. I had to call and remind them to send it, which they did without further incident. It was in great shape."
5,A Great Reference For The Scratchbuilder,"This is a gem of a book that tends to be hard to find. It is rare to find any reference book on this sort of topic which walks the reader through the entire process from start to finish. Although the topic is limited to the aforementioned cottages, the book is very descriptive in terms of how the modeling was done. Techniques are detailed, and the information gained here is easily transferable to other scratchbuilding efforts."
5,John Lee Hooker & Friends,Great CD. I brought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it! I would highly recommend it to others.
3,short and mixed up,"To begin with, this collection of eight live recordings, while it *does* feature John Renbourn, actually consists of one piece by Renbourn and Stefan Grossman (his frequent collaborator) from 1978, and seven by the John Renbourn Group (Renbourn + McShee, Molyneux, Roberts, and Sathe) from 1980. Second, the cuts are both seriously out of order, and beyond this sometimes have the wrong times attached to a particular track. Last but not least, the total program time is under 36 minutes, which is unforgivable at a time where 80 minutes of program will fit on a CD. The program itself is interesting, but sounds an awful lot like the studio versions of the same material. Sound quality is excellent. 'Even at the low price, however, kinda hard to recommend against the competition."
1,Human anatomy CD not book,"I need to get a return address on this product. I thought it was a book, but, when it was delivered, it was a CD."
4,Perfect for Musical Theatre fans,"If you are a fan of Musical Theatre, this is a must-have DVD. The performances are absolute classics. My only disappointment was the video quality, but I guess most of these were not really filmed with that in mind. Several are segments taken from old TV variety shows. Still, it's a treat to see them."
5,How Lucky Am I To Get This For One Of The Best Holidays Of The Century? And That's Half Of Why Of It's Amazing!,"I did see this on PBS just last year, I heard about the whole Evita and CATS thing, I automatically jumped at it, and kept on saying in my head ""I must have it"". So, this year my dad has ordered it for me and I should be getting it for Christmas but it's coming this month! I'm physced! I've always wanted to see half of ""Jellicle Songs For Jellicle Cats"" over and over. That goes for the song ""A New Argentina"". And I read in another review, it also has the song ""Buenos Aires"". Now I'm really excited! I bet Christmas will be just as fun now that Broadway's Lost Treasures will be mine to keep now and forever! (That's from Cats, you know?)."
2,Dissapointed,"To be honest, the only reason I ordered this DVD was that I thought Jennifer Holliday was on it. Living in the UK I never got to see the PBS broadcast and have never seen the Grammy award winning 'powerhouse' of her performing. This begs the question as to why if you type her name in the search engine this dvd comes up under her name. That said it was great to see Robert Preston (even if he was miming), Joh Raitt, Gwen Verdon & Chita Rivera. It was good to see Zero Mostel singing from Fiddler having only seen Topol on the London stage performing the role. All in all I give this 2 stars for those performances but would have given it 5 stars plus for Jennifer Holliday. Hopefully a continuation DVD will be released and I will finally get a chance to see her."
3,Clarity a Problem,"First, I would give the DVD a 5 star rating for the opportunity to see all those broadway numbers with most of the original casts. That is a treat, and something to treasure. But I gave it a three star rating, as it was so blurry, especially if you have a large television. Watching it on a smaller tv makes it clearer. Therefore, my question, is why was it not redigitized. I did not realize that some of the songs were lip-synched, until I read the earlier reviews. Seeing Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera together was a true treat. Hope they make more of these DVD's, but please spend the money and digitize them"
1,I didn't really like it,This book was more on the boring side for me. It was not very enjoyable either. She has to take care of her cranky Uncle Hendrik.
3,Useful for perspective,"I encountered this year 2000 book in a children's literature discussion group in 2007. It is, as it says, mostly common sense accompanied, valuably, by suggestions of genres and titles. I was sorry it wasn't quite up to date anymore. I suspect what the book was doing through three editions is as well and more sustainably done on the Internet. The pitfall of course is that the web pitches mainly what's new whereas as children's literature, like any other, is something that accumulates great work over the centuries. Take Me With You When You Go"
1,What a disappointment!,"There is something wrong with this book. My wife and I know something about nutrition. Reaven's book recommends a diet high in ""good fats,"" but he fails to distinguish between good omega-3 fats and bad omega-6 fats. He also recommends a diet with an astronomically high 45% carbohydrate, but he doesn't explain the difference between refined and unrefined carbohydrates. Reaven may have done a lot of research on Syndrome X, but I don't think he has any idea how to treat it."
2,A Tough Read,"The literary style made this very difficult to read; I was constantly drifting off. Also, despite all the explanations, this diet is basically the Mediterranean Diet. If you're interested in that, Low-Fat Lies: High Fat Frauds and the Healthiest Diet in the World by Kevin Vigilante and Mary Flynn is MUCH easier to read and use. Also they stress using heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, since polyunsaturated fats have been linked to colon cancer, something Reaven seems to have overlooked."
1,A tough read and a bad plan,"I found this book hard to get through. It reads more like a medical textbook than a consumer book. Reaven's ""Syndrome X Diet"" also doesn't make much sense, but I decided to give it a fair try. I ended up hungry virtually all the time and actually gained several pounds. If I would have kept on the diet, I'm certain my weight problem would have gotten even worse. Reaven may have coined the term ""Syndrome X,"" but as far as I'm concerned he's just another doctor who doesn't know much about nutrition."
5,At Long Last -- Science Instead of Hype,"Wow. This book was such a breath of fresh air. I have tried every diet there is and they always fail for me. This book rings so true. I have learned that for me, the extremely low fat diets are a nightmare. I actually gain weight on those. At long last, we have real scientific reasons why that low fat dogma doesn't work for everyone and can in fact be bad for people like me. It is so refreshing to have diet advice based on real science. This book makes sense for me based on my experience. It makes me understand WHY those other diets don't work for me. I am just starting to follow this diet, I have already lost 5 pounds, I feel great and am not starving all day. It is so good, I just bought one for my sister."
3,Doctor knows best,I've read a lot about low carbohydrate diets. Many are pop-science and threatening--do this or else. I guess that's what sells. But Dr. Reaven IS the person who invented the term syndrome X and knows the most about it from a medical view. The other books on the subject are more like cookbooks with a little dietary puritanism thrown in. This one is to the point on the medical issues.
1,Save yourself now!!,"Do not buy this book! It was terrible. I got a headache trying to decipher what the jumbled letters and punctuation marks were intended to be. There is little original thought, and that small amount is Omoike's opinion on an issue. I wish I could give it zero stars. I bought this book for a college paper and I'm not sure if I can find any usuable quotes!"
1,I can't believe this was published!,"If you are looking for a thoughtful analysis of the Columbine tragedy, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It is full of spelling errors(was this edited at all?) and offers little to no new details about the shooting, let alone any meaningful insight. I can't believe someone was paid to write this."
1,The Problem With Inexpensive Publishing...,"...is that junk like this ends up on the shelves and there are few ways for consumers to know beforehand that they're wasting their money. I'm a public school teacher who would have refused to grade this had one of my students turned it in. This book was unedited, full of incorrect facts, missing pages, and more. Don't waste your money or your time trying to plow through a book that should never have been published.School violence is a huge problem in the US and I know that many people are looking for books that dive into the topic. Find one that's worth it...this one is not."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"What a colossal waste of paper, time, and money! This book, if you can call it a book, was the most poorly written and edited document that I have ever had the misfortune to order. It offers absolutely nothing new to understanding the events of Columbine and the two people who carried out the violence. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Outstanding detective work again and double exposure,"Again contrary to expectations and to those who want to hide the truth, Omoike does it again. With outstanding detective work and analysis, he throughly exposes the real cause of violence in our schools. It is time some of these readers start being truthful to themselves and deal with teaching our kids real value. Ironic most of Omoike's analysis was research based on excerpted (quotations) from Denver Post and I had little time to look at low budget typographical errors. I was focused on the facts."
1,NOT RICH GIRLS,"I like the rest of you, found my way to this page looking for the MTV reality series ""Rich Girls"" on DVD. I must say its refreshing to know there are so many others out there that want the show to come out on DVD as I've been hoping for for years. But have NONE of you noticed that we are all commenting on ""Filthy Rich Girls""? A porno inspired by our favorite show? I mean COME ON, I'm sad to know that I'm among a group of such ditzes."
5,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY STUFF!!!!!!!,"I love love love love this show. It makes me laugh, cry, and just have agood night of TV. My friends and I have soo many inside jokes about this show and we quote to show all the time!!!! You all NEED NEED to buy this..I can't wait to get mine in the mail! Thank GOD it is coming out on DVD! My friends and I are gonna have a Rich Girls Party!"
3,Velour Mat 325i BMW,"I've had many car mats over the years and only changed them when I changed cars. I feel the velour is the best as it fits nice and it doesn't fade that bad. I love it, I think it could cover a bit more of my dash but that part is not in the sun so maybe it doesn't matter, but overall I love it."
2,"Too New Age for Pagans, Too Pagan for New Age","I purchased this book after reading the first few pages and perhaps I should have read further. The author asks much from the reader concerning her experiences with the supernatural,she seems to be trying to be a Casteneda without the trippy medicines. I found the writing to be quite good, but could not follow her ideas as well as I would have liked.Everyone she hangs out with is given a significance in her private pantheon, being replaced as they move on. Re-kindling the Celtic mysteries with your friends while looking down on neopaganism makes me wonder exactly who this book was meant for."
5,Excellent,"This is such a great game. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular. The sound is lovely. The puzzles are perfectly solvable, but challenging. There is some arcade, some adventure, some action. The levels are well designed. My only problem is that the controls are somewhat difficult. Still worthy of 5 stars, though."
1,Requires 3-D Graphics Card,"Since I have a new pc with gobs of capabilites, it did not occur to me to search around for system requirements for the Rayman 2 game. Pretty dissapointed to find out I would need another $100 investiment to play the game. It'll will be returned unopened."
4,"Excellent Graphics, Good Story, Better than Mario 64","First, the graphics are the best I've seen. There is actual mist above the water in the marshes and waterfalls. The ponds ebb and flow, the clouds roll by with a distinct realism, and the streams flow realistically, as do the bubbles and splashes. Shadows are realistically placed. The con to this game, if any, is the sometimes uncooperative camera, and the predetermined save points. Although, playing the levels more than once is enjoyable. I have 128mb ram, a tnt2 video card, a 40x cd rom, and digital sound card, with pIII 500mhz processor. runs perfect, no glitches."
2,Falls off,"I returned this item because it has no drawstring to secure it to the seat; it is simply elastic. When you sit down, the seat cover inevitably slides and falls off. The return, I must say, was handled promptly and courteously."
2,Purty People,"I know that many others disagree with me, but to me JAG is nothing but campy nonsense. It is nothing like the true military (I served, I know) and most of the episodes have little or nothing to do with military law or the kinds of things that JAG officers actually do. (A lot of dull paperwork, mostly--I am a lawyer, I know.) Mostly this series revolves around Politically Correct storylines with purty people flirting or otherwise fooling around. Good entertainment after a fashion, but not my cup of tea. RJB."
3,JAG review season four.,"The fourth season of JAG was not as good as season one, two, three, and five. These seasons had a lot of military ouside programs, which were great. Season four was shot mostly inside and reminded me of a play rather than an action television program."
5,jag-season 4,This season harritt finally has her baby and you learn more background on all the main characters.Like other seasons you see how the military enforces the rules and laws.
5,Happy first time buyer,This was the first thing I have bought on Amazon.com. I was very satisfied and would buy from this seller again.
5,Great Show,This was one of the best shows on T.V. The other being N.C.I.S. I rate both of these shows a 10 out of 10.
5,JAG the fourth season,The quality of this was superb....I would recommendanyone to shop at AMAZON...The service was great and theproduct arrived at my home as promised....Thank You AMAZON !!!!
1,the elusive republic,"The book was assigned by my history professor. The book is very hard to understand. The introduction can be a chapter alone.The words that were used didn't seem real,they were complex.I wish the book was never assigned."
1,Boring and hard to read,This book is filled with confusing terms and boring sentences. It is an extremely hard to read book. It jumps form one point of reference to another. This makes it unbearibly confusing. I would not recommend this book to any student or any teacher to use as a teaching tool.
3,"Good technique, disappointing content","This is a cheesecake book with disappointing content. The artist is quite talented, but without any real range. It's a good book if you like this kind of stuff, but don't expect to be blown away -- Luis Royo (for example) is far more interesting"
5,Hot Damn!,"I love Olivia and everything she does, including this book. I just received mine today and IMMEDIATELY sat down and ravaged it! It is glorious and refined. I have probably gone through it at least 17 times today and will go through it again another 17 times tomorrow. I never get tired of perusing the fantastic and erotic images she creates. I wish she would put out a book every 3 months! If you liked ""Let Them Eat Cheesecake"", you will fall MADLY inlove with this book, ""A Second Slice"" as well. It has inspired me to work harder and be more devoted to my own artwork. Hopefully it will inspirit you to do the same..."
2,Teaching Critical Thinking? Not.,"In my opinion, the authors should introduce evidence in The Evidence rather than making bold, uncorroborated statements in Questions to Consider (thus tainting the evidence with bias); however the authors are prone to guiding the reader to a pre-chosen conclusion. This, to me, is unconscionable in a book purported to help students become critical thinkers. The authors apparently use a different definition for ""critical thinker"" than I am familiar with. In truth, the book intends to be censor morum, teaching the student to become a politically-correct thinker.I loved reading The Evidence but I can really do without the editorializing in the other sections of each chapter. Allow the student to come to his own conclusions, I say. Unfortunately (or fortunately, rather) not all textbooks are equal.Caveat Emptor."
1,Piece of junk,"I have had this windlass on my 26' Crownline for part of last season and most of this one and it has caused me to cuss. As you notice it is rated for a boat up to 29ft. Most of the time the rope slips in the gear (someone has to put their foot or hand on the black lever to help the gear grip the rope) When it gets to the chain you can forget it grabbing at all! Yesterday I had to pull the anchor in by hand ( not the first time )and then use the windlass to feed the rope and chain into the anchor locker. I am using the 3 strand 1/2"" rope and 1/4"" chain like it calls for. I have only kept it on my boat this long because I haven't wanted to drop a $1,000.00 on a better windlass. But after yesterday I'm headed to the boating store. I have had enough. No more Lewmar windlasses for me!"
2,"""Barbie and Fifi go to Congress""?","This is the film currently playing on Aeroflot's flights from Moscow back to the USA. Talk about being a captive audience! The premise appears to be this: a ditsy blonde goes to Washington to pass legislation against animal-testing. All well and good, but the perkiness and bubblyness and blondness and all the pink, pink, pink outfits -- including her dog's! -- really start to get tiresome, FAST! I shut off my headset, thereby eliminating 50% of the irritation. But there's still all that PINK...! Yikes! The other annoying thing about this film is, it seems to go on darn near as long as the international flight. I actually found Aeroflot's destination maps and altitude/airspeed info more entertaining than this inane in-flight movie offering. Much as I despise the term ""chick flick"", I believe this film must fit its description."
3,Three and a half stars really,"I bought the first Legally Blonde on DVD as a lark and was very disappointed. I didn't find it funny or entertaining -- and in my book if a comedy isn't one it had better darn well be the other. I passed over the sequel when it came out on DVD thinking it would be more of the same but I wound up seeing it anyway and I was pleasantly surprised. Although the movie is somewhat simple-minded and innocent -- with a few scenes so cute they'll make you cringe -- generally speaking it was a very light hearted, enjoyable movie. I even found myself laughing out loud once or twice. Now, compared to some of the more serious movies that have come out on DVD as of late, such as the Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk (both with boring, convoluted plots) this was a light, welcomed change and, I dare say, a better way to spend a few hours and a few bucks."
3,As dumb as a blonde,"The first movie was fun and entertaining, but it has to said the second one did not quite meet the quality of the first. The first movie had a nice kick to it because it was classic and it was about things working out for a girl no one took siriously. But the second one tried but faild to follow out on that vibe and had no hook to it.what the three stars where and for:1 for being funny2 because Reese is a very good actress3 because it think it was a very cute movie with a very cute dog!the two stars that are missing... why:1 quality2 a good hook in the story lineI know many of you may disagree, but that is ok.P.S. the blonde joke was not ment to offend anyone... Im blonde!!! lol!!!"
2,THERE OUTTA BE A LAW...,"...against bad sequels, and this one is bad, despite the comedic deftness of Reese Witherspoon. Not even she can save a screenplay that is this bad. It lacks the snappy dialogue and clever madcap situations that elevated the prequel into the ranks of successful screwball comedies. This sequel simply tanks, in spite of Ms. Witherspoon's ever present, personal winsomeness. Despite her, this film falls flatter than a pancake, which is a shame, since the original Legally Blonde movie had been so charmingly funny.Unfortunately, this film is quite disappointing and simply not in the same league, despite the casting of the original star and some of the original supporting cast. Not even the addition of Sally Fields and Robert Newhart elevates this drivel to a film worth watching. Moreover, if you are not a fan of Reese Witherspoon, you should deduct one star from my rating."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I purchased this DVD a few years ago and still have not watched it all. I really enjoyed the first Legally Blonde movie. I am a fan of Reece Witherspoon and have several of her movies in my DVD collection.I found her performance as Elle totally over the top! Who ever wrote this script turned Elle into some kind of superhuman. Elle has the ability to change how Washington operates just by being Elle. (complete with the stupid snap cup congress voting routine)Although the cast was great, the script and the directing was sub-par. The director added a pink glow above Elle's head whenever she was in a scene.This was pointed out by the director in the DVD extra segment.Did he get this idea from Touched by an Angel? Thank goodness they never made Legally Blonde 3.Although Elle Woods' movie career maybe over,Reece Witherspoon's career continues to shine!I believe she has totally outgrown her Legally Blonde chararcter."
3,Kind of boring...,"I have to say that since I have not seen the first movie, I have little to compare this with. However, I did find myself getting bored with all this and would say that the first one sounds a bit better.Granted there are a few funny quotes and moments that will have you laughing, but overall I found myself nodding off during most of this film, waiting to watch ""kingdom of Heaven"".Though I have not seen the first, i will have to say its probably better. This was just okay for me."
1,Worst movie ever,"This movie failed to spark my intrist. The story plot was based on dogs,and the movie was very unbelieveable.The best characters in the movie were dogs and I'm not even sure If I like dogs. This movie has failed to become humorus. Inless you you want to be tortured and have a life full of misery, don't touch this cruel worthless item. The movie lacked a good cast, a decint story,Humore,and likingness. I personally think that the only people who could ever enjoy this pain are teenage cutsy blondes. Worst movie ever!!"
2,Reese saves this movie from doom.,"It's an alright chick-flick that a guy can watch...so stupid, it's actually kind of funny."
2,Lost the formula.,"I really have no idea what they were thinking here. I went to see this at the theater, psyched that it was going to be a repeat of the first. I was wrong. The first one is so much better than this. The only thing they are doing here is trying to pass the 'bruiser bill', which is not a very interesting subject for this sequel. I think Reese's character should have been putting some of her lawyer talent to better use with a completely different storyline. This missed the mark. If they happen to make another in this series, I pray that it's not like this was."
1,This movie sucked!,"I rented this movie last night...I was so excited as I loved the first one. All I can say was, huge disappointment! This movie was terrible. I'm happy I didn't spend $10.00 in the theatre watching it!All in all, don't even bother to watch this horrid sequel! It could have been much funnier, sadly the movie wasn't even close."
2,Should be Illegally Blonde,"As a huge fan of Legally Blonde I was so excited for the sequel. However, the attempt to revive vivacious Elle Woods highly disappointed me. Reese Witherspoon is an extremely talented actress and played her role well, but not even Reese's infectious Elle could hold up the plot. Her performance is the reasoning behing my two-star rating--without her it would have been a one! The script lacked the humour so evident in the first LB installment and quite frankly I don't remember laughing once. I found this movie so disappointing because I know it could have been so much better. Buy the first one instead!"
1,IF I could rate it ZERO stars - I would!,"I found the first Legally Blonde movie silly but fun. This movie doesn't have one moment worth watching. I won't bore you with a long review - but, trust me - rent or buy something else!"
1,A movie that underestimates it's audience,"This was one of those movies where you wonder, who thinks this is funny? Gay dogs and hiring a private investigator to find a dog's mother is just a few of the far-fetched plot lines in this movie. I did not like the story, it was really stupid ( I know stupid is a strong word to use, but I really think it is). As far as the acting, I've always liked Reese Witherspoon, she was great in Election, Cruel Intentions and Legally blond 1 as well as some other movies. But in this movie her acting skills were overshadowed by the story. It went on too long and at the end I just didn't care anymore.Do not rent this movie and expect it to be on par with Legally blond 1."
2,Legally Blonde 2-Red White & Blonde,"I was so looking forward to this movie as I loved the first one. I was sorely disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is adorable and always entertaining as Elle Woods, but the story lines were lame excuses for, well, story lines. Ends up bruiser is gay, and the wonderful ""perm climax"" from the first movie is sadly attempted as the climax of this movie as Elle compares making your voice heard to a bad haircut. There is hintings at the end that there will be a third. Please don't disgrace yourselves further."
2,Should Have Been Titled Really Dumb and Dumberer,"Ok, I will admit it, I truly enjoyed Legally Blonde, and was looking forward to the sequel, but having just left the theater, I feel dissapointed. The mindless world of El Woods was original and funny in the first movie, but this movie tries to be funny by repeating the same old jokes. There in lies the problem, this movie does not provide the laughs of the first film. And the part about gay dogs was a little over the top. This movie will be a set back for Reece Witherspoon, and her 15 million dollar per movie days are probably a thing of the past. Some movies just don't make good sequels, and unfortunately this is the perfect example."
2,Legally stupid,"Lackluster follow up to Legally Blonde finds our hero trying to save Buster's (Her dog) Family from being experimented on. So she goes to the capital to fight the good fight for tasted and class, and to change the system as well. It lacks the charm and feistiness of the original, and basically retreads the original plot of the first film in every scene. It's a decent rental thanks to Reese Witherspoon but it needed more to hold its own with the original."
4,"Legally Blonde 2:Red,White & Blonde",This movie is definetley good for a nomination but not a win I hope they did nominate it because it definetley deserves it. I thought after hearing good things and not so good things about this movie that I would not like it but it was good. I thought the funniest part was when Paulette said you look like a fourth of July it makes me want to have a hotdog real bad. Anyway this is a good movie if you want to laugh a few times. I don't know why they rated it PG-13 I thought it should of been PG instead.
2,Neh.,Usually I don't expect sequels to overpower the originals. I was especially right with Legally Blonde 2. The first one was a lot funnier and had a better plot. Even the DVD extras were weak. Jesus. the Gag Reels weren't funny at all. Sorry excuse for a sequel. I think they should have did something more to develop the new characters and at least put Luke Wilson in more scenes.
2,OK comedy,Rather than relying on the writers to come up with funny situations/dialog which the first movie had this movie relies more on over-the-top situations to try to be funny which isn't really my thing.
1,Legally Blonde 2,"The first one was cute, this one was stupid. Bought it for my wife. It was so silly I had to leave the room."
2,Disappointing!,"I am a HUGE fan of the first movie, so I had hoped that the sequel would have the warmth, humor and sparkle of the first. I was wrong.While there are a few genuinely funny moments, this movie was in large part unfunny and boring. I love Reese and Sally Field (and they both put in fine performances), but I left feeling amazed that either would sign on to the project. I can't put my finger on exactly what was missing, but this movie simply did not have the charm of the first one.It could just be the plot and the setting. In the first movie, it was hysterical that someone could just simply decide to go to Harvard law school, snag a top internship in their first year, and win a major criminal case. In the sequel, it doesn't work anymore."
2,Pretty Bad,I don't see how people could give 5 stars review for this flick. The whole time I though I was watching a Disney movie the humor was really bad and played out. The movie got ... boring and predictable fast ...
5,REMEMBER: IT'S A COMEDY!,"I loved this movie. I laughed more than I have in a long time. I have one suggestion for those of you who are weary about seeing it - KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IS A COMEDY. Too many people think that this is dumb movie because they forget that it is a comedy - even when Elle is crying. Reese does not cry like that in her more serious rolls. Granted you are not laughing out loud - a grin may come across your face, but you also are not supposed to take it completely seriously either. Just enjoy the comedy and great performances by the entire cast."
2,legally blonde 2,"I was so excited about going and seeing this movie that i went to the theatre and watched it. It was overall a cute girly girl type of movie. I was dissappointed, but thats me. I liked the first legally blonde better, this one isnt too bad. As in the first one she istn taken seriously, and she's trying to save brusters mom from being used as a lab animal, so she goes and fights for what is right, and of course its a happy ending---she wins. Very predictable movie, but everyone has a different opinion, so just watch it and see what you think."
2,OK if you are looking to a 'beach read' alternative,This film is like a 'beach read' book. It pases the time and that is about all.
3,such a disappointment,"I really liked the first one and was excited to see this movie, but I was very disappointed. They whole movie was about how Bruiser's (the little dog) mom was in an animal shelter and Elle was trying to get her out. There were some funny moments (snapping cup), but those were few and far between. There were too many jokes about Bruiser and another dog being gay. If you are from PETA, you will give a standing ovation for Elle's efforts, but if not, you will probably want to turn it off long before it's over."
5,Loved it just as much as the original!,"I was really expecting this movie to be awesome, because Reese is one of my all time favorite actresses. She captures any role she plays, and she has done it again! I love the storyline, and there is alot of humor here. I'm glad to see alot of the original cast in this one...all of them in fact except for the characters Warner and Vivian whom are not in this film. Jennifer Coolidge is also very funny and full of wit again in her role as Paulette...such a great movie! Reese plays Elle once again, and this time, when Elle finds that her dog Bruiser's mother is locked up and being used for cosmetics testing, takes the fight against animal testing all the way to Washington DC! With a few plot twists and turns and some laughs along the way, this movie is a triumph! You will love it as much as the original if not more! Don't miss out...""join the party!"""
1,"Horrible, Irrational Waste-of-MY-time","Although I ADORED the first Legally Blonde movie, I thought Legally Blonde 2 was absolutely retarted! Reese Witherspoon always does a great job in any movie she is given, and this one was no exception. But who wrote this plot? It was completely irrational [but maybe that's how it was supposed to be]. That being said, I didn't enjoy it, and neither did my husband.Besides the plot, I have another huge complaint with this movie! Elle Woods's dog, Bruiser, turns out to be a gay dog, which went well with the completely irrational, retartedness of the movie. The person who came up with that surprise needs to get out of the movie-making business. And it didn't even stop there. At the end of the movie, the two dogs are ""married."" I cannot express how much the part about Bruiser being gay rubbed me the wrong way.I figure I'll get a bad review for my opinion of this movie, and so be it! This movie was just wrong."
2,Fail,"If you are starting to watch this movie thinking it will be like the first legally blonde movie, STOP! this movie does not hold to the same quality that the first movie had. First off in this movie you see Elle getting all worked up about her dog's family being animal testers (not that I support this, I don't but... really?) Is in it a lot more bigger problems in the world to tackle other than a family of a dog to go to her wedding?I guess I am just disappointing by how similar they try to make the plot but how much it fail in delivering."
2,It's like watching a trainwreck...,"I really loved the first legally blonde movie. I enjoy watching Reese Witherspoon as an actress in many movies, but Legally Blonde 2 was like watching a trainwreck. Although, the story was horribly contrived and way over the top...one who starts watching it, cannot help but see it to the end. From the moment that Elle went to a private detective to find brusier's mother...I felt like banging my head against the wall--from there it only got worse.If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and rent it. It is not worth buying."
3,mmm..........it was alright,"Legally Blonde 2 was not as cute and pep as the first one. It was... to put it bluntly a bit bland.The characters replay everything from the first, and Elle's optimism factor isn't as cute. The plot for the first movie was a bit realistic, whereas the plot for this movie was completely off base. So Witherspoon and her co-stars may have gotten a few smiles and even laughs, but if you're looking for an extremely well-made movie, go see something else. Basically this is the kind of movie you go see with a group of friends, so it won't be completely stupid. I reeeaaally hope they won't continue with this movie so far as to make Elle run for president. In conclusion, if anyone asked me what I thought of the movie, I would say, Cute, corny, and pretty dumb....don't expect a highly moving, or funny flick."
1,A Shallow and Pointless Sequal,"Having recently seen ""Legally Blonde"" I was thrilled to hear that the sequel, ""Legally Blonde 2"" was coming out. Yet upon seeing what I had hoped to be a funny, witty and charming film I found only a rediculous, humorless, and ultimately shallow film. The acting ranged from average to bad, but honestly I did not expect much in this department. The jokes, which using politics as a platform, should have been histarical but they were only a rehashing of the first film. What litte new material was used in this film was pratically pointless and gained more sighs and groans then anything else. ""Legally Blonde 2"" is in short, since to even mention the inane plot would be a waste of everyone's time, a lackluster summer sequel. If you have not seen the first film watch it, it is a very charming movie. Those whom have seen the original, as well as those whom have not, are just a well to save your money and avoid this trash. Rated PG-13 for adult lanugage and sexual humor."
2,Can't compare it to the first one,"I was very disappointed by the movie - it doesn't even come close to the wit and fun of the first Legally Blonde. Granted, I did have a screaming boy who loved to kick seats behind me for most of the movie, so I may have missed a couple of good lines, but still the characters seemed more annoying than charming and fun. And ""Snaps for Congresswoman Hauser..."" Please. Just a little too much on the fake site. My recommendation is wait for the video."
1,absolute garbage,"This is as pathetic a movie as I have ever had the misfortune to watch ( although I could not watch it all, I have to admit )Naturally, it has a stupid plot, so did (say ) Freaky Friday, but this ""homage to artificial sweetener"" is as far removed from that movie as you could get. There is nothing clever, engaging or entertaining in this ridiculous piece of garbage and it really is a sin to waste time watching it.I am not going to say more, because that would stop you moving on to reviews of another film possibly worth watching."
1,Legally Blonde 2,"I was very disappointed with Legally Blonde 2. The first Legally Blonde movie was great, but I would not recommend this sequel. The script and storyline are weak and the film just does not have the charm, the wit and the freshness of the original. Legally Blonde 2 is a blatant propaganda piece representing a specific political viewpoint that may not necessarily be embraced by the whole audience. It's a free country, and political films are fine, but they usually do better in a documentary format rather than passed off as popular entertainment."
2,What a snooze fest.,"Legally Blonde 2 - Red, White & Blonde is a very disapponting sequel to the blockbuster hit 2001, Legally Blonde. I love the original so much but the this one is slow, boring, has a stupid premise, and Reese looks like she hated filming this movie. All the magic is gone, people still treat Elle like she is an idiot. Sally Field's character is heartless and cold as well, Luke Wilson makes a brief apparance as Elle's boyfriend and yes they do get married in the end. This sequel focuses on Animal Rights in Washington D.C. Elle worries about the safety of her dog, the adorable Bruiser but I just couldn't get in to the story or new characters. Poor Reese, she is a wonderful actress, but maybe she should have read the script again before she agreed to take this sequel head on. Forget this film, buy the original instead."
1,The best I can say about this one,"The best I can say about this one is that after this movie there is little danger if us being subjected to ""Legally Blonde 3"".I enjoyed the first one. It was funny, fresh, imaginative and Reese did a fine job in the part - keeping a balance elements that defined the role.This movie was just full of pretention, re-treat gags that were funny the first time but tedious the second time.This was apoor effort that ruined the experience of the first Legally Blonde."
1,Trailers are deceiving!,"I loved the original. It was hilarious and the story was great. With the sequel, the plot became ridiculous. I know it's different writers this time but I didn't imagine they would create a story this bad. The entire Bruiser situation and Delta Nu things was way too much silliness. Reese does a great job as Elle. She's still the same upbeat, strong and positive girl but the story....I can't explain how dissapointed I was. Also, even though Elle pretty much does everything she wants, Emmett (Luke Wilson) doesn't even try to convince Elle how ridiculous it is to find Bruiser's mom. It just doesn't seem real. The trailer is funny. It makes it as though it's going to have the same elements as the original but it lacks just that really bad. PLEASE consider hard about whether you should watch this. I don't even reccommend people renting it because that's still a waste of money. Stick w/ the original. And I'm hoping that the crew will realize that a third should not be made."
1,Illegally Bad Movie,"I honestly could not believe how pitifully bad this film was. The first one was actually pretty funny; but this one was painful. To add injury to insult, the movie ends abruptly! At the end you are left wondering if they ran out of film in the camera, couldn't decide how to finish, or just felt like they had tortured the moviegoers long enough and might as well call it quits. Don't go see this one in the theater. It's not worth the [money]."
1,Legally speaking: AWFUL,"Oh my, oh my. Just finished watching this DVD and the first thing I have to say is I'm glad I was still in a free trial period for my DVD rentals. Even at 2.99 I would have been rather annoyed, but at the full retail movie theater prices; I would have been very upset.This movie just never takes off and never gets you into the whole premise: animal rights.This movie falls into the trap of so many that have tried to capitalize on the success of a first: No real plot, just get the same people doing the same thing and it should work. The movie drags on and by the end, you really just want to return the stupid movie to your local rental store.The ""bonus"" material is a joke: you get the music video (who cares) and outtakes (aren't those standard on every DVD now)?Simply put, leave this on rental shelf and grab a different movie. You'll at least have a better chance of watching something entertaining."
1,It should be illegal to make such a bad movie,Unlike the first leagally blonde which I loved this one was terrible! I wouldn't even bother renting it! It has a dumb plot and you should stay away! I lost my attention in the first 30 minutes!
2,Would have been funny if it had lived up to the first.,"I'm really disappointed to say that Legally Blonde 2: Red, White, and Blonde wasn't funny. I was very suprised at how stupid and boring it was after the hilarious Legally Blonde in 2001. There is not one funny new character, all the new ones are stale and boring. Even most of the old characters such as Paulette and the rest of Elle's friends are bland and/or annoying. The only reason I'm giving this more than one star is because Reese Witherspoon's performance, like last time, is perfect for the role."
1,The magic is gone in this sequel,"Legally Blonde was a pleasantly enjoyable film, but the sequel has none of the fun, magic or charm that made the original so much fun.In this sequel, Elle goes to Washington DC and struggles to enact a law banning cosmetic testing on animals. The jokes are stale and the plot is silly and unbelievable. Putting Elle on display in the capital might have been the problem, because in the first movie, Elle being a lawyer was at least somewhat plausible.This is one sequel that should have never been made."
2,"Talented actors, horrible story","I loved Legally Blonde. It was funny, irreverant, silly, and just plain entertaining. I just can't say the same about its sequel. How can you assemble a cast like this and give them a stinker of a story? I can't believe this is the best they could do. Rent it before you buy it. You'll save yourself some dough."
3,It was almost there!,I loved the first one and adore Reece Witherspoon's acting however by then end of this one I was gettin the 'is it over yet?' symptoms. The movie had the base to be a great movie- it was just lacking something. Either the actors were trying too hard to get it to be as good as the first OR it carried on too long and I got bored with it :( It was funny though! I love animals so I was able to stick with it- my boyfriend fell asleep though.
2,a disappointment,"Legally Blonde is one of my favorite movies, but this sequel is a bit of a disappointment. The story is very contrived, and the acting too exaggerated. Also, while it gives me a few chuckles, on the whole it's not that funny. In contrast, the first episode has a much more believable story line, is more clever and thoughtful, and much much funnier. Legally Blonde 1 is a ""must see"", but LB2 is forgettable. I enjoyed seeing Mary Lynn Rajskub though; I think she is more talented and attractive than people give her credit for."
1,Why?,I do not understand why this movie was made. It is terrible. I seriously regret asking for this DVD. I did really enjoy the first Legally Blonde because she eventually bettered herself and seemed to have matured and grown but in the second movie she is very annoying and seems to have been dropped on the head several times because she's so stupid. On the DVD extras (I did not manage to watch them all) they said they had tried to make her appear more mature but I think they need a dictionary as she appeared the furthest thing from a Harvard graduate that I have ever seen. I did not laugh once in the movie - it was painful to watch.
2,Another chance to hit your wallet,"Witherspoon is absolutely wonderful, so I watched the first ""Legally Blonde"" movie just because I enjoy her. It was mildly entertaining, however, this one had me turning off the tv after about ten minutes. Maybe it got better, but I'd really suggest renting it before buying it. Sometimes a sequel is just a waste of time and talent."
3,SO-SO ...SO not as good as the first one.,"Although Reese Witherspoon is captivating to watch, this movie lacked any real substance. At least in the last one she was in a believeable cause. It's cute, lots of fashion and fluff...but you find yourself wishing it was just over. And lots bad sex/gay jokes. The worst was the end..well I wont spoil it for you...but I totally did not get the big speech. I hope they do not stretch for a third, unless they get better writers. Watch it once...but not a keeper."
2,BORDERING ON ABSURDITY,"First off, I did enjoy the first LEGALLY BLONDE. I found it to be fun and somewhat originally. So when I discovered that a sequel was in the making I was naturally excited. My excitement, however, faded shortly after the movie started. While Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as Elle Woods in her crusade to pass a Congressional Bill prohibiting animal testing I found the unfolding of the plot a disappointment. This film has all the predictable characters (i.e. the supportive husband and jealous co-worker who aims to foul your plans) and outcomes. Despite these flaws, I was especially offended by the portrayal...dog sub-plot that had no importance to the plot itself. Overall, I was very disappointed in LEGALLY BLONDE 2."
2,Legally BAD,"ICK. I really wanted to like this movie. But the sad sorry truth is that i don't. the first one was great, it delivered fast, fun comedic jokes. this one not so much. it's going a bit far and deaperate when america needs entertainment at the expense of the sexual orientation of DOGS. as a film student, i also noticed freqeuent shaky camera shots and a weak story line. not to mention how fast everything goes in the movie that is's so hard to keep up. there are too many sub plots and paralell episodes, that i can't keep track of what is what and which is which."
2,Sorry,"I loved the first one, and it seemed from some reviews that this one was at least as good. No such luck. Basically, it was lame, lacking the charme, style, and well balanced humor that Legally Blonde had.As for Reese, I could eat her witherspoon, but she is not enough without help from a good script and good co-actors. (Who are those two rejects playing her best friends? They are not even pretty, which must be hard to find in Hollywood.)"
1,Sequelitis,"This movie disappoints. In the first movie, Elle had untapped potential. She moved beyond being an airhead. In this movie, she takes several steps back. Her naivete (or is it stupidity?) is beyond unbelievable. The rest, except for a few nice moments is pure drivel."
2,What Happened?,"I was so looking forward to this movie when it came out. Legally Blond was a fantastic, funny movie with witty dialog and a quirky cast.The only thing Legally Blond 2 got right is bringing back the original actors to play their characters.In the first Legally Blond, Elle is intelligent, if not a bit naive. She may come across as a little ditzy but she isn't, and it's apparent in many scenes. In Legally Blond 2 she is completely stupid. Like OMG Animal Rights for our gay dogs and stuff.This movie could have been amazing. The potential to make a movie with a ""girly"" but still ridiculously intelligent woman, was huge, but in the end this movie fell hard. I wouldn't recommend this movie under normal circumstances, but if you are having a dumb movie night and it's free, you might just try it to see what I mean."
3,Better than the original,"I find this one much better the first one. Here she has proven that she is no dumb blonde and takes on a cause-animal rights. Also it pokes fun at social issues. Like when Elle Woods find out that her dog Bruiser, is actually gay, and is in love with Representative Stan Marks's dog-Leslie. Representative Stan Marks find out that he own a male dog and not a female dog. That probably sent a lot of dog owners into therapy, wondering is their dog is gay, lesbian, or straight. Overall I enjoyed the movie. I just don't know if I would recommend the movie or not."
3,WOODS IN WASHINGHTON*3 AND A HALF STARS*,"This is the long anticippated sequel and its worth the wait. This tells of Elle Woods (Witherspoon) who finally gets her Harvard degree and is now planning her wedding. In the process she finds out that she did not invite her chihuaha's (Bruiser)mom. She finds out that she is a test animal (after a misunderstanding of VERSACE. This sequel tells of Woods trip to Washinghton and her trying to pass a bill of animal testing (Bruiser's bill).The plot which is ver simple has been made so humourous. With lies, gay dogs, snap cups, humour, sarcasm and more this movie is sure to impress. Not as good as the first but still passes with flying colours."
3,Silly sweet entertainment,"This is a silly sweet film which can provide some pure non-thinking entertainment but only if you leave your logic aside for a while. I guess Silly is the right word in this regard as this is a light, bubbly kind of word which implies stupid but no harm done.Reese Witherspoon is really sweet to watch, especially when she wears her pinkish outfits to Capitol Hill. I can't say much about the plot...all is so far-fetched that treating it seriously will only damage the pleasure. Cosmetics industry...dogs as lab animals...Elle Woods changing the Washington attitude (its not that this is not necessary) and everything working out in the end with a lot of kindness and smiles... and pink! I forgot. Sally Fields is really becoming as the villain."
1,Good but,It's a good brush cleanser but Don't pay more than 15$. It's overpriced here. Shop for this else where. You will find it for less than 15 $.
2,Not worth my time,"I own a lot of books on chess, and chess culture, such as Fox and James' The Complete Chess Addict. I had owned The Dragon Variation for many years before recently reading it, and it was not worth the time spent doing that much less hauling it back and forth across North America. It has no point, and the characters are not well written. If you have ever been to any USCF tournament, the tournament scenes will be nothing novel."
4,Few others compare,"There are very few options if you are looking for this truly ""in-line"" form factor. This is quality made. I haven't put it through a rigorous testing process, and it hasn't tripped yet, but I'm happy with the quality of the workmanship and the design. I did write an email to their tech support with some questions about the device tolerances, but I never rec'd a reply.UPDATE: It doesn't seem to hold much past 50-54A .. I'm disappointed that it trips at less than 60A. I have purchased a different 60A Type 1 which should arrive in a few days, hopefully the new one will hold to the full 60A rating."
1,Do not order from this person!,"I ordered a textbook for my daughter at college on August 15th. She was supposed to receive it by September 9th at the latest. As it got closer to the time it should arrive, I emailed the seller to see if they had shipped it yet. No response. I waited a few days to see if the book arrived and when it didnt, I emailed again. Again, no response. September 9th came and went and still no book. I tried one last email and still nothing. Her class had already started and she still needed the book. I finally got my money back through Amazon and I have yet to hear anything from the seller.Please do yourself a favor and find some other seller to order from to avoid going through what I went through!"
5,Favorite Sharpie,"This is definitely my favorite Sharpie product.They are similar to the ultra fine Sharpie, but I like the tip on this one a lot better. I think that it writes more smoothly than the ultra fine, but it's still a thin line so you can write really small.I have lots of these, and still have not had any die or fade.If these weren't permanent it would be my #1 go-to pen. Since it is permanent, it's my #2 go-to pen."
4,Extra Fine? Not The Ones I'm Used To...,"These are great marker pens, all said but I am used to the Extra Fine Sharpies that have the felt tip and for some reason that's what I was expecting. These work for what I got them for, and you can't beat the price!"
2,It works...for a day,"Came in pretty fast and it works exactly how it's supposed to. You can always trust a sharpie!!! Packaging was little cheap, but product is perfect.This is my update, these must be old, they are all dried up!!! This item sucks!"
2,All the wrong things... with a few exceptions.,"All the wrong thoughts to be bringing into this new stage in your life. The word ""confessions"" in the title should have clued me in to the fact that this book wasn't going to be about all the beautiful things happening to my partner. I don't disagree that other mother's really do have these thoughts, but its not a celebration book by any scope of the imagination. Do NOT give this book as gift to the ""other mother"" in your life."
3,Sobering essays on the emotional disconnect between expectations and realities,"Enlightening, but also sad--it doesn't shy away from the difficulties and regrets women may face in making choices and claiming and shaping roles for themselves that women have traditionally not made or held. Reading it made me decide I need to think hard and do much more reading and exploring the options and my feelings and capacities before I consider becoming a mother or an other-mother with a female partner."
2,"valiant, but misses the point","We gloss over the realities of life. This is just one more example.Having a child is essentially a narcissistic move. We don't bring a child into the world for the child, but for ourselves. If we thought about the child seriously, half the pregnancies would not happen. So yes, we have a certain sexual orientation and want to fulfill OUR desire to parent, so we get pregnant and embark in the adventure of becoming a mommy. Biological or not, you can be the best mother in the world, but you will NEVER be a father, and despite what current feminist psychology tells you, fathers are crucial.No one wants to talk about this because oh, how dare you infringe in my desire to procreate? But it is the truth, and books like this miss the mark."
5,Great Skills video,"This video was easy to watch, understand and apply the techniques and drills for the kids on our 12 year old team. The DVD was easy to access and get to the various drills easily! I recommend this to any dad, coach etc of younger players.."
1,Not worth the money!,"This video is a lot of fluff and special effects, but not much content. The 59 minute baseball practice video was far more helpful for coaching younger players."
1,Book full of incorrect information,"I must say that I'm genuinly supprised to see that anyone's willing to publish a book so full of mistakes. Not only a great number of caption texts of pictures are misleading and contain errors but there are may faulty statements in the actual text of this book. Most of the mistakes are obvious to anyone familiar with HK weapons (something the author clearly is not) but this leads to serious lack of credibility regarding the things the author writes about the history of the company. I will not be buying any more books by this author and I can not recommend this book to anyone. If you know HK weapons, this book has nothing to offer to you and if you don't then you are better of finding the information from better sources."
1,Lousy book,"I bought a hardbound edition of this book and did not read beforehand the reviews about this book. Well, this lousy book begs for a lousy review.I was surprised to see a stupid book about a very excellent firearm. Its incompleteness is extensive. This is basically a disinformation book (maybe counter-intelligence material). Pictures are drab and unclear. No wonder this book describes H&K as Armorers of the Free World. There is NONE around."
2,Not the best book on H&K firearms,"There are a lot of typos and misidentifed photographs in this book, which is all the more annoying as it could have been a better book than it is. Project 64 is still the pinnacle of books written exclusively about Heckler & Koch's line of firearms."
2,Recovery Bible,"Thought it was the larger one, I am sure I will use it sometime, bit needed it for a gift"
4,It is a blessing,This Bible is very good for those in recovery. It is best when used in a recovery group setting and there are leaders who help you work through the recovery steps and verses. The NLT translation is very easy to understand and this Bible will also help in other parts of your life.
5,My favorite Bible...,"This is my favorite Bible! I have given away at least 10 copies and I am on my 3rd personal copy! I bought the first one for my son who was in treatment at the time. Even tho I am not personally 'in recovery', I have found that the notes and devotions are helpful for anyone--after all, we are all recovering from SOMETHING...life just hurts sometimes!"
5,Love it!,Have bought over 30 of these bibles. We hand them out all over town. Have seen and expect to see alot of lifes changed.
5,Life Recovery Bible review,The insight and relationship between the 12-Steps and this Bible are fantastic. I relate to the bible much better with the help of the 12-Steps.
3,"London, England...Come Get Some","WWE Insurrextion 2002 took place in London, England on May 4, 2002. There was a double main event loaded with fierce action. In one main event, Triple H goes head to head with the Undertaker. The Game tries to exact revenge on the Dead Man after being cost the Undisputed WWE Title to Hollywood Hulk Hogan at Backlash. In the other main event, Stone Cold Steve Austin makes his final P.P.V. appearance over the pond as he takes on the Big Show. Ric Flair is the special enforcer for that match. In other action, Eddie Guerrero defends the Intercontinental Title in an incredible match against former champ, Rob Van Dam. ""The Next BIG Thing"" Brock Lesnar teams up with Shawn Stasiak to take on the Hardy Boyz. Steven Richards defends the Hardcore Title against Booker T. Spike Dudley gives William Regal a shot at the European Title. Bradshaw goes up against X-Pac. In a Diva's tag team match, Women's Champion-Jazz and Molly Holly take on Trish Stratus and Jacqueline."
2,iBad,"Well i do not know about others of you but this did NOT work out well for me. First of all, it only really holds about 220 songs, not 250. Second, it often deletes the songs and photos which take quite awhile to reload, and sometime won`t even do what I want. The battery also goes out quickly. Overall, i`d say the new iPod is a much better destination to go with."
2,Rowena's review,"Author's interpretation of the possible outcome of the effects of the missionary teaching on young Hawaiian Ali'i is filled with Aloha for the people and history of Hawaii. Unfortunately, the the portrayal of thought patterns and situations are NOT within the Hawaiian way of life, beliefs or thinking patterns. Her end analysis is acceptable and probable, her description of means is not."
1,Ustinov Movie is Much Better,After watching this Poirot film with David Suchet the only good thing I can say about it is the fact that it was filmed at the Burgh Island Hotel in Devon. The acting is dreadful ! Not even David Suchet with his gentlemanly manners can save this dud ! Get the 1982 DVD version with Peter Ustinov & Maggie Smith & Diana Rigg instead.
1,Bored under the sun,"There is just one word to say about this film: BORING!!!!!!!Forget it and watch the old version from 1981 with Peter Ustinov, Diana Rigg, Maggie Smith and James Mason - the best Agatha Christie-film-adaption!"
1,"Yes, this is really boring","I agree with rigg_vienna. This film is one of the worst of all Agatha Christie movies. The version of 1981 with Sir Peter Ustinov is MUCH better, and not to forget such great actors like Dame Diana Rigg, Dame Maggie Smith or James Mason. If you want ""Evil under the sun"", forget the new one and buy the classic one from 1981."
2,Not made for heavy items,"I am a student and bought this bag at the beginning of September. By December the stitching on one of the straps started coming out and one of the plastic pieces holding the strap snapped. I think this would be a great backpack for airport travel or lighter loads because of its great features. It was not able to handle 3 textbooks, a binder and a laptop."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this pack for my first year of graduate school. I was initially impressed with how light and comfortable it is, but was somewhat put off by the absurd number of compartments (however, if you like to have a seperate compartment for each thing you want to put in the pack, this is the one for you). Admittedly, I put this bag through a serious amount of use. At times I used it to carry my 15-inch Powerbook, adapter, iPod, numerous textbooks, folders, spare jacket, etc. I carried heavy loads in this pack on a regular basis. After two semesters of use I was disappointed to discover that one of the shoulder straps was ripping away from the top of the pack. This turns out to be unsurprising given how ""light"" the pack is overall. A close inspection reveals that little if any of the stitching is reinforced, and that the materials used are not of very high quality. However, if you don't carry heavy loads or abuse this pack very much, I imagine it will last longer than mine did."
2,Too Much Information!,"I bought this book expecting a few simple exercises and questionnaires that would help me identify and refine my personal design taste. What I got was a lengthy, in depth, and rather confusing series of tests put together in seeming random order. I can see how this book would be helpful for those willing to invest more than a few hours in exploring various design genres, but I would not recommend it to the amateur or casual decorator."
5,Designed by Me,"I have a shelf full of books on design but Ms. Love's is the first to take me inside myself. Most books are full of advise on color schemes and furniture styles and such but none that I'm familiar with challenge/help the reader turn often intuitive likes and dislikes into a strategy for creating a style of h/her own. On top of that, the book is fun -- and visually beautiful as well. Hats off to Ms. Love for a beautifully conceived book that combines intelligence with design savvy to help us novices find our own individual styles."
1,Difficult to use,"I have had this book for a few months now, so I have given it a fair try.But I still don't like it. It's difficult to use, to act on. It looked interesting, and I like the idea of learning more about my own tastes and why I like what I do. It's just that the book didn't fulfill its promise. In searching for help in this area, I came across The New Decorating Book, which has made it easier for me to understand my own tastes and also has taught me the design basics I need to decorate my own home. The book even has a quiz which helps people to understand their decorating personalities. My daughter's home ec class was using The New Decorating Book, which is how I found it. I also like Real Life Decorating, because that book gives me ideas and talks about understanding how my personality and lifestyle affect how I decorate my home."
1,A waste of money,"The book looked good and sounded interesting, so I bought it. Mistake. The idea of learning about and expressing your own taste is covered so much better in so many other decorating books. This is very hard to use, as an earlier reviewer said. And the tiny pictures do not help that situation at all. Again, there are many better books on the topic."
3,"Interesting, but not exceptional","This group could do without the synthesized rhythm. It intrudes too much and is distracting. Furthermore, it is evident that the percussion is canned."
3,"Like the game is sound,few adustments away from greatness",I like Seven Kingdomes 2 but think there are a few problems. 1 is that is you are the humons your population doesn't reproduce (you use your towns men to make soilders and spies) 2. is that in the game I had trouble getting past the second level. 3 is that I would have an army and then 1/2 would just become part of the other Kingdom and walk. I still like this game and with some minor improvments could be in my top 10. Seven Kingdoms is still worth your money.
1,The worst game ever,"When I bought Seven Kingdoms two I thought I would be buying a real time civiltion. This was not true. The game was very complicated. The main problem when your the humons is you run out of people. It's not like age of Empires, a better game where you create people for food (it's is like that for the monsters) You people revolet and you can't even really beat the second level. Also when your army just gets up and walks away due to the computers unfair spying skill. This is a horrible game"
3,Arts of the Belle Epoque Era,"Despite the title, this book focuses mainly on the art of Paris-the painters,sculptors,etc, the theaters and the people who created the masterpieces that are so priceless these days--with a special emphasis on Picasso and his ilk.A possible drawback of this book is that the chapters are broken up by years making it hard to obtain a fuller, richer picture of pre-WWI Paris as a whole, as opposed to the arts and brief mentions of journalistic or literary persons sharing a seat with the attitudes, modes and daily lives of the times.For a brief, yet somewhat satisfying sketch of this period and its art, this is a very good book. But for those searching for something with more substance, try ""Paris in the Nineties"" by Rudoff."
5,Best cheap headphones I've found,"As a person who goes through a lot of headphones I tend to buy the cheapest I can find but I really like having volume control on the wire so I dont have to dig out my ipod from my pocket. These Coby headphones are much better quality than the Koss ones I've bought in the past. The wire is strong enough to simply come unplugged instead of ripping in half when it gets caught on things or pulled on by the kids so far. I would definitely purchase these same headphones again when my current set eventually gets broke, lost or wears out. I don't care for the in-ear type but my sister seems to be enjoying the ones that came with this package. Well worth the price."
4,Great sound...,"These headphones have amazing sound on them - the base esp. is great. The only complaint I have - they tend to pull out of my computer a little too easily. Otherwise, like them and would buy again."
1,Horrible,Picked these up for 5 bucks. Sounded great - I love it for the first 24 hours. I went to use my iPod again and the right driver just stopped working - no sound at all. Went in the garbage. Not even worth returning.
5,Very good,"I have been using it for the last one year! The sound quality is pretty good and clear. It serves my purpose.Update (9/12/12): The headphone still going strong after almost 2 years of use!!! Worth every penny!!! Yes, I have had to put tapes around the chord at places where it seemed it could snap. But come on, look at the price!"
4,Great for quick starts,"This book is great if you're looking to get started quickly with MySQL. I was able to set up and create a database within hours after buying the book, with only minimal prior exposure to MySQL. Plus, it's a great quick reference for some of the standard MySQL commands that you may not need to use on a super-regular basis. The majority of the teaching is done through diagrams and examples, which allows the user to see what's supposed to happen, and have a gauge of how their performing. The text is just over half of the meat of the book, and really just fills in the blank spots that the diagrams leave out. I highly recommend this book for anyone just getting started with MySQL, but it as you get more proficient, you might want to pass it on to another MySQL newbie, as it may just gather dust on your bookshelf."
1,poor quality,"I was so disappointed when I received this Onegai toy. It doesn't look good like the picture displayed. The quality of the figure is bad, the color is fainted and peeled in some parts, the shape is not well made. It looks cheap."
1,Disappointment,I recently ordered and received this product and I would have to agree with the previous review. This figure is absolutely not the same quality as the picture. The glasses cannot be placed on the face and you can see the seams of the material it was made of. The color is not as brilliant as the photo. The picture shown here is a dramatization (which is also shown on the product box). Though I still like it and plan to keep it it would be really nice if they had an actual picture of the product rather than the items exagerated box picture. I doubt I'll buy a pvc figure again unless it's in person. Seller was awesome though :D Very fast delivery!
3,description,"Description: Blends yoga-inspired movements into an all-seated exercise program. Like classic yoga, it's designed to increase flexibility, reduce stress and improve balance. You'll certainly recognize traditional yoga poses like sun salutations, downward dog and warrior. However, they've all been carefully modified to be done while sitting down (e.g. holding a warrior's hand and arm position as your buttocks remain in the chair). Besides the yoga, Jody Stolove includes lots of innovative, non-yoga stretch movements like ""snow angels"" and ""spinal twists."" The program ends with short self-massage and guided relaxation segments. Calm, gentle cuing by a experienced seniors' workout instructor. 2002. (approx. 35 min.)."
4,Just downloaded episode 1,"If you are a Tremors fan, this short-lived TV series is for you. Great fun, with a couple of old faces. I downloaded episode one and it played fine on my computer, but it won't play on my Palm TX because of copy protection. Come on, guys--aren't we beyond that? I think the next greed-head who sticks copy protection on a purchased item should be slurped by a Graboid."
4,Very Entertaining,Michael Grossman's character stays true in this series. Plus the creatures are the same and I see the show as mindless entertainment.
2,Nwahulwana Is Missing!,"Amazingly the best song in the entire movie is not on the sound track. The song is called ""Nwahulwana"" but it is mispelled in the credits as ""Nwalhulwana"" (making finding anything out about it through web searches impossible as I discovered). It's performed by Wazimbo & Orchestra Marrabenta Star de Moambique.Thankfully a record company that distributes the original album posted a good mp3 of the song."
3,Soundtrack not complete.,"There is a great song at the end of the movie that sounds like it's by Van Morrison. Who is this, and why is it not on the soundtrack? Loved the movie by the way."
4,Great except for one song missing,"A lot of previouse reviewers have summed it up: This could be a great soundtrack if it had only included the best tune that happens to be in the movie. Wonder why they omitted it??otherwise, the soundtrack stays true to the movie..."
3,3 Stars for The Pledge,"This is a sub-par score. Not a phrase I would've expected myself to say considering it was a score composed by two of my favourites, Zimmer and Badelt. But there's nothing coherently interesting in this music. It was OK for a background listen, but if you're driving along in a car and want something to grab your attention, this album will probably put you to sleep. It's ambience music, through and through. The first track has some strange Horner like woodwinds in it, and Church Nightmare has an excellent suspense drive to it. But, other than a couple rather beautiful cues on the piano, there isn't much else here. Creepy strings that are usually attatched to thriller scores aren't heard, literally, until the last track. So basically, if you're a Zimmer/Badelt completist, you'll want this album. If you like well done ambience music, give it a shot. But a word of warning - I only paid 9 dollars for it, and it wasn't really worth a cent more.cheersKZ"
3,Whos is it anyway?,"Hans Zimmer is a Demigod in the art of scoring.he is a master in themes and african drumming, and percussion is the basis for action scoring.over the years, he's had some inspired disciples, and now the time for Klaus Badelt has come.and he's done his action scores, like ""Time Machine""and""Pirates of the Caribbean"".But this is nothing of the sort. If anything, it's ""The Thin Red Line""for a rednecks film.And Badelt does nothing more that keep it afloat. the theme is nice and distressfully quiet, but is it enough? Clearly not. How do you fill the rest of the running time?With noise? I guess his answear was... yes."
1,If I have to say it...,"This cd isn't good. This is ambience music yes, but i don't like it. I'm a fan of Hans Zimmer (like of John Williams, Danny Elfman, james Horner or Howard Shore who are best composers) but I don't know him in this soundtrack. I shouldn't buy it.."
3,"Good information, poorly presented","Without a doubt, Johnson has meticulously researched and documented the systems engineering and management processes as they arose in the Air Force, NASA, and other government research organizations. However, the book reads like a dry and dense textbook. While it may be that presenting this material any other way is difficult, I suspect that more attention to organization (of the text) and better editing would greatly improve the reading experience.That said, the content remains fascinating and Johnson must be applauded for packaging so much in such a small book. Definitely required reading for those in the area, but not worth the time of casual science or engineering enthusiasts accustomed to the (exceptional) writing of Simon Singh and the like."
4,"Good reading, don't need PHP or C#","This book was a quick read & well written.However, I don't need PHP or C#.How about VB?"
2,Not Happy,"Wed 10/03/2007 5:15 pm. I'm not sure who writes these positive reviews, but an early example in the book (""The Hidden Frame Technique"", starting on page 21) is obviously broken. The book shows ""HiddenFrameExample1.htm"" in an illustration but there is no such file in the ProAjax2ePHP.zip file downloaded from wrox. Judging by quotes on the internet probably from the first edition, I'd guess the actual file is probably GetCustomerData.php (?) but whether it is or not, that file has an obvious syntax error, missing paren in line 12 ""if (is_numeric($sID) {"". Of course if I were a php/ajax expert all this would be blindingly obvious; but I'm not, that's why I bought the book. I can't say I'm optimistic about the remainder of the text."
1,TERRIBLE,"I ordered this VHS tape because I am a huge fan of Triple H and Chyna. Ordered it 6 mos ago, havent received it yet!!"

2,Save Your Money,"It's Our Time, featuring wrestlers Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Chyna, definitely did not deliver. Beginning at around the time of his entry into Degeneration X, this video did a horrible job of analyzing Helmsley's earlier WWF career. The amount of wrestling in the video is also herendous, considering the fact that ""Triple H"" and Chyna are horrible wrestlers. The only plus about the video is the excessive amount of personal information spoken by Helmsley and Chyna themselves."
4,Excellent Book,"Good translation from the original Greek. ""Z"" is about a political assasination in Greece in 1966. Excellent read!"
2,"Great show, but DVDs suck","JAG is a great show, and even though I own the first 5 seasons on DVD, I still TiVo all the season 1 through 4 episodes on USA because that's the only way I can get the wide screen 16:1 pictures now routinely broadcast on cable reruns. Sadly, the only aspect ratio available on DVD for seasons 1 through 4, to this day, is the tiny 1.33:1 so-called ""full screen"" aspect ratio! This is unacceptable, especially since the wide screen pictures are regularly shown on cable channels. If I hadn't already bought them, I would hold out for wide screen versions of the first four seasons before spending a penny! Don't settle!Tom Etheridge"
5,"Unpretentious, unpredictable, beautiful and true...","This book is unpretentious at first. Then, you fall in love with the characters and finally you find out what it's all about: loss, forgiveness, redemption,what we want, what God wants, our plans, His plans and that still small voice that calls us to obedience. I cried at the end, not because the outcome was sad, but because Mibby made the right choice in spite of her desires. She heard the father's voice offering her respite and refreshment and she listened and obeyed. I loved it!!! I can't wait for the next book."
1,A Disappointment,"After reading the reviews of this book I was so looking forward to it. However, I couldn't get into the characters, except Louise, and found what I did read to be rather depressing. I only got as far as ""earring girl"" showing up at her house and buying Ky an ice cream.I am disappointed that I didn't enjoy what I read, as I had such high hopes."
4,Like a Watered Garden - Patti Hill,"It's hard to believe Like a Watered Garden is a first novel for Patti Hill. The author's writing is smooth and easy to read; her character's come alive. This first-time novel delves into the heartbreak of Mibby Garrett when her husband is killed in a bicycle accident. Lost without him, Mibby goes through the motions of living. But everywhere she turns she sees him--her young son, Kyle, looks just like him. At night, in bed, she cries into her pillow. When flowers arrive from her dead husband, Mibby plunges into a pit of despair. Only then does she accept the truth, she has to take charge of what is left of her life. Find out who and what gets Mibby back on course again.I couldn't put this book down.J. B. WilliamsAuthor, Chase Your Dreams"
3,not great but kept me entertained,I saw this movie when it premired on starz. That's right it's a starz original. It has it's bad parts (the cop) it's good parts (golf course and psycholigist) and slow parts but through it all it kept me entertained even though it was uneven. It is a pretty good plot that took some bad turns. Weber was funny though.
3,"Hey, this was pretty good","For a straight to video comedy with a box that spoofs Swingers,this movie was pretty funny... this movie had me laughing all the waythrough... even though the plot was thin, and the outcome pretty obvious... The movie had a lot of good drinking and party scenes, and it's heavy on drugs humor--so if that's not your thing, maybe you should pass it up. Fortunately for me, I like that kind of stuff. Nothing new, but not unbearable."
2,watchable.... MAYBE,I like alot of movies estevez is in and I also Like Steven Weber(especially from wings). On paper this looks like a solid pairing and youd think a movie about going out on the town to party would be pretty good. I was very dissapointed. This movie was made in 1998 and I just watched it Yesterday and now I know why? I am being generous with 2 stars.
2,Remember last night again?,"Steven Weber is one of my favorite funny man and if you ever seen him in Wings, you know his persona. He tries to cheer his buddy Dan (played by Emilio Estevez) up after his wife left him. They go into this night club and that is where the fun begins. He bring these two bar girls back to his room and they dance to the music by Blondie on top of the coffee table before falling off is very sexy and funny at the same time. All hell breaks loose after that and Dan tries to mend with his wife after a night of woo hooo fun.Not a very good movie and probably shouldn't be watch if your have a break up either."
1,"Wow, total wasit of time","L.A. lawyer, Dan (Estevez) goes out with a friend to spend the night. nothing new, not interesting. Total waste of time!."
5,"Very, very good","I received this a few weeks ago, and play it almost daily. Wichita Lineman in particular is extra tasty."
3,Amerzone...for the beginner,"A good game for the person who only wishes to move forward, Amerzone has a big price tag for not-so-big adventure. This game has a boring-to-annoying sound track, poor resolution and a fairly static environment. Good for the inexperienced or younger gamer, however--the puzzles aren't very puzzling and it's almost impossible to miss clues. 3D shots are excellent, easy to move around--storyline is interesting. If you found Myst/Rivan to be difficult, you'll love this one."
2,Amerzone.......Buyer Beware,"Amerzone is a good game for the young and/or inexperienced gamer. For anyone else the game is disappointingly simplistic and linear. While the story line is interesting the ""puzzles"" are not so puzzling. In fact the solutions are handed to you in such a matter of fact way that it's nearly impossible to miss any of them. If you can pick something up you can surely bet that it will have an immediate use in the next scene. Not too challenging. Lastly, the game itself did not play smoothly. I had several instances of broken and choppy graphics...especially as I walked through animated scenes....and the game crashed several times. Amerzone was/is a major disappointment. Recommeded only for begining gamers and older children."
2,A disappointing adventure,"While the graphics and visuals were extremely good the adventure part was totally lacking of any serious challenge. The story line has some excellent potential but the developers failed to capitalize or recognize this. What could have been an adventure to rival Myst or Riven, failed miserably. 'A' for graphics and visuals, 'A' for story line and 'F' for adventure and puzzles."
2,Nice graphics but a disappointing game,"I bought this game because of the PC Games Magazine quote on the box which stated ""better than Riven and Myst combined"". This game, although the graphics are good, does not even come close to offering the challenge, interest, and involvement of either of the previously mentioned games. The puzzles were so obvious that it was just a matter of pointing and clicking your way through a simple series of scenes. Disappointing."
3,"Good, but too short!","My children and I love playing adventure games together, and while we enjoyed playing Amerzone, it was over much too quickly. We were able to solve every puzzle on our own, and most were pretty obvious. I think that this would be a great game for a beginner, but it is just too easy for more advanced players. Also, I think that having the cursor change shapes when there was something to pick up or do was a bit too obvious. The graphics were beautiful, and the game is very visually appealing, but not the best that we have played. It was disappointing when it was over so soon."
1,Waste of time,"This game is a waste of your time and money. Unchallenging, illogical and a complete let-down. If you are expecting anything close to the success of Myst or Riven, do not bother."
3,The Little Mermaid By Goodtimes,"I purchased this movie for my 4yr. old daughter who is crazy about Mermaids;{she believes they're real.} She already had the popular Disney version and I felt the version based on Hans Christian Anderson was too harsh for a 4 yr.old. This little Mermaid movie however;is based on Hans Christian Anderson,but instead of a sad ending this has the happy ending children love. I rated this movie with 3 stars because I felt the ending was rushed and fell short. The contents of the movie was enjoyable.The little Mermaid Marries her Prince."
3,Blow dryer review,"Product was delivered as expected, although box in which product was located had already been opened. So far, product is functioning as expected. Order was easy, delivery was on time, and product is as advertised..good purchase, good seller."
4,Not Bad,"This blow dryer is so light weight, it surprised me when I pulled it out of the box. I wouldnt say there was an enormous difference in the time it takes to blow dry my hair, but I will admit it did improve the timing. The only complaint I have is the location of the on/off switch. Since its on the handle right where I hold it while blow drying, I tend to inadvertantly shut it off on a fairly regular basis. Oh yeah, the other complaint is the cost. I dont think its worth what is being charged."
2,Buyer beware!,"I bought this hairdryer December 21 from amazon. I filled out the registration paperwork and submitted it. I got an e-mail from T3 telling me that Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer and that I should return the item immediately and refute the charge with my credit card company. ""If the product is not purchased from an authorized dealer, they cannot guarantee that the product is authentic or warrant the product against defects, inadequate build quality and/or improper performance."" So for $160, I don't know if I'm getting a knock-off or what I'm getting--but whatever it is, it doesn't carry the 4-year warranty you would normally get.Amazon never allowed me to give seller feedback on this product.I liked that the hairdryer was quiet. Maybe it dried my hair a little faster? Maybe my hair was a little smoother?? I definitely didn't like the location of the switches on the handle.Bottom line--buyer beware!"
5,Expensive but worth it,"I was quite surprised that this product lived up to its hype. More then 3 times what I last paid for a hair dryer, I was skeptical at best.While still expensive in my opinion, it does dry hair faster, amount will depend on your hair. But the best thing is that it does not cause frizzlike most hair dryers. Your hair dries smooth. A new result for me anyway. So I am a believer."
5,Shadow Company: Left for Dead,"This game is great and will definitely run on most PCs. The strategy involved makes the game extremely enjoyable, along with the mercenary aspects involved. Once you complete the mission, salvaged arms can be sold to finance other missions. For an older game, this is one of my favorites. It plays like a Rainbow Six type game in an entire field look and strategy play like WarCraft II."
4,very good in general,This was good but some of the organ pieces are a little lose. The recording was as described and came early.
4,great but clones are less money,"This eyepiece gives great views in telescopes of all focal ratios because it incorporates additional lens elements that the 15 and 20mm linemates do not have. Think of it as a ""poor man's Nagler.""It is overpriced at $60 plus shipping. The identical eyepiece is available elsewhere (Agena and Owl) for under $40 with free shipping."
4,You can not go wrong with Expo,"Value for money, very good writing, no odor and the holder is quite good, plastic is not of the best quality but nevertheless a good buyLove the assortment of colors I have as a part of this pack"
4,Works,"I put this up in my room next to my whiteboard. The adhesive is small, so I had to reinforce it, but other than that the markers are new and the eraser is of decent quality. Cant beat it for the price!"
4,Good item,This is a good item if your dry-erase board doesn't come with a holder. It is very cheap plastic but good enough to hold these items.
4,Expo Dry Erase Markers,"Good product. Once you get the white board, you need the markers.I like the no odor ones the best."
3,"These do ok, but they don't seem to last long","i've been using these for a couple of weeks. At first they worked out great. Now the ones that I've used for a couple weeks aren't working so well. And whereas at first it was easy to erase the markings, now it's much harder. The ones that I've used for a couple of weeks are harder to write with and much, much harder to erase.I understand that felt markers don't last forever, but it's only been a couple weeks."
3,Office Supply,"Expo pens/markers. The white board choice and brand name for whiteboards.Keep away from children, these do not wipe from whitewalls."
3,Nice colors but cheap holder and eraser,"The markers are very nice and vibrant colors, but the holder (which is the primary reason I bought this set) is made out of very cheap plastic and cracked at the corners the moment I got it out of the box for the first time. The eraser is a little better, but still pretty light and seemingly non-durable... so far nothing happened to it yet, but I feel it'll probably tear soon after some use."
4,Great,"Very portable; I use these for my classes that I teach so I don't have to depend on what the hotels have, and I love it..."
4,Feedback,I made a mistake in placing my order. I wanted fine markers and didn't consider that the markers I ordered weren't that. I was surprised when they came but it was my fault. The kids use them on the dry erase board and are happy with them and that's the important thing. The response time was excellent. They arrived before Christmas!
4,Sturdy and Organized,Almost everything we need is in one place. If this came with some type of hanging brackets it would be ideal!!
3,Not one of the better SEAL books.......,"Having read my way through a good portion of books on the SEAL mission in Vietnam, I would have to say this one ranks pretty low. The author seems to be unfocused and the story floundering for a bit. Actually, to be honest, i never finished the book, a rare thing for me, but I just couldn't take it anymore. Don't worry about this one for your SEAL list."
3,This book was OK.,This book was OK. I think though there should have been a glossary or something in the back of the book for all the Vietnamese words he used! I couldn't keep them straight. As well as he himself kept jumping inbetween calling his commanding officer Mr. name and Dai Uy. It got confusing as to whether he was talking about the same guy. Enjoyed reading about all of the missions!
2,Ray J Sonnier,"I am far from bieng an expert on Seals, but this book in my opinion left a lots to be desired. I found it to be wandering a lots which made it very boring to me in comparison to the other books I have read by Nam Vets. By the way I was one of these Vets. We work alots in the Delta with Navy personel,and I found those people to be very good at their job.. Roadrunner6 out"
1,A very boring book,"I've been reading a lot of Vietnam first-hand reports and have found them all to be absolutly mesmerizing, but not this one.I only read about four chapters before i gave up. It was the most boring book i have read in a very long time. In those first four chapters the only thing approaching excitement was a trip into the jungle with an informant who said he knew where there the VC were. When they got off of the helicopter the author fell in a puddle up to his neck and they then found a lot of booby traps so the informant got cold feet so they went home. That's it. Not a shot fired.I'm going to try to return it."
3,Great Story - Mediocre Production Values,As usual I will not spend much time on the plot. The story line is one of PBS's best presentations of life in London from 1900 - 1930's. The story is about the below stairs staff who serve a very class conscious family called the Bellamys. The production values on this DVD set are about the same as in the first three series (which are none too good). The problem it seems is that there aren't any good masters from which to make the DVDs. I thank A & E for giving us this series. Every diehard USDS fan will want to add this DVD to their library. The VHS tapes will only continue to deteriorate. Let's hope that more recent Masterpiece Theatre series make it to DVD before the deterioration sets in. Upstairs Downstairs is worth a buy in spite of reproduction weaknesses.
5,The Best Season of Upstairs Downstairs So Far,"I am new to the world of Upstairs Downstairs, but this (the fourth) season is the best season I've watched so far. For those of you who are new to the world of Upstairs Downstairs, this series is a character driven drama which focuses on the disparate (but yet entwined) lives of the rich Bellamy's and their servants.Character growth, loss, tragedy and triumph are the themes of this season, as the characters are greatly affected by the trials of world war I. I highly recommend this for fans of this time period, or fans of BBC drama. I particularly liked the character arc involving Edward the footman, and the arc involving Hazel Bellamy. This is truly an excellent series, I am sorry that it was ended after the fifth season."
5,GREAT,"These are great strings, the coating is so much nicer on your fingers and they last so much longer then regular strings. great buy!"
5,Season 5,"In this season, a lot of more stuff happens. Emma deals with Anorexia, Paige has troubles with her sexuality with Alex. Spiner is allowed to come back to school and makes a new friend Darcy, Manning acting career is ruined and Peter does something bad to ruin her reputation, Jimmy tries to get back into basketball, Elie becomes the new drummer for downtown sasquatch and Later Elie gets closer to Jimmy, Mr. Simpson cheats on his wife Spike. Jay and Silent Bob make two more apperancesJ.T gets Liberty pregant and gets a job to support them, Later J.T even overdoses on prescription medicene. Jay and Alex gets starring credit, so does newcomer Peter and Mrs. Hatzilakos. Alex, Elie, Marco, Paige, Hazel and Craig graduate at the end of the season and Ashley returns at the end of the season"
5,My all-time favorite rice,"This is by far my favorite rice. It is so delicious even without anything on it! It can be hard to find at the store, so I hope Amazon keeps stocking it. It's very easy to cook perfectly and is delicious even if you overcook it a bit."
2,Misled,I wanted to learn how to open air preach. I didn't want to listen to a bunch of different people give reasons why we should.
5,This book is a MUST READ for migraineurs & their families,"My best friend suffers from migraines and I wanted to get her a book that might help.I chose Dr. Peterson's book because it was the one with the latest information. I read it to better understand what my friend is going through and learned that:a) A migraine it isn't just a headache and some migraines are menstrualb) There are all sorts of alternative treatments availablec) Headache sufferers had rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)d) There are lifestyle changes (such as avoiding foods) and therapy options (emotional issues can cause headaches) that can help headache sufferers.Finally a knowledgeable doctor who talks TO you, not down to you.I also found that Dr. Peterson practices in my state (Oregon) and, after doing a little detective work, found she is taking new patients!Best of all, my friend Marie LOVED the book as it helped her understand that she was not alone and that there was help out there."
2,Not very helpful if you've already done research on your own,"I've been under the care of a neurologist for 3 years because of severe menstrual migraines. I've also done extensive research online - about migraines and the drugs I've been prescribed. I did not feel like this book told me anything new. It also did not include the most up-to-date information about new drugs, including small doses of epilepsy medication for migraine sufferers. I DID find the ""migraine diary"" to be helpful. If you are unsure of the cause of your migraines, this tool could prove useful."
1,"Dull, repetitive...","I'll get to the point quickly and without repetition, unlike the book itself: Jon Katz makes some good (but often obvious) points; unfortunately, he feels it necessary to repeat them ad infinitum. What takes up 200 pages could have easily been summarised in a magazine article."
2,A refreshing breath of air and just about as nourishing.,"This is one of those book we on the left both love (because it lambasts the right) and hate (because it is equally violent to our own beliefs). I must admit it is thought provoking but the thoughts it provokes are not very deep. It's a nice 2-3 hour read and you can put it down occasionally to watch MTV or whatever and not miss a beat. If you must read this book with a serious mind I would highly recommend a chaser consisting of Carl Sagan's last work ""A Demon Haunted World"" lest you become too enamoured of the idea that popularity means anything more than the lowest common denominator"
2,For an alternate opinion...,"This book questions whether MTV, live television talk shows, the Internet, and computer games are corrupting America's values, hence disagreeing with those people who say these are negative influences. It takes an opposing stance to more than 3000 scholarly studies that have conclusively established such negative influences."
4,Tokyo,"This book is great for planning a trip to Tokyo. It shows all the attractions that are of interest and is a great companion for finding places to dine, stay, and shop. This guide has it all with high-quality photogrpahs and maps on every page. This is a must of a beginner traveller to Tokyo or anywhere in Japan."
3,Beautiful Book But Not So Practical,"This guide has beautiful color pictures and lots of information. Over 100 pages is just information about Japan. The guide part of the book is split into districts and talks about the different sights to see. The pictures and this organization is nice for planning a trip to Japan, or reading up on the history of Japan, however it's not as practical as a companion book to carry with you.First of all, it's heavy. You wouldn't want to carry a 1.5-pound book around. It doesn't have as many maps as some of the other guides do and the organization can be a little confusing if you want to look up info on just one place. The major problem with this guide is its complete lack of Japanese characters. It doesn't write hotel names, restaurant names, or anything in Japanese characters for you. If you want a book to carry around on your travels I would recommend Lonely Planet Tokyo instead."
4,4.5 stars hot mixtape,"You Got Black ryming over these hot beats....it doesn't make any sense....This is good if u have a party 4get that he sounds like BIG because BIG is gonna be in our hearts 4ever but just look at it like I look at it he is keeping the BIG memories going..hell SWV isnt still singing but if a group sounds like them and has the same style is them I am not gonna get mad that sh.t is childish...... and I dont care who dont like it because I can like Black take up 4 myself, but anyway check it out this is hot!!!!!"
5,Sometimes CD Single (Import),I own this single and thought I would give you some info. on it.1. Sometimes (radio edit)- a shorter version of this great single you can't tell the difference.2. Sometimes (soul solution remix)- a upbeat but a little boring remix of the song.3. I'm So Curious (non-album track)- this is a catchy little song that I heard that was written by Britney.
4,Sometimes CD Single,"This is a very nice single, and has 3 great songs on it. Here are my reviews of the tracks on this single.1. Sometimes - This is a very nice, mellow, catchy song. Sing-a-long, fun lyrics.2. Sometimes (Remix) - This is a very calm but funkier version of Sometimes. Isn't as good as the original, but still nice.3. So Curious - This is a track Britney wrote herself. It's very catchy, and since it isn't included on the album it's worth buying the single for."
5,This song ROCKS!,I LOVE this song! It ROCKS! If you like Britney Spears then you should get this single!
1,Is he insane??,"Patterson claims in this text that claims of racism in America are overinflated and that African Americans are doing quite well. While this Harvard sociologist may be doing quite well he has forgotten about the ""masses"". Patterson argues not only for integration and assimilation, but miscegenation. Is this his idea of ""if you can't beat them become them""?"
5,Excellent Introduction to the Subject!!!!,This has to be one of the best texts on phonetics I've ever encountered. Dr. Johnson takes some very difficult concepts in accoustic theory and makes them accessible to the beginning student.
2,"Good, But The Same","I enjoyed this tape but was disappointed when I discovered thatit was the same as the video tape entitled Rodeo Bloopers. I like alittle variety and I expected to see something different on each tape, not the same exact film."
1,awful,This album... It is terrible. DO NOT BUY!! This is simply not worth the CD it was printed on. Bad covers. It's not even as if the other bands are trying to put their spin on the music.. They're just trying to rip off Steve Perry and failing.
2,Hack job of covering Journey,Yikes! I expected better than this.For the most part feels second rate. The only vocalist who really impressed me here is Kelly Hansen from Hurricane/Foreigner. He has the range/style to do the songs justice. I can't even get through some of these versions. I'll be picking up Kevin Chalfont's (The Storm/Two Fires) tribute to Journey.
1,Save your money...,"Don't even think about buying this CD, especially if you own Journey's Greatest Hits. No one compares to Steve Perry's vocals, especially on Separate Ways and Wheel in the Sky. Tommy Shaw and Kip Winger did OK on their songs, that's why I gave the album 1 star. Otherwise I was diappointed with the remaining assembled talent. I'm still ticked off that I wasted good money on this attempt of a tribute to a great band. They deserve better."
1,Leave the journey songs to be sung by the Steve's,"Its nice that folks want to do a tribute to Journey but this cd is bad. Mickey Thomas from Starship did ok on his song but being a Journey fan since 1980, you just can't top Steve Perry or Steve Augeri (Journey's current frontman). The vocals and even the music on this cd was lame. If you want to listen to Journey songs buy Journey's music with Steve P or Steve A"
2,Can't recommend this cable,"I recently purchased this 100ft cable and installed it to connect a modem with a Satellite DVR. The wire is very slight and the protective cover was easily damaged. Also it pinched easily and was impossible to push straight through a drilled hole in the wall. I had to put it in a rod first and then push the rod through the wall to get the wire through. It was a big pain to get done. I had given up trying to get it through the drilled hole in the wall when I came up with the plan to put it in a curtain rod, which was the only way it would have worked. Trust me: you get what you paid for! This is cheap stuff in every sense of the word!In the end it did connect the modem and the DVR. So I admit it worked, but I wish I had paid a little more and gotten the heavier wire, which would have made the installation much easier and would likely last longer."
3,Color is not white,"If you are using this to match trim in your house, please note the color is NOT WHITE. Although it is close, the color is more of a light grey. Normally I'm very picky about this sort of thing, but considering the fact that this is a rental, I'm avoiding returning to find one that is actually white.So, in short, yes it works it's 100 feet, but it's not white, not even off white, but grey."
5,Great Ethernet Cable,"I bought this 100' Cat 5e cable to run through my attic in order to allow video streaming on my Blu-Ray player. The cable seems high quality and had all of the markings indicating that it was true Cat 5e. The connectors also seemed to be high quality and were easy to plug in and unplug. The cable jacket seemed a bit softer than some others I've seen, but it made the cable more flexible. Testing revealed that the cable worked fine and my download speeds were perfect. I'd say it would be hard to beat for the money!"
5,Great for the price,As a consumer you should never ignore the advice of others as I did. It nearly cost me. As stated it's NOT a heavy duty cord it's kinda fragile so I had a hard time trying to fish it through the walls. I was unsuccessful in doing so. I then clamped it along the base of the floor and it didn't work the first time because I pinched the cord to tight. Once I loosened the claps it work perfectly. This is a good cord and the lengh is very long. Just handle it with care.
2,not twisted pair cable,"works fine for my use, but this is not twisted pair cable as i assumed a ""Cat5e"" cable would be. feels cheep and flimsy without being twisted."
3,"good price, but thin coating","Good price, but cable coating is too thin, too easy to tear.Great customer service, they sent me a new cable for free."
2,Poorly protected,"The transmission across this cable has been decent so far, though I'm not sure how long it will last. The sheathing is flimsy and loose. I can pinch and roll it around the internal wires. In addition, the sheathing has ripped from the connector. I estimate that it would take nothing more than a door closing on it to cleft this cable in twain."
4,"Solid cable, hard to handle out of packaging","This product is as described. Fairly sturdy, well build. I didn't have any issues with the connectors. It is, however, wound so tight in the packaging it is nearly impossible to deal with. Once you try to stretch it out, say to run it through a ceiling, it wraps around on top of itself so thoroughly it takes two people to pull it apart. I don't really know of a better way of packaging this as it is 100ft, but I've never had a cable that was as difficult to install as this."
3,"It works as described, but...","YES, it works as described and the price is about the lowest I found. In use today, still working, but... It has a cheap look and feel. Doesn't seem as hefty or durable as most cables I've used. In the end, it works, and you save money."
3,A well-researched treatise on an important footnote,"Mr. Livingston's research is excellent, but the writing and somewhat sloppy copy editing detract from what could have been--should have been--a moving and important story about one of the great tragedies of the Civil War. I recommend for any serious Civil War enthusiast who can add his own experience to complete the greater canvas, but the casual reader might be confused as to the movement of the action and the place of the various characters.David Foster History Editor Augusta MagazineAugusta, GA"
4,Mauersberger good as always,"Rudolf Mauersberger always does well with Heinrich Schütz, at least if you listen to it from a perspective of Lutheran worship. Those who call for more ""Weihnachtsmusic"" would do well to research the seasons of the liturgical church more closely. A substantial part of the CD is devoted to Advent music (the 4 weeks before Christmas emphasizing the preparation of our hearts for the Savior). The Advent section also has 2 settings of the Magnificat (often associated with Christmas), one in Latin and one in German. The two things I would want Berlin Classics to do is less duplication as well as having the English translation (which would enable me to recommend it to my friends who do not understand German)."
2,Better modern recordings available,"Mauersberger (d. 1971) was a great advocate of Schutz' music and it is interesting to listen to this pre-authentic performance style to compare with the more recent Cordes (CPO) and Hennig (EMI) versions of Schutz Opus 11 - both of which have the advantage of digital sound, as well as completeness (2CD). The title ""weihnachtliche"" on the CD is a bit of a marketing ploy, although at least ""Ein Kind ist uns geboren"" has a Christmas theme. If you want Christmas music pick up the Parrott, Bernius or Summerly versions of Schutz' Christmas Story."
5,JUST TOO CUTE!!!,"This baby book is wonderful!!! Even has pages to fill out before the baby's born such as: first sonogram,cravings when pregnant,etc.... I found that real exciting!! I highly recommend this book,not only because Suzy's Zoo is CUTE,but because it's FUN!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed in this work. It was boring, and quite frankly was filled with errors of logic. The attempts to make similarities with Rabbinic Jewish doctrines seemed forced. I think a more honest approach would have been better."
3,Jewish objections are founded in truth not error,"what really gets me is gentitles spreading ""christianitty"" while celebrating pagan customs like halloween,christmas,thanksgiving,and easter. another thing how can you answer jewish objections to jesus when the masheeakh's name was never jesus in the first place. dan brown won't tell you about replacement theology which is anti-jewish. dan brown won't tell you about how christians believe the torah to be done away with which is a another lie. he also won't tell you about how christians believe the dietary commandments of the bible are done away with which also is another lie. i could write too many words on the lies of gentile christianity. Jewish objections are founded in truth and not in error. we jews know who we worship, christians however do not. i give dan brown three stars"
4,works great!,"It works great! It has been 2 days since it replaced the old one. I was worried about the motor noise because a review complained it. Fortunately the one delivered to me has almost no noise from motor except blower fan sound which is natural. Yet, it would be perfect if the patch(gasket) of glassfiber was included. My furnace needs new one because it is very old and easily torn into pieces when disassembled. That is why graded 4 of 5. The inducer itself is great! And under a hundred dollar!"
5,Great deal and easy to replace,"I was pleasantly surprised when I went to replace my old draft inducer Fasco makes it extremely easy, having the same electrical connectors and grounding wire ready to install. Replacing the old draft inducer was as easy unbolting the old and bolting in the new one the old gasket was still in great shape so i was able to reuse it. The fan noise is minimal and is hardly noticeable compared to the stage two fan over all I am extremely happy with my purchase."
2,"noisy, unbalanced fan",Sent the first one back because the fan was so off balance that it sounded like a helicopter landing in my livingroom. Second one was better but still noisy. Spend the extra $ and get the oem model.
2,A little misleading,"The full title is ""Bolshevism and the Russian Revolution: A Debate."" However, as this is a publication of the American Socialist Party, there isn't much debate in it. While there are minor points that the various writers disagree on, none of them bring up anything unique. This magazine-type publication is only 68 pages long, and only 4 of those were written by Lenin. $9 seems way too much to pay for so little."
3,Sharpe's Ransom is a cut above,"To begin, this is definately for Sharpe fans only. But, for those, it is a must have. I gave it three out of five stars, but have done so conditionally.Sharpe's Christmas consists of two short stories originally published in the Daily Mail. The first story, Sharpe's Christmas, I could only give two stars. It is Sharpe warmed over.The second story, Sharpe's Ransom, is well worth the price of admission. I would give it four maybe even five stars. Having read all the books, I found it is much more enjoyable visiting with the retired major on the farm than following him back to Spain.P.S. - let's see Sean Bean in Sharpe's Devil"
4,UNEXPECTED,"This was presented as a book, and I assumed it was a novel. It turned out to be the reprint of a short story, a fact not revealed in the original advertisement of this story."
1,Cornwell in general,"I'm sorry but I think Cornwell's novels became far too formulaic a long, long time ago...the endlessly recurring, almost nausiating cliches and historical inaccuracies-from the French calling the English ""God damns""?? The Grande Armee term was ""Les Goddans"" and meant in no way more respectfully than for example the Austrians ""Les Kaiserlicks"" or any of their other sundry enemies, to the repeated slaughter of the enemy with practically no loss to our protagonists...I think Sharpe and Cornwell reached a peak in the early days of Sharpe's Eagle/Gold/Enemy etc-before our hero exchanged the rookery of St Giles, London, for the Yorkshire of Sean Bean and the world of cheap TV mini-series and of course became the template for Starbuck and Thomas of Hookton...Anyone interested in a good Bernard Cornwell book should read Redcoat, which has an original plot-line, good characterisation and a thoroughly believable cast..."
4,Cute story,"I'm a huge fan of the Sharpe's series, so this is a cute little story not only for the holiday but for all year long."
4,Sharpe's Christmas,"As is ""Sharpe's Skirmish"" this too is a chapter sized publication. Well written and interesting and should be included in everyones Sharpe series library."
2,"Easy to read, but not as detailed as one would like.","As a layman, the book is easy to read and offers some nice historical facts. However, the one page synopses of various styles seem to be too brief to offer any kind of detailed analysis of what a particular style has to offer. The book probably should have been longer. In addition, we learn much more about what Baker does not like rather than what he likes. The references to classical architecture, including the diagrams, lack clarity. The book may be a good starting point to learn about American residential architecture, but it is by no means a Bible."
1,Not nearly as good as her first memoir,I was surprised that this memoir was not nearly as good as her first memoir.
5,"""Hungry for the World"" leaves me hungry for more.","When Kim's first book ""In the Wilderness"" came out, I was mesmerized by the poetic language and the compelling story of her youth. ""Hungry for the World"" continues where Kim's first book left off, with an equal or greater power. I have a great respect for Kim, who can share the dark periods of her life with others and do so with such clairty and beauty that she can shatter that darkness with the light in her heart. I have seen Kim read in person, and her speaking voice and her voice on the page are one in the same: spellbinding and beautiful. This is a body of work that will be remembered and respected for a long, long time."
1,You really drive me crazy,This CD Rewview is just a quick note to say that this CD is very very bad. DO NOT buy!!!
5,The Journey is the Goal - Every day is your life,"Though some may off-handedly categorize this book as a Martha Stewart wannabe, it is very different. Instead of relying on perfectionism that requires a paid staff and a frantic pace to manufacture items for other people to admire, it focuses on making each day beautiful in small ways, which add up to the rituals and reality of how we live our day-to-day life. It leads the reader through deciding what is important in his/her life, where they spend their time, and what little things could be made wonderful. I had read this book and incorporated many of the ideas, when my husband was diagnosed with cancer, and was suddenly housebound. The idea of making his small world more pleasant and interesting and workable became much more important, and this book helped me examine and learn how to do that. Recommended for those people who need some ideas on reducing stress, or who want their homes to be havens of peace."
4,I want to loathe it but I can't.,"I love nothing better than to scorn this type of book--the ""the-whole-world-will-be-better-if-you-just-have-a-bubble-bath"" world of Martha Stewart and Alexandra Stoddard. However, I have to confess, when I'm having a bad day, it IS soothing to read through this book and just believe that, were I to have a lemon squeezer placed just so on my kitchen counter with fresh lemons next to it, all would be right with the world. I can dream, can't I?"
2,Nothing on Truck Campers,"The cover lists ""Truck Campers"" under the description: ""most complete technical manual ever"". I found specific info on motorhomes, trailers, fifth wheels, but beside the term ""truck campers"" on the cover, not a mention, even in the section on jacks. My copy is a 1998 edition. Maybe this omission has been addressed in newer editions."
5,A Great Reference...especially for the New RV faced with repairs or improvements.,"This is a very honest, worthy book for a new trailer or RV owner. The details and information are well organized, with illustrations to help solve most of the issues or repairs encountered. I recommend this book, and it might be a good buy as a used book."
5,Rigger Style Pants at a great price!,These were a pretty good deal versus the department store price. The quality is excellent and they are great at maintaining that wrinkle-free look right out of the dryer.
3,Book Review,I have known the author for many years so I was compelled to write a review. Since I am mentioned in the book it brought back many memories about Danny that I had forgotten all about. A good read
5,DiAngelo's Search,Gripping story of a former preacher who realizes his own hypocrisy. Search for significance is common to every person in some way or another. DiAngelo's story is inspiring and expertly crafted.
5,Kuryakyn Battery Gauge,"After experiencing catastrophic stator-rectifier failure on a long motorcycle ride, I installed a Kuryakyn battery gauge. The gauge displays a series of LED lights with red on the left, then orange to the middle and green from center to right. As long as you have green lights flickering, you know the charging system is working. In the event of system failure, you get red/orange warning lights, and instead of a dead battery and motorcycle beside the road, you have some time to remove headlight fuse and shut off any other non-essiential electrical accessories, and hopefully have enough battery left to get home or to help. Pros: This thing is tiny, so you can mount it about anywhere, bright easy to see day or night. You can order it in chrome or black finish. Connect to any source that is normally on when riding, like tail light circuit. Negatives: In my opinion, the red light on the left is almost distractingly bright (of course you can tape over it)."
1,Inaccurate,"I had problems with battery going dead so I bought this gauge to watch my electical system. It is just plain inaccurate. I gave it one star because it doesn't do it's basic function. I compared with a Fluke meter that I know is accurate and there is 2 volt difference. I called Kuryakyn and they said don't worry about the numbers, only the LEDs. However, there explanation of the LED scale doesn't match the 8 - 16 Volt scale."
4,"Very nice, compact and easy to read","Good product, easy to install. Only negative is the red and yellow and green LED's are always illuminated. At night they are a little distracting. Wish only the LED corresponding to the voltage would illuminate."
3,Not what you might think...,"I read about these pens in an article and was fascinated because I learned that President Lyndon Johnson sought them out for any bills he would sign into law. Wow, what a recommendation! I went out of my way to find one at a pen shop in NYC and was immediately surprised (read, disappointed) by the chubby, make that fat, point / tip. Yes, if I was the President and wanted my signature to be bold (LBJ was, if anything BOLD) this would be my pen. But it's not a pen for writing notes, letters, jotting in your planner. No way Jose'... This pen's point is just too broad for that. Signing autographs - perfect. Writing regular stuff - not so much."
3,Grey pen,"I thought it would be more like an ink pen, but is more like a marker. The size is also larger than I expected."
4,Good times.,"Had some laughs, this album grew on me. It's good. There's a rocking little song in Russian, some gypsy type music, and a hillarious 3 minute long '80s hair rock style goodbye. Remember that clip on 'The man Show' where Adam Carolla does a joke-commercial for classic rock, where every song is about a ""whiskey-drinkin'-devil woman-cajun-rambler-gypsy queen"" and was a ""Ten on the ROCKTER scale'? You do? This is an 8."
1,Don't bother,"I'm sorry I bought this album... Huge fan of the contributors I was hoping for something really great. I guess I had my hopes too high. 3 or 4 tracks are nothing but noise and sampled talking, it seems like they didn't put any thought into arrangements or song writing for most of the album. I've not heard any of the other volumes of the series, just picked 7&8 on a whim. The only positive thing I have to say about this is the alternate version of ""Hanging Tree"" was cool."
1,Food Tastes like Lighter Fluid,My mom bought this garbage for a Thanksgiving.1. This stuff did not light with a match. I had to use a Chimey lighter with newspaper to get it to light.2. The entire 25lb Turkey and Stuffing tastes like lighter fluid.Simply awful. I am throwing the left over bag of charcoals in the garbage. They are completely useless.
2,Pretty from the front,"These look so beautiful in the picture, but they are not that good! They don't dangle freely, so I don't like that. The back is flat, so I don't like that much either. I think the price is too high for these."
2,Could be nicer for the price,"I like these earrings BUT.....for the price, should have included the little plastic guards to prevent them from pulling out of your ears. Plus not as well made as I would have expected. Still..they are silver and the design is nice."
5,"Great Illustrations, Wonderful Message","The eye-catching colors and characters on the cover of this book drew me into it - and I am so glad. This book is a delight for the eyes and for the heart. It seems everyone, particularly children finding their way in this great big world, can relate to Nancy, who discovers through kindness to another that she is certainly NOT a ""nobody"" but a likable ""somebody"". Through dynamite illustrations and clever, but never cutesy rhyme, this book has it all. I wish it would become a series."
5,Good buy,"We bought 2 of these for our oldest grandchildren and they work great. All in all, a good purchase."
4,An enjoyable page-turner ...,"My first Jenny Siler, & I finished it in no time. I found this book to be easy, and at the same time, engrossing reading. I plan to read her other books. RECOMMENDED."
4,Soft Speaker Pillow speaker,This speaker is very soft and comfortable to sleep with. Do not wake up with a headache.Would recommend this item
1,Uncomfortable,"Had to remove the so called pillow soft covering and just place speaker under pillow, but volume is a problem under my foam pillows. My ears hurt from pressing my head so hard to pillow in one spot to try to hear it. Hard to fall asleep listening to music when my mind is working hard to maintain ear position!"
3,Volume is not Loud enough....,The volume control is a little to low.I cannot hear it under my pillow.I have to use it next to my ear.
1,Useless,"I had hoped for something more comfortable than sleeping with an earbud, but this was not the answer. It is hard palstic with a cushion around it. Place it directly under your ear (or under the top layer of the pillow case) and it feels like sleeping on a rock. Place it under the pillow and it's not audible. At high levels it sent out an amazingly annoying high pitched whine. At moderate levels there was so much static I could not hear the dialogue. I was really unimpressed. My strong suggestion is keep looking."
3,Good but not great,"A good speaker for use INSIDE a pillow case. I have used it successfully each night for over a year. BUT you cannot use it with the enclosed soft pillow without increasing the volume greatly (and it it still almost too soft to hear). It is also very uncomfortable to lay on with the pillow on. If you need to keep it soft enough and close enough to your ear so that you don't disturb someone else, plan on taking the cover off. Don't sleep directly on it--the holes in the metal cover will catch your hair during the night and pull! I would probably buy this again for the sound but not for the style."
5,Nice Product,"Great product. I plug it into my iPod and tuck it under my pillow. It lets me listen to a playlist, or audio book, and the iPod shuts off afterwards (when I'm asleep) It allows me listen without disturbing anyone else!Bought a few as gifts too!(Now lets hope the subliminal weight loss messages work!);-)"
3,For stereo units - good luck on plugging it in to some non-stereo radios though,"No sound comes through (at least on my radio) if the radio is mono and not stereo. So I read an adapter plug could be used - bought one - but in a Radio Shack mono speaker portable radio, the adapter plug keeps coming out of the hole! Tried tape - still comes out. It works fine to link into stereo speakers though - might try another adapter plug sometime for the mono radio. Nice soft sound, just what you'd want if you're linking to a stereo speaker....."
2,Pillow Speaker,"Product was inexpensive and may work if not in under a pillow, but you cannot hear it if it is embedded. Others had commented on the inability to hear it, I guess I should have listened closer. No Pun Intended."
1,Like sleeping on a rock,I bought two of these for both my wife and I. It's as hard as a rock and neither one of us could stand it for more than a minute or two. If you put this thing directly under your ear the pressure quickly becomes painful. Experimenting with different pillows didn't help. I sent them back and got a refund.
4,Useful bedtime accessory,"I have purchased several of these. They are very good for listening to radio, music, etc. late at night so as not to disturb others. My only issue is that the wire is somewhat flimsy. It could be a slightly heavier guage."
2,"Great concept, but junk","I am now on the fourth one in about three years. When it works, it is great, but after several months the connection where the cable and plug join goes bad. At first the sound cuts in and out as you move the cable around, but eventually the internal connection goes bad and the unit stops working entirely. I keep buying them, because they work great for several months, but I am getting tired of spending $20 every eight to twelve months. Perhaps they can come up with a better cable system which is a lot more durable."
2,Gift did not meet expectations,"I gave the C. Crane pillow speaker as a Christmas gift to a family member upon his request. However, when he tried to use it, he said the sound quality was so poor, he could not use it and would have to purchase another brand of pillow speaker."
2,"Great start, poor finish.","Loved this pillow speaker for a couple years up to now. It has superior sound quality, even through a pillow, but I have no choice but to question the quality of the cord and connection to the speaker itself. My cord has recently ""snapped"" from the base of the speaker, leaving it worthless. It has not been subjected to anything other than general use and good care, so it's ultimately a disappointment."
1,I agree with Mike,Good product in terms of initial sound but the cord goes bad fast and there isn't any way to take the thing apart to fix a likely loose connection.
4,I'm ordering another one!,We live in a small appartment and like different TV shows and this speaker is high quality and the sound is great. I'm ordering a second one to replace a different kind that stopped working.
2,Speaker-Wire Connection,"I too was disappointed in the wire breaking at the speaker connection. It is less than a year old. I had another from Radio Shack and it succumbed to similar fate. The connection has a joint softening transition, but it is still too stiff and you get severe bending in the wire at the transition. It breaks at the transition with no convenient repair possible. I will get another and try to jury rig a softer transition with Shoe Goo."
3,No volume control.,The speaker works well except it has no volume control. I like to turn the sound down when commercials come on which happens alot when you listen to talk radio.
1,Not recommended,"Can not push all the way into audio jack on radio (tried on 2 different radios). Has to sit just right to hear sound, which is then too low. No on/off switch, so I need to pull it out of radio when I want to hear the radio speaker, which makes having to seed it just right each time even more of a pain. Waste of money. Threw it out."
3,Misleading picture,"When I bought it, there were two different pictures of the speaker pillow. I was hoping for the the larger, hand-sized one, but got the smaller palm sized pillow. The smaller one is harder to use than the hand sized one I used to have."
1,"Thick, hard and uncomfortable",This pillow speaker is not very loud and is very uncomfortable. I tried putting it under my pillow with the volume turned up full and couldn't hear it with my ear on the pillow. I tried to create an indent in my pillow to make it comfortable with the pillow speaker on the pillow but that didn't work either. With the weight of my head on the pillow speaker it was more than just uncomfortable it was a little painful. It is to thick and not a very good design. I would research a little and get one with a two speaker design that goes under your pillow but is loud enough to hear like the Pillowsonic Stereo Pillow Speaker.
3,works as advertised,"it is worth the price paid for it. Nothing extra special to get a higher rating, nothing wrong to get a lower rating."
3,Barely audible - too quiet,"I have to lay this thing alongside my ear (on TOP of my pillow) in order to hear the thing. I'm not old and not hard of hearing, either.Under the pillow, I have to work very hard at locating the speaker in alignment with an ear pressed into the pillow to hear it at all.Perhaps this is the nature of the beast. So, the solution is to somehow get an inline amplifier/powered speaker solution to amp it up a bit."
3,good product but poorly made,"I believe this is the fourth time I have purchased this product. It has a life of about two years or less because weres separate inside the speaker which cannot be reconnected according to the manufacturer. While it works it is the best of what is available to me knowledge,"
1,Cheap construction,The cord connecting to the earphone jack became defective within a couple weeks. Otherwise the product was very satisfactory. Returning item.
1,Defective,"Did not work straight from the box. Too much trouble to pack and return, so I will just EAT the cost. Not happy."
1,Help?,It only works in my big stereo in the living room. For some reason it doesn't work in any of my other radios. Am I doing something wrong? What more is there? You plug it in and it is supposed to make noise - right? I can't use it unless I want to sleep in the living room.
3,"Reasonable quality, a little loud UPDATE - DIDN'T LAST LONG","This clock is just what you'd expect. The numerals are easy to read, the hands are visible and move smoothly. It's easy to set the time. The workmanship is okay -- nothing special, but not a cheapy piece of junk.The one thing that surprised me is that it ticks audibly. It's very noticeable in a small room.***************UPDATE*******************This clock started slowing way down about 4 months after purchase. I put in fresh batteries, and it still ran slow. After about a month, one night the minute hand started racing around the clock. I removed the battery and installed another fresh battery. And it's back to running slow.Sigh. Time for another new clock."
1,Doesn't keep time,"The clock stops advancing the time frequently, the second hand will quiver, but not advance from time to time. shaking the clock will get it going again, and sometimes it starts on its own... But the result is it looses time, anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 hours per day.It never kept good time ever."
5,Matthau Rules!!,This is a great 50's movie starring and directed by Walter Matthau as a bank robber falling in love with a librarian who tries to set him straight!!
3,not your parents' Esquivel,"Neat idea, nice execution, but not much fun to listen to. I really love Esquivel, but this LP is just too ZOUNDS! WHAT SOUNDS! and MUSIC FROM A SURPLUS STORE for me. When I think Esquivel, I think orchestra leader and amazing arranger. On this LP the RCA sound effects department is the real star. There is some nice playing and arranging (Esquivel could do Hawaii as good as Baxter & Denny) but for my money it compares to Michael Jordan trying his hand at a baseball career. No wonder RCA balked at this idea back in 1962 'cause it just wasn't good old Juan. Get it if you are an Esquivel completist or if you like your music dominated by sound effects."
2,Not what I was expecting for Bio,"On the Bio Channel on TV, you're given a full biography about the person/people they're telling you about. For some reason this DVD focuses around The Tony Danza Show and all the promotions that went into getting it on TV. Being a huge Who's the Boss fan, I was expecting a lot more to revolve around THAT show and the actors and actresses that starred on it. If I had known what this DVD was really about--his talk show--I would have skipped it. You watch the Bio channel to learn about the person--their childhood, how they got into acting, what their colleagues think about them, their acting career. You don't want to focus on such a small part of the person's life, especially when there were so much better thing they could have zeroed in on. They barely mentioned Who's the Boss at all. I was disappointed. I don't recommend this DVD at all."
4,Epitafio desde el destierro,"Este es un libro triste. Existe una significativa diferencia en el tono de este libro cuando se compara con obras anteriores. Jesús Díaz echa a un lado su acostumbrado humor y nos entrega esta historia que es casi un testimonio. A ratos aparecen destellos de hilaridad pero siempre envueltos en la pesada carga del desarraigo del emigrante. Son tal vez la nostalgia del destierro y la resignación al no-regreso las causas del discurso pesaroso, a ratos resignado del que se hace eco Manuel. El libro es en resumen un sobrio tributo de Jesús Díaz a todos los Manuel que pueblan los lugares más inverosímiles de este planeta."
4,If you love OSCAR and/or TELLY- this video is for you!,"My son is 23 months old and LOVES Oscar the Grouch. I searched through the Sesame Street videos to find one in which Oscar was the primary character (my son also really likes Telly monster)- and this one features both. The ""movies"" that are reviewed by Oscar and Telly are not some of 'Sesame Street's' greatest, but on the whole, it's a cute video, and good for some laughs from the little people."
3,Sing Yourself Sillier At The Movies (1998),"Parents,This is a video tape with some comic mocvies for kids in it. My 8 year old loves Cookie Monster so I try to find video tapes that inclued him. Keep in mind you will think this is fummy to."
3,Pedantic Rant,"I really wanted to like this book because Elaine Pagels seems to endorse it and reading the Gospel of Thomas myself didn't do much for me. The book contains so many glaring spelling and grammatical errors that I can't read more than a page or two without getting frustrated. I think it seriously challenges the credibility of the author and the publisher if they can't find a decent editor, or spell-check program, to correct the manuscript. The author mistakenly attributes the saying ""To thine own self be true"" to Emerson instead of Shakespeare (Polonius says it in ""Hamlet""), he spells consensual as ""consentual"", uses advise when he means advice, uses apostrophes willy-nilly by adding them where they are not needed and forgetting them where they are and various other mistakes that detract from the otherwise not-so-bad message. I was hoping for a book with more scholarly heft but I respect the author's desire to share. I'm sorry I can't recommend it more highly."
5,My own paradise,Love this poster! I am currently deployed so I have it hanging above my bed to trick me into thinking I'm somewhere else.
4,too many footnotes. would read better w/o the constant refe,Have just gotten into text...I am distrtacted by the constant footnote reference. Would read better w/o that.
4,"An Excellent Read, But No ""Case Closed""","Posner's book is an exhaustive and compelling study of the assassination of MLK, focussing almost entirely on James Earl Ray, the barely-bright loser who decided to kill him. The level of detail is really staggering-- Posner deserves praise for following up every smidgen of info about this cretinous character. The book is worth reading-- but I would recommend reading Posner's supremely accomplished ""Case Closed"" first, if you haven't. The JFK murder offers thousands of fascinating sideroads to explore, and Posner digs into each. ""Case Closed"" is a masterstroke, so this book, covering a crime with a less compelling mystery, pales next to it."
5,Another Posner Masterpiece,"All of Posner's books have one thing in common - they are painstakenly researched and presented to the reader in a no-nonsence, matter-of-fact manner. This one is no different. Like ""Case Closed"" (about Lee Harvey Oswald), Killing the Dream spends nearly the first third of the book introducing the reader to James Earl Ray. This lets the reader in on the motives and the history of this loser. The evidence is laid out to the reader piece after piece and totally anialates the conspiracy theory wackos and exposes them as greedy, manipulate panick mongors who think that the government is a killing machine. I have to go now, my CIA handlers are going to train me in torture techniques."
1,Read Pepper instead,"The so-called 'facts' have been coloured by the author's bias (ultimately he wants to prove that Ray was a mad lone gunman, which borders on naive stupidity). Forget about this - read 'Orders to Kill: The Truth Behind the Murder of Martin Luther King, Jr' by William F. Pepper, Dexter Scott King, instead, which is much more compelling. Pepper was a former associate of King who later became Ray's lawyer."
1,Predictable Posnerisms,"Why am I not surpised at the conclusions that Mr. Posner draws in his new book? This would be an excellent book for the ""lone nutter"" who is blissfully unaware of any of the facts surrounding King's Assassination . Any reader with even cursory knowledge of this tragic event would be wise to give Mr Posner's most recent ""disinformation"" a wide berth."
1,Conveniently ignores much info.,"Gerald Posner doesn't tell the readers that several black fireman, (and he glosses over)..at least one Black Detective were removed just before the Assassination. Now I would like to ask Mr. Posner..if James Earl Ray removed these men? Two Trials have vindicated Ray not being the shooter-HBO & King family Vs. Jowers. There is no solid evidence Ray fired a weapon in the several years before the Assassination- No one saw anyone shoot from the Bathroom window, yet several people saw a mysterious figure in the bushes right after the shots- no fingerprints of Ray in the Bathroom or Rooming House...Just on that Bundle left behind.It wasn't Ray who wrote an anonymous letter to Dr. King coercing him to commit suicide..It was done under the auspices of J. Edgar Hoover Read Orders To Kill..there's far too much to deny."
2,Disappointing,"There's enough information here to make a good ""New Yorker"" article. Posner has to stretch dreadfully to turn his research into a book. Quite a disappointment after ""Case Closed."""
3,cute but lacking,"I do like that it is a board book and therefore child safe for my 2 1/2 year old, she loves to look at the illustrations, as they are on every page and very well done. BUT as previously stated by others, this book is essentially exerts from all the other Pooh books. These exerts are cute but there are some that end rather abruptly leaving one hanging. Even though my daughter knows all the Pooh stories by heart she was rather bemused on a few of the pages when they ended without resolution."
1,A dissapointment,I was disappointed in this book. It seemed to be more of a show piece that sits of a shelf and looks pretty then a book that would capture the attention of a little one. my kids were less then impressed with this book and it ended up in a donate pile :(
5,Schumann's forgotten opera,"Genoveva, Robert Schumann's only opera, has unfortunately never entered the repertory, due largely to unfounded contemporry criticisn at the time of its first performances in 1850. This opera is vintage Schumann, full of delightful music. The story of a faithful wife is familiar, in Fidelio and Handel's Rodelinda. This performance is excellent, with Fischer-Diesgau as the heroic husband. The opera desrves resurrection and performnce t in today's repertory."
5,Absolutely KILLER Paella!,"I discovered this at the World Market. Though the canned ingredients are good, they are a bit on the sparse side. So, i picked up a package of frozen seafood at Trader Joe's, threw in some artichoke hearts,sliced red peppers, and some pitted Kalamata Olives. The result was fabuloso!"
5,Ben,"I love Paella...my family loves Paella!! This product is extremely hard to find in markets. Using this product eliminates all the normal preparation of paella and reduces your prep time to a minimum. You can add additional seafood, chicken, or pork to suit your taste in order enhance your enjoyment of the food. I order it in case lots of 6 and that quantity usually last my family about two months. They love it too!!"
3,Quick Paella,"Vigo provides a base to whip us a quick paella. I add onions, red and green pepper, olives, garlic and shrimp to speedily make a paella when I don't have much time. It's a staple in our pantry"
5,The real deal,"Enjoyed my Paella meal enormously, added some medium shrimp, cod chunks and Chorizo sausage. I am so glad I purchased this item, I haven't yet found a restaurant in Central FL. that offers this dish and I really fancy it now and again. The spices are perfect, just like I remember and the price is very good also. Big thank you to Amazon and Vigo for being original and catering for expats. You can find many of the things you miss on Amazon, eBay is lagging way behind.................Can't beat free shipping either.........."
5,Excellent Dinner,"This is a quick, easy and flavorful meal for those days when you just don't have a clue what to cook for your family. Every thing that you will need for paella is in the box - yellow rice, seasonings, seafood, vegetables and oil. You can add more seafood/veggies if you like. I add more canned mussels from Vigo. I'm making my fifth box tonight; I only have one left. I will need to replenish my stock. This brand I highly recommend!"
3,it was ok,"it basiclie said the things u all ready knew . but the tips on how to get it going, the resipies , and fun idia's were great!"
3,Not so great.,"I bought two boxes of these markers, one for each of my daughters. However, one pink ran out of ink before we were done with one picture of our coloring books (within half an hour of opening the box on the day that we received it in the mail). We switched to the second pink from the other box and that pink ran out of ink too. The tan was also drying by the end of the first picture.I probably wouldn't have bought this product if I knew that the pink and tan would run out this quickly. We did use the markers to color in the picture, so maybe this is not the intended use? Maybe they are meant solely for outlining. Another note, these markers may be washable off skin (haven't had to try that yet), but it does make a note on the box that it will only wash off some clothes, and not to use these markers near things that can't be laundered i.e. carpets, couches, walls, etc. Unfortunately, I will not be buying these again as they do not serve my needs."
1,Good for adults .. kids .. messey hands,These pens just leaks ink and not good for .. get the costly magic wonder if your kid is old enough to handle the delay in the color showing up
1,DOES NOT WASH OFF WALLS!!,"I'm a painter and my client let her kids write all over the walls of the room I was about to paint, assuming that ""washable"" markers would actually wash off. WRONG! It took ammonia cleaner, magic eraser, SoftScrub, three coats of spackle and TEN coats of primer to get rid of it!!! Do yourself (and your painter) a favor and don't let your kids write on your walls with these!!!"
3,Do not wash off as easily as they should,"My girls love to color with markers but I rarely let them use them at home because there is so much mess involved. No matter how neat they TRY to be, some color always gets on their hands or arms. And the color does NOT wash off that easily. I have scrubbed my kids' hands countless times trying to get the marker off only to have to just leave it to fade over the next day. And yes, we used the ""washable"" markers. Both my girls come home from school with marks on them even though their teachers have them wash right after art period. Sorry...but I will stick with crayons!"
5,Trusted Crayola,"Crayola products are always a great purchase. They last, they're inexpensive, and kids love to color. Win-win combination. I liked the size of these. They are long and big, perfect for little hands. Colors are fun, bright, and easy for a three year old to hold."
5,Washable Markers,Easier shopping online!!!!Product arrived as scheduled.Shipment packaging and product packaging were in great shape.Product was exactly as described on webpage.
3,"Big, Strong, Easy Hole Puncher","Definitely a strong feel to it, but I did get it as a replacement to a lost Swingline: Swingline Easy Touch Heavy Duty Paper Punch - A7074300J, which I have to say was a better feel and more authoritative than this model. I am sure the left / right thing is helpful, but the center feel on the Swingline is better for both."
2,could re-design better gripping surface,Just started using this today. Maybe it's just me but I had a hard time pulling out and turning the lock which opens the punch to accept paper. The mfg. could re-design this with a better gripping surface so you could get hold of it more easily.
1,Won't adjust for 7-punch on an 8.5 inch piece of paper,"I bought this product looking to have a multi-sheet ability to punch 7 holes in a piece of paper to fit in a Franklin-Covey style ""classic"" binder. (5.5 in. by 8.5 in.)Much to my disappointment, it was not as adjustable as I needed it to be. Although I had the 7 punches, the space is designed such that I could not put the seven punches where I needed them. There are several spaces along the track which are solid so I couldn't put the punches there.It was not clear from the descriptions or the photographs that this item is not fully adjustable."
3,Could have been a great product,"Product works as advertised so you would assume it is a good product but you know what they say about assuming. What is NOT advertised is that the punch heads sit in three separate tracks and you can only adjust the punch heads so much. I purchased this product to punch seven equidistance holes in my preprinted checks so the stubs could be held in a binder. Due to the products limitations, I can punch only five holes in the proper positions and have to manually punch single holes for the other two.If this product had a single track so the punch heads were fully adjustable I would have given it a five star rating."
1,Stay away if you want this for a datebook....,"7 heads = good; Where they go = very, very bad. You cannot adjust this for desk datebooks, and the punches sold by Franklin Covey and Day Timer are getting bad ratings. Where is a person to go for a good hole punch these days?Grrrr."
2,Frustrated,"This product does not set up very easily for seven holes - we have a daytimer system and we were not able to""adjust"" to their seven hole system. Very disappointed. This was very misleading."
1,do not buy!!!!,"I never write comments on the items i purchase however in this case i had to. This is the 2nd purchase of same item, 1st one broke and now this one. This item is garbage only had this one for 4 months. would never recommend this to a friend."
4,bright colors and easy to use,"very bright colors, good grip, odor isn't overpowering. Chisel tip allows for various design. good product, I'd buy these again, for the price."
4,"Ideal as a refresher, NOT for learning the language","First, this is an excellent French reference book. I took quite a bit of French in school, but needed some in-depth review so I could help my home-schooled daughter with her ""passe compose"". Perfect book for that... or if you need to review your reflexive verbs, etc. Well laid out... rules are explained in depth, but in very understandable terms.Unfortunately, though, this book markets itself as a beginner's book. ""Learning a language has never been so quick and easy - or so much fun!"" the back cover boasts. I love the French language, but this is NOT a ""fun"" book... it is 98% grammar, 2% practice. You can literally go pages without seeing a sentence in French."
4,Useful Add-on French Manual,"This book is a welcome addition to anyone learning French. It is probably best for one who has had a semester of French, but I have found it to be one of the better review books. I think the layout is good and the additional CD gives a plus to the text. For me, one of the better French language books I have purchased."
4,Misleading. Not for Beginners.,"Excellent book, but title is misleading: this is not a book for beginners.Pros:-Good for those who studied French a while back and need a quick refresher-Good for those with basic understanding of grammar and grammatical terms/phrases/concepts-Book explains grammatical concepts wellCons:-Bad for those who have never studied French-While it explains grammatical concepts, the book too much assumes you already know basic English grammar-Book lacks quantity and quality in exercises/ practice questionsIf you have never studied French or English grammar, I do not recommend this book but try instead ""Easy French Step By Step: Master High-Frequency Grammar for French Proficiency-Fast!"" by Rochester and Bregstein."
4,A Healthy Bowl of Electro a Day Keeps Bordom Away,Elctro Juice vol. 2 fulfilled all of my expectations that volume 1 gave me. Volume 2 has 12 new electro tracks from great electro producers such as Ectomorph. The tracks demonstrate the great way Electro may sound frantic and chilled out at the same time. The music on this album is filled with many artist all showing the listener how they've added their own touch to Electro. Electro was once more popular than Techno or House amongst the Detroit clubs and is regaining its popularity through the release of such CD's as Electro Juice vol. 2 and other CDs produced by TomTom from Aux 88. These new releases have caused the mind bending synthesized sounds of electro to regain their popularity. I strongly recommend this CD for anyone looking to add something different to his or her CD collection.
5,System Compatibility,"Not being much of a techie, I didn't pay attention to the possibility that this older PC game might not be compatible with my Windows 7 operating system. Upon initial installation it seems to work fine, but in subsequent attempts to open, it requests that the disc be inserted and then the system doesn't recognize that the disc is in place. I am in the processing of installing compatibility software hoping to overcome this situation. Entirely my fault and not the fault of the product."
5,This games the best,ive had this game for a few years now and I still love it this game is the best computer game ever. Youve got to buy it! gameplay 5/5 stars! I play this game hours at a time. Once I start playing it I never stop. It mad fun!!!
1,Can't even get this game to load on XP computer,"You would think a game by Microsoft would load on a computer running Microsoft Windows XP, but the computer hangs up every time during the installation process. As mentioned in another review, bought 4 games, 2 worked fine, 2 not so good."
3,i like it~!,i like the game its fun. i just need to get use to it. i need to read up on how to do more things and build things right!
5,THIS IS ADDICTING......FOR KIDS ALSO!!!!,"This game has lost us many ours of sleep...I love the graphics, and how real everything sounds. My kids are just as addicted to is as I am.....plus it is a great learning tool. They know what all the animals need to make them happy, and they have learned so many things about different animals..things they never even would have known before...and that includes myself. I HIGHLY recommend this game for everyone!!"
5,The Best Money I Ever Spent!!!,"This game has it all!!! I'll sit there for hours a one time playing Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection. This game is worth 5 stars. I couldn't wait for it to get delievered. When it got to my house I was so happy. I automatically downloaded it to my computer and played it for like, 3 hours. It's definitly worth every penny. This game is worth buying."
5,This game is AWESOME,"This game rocks. It's endless hours of entertainment. The only problem right now is, I lost my CD and now I can't play it! Although there are a limited number of scenarios on the game, people have become so obsessed with it that they have created their own scenarios - just as good as the ones the games come with. You can easily download them from http://zoo.ogresnet.com/ which also features great message boards if you need help with anything. (I hope I'm allowed to plug that here - I have nothing to do with the creation of that website, I'm just a big fan of it!). I would recommend this game to anyone. It's absolutely fantastic!"
3,Nostalgia,This game is really only enjoyable if you played it when you were a kid like me. It has a lot more animals than its successor but the gameplay and graphics are not as good.
1,DOES ANYONE HAVE THIS GAME MADE IN THE U.S.?,"I want Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection made by Microsoft Game Studios in the U.S.But, I think most of these games are from Ubisoft, a European company. If it is from Ubisoft, the game can be installed in English, Dutch, German and a couple other languages. If you have the necessary system requirements, the game will probably work on your computer."
2,Zoo Tycoon,"I bought it thinking it would be the same Zoo Tycoon that I had (and lost). As it turns out, it was an earlier edition that did not have all the animals and extra things to put into the zoo. I am very disappointed."
3,Good game,Bought this for my 6 and 8 year olds because they really like World of Zoo on the Wii. They enjoyed the game for a while but have not maintained interest in it like some of their other games. Not sure why. Its an old game but still enjoyable. Plays on Windows 7 with no problem.
4,It is awsome but it gets boring,"When you first purchase this item you get an an awsom expierience yet you know little of all the unlockables, I know little of the unlockables, so you have to check out a cheat website. If you are new to the tycoon world then this is you're game, so when you start playing this game you realize I WANT ANOTHER TYCOON!!!!!!!!!!!! So you buy another tycoon and get bored of this Zoo Tycoo. I'd know.I hope this review was helpful!"
1,ZOO TYCOON ZOOKEEPER'S COLLECTION WILL NOT WORK,"Parents. Please save yourself the aggrivation and hours of time on the phone with Microsoft if you are trying to put this game on an HP Pavillion. My new HP Pavillion has 2 gig memory and all the bells and whistles that should play circles around this game but it crashes between 4 - 20 minutes every time my daughter tries to play it. It works wonderfully on my Dell, Windows XP machine, although she can't play it on its highest settings. After many hours of speaking to a nice man in India, I have opted to return the computer. That's how much my daughter likes the game.... just be aware it won't work on all computers."
1,Don't buy!,"I bought this game thinking it would work on my Windows 7 computer, but when I tried loading it, they said a file was missing on the disk and it wouldn't load without it. COMPLETE waste of time & money."
2,Not very interesting,"It was quite confusing to me, and all the people kept leaving the zoo and becoming sad. And then you had to take care of the animals and they were always sad. I think the funnest part of this game was building the zoo. After that it was boring and pretty downright stupid. But, hey, if you don't agree with me, that's fine, because I was pretty clueless. I just think you should get a little more information before choosing to buy this. Trust me, it won't be worth your time."
4,Excellent game for fans of simulation games,"If you're a fan of simulation games, such as SimCity or the older Sim games, you will enjoy this game a lot. The goal is simple, to run a successful zoo by keeping the guests and the animals happy without running out of money. If you are someone who needs an ending point or a way to ""win,"" you probably won't enjoy this game as much. The scenerios add a bit of a goal and are fun for when you want more of a challenge.It's also a great game for kids. It has a very realistic feel to it, and gets you thinking about animal habitats. It also allows for great use of creativity in planning the zoos. The addition of dinosaurs and marine animals makes this set even more appealing for children."
4,This game rocks!!!!!!,This game rocks! When I first played the game it was a little confusing. But when I played more it got easier. One flaw was that unhappy guests dont always tell you why they are upset. There are cheats that you find online that help you get more money. But some cheats shut your game down so you cant play anymore! That happened a couple times to me but you learn! I hope my review helped!
5,Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection,My two boys ages 12 and 10 have enjoyed playing Zoo Tycoon. I don't feel as if they are completely wasting their time with this game as they are learning how to set up a zoo. Very educational.
4,Good basic clock,The numbers are big and easy to read. I was trying to find the simplest clock I could find for my aging parents to replace an alarm clock that was too complicated with too many extra buttons and features. This one fits the bill but was smaller than I expected. I docked a point because the rocker switch that turns the alarm on and off is flimsy but difficult to move easily. Otherwise a product that does exactly what is supposed to do without extra button clutter.
3,Breaking Away,"This is the most overrated Dennis Quaid film of all times. I thought the movie was very slow paced. I also had heard from critics that this was a funny movie. It was a very depressing movie about four 19 year olds who decide to drop out of society by not attending college or finding jobs. They call themselves the ""Cutters"" for two reasons they are the children of stone cutters and they decided to ""cut"" college. The one boy begins to work in his father's used car business but his father has a heart attack. The father then realizes that there is a place in this world for dreams. He allows his son to persue his love of bicycling. The four boys decide to enter a bicycle contest as a 4 man team although only the one boy is interested in bicycling. I do have to say at least the four learn the importance of teamwork and end up winning the race."
2,Title Misleading,"Although the title indicates that the book describes welding basics, the book doesn't describe the basic techniques used to weld. Lots of pictures but no practical steps on how to weld. If you've never welded before, don't expect this book to teach you."
1,Welding Basics,This book covers the very low level basics and should be used by people who can not tell the difference between a straight blade screwdriver and a phillips screwdriver.The book even walks you through plugging the machine in....if someone needs this kind of help they may want to go to a public library or even better....Everything that is in the book is available free on the internet.I would pass on this if I were a person needing practical welding help....and use the saved money on better welding consumables.
5,Welding Basics,Excellent book for beginners. Well written and illustrated. Covers all basic modes of welding and brazing. Invaluable for my TAFE NSW (OZ) course.
3,Good for Beginners,Decent book if you have little or no knowledge of welding. A little too basic if you already know how to weld and are looking to learn more.
5,Great item!,"Great item! Arrived very fast, and was in GREAT shape. Bouthgt as a Christmas gift for an uncle that has been wanting this book for a long time, I bet he will love it!"
3,How to weld,The book is good for starters. It is a bit vague on the basics but informative. A good starter book.
4,I have mixed feelings about this re-release,"When this recording was first released in the 1980s, it was a stupendous example of Peter Allen's skills as a songwriter and a performer. Unfortunately, this re-release is something of a hatchet job. Several sections of Peter Allen talking to the audience, explaining songs or just demonstrating his charming personality, have been mysteriously deleted. The songs are brilliant and deserve a good listen, because Peter Allen remains a sorely underrated musician. But the omission of Peter's interplay with the audience is a real disservice both to Peter Allen and his fans."
5,Great book for beginers,"This is a wonderful book for parents who would like to use herbal remedies, but don't know where to start. Dr. Christopher's book is simple and interesting to read. He offers information on cause of disease and how to avoid it, wonderful information on nutrition, an alphabetical list of common childhood aliments with herbal remedies, and a section on how to's i.e. how to make an herbal tea, a fomentation, and a poltice and more. I love this book, I find myself turning to it time and time again!"
4,Good Herbal Medicine Book,I really like this book. I wish though that the ingredients had the amounts of each written with it. It is difficult to find how much of each ingredient you use in the formulation. I do have a great deal of respect for the Doctor.
5,Very informative.,"Good reading. It has a lot of treatments for different problems. I love his formulas, especially the tinctures and liquid extracts. However they are very expensive. It doesn't seem so since most bottles cost about $10 to $12 for about 50 capsules, but for just about every item you have to take 2 capsules three times a day. If you paid $12 for a bottle of 50 and took 6 a day the bottle would only last you about 8-1/2 days, so I only buy the formulas I feel I need the most. The book is great though and you can buy your own herbs online. I would definitely recommend the book."
5,To Watch Again and Again and Again....,"We bought this DVD about 18 months ago after our toddler had fallen in love with whale books and a whales and dolphins screen saver. My wife and I loved it from the very first time we watched it and our son continues to request it again and again and again, these 18 months later. There is excellent footage taken off the coast of New England by a whale watching company, mostly of lobtailing, breaching, flipper slapping, spy hopping and any other whale activity you can think of. Some of the most awesome footage is of humpbacks feeding with huge open jaws right next to the boat. Highly recommended."
4,Good Serial Killing Movie,"If you liked Natural Born Killers you are going to love this movie. Written way before NBK it follows to life of a serial killer, Allen. When he finds one of his victoms already murdered, he investigates ho did the killing. It turns out to be another serial killer, The two hook up, eventually fall in love, and go on a serial killing adventure you will never forget."
1,"Sick, twisted, disturbing, and cr@p!!!!!!!","This video is despicable and perverse!!! How can anyone make a video like this?!! Whoever made this sick flick should get mental help. It was stupid for me to even rent the morbid thing. It haunted me for days after I watched it. Don't buy it or rent it!!! It's cheesy, beyond morbid, and too sick to be enjoyable. Watch Friday the 13th, The Exorcist, Hellraiser, but please avoid this..."
1,Wrong Ad For Lousy Markers,First they said in the advertisement that the markers were Sanford Colorific Markers but they were Sanford Foohy markers. I tried them they were nothing like I wanted and the markers weren't even good color quality expect for the blue marker.
5,Alia microfiber pants size 10P,"Delivered in a timely manner, in excellent condition. The fit is great. (I'm under 5 feet tall and have a hard time getting a good fit.) The fabric is nice too, and comfortable. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
2,So So,"Okay pants. Microfiber does not stretch; order to size; if you wear a 14 buy 14 if you wear a 16 but can squeeze into a 14 buy the 16 you will be happier with the comfort; average petite fits a 27 inch inseam exactly, no room for high heels and shows a lot of ankle when you sit. The white pants are very see-through, so cover with shirt tail or full underwear. If I hadn't already torn off the tags, I would have sent them back."
4,Cool lamp,"I sent this to my niece for her birthday so I haven't seen it in person, but my sister in law said it is a very cool lamp and that it looks great in my nieces bedroom."
1,Save your money and go to My Space,"I can't believe this book achieved publication. The writing is aweful, the storyline is not there and you could read something like this book for free if you just go to my space or livejournal and read some blog entries. The only thing that gives me comfort isthat I only paid 4 bucks for this instead of 10.This book is dissapointing, boring and a waste of time and money."
3,Could be thinner,"The title ""Extra Fine Point"" led me to believe these pens would have a finer point than the ""Fine Point"" Sharpie felt tip pens, but they don't. That belief was about 95% of my buying decision, so I was not too happy to realize that. However, the pens work beautifully, but tend to dry out when using them for extended periods of time. The other 5% reason to buy was to test how long the pens last against the Sharpie pens I had previously bought. These tend to last longer if I don't keep the cap off too long during classes in between notes. Overall, a nice product, but don't expect anything thinner than your typical ""Fine Point"" pen."
5,"THIN POINT, GREAT PEN","This PEN is GREAT. It has a thin point and very bright ink.The only comment I have is for you to make sure to NOT drop it on the floor.If that perfect thin point hits the ground, the pen is garbage.Otherwise, GREAT.I'd say... Buy it. (And be careful)"
1,Worked once of twice before they dried up.,"I bought a box of these for an art class I am teaching. After using once of twice, minimally, they don't work at all. Some of them didn't write, right out of the box. These are a horrible waste of money. I have to buy all new pens now, after just two uses."
1,don't like it,I thought it was going to be a nice pen considering I love using fine point pen... but i'd rather use r-501 from mitsubishi... very disappointed
1,Needles are normally made of metal,"In the description of this pen, it says that the tip type is ""needle."" Maybe I'm in the wrong here, but I figured that since needles are made of metal, the tip of this pen would be metal as well. It's not, it's made of felt. If that's what you're looking for, this pen is great, but if you wanted a fine pen which you could apply some pressure to, this pen is not what you're looking for."
5,Mightier Than The Sword,"All of the most powerful men I've ever known use this pen. It's pure magic. Ball points are for losers. Felt in the HOUSE!I was hanging out with God the other day, and I'm like, ""Yo God, what pen you use?"" and he's like, ""Pilot Razor, recognize ho"".then I was like ""aw yeah son"". Then we hugged."
5,Great pens!,These pens are great! I use them for work - I work in research so I write a lot - and everyone always wants to use my pens. I highly recommend them.
4,"Great product, some reservations","I used this paint to add a copper ""look"" to some of the edging on my wood kitchen cabinets. It looks wonderful, as if it were real copper, but there were a few things to consider. First, it doesn't react 100% to turpentine for thinning....bottle said to use something else I couldn't find, so that was a bit of a problem. It did tend to muck up pretty quickly on my brush, which was a bit annoying.Secondly, it is very susceptible to any kind of wear....I had to put several coats of varnish over it, to protect it from any stain or mark. It is very sensitive to dirt, oil, etc.Otherwise it really is great for a copper ""look,"" to be sure, for decorative projects.Oh, and order in advance of your needs if you are paying standard shipping. It takes a while for it to leave the plant."
2,Havent used them yet.,These markers seem to be good but I havent let my 2 year old use 'm yet because they are rather large and with the extra big tip its probably gonna me very messy!
5,Great !,Excellent as usual.Always a pleasure to get what you paid for. My granddaughter is a very happy customer. THANK YOU
2,crayola 8ct washable bold board makers.,when arrived in mail some of the caps were off and those were dried up and not useable. expected better product
3,Not all colors are washable!!!!!,"I don't know if I just got a bad batch or not, but the teal and the emerald colors in my box are NOT washable. All the other colors rinse off easily - don't even need soap.. The teal and the emerald will not come off, not even with soap and a brush."
3,"Alot of Fun, but breaks easily.","The bodies of these markers are black, so it can be hard to tell which marker each cap goes on. And I think it breaks so easyly. That said, my nice loved and painted me a drawing for my b-day. I was so happy and prooud. So in general, I loved it the product."
1,Black barrel needs to go,"I bought my kids (4,2) two sets of these for Easter to replace the old ones that were getting dry. The black barrel is ridiculous. You cannot match the lid with the pen. With the old markers, my kids were so proud of themselves when they matched the lid to the marker. We used it as a tool to learn colors and learn the concept of matching. Now, I cannot tell what lid goes with what marker unless I draw with it first. When we are in a hurry, we now grab any old lid and put it on the marker. Then the kids get frustrated the next time they want blue and end up drawing with purple instead. As soon as I can find a replacement, these are going in the trash."
1,Do Not Like the New Black Barrel,"First of all don't let the picture of the box with the white barrel fool you, I've ordered/returned twice and it's been the black barrel both times. This version is not as appealing for younger kids especially since the marker barrel doesn't indicate color and the caps/markers are always getting mismatched. Also, these are just plain drab to look at - not bright and inviting as the previous version. I won't be buying these again anytime soon."
3,Coccyx Wedge,I'm 36 and developing RA symptoms. The wedge is OK. I was hoping it would be just a tad firmer. It does relieve some of the tailbone pain I have while seated.
2,Lousy print job!,"I've just begun reading the book, and the writing itself seems excellent. But the print job is terrible. Looks like a bad photocopy: the letters are not sharp, and many of the illustrations look like they've been soaked in mud; for example, the print of Dürer's ""Melencolia I"" is so dark not a single number of the ""magic square"" can be read. Maybe the printers thought a dark, blotchy, blottered look appropriate for a book on melancholy."
3,Not as bouncy.,"These balls fall a little short in the bouncy department. I tried 4 of them in a near-empty room this morning and 3 of the balls bounced only a half-bounce. A letdown, for sure."
1,Not as described,"I ordered what I thought was 144 ping pong balls and received 6. I paid $5 for 6 ping pong balls. The quantity said 144 so im not sure how many people they are scamming selling ping pong balls for almost $1 each, but I was NOT HAPPY!! Decided it wasnt worth the fight for $5 so I just ordered what I needed off of ebay. (Got 144 for $8)"
4,Pilot pen,I love these pens. They do not bleed through the paper. The color selection they come in is also great. The only problem is that in the last pack I did end up with 2 that leaked on your fingers as you wrote. Otherwise these are the best pens I have found.
3,Nice colours but,I have these pens in the Fine point but ordered these because they had colours not available in the UK. However you have to be careful not write down too hard as the nib tends to split. Hopefully Pilot will do the Fine point range in Pink and Light Blue
3,not that great,"the light blue one came dry on arrival. and didn't work. other ones are ok, not as great as i thought they'd be."
4,These are my FAVORITE pens (and I'm a total pen snob),"I've been buying these regularly for the past seven years or so at the local big-box office supply store -- so you can imagine my elation at finding them cheaper online!The only problem: the black pen was dry. Bummer.But otherwise, these all seem full of ink and work perfectly. I love the way these pens write -- fine tip, no smudging, fun colors.I'd highly recommend them!"
5,Absolutely my most favorite pens!,"I have been purchasing these pens at Staples for at least a few years...and suddenly I can't find them anymore!I have been in a panic...worried that Pilot stopped making them. These pens are great for writing in small spaces, and my writing is always nice and neat when I use them. I like to use the different colors...and find that different days I am in the mood for different colors, or I like to use certain colors for certain things. I am so relieved to find them on Amazon!"
5,The only pen you will ever need,"I used to buy these pens in college because they were some of the best for the money and the different colors made it easy to separate my notes. This is one of the few extra fine point liquid pens you can get that when you hold it down to a piece of paper it doesn't bleed through and make a mess like others do. Also, the fact that there are 8 different colors makes it easy to use for separating or color coding because they are colors that you won't always find everywhere else. There's blue, sky blue, black, brown, pink, purple, green and red. Overall, I think they're a best buy for whatever you'd like to do but particularly for taking notes, grading papers, or copy editing. I would definitely recommend buying them when back to school season rolls around."
5,Awesome,"I first heard this song by Chely herself, as she performed her creations on an army base. We should respect those that fight for our freedom, for our way of life and for our lives. God bless them and God bless us all..."
5,Had to have it!,"My son graduated from USMC Boot Camp two weeks ago and this song was on the big screen just prior to the Marines entering the building. Emotion was running high as most had not seen their loved ones for many months. The Marines, too, have wanted to find this song, and have it for their own. We went right out and bought it. Thanks, Chely, from a wife and mom of a United States Marine(I am married to one, as well!)."
1,Quite Sad...,"It is sad how stupid some people are who buy crap like this. I mean this song is horrible and just exploits the feelings and emotions people have concerning ""the Troops"". I mean the song is just horrible, and the same people who buy this crap are the same ones who burned the the Dixie Chicks cds, which have more talent in there little toe than chely wright will ever have. Hey Chely too bad this song will not raise you above the barely famous moniker you already have, just ask Darryl ""I wrote the worst song of all time"" Worley about that. People should be ashamed for buying this cd and the exploitation that comes with it."
5,superb,"i've ordered this from the official fanclub and its wonderful,you know its Suede,no words,especially the bsides are wonderful"
3,I love it when it's working,"I love my roomba when it's working - it even gets dog hair out of the carpet. If I can get a dependable one it will be well worth the cost and I would rate it 5 stars.Problem 1 - After a few days it stopped working properly. It runs for a couple of minutes then stops. It's not the battery - I tried 2 of them.Problem 2 - I bought it from Amazon instead of somewhere cheaper because it is so easy to return merchandise. I didn't realize (although I should have) that it's not actually being shipped from Amazon so it doesn't have the same easy-return policies. I'm still trying to figure out how to get this Roomba replaced.It is a fantastic invention and with a little more quality control I could easily recommend this to everyone I know. I hope they work out the bugs - this is a great time saver. Before mine broke, my floors were spotless all the time."
1,It worked for a month,"This is truly a great idea, but after a month of use, the battery stopped holding a charge. I brought back to the store, and got a new battery with an attachment to prevent this battery from breaking, but it did not fix the problem. I have not returned the second time. My sister has one as well, which broke after the 4th month, and Roomba replaced it. That was about a year ago, and she is on her 4th Roomba. Each time she goes in, gets a replacement, and it breaks. She is fine with this, as she feels that going to the store for a new one every so often is less effort than vacuuming. It does seem that the more she uses it, the longer it lasts. Just be warned."
1,It Broke It Broke It Broke,"I love this thing! I have three dogs and lots of dog hair. To have a 'Bot clean the house while I cook breakfast is a wondeful concept. And the concept worked when it worked. When the concept did not work was when it did not work. The Roomba broke within two months of purchase. They were great and replaced it. The new one broke again. And now the third one broke. They all seem to have the same problem. After a month or so of usage, they buzz around like a scattered and confused droid. Backs up and backs up and backs up. Starts. Stops. Turns. Turns off again. Maybe the 'Bot is not up to the task of dog hair - I dont know. All I know is I have now had three, each one broke, and I am shopping for a new vacuum. (these are the robots our military are going to take into combat???)"
3,Service a hassle,Roomba's service is less than stellar. When mine died I was told to ship it and they would ship a new one two days after receipt. Two weeks went by-nothing. Called. Was told that they were out of product--two weeks more to ship. Asked for expedited shipping since we were leaving on vacation. Told this was impossible. Asked for supervisor. Was told she would have to call me back later. Asked for name of president. Suddenly supervisor was available and did expedite shipping. Wrote president to outline whole long and laborious process. President has never answered my letter. Service was a real hassle
3,"All right, but not as good as previous works","Somewhere between 1992 and 1996 Kilauea lost it's sizzle. This CD had not been reviewed prior and I wondered why. I believe it must be because it did not resonate with smooth jazz listeners of the time. I can understand why; it lacks the passion and vision of previous works and the music is lackluster. There are still some good tracks, but ""Our Last Goodbye"" is a repeat from Tropical Pleasures and there are four tracks that are instrumental versions of popular vocal songs. Apparently after this CD, Kilauea did not continue. A few groups continue including Fourplay and The Rippingtons but Kilauea did not for whatever reason. I wonder if it is a loss of vision and passion for the smooth jazz genre as Mr. Ho, the heart and soul of the group, went on to write produce and perform Hawaiian music."
2,"at best, a bland collection","I read a number of stories in this book under assignment for a class called ""social consequences of technology"". Through these stories, we were able to discuss a number of benefits and costs related to different technologies, like the internet, weapons of mass construction, and simple verbal communication. I enjoy reading science fiction regularly, so i was happy to learn that we would be using such a book in class.Well, to be brief, some stories were good, and some were pointless. My favorite must be ""Speech Sounds"" by Octavia Butler, which explores the fears of a society robbed of communication skills. Some other stories were fair, but some were not worth reading after the first couple sentences. Doris Lessing's contribution falls under this category. Even the best stories in this selection were not that great. There's plenty of better collections out there."
4,4 piece set just like OEM....,There is no mounting plate included in this hardware set. It is four pieces.-Washer-Cup-Upper bushing-Lower bushingLooks just like OEM parts.
5,love it!!,One of the greatest adult comics ever written. If you haven't read this series your missing out. Warren elise and derick Robertson hit one out of the park. A must read for any fan of dystopian scifi.
4,Great highlander romance,This was a good and well written book with wonderful characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the H was wonderful and gorgeous. The reason that I didn't give this the 5th star is because of how annoying and shrewish the h was for the first part of the book. I was really irritated by her and because the author writes well she did manage to redeem her in my eyes.Highly recommended!
2,I had high hopes but in a word: Underwhelming,I really thought I would like this book slot. It had A Highlander and a spunky but tender heroine and an adorable motherless tyke. Unfortunately it was slow moving and predictable and I felt like yelling at the hero to stop being such a bonehead and figure out the identity of the villain. Had to force myself to finish it.
2,A little bland,"It was an easy enough read and I enjoyed it for what it was. Mostly I found the characters/plot to be very flat and one dimensional. The language was also VERY repetitive, especially the dialogue. That alone convinced me not to continue reading the series unfortunately."
2,Not the exciting steamy romance I hopped for,"I had high hopes for this book and was looking to get into a new author and series. This book just didn't do it for me. There's hardly any dialogue between the two characters, the story is primarily told by the depressing thoughts of Page and Iain. Page is one of the most depressing characters I've ever read. The entire book is spent hearing her negative perception of herself and feeling she has to act ""tough"". Past reviews spoke of a steamy romance, I beg to differ. The romance in this book is very PG13."
2,Needs a Proof Read,The story was good but it had a ton of grammatical errors. Misplaced punctuation being the worst. I was still able to enjoy the story but it truly bugged me that I could not fix the mistakes. If you are as I am you will be tormented by this issue.
5,superb,A very well written book that takes your heart through every possible emotion and ends with a very contented sigh.
4,FUn read,Not too trashy. Good characters. Good story. I really dislike the trashy romance novels and though there are love scenes this isnt too much.
4,The Mackinnon's Bride,"It was a great book but, I wish that it wasn't so explicit on the sex. Leave to my imagination please. I would not let my teenage daughter read this because of it.Great story line. Just to much explaining of the sex encounters."
4,Sweet and charming,"The Mackinnon's Bride is a magically wonderful story. Once you start reading it, you can't but willingly let yourself be drawn into it. The plot steals you in like a gentle winter storm, and all you have to do is get in and be swept away, charmed. I can surely say that this novel is almost perfect, and the little spoilers just go unnoticed and forgiven. Enjoy the read."
4,Highland Brides,I really enjoyed this book a lot. I've been into reading highland romance books lately and this series caught my eye. I got a laugh out of Page's saucy personality and her mouth. The only negative thing about the book is it wasn't quite long enough.
4,Very good.,Loved the story and the people! I wish it would have went little further in details at the last about how he over came the lies that were told and so on. But really liked it over all.
3,No Songs Listed...,"From Another site...Each book in the Acoustic Solo Series contains complete transcriptions from the artists themselves in full standard notation and tablature. Performance notes are also included. The full original recording of each song is featured on the included CD.Twelve spectacular solo guitar arrangements, all in standard tuning (with a few simple variations), from David Cullen, Mike Dowling, Laurence Juber, Al Petteway, Doug Smith, and Kenny Sultan. The 12 songs provide an amazing overview of styles and techniques for solo guitar. From swing and blues to contemporary instrumental guitar styles, each piece will make a terrific addition to any solo guitarist's concert repertoire. Titles: The 5:55 * Bahama Beach * Blue Counterpoint * Crest of the Revolution * Go Ahead and Play * Groove Etude * Indigo Blue * Midari * Nitpickin' * Slippin' and Drippin' * Sunday Sonata * The Tempest."
3,"Good movie, but viewpoint is getting old.","This is a good movie but I feel it would've been much better if told like a normal movie, rather than only from a voyueristic viewpoint. The 'Blaine Witch Project'/hidden camera viewpoint is getting a little overused and seems like a lazy way to make a movie. It's very restricted and doesn't allow you to follow the storyline in depth, which can be very frustrating. Overall a good story, but the way it was filmed leaves a lot to be desired."
2,Too Slow,"It may have been better if certain reviewers had not ruined it to start with by telling us it is a stalker. To me that was a spoiler!! But now that it was spoiled i may as well repeat it. It would have been better not to know and wonder if he was just going insane. Especially when the co-worker seems to have seen her on the screen in bed. Plus the picture on the wall says Insanity is a Matter of Opinion. That would have made you really wonder about what was actually happening. Thankfully this was a free movie on Prime. It moves too slow to keep me riveted, but it is good enough if you are just bored and in the need of a movie you haven't seen. So much more could have been done with this. But it really does make you think about how in the wrong hands technology is a very bad thing. I would have enjoyed hearing the stalker say ; "" Well, THAT was fun!"" at the end before sitting it on the shelf."
5,Best Racing for Recovery material,"I own his book, his 1st movie ""Addict,"" and this movie. I am very familiar with his story and organization. This is by far the best of his material. I work as a counselor and teacher and have utilized this movie in both capacities. The way he documents his struggles with hope for himself and others is powerful. If you are looking for a good story of how a positive addiction changed someone's life, this is it. Personally, I enjoyed the scenery in this movie as he ran his ultraIronman. The combination of story telling amongst his race was a style that kept me interested for the whole movie. I was worried because the interview style used in his first movie ""Addict"" did not keep my attention and has not gotten rave reviews from the people I have shown it to. I would recommend this to anyone interested in recovery from addiction and/or triathalons."
5,Awesome,"Everyone is affected by addiction in some way and this film is about a selfless individual who has devoted his life to helping others. I bought this film last February and I was an alcoholic runner. It took me about 10 months to go to that first counselling session but I did and I am proud too say that I am sober today and I did it with the help of Todd Crandell and Racing for Recovery. Todd is an awesome counselor, he has been there and understands as you can see in the film. As a runner, I really appreciate the coverage of the ultra, it really shows you what the body capable of. I highly recommend this film and if you know someone who is looking for help, contact Racing for Recovery."
1,"A ""real find""? I think not...","Hubay, by all accounts, was a great violinist, but, based on this recording, an average composer. Mr. Szabadi is a very good violinist, but his loud breathing often interferes with my enjoyment of his playing. Miert jatszod ezeket a darabokat, Vilmos? This volume is overpriced and a waste of money."
2,"Bad, and an ironic title","Unreal is a bad movie. It starts out good, but gets really boring. Then you realize it's a mockumentary and the whole film goes down hill."
4,Easy to cart along and comfortable.,"These are great for the price and really comfortable. The only drawback is that they are really, really low to the ground and can be a bit of a pain to get in and out of. If you have back issues, do not buy these."
5,Perfect chair for beach,"This is my favorite product that I've seen all year. I bought one and LOVE it. Basically, it is a comfortable chair that is really portable and lightweight. You can take it anywhere...the backpack straps are easy to use and you can just throw it on your back--freeing up your hands to carry a cooler, toys, or anything else you might need for the park or the beach.Anyone going to the beach MUST have this. It's very comfortable and has proven quite durable for my use. You could sleep on the beach in this chair all day long.Hope you like it as much as I do--i think this may be the best deal online."
3,"Great design, but small.","I love the design and it fits my wife perfectly (5' 7""), but I thought it was too short fot my 6 foot body. It seemed like the head rest and top bar were at my shoulders and I had no support for my head. Both my wife and I thought that the chair should sit higher off the ground. It sits very low like a beach chair.Overall, I think the concept is excellent, but it felt to me like I was sitting in a childs chair. I'd pay twice the price for a large, tall, adult version."
4,Worth for Money,It is a great comfort when you are sitting in WearEver LR-4 Deluxe Backpack Lounger in bright sunshine in your balcony. You can stretch your legs and just sleep. Worth every penny.
3,"Great idea, lame execution","I busted my knee recently, and this lawn chair seemed like just the thing: it (1) has a built-in footrest, and (2) can be easily carried by someone on crutches. Sadly, though, the chair is uncomfortable to sit in for any length of time, and has a support bar that pokes me in the back in certain positions. It's OK for maybe a half-hour at a time -- I think the reviewer who said they could lounge all day in this chair has some advantage I lack (well-padded bum? better beer? compelling distractions?)."
3,wearever chair,"keep in mind this is a beach lounger. it is very low to the ground, hard to get out of ,maybe i should do more setups."
2,false advertising!,"I purchased these chairs soley because the description says 1"" rust resistant ALUMINUM frame. This chair is not aluminum, a magnet sticks right to it which means it's metal with a nice coating to make it look aluminum. I paid $73 each for 2 of these chairs when I could've saved $30 and bought through another supplier the same exact 'coated' frame chair.The chair is comfortable I do have to say after trying it out in the front yard but not sure how long it would last in the sun, surf and sand. Disappointed and hope to get my money back and have them pay for shipping to return."
5,"Charles Vess' ""Ballads"" is compelling and exquisite.","""Ballads"" is the trade paperback collection of Vess' four-issue ""Book of Ballads and Sagas"" comic book. Writers include Neil Gaiman, Charles deLint, Jane Yolen, and Sharyn Crumb. The stories are all based upon songs such as ""Twa Corbies,"" ""Barbara Allen,"" and ""Tam Lin."" They are all exceptionally well-written, and the illustrations are beautiful, sensitively drawn pen and ink work by one of today's finest proponents of fantasy art. Mr. Vess' work has been compared to Arthur Rackham's, and believe me, he certainly doesn't suffer by the comparison. This book will be loved and treasured not just by afficionados of fantasy, but also by fans of folk music, and by all those who appreciate truly fine artwork."
4,There's never enough Vess,"In this book, Vess has taken a number of classical and modern ballads, and filled in the visual story around them. The drawn narrative is a varied as the stories. Some pictures, like the whole-page birth scene, are entire stories in themselves. Not many people can put as much into black and white a Vess, as this book demonstrates.I wish I could give this book five stars, but this isn't the greatest presentation of his work. His best work has a very delicate line. Maybe it was just the printing process, but this book came through in a coarser style. His black and white work is outstanding, but I like his color work too - this book was not able to show any of Vess' skill as a colorist.These short stories fit nicely with Vess' renderings of operas and other long pieces. I recommend this book to anyone who already like his art. If you're a newcomer, though, other books give a better idea of why his work is so special."
4,Solid technology book that is not outdated when published,Many technology books are outdated by the time they are published. I am pleased to say that this book methodically moves through effective instruction and then how to use technology to aid it. I will be using this book as a reference for some time to come.
5,Bibliophilia,"If you like modern architecture in a historic context, impressive photography and bibliophilia is one of your addictions this book is a must-have. The quality of the pictures, the depicted objects and the book itself are at match to each other..."
4,Social Justice class textbook,This book is very heavy on theory and ideas behind social change which makes it a dense read. There are many new perspectives brought to light in this book however that make it worth your while.
5,A Story of Redemption,"Thomas Wingfold, Curate is a wonderful story of redemption and the honest search for a true and loving God. Wingfold enters the Curacy as a profession, but it soon becomes a passion as he is forced by his position in the church to truly struggle with his faith (or lack thereof). He discovers the amazing love and sacrifice offered by Jesus Christ, and he can do nothing but share the amazing life (and death) of Christ with his fellow parishiners. He nurses a young man who is wrought with the agony of having committed a murder to spiritual health and peace in knowing that when he dies soon, he will see Jesus. We are given a glimpse of the immense power of divine forgiveness to those who so desperately need it and seek it."
2,set of 10 fairy tales,"I found this book to be almost useless. Basically it is a set of ten puffed up pieces that look like they were written by company PR shops. You may as well read the ISO 9000-3 manuals.Little of the true agony of large software development showed. Having been involved in several large software efforts and in process improvement, I found the book to be very antiseptic and clean -- without any of the real messiness of real software development.Addtionally, the cases presented were slanted totally towards straight business and did not address anything related to embedded or real-time development practices. I was sorely disappointed in this book."
5,Relevant for the earth's changing energies,"I read this book under its previous title many years ago (in the eighties). When I reread it recently, I was amazed at how much of it points to events and energies on the planet that are pretty generally accepted today by those on a spiritual path. Andrew's struggle to overcome her ego and learn the power of essence are timeless themes, and the teaching has never been more needed in the world than it is now. Read it for the first time or read it again. It may make more sense if you read Medicine Woman first, but it is a better book than Medicine Woman and far more insightful."
1,Not suitable for a cold climate,"This door appears to be decently made. I thought I had made a good purchase; but in no time the flap had completely failed at the hinge line. The flap is not replaceable. This thing MIGHT (I say might) work in a warm climate, but when cold, the flap becomes rigid and breaks off at what should have been a flexible hinge line. I would definitely not purchase another for use in a climate where it gets cold enough to snow - - and maybe not anywhere. It's one of those products that make you wonder why manufacturers do this stuff."
2,Flap tore and isn't fixable,"After 6 months, the flap on the door tore off. Havahart tells me the flap is integral to the assembly of the door and is non-replaceable on this aluminum frame version. They've offered to replace the entire door with the plastic frame version and an extra flap.This door only deserves one star, but because the company has addressed the issue, I've given an extra star for customer service."
3,decent,"I like the metal frame- much better than a plastic one. The flap is already breaking though. It doesn't seal air tight AT ALL which is a waste of energy.Was moderately hard to put into the door, but I think that would be the same with any dog door.My dog took to it immediately and uses it quite happily now."
5,amp kit,"The amp kit had plenty of cable to wire my amp to sub, the thing that was a bit troubling was putting on the end terminals on the cables. the cables work great and deliver great sound and power to amp and sub,it comes with all the necessities that are needed to power an amp. This was a great product at a great price.very recommended"
3,Valuable yet disappointing to a hardcore Italian horror fan,"""Eaten Alive"" is valuable in the sense it will serve as a decent introduction to these films for the newcomer. Also, there are reviews of some very obscure films, the interviews are informative and the poster art is great. However, I find a lot of Mr. Slayter's likes and dislikes rather mind boggling. For example Slayter upholds Fulci's ""Conquest"" (a horrible Conan The Barbarian rip off) as a good film yet goes on at length as to how deplorable ""Cannibal Ferox"" is. Yes ""Ferox"" has it's bad points but it cannot be ignored that it is widely considered a cannibal classic (perhaps second only to the mighty ""Cannibal Holocaust."") Every horror / exploitation fan has differing opinions but I found Slayter's to be darn-near hypocritical. So I warn hardcore fans to either skip this book or be prepared to shake your head in disgust several times while reading it."
1,Would give it -5 if I could,"This phone is the worst cordless phone that I have ever owned. I love the cradle, size, and features and Panasonic is tops in the cordless phone biz. But if the caller cannot hear me and I cannot hear them, then I might as well be using Dixie cups tied together with string!"
4,Good compact and functional unit,"I've had this cordless phone system for three years now. It's a great unit to use for a smaller place (like my one-bed apartment) and works great with VOIP (I use Vonage, but I've used other carriers prior and it works just fine). I haven't had any problems with this unit. I have noticed that the buttons lose their paint fairly quickly, but other than that, great compact unit, good functionality, and good cordless range. Not recommended for larger homes or extended ranges."
1,nope,"now i know my phones. u could say i collect cordless phones. i am a panasonic lover. this phone is horrible. convieneint for two cradles but cant hear anything on it and they cant hear u. u r in tunnel alot of times while talkng. i just hate it. i just knew it had to be panasonic i got, i hate ge with a purple passion. ge could not make a dog tird if they had too. i wish toyota would make a phone,, haha. but panasonic is always best, but man someone was really loaded or somethign when making this particular phone. its horrible. what a waste of money."
5,superb and grossly underestimated,"one of my top 15 CDs, very well-written, raw and from the guts, finesse and brains, I can't understand why no one has bothered to write a review yet. Of course, Marques does not play the commercial & promotion game and wants to stay in his area of Madison, Wisc., and yet talent is talent. Gross injustice in the lack of recognition for these guys and their music."
3,No real page numbers.,"Book is fine, but lack of real page numbers can be a significant problem for students. I'm surprised the publisher didn't consider that!"
5,Great!,"This seller is awesome! The book came on time and it was brand new. I have no problems and no complaints. If you want to know more about the reproductive aspect and sex, this book is great!"
2,"Great Idea, Poorly Written","I was looking forward to reading this book, and very disappointed. This is the top book for reproductive physiology, and it's the best of what's out there. But what amazed me was that it can be the top seller and still be so poorly written.What exactly is it about the writing that is weak? The authors provide explanations for some terms/concepts that are incredibly basic (like what is a hormone). But when they get into to meat of the subject, they neglect to provide the ""big picture"" and instead start laying out the plumbing of girls and boys. My previous courswork in human physiology was the only thing that helped me figure out what they were trying to say.Nice graphics are actually a distractor, more eye candy and weakly tied to the text."
2,"Great quality, but incomplete","Only after buying this cd, I found how out a very significant portion of the show was taken out of this recording...why? I have no idea, but it kinda sucks.As far as the music itself, it's incredible, and the quality of sound was remastered, no complaints there. But I strongly reccomend buying the DVD (which has everything) instead of this."
2,Great music...bad disk,"This album was a fantastic collection of live music. Sound quality is great, song selection is better. One of my favorite of everthing he's put out. Unfortunately, it won't play in my car or on my computer at work(I think it's copy protected). Plan accordingly if you intend to purchase it. If you get lucky and it functions on all your equipment...great, otherwise save your receipt."
4,Very good live Nails,"The mega-hyped live NIN album seems to get widely mixed critical responses, but I believe it's a fine record and a nice compliment to the excellent DVD. Some of the older tracks such as ""Head Like A Hole"" and ""Gave Up"" actually surpass their studio versions. Especially ""Sin"", the album's highlight, which has even more menace than the original. Many tracks from the Fragile, particularly ""The Wretched"""" are superior to the album versions. However, many of The Fragile's more forgettable tunes take up time, and a few songs like ""Wish"" are ruined by a lack of clarity. The setlist has some nice touches with ""Suck"", and classics like ""Piggy"", ""March of the Pigs"", ""Closer"", ""Terrible Lie"" and Hurt"" are presented with a fresh energy. A damn good live outing."
5,"Get the 2-Disc Set Instead, Guys!","OK guys, I agree, this is an awesome concert. But don't buy it. Buy the Deluxe Edition with the bonus disc ""Still."" That's the only way to get ""Still,"" which is pretty much an album by itself. It contains all original material which you cannot obtain any other way, 4 softer versions of previously released NIN songs and FIVE SONGS YOU CANNOT GET ON ANY OTHER CD. So basically if you like NIN, you're going to want that disc, and if you get this version, you're going to have to either buy And All That Could Have Been twice or just not get ""Still"" at all. So in conclusion, get the Deluxe Edition instead."
1,Not What I Expected!,"Be warned that this book is only a list of publications about mortuary science. I didn't know that when I ordered it. I'd assumed that it was an actual mortuary science textbook that would be useful for fiction writing research. As it was not what I expected, I returned it."
1,Why would I buy this?,Why would I ever buy this book when I can't even look at at table of contents! Too bad I HAD to give this one star.
1,boring-for those who can't sleep,"This movie tells you nothing about the real story was supposed to be based on. no plot. no nothing! just a bunch of teens with their simple boring lifestyles that brings them all together to the cafeteriaNot to mention the last 10 minutes of the film, which half of them filled with piano playing.. and yes! The shower scene is best and awaking up scene of all! One boy went in the shower minutes before shooting, with his murder-mate joining him saying a dum sentence like ""I never kissed before.."" and then the two of them kissing for a few seconds.. that's it.I won't even mention the shooting scene which is the worst part.This is a boring movie. If you really interested in the columbine massacre - watch ""bowling to columbine"" which is much interesting, especially the part with Marilyn Manson!"
1,Insulting to everyone.,"Gus Van Sant's latest insult to the viewing public is a classic indie con job. It's a film, obviously inspired by the Columbine High School shootings, in which people walk around an anonymous high school all day long, going through their daily routines for an excruciating 70 minutes of celluloid before two kids dressed in camouflage clothing come in and shoot the place up. It is anti-climactic, pointless, fervently anti-Hollywood, and incredibly boring.But it uses long tracking shots, is technically adept, ""offers no answers"" and ""makes us think,"" uses bleak classical piano pieces for a soundtrack, has an obtuse name (stemming from the ""elephant in the living room"" phrase, that, in retrospect, really has nothing to do with the film at all), and begins and ends with artsy shots of the sky. So it's brilliant. Automatically. Don't you dare dissent, because you're wrong, and an idiot."
2,elephant,"To everyone who`s interested in the topic, you might be very disappointed after watching the movie, because the characters don`t touch you and their story doesn`t take you in and therefor not interest at all.But there is something else... you should rather go for ""Zero Day"" by Ben Coccio, which is a wonderfull, though shocking movie about the same massacre at Columbine High. It`s a low budget film, shot way before the Elephant that won three grand jury prizes, which somehow even manages to empathize with the executers. Carefully staged and directed, it takes us into their lives and seduces by their humor, directness, and humaneness of their condition and their single-mindedness. Zero Day points no finger and wisely leaves it to us to judge its characters."
1,Time lost can never be retrieved,"At best Elephant is bland and clinched, at worst gratuitously violent and disturbing.Gus Van Sant paints the human experience as a painful, monotonous, flavorless, waste of time. Maybe it is no coincidence then that sitting through Elephant is a painful, monotonous, flavorless, waste of time.I can honestly say that Elephant is the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of sitting though. Words can not describe how terrible this movie really is."
2,Sigh,"I'm just here to critique, so sorry, no premise or plot review.I'm very sick of these ""movie snobs"" who want to say that the average movie goers are looking to have emotions ""force fed"" and just blankly stare at the screen expecting everything to be played out for them. While most movies do this, and good ones do not, this movie did neither.No emotion was every really developed. Every single murder is bluntly unemotional, and the movie becomes as unemotional as the murders. But, this may be Van Sant's point: that acts of violence are pointless under the conditions in which they take place. But because Van Sant never discusses these conditions, the movie is pointless. It isn't perceptive or insightful, it just bears an unbiased witness. Which is confusing when Van Sant has the two killers share a naked, homosexual kiss in attempt to add emotion where there is none. This movie lacks emotion and ultimately becomes forgettable. 2 1/2 Stars."
5,Elephant - its about what you see...,"Elephant is a troubling, yet extraordinary story that depicts several parallel storylines in an Oregon High School that represents the calm before the storm. These parallel plots symbolize different social groups, beliefs, values, and notions that leading to a domino effect towards the disturbing ending of the film. These plots are carefully directed and meticulously placed together in order for the audience to shape their own perspective on the horrifying deeds of a few high school students. In the end, Elephant offers an excellent cinematic experience that coerces the audience to cognitively participate in order to receive the full cinematic experience."
1,A WASTE OF TIME,"This movie was a joke, a waste of 80 min. of my life. It was SO SLOW. Basically, it's the same few kids walking up and down halls with minimal action, until the end. Hmmm...interesting how it's a school day and only a handful of kids are to be seen in school. Unrealistic & stupid, it's a waste of time and money."
1,"No, people, you're reaching too much for this crap.","Simply put, because this does not deserve anything more than brevity, this is the biggest waste of money and time all year. I would rather have bashed myself in the face with a hammer for an hour and ten minutes than have ever experienced this boring, ridiculous attempt at poignancy. There is absolutely not one ounce of emotion in the entire film, even after kids start SHOOTING UP THE JOINT. No panicking. No nothing. Bam, boom, splatter. Not even interestingly presented. This is one long, droning crapheap that should never have received any of this praise. Don't waste your time."
2,Bowling With Gus,"A fairly tedious exercise of particularly contentious issues which deserves far more committed, engaged behaviour from its director, Van Sant. The unfolding of the pointless mayhem is told in interweaving, elegant hand held camera style, all very collegiate in concept, and, really, in intellectual content. Van sant falls for the old gag of content being held in contempt by form, or art for art's sake. Dangerous stuff when you play a nihilistic hand in dealing with nihilistic, adolescent behaviour. There simply isn't sufficient depth, no explanatory power in this cheap entertainment. Get the scene of the killer kids lounging in the bedroom. Blondey looks at his computer game which displays rear-view figures and takes them out in turn. Camera swings to rear view of actual conspirator buddy and lover, also from rear and displaying identical anonymity as the game: adage? it provides more answers than it raises questions. All too easy a swing here, Gus. Get real."
1,you can actually take a nap on this one.,"This movie is......Boring! Ok, we get the point it was like this columbine scenario thingy going on.But lemme tell you, when I'm watching a movie I want to see some action or something that makes you want to see the next part. Not this movie!ok we are introduced to the characters in this movie, but I felt more acquainted to their backs then anything. What was the point of the forever walking scenes? jeez man! I've fallen asleep and when I wake up they are still walking.This movie blows."
1,jason,i bought this movie and after watching it i realised that it was the worst movie i had ever seen. how it ever got a screen release i will never know.do not even consider viewing it or buying it. it is NOT a movie in any sense or form
1,c'est impossible,"I don't know if this was supposed to be thought provoking or deep but it comes off being disorganized, uninteresting and pretentious. By illustrating how tragedy can emerge rapidly from an otherwise mundane, lacklustre tedium, perhaps the viewer is supposed to see this as ""real life"", but it was more total crap and a waste of time. I tried twice to watch this film, thinking maybe my mood affected the first attempt too deeply, but no, watching this movie was incomprehensible and I found it impossible."
2,Too artsy,The movies tries to be an artsy movie and goes no where. It spends too much time following mundane characters around and doesnt give any background. A worthless movie.
2,Boy was I bored,"This movie tries to show us how something like the Columbine shooting happens unexpectedly when we are dealing with our daily routine. OK we get it. I just don't agree that the life of a high school student can be as boring as these characters in the movie. I'm sure the Columbine students who lost their lives, bullies or not, had a lot more to look forward in their future. They do not deserve to be represented like this."
2,Weak,"Not recommended.This movie didnt pull itself off. The only sub story with any sort of impact was Johns, as I feared for his father and brother. Every other substory was weak and just didnt work in my opinion.Its pretty obvious what the desired effect of scenes of clouds passing and relentless corridor walking was in aid of, but it made the characters and impact of the film weak weak weak in the final analysis.However, I knew when I searched this film up that some would love it, and sure enough alot do. So maybe its worth checking out."
1,awful,For 108 minutes nothing happens in this whole movie. Then bam the school shooting begins. I fast fowarded 99 percent of this film and watched til the end. Super boring and pointless. Don't waste your time watching this film because there's no substance to it what so ever.
3,nothing fantastic,"Certainly, there is a cinematic quality to this film that is intriguing. Van Sant has directed a unique film that does capture the subtleties of everyday life. For that, I applaud this film. The juxtaposition of violence and the mundane is well done.However, this film sorely lacks the reality of violence, the brutality. I never once accepted the killers, as they killed, as real, and I never accepted the way the victims reacted to the violence as real. That is where the film went horribly wrong, at the end. The violence and the reactions were just as mundane as the pre-violence segments of the film.There is a complexity to the execution violence that was lost. There is a complexity to people's reaction towards violence that was lost. It was most unfortunate.I nearly gave the film a two star rating.For what it's worth, I'm in Law Enforcement. I have seen a lot of violence, both on the part of adults and adolescents."
2,boring,"The movie was too real. It was empty, and though it may be creepy, it was also rather boring. The movie dragged on, and some scenes were just out of place. even worse, the same boring scenes were repeated a couple of times? The only interesting part was in the showers the day they were going to die. They admit that they have never been kissed, and kiss each other. It was heartbreaking. But there should have been more scenes like that. Instead it was emptyness. SO i give it two stars."
3,Torn...,"I don't know where I stand on this movie. I understand the use of the long, drawn out scenes, but I still just really hate them. If he had shortened those scenes some, I think the message would still have come across, I just think that 5 minutes of watching kids run in and out of frame was excessive.That aside, I did like the manner in which the movie was presented, in that all the kids were connected in a sense in that one day. All in all, had some of the scenes been cut down, I would have really enjoyed this film even more. I would have to say though that this one is definitely worth checking out."
1,An Awful Insult,"This is awful film and is an obvious cash in on the tragic events at Columbine.The film is very slow and doesn't create the right atmosphere for the unfolding events. In fact it seemed to create more empathy for the two school children that carried out the shootings, not the victims. The film failed to convey the emotions that the world had towards the Columbine shootings, let alone the emotions of the parents, children and the local community must have had.I urge you to not support this movie as it is an insult to those killed and their families, especially as there was no dedication of memory to the victims."
1,HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING!!,"I am really into the Columbine High School shootings. I've read, watched and heard anything that it remotely close to it. So naturally when I heard about ""Elephant"", I was very excited. I got the movie from the library, popped it in the DVD player and was disappointed after the first 10 minutes. You don't kow much about the characters except that one has a drunken father, one is a photographer, two are in love and three girls have eating disorders. The walking and the piano playing gets old fast. I was just yearning for the shootings to start so I can have something to watch. But when they finally do start, it's very unemotional. You hear a few screams and that's it. You would think that the students would be more upset if someone was shooting up the school. I have to admit the very end of the movie gave me chills because you don't know what happens. But other than that it was very stupid. This was a waste of my time. Don't buy this crap. It is not good."
1,Incredibly dissapointing and offensive.,"I went into this thinking that to make a movie about such a tragic event, the director must have had some great insight, i left wondering how anyone could possibly consider this worth making. The characters were shallow and were not at all believable, which makes the claim that this movie just shows reality without judging it laughable, and even if that were not the case, i don't buy the lack of a message being a message in itself nonsense. This is a case of someone who didn't have anything to say, and should have kept quiet."
2,Wasn't enough,"At only 80 minutes of movie, the one thing we didn't need were those drawn out walking and cloud scenes which just seemed pointless. I got so annoyed with it, I just started skipping those parts. Towards the beginning of the movie there is like a ten minute scene of just a kid walking. It's just pointless.But between all those long,drawn out, and pointless scenes is a good film...just not alot of it. Kind of like ordering a soda at the movies where what you really want is soda with some ice but instead it's alot of ice with some soda."
2,hmm.,"this movie pretty disjointed, and pretty uninteresting.the thing is, i liked the idea, but jesus, try to make it keep my attention for more than five minutes. yes, our lives are full of mundane activies, but that doesn't mean you have to show ten minutes of some guy walking down a hallway.i just wish that the director had fleshed it out a bit, made us feel something. it was pretty emotionless, and all i kept thinking was, 'just get to the point already!' and when it finally got the point, it was a properly DISSAPOINTING point.this film contains about five million loose ends that are never resolved, virtually no character development, and an incredibly piss-poor ending. it gets two stars, however, because it really did have potential, but somewhere along the line it got completely mangled."
1,why this movie isnt good.,"im sure its been said here already,but i will still say how i felt about this movie. First off gus van sant recent movies have sucked. this movie is just as boring and useless as ""gerry"". the scene here with the piano toke forever for nothing. yes this is real life, life is slower and boring but i dont need to see that in a movie. the point of a movie is to be entertained not bore. i wanted to care about the charecters but i didnt. to much time spend on shots of the sky for no f**king reason. dammit man i know your making an art film but its just to dam boring. i love indie movies but this was not one of them. the violence turns out to be pointless cause they dont show why these 2 kids did it. u see one of them getting picked on but thats it. anyway i hope gus vant sant goes back to making something more like ""goodwill hunting"" and not crap like this, ""gerry"" and the kurt cobain wannabe movie. LeE"
3,The terrible future nestled behind doors,"Gus van Saint surprised to many people with this singular picture that explores with crude realism the frivolity, hopeless and miscarriage existence of two teenagers who assume the world is like a video game when you can kill and win points. After a extremely slow introductory section that consummates three quarter parts of the film, we may realize how the troubled mind of these young murderers take over their ambitious plans.There is explicit violence and for many viewers may become unbearable. For many reasons that you and me are aware I would like you to watch in presence f your children for trying to avoid this movie might be regarded a cult movie like ""Natural born killers"" achieving a distorted pattern's behavior.Brutal and devastating, not for squeamish."
4,Love this movie.,"I love this movie. its pretty slow and intense, though, definitely not for everyone. If you like Homeroom, The Finals, Brick, etc, you'd probably like this one"
