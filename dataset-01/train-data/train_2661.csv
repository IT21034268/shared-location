5,great gift for elderly mother,my mom loved this in her youth and was so happy to receive this - it was in good condition and made a lovely gift for her
4,Great Night Light,"I bought this outlet for my toddler's bedroom when he switched from his crib to a bed. We didn't want him pulling a traditional night light out of the wall - so this was perfect. Just the right amount of light - not blinding, but enough to see where you're going. We had it installed by an electrician."
2,good insulation and grip but bulky,The pot holder transfers no heat which is good and is very non-slip which is also good. However it is bulky and stiff. grabbing a closed handle of a lid or stockpot is very difficult and I find myself going back to a towel.I'll use this for skillets or pot handles but not much else. For the price it isn't worth it.
3,"Great Overview, little applicable advice","This book was a quick and easy read, with great insight on some pretty creative financing ideas. Unfortunatley, there is little beef in regards to applying these ideas. The most difficult part about creative financing is getting the seller to buy into it. With lots of links to Bronchick's website, you kinda get the feeling your answers will come via one of his webinars and product packages ::wink wink::. despite this, I am glad I read it, and highly recommend it for the rookie who wants to learn more about real estate investing and lending. Bronchick breaks down alot of Lending ""Jargon"" and includes a very nice glossary and appendix. Seasoned investors will read this, stare blankly for 7 seconds and say ""Duuuuh!"" If there were half stars, I would give it 3&1/2 stars, But I dont think it gets a 4."
2,Can't say this is one of better real estate book,"I have reviewed many real estate books and unfortunately this is not one of the best. The book reads almost like a dictionary in that it defines concepts more than actually how to use them. I would argue that most of the information contained in the book could be found on the web. In addition, I find it hard to justify purchasing real estate for investment using alternative financing. While I like alternative financing strategies, if a deal does not work out using conventional financing, then you have to be extra careful that you are not overleveraging or being too optimistic with your projections."
2,Ok,Not quite as good as I thought it would be. Hopefully more people can get better use out of it than I could.
3,was good book for its time,Material doesn't really apply anymore but at the time it was purchased the book was educational.
5,When he stops the rest of the world catches up.,"Matt Matsuda's uncanny historical imagination has achieved something no modern historian, French or foreign has been able to do: an analysis not only of the key moments of France's modern history, but also their hold on the popular imagination. He seems to realise that there can't be peace this year"
2,Not true at all,"Although this book has excellent pictures in black and white and gives some good information, many of the storylines in the descriptions of the movie ARE NOT TRUE. For example, I quote, ""In response to the hypothetical question of what one should do upon finding someone's wallet, Edward suggests giving money to friends. LATER ON, Edward is caught by the police taking part in a break-in..."" Anyone who has seen this movie knows that Edward breaks into Jim's house BEFORE Mr. Boggs gives him the pep talk on right and wrong. Even the movies are presented in the wrong order. They present Batman Returns before Batman. Many other mistakes are made. If you are a huge fan of Tim Burton like I am, I suggest reading Tim Burton(Virgin Film) by Jim Smith and J Clive Matthews. That one gives much more and quite better im formation on the best director (in my opinion) EVER!!!"
4,Half way to the solution,"I have been between jobs for awhile now and have been using a few different books for insight on how to get back in the working field. Most of the books I read were all pretty basic with the same basic information in all of them. However the ""Job Search Solution"" actually had a lot of useful information that most of the other books didn't. Also the information in this book is very current, including some newer material that older book lack. This book was very useful to me but what eventually helped me find the job I am at today is [...]. [...] is not like other job site, it only has jobs from employer websites and has far more job listings than you would find on other sites. If you are having trouble getting into or back into the job market this book was very helpful for me. [...]"
2,Geared toward computer job seekers.,I am a teacher and my daughter is in car sales. We really didn't find this book helpful in our type of job search. More for big companies.
3,"Good book, but there are better options","This is a good book; it breaks down many fundamental steps in finding that great job, nailing the interview, and starting a career that will make you rich!! But how do you find those jobs? This book does not go into the great job search websites out there. I'm on my third job now and what I did differently to find this one was the website that I used to find it. In the past I had used monster.com and other popular websites that eventually lead me to dead end jobs. Then I discovered[...] uses jobs that you would find only from employer websites and has far more jobs than you would find on other boards. So you're not competing against thousands of job seekers and are just looking at the unadvertised jobs directly from an employer's website. I highly recommend it!"
5,Fantastic resource for the job seeker,"This is a very well written book, even for older people looking for a job. Highly recommended."
3,"This is a fine book, but this is better.","This book is alright, but if you really want to find a job I would go to [...] . It is a great place to find a job because it only has listings from employer websites. You will find far more jobs here than any other site. I really enjoyed using this website when I was looking for a job, and It worked for me very quickly. Seriously this site has a bunch of listings and I personally recommend everyone to go there.[...]"
3,Pretty good,"This book really helps me to get a grip on my job search. In this economy, I grab for every available source. One really great one I've found is [...]. I look here for jobs because it has jobs only from employer websites and far more jobs than you will find on other job boards. I'm much more comfortable in the economy after these resources."
4,"Good, but not the best",This book is great for the mindset required once you get the golden oppurtunity of an interview- but half the issue these days is actually GETTING the interview and finding a job that suits your own skill set and needs. That's why I prefer to use websites like [....] to look for jobs because it has jobs only from employer websites and far more jobs than you will find on other job boards. When you apply to jobs that are on employer websites you have a better chance of getting hired because (1) they are not advertised and employers are receiving fewer applications (2) employers think you are interested in them and went to their website investigating jobs and (3) you are going directly to the source for jobs instead of using a middleman.
4,"Great Record, still waiting for the ""Into the Unknown"" Cd...","Don't know why they don't like it, someone egg them on to reissue it!"
1,"It functions eternally, as your weight fluctuates","This is a nice scale, but it is very inaccurate. Weigh yourself once, and five minutes later, after weighing again, you'll find that your weight has either increased or decreased within a few pounds. You'll never weigh the same thing twice!"
1,Piece of Junk,"This scale lasted less than one year. Took a long time to display a weight, and more often just displayed Err. Maybe it did me a favor by dying.I've noticed that many products I've purchased at Target are either DOA or malfunction shortly after purchase. Are they selling second quality merchandise?"
1,Don't buy this scale!,"I just purchased this scale and it is not accurate. I have had a weight difference of over 5 lbs in a few minutes. If it was consistantly off 5 lbs, I might keep it and subtract that weight but it isn't even off by the same amount each time. My boyfriend tried it too and it does the same for him. I'm very dissapointed considering it cost almost 45 dollars after tax. I will return this tomorrow and buy a scale somewhere else."
1,Inconsistent readings,"I had high hopes for accuracy after reading other reviews, and Ilike the look and feel of this scale. But, it consistently showsa variance of 1 to 2 pounds withing a 5 to 10 minute period. I returned it."
3,to adjust accurate weight,"WE like the scale, but it consistently registers 5 pounds too heavy---can it be adjusted?"
2,Accurate???,"I have the basic model. I think it's 7000V-1812. Around $20. I bought it exactly 2 years ago. It's accurate if I put a 10 lb. weight on it, but the more weight the less accurate it seems to be. I can stand on it one minute, then the next minute, I'm a pound lighter. I don't like that."
1,Wildly inaccurate,"My husband and I each get a completely different weight every time we get on this scale, even when taken less than an hour apart. For example, between 5:00 and 9:00 last night, I weighed somewhere between 137 and 148 pounds. That's kind of a big difference, don't you think? I didn't eat that much for dinner! I'm going to return it."
1,Used Pentax film camera,"This particular camera, advertised as in perfect condition, has a very annoying long delay between pressing the button to take a picture and the actual opening of the shutter so I am very disappointed as the picture I get is not the one I tried to get because of that delay. It is a simpler model of a Pentax Zoom camera I'd had for years and loved (but which has suffered an unrepairable mishap) so even though this one was missing instructions, there was no problem in understanding how it worked. I'll use it until finishing up leftover rolls of film and then have to contemplate buying a brand new model."
1,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this camara prior to our family trip to Disney World in place of our bulky Canon SLR. We had a point-and-shoot Pentax years ago that was a great camara.What a disappointment. We basically ruined 4 rolls of film. Between the viewfinder being so far off the actual image as to make framing a shot next to impossible, the red-eye reduction that did not work and the auto-focus that wasn't, I would never purchase a Pentax again. My daughters' $30.00 point-and-shoot took better pictures."
3,nice idea...,"Its a nice concept, quite convenient to have the wood on a slate, saves on having to soak it for days before it sinks. Two thing though; one, the piece I got was not exactly very ""artistic"", I was expecting something a bit more like the picture, two, being on a slate means that there is little you can do with the piece except place it as it is on the slate.Although I will not be using this particular piece in the aquarium I was intending it for, I'm sure I will find another aquarium to use it in soon. I might buy more, its like a lottery, you never know what you might get!"
3,"very damp going on, short-acting","Really, this isn't a bad deodorant. I like its lack of fragrance and its not greasy--but feels like cold water going on. Its ingredient list is reassuring. I had high hopes for it to replace my Secret Unscented. But . . . it doesn't last very long and by the end of the day I need to reapply or smell more than I thought I had in years. And it's the middle of winter in NH where perspiring at all is a real challenge! I'll continue to use it but am currently ambivalent about buying it again."
5,My favorite twine holder,Was looking for a while for a good sturdy twine holder and found it with this one. Nice heavy weight with padded feet so it will not scratch my counters. Worth the money and has a built in cutter.
1,Who Is This Guy?,"A couple of okay songs if one includes the very schmaltzy ""Mr. Right"". Where is the guy who wrote, ""Let's go cruise the western coast of Florida, where there ain't no stoned out hippies maulin' me..."" or Blue Eagle, or The Spy, or ""Willie & Cool Breeze"" or ...you get the picture. There's not a song on this album that can hold a candle to anything on his two vinyl works. If somebody wants to make a little money, re-release that stuff and get it a little play on Americana. Don't know where you went to, Bat, but there's a loyal cadre who miss you. Mr. Right ain't the same guy."
4,Bat stays true to True Life,"Bat McGrath, whether in duo (with Don Potter) or in group (with Michael Bacon, Rob Galbraith & Don Potter) or as a solo artist, makes a statement that touches the sense of our real lives. In the same vein as John Prine, Dan Penn and Donnie Fritts, he tells a story that touches the heart, whether with humor, sadness or dismay, his message is universal in its appeal. His earlier recordings, whether doing originals or some of the fine work of Lee Clayton, conveys the challenge and absurdity faced by the common man. Thanks Bat for your continued good work, with other performers now in Nashville."
3,Bat come back,"Bat has moved on. Mr. Right is fine but it isn't the same Bat I listened to in the bar in Rochester, NY in 1976 and picked up the eight track from him between sets. The Blue Eagle is the best. Bring it back Bat. It's time is at hand for a rebirth."
1,Who is this guy?,"Bat McGrath became one of my heroes when he penned two vinyls of songs (Blue Eagle, The Spy) a few years back. They rival any of the best Americana singer/songwriters around, then or now (Clark, Goodman, Keen, Stewart, Buffett, Russell, et al). The best song on this CD (arguably, Mr. Right) couldn't touch the worst song on either of those works. Its encouraging to see that Bat is still around making music but this guy is not the same fellow. Particularly if he's defined this stuff as ""success"". Go to a used vinyl store, pick up the albums convert them to CD and send a copy to everyone you know. Preserve the real Bat McGrath."
5,"Cute, compact, cool","This little thing rocks! I was looking to buy a video camera, not expensive but not cheap either, when I happened upon this little cutie. The video is good, the sound is excellent, it is very lightweight, and it runs on two AA batteries! If you're like me, you don't like to wait 2-4 hours for the battery to charge...This thing is great! Only exception is that it looks as though it is cheaply made. Other than that, it is a great little camera. Oh, and make sure you get an sd card because the camera's memory only comes with about 13 seconds of recording for video. I carry my little camera around in my purse. It's that small!"
3,not satisfied,this item is very small which is not a problem however it is very light and looks very cheap. I had to return this item because there is no audio. It really looks like something you would give to a liitle child.
3,OK MINI CAMCORDER,"CAMERA LOOKS GOOD, EASY TO LEARN HOW TO USE. NO FLASH. WHEN MEDIA CARD IS USED TO RECORD MINI VIDEOS, YOU GET DROPOUTS. STILL PHOTOS ARE OK. HANDY LITTLE CAMERA, BUT WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY FOR A BETTER CAMCORDER."
1,Not a good digital video camera.,"I will never buy nothing from this seller again. the digital camara i bought in 2007 only last me 3 months, and took a good care of it. it a very cheap digital camara. dont waste your money buying this garbage camera.so dissapointed."
4,Made for a great birthday!,"My sister is an aspiring filmmaker and needed a camera. As I am stuck with limited income, this camera was perfect for the price range. You'll have to buy a memory card for this, which was kind of annoying, but they are reasonably priced. It's not a high dollar camera, and generally, you get what you pay for, but this lil cam works well enough considering it's her first digital camcorder. The projects are starting already. If you want a reasonably priced digi cam for small projects or home videos, this one is perfect!"
1,"Great movie, however...","I really like this film, which is why I ordered it. I was disappointed to find out, though, that although the product description says ""All Regions,"" it is NOT compatible with region 1. I had to put it in my laptop and change the region in order to watch this DVD, and while that is not too big of a problem, there are a limited number of times the region can be changed on a laptop, so if I need to change it back to region 1 and later want to watch the movie again and change it back to the region the DVD works on, I can only watch it two or three times ever and then it will be completely useless. Therefore I unfortunately have to give this product a one star rating, but it has nothing to do with the film itself, which is excellent."
1,Don't be deceived,This is NOT an all regions DVD. It's region 2. It says so right on the box! I tried it on 3 DVD players and my computer before I had the sense to check out the box.
2,Mis-labeled Disc for UFC 49,"This review is for the physical product itself and not the content. I received my copy and there were 2 copies of the UFC 50 disc inside, so I returned it. When I got the replacement it also had two discs with the UFC 50 label. Instead of sending it back this time, I put them in the player to check if it was just the label, and the first one is in fact the DVD for UFC 49 but was just mis-labeled. I guess there must be a batch of these that went out with the wrong label printed on the discs."
5,Surround mixes worth the price of admission,I found the new surround mixes to be a real ear-opener. All sorts of new sounds to draw you into an album you've listened to a hundred times before. A no-brainer purchase if you have a DVD-Audio player.
2,Wouldn't Buy Again,"I am a true medium size, 34 waist, 44 chest, I ordered three mediums and they were ridiculously large on the sides, couldn't wear them in the gym or in public for that matter. Instead of going through the hassle of sending them back I took them to my tailors and spent $20 to get them taken in on the sides, now they fit fine. Unless you want through that don't buy this product."
2,Pitbull Stringer Not Worth Buying,"Purchased Pitbull Gym Stringer,wore it only once and already it is so stretched out on the sides under arms that I'm too embarassed to wear it again.Paid for an overpriced rag."
1,useless,"Lukewarm doesn't cut it.. Controller says 45 watts, not near enough. Put my 3 year old Biddeford (85 watts) back on bed, slept warm.Wattage should be included in product description. Wasted money. Never again West Point Home."
2,I guess we were lucky!,"Our mattress pad failed after about two years, rather than only a few months like some of the reviews I've read. We initially thought the problem was the controller on one side (which turned itself off after only a few seconds), but after switching controllers it appears that the issue is with that side of the pad itself. I've submitted a support request to Perfect Fit Industries, so we'll see if they respond... The store we purchased it from no longer exists, so I certainly hope so! We were pleased with the product while it functioned."
1,Arrived broken,"One side heated up, once didn't. Also when I tried to put it on the bed, my finger poked right through the ""fabric"" on the side. I had borrowed one from a friend, same brand and it worked great. Huge quality difference between that one (I assume older) and the one I got.I really got attached to having my bed warm. I'm going to try another one, different brand but I don't have high hopes."
1,Never received the product,"It has been 6 weeks and I have no heated mattress, no refund and Amazon's only advice is to contact local authorities because it might have been stolen. Beth Bath Home customer service would not even respond to my direct e-mails. They only communicate when Amazon contacts them. They said the put in a claim to UPS but never told me anything about it."
2,"Nice while it worked, then the HELL began","When I first got this product I loved it. Unfortunately my unit failed and one of the controllers quit. I gave it 2 stars because while it worked I did like the warmth. Unfortunately, like the other reviewer wrote, the manufacturer will not even return my calls.This product is made by Perfect Fit Industries. I have been calling them and emailing them for a while now. They simply refuse to communicate with me. When I call I get an answering machine. When I email I get an automated reply. The net result is a complete blowoff.I guess that is one way to keep warranty costs down on a failure prone product.If you buy this product you are on your own. If it fails you are out of luck. If you don't belive me try calling their support number at 800-299-1378 and pretend you have a warranty claim. If they respond go ahead and buy it. They won't."
2,Heated Mattress Pad,I have used a heated mattress pad for at least 20 years. I buy a new one every couple of years. This is the first time I bought one that turns itself off and I don't like that.The other part of this product I am not happy with is the temp control unit itself. If it falls off the night stand the dial is so easily moved that the temp can change during the night to either too high or too low.
5,Does what it is supposed to do,"Easy. Turn on heat bed, turn down, sleep. Shut it off when you get up or it will shut itself off. Great for old drafty house, better than turning on the heat!"
2,great if it works,"I was pleased with this product while it worked, but the life span of one of the controllers was less than two years. I have never had a heating blanket or mattress pad that lasted such a short time. I checked the unit and the transformer is working and power is going to the mattress pad for a moment and then it shuts off. I opened it and there is nothing wrong with the switch, but is appears the circuit board inside that controls how long it stays on is malfunctioning. I would have much rather had a heated mattress pad that lasted a long time, than one that had a 10 hour shutoff. Another product with too many electronic features that limit it's life. Unfortunately, I don't have the receipt to even try to get warranty service."
3,Practical,"The book is simple to follow, and its principles practicable. I've been using its recommended exercises and seeing results.Bossman."
4,Personal Magnetism,I enjoyed how the book was written in easy to understand language and it gave enough examples for you to try the techniques in your daily life. I would read more of this authors books.
5,comfortable and strong,"These Olympic 2"" muscle clamps are very easy to use, stylish and durable. They fit tightly restricting the plates to move, which gives you a secure movement."
1,You don't get what is pictured,Cap barbell muscle clamps are awesome and work great except thats not what you get. I recieved cheap spring clamps. I sent an email explaining what I got and recieved two more spring clamps. If you want what is pictured don't bother.
3,Interesting movie,"This movie is interesting. It follows the book (Red Dragon) pretty close. The acting is not that great, and when compared to Red Dragon (the movie), its pretty bad lol. Worth a watch tho."
2,Unexplained Photos,"Had I seen this book in a store I wouldn't have gotten it primarily because I'm into dollhousing & am used to seeing excellent photography. The majority of the photographs in this book is very poor. There is a close up shot of a table with lots of clues on it but the photo is so blurry that you can't tell what most of the items are. Its a real shame too because they make cameras just for miniatures & those of you who are familiar with the quality photos in ""Miniature Collector"" & ""Dollhouse Miniatures"" magazines would recognize just how poor they are. Also because Mrs. Lee was very talented & it would have been a great pleasure to have seen her work photographed clearly.For the mystery minded, the book offers clues along with the bad photos but does not solve the mysteries.I would suggest that you go & look at it in a bookstore before you decide to buy it. You just might save yourself some money."
5,great book,very rare and interesting story of a female artist from the early 20th century. nice hard bound book good for display.
5,I learned so much from this book,"This book took my business, AUDIN Web Design, to new heights. Now anyone can just type in AUDIN Web Design in Google (or Yahoo and MSN, for that matter) and find me. This book allowed me to master Google, the juggernaut of search engines. If you cannot tame that tiger, you will not survive in the market place. My company, AUDIN Web Design, has helped many small business get ranked on Google. This is my bible. I carry it around wherever I go. I advise everyone to read this book before consulting a professional about your online search needs. You could get ripped off if you are not wise about your choice of Company. This book has given me such confidence with the Google juggernaut, that my company now offers a 100% money back guarantee policy. A lot of companies can't offer that because they don't know what they are doing. Read this book and get informed. It could save you lots of money, yes money, the stuff you work so hard for. The stuff makes the world go round."
5,Gotta Be Google,"At the moment the only real game worth playing is Google. No, I'm not a spokesperson for them but it is clear that if you're going to play you ought to play with the guys that own the ball. There is power in ""Building Your Business with Google for Dummies"". The best thing is that when you meet the Google criteria and succeed with them you can use the exact same business building blocks with any other resource. Brad Hill understands this and does a great job relaying his knowledge via the ""Dummies"" format. I'm beginning my second read-through. Thanks Brad.Larry J. Frieders, RPh[...]340 Marshall, Unit 100 ~ Aurora, IL 60506Tel 630-859-0333"
1,Business,I have not had time to fully review this book as yet. When I do read it I will gladly give a review.
1,No Good,The new version is a lot better--this one was hard to follow and really had a plot that was bad. I would not waste my money on it.
2,Sooooooo Disapointed,"Was really looking forward to seeing this movie, loved the book and loved the new version. Scott Glenn is one of my favorite actors, very underrated. But this movie put me to sleep. No where near as edgy as the newer version. If you watch this one, don't compare it to the remake."
2,Wimp on Fire,"I loved the book so was very disappointed by the movie. This reminded me of one of those aweful Chuck Norris movies, but with Scott Glen instead of Chuck.For me his character was nothing like how I imagined Creasy to be from the books. Apart from lacking the physique, Scott Glen totally lacked that menacing look, for which Creasy is so famed."
1,Macedonia: warlords and rebels in the Balkans,"The author tried to write about something that he does not understand. It is more than obvious that he does not have a basic knowledge on the region, history and the relationship between the ethnicities. Furthermore I knew him personally and I am surprise that he is trying to describe events that he did not attend. He was in Macedonia ONLY couple of times during the conflict and most of the events are work of his imagination. I challenge him to talk and debate publicly for the book. It i so sad that a publisher publishes a book full of lies without checking the facts."
5,Loved this book!,"This book was just so good. I read most all of Lisa Kleypas' books. I was so interested in Nick in Lady Sophia's Lover and was really glad to read his story. Lisa made him such a complicated, contradictory and likeable fellow and Charlotte was so sympathetic but no ninny either. I highly recommend this book and all of her books."
4,Solid 4 1/2 stars - Great story for Nick.,I always am excited for a story to come out about a secondary character and wait all year for the book to come out. Most of the time I have such high expectations that by the time I read it - I feel let down. Not this one! Nick Gentry's story was great and Lottie was the perfect female character to be written for him. I read the book in a 24 hour period not being able to put it down!!! I need to go back now and read the rest of Lisa's books since this was on the second. My first was Lady Sophia's Lover.
4,"Steamy, steamy, steamy!","Worth Any Price by Lisa Kleypas plunges into the sensual realm immediately, with the prologue, and continues for the entirety of the novel. The actual story begins with Nick Gentry searching for Charlotte, a missing girl who has run away from an impending marriage to the insane Lord Radnor. Gentry has been hired by Radnor to bring back his bride, but when Nick discovers Charlotte, he also discovers a need to possess her himself. Facing a dilemma without many tolerable solutions, Charlotte decides to accept Nick's marriage proposal because she can't deny the attraction, and she senses he alone would be able to protect her from Radnor. I liked this novel and thought it was well done; I enjoyed reading about Nick Gentry's transformation both with his identity and his guarded heart. My only warning to the reader - the sensuality is very steamy and not for the faint of heart!"
1,HORRIBLE,"Okay, this is one of the worst books i have read and its by a very good author. there is no plot to this story other than some really bored sex scenes. if you want a book that's steamy with a deep plot, emotional characters that will make you cry, try her earliest books. Now she seems to be writing solely for the purpose of selling some paper -- i'd burn this one."
5,Nick Gentry steams up the pages,I have been working my way through Lisa Kleypas and this is another winner. This novel is follow up to 'Someone to Watch over Me' and 'Lady Sophia's Lover'. Nick is Sophia's brother and he was hired to find Charlotte the runaway fiance. Charlotte requests that Nick not return her fiance but she will become his mistress or not...
5,One of the Best,"Someone rated this as mediocre. If this is mediocre I'd like to know what is great! This is a book I could not put down. It was a wonderful story with two people who are worth your attention. The writing, the plot, the sex...all excellent. Nick Gentry is a prize and Charlotte Howard is one woman who is worthy of him. I thought it was great."
3,Overall... an okay read,"I loved Nick from Lady Sophia's Lover, and couldn't pass this one up about him.I was glad to learn he wasn't sexually harrassed in the prison as a young boy, and I was glad he got his lover.I was just not caught up into this. I adore LK's works, many of it. This one just doesn't appeal to me. I can barely get through half of the book.And somehow, when the heroine decided to make love to her husband right after he tell her he have two hundred thousand dollars worth of saving, I feel the timing made it seemed rather as if she's interested in his riches rather than him. It was clearly described that she finally see him as a vulnerable man, but I just couldn't get pass on the 'savings' thing."
5,Worth Any Price,Great shape for a used book. Mostly the way I go when ordering books...used. Speedy delivery. Can't ask for much more!
2,Worst yet,"As a fan of LK (I've read all of her books), I have to say that this was the worst one yet. Lisa, if you're listening, go back to what made you such a good story teller in the first place. This book was uninteresting, and boring as heck. I almost couldn't finish it. I didn't care about either of the characters, as they were just silly and unbelievable. And why she even married Nick instead of Lord Westcliff was not very thought out and simply stupid. I couldn't believe anything about this story. I think from now on I'll pass by her books, instead of buying them without even reading the back cover! Save your money!"
1,Not much substance,"I was dissapointed with this one. Not much of a plot just numerous X-rated love scenes. No sexual tension, unique characters, or anything else that makes romance novels worth reading. Kleypas gives the lead characters semi-tragic pasts and lot's of relationship angst, but no personality."
1,"The book was a hit, (i hit my next door neighbor with it)","For one thing it was so boring! i was really looking forward to this book, its as if the characted from the previous book is a completely different nick. I also thought it would have been cool, that instead of going to a prostitute to help him get over being raped as a child, he could have had the heroinne help him out, but thats just me. i couldnt get past a few chapters the hero was such a jerk and a loser..."
3,Good but not sure Worth any Price,"Written well with a good plot I read the book in 24 hours and enjoyed it.Nick Gentry, a bow street runner and former criminal, takes a commission to find another mans runnaway fiance, Charlotte (Lottie) Howard but marries her instead. I found the action plot was more of background to the true storyline about trust and respect but it all seemed delivered in a passionless way.Although I liked it all I was not moved by it at all. This is my first book by Lisa Kleypas I might read the prequal to this book. Lady Sofia's Lover. All in all good action, so so suspense, very good sex scenes."
2,Not worth it,"I think this book starts ok. But round the middle the story loses all the thrill. Like there s not big moments at all and it turns really predictable, without any twist to the plot. I m sorry to say tris is the worse kleypas I have Ever read."
3,two people with dark pasts meet...,"Worth Any Price by Lisa Kleypas is set in the early Victorian era in England. A detective (a man with a truly tortured past) is hired to track down a runaway fiance for a wealthy (and quite insane) lord. When Nick Gentry finds Miss Charlotte Howard, he decides to marry the terrified girl himself rather than return her to the horrible man she fled. Many complications ensue, including interference from the spurned fiance and dealing with the dark secrets in both of their pasts, before the two can find happiness."
5,I just love a bad boy!!!!,My favorite in the series!!!. Another reformed bad boy and boy nobody does it like Lisa can. This book is in my top three. Worth any and all of your time.
4,Very enjoyable easy to read.,"I would not have called myself a reader in the past but since 50 shades of gray I can stop myself. A friend of my recommended Kleypas to me and Worth Any Price was the first of her titles for me. I think it might have been better if I would have read two of the other Bow Street books first, however having not read them to this point that may not be the case. This book had it all suspense, danger,and love. It was easy to follow and I believe much of it to be historically correct."
3,it was ok,i love kleypas this one was not one of my faves found guy too immature and throughout the book it was all about sex not a bad thing but i would of liked a little bit of a plot and all the hype that he was trained by a madame never delivered when he came to do the naughty same all same all
2,Disappointed in quality of results,"I have an SLR camera and was looking for P&S; for my parents. Not a happy user after spending $320, going to return this camera.Got average results, tried various indoor and outdoor lighting conditions as well as landscapes and portraits. As many folks have pointed out here, viewfinder is very small and awkward.I first thought that I was used to (better) SLR results and hence P&S; results might not have met my expectations but upon closer inspection, it was very obvious that while 200mm zoom is handy, quality of the pictures is really average. One can get similar results with much cheaper camereas.Also note that lowest setting on this is 48mm so it was very difficult to get a group picture with in an indoor setting with limited space.Would not recommend anyone to get this camera if you are looking for quality results."
5,Popular Camera,"I bought this camera after reading the comments about it on Amazon. Needless to say, now that I have it I am even more impressed. The zoom is fantastic. You have the option of having the date on your photo, you can adjust the viewer to your own eyesight - great if you have bad eyesight, and the LCD screen is great. It appears that a lot of people have the same view as I do - this camera was very hard to find in the local camera stores and Best-Buy, etc.. I'm glad I found one. This camera is perfect for those who want more flexibility than a regular old 35mm. All in all...a best buy!"
1,worst camera I've ever bought,"I purchased this camera just before leaving for Peru and the Galapagos Islands. 25% to 30% of my photos turned out. So I've spent nearly $... for developing bad photos. The rest are blurry. I've been taking photos for years, and I wanted a zoom lens on a reliable camera rather than taking my heavy SLR. WHat a mistake. I'm returning it for a refund. I've already contacted Pentax."
1,Don't do it,Major frustration with this piece of equipment... shot three rolls of film before I found out that the shutter wasn't opening... clear date though... lost vacation pictures... sent it back to Pentax for warranty repair months ago... seems as though it fell into a black hole... I won't buy another Pentax... out $400... had good luck with Olympus... maybe it's time to go back.
2,Frustrating,"This one is going back. The pictures are great yes, but the camera is annoying. For one thing, you cannot turn it on without 2 hands and even then, the flash pops out right into your fingers as you turn the dial. You may not think that is a big deal but do you really want to fumble around with the camera every time you turn it on?Also, the viewfinder is inexplicably murky and dark. Hard to see though. I had it at my daughter's soccer awards show in the auditorium of the school (you know, with that hideous yellowish lighting) and I simply could not see her through the viewfinder from about 30 feet.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the pictures are great and the zoom is the longest in the point and shoot class. But I think I can get pictures just as good without these frustrating elements of use. I am going to try the Olympus Stylus 140 which is $100 cheaper. I'll let you know how that one is...."
5,Frustrated camera user finds solace!,"I had previously owned an Olympus stylus 115, a Samsung 105 and was very disappointed with the picture results. This has been an answer to our dreams! The pictures are clear, and color is great! The zoom feature is awesome! Some of the portraits we have taken are super. I couldn't be more pleased. The price is high, but it is worth it for the dependable results!"
5,Breathtaking,"If there truely is 'beauty in simplicity' this is a film that encapsulates it perfectly. The cinematography is so sophistocated it belies the genius behind it. It is such a genuine piece of work that doesn't attempt to work emotions - they simply happen through the extraordinary portaryal of the seemingly ordinary.Anyone who teaches or has the slightest interest in children will, and I say 'will' without hestation, be drawn into into the lives of the pupils and will understand what lies behind the teacher we all wish we had.If you have the opportunity to see this film - do so. In an hour and a half you will understand the cheepness; the commercialisation of Hollywood and you will leave the film celebrating the art of documentary making at its very very best."
1,I don't get it.,"I just do not get what this was about. I am a documentary collector and love the genre, but this one has me scratching my head. How did it get such great reviews? Let me spell this out - it is a very, very dull film. I wouldn't even recommend watching it on a rainy Sunday, let alone buying it.All the way through I was wondering when the penny would drop and I would see what everyone was raving about. That never happened. And I bought this turkey. Oh well. Maybe someone will read this and won't get caught out like I was.Anyone with a video camera could produce identical results by going to any school on the planet tomorrow. Kids, sitting around, learning. Wow."
4,not as I remembered,"I was overwhelmed by this documentary when I first watched it so I only noticed the kindness of the teacher (which I have never experienced) and the cute children. Now that I own this film and rewatch it closely, I'm struck by the poverty in this farming community in Auvergne."
4,Collect [money amount],"I am no mystery lover. I think I overdosed on Nancy Drew when I was growing up and seeing as how I am not now nor ever was a blue-eyed titian haired rich girl, I wish Blanche had been around even then. I adore the respect of The Ancestors the author injects into each of the Blanche tales and the ease that she allows the story to unfold. It's as if the story writes itself. This was anything but predictable and formulaic. What held me is that throughout the book I often forgot there was something sinister going on. The author used the south as a backdrop and the attitudes and notions that are still very much alive today served as a captivating and thoughtful undercurrent. I think Blanche is here to stay."
3,I love Blanche,"Not a big mystery but I like being in Blanche's head, she's funny, honest, and real and sexy, too."
3,Blanche Passes Gp,I found the novel written about a black domestic from the South an interesting viewpoint. What I didn't like was the author complaining of the white racist attitude when she was guilty of a definite black racist attitude. I also didn't like the ending when the domestic failed to take responsibility for her part in the death of an innocent man's death.
4,I like Blanche,"This is my first time reading this author, but so far, I really like this series. Granted, I can't relate to being in touch with my Ancestors or being a black woman in the south, but I can relate to being a woman and feeling like you have to have a tough skin to survive. The lead character, Blanche, is realistic; flawed, humorous, accepts her physical body, tries to overcome her difficulties with strength and flexibility. I'll likely read another one in this series. Well done Barbara.Alexandrawww.alexandrapauley.ws"
5,Backstreet Boys Lost Video,Excellent product! This is an ideal item that anyone can buy with just a low price with honest guaranteed satisfactory.
5,"Mystical, and dream-like","This album portrays beauty, anguish, calm, and many other states of being. It has some of the qualities of New-Age yet has the emotion impact of classical. As well, it has a large jazz component. It isn't an all out ""chill-out"" disc, by any means. It contains some very foreboding moments, thanks to Jan Garbarek's wild playing on some tracks! It all shimmers with a vagueness though that is characteristic of a dream! I love this release for its range of emotion and emotional impact especially on the melancholy ""Cycle Song""!!"
5,Helps to fill your life with meaning,"I have often used this record in theatre-work, for concentration as well as relaxation, but most of all: inspiration. Some of the intensive, lyrical musical lines presented in Cycles make me want to cry every time I listen to them, they help opening my mind and also reassure me of a higher conception of life - a state safely beyond boring limits of ""understanding""."
4,Five stars for the cover,This album is quite a snoozer IMO. The main reason i still keep it (an LP) is a cover. It's very enigmatic and have that strange appeal.
5,completely satisfying,This is one of the most trustworthy works in the field of Patrology. Without doubt it would be an asset and a treasure to one who possess it. And the further research will be almost easier with this source which has kept a100% faitfulness to the original texts
2,Hypocrisy becomes moody - 2.5 stars,"Penetralia and Osculum Obscenum are two amazing albums. Once you pop in this disc, you might not recognize them. Keyboards start to become a major instrument in Hypocrisy on this album. Its not used on each song, but it is prevalent. I just cant get into this album as much as their previous albums. There are song good songs, but overall the album just was a disapointment for me.I honestly cant believe all the 5 star ratings this CD is getting. Imagine Hypocrisy (standard death metal) combining clean vocals and keyboards into their songs... sounds like Hypocrisy is reaching out to the Faggoths."
3,I prefer the latter stuff,"Im not a huge fan of hypocrisy,Its not that i dont like them its just not a band that appealed to me largely.I do own a couple of hypocrisy albums and a bunch of Various tracks(that i picked up on samplers and stuff)but i just find this album slightly boring.Ive never been a fan of slow doom/Death style metal and this album did very little to change my mind.The songs are too long and slow,The album drags and after about 20 minutes i was just wanting the track to end.Dont get me wrong i love my metal and if its doom/Death you are after It may well be a masterpiece,But if your new to this style of music proceed slowly and with a lot of patience."
3,Announcers view esoteric,If you want a very brief inside look at what the AWA was like after Hogan and Okerland left and the ultimate demise of the AWA then this is a good book for you. The author has no real insight into the glory years of the AWA but he does cover the waning years from his fill in standpoint. The author is very sincere in his writing however there are tons of better wrestling insider books out there. If you have run out of wrestling reading material then get this if not wait awhile
2,Only for the fan who reads EVERYTHING!,"I finally picked up this book and my expectations were met perfectly. That's because I didn't expect much. Nelson was never a top announcer in the biz and comes across as a guy who wasn't even allowed on the ""inside"", because he is wrong on so many accounts and names. Some of these may be editor's mistakes, but some are just plain stupid and unexplainable, since this guy should have known everything about his company. Claiming that Jerry Lawler beat NICK BOCKWINKEL to win the AWA title was just one big mistake that almost any fan should know...(Lawler beat Curt Hennig by the way). Nelson did not mention any of the last days of the AWA (including the laughable title reign of his buddy Larry Zbyszko). A few of the stories are entertaining, but with so much totally incorrect info and an overall lack of depth, only the fan who reads EVERY and ANYTHING about wrestling should buy this book."
1,Don't waste your time,"This was a very disappointing book. The stories start to blur after a while, because the topics are always the same -- drugs, booze, and women. There are numerous spelling errors and Nelson's recollection of matches, title swithces, etc. are frequently incorrect. I was hoping to get more stories on the wrestlers relating to their work. But, it was just one endless stream of after-hours tales. The book has a feel to it that it was rushed through writing and editing. Not worth the time to read."
3,Interesting??!!,"When I had purchased Stranglehold, I wanted to read it more to get a fix about the ""out of the ring"" goings-on in the AWA, which Larry certainly covered fairly well in this book. I had seen AWA wrestling from its ESPN days all the way to its ""death"". The only problem I have with it is that is seems very rushed, the stories don't go into great, great detail and the overall editing/publishing is pretty awful. Lots of errors. Larry would have been better off with having somebody write it for him as it seemed ""jumbled"", for lack of a better term, in paragraphs. But overall, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars since I am a wrestling junkie and this did cure a fix."
3,Stranglehold,"I was expecting something more when I ordered this book, since I knew Larry from his days as announcer with the AWA in Winnipeg in the 80s. The story of howhe came to be in the AWA was interesting, however, I found the gossip was completely irrelevant. It reminded me of a schoolboy who had so many secrets totell. For the most part, I'm glad he got his act together and is now happy. You could take tips from Larry's Adventures in Larryland. That's a book!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you're expecting a book that's half as insightful as Jerry Lawler's or Mick Foley's, look somewhere else. The author was a minor player in a second rate organization. The ""behind the scenes"" stories are weak and give you no new insight into the interesting people that made up the world of Professional Wrestling at the time. I've read many wrestling books and biographies and would recommend Mick Foley, Jerry Lawler and especially Pure Dynamite by Tom Billington. If someone gives you this book, give it back."
2,"Uneven, but generally not very funny","Andre Breton had selected the forty core texts for this anthology by 1936, but its publication was delayed by World War II until 1945.Virtually all of the authors were unfamiliar to me, and some are excruciatingly funny, but most are surrealists bogged down in Freudian concepts of the id, ego and superego.Neither Breton nor the translator, Mark Polizzotti, ever bothers to define Black Humor, but if they did, their definition would be Freudian and out-of-line with more modern views. Most of the pieces selected are, unfortunately, childish, unintelligible and boring.Life's short and there are a lot of great books to read. This is not one of them"
1,Doesn't do the job,"I've gone through a bottle of this stuff, and it does not kill crabgrass. At 2 tablespoons per gallon, all that will happen is that the crabgrass will begin to fade to partial yellow over a period of 3-4 days, but after a week, the crabgrass recovers and whatever affect that the spray had is soon forgotten. And yes, I went over the same crabgrass twice with the same concentration, 2 weeks apart. I ended up having to pull the crabgrass up by hand in order to kill it."
2,Yellow steaks,"We read the prior reviews and had good expectations. However, my husband sprayed our patches of crabgrass and within days, we had yellow streaks all over our yard due to the run off. Our yard looked horrible. It did kill the crab grass temporarily. It has now returned in the same places. Who knows?"
1,Toy Tiller,While easy to use this tiller is only effective on previously deeply tilled soil. It equates to sending a boy to do a man's work. Sorry.
3,Great for the pictures,"But of little use if you're a novice looking for more of a ""how-to"" guide with practical advice on what flowers, etc. to plant and when. It got to the point I hardly read the text by the end."
2,strange sub title.,"This book has a lot of photos: but they seem to have little variety.Perhaps it's the angle of the shots?The 'American' part is toward the end.Unfortunately, it is not possible to create an English cottage garden just anywhere (even in England):The book sub title is misleading about that.It is theoretically possible in some climate zones however, but the first requirement is deeply tilled and nourished 'old' soil, especially for perennials or biennials.The text is dense reading.Some people will love it."
2,Huge disappointment,This book is full of lovely photographs of English cottage gardens but I found it to be of no use to me as a gardener in the United States. The so-called layout plans are just rough sketches with no labeling of plants. The growing guidelines and plant lists are standard--nothing new there. I enjoyed looking at photos of Tasha Tudor's gardens but I think this book is a waste of money.
1,Will not teach you how to create a cottage garden,"Beautiful pictures, impenetrably dense text. I got this because of all the great reviews, but I have to disagree with them. I was expecting ""how to create a cottage garden,"" but this is more like ""two dozen cottage gardens and the two million plants that are in them."" It was information overload, and yet not very informative. I was very disappointed. I returned this and gotCOTTAGE GARDENS (LETTS GUIDES TO GARDEN DESIGN), which was much cheaper and much more what I was looking for."
5,A bounty of inspiration,"This is a truly wonderful and totally inspiring book. I bought it in order to look at the lovely photographs, but ended up reading it from cover to cover late into the night. I am completely new to gardening and have found so many books to be so dry as to be unreadable, not so this book. The main message of this book is just to start... LIke the gardeners profiled in the book learn from trial and error and move things around as necessary. The author describes a very personal, relaxed and process oriented approach to gardening which to me seems like the reason for doing it in the first place. Thank you Margaret Hensel."
5,Wonderful ideas,This books seems full of gardening ideas for those of us who are going to try to plant a cottage garden. We lost our home in the recent San Diego fires so this book should be great when we start from scratch.
1,Unreadable,"When I first started to read this book, I thought there was somethig wrong with me - I should be able to get rid of my pain. Then I realized there is something wrong with this book. This author's head is in the sand, unfortunately a common experience when seeking medical help.For me, this book depressed me; it didn't offer help or hope. As with so many other doctors or books, ""If only you..."" do this or that thing, or all of these things, you'll feel so much better. The onus is on the patient. Speaking as a patient who has devoted the last eight years of my life to my medical condition, all I can say is I had to put this book down; it was that depressing."
5,Built like a tank!,"I bought this when Amazon had it for under $100, what a deal!! This thing is freaking heavy duty.... weights as much as a small car!!(not really) lifts pretty good, lowers easily too. I have it sitting in my garage,.....makes swapping out the wheels off my 3 vehicles easy...especially with winter coming.The only bad thing...if i had to nit pic was moving the thing around and positioning under the car...it's heft makes it a bit cumbersome. I guess I was used to a nice small aluminum jack I used before purchasing this beast."
4,Not bad,"This thing is a beast of a floor jack, I felt sorry for the delivery guy having to lug it around.It's certainly well made with heavy gauge metal and seems to be very durable. Doesn't take much effort to raise the jack up, though I haven't tried it on the car yet. All in all, for the price it's a good, heavy duty jack"
4,Torin T83002 Model,Was on my way to Walmart to get a car jack. Went by TSC first and they had this jack on sale for 79.99. Great heavy jack that makes me feel safe while car is up (still use stands though). Only reason I did not give it a 5 star is I had trouble getting the air out. Had to do the steps about 6 times! Really was not that hard but was wondering after about 3 times if the jack was going to work. When it did start to work I was impressed with the hight it will go also. Old jack should have been trashed long ago.
5,High Quality,"I needed a high capacity floor jack to work on my wife's van. Saw the reviews and decided to give it a shot. Price was very good and with free shipping even better. Arrived in a couple days. The box was beat up but that is to be expected with a heavy item. Everything was there and no damage. This effortlessly lifts the van for easy maintenence. Very sturdy so I feel safe working under, of course jack stands are a must also! The old jack I used was a Sears 2 ton which still works but doesn't feel as durable as this one. I've had this for over a year and it works perfectly. I plan on ordering another one for when I have to rotate the tires."
4,"Wonderful Performance, Poor Videography...","...I hadn't had a chance to preview this performance, something I like to do before buying, but was quite pleased with what I got. The graphics look at least as old as they are, maybe older, but the music is incredible, in spite of the challenges of recording live in a cathedral in 1982. The Baroque style solos took the cake. I was accustomed to 20th century exaggerated vibrato (by less than professional soloists) that leaves you wondering about the actual key of the music being performed. I love this recording in spite of its age and criticisms... It's awesome to hear this kind of performance of a classical piece that speaks of the greatest Subject of all time and eternity. The Messiah!"
2,"Great performances, poor camera work AND poor audio","A few things to be aware of before buying this performance. This is a 1982 performance. My stupidity for looking at the 2005 notation and not realizing that it refers to the DVD release date. Also, and more importantly, the sound is Doly 2.0 (not 5.1). From an Audiophile standpoint, the sound quality is just not that good compared to other recordings. I also agree with the previous reviewer that the camera work is laughable. I've seen better video of my kids soccer games. I would recommend instead the Handel - Messiah / Cleobury, Dawson, Summers, Brandenburg Consort (1993)performance, which I also own and has better sound, choir, orchestra and camera work. I feel like I wasted $28."
2,"Dec 23, 2006 Total waste of 28.00","This was very disapointing, as we have seen really good performances of the Messiah, and this ain't one of them. If you read this and still buy it call me and I'll sell you some more junk. There is no excitment in the production, it should make you want to jump up and sing, it doesn't. sorry to our English friends at the Abbey."
5,Just like a night at the Savoy,"Ella Fitzgerald is a featured performer on this collection and she doesn't appear until cut number 4 (Sing Me A Swing Song). The first three songs are instrumental and really set the tone for what I imagine would be similar to an actual set list from a night's performance at the Savoy. Eventually Ella's reputation would overshadow Chick Webb and his orchestra. This makes the search for a recording of both good sound quality and an excellent representation of Chick Webb and his band while they were the headliners, difficult. There are many Ella Fitzgerald recordings so, if you want an album that defines Chick Webb and his band at their best - this is it!"
3,Star studded cast,"Chick Webb, drummer and band leader, is the headline persona of this compilation. Lots of tunes, a number of them standards, and some more original. Sometimes emphasizing the drumming and sometimes not. Therefore 3 stars.Co-musicians of Mr. Webb are Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Jordan. Chick Webb is to me known as the now forgotten competitor of Gene Krupa. For the afiniciados, Webb is the slightly better of the two. I would have liked more Webb and less of standards.Though, it is still a good record with some really delightful singing and occassionally an extra drum roll."
1,Broke after two weeks!!!,"We bought this about a month ago to replace the old wooden one we had, the middle part, what you hold onto, broke after about 2 weeks. We were surprised to see that marble could break like that. Don't recommend this."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the construction of this item. There isn't a hole drilled all the way through either side of the rollers. 1/2"" deep holes were drilled into either side and then the metal prongs fit into that. This means the metal prongs frequently pop out while you're using it. The holes aren't finished well. They're rough and I can see a crack stemming from one that will, with use, crack the marble all the way through. Very cheaply made. I really do not recommend buying this item."
2,Pizza no roll,"This product does not work, any pressure applied stops the roller. The wire frame is not strong enough to hold it's form. Nice idea, but not functional, Who tested this product before production, just another drawer filler."
3,should I buy it?,"I was really excited to discover a roller this size, but bummed about the mixed reviews. I'd never heard of marble rollers until a friend mentioned that's what she used. I'm going to be moving overseas soon, and really don't want to bring my big long wooden roller (which I rarely use currently)...but I anticipate making a lot more baked goods from scratch in the future...and would like a more compact/easy-to-clean design."
3,Childhood revisited,"I first saw ""While I Live"" on TV when I was a child and it made a lasting impression on me. Watching it now, 50 years later, I am not so impressed. It seems rather disjointed and confusing but it does have a certain period charm. I suspect that there are pieces missing, as Halliwell describes the film as being 85 minutes long, when it lasts only 57 minutes. This would account for the disjointed storyline! Now, as then, it is the music, ""The Dream of Olwen"", which makes the film."
1,While I live ---(-meanwhile I died),"The condition of the dvd was so bad that i gave up trying to watch after 5 minutes. This is a shame as this was a memorable film for buffs, but I could not bear the awful sounds emitting from the screen. The product was returned and repayment has been advised."
1,nasty,"Sound and picture quality is rubbish. Looks like it was very poorly recorded from a television broadcast, and the film wasn't in good shape to start with. A huge chunk of the story is missing from the middle which makes nonsense of the plot and there seen to be smaller cuts where there have been commercial breaks and the video wasn't cued to start on time. Possibly there are also cut(s) where the original film had been broken and respliced--for example, theme music at start is disjointed. Hard to tell from this travesty if the original movie was any good or not.Going from IMDb info on film length ALMOST ONE THIRD OF THE FILM IS MISSING."
3,Poor reproduction of a great film,"While I Live is a haunting drama of yesteryear that only British actors do so splendidly. The story is rather good and holds one's attention, but, of course, the finest thing about the film is the magnificent, beautiful tonal music by Charles Williams, ""The Dream of Olwyn"". It is a great loss to cinema buffs that such wonderful old films are not easily available in quality (and complete) reproductions."
4,Short but helpful! Simple but beautiful!,"I strongly agree with the first reviewer Betty Garrett that this is a good resource for new believers and a good gift to new church members. It is not as sophisticated as ""Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life by Donald Whitney"" nor ""Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster"". However, it is for sure adequate and sufficient to serve its purpose well. An easy and interesting read! A good Christian book of the ""Introductory to Intermediate"" level, for sure."
5,An inspiring story of an important and unique American.,"I have been reading biographies of the founding fathers from Washington to Madison. I picked up this book knowing that Adams was the one that I, and most people, know the least about. Ferling brings this man to life to the point that I felt that I knew him personally more than any of the other bios I've read so far. I was amazed at how attached I became to this intense and profoundly intelligent person who is regrettably most remembered as a vain and awkward curmudgeon. Ferling's story is complete, covering the varied facets of Adams as farmer, lawyer, philosopher, negotiator, statesman, friend, husband and father. If John Adams is more of a mystery to you than the much celebrated likes of Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and Madison, then this is the book for you."
4,John Adams,"As Richard Brookshire put it in his biography of Alexander Hamilton, it's really hard not to like John Adams. Ferling paints a great picture of why it's so hard not to like him. Adams was arrogant, brash, hot headed, aristocratic, etc. These are traits of our second president Ferling doesn't dance around. But on the other hand, Adams was also what we should all be, brutally honest, outgoing in spirit, unwavering in his beliefs,and probably the biggest thing I didn't know about Adams, madly and hopelessly in love with his wife and completely devoted to his family until his very last breath. Ferling doesn't kill us with unnecessary detail as is so common in historical biographies of the founding fathers. As Adams did, Ferling lays it out, and lets us be the judge. He states Adams' position on countless issues, right or wrong, and then allows the reader to pass the judgement. A fine work. Thank you Mr. Ferling."
1,15 minutes of fame,"Can't imagine anyone writing a book that would make themselves look so small, mean and petty. Openly jealous of just about everyone, he even calls his mother's book about her bipolar problems ""self-serving."" The perfect guest for Maury Pauvich, his anticdotes sound like someone willing to do and say anything for his 15 minutes of fame, unmindful or unaware of how embarrassed he should be over what he airs in public. It certainly does explain and illuminate his comments on the extended dvds.The thing that bothered me most was his proclivity to say what a jerk someone was, then to backpedal and effectively say how he meant that in the nicest possible way. He's the living breathing embodiment of Toohey."
1,Whining hobbit,I thought this book would tell me inside thing about the making of the Lord Of the Rings. Mr. Astin spends most of his time dissing everyone. Of course he tell us how much he likes them first.
1,Not Even One Star,"I love Sean Astin's work in the lord of the rings trilogy however I felt that he was truly being too disrespectful in his telling of the events that came to be the lord of the rings films. He is not a director and he does not appear to be an appropriate director anyhow, because of the simple fact that he is not a kind man, his thoughts that he has expressed in this book are very 'stuck up' so to speak and I do not respect that. The world does not sit upon Sean Astin's head, there is more to life than that. I love Sean as an actor, dearly, but when I read this book I felt that Sean was not really suitable for the lotr environment. I can easily gather the facts, he was always working with people who probably worshiped him. How awful is that. For any lord of the ring fan this work is not for you."
1,"There and Back again, By Sean Astin","I did enjoy Sean Astin in all three if these movies, I wish I had paid attention to the reviews before I bought the book.I was not happy about his remarks {negative} about his castmates,then giving back handed compliments to try to ""make nice"" with them.He is just too impressed with himself to be a good author."
1,A waste of trees and money,"After reading this boorish piece of tripe, I'm on my way to donate it to my local library so that no one else will have to waste their money on it. I really wish anyone else on the LOTR cast had written this book. Astin's point of view is self-indulgent, self-serving, long-winded and sucks the fun out of the experience. Astin is obviously an underachieved actor/director who knows it and is taking it out on his colleagues and readers. If you're interested in the behind the scenes work on the LOTR films, do yourself a favor and watch the bonus material on the extended versions of the DVDs. It's infinitely more interesting and you don't have to wade through all the blathering of a pathetic, jealous actor."
2,It WASN'T About Lord of the Rings?,"For those of you who give posters a hard time about expecting the book to be about the making of LOTR, let me ask you this - why did he steal Tolkien's title and why is Sam Gamgee's picture on the front of the book? Could it have been to hook the LOTRs fan? How many would have bought a book with plain ole Sean on the cover and a title such as "" The Sean Astin Story?"" That said, I found the book to be one big WHINE fest. He came across as a big, pompous bore...poor little fella! Crying about making such a paltry amount of money for repeating someone else's dialogue, wearing someone else's costumes and performing in front of someone else's sets. You're a parrot, bud - that's your gift. Actors! Sheesh! When will they realize they are not God's gift to humanity?"
2,NOT A STAR,I bought this book thinking it would be an interesting read about the making of the Lord of the Rings. Instead it is the story of how great and underappreciated Sean Astin is as an actor. To be honest who ever really knew of him before Lord of the Rings. I found the book a big dissappointment. I don't really care about how great an actor or filmmaker Sean Astin thinks he is nor am I interested in his political views. If this was his objective he should have chosen a different title instead of scamming people into buying his book.
2,Tedious airing of insecurities,"If you like Sean Astin do him a kindness and avoid this collection of naval gazing insecurities, petty jealousies and nit picking criticism of others. It will destroy any affection you may have held for him. The man is a complete drama queen and a bundle of nail biting insecurities. You will learn some interesting background stories on the production but not near as many as we should because Astin stuffs the book with boring anticdotes that speak to personal slights or inflated accomplishments. I bought this audio book years ago and decided to listen again in anticipation of The Hobbit. But I forgot how much I hated it and want to warn off any new buyers."
3,Where and back again,"I like Sean Astin and think he deserved an Oscar for his portrayal of Samwise Gamgee, but the boy cannot write. This book is unreadable and certainly doesn't serve Astin well, as he seems to bounce between being a complete suck-up and a complete boor. His habit of saying harsh things about people and then fawningly backpedaling from them wears on the reader after awhile. I have never been a fan of undisciplined stream of consciousness writing. The book is a self-indulgent mess crying for a sharp-penned and critical editor."
1,Perhaps The Worst Book Ever Written,"By far this is the worst book I have ever tried to read. I wanted to write a long review of how truly horrid this screed is, but the langid prose, the self-important boorishness, the idiotic self-centered nihilism of the monstrosity has sapped all of the energy right out of me."
4,Very human,"I find it quiet curious that a lot of reviewers blame Sean that he in in this biographical book telling about his life ?!?Isn't that what biographies are ment to ?I personally found the first half of the book somewhat boring, but necessary to understand the second half, which is quiet interesting.The book gave me a much better understanding how an actor like Sean feeled while doing the movie.He is not a superstar but an ordinary human being, searching for attention, being liked and being loved.If you want to read about superheros, better buy a comic book.If you are interested in a person writing about the search for himself and you happen to be interested in the Lord of the Rings movies, you are on the right place.Only 4 stars because of the somewhat boring start and the sometimes unstructured, difficult to follow way the story is told."
2,After all...a little sad,"Well, I had fairly high hopes for this little tome when I started reading it, but it didn't take long for them to be dashed. Other reviews here have pretty much summed it up: a surprisingly bitter and angry diatribe from a modestly (but not modest) successful youngish actor who should feel more at peace with his life and his career. I am a bit shocked that he has chosen to take nips out of the very hands that have handed him a bit more visibility. Big hit films rarely make big stars out of every one in the cast. Sorry, Sean, that Orlando got all the press. Life sucks.Given the title of the book, I was looking for the bulk of it to be about the process of making these extraordinary films. Alas, it's not the case, and I can think of several other actors it would be more fun to hear whine about their lives. I'm going to re-read LOR and rent Rudy. It will make me feel better."
5,My sister loved it!,"I bought this book for my sister (who is possibly the biggest LOTR fan ever) and she loved it! Fabulous book, very well done."
2,That is not to say....,"If all the ""However"" and ""That is not to say that"" were deleted, the volume could have been 10 pages shorter. The book is interesting but not brillantly edited.I don't find Sean Austin to be particularly self-indulgent, but I do get the feeling that he is in a constant state of frustration. He's a wonderful actor and, from all accounts, a fine producer/director. While reading this book, however, I had the feeling that Gollum was ghost writing for the author."
2,Tedious,"My one overall impression is that Astin is a man who needs to get over himself. Honestly, I was interested in what he had to say about the film industry and in making ""The Lord of the Rings"" but... I sincerely got tired of him patting himself on the back for every idea he suggested to Peter Jackson that was accepted, and even more tired of the sniveling that followed a rejected idea. Imagine having the opportunity to work with a cast and crew of amazing people and then finding endless things to complain about."
3,Less Than Expected,"Being a big LOTR fan, I bought There and Back Again hoping for some insight into what went behind the scenes in making the trilogy. Although indeed some insight is given, most of the book is a semi-autobiography of Sean Astin and focuses mostly on his personal lack of self-confidence in various scenarios in his life. That being said, I think his portrayal of Sam Gamgee in the films was outstanding and I could never imagine anyone else in the role.The book on the whole was quite disappointing and not quite what I was expecting."
3,An honest look inside the heart,"This is a brutally honest, very personal look into the life of Sean Astin. The first half of the book is primarily about his life before he played Sam Gamgee and the second half dealing with his life and experiences while filming that story. The best part is that he knows the truth about Frodo and Sam's relationship. He is very clear about what it is and what it isn't. Thank you, Sean, for that! I liked learning more about Elijah Wood also."
3,review of there and back again,I haven't had a chance to read this yet I'm just tired of getting reminders that I need to review it.
4,Seem pretty good,"I haven't used them out on a hunt yet and season just ended. They seem nice, I wish there was more string to tie up the bag so it is quieter. You can get it to work but another 4 inches would have really helped."
5,An Amazing Concept That Works,"Fifteen artists each tackling a legendary number by Kraftwerk, with a re-tooled twist. They are using old-school 8-bit video game systems and lo-bit microchip computers to bring a new generation of sound & vision to the music.This phenominal CD finds the songs merging into one fascinating presentation of cutting-edge performance art. Oliver Wittchow and Herbert Weixelbaum capture classic club beats, respectively, in Kristallo & Tanzmusik, while Covox brings even more desperation/sadness to the lyrics of Computer Love.The most ambitious number is gwEm and Counter Reset's interpretation of The Man-Machine (Die Mensch-Maschine), which is the fitting final piece to this innovative project.You do not have to be a fan of Kraftwerk to appreciate the new versions of these songs. This is as much a tribute to stretching the boundaries of art as it is to one of the most influential bands ever."
5,"All the Awesome of Kraftwerk, Re-Awesomed!","Kraftwerk: sweet. 8-bit: awesome. 8-bit operators: amazingly awesome sweet! Cool, nostalgic, original remakes of the kraftwerk songs we all love, some even better in my opinion (spacelab, antennae)! A few lack in awesomeness but are funny instead (man machine), i would call this a great album for any fans of kraftwerk, chiptunes, astralwerks, proto-techno, or electro in general!"
3,Zelda-werk,"Amazingly, these remixes sound exactly the way you think they would -- like the Mario Brothers and Kraftwerk did a project together. I like these versions until the re-mixer starts to sing. I think this would have been much better as a music-only project, but no one asked me. I give 5 stars to the hard bit-crushed music tracks between the vocals."
1,"Does not measure up, sorry.","Do not be fooled by the immitation ""greatest hits"" song list. The actual songs by Kraftwerk sound much differnt. If you buy this CD, it should be because of its originality, not its likeness to Kraftwerk."
1,Not worth the expense,"As reported by several others, the photos are dreadful.There is nothing here that you cannot get in better quality from google images or from a good MAME (Multi Arcade Machine Emulator) frontend.I chose to return the book."
1,Not good.,"The picture quality is horrendous throughout, apparently just scanned from old magazines. The pics are superimposed on bland white backrounds which, as there's little text, makes for an unbelievably amateurish looking endevour.I just have to return this one."
2,Skimming the surface - but a good introduction,"I read this book after reading a number of books on simple living, particularly from a Christian perspective, and perhaps that's why I found it less compelling than the other reviewers. I really felt that this book only skimmed the surface of the value of simplicity, so for me, was not a helpful resource at all. I became annoyed at the way the author endlessly quotes brand names (did he get commissions from Best Buy stores?) and relied heavily on a theology of a highly interventionist God.It's easy reading thouh, almost like a sermon series, and if you are caught in a busy, materialist lifestyle it would be helpful, and fun to read. However, if, like me, you are already living simply and are looking for something to give you further inspiration, this is probably not the book for you,"
1,Living with God,"I'm all for simplicity and living with less so that's why I picked up a copy of this book at the library. I was really, really disappointed to find that this was a book about living simply but with God. If I wanted a sermon, I'd go to church. If you're looking for a book about simplicity or looking to scale back I recommend Frugal Living for Dummies, The Everything Budgeting Book, Living the Simple Life or The Joy of Simple Living."
2,HOHUM,I'M JUST NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT THIS THING. DOESN'T QUITE FIT RIGHT OR LOOK RIGHT...AT LEAST I ONLY PAID 5 BUCKS...
5,EXCELLENT,had a hard time finding this and was extremly happy when I did and the way it came. Will Buy again
2,"Barrie Konicov's Fraudulent ""Money Back"" Offer","Barrie Konicov makes a promise that his self-help audio tapes are ""guaranteed to work OR YOUR MONEY BACK."" I purchased four tapes and listened to them for the recommended time frame. I found them to be unhelpful so I returned them to IMPACT publishing. However I did not receive the promised financial compensation. Instead, IMPACT publishing took my tapes!"
1,Huge fan of Atkinson - can't believe he made such a lame show!,"My whole family is a huge fan of Atkinson - which is nice because his comedy has been the one thing everyone loves. Mr. Bean, Blackadder, and some other various things he's done have provided great amusement. I bought The Thin Blue Line based on the great reviews here, but it's absolutely terrible. We watched the first few episodes and they were painful. Thinking maybe the series got better over time, we skipped along to a later episode - again, nothing funny at all. I can't believe Atkinson took part in such a pathetic show. The laugh track makes it even more annoying."
2,Say What?,"Don't get me wrong, I love the comic genius of Rowan Atkinson. I adore Mr. Bean and especially Blackadder, but I just didn't get this one. As an American viewer I had great difficulty deciphering the meaning of lines hidden in thick British accents and behind British slang. I know that Americans and Brits supposedly speak the same language, but for this one I think I need a British to American dictionary. (Do they make those? If not, they should.)I suppose this could very well be an excellent comedy the same caliber as Blackadder, but my attention span is too short and I'm too darn lazy to try to translate it into something comprehensible."
5,Bean grows up,I have always enjoyed Mr Bean in all his incarnations.The Thin Blue line is yet another example of his many talents.Excellent british humor from the entire cast as well.
5,Absolutely fabulously funny,"Rowan Atkinson's shining performance in this BBC series which I am so pleased to finally see broadcast on BBC-America is enormously funny and really quite original--it is easily the best thing to come along on this network since I discovered Father Ted in 2001. The gay Sgt. Goody is a highlight, as is East Indian Constable Maggie Habib, who has some of the show's best lines. Detective Grim provides an earthy contrast to Atkinson's zany brand of British pomposity, whose demeanor and facial expressions are priceless--but it is the marvelous writing which turns the characters of The Thin Blue Line into genuinely likable characters whose on-screen chemistry jells from the git-go."
5,Exceedingly Funny British TV Comedy,This is a superbly written comedy series. Each main character is well-developed. They've included the principal stereotypes in British society. It's a shame that this series only lasted two years. We've bought a couple of these DVD's as gifts. Rowan Atkinson is excellent as are the other actors.
5,At Last!,"I am sooo thrilled this is coming out in DVD. This series is side splitting funny. If you hated Mr. Bean (I love him, but many don't), Rowan Atkinson's character in Thin Blue Line is nothing like his character in Mr. Bean. Any fan of British comedy must add this to their list of must-see DVD. I have the VHS, but no longer have a VHS player. Can't wait to get the DVD so I can watch the whole gang again."
5,Best of the best British sitcoms,"I love this sitcom. It is one of the funniest shows from Britain or America. I just wish they had made more episodes. My favorite characters are Inspector Fowler (Rowan Atkinson)and Constable Goody (James Dreyfus). Atkinson's use of the English language for humor is exceptional. Drefus has the funniest expressions and mannerisms. I have never seen him in any other British comedies, but hopefully I will."
5,Another excellent Ben Elton offering.,"Saturday, January 01, 2005 / 5 of 5 / Another excellent Ben Elton offering.Received this box set DVD for Christmas and it's another fine offering from the creative mind of Ben Elton. An ensemble character study of a small town police force ruled over by puffy, stuffy Rowan Atkinson. While his sneering Black Adder venom is considerably lowered, he still delivers his lines with his trademark resignation of the clods surrounding him. What a crew they are, strangely endearing, particularly my favorite, the manic Inspector Grim, who always appears to be on the cusp of the big sting. Both seasons are presented along w/ a third disc detailing Elton's career which was fun to see w/ Young Ones, Filthy Rich, Black Adder, and beyond. Recommended."
4,Great Rowan Atkinson,"This is a fun series. Atkinson (as Inspector Fowler) is the head of the uniformed division at a small police station. His crew consists of a goofy chocholic, a rather outspoken female officer, a Jamaican officer who speaks perhaps too much, and Atkinson's girlfriend, also an officer.Fowler is fiercely for the Queen, against injustice, and pretty much a well meaning but quiet fool.Fowler is blindly naive to the needs of his girlfriend.Atkinson is joined by a cast of plainclothes officers who are goofier than anyone could believe. Fowler's plainclothes counterpart has one of the best jibberish lines you've ever seen and worth listening to over and over.If you like Mr. Bean, you will like this series. If you like Rowan Atkinson, you will like this. If you like British comedy, you will like this"
5,Rowan Atkinson has me in stitches again.,"An excellent ensemble round out this programme. Habib, Goody, Sgt. Darling, uh uh Dawkins and the sarcastic centerpiece Inspector Fowler. Atkinson's own special brand of sarcasm is here in good measure, although with not quite as hard an edge as in the Blackadder series. I had never heard of this and bought when I saw the positive responses. It is now among my favorites. I don't really see how anyone who liked Mr Bean and Blackadder would not like this dvd set. Buy it and enjoy and remember if my rear end is on the line, I don't want to be up to my neck in it."
2,Proofreader needed... ...,"Too many typos mar the information in this book, making me wonder how accurate the information actually IS---and that is if you can find points in the book where the author is willing to take a stand and give his opinion. I'm an experienced eBay seller with over 1500 transactions to date and was expecting some nitty gritty to help me expand and grow my business. Instead I was faced with ""try it and see"" at every turn....the author seems a bit shy of giving concrete information and instead takes the easy way out. There are far better eBay books on the market...The Dummies series is a great place to start."
2,A waste of money and time,"This book is neither a good book on selling over eBay not a good book on setting up a company. Trying to be ""all things"" to all people, it comes out as very superficial and almost anecdotal. Don't let the pagecount fool you: the 548 pages, with better layout (almost half of each page is white space) could be cut down to 200 or so, without much information being missed. And then, there's the dubious use of the information left. Having read the more technical ""eBay Hacks"" at the same time, though not focused on the business side of things, I found it to be a lot more useful. If you're looking to set up an eBay shop, go to eBay and read about it, and save yourself $17.47 in the process!"
4,a good value,This book is 500 pages of rich information that is helping make me rich. A real value for the price too! I've read a few books about e-bay but this is the only one that gets to the point and gives you the information you need. Concise and generous. I hate to sound like a comercial but it's the only book you'll ever need on the subject.
5,Not for Dummies!!!!!!!!!,This is THE guide to starting a business on e-bay! This is eBay for Smarties!
3,No science,"Dinnerstein argues from a feminist and Freudian perspective that if men accepted more child-rearing responsibilities, a host of modern ills including criminality and war would be significantly reduced. However, she stays firmly in the world of the theoretical and never tests her hypothesis. She doesn't investigate families in which children were brought up by both parents, or primarily by their fathers, so as to compare them with children brought up primarily by their mothers. How might these children differ in their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors? She doesn't ask. Nor does she investigate cultures in which men play a greater role in child-rearing than they do in ours. Are these cultures less violent, do they go to war less often? She doesn't ask. Without data from the real world, her concepts are pure speculation."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,I recieved this email a week after I placed the order:The following items were not shipped for the reason(s) given:CH-RT CHUMS CLASSIC EYEWEAR RETAINERThis item is discontinued and will not be shipped with your order.As of today it is still be offered. To me this is false advertising or some kind of bait and switch
5,Great camera,"I love this camera. I takes really great pictures. In response to the review by ""tacissej"", it doesn't take pictures if you are too close to what your taken the picture of. I'd rather zoom out or take a step back than have a bad picture."
3,"An ""okay"" camera","This camera is basically ""okay."" It functions fine...WHEN it functions! Sometimes it is very tempermental and won't take the picture! Even if the picture taker is not moving and everything is in focus, the camera's red light will come on. Only after repeatedly pressing the ""take picture"" button will it operate. This produces pictures of people with plastic smiles from holding their expressions. In addition, the red eye only works about 80% of the time. Pictures that DO come out come out nice and clear, but this camera can be frustrating. Don't pay more than $85.00 for it!"
1,keeps coming off,"My dog had a choking accident with a regular collar so I was thrilled to find this. It's no solution however. If I grab my dog by this collar it just comes off. When she was in the woods playing it came off and I couldn't find it, so there we were on a walk with no collar and no I.D."
2,Maybe later,"This is a collection of seemeingly more recent tracks from King Tubby and Channel One. I just wasn't that impressed. The rhythms are kind of weak, although there is a little bit of interesting music over the span of the two disc set. Only reccomended for hardcore Tubby heads."
5,Clarity and Power,"My introduction to these peaks of Bachs exceptional output were on a reissued version on cheap tapes bought in Australia around 1985. The readings were so clear that without understanding the complex structure of the music I felt I could ""see"" it in my mind's eye. At the same time the beauty and tunefulness were exceptionally clear and well defined. Yes there is precision and clarity, but for me this enhances the music in a way other performances fail to do.I have listened to other, better regarded versions but at times they seem to lose the thread or become muddled by the complexity of the composition. Not so Sitkovetsky.For me one of the peaks of classical music recording."
2,Bach with clinical precision,"According to the Amazon listing, this particular recording is relatively recent. I have had a Sitkovetsky recording of the unaccompanied sonatas for about 13 years. I have always adored these Bach sonatas and have listened to and played them with fervor. But in those 13 years, I've listened to the Sitkovetsky recording probably no more than a total of 5-10 times and never all at once. The notes are all there, no mistakes. Tuning is fine. But there is no passion and no sensitivity for Baroque violin performance technique that I can detect. Sitkovetsky's interpretation is totally clinical, sterile and completely uninteresting- rather like a surgical procedure. Certainly, these are austere compositions by nature, but I don't think Bach had this kind of sterile performance practice in mind when he wrote them."
2,Dull Dull Dull,I think my title says it all really. Not insight very repetitive and not well written. What should have been an interesting topic poorly handled. The only interest was the changes of attitudes over the decades. Borrow this from the Library or but second hand
2,"Lots of stories, but no illumination","I hoped that the book would provide insight into my father's life and thoughts. Unfortunately, the 39 interviews seem to be shallow, in that there isn't much delving into the details for a true character portrait (like New Yorker in-depth interviews). Each chapter feels like a 30-minute conversation -- too short to know a person and what makes them unique.It seems odd to me all the stories end happily and with hope (no mention of any person having additional negative burdens, for example lingering guilt, depression, regret, or unfortunate contraction of AIDs). This makes me wonder if the author has filtered out information. Perhaps he didn't, but I was expecting a variety of outcomes from 39 different people.All in all, I'm glad the author has recorded these interviews. Now if he could select a few interesting interviews and expand them into another book, that would make for a very interesting read!"
3,"Some interest, little insight","David Leddick's volume of interviews with gay men who once were or are currently married to women promises a good deal more than it delivers. Organized by the age of interviewed subjects, starting with the oldest, the mostly short interviews are sometimes touching, sometimes titillating. After a very short while, however, monotony sets in, due to the sameness of the subjects (handsome, successful, professional, and with a very few exceptions, white) and the persistent lack of any real insight into the motivations of the men profiled. Credit must be given to Leddick for not attempting psychoanalysis for which he is obviously not qualified; but the lack of any compensating interest or other profundity means the final impression is quite similar to many of his collections of male nude photographs--polished, facile but hard to remember when one has closed the book."
5,Great Product,I use this to contour the sound of my acoustic guitar into a mixer. It works as a DI but with more features
1,Such a disappointment,"I am a crafter and was looking for a product to store embellishments for card-making and scrapbooking. This item has been my LEAST favorite of all storage containers. The compartments are not customizable and they are overly large. The dividers move easily so things can slide under and mix with other sections. The box is rather large and bulky. However, if you are looking for large then that is not a detraction. Still, if you want a storage box with compartments, Art Bin has many available that are easier to customize and much higher quality. They are also available through Amazon. If you are looking for something ideal for much smaller parts, then [Storage Box Divider Tray 30 Round Stackable Clear Containers Multi-functional Organizer For Small Items] is the best item you can buy for items such as eyelets and brads, or items about that size."
5,Excellent Olivier,"The Merchant of Venice has always been one of Shakespeare's most troublesome and controversial plays. Technically it is a comedy because it ends with a wedding, but it explores issues of prejudice and anti-semitism, and Shylock's fate (forced conversion and poverty) is hardly cheering. Hal Holbrooke once said that the measure of any Shylock is how he leaves the stage after the climactic courtroom scene. Olivier's exit is pained, proud, and sad. This is a stark play of a stubborn and despised man who is destroyed not because of his obvious personal flaws, but because of the prejudices and unfairness of his persecutors. After all, Shylock abided by the contract, Antonio weasled out and punished Shylock to boot."
3,The Merchant of Venice,"I love this play...it is full of comedy, sorrow, and lovely complex characters. However, this version of the play leaves much to be desired. Olivier is wonderful as Shylock but the casting of Portia and Antonio is horrible. Portia is played by Olivier's real life wife and comes across 20 years to old for the part. I have always invisioned Antonio and Bassanio as the same age and this version has a very old Antonio. Many important scenes are missing and make the ""movie"" somewhat choppy. I wanted to care about the characters but the only thoing this movie forces you to care about is Shylock. (thank God Olivier plays the part so you can enjoy fabulous acting) This version is useful to me ONLY because it is the only version of this play available."
1,The Single Worst Shakespeare Production I've Ever Seen,"It's one thing to portray Shylock as more sinned against than sinning. It's a very valid reading of the text. But this version makes Shylock a one-dimensional victim/martyr, killing any of the tension in the play. Combine that with the Snidely Whiplash-style portrayls of the Christians and this is over-sanitized, badly acted melodrama. Disappointing for fans of Shakespeare, Olivier, Jeremy Brett, and anyone else involved in this mess."
2,M. of Venice,I have the video of this film and wanted to have it in DVD. Sadly it is all in Italian with no sub-titles so it hasn't done me much good.
5,"Great play, great actors","A great play, played by great actors. I regret that they wear modern costumes, but that was in fashion ... Jeremy Brett good looks are here dashing (to get him awarded a posthumous Bafta, go to facebook:""posthumous BAFTA for Jeremy Brett""), and plays perfectly his part. This VHS is a must for his fans!"
5,Targets the hard spots!,"Just received this book a couple of days ago. I just finished reading it today. It is an easy read. It has a lot of information packed into it. Very informative; well written. She has four different workouts; progressively going from easier than harder to harder. I really don't classify any of them as easy. These exercises really target the hard spots. She included diagrams for the exercises. If anyone is looking to shape their thighs or [...], this book is highly recommended by me. I love it so much that I'm recommending it to my friend!"
4,sick bay collabo,"I just wanted to write a quick review for this album. I thought the first reviewer did a good job, but one thing that stood out to me was he said he hasn't heard any of marv's, keak's, or PSD's albums apparently prior to 2006. I think that doesn't give you a fair perception of this collabo. I feel this album is better than their solo projects because each of them can become a bit monotonous on their own. The beats are on slap throughout and I would say there are at least 10 songs that tight. I would give it 3 and 1/2 or 4 stars.4 songs that make the album worth a purchase: Gumbo Pot, Cus/Cus, Burden of His Youth, Yeeee"
5,WONDERFUL Fun!!!! This book is a treasure and enjoyable!!!,"Absolutely loved this book! My son (8 years old) and I thoroughly enjoyed the marvelous pictures and great cartoony art for products from days gone by! The binding of the book is weak and the thick pages tend to fall out, but other than that,...a treasure to keep and refer back to."
3,"Content Fine, Print Quality average","The content of this book is great. As a practising geologist, I still find it a useful overview and for junior staff, I recommend it as the first point of reference. I strongly suggest this as a book to get if you haven't.Having said that, this is not a new 2007 Edition; the content page describes this as a 2007 Reissue by Waveland Press of the 1986 Publication. I compared it directly to a 1986 version we also have in the office, and its the same, except that the 2007 reissue is printed (digital?)copy of the original. I've seen this in another revised edition (Applied Geophysics, Telford). Its OK for B&W; line drawings but like any scan or photocopy, photos come out all contrasty and photos of fine rock textures lose much of their detail. The hardback cover is good quality, the paper is OK, but I would much rather have bought a second hand copy of the 1986 hardbackA for content, C for effort, B overall."
4,As a Textbook...,"This book is interesting. It is quite dense in places and gets hard to read, but overall it is very useful. It is the main book in my economic geology class and is supplemented by several others that focus more specifically on other topics."
2,Not Pleased With This Product,"Well, my birdfeeder was labeled the Birdscapes 735 The Preserve; however, the feeder that I received didn't exactly match the product received. My feeder did not have the diagonal double wire cage. It featured a square brown grid that wasn't all that attractive. On top of that, the feeder's specification listed that it could handle ""mixed seed"", so I assumed that it would have some sort of way to adapt the ports to accommodate the thistle seed that gold finches and other small birds enjoy. I wrote to the manufacturer, and they reported that this feeder only accommodates large seeds (like sunflower, safflower, etc.); however, those large birds are not going to fit through the grid to be able to feed. I did write to Amazon.com with the discrepancies (and they were great to offer a $ 5.00 credit towards my next order because the image posted didn't match what I received). I wouldn't order this product again. I would choose once that can be filled with the smaller seed."
2,NOT SQUIRREL PROOF!,"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a squirrel proof feeder - it looks like one, but it isn't. Squirrels can lift the lid, climb in and eat all they want. I guess it's a nice bird feeder (but so is a paper cup). In my opinion, a bird feeder is a squirrel feeder unless it's properly designed."
5,Looks and works great.,"I had a birdfeeder with a grid on it for years and it finally bit the dust. I couldn't find the same model, but when I saw this one I thought it looked much better; with the crossing slanted grid instead of the boxed grid my old one had. It works great - the little birds just swoop right in but the noisy blue birds are out of luck."
4,mom will like it. :),mom will like it a lot. I hope so anyways. It's what she wanted anyways. so we will see tomorrow.
2,Disappointing,"Yes, the design of this feeder is attractive. And it probably would keep gray (not red) squirrels out of the seed--at least for a while.BUT . . . according to the package labeling on the feeder itself, the feeder holds only TWO, not THREE, pounds of seed as advertized. And, even more important, I found the metal material used in construction flimsy. In addition, the thin plastic hanging cord probably could be downed with a nibble or two by any reasonably intelligent rodent. In short, I doubt this feeder would survive a single New England winter. Disappointing."
4,Finally....out-foxed the sly squirrel!,"It's been up in the garden for 1 week and I haven't seen any squirrels attempting to 'break the code' on this bird feeder!The last ""squirrel proof"" one we had purchased was finally assaulted from hanging up side down to circumvent the doors to the birdseed from closing shut from his weight....sagacious little creature,The only drawback is that the larger birds cannot get inside to sit on the perches where the seed is stored, but we are mainly attracting the small finches and they love the feeder! And some seed falls to the bottom where the larger birds can get at it.It's definitely a 'better mouse-trap' in the squirrel fighting battle of the bird feeders!"
4,bird lover's delight,"This feeder took a few days for the birds to venture inside of the squirrel-proof barrier, but now they are used to it & it's fun to watch them enjoying the seeds without the squirrels upstaging them. At least so far!"
2,Grackle Paradise,"I purchased this feeder to use in Sanibel, Florida. It was designed to keep out squirrels and large birds. We have no squirrels but the large birds have not been put off and can empty the feeder in half a day. We call this feeder the 'Grackle Cafe' and will be taking it down."
4,"Birdscapes 735 The Preserve Feeder, 3 lb capacity","Why would anyone make a metal cage surround and then use a plastic hanger???????I do like this product, but do not expect the hanger to last as long as the feeder."
1,Bird proof,"If you don't want squirrels to eat seeds intended for birds I'd advise you to avoid this product. As advertised, squirrels can't get at the seeds. Unfortunately, it's also bird proof. The wire meshing is so dense that birds can't get in to access the seeds. I'm looking out my window. While nearby feeders that are accessible to squirrels are swarmed by hungry birds of various sizes and colors, the new feeder hangs alone, full of seeds."
3,Well written with excellent references,This is an interesting read. Dr. Ruth has also compiled wonderful set of references as well.
3,I thought i was ok but i didn't like it generally because...,"I thought it was ok but I didn't like it generally because it takes forever to get the story started. In the beginning of the book its about London and Gentlemen Clubs in London and things like that. Once he gets the bet going then it gets a little bit more exciting. He goes to places you can only imagine in the book. Like India and China, its really cool. Then he also goes to places that you went to and you like to see what the author said it was like. When she writes about the places you visited you like to see what she said about that place. Like she writes about Utah and she writes about polygamy and the buffaloes and things like that. Then through out the book he runs into big problems. Like he took the wrong turn here or there. He rides a broken Boat so that he can make it to London on time. So it gets exciting when y0ou see that he has a problem to get around but it takes forever to get to those problems."
1,Don't Trust TigerDirect,I saw this listing and was very excited to find a Short throw lens for under 100.00 (the listed price) but I was shocked when I received a carrying bag in the mail instead of the lens. I called TigerDirect and was told the item was listed incorrectly and that it was Amazons fault so they would not honor the listing. I than sent Amazon an email and they said it was TigerDirect responsibility for the listing not Amazons So I called TigerDirect back and was told it doesn't matter who's fault it is they would not honor the listing. Don't Trust TigerDirect!!
4,Easy to understand but lacking necessary words.,"Great book for a novice. The illustrations are simple to understand and easy to remember through association. The only problem that I found was that when looking for any Christian words, such as God, Lord, or christian, I was left disappointed. There were also other words missing, such as storm, freedom, and so. I was left frustrated with incomplete phrases."
1,American Sign Language Dictionary,"This book was ordered for someone in prison. As of this writting he has still not recieved it. I will wait till the first of the year,then take action."
1,Nightmare Bach,"Dear God, steer clear of this unholy aberration of the suites that mince Bach into something at times hardly resembling the score. If you are into super odd accents on off beats, strange phrasing, time signatures all over the place and kinetic, frenetic disjointed discombobulated gesticulating you may have found your penultimate reference set. I own about 25 sets of the suites by different artists and this is hands down the worst I have ever imagined. A total sonic catastrophe. I felt almost ill after hearing just 2 tracks of these future toaster coasters. Whoever he studied with it wasn't enough. Sorry but that's how I feel."
4,Heavy Duty product,Compared to other snatch blocks the photo doesn't do justice to the product. Just the weight alone compared to others surprised me. It's definately built for a heaver application and with the grease fitting I'm sure it will cut down on the heat generated by friction. I also like the straight etched lines above the hole that show possible failure or overload. Amazons price was competative and shipping was pretty quick.
4,Anthology has many surprises,"Rather than assemble a standard greatest hits/concert favourites package, the boys went for all sorts of little-known tunes on this, their final album before (apparently) breaking up. You won't hear such well-known tunes as My Heart Is In Ireland or Irish Eyes, but there are some new tunes (including a surprisingly enjoyable cover of a Bee Gees ballad) and remakes of older stuff. Wait 'til you hear the full drums and electric guitar version of Broad Black Brimmer. It's a load of fun."
4,a solid remake of the original megaman x,"i bought this game because i LOVE megaman and i was a bit dissapointed. but its still pretty good. the good things about it is that its fun and the characters are cool(zero is my fav!). on the downside the graphics are choppy and the voice acting is medicore. you would know this,its also hard-but not impossible."
4,Just Alright....,"This 2-d platform shooter is difficult, too hard for its own good. The stages are painfully SHORT. The graphics is just okay.... Stages are also generic and gameplay design is lacking. I really want to like this game but it was hard. I think Megaman Zero 3 and 4 for Game Boy Advance are actually better, cough cough.Overall this game is good not great. Ultimate Ghost 'n Goblins is better."
4,Fun overall,"Fun overall, but do know this is a collection of older games an in a somewhat arcade-ish format. Therefore, it will be hard, but not impossible hard. If you're into that kinda stuff(like me) this will be fun. If you're not, then this might not be the game for you."
5,Classic Games Remade,In order to breath life into a great classic game like this here is a good way to do it. The Graphics finally up to date slight changes and some the enemies were easier to take down but the difficulty setting put it were it belongs. Then you get to play as Vile and that was cool. All in all this Game is still great I very much hope and look forward to the rest of the MegaMan games getting thier turn like this.
5,Incredible Game,"this game is amazing. The voices might throw you off if you have gotten used to just silent gaming.The megaman story mode is very easy, and im still working on the vile. The best part is that you can see a full length anime episode of the ""day of E"" explaining alot about megaman(at least i thought so).I am very pleased with my order"
1,Nothing new except graphics.,Another lame port. Graphics are really cool though. Stick with the snes version.
2,Interesting premis but very contrived story line.,"Although this book contains some of the most fascinating subject matter available, the reader must first sift through a poorly written and blatantly contrived autobiography of Jason Moss. This author is very self-serving and egotistical and this takes much away from the enjoyability of the novel. Furthermore, any rational individual will see that Moss fabricated much of the story. I do not doubt that he corresponded with these killers, but his mindless ramblings and overall immaturity does not relate well to the mature reader, which tends to be anyone over 18 for this novel. The facts in The Final Victim are inter-related with boring, fabricated dialogue and conflicts Moss faces."
3,Disturbing But Fascinating,"When I read the description for Jason Moss' book, I found myself drawn to it. Like him, I have always been fascinated by what drives a serial killer; or, I suppose, how I can prevent myself from becoming a victim of one of them. Because my fear of becoming a victim is so strong, I have been drawn to many movies and books about them to see how I could prevent it from happening to me.While I found myself fascinated by Jason's experiences, I was also appalled. I couldn't believe how much risk he put himself and his family through; giving his own address to killers with all kinds of connections, I thought, was very foolish. So I found myself very interested and frustrated with the book at the same time. He has a very simplistic style of writing, but it got the point across. I read this book in two days, so I have to say that it was a good, if disturbing, read."
2,Through the eyes of the alleged future serial killer,While reading this I kept wondering about the motivation of the author. Perhaps are more appropriate title than Last Victim could have been Through the Eyes of the Alleged Future Serial Killer. Perhaps a good read for criminal profiles to learn about the perspective of how serial killers are made.
1,Don't bother.,Some nonfiction writers can make their stories come alive for the reader. Moss is not one of them.
2,The next book...,"For the unforgotten chapter in this book, see the reviewer from St. Paul's comments. It this a real review? The reviewer seems to have a lot more insight into the author and his psychotherapist partner than the average reader could have gained from this book. I found the book to be generally dry, and lacking a real connection with the average reader. I do not agree that this is a very insightful book as the reviewer, David, from St. Paul would like you to believe."
2,"Good Story Line, BUT...","I first heard about this book on a radio morning show, Dwyer and Michael's on Q106.5. All of the comments on it were great, and it was on one of my favorite subjects - serial killers, so I ran right out and bought it. BIG MISTAKE!Jason Moss had a great idea, and it was fascinating how he got the attention of these killers. What ruined this book was the constant reminder of the author's hetrosexuality. I would have liked to see more of the letters that they wrote. Those were what kept me reading.Next time, Jason, worry more about your subject and less about your sexual preference!"
1,I agree with my colleague from Chicago on this one,"I too am a mental health counselor, and am rather concerned by this account of a manipulative young man. Read this book, but with caution. Could it be a serial killer's words you are reading? Or truly just a lost young man searching for attention?"
3,Too bad the real experience wasn't better written,"I applaud Jason's persistance, drive and determination in relating to these killers, but the book itself was lacking in some areas. Although I found the book and subject matter interesting, it wasn't one of those ""can't put down, page-turners"" for me. It was just missing something."
5,A book that my friends are fighting over to borrow,"I found this book very enlighting, and I highly recommended it to anyone and everyone that likes a good true crime book."
4,Don't try this at home.,To any guy who may be so inclined after reading this book: Do not try this at home. It isn't remotely cool to befriend serial killers. This makes it very hard to get chicks.
4,Overall interesting book.,This is a well-written and informative true crime story. Recommended for those interested in adding to a nonfiction library.
1,Thanks but no thanks............,"Jason Moss tries to show how brave he is by writing serial killers- maybe he didn't know that there is already a sub-culture of people who do this? It doesn't make for a good book, since it seems that most of the work is contrived anyways."
2,definitely a first book,"Sorry, but the book did not capture my attention. I admire the efforts of Jason, however; he failed to acquire my attention for very long. I did learn that most of these killers had one thing in common (except for Charles Manson) they were so in to pornography. I still do not think anyone understands these personalities as of yet. Please do not say you do."
2,"Intersting, but highly problematic","This is a quick read. Typical true-crime pulp style. Nothing spectacular about the writing, but the story is indeed unique.There are a lot of problems with the morals the book is trying to sell though.Not a bad beach book, but don't expect to learn a whole lot from it."
1,Screaming for an editor,"I am trying to slog through this book, but the writing is so atrocious it is difficult. I don't know who created the ""author's"" voice--Kottler or Moss, but it is self-serving and irritating. I know that Moss has a harrowing experience with Gacy, but I am having a hard time caring at all. I had not considered fabrication of the story until I read other reviews--they may be on to something. I recommend not wasting your time reading this book."
1,Fatal Shortcoming,"This book lacks something. Inexperienced author. Bad editor. Perhaps. It's rarely for lack of smarts or vision that an author misses his/her que to satisfy the reader. Authors stumble because of one simple, fatal shortcoming. The fatal shortcoming in this instance: Overall execution of the book. Oh well, better luck next time."
1,Not remotely cool.,"Seeking out the attention of serial killers isn't remotely cool. The message your sending is, ""I'm an even bigger moran then you initially suspected."" This makes it very hard to get chicks."
3,"Innovative book promises to be compelling, falls short","Moss' angle into the subject of serial killers is innovative: he cultivates intimate relationships with several who've achieved noteriety, and his efforts come to fruition in his dangerous correspondence with John Wayne Gacy. At times Moss' observations are astute; often, however, they lack a maturity and real understanding of his subjects. His perennial need to point out to the reader that he finds their interests repulsive, that he is by God a straight heterosexual male and let there be no mistake about it, is a distraction to what could have been an opportunity to see beyond the labels and media hype and into the humanity of these unfortunate and tortured souls. The book is written in the simple, gregarious style of a sophomore composition. Where he does shine through is in his ambition to explore the unknown, but perhaps he, too, found the geography as distant and ineffable as the psychologists and officials who preceded him."
4,"Great strory, great idea, but need more description","The book was great and Jason should be pround of all he has achieved, but the book definately needed a better editor. I thought it could have been more descriptive in some places, and less descriptive in others (the sexual scenes). Overall though, it was a good read."
2,Utterly disappointing!,"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book after previewing it on the LEEZA show. I could have waited forever! Not only is it poorly written, it's hard to believe. Even if what Jason Moss writes is true, how could he endanger the lives of his family to satisfy his own selfish needs to be number one? What was he able to learn from the killers that the police and psychologists could not? This book was not only easy to put down, but difficult to finish. The only thing Jason proved is his ignorance at playing mind games with obviously deranged serial killers! I hope he doesn't have to look over his shoulder the rest of his life."
5,READ THIS BOOK,You will think about what you reveal about your personal life to strangers after you read this book. I couldn't put it down in fact I am going to read it again RIGHT NOW!
3,i thought it was a beginer book for serial killer buffs.,"I thought the idea of the book was fantastic. I thought the execution left a bit to be desired. I found the writing style a little to simplistic for my liking. I thought the author spent at times too much time on himself and his animate denial of being a freak or a homosexual. The author did offer great insight into the make-up of a victim but you had to wade through most of the book to get to this information. I think this is a great book for someone that is just starting to get into the serial killer genre. Overall, I found the first book by Douglas and the books by Ressler to be more informative and to be better reads."
2,Homoerotic pornography,"As others have foretold, Jason Moss' ego precedes his work. He adamantly tries to convince the reader of his superior intelligence; however, let me stress to you here- I am UNLV alunmi, and believe me, UNLV is not known for it's outstanding academic strengths. Ask yourself why Moss didn't attend Berkley or Princeton or any elite East Coast institution.The book was written on bragging rights. He continually asked the question ""How many other people could say they get letters from a serial killer??"" But if the means is writing sexually explicit letters to a murderer who will use it to gratify himself thinking about you, then it makes you wonder how many people would actually WANT the ends. But in case you forget, Moss will also continually remind the reader that he is in fact heterosexual- right after he finishes a letter about himself sexually molesting his younger brother. The book is gay porn disguised as literature.(...)"
2,What Jason Moss did on his summer vacation.,"This would have been an excellent book if Jason Moss had written an introduction, and we could have actually read the letters he talks about so much in a very general way. I found his writing style to be very bland and I did not relate to him and his ego at all."
2,Strange Concept For a Book,"I have no idea why this guy thought it would be fun to write to a serial killer, but hey, what do I know? I'm just the general (paranoid) public. Don't need any killers knowing where I live.I found the book to be kinda long-winded & irrelevent to the concept of writing/meeting Gacy. There was just too much ""mush"" for it to be a compelling read. The only part I enjoyed was when the author would quote Gacy.Find something better to read."
5,A unique masterpiece.,This book does indeed start off slower than one would want. However it enables one to fully understand where Jason is coming from. This is the only book that I have found that gives perspective in such detail on how a serial killer stalks their pray. The book puts the reader right there whith the killer showing his techniques in bringing in his victims. This is the only book of its kind where the author is the unintended victim.
5,"Excellent service, excellent book","Seller shipped in timely manner, book was so good! Would definately buy from this seller again. Love true crime books."
3,interesting,"I bought this book after reading about the author. I thought it was informative, but not very well written. If you are interested in Gacy then you will probably find this book interesting."
4,Spellbinding and scarey,"I accidentally found ""Dr Mr Gacy"" on tv and watched it, which prompted me to find this book. Having seen the movie, I was not suprized by the content, however, the movie did not include parts about the others he interviewed.Its frightening to think about the accessiblity people have to the likes of these murderers.Mr Moss was braver that I can imagine and somewhat foolish at the same time.This is a quick read, couldn't put it down until I was done, and it gives a frightening glimpse into the mind of these killers.My only disappointment is I purchased the Kindle Edition and have not been able to access the pictures that were included in the printed copy (customer service and I are working on it)."
5,Obsession,"I thought that this was an incredibly well written book. The Author obviously really got into the minds of these notorious serial killers. I think; however, that he became a little TOO involved with his subjects, risking his own safety. It was very intriguing and fascinating reading about his encounters with these killers. He was descriptive on every page, and kept me on the edge of my seat. I wasn't able to put this book down! I bought it Wednesday night, and finished it on Thursday night. This is a DEFINITE must read for anyone interested in this topic, like myself."
4,Great Book!,"I read this book in one day, I could not put it down. Im almost thankful this book wasnt any longer because I would of got behind on my own studies! I think it is a book that would interest almost anyone. Jason Moss is a unique individual, and i will be looking for more books of his in the future!"
2,It's been done before,"Jason Moss delves into the minds of the most notorious serial killers. Acutally, he doesn't. Although he has interesting exchanges with Dahmer and Gacy, you feel as if something is missing. It is. Nothing about the book is climatic. It's just about a boy who tells a tale. How much of it is true and how much is exaggerated is known only to Jason. Dahmer and Gacy aren't around to verify and Ramirez and Manson are so egotistical that they are enthralled by anyone who worships them. Moss had a lot of courage to go into a room with Gacy. Or maybe it was stupidity. Whatever it was, he wasn't the only one to ever do that. Moss stated that he now knows exactly how Gacy's victims felt. Bull. He only got a minute piece of what they experienced. There's no way he experienced anything near the hell that those unfortunate people felt. Lots of people write and visit serial killers. Moss has nothing new to offer true-crime fans."
2,Fascinating subject... Boring book,"You gotta hand it to Jason Moss for coming up with this project and following through on it. Alas, he could have benefited from an ""as told to"" ghostwriter or a stern editor: the book reads like a freshman composition ""What I did last year"". I had to prop my eyes open with toothpicks to get through the middle part. To be fair, it does perk up when he actually goes to see Gacy.One thing that bothered me is the absence of any facsimiles of letters he got (the Dahmer sketch is an archival stock photo, and it appears that the drawings from Ramirez may not actually be by him). Since one of the themes of the book is deception and game-playing, I'd rather have seen photos of some of the letters, instead of a photo of the mail carrier!"
2,"""gotcha"" title over substance","i admit i was very intrigued by the title- but the content- why bother? after the informed prologue by the professor each chapter by josh reads like ""and then i was so crafty, intelligent, and well-informed beyond my years"" that i began to think i was reading a term paper by some high school student with no life in the present and way too much time on his hands. i agree with his mom he needed to get a job! but alas i was duped- but not enough to complete the endless repetition of ""and then i did this"". to prospective readers- save your valuable time not to mention money and don't bother with the drivel. oh the two stars are for the title and the prologue and epilogue by josh's instructor at college."
3,Look not into the abyss...,"Jason Moss spends a lot of time in his book ""The Last Victim, bragging about his ability to craft the perfect persona to capture his audience. He became a little boy to get Gacy's interest, he became a Satanic priest for Ramirez, and he becomes... an author for his readers. He judges his audience to be the heterosexual, casual reader of true crime and so he keeps interjecting ""I'm not gay!"" as often as possible. He keeps saying, ""Gosh, I know you wonder why a normal kid like me is doing something so crazy. Just keep reading, and maybe I'll tell you."" I got the distinct impression that his ""wide-eyed kid who wised up"" style was just another performance, and even as the book was moderately entertaining, it felt very contrived. It's a nice book for newcomers to the true-crime genre, but more experienced readers are bound to feel a bit frustrated with his approach."
1,Would rather give it a ZERO rating,"Extremely unimpressed with Mr. Moss and Mr. Moss' book. Nearly a full 75% of the book is about this snot nosed kid who does nothing but whine about his life, his mother, his girlfriend, etc. He goes on about his own intelligence ad nauseum. It was getting to the point where if he mentioned his odd fascination with true crime books one more time I was going to have to scream.Perhaps if he had had this ghost written, by someone who knew what they were doing, he could have produced a much better book. As it stands, the book is for the most part boring. I also believe that he embellished some parts of the book. If you look at his picture and then read the supposed tale of his encounter with Mr. Gacy you'll understand what I'm saying.I have never in my life, until this book, ever thrown one away. This book went straight into the trash- where it belongs.Save your money, pass this one by in a hurry."
3,Portrait of a Overly Self-Confident Young Adult,"From the time I saw this book on the shelf from the time I got home and began to read it, I could hardly wait to dive into a book about someone who actually got in the mind of so many of America's famous serial killers. But, to my dissapointment, when I actually began to read it all I found was compliment after compliment about Jason Moss. The chapters that do deal with the killers and his contact with them are excellent. This novel could have been so much better if the author would have focused on more on the killers and less on himself. I didn't buy the book to learn about his life and his problems."
1,Who Is The REAL Victim?,"While I certainly would never call John Wayne Gacy a ""victim"", I felt that Jason Moss was the victimizer in the very sick relationship he developed with Gacy over a period of time. Jason Moss may not be a sociopathic killer, but he certainly is a sociopath! I have read many true crime books and by calling himself a ""victim"", Jason Moss devalues those people who truly were victims of the cruel and sadistic creeps Jason Moss CHOSE to come in contact with."
2,What else happened?,"The homo-erotic undertones in this story leave me asking for more information. Why does the author while posing as a male prostitute to engage Gacy not allow us the satisfaction of reading the letters he used to charm the killer? While I found the book interesting far too many things were referenced but never explained. Like ""how could parents allow thier teenage son to use himself as bait for a mass murderer?"" I'm facinated.You are left wondering about the oft stressed heterosexual Jason. How does he so convincinly write about sexual relations with his brother? The great lengths at which the authors go to present Jason as a ""normal straight teenager"" seem a bit streched.There is way too much missing from this book in my opinion."
1,The Last Victim.....,"What happened to my review????? I noticed that a short time ago there were 161 ""reviews"" now there are only 156. Can someone there explain this??? Were some purged?Steve Sachs"
1,Self-absorbed trife,"Not much to be said that wasn't already covered in the other negative reviews. The author is smug, and severly overestivmates both his skills at manipulation and writing ability. The good news is, if you go to his website (he's now an attorney) he's now BALD!!! Hahahahahahha, look at his photo, he tries to look so intense and determined but he's BALD. Hair today, gone tomorrow..."
1,Simply Awful,Don't waste your time. This book is more about Jason Moss and his egomania then it is about serial killers. It did not offer any new insight or information at all.
3,the many masks of a horryfying killer,"""Knock, knock, knock!!!""""Who is it?""""It's the police! Open up""""Go away I've done nothing wrong""""We have a search warrant. Come out withyour hands up!""John Wayne Gacy was a homosexual sex offender, who killed 33 young men, and later pleaded innocent. He's one of the many characters that were antagonized by Jason Moss's ingenious methods of getting a killer to admit their crimes. We only know so much about what goes on in the mind of a killer. What makes them do what they do?Just walk down the halls of a prison and all you will hear is, ""I'm innocent"". Many are not, but what about the ones who really are?Their pleas are smuggled into the walls of prison cells never to be taken into consideration. However, the men Jason interviewed are not in that category. The author wants to get to the bottom of their reasons, which he does by portraying himself as the last victim."
1,The kid is as sick as the individuals he discussed,"After reading Moss' book, I was horrified that someone would put themselves in the position that he did. I purchased the book after listening to an interview of Mr. Moss on the radio and thought it would be really interesting. Not the case. Jason Moss, then 18, really put himself and his family in a bad position. The book was not that good. Listening to Jason discuss his relationship with JWG and the others really made me question the mental stability of this young man."
4,An outstanding novel of turning the killer into the victim,"Jason Moss used a craft and tecnhique so unique in order to establish a relationship with one of America's most famous Serial Killers..And in this process, he was able to experience the fear that others had experienced and unfortunately never lived to tell..Jason has brought us a very insightful look at confronting the demons in a man. By using the same technique that this killer used to win over his victims, Jason himself wins this one hands down...An excellent and must have for crime buffs...Kudos to you Jason!"
1,"4 words: Night School, Basic English","Somebody please get this boy a dictionary and thesauraus. How many times can an author use ""whatever!"" and the reader still take the book seriously?"
2,Sorta Dissapointing,"This is a great story, very unique and original, but the flaws exist in the execution. The font used is something from a nightmarish term paper, the writing amateurish and banal. I think once he sharpens his literary skills, Mr. Moss could make an impact on the true crime circuit. All in all, this male thought this was an interesting read, but one to save for paperback at the beach."
1,Pathetic attempt at self promotion,Mr. Moss tries to parlay his juvenile fascination with serial killers into a legitimate book about them and others such as himself. Contains precious little real journalism and ludicrously exaggerates the danger he faced when he visited John Gacy. Moss is apparently now a bottom-feeding attorney in Nevada.
2,Egomania at its finest,"This Jason Moss character is so full of himself, the book is difficult to wade through. I found myself skimming the pages for any shred of real literature. There are a VERY few truly fascinating passages, but other than that, the book is so full of JASON MOSS and his accomplishments, it is truly annoying and sickening. I agree with another reviewer, but it cheap if you must!"
1,Adolescent drivel,"An unforgivable waste of time. This is an honors student? I would not like to meet this manipulative and terribly immature young man, and I tossed this book into the trash before I was halfway through. Moss is scary--seems to be killer material himself--but what's even scarier is that he got this thing published."
4,"A great read for entertainment, disapointment analysis","I think this was a very entertaining book to read for entertainment, but it lacked some very important qualities. I would have liked to have seen a little bit more analysis on the killers themselves. I still find it hard to believe that he went all the way out to Illinois to see Mr. Gacy, the Killer Clown. I find Jason to be somewhat of a serial killer groupie, wanna be, but I can't mark him down for that. He wrote a good book that I had to read all the way through because it was too hard to stop."
3,AWAKENS STRANGE IDEAS IN THE HEAD OF THE READER...,"Im a great fan of true crime, and have bought a lot of books on that subject. I heard of this crazy guy that wrote to serialkillers, and thought to myself; I have to know more! The book itself seemed to be more about Jason than about the letters he got. It got boring from time to time, but Im still glad I bought it.It was a fascinating story that inspired me to write Richard Ramirez. And, you know what? He replied!"
2,While intriguing story...lacks the voice of a writer.,"Jason had a great idea and I am sure that much can be learned from his research. Unfortunatly, the book fails to provide that for the reader. We get insight into his persona and what drove him to risk not only his life, but the ones of those he loves. But all that seems to be provided about the research that he did was sexual and not what you would expect. I hope Jason does try again. I am sure the next one will be better - after all he does seem to be somewhat of a perfectionist."
4,Shocking story!!,I am shocked by the occurrances that took place as described in this book. A must-read for true crime fans and a great potential movie. I felt the book was well written and kept me on the edge of my seat.
1,a WRITTEN TO MAKE MONEY !!!,"I watched the interview with Moss on 20/20.his depiction of his visit with Gacy was glorified to make it sound dangerous.Two months before his visit,I was on death row,with John Gacy.Yes I was alone in the room with him,and no guards present.that is policy.He also told me that his handcuffs could be used as a weapon. but he explained it to me, he didnt threaten me with them.John Gacy was on Death row for thirteen years, In 23 hour a day lock-down.He was no monster, just a frail old man.I spent 6 hours there with my wife!! Not once did I feel uncomfortable.This story is the same story thousands of other visitors have gone through at Menard. He is just trying to make money on it!"
5,"Very Informative, Easily Read!","How can one who dislikes reading adequately describe this book? I finished it in two days and couldn't put it down! The author seemed to do a great job at investigating the killers before attempting to make contact, therefore producing a sweeter response. He presents a struggle within himself as the responses he receives were oftentimes difficult for him to swallow. He portrays the killers as people with incredible depth and feelings, yet does not forget the psychological problems that exist. I found myself feeling what the author felt, seeing what he saw. As the final execution took place I ushered a huge sigh of relief with the author. I would definitely recommend this book to all who are remotely interested in understanding the criminal mind."
4,Chilling,"For anyone with an interest in true crime, this is a great read. Very informative, with details that certainly are not widely known. This book is definitely not for the faint of heart, and it will be enough to haunt even the most tough-minded of readers."
1,Boring!,"I am thankful I picked this book up at the used book store. I am also fascinated with murder and mayhem material. Not a book about a young narcissist. It seemed Jason used this forum to aim & fire built up anger towards his mother. Isn't that a partial psychological profile of Serial Killers? Jason comes across as a bright young person, but his obvious goal was self-notoriety through the manipulation of serial killers written in a sixth grade text. How could Jason consider himself a victim? I'm still wondering aboout that. This book is an excellent example of how far people will go for money and fame(?). However, cheers to you Jason, for provoking me to the extent of writing this revue, and not managing my time well."
2,The author is a narcissist.,"The introduction of the book, written by the psychologist, talks about what a great guy Jason Moss is. In the body of the book, Jason goes on and on about how smart he is, how great his grades are, how good he is at wrestling, baseball etc. The book was much more about him and his achievements than it was about Gacy and Ramirez, and it certainly didn't give me any insights into the serial killers. I have been to Jason's website, and it also talks about how wonderful he is at everything he tries. After awhile it gets old."
1,The Last Victim : The True-Life Journey into the Mind of the,"This book, is nothing more than self serving tripe. It appears to be more of how great and smart the author is than anything else. Pure trash."
1,my wallet was the victim,"I went to the same high school as Jason, Green Valley, NV. My best friend's brother used to practice martial arts with Jason in his backyard. I bought his book out of curiosity and was bored to tears. Just like I remember from high school, in this book Jason seems self absorbed and narcistic. He is in constant pursuit of proving how talented and special he is to the reader. When I read the passage about how terrified he was when alone with Gacy I started laughing. Why? Because the thought of a muscular, strong, young Muy Tai martial artist who used to kick palm trees(for training his shins) being afraid of a fat old man was ridiculous. The motivations are obvious. Jason is from affluent, very upper-middle class america. He is a trained, skilled martial artist. Tons of embellishment for the reader and a waste of good money for me. Sorry Jason, I tried to read it objectively. Please no sequel."
3,When Horror and Porn Become One,"I love bad movies, but for some movies it is still hard to find its redeeming qualities. Mausoleum is one of those movies.Overall it is pretty bad. The acting is ok, the direction is [bad], and the story line is confusing and full of holes. But I can let all of that go because the lead actress is really hot and likes to get naked....A LOT.My girlfriend and I both enjoyed this movie, but maybe for the wrong reasons :) It is pretty cheesy but is surprisingly not that hard to sit through. I like it when she shows her demonically posessed side...which consists of a green light and her growling like a sick dog.This movie deserves 3 stars because it was somewhat enjoyable (i.e. I was able to sit through it), but mostly for the lead actress' fabulous body...definately not to be missed!!!"
3,Okay,"This is an okay horror movie, but had to watch it on my computer, would not play on my dvd player. Thanks"
4,Don't use much,"I have several paint scrapers for my current project. I thought with all the attachments I would get lots of use out of this one, but I think its better to probably just get one tool for each special application you have. The blades are ok, but I don't care for the angle of the blade to the handle. Maybe its just me but I don't ""go to"" this scraper first. Maybe your experience will be different. One thing I do like...it has a file stored into the handle for sharpening up your blades...so some guy was thinking on that one.Update 9.2010I had some rounded trim I needed to strip with KleanStrip. The contoured scraper on this tool worked great. No complaints. I upgrade from 3 stars to 4."
5,Essential Listening,"This disc will appeal not only to the dedicated world music afficianado, but will serve as a splendid introduction for the novice. I cannot recommend this highly enough.....in a collection of CDs that numbers in the thousands, this is truly a gem. Enjoy!!"
2,"Really liked Spin, really disliked this one.","By halfway through the book, I found myself skimming, and there were almost no characters I cared about. Of all the possible alternate realities they could have wound up in, why that one? I just found it dismal. Spin was much better. Two stars, maybe."
4,Brilliant but something missing.,"I'm a new fan of Robert Charles Wilson, having recently read and loved Darwinia. All the way through Mysterium I was gripped. It was so difficult to put down, especially the first 100 pages when the mystery first unfolds. Wilson is such a good writer that he even makes the goings on within the religious government readable. Right up until the last page I was totally gripped by this novel, which brings me to why I only award 4 stars. I simply felt that the story built up brilliantly to a big reveal that was not fully realized. I wanted so much more at the end of the book than what was explained.Definitely recommended though and I will be reading as much Wilson as I can get."
3,Interesting alt universe story reads like a sketch,"There are many things that work about this book and it's weaknesses are not particularly significant. The premise is compelling and fleshed out without as much action filler as Wilson's Spin series. The characters are a bit thin and the plot could be stronger, but they function reasonably as vehicles to explore a few possibilities suggested by gnostic thought and notions of parallel, seeded and propagated universes. These concepts are handled elegantly if somewhat superficially. The book is fairly short, fast read and I probably would have enjoyed it even more as a novella. Although this is not young adult fiction, it strikes me as what young adult fiction should be. Most of it is fairly easy to digest, but the deeper aspects are not contrived."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I found this at a used bookstore too. I hadn't heard of Robert Charles Wilson and boy! what a good book. He writes well and the plot about an alternate universe is intriguing. I kept thinking about the Dark Tower in Stephen King's mythos. I am going to see if the local library carries other of Wilson's works. I think he's definitely going to be somebody to pursue!I highly recommend this one. I couldn't put it down. And usuallly, I'm famous for buying cruddy books at the used bookstore. This one is a gem!"
4,Not Just for Episcopalians,"This humorous but deeply spiritual collection of stories in one man's walk of faith is truly inspiritng. My book group read it, and we all agree that it is a book to keep handy as the chapters stand as independent essays. Any Christians from liturgical faiths will relate to Keizer's journey. His insights into women and the church are enlightened."
4,International Fund Raising for Not-for-Profits,"An absolutely indispensable guide to the complexities of international philanthropy. Alumni relations, corporate contributions and international organization pros should have this tome on their desks before writing next year's strategic plan. Yes it is expensive! But, it should both save you money and potentially make an enormous impact upon your mission. Although it is a growing field, (in which I am a practitioner) international fundraising has very few seasoned professionals. Wiley should be congratulated in selecting the best person imaginable for this daunting work-in-progress.I found the definitions to be of value (although I do not always agree with some of the nuances) and quality of contributors to be first-rate. Sure, there a some weaknesses. But, as this is to be the first of several editions, it is bound to grow in value with each printing.Brion Battin Black bbblack@bellatlantic.net"
4,P2P how-to,"This book gives a comprehensive and short review of peer-to-peer technologies. This book is in a sense unique because:a) It is ""short"". That's not usual in books about the same subject.b) Gives implementation details (i.e. code)So, I recommend it in order to go away from the theoretical discussions... However, do not hesitate to check the web and try some test examples in python or perl [...]"
1,Can not play in US,These can not be played on US DVD players and the web site does not tell you that. I would not have purchased them if I had known that.
3,Some parts are good. some not so much.,The videos are pretty funny. The down fall is all the retakes and outtakes and bloopers are included with the series. So that takes away from the entertainment of the bloomers.
3,not able too view,did not know that this is a region 3 dvd and my amchine does not play itit was my fault for not reading and understanding sellerI will eventually get a play for it until then ????????
4,Great value for price!,"My adult son wanted a DJ style headphone for 2009 xmas, basically though for his mp3 player. Researched on web, and found high reviews for the JVC. I could not find locally, initially though found at a Amazon competitor, but for for full retail ($40, in itself not bad). Almost ordered, but then found same at Amazon, for $15 less!My son LOVES the headphone! Says very comfortable, lightweight, and sounds great....so far no issues, so at this point highly recommend!PS, as usually find with Amazon orders, was delivered as promised, and in time for the big day!"
3,"Attractive design, good pics, tiny plans","As soon as I read the opening sentence 'Throughout the twentieth century the house has commended itself as the most appropriate and responsive vehicle for testing ideas and expressing an architectural position in built form.' I was disappointed.And then, on page 18, ""The decorative elaboration can easily blind us to the imagination and discipline with which Macintosh's ideas were grounded in responses to patterns of use, and proved an embarassment to later critics.""Not my kind of book I'm afraid. Don't want to unravel all those sentences.Still, the pictures are nice, as is the overall design. A small floor plan will appear on every third page or so.Nothing new here, but the author's charm and wit add to his obvious mastery of the material, so I'm sure many will find this an enjoyable read."
4,A good read,"A very detailed book on not only the R-4360 but a range of other enginesand engineering designs. It is not a light read as it is aimed at themore technical minded, but it is a thorough and interesting book"
5,Good book,We had a hard copy my son gave us years ago and he wanted a copy so this worked out very well.
4,Just received my new brake pads,"I just received my new Pro ACt ultra premium Brake pads for my 2004 Chevy Malibu classic. I have not installed the pads yet but i will update my review here few months after i install the pads. I am excited that these brake pads lasts a long time and does not damage the rotors.I ordered the pads from another site because amazon does not carry the pads for my Chevy Malibu.In the box i received there was 4 brake pads, i am not a mechanic but i am guessing that the 4 pads are for the two front wheels only."
1,RWI America Wrong brake pads sent,Ordered Akebono ACT914 ProACT Ultra-Premium Ceramic Brake Pad Set. What I got was ACT564H in a taped box with clippings of correct item box inside but INCORRECT parts. I saw 2 other reviews with the same issue. I would love to hear from someone at Amazon why this has been allowed to continue. This order was shipped from RWI America. The invoice also indicates UPS shipping when actually was sent via US mail.
3,4 PADS IN ONE SET,"I've just received two sets of brake pads. Akebono ACT573 and ACT 914 ProACT. Before I placed the order, it was unclear from the descriptions of each of the products whether a set of pads comes with a pair or with two pairs of pads. Just so I wouldn't have to order it twice I ordered two sets of each. After I have received everything and opened the packages I saw that each set came with two pairs of pads - that is 4 pads in one set. I plan to return the extra sets.I have not installed the pads so have no review as to the quality - will post it once installed and driven for a couple of hundred miles.Also - the shipping was much faster than the anticipated timeline by Amazon."
3,Interesting compilation of anti-Communist propaganda,"As the title suggests, this book deals with propaganda aimed at fighting the ""Red Menace"" (i.e. communism). Starting with the beginning of the Soviet state and going all through the Cold War, the authors, using a tongue-in-cheek style, show the variety methods used in the US to get the anti-communist message across. These methods ranged from pamphlets and posters to magazine articles and comic books. The book's only serious problem is the downplaying of how much of a menace the communist world was (and still is in the case of North Korea and the other Red holdouts)."
1,Explain the Gulag,"This text is a concerted effort to trivialize the opposition to the ruthless totalitarian system that took more than 100 million lives. Documents now available show that Lenin created the police state, which was imitated by Mao and Pol Pot. Readers are advised to read Gulag Archipeligo to find out what Communism was.Barson and Heller would like us to forget the thousands of missiles created destroy not only America but the entire West"
2,"lugubrious, dreary","lugubrious, dreary, that about sums it up. Emmylou Harris and Willy Nelson are OK, the rest is, well, dreary.""Beautiful Dreamer"" with songs by Stephen Foster is much better."
2,XPW TV Finally Uncut (sort of..),"First off,let me say I am impressed with the video quality as the episodes look better than the butchered Big Vision dvds.That being said,they skip a HUGE chunk of Season 1 with no explanation as to why.The upside is more complete matches and episodes although the Big Vision dvds don't censor language as much as these episodes.It's hard being an XPW fan with all of the (sometimes)justified criticisms of wrestler talent and story lines and they constantly edit or leave matches unreleased.You will still need the Big Vision dvds to fill in the gaps if you don't have old VHS bootleg tapes of the show.Start Season One with Episode ONE! Another botched effort."
3,Decent,"A DVD worth buying if you can find a cheap price for it. If you're a fan of deathmatch style wrestling, you'll enjoy this DVD. Brutal spots throughout most matches, with the last match between Supreme and Vic Grimes being really violent. However, this is the only time that I can sit and watch an XPW event all the way through, as most of XPW is pretty bad at times.There are several segments in this DVD that bog it down, however. These include the Messiah vs. TOOL match (bad), Rob Black flapping his gums way too much, and an incredibly crappy opening match between Vic Grimes and Kraq.Also, if you want true deathmatch wrestling, check out all of the Tournament of Death DVDs from CZW (Combat Zone Wrestling). They slay everything that XPW ever dished out. Ever. Which is why CZW is still in business, while XPW went the way of the dodo."
1,utter junk,"Not even worth a look, it's horrid. XPW, do you even get what ECW was about? You have like 3 tallented Wrestlers and that's it.Awefull mic work, too."
4,A Guide to Strolling Beyond Tower Grove Park,"I've never been to Tower Grove Park in St. Louis, though after reading this book I feel I know it well. Robert Knittel reminds his readers of the joys and rewards of walking for pleasure, stopping to observe and breathe in details, taking detours recommended by a curious canine guide (the author's airdale Herb believes in taking the trails less traveled). In this fast-paced world, we need guides like this, which encourage us not to squeeze all the top sites into one frantic touring afternoon, but to savor and discover our most familiar surroundings through the seasons."
3,pillow cover,"There is a ""warning"" that the pillow case included with Bed Wedge would be a ""tight fit"". It proved to be impossible to insert the Bed Wedge into the case...period."
1,Worst Nora Roberts ever,"This is the worst Nora Roberts book I've ever read and I'm a huge fan. I guess she just got better after this one. It was basically soft porn - not much of a story line. Just a lot of leading up to sex, thinking about sex, and FINALLY having sex. I kept wishing they would just do it and get on with the story. Unfortunately, there wasn't much of a story."
4,"Treasures Lost,Treasures Found","I enjoyed this story, Nora Roberts one of my favorite authors. It kept my intrest from the begaining to the end. I recomend buying this book and any other of her books!"
3,Treasures Lost,"The story itself was weak,and it really didn't read like a Nora Roberts book. I would have liked more of a mystery and less descriptions of meanless things. I have been reading her books for 35 years and have enjoyed them. Her writing seems to be changing as to the relationships of characters and depth of the story."
3,My first Nora Roberts book,"Treasures Lost Treasures Found, on my kindle was a good book. However when I finished the book, another book started up that had nothing to do with the first book."
3,Disappointed,"I was waiting for this book to be published with much anticipation. However, I was very disappointed with the outcome. And, though I will give much credit to the author for researching the recipes and their cultural origins, the book was kind of a disappointment to me. Some recipes are repeated twice, with different ingredients, and some are like a summarization from the prized edition of the Time and Talents Club Cookbook. This is only MY humble opinion. However, for someone who needs a basic, simple insight into Parsi cooking, this will be a very good book. I liked the way the author has written a few descriptive lines before the recipes; and the simplicity of the text."
2,Not for my Mac,"It's an excellent book--unless you have a Mac. To my disappointment, I discovered very little useful info for ""the rest of us."" Tip to Mac users: before you purchase this book from Amazon, skim through a copy at your local bookstore and see if it's worth the price! Had I done that, I wouldn't have bought it. My fault."
5,Extracted a broken tap,I used this tool to remove a broken tap. It took about 20 minutes of wiggling back and forth but it then worked! That saved a very big repair.
5,No hosing here!,Strong and well made. The curve on the end were i put my strachments creates the perfect angle to use the broom function and the pet tool attachment. Great all around hose!
1,"Good Hose , but for one thing !",This hose is hard to use since neither end has a rotating connection . I honestly don't know why you would make one without it --- OH wait I know because you want to make it cheap . I quess I picked wrong this time .
1,"Just bushings, not links!","Site says these are full links. They are not. What I received was just the red poly bushings, some washers and nuts. No bolt or sleeve. On the positive side, Amazon refunded my money and let me keep the bushings!"
4,Better than the original Verizon case,"I like that the clip doesn't have to be on the case. It's not a perfect fit, but close enough. The original case was a more snug fit, but the clip on the back was not useful to me."
4,motorola case,really nice the only case i see has no problem when charging the only thing is ther should have been a black
2,Disappointing,This story of a man so close to Jesus could be a blockbuster film if it had the talent of those in hollywood to produce it. Anyone in the world who actually took the time to learn of his life and miracles would be transformed. We need some talent like Mel Gibson to proclaim his life to the world. This DVD makes it a complete bore. Sorry to say but it is the truth.
1,Padre Pio Sanctus,"This was an informative DVD but rather impersonal. I would have enjoyed it more if they had more first hand interviews and shown more photos of Padre Pio from his primary years to his Fiar years. I also feel this comantary could have gone into more about his hospital and the stuggle of financing it and those close to this project that helped to make it happen. This is a quick overview of the Padre and had landscape pictures, his bedroom, monestary while giving comantary. Not for hard core interested fans of this Saint."
1,padre pio,"i am very sorry but the product never arrived to my address, in lima peru.please help me to know what happen.best regardsalberto balducci"
2,Helpful but mistake-filled,"This book is really helpful to break words up into their latin roots, but the teacher's edition has a lot of mistakes."
2,Turn back now,"We're on our second year of using this book in our language arts class, and the general opinion of our class is that we all hate it. The book is ridden with mistakes, factual errors, fallacies, inconsistencies, and many of the same. It does do a little bit of help in defining words, but it definately does a lot of help in confusing our class. An example: what do you suppose the definition ""theory of last things"" means? Or how does a stem, mis, that was ""bad"" for a year and a half, suddenly become ""hatred""? Since when is ""Tango"" derived from the latin stem ""tang"" (it's not)? So, if you're looking for a textbook, try finding one that is less riddled with errors and helps the kids more."
4,Very Good,"As a sixth-grade student, I have been taught this in class. I found it very useful to be able to break down words into the basic roots. Not only can you learn about the origin of words, you can decipher what new words mean based on the roots and spell based upon the spelling of the roots. I highly suggest this book."
5,"An Amazing, Shocking Journal of the Balkan Conflict!","The man who wrote this book wrote from his heart, not merely his head. He gave insights that only a true 'survivor' of modern-day war could give. Beautifully written and powerfully emotional, this book is life-changing."
1,Very poor prints,"The prints of these short films are so bad you can't even see much of the action. They are terribly over exposed with lots of snow and rough edits. I have seen a few of these films on TCM and they were good quality, these are bootleg quality at best."
4,Love the item but don't forget to check...,"We have used the FunTainer for years for our kids..we get a NEW one each year for them. However, do REMEMBER to open the tops and make sure you have a rubber seal in the piece that you are buying. Our last bottle didn't have it and I couldn't understand why it was leaking as I've never had one leak. My problem is that I live overseas and I can't return it. Now, trying to get someone here to fix it or give me a replacement part.Otherwise, a fantastic product. keeps kids drinks cool or hot for hours. Kids love them too.ALso, I think there is something wrong with the prices here....I have always purchased them for about $15 at Target. Check the price before you buy.."
2,Breaks apart too easily,"I had about 4 of these cups at my house. At first I LOVED them. 2 weeks later my son dropped his from his car seat to the floor of the car and the lid exploded. One down. Next I was washing one BY HAND in sink and the bottom of the cup dropped off. I tried gluing it back on, no luck. It didn't look very safe without the bottom on it. Two down. Lid broke off the third one when my 5 year old pushed the open button a little hard. I have one cup left after having these Funtainers about 4 months.Yes, I have a contacted Thermos. NO warranty on the parts that broke and a replacement lid with shipping and everything is 7$. I got the cups at Target for 12$, so more than half of that for a lid that will probably break again. I will not be buying anymore thermos funtainers. They are too expensive to break so easily and with such little wear and tear. What a waste!"
5,This is not a toy.,Im not sure why the review is for a toy but.....This is the best break away knife available for artists and graphic designers. If you cut a lot of paper this is the knife to be using. I've had three that have been lost or stolen over the years and have used many other brands this is the best one. I work in a sign shop and keep this knofe in my pocket and use it everyday..
1,misrepresentation,There was no indication of any kind that the tunes on the cd were not by the original artists.Who actually performed on the cd I will never know and I dont want to know because they were terrible .Every tune was done by the same (er}PERFORMERS? This was supposed to be an anniversary gift for my wife because we met during the 1980's so this cd was quite a disappointment.Then of course there was the major inconvenience of returning the product to Britain. Returning anything to Britain from Canada is not a simple matter but I will spare you the details.
2,Looks Cooler in the Photo,"I really wanted to get this for my active hamster, hoping it would give her something else to explore instead of begging to be out of her cage all the time. I finally bought it, and its been a disappointment. It didn't come with assembly instructions like CritterTrail's cages, and I still haven't figured out how to get it to attach to the lid of the cage so that the tube is stable. (I'm talking about the tube inside the cage.) The first time my hamster checked it out, it moved on her, and I think it spooked her; I've not seen or heard her in it since. I'm hopeful she'll come back to it, because I'd hate to think I spent this money for nothing when I could have used it something more interesting for her! This would appear to one of those ""it was better at the store"" purchases."
2,Not very stable,"It looks more fun than it ended up being in practice.We were using the CritterTrail 2 cage (from the same manufacturer), so we expected a decent level of compatibility, but the pieces never seemed to fit together quite right. Our hamster did sleep up in the circular section a few times, but I was so uneasy about the possibility that it'd fall over one day (and either injure the hamster or permit her to escape) that I finally decided to just remove it entirely.It's possible that we set it up wrong, but directions were absent (and there was no explanation on the manufacturer website either) so we were just doing whatever looked like it was how it was probably meant to fit."
3,"Cute, but not stable",I had to put folded up paper around the tube where it connects to the cage because it isn't a tight fit. My cage is the same brand so should be compatable but I'm not impressed.
4,Nice Accessories,This was a good choice. My daughters hamster (Sniffers) really likes the look out tower. I wouldn't change a thing. I would recommend this to anyone.
2,Gerbils love to eat it,I gave this and a similar structure to my nieces for their gerbils. They lasted slightly more than two weeks because the gerbils ate the connectors!
5,Endless Fun for Hammies,Terrific price for so many pieces -- I work at a pet store and could not purchase this item there as cheaply! My hammies love to explore these tunnels and I can change out the layout often to keep them from getting bored.
4,Loop-d-Loop Accessory Kit 2,"Works fine. Very easy to assemble, a tad hard to disassemble (I use a spoon). Got if for my daughters 8th dirthday, she loved it along with some tubes to add to the fun. The hamster loves them as well she sleeps in one of them all the time. Easy to clean I just shake them out and the one that the hamster sleeps, eats, and pees in I simply spray it out at the sink and allow to air dry before replacing it."
4,Loop - d - loop,The main component works well. When adding the second section the item becomes very top heavy and tilts. Hamster has started using it as his sleeping area.Use the second component with the bubble as an exercise ring. Turn it different directions to make it challenging.
4,My hamsters love this!,"I bought this with CritterTrail Fun-nel assorted tubes, and connected them together to form a maze. My hamsters love them, they stayed inside for eating, exploring, and resting. Too bad they fight when they meet, otherwise I will use the tubes to connect their cages and create a much complex maze to let them explore."
3,worth it for all the tubes,"This buy is definetly worth it to have all the extra tubes, the problem here is the connectors. When using the cheap connectors the heavier tubes like the ""loop-d-loop"" tube, arent sturdy at all, so i'm gonna have to invest in some of those habitrail locking connectors to be able to use this well."
4,Why the champs wear their belts...,This event was proof positive of why the champs are the champs. Both title fights are a showcase of why the champions deserve all the accolades that they can get. Both made it look REALLY easy. All in all this was a very good event to watch. Buy this DVD!!
1,Terrible/10,Just terrible and not worth the money. The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill. Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.
2,"It's ok, but needs a few improvements...","I was excited to finally get a good portable collection for the PSP, but after trying a few games, I was very disapointed. When playing 1942, the default screen size is too small. Sure, you can strectch it out, but then the graphics are slightly out of ratio. 1942 also runs too fast. It probably runs almost twice as fast as the original which makes it too hard to play. This complaint applys to every shooter in this collection. Sidearms is another classic that I was excited to see, but this version runs too fast and you can hardly survive long at all. The fighters are better. I would say three wonders is the best. Nice color and runs well. If your buying this for the shooters, don't bother. If you like the fighting games and platform stuff, then you may like this. Overall, it just didn't capture that spirit I was looking for. If the programmers would of only scaled the processor speed for this collection, it would of made all the difference in the world."
1,Save your money,"I thought it would be cool to ""re-live"" the past and play some of these old titles. I was wrong. The games are not sized to the screen of the PSP and some are so small you can't even really see them."
5,"For a great sport management foundation, read and learn this","I am a junior at the University of Massachusetts, and I had the opportunity to read and study this book for my Sports Management class this past spring. It was a great experience and served as a great foundation for my education in the sport management field. The book touched upon every aspect in which a sport management professional in one capacity or another may be inclined to deal with. Principles and Practices of Sport Management by Lisa Pike Masteralexis was easy to read and comprehend. At the same time, the book was informative and challenges the reader to constantly keep an open mind to the different areas of sport management. Marketing, promotions, facility management, legal issues, historical facts and event management are just some of the topics one will read about in this highly recommended guide to successfull sports management."
4,This house doesn't clean itself!,"Gosh.. my husband is wonderful, but soooo sloppy!! I wish this title were different. I put a sticker over the title in case my husband found it. I labeled it ""Helping My Wonderful, Adorable, Clueless Husband understand How to Help Me Out Around the House"" He found the book and was still a little insulted, but I have noticed a difference in how I talk to him about what I need and he seems to want to try harder to help. This book helps you communicate your needs without insulting your husband. Only problem is.. the title is insulting. Needs a new title!!"
3,Why is it always our responsibility?,"I think this book is helpful, but frankly until women stop putting up with the role we trap ourselves into, men will always resist until we use our charms and sweet ways to convince them to do what every adult male or female should do. The responsibility for adult living should be squarely on both partners -- I refuse to be 100% responsible for everything. Mind you, that may be the breaking point -- I don't blame men for sitting around if we are willing to tiptoe and dance around. We have not come very far at all.... So very sad...."
1,Disturbance...,"This is the eighth book tht I've read from Goines and by far, the most disturbing. Had I read this book first, I would've never picked up another. It's not that he's a bad writer because he is really really good (great dialogue, great plots, intriguing characters when he diversifies them), but all his topics drain me out. Reading about a rape for about sixty percent of the book should drain the average person out. Reading about a situation where the father is murdered is one thing, but the two men in her life turtle-walking to revenge is another. I don't even understand what Goines expects to accomplish with this book besides upsetting people. Not one positive thing came from this book and I know all books don't necessarily have happy endings, but I didn't even learn anything from this book. Then again, none of the other books did either, so why am I surprised? I've had enough of reading this author!"
3,Yeah it's disturbing,"I wasn't too crazy about this one. Goines usually sets his stories in the inner-city, but he decided to go into the swamps of Mississippi for this one. George(Swamp Man) watches his little sister get brutally raped at the hands of some white boys, and he slowly plots his revenge. Some of the scenes in the book will disturb you. I've read all 16 of his books, and this was the last I read and thought I had read it all until I read this."
2,Definately Not Donald,"After reading this book, it seems to me that Donald only wrote this one for money. It is not nearly up to his usual level of writing or story-telling. While advertised as being a book about ""rape, murder and revenge"", mostly it is about what is going on the the young protagonist's mind while he is tracking down and shooting the men who raped his sister.I only gave the book two stars because I know, Donald's fans will be disappointed by this one.C. Melcher"
5,OUTSTANDING!,"This book is one of the most interesting books I have ever read! I could not put it down, I read it in one day! The best part about this read is that it is set in the sixties and most people my age are not aware of what went down on the farm lands. Most certainly a must have for Donald Goines fans!!!!!!!"
3,"Starts well, finishes ok.",This book is gretty and likeable like alot of his books. To summarize it really wuick. It starts off well and very detailed. However it ends with no real conclusion. Not that it was supposed to however it just came off really quickly and the last chapter seemed to have been written rather quickly and seemed too unreal and cliche compared to the opening to midway between the book.
4,A great starter kit for beginners,"If your just starting a CD collection, I highly recommend these double CDs from England. You get to skim the Greatest Hits of Bowie, Queen, U2, Duran Duran, Culture Club, Roxy Music and dozens more. But if you've been buying music for a while, these CD's are a disappointment, skipping many of the more obscure one-hit wonders for superstars.As you might note, American acts are largely ignored in this (and many other in ""The Millennium Edition"" series) although there is a touch of Motown included.But rest assured, the tracks listed are the full-length editions of the singles by the original artists. If you lost your record collection in a fire, this is a good place to start building."
3,Nice product but the Cell phone clip broke quickly,Pretty cool product. Filled a need I had and then some. Thought it was the dream product until the cell phone attachment failed. The rest is pretty good though but can't give better than ***.
2,animals for children,"This would be a pretty good book for junior highschoolers. although it is lacking in literary value. This remarkable, true story of a circus elephant and her bond to humans could be illuminated by some scientific analysis; the composition would become more readable with skilled editing."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This book was like a bad movie that you don't walk out of because you want it to get better, you hope that it will make sense in the end. C'mon, I can suspend my disbelief with the best in order to enjoy a good story. It was obviously a work of fiction-- badly written fiction. The author didn't research basic facts about Asian elephants or Indian culture. The eroticism was clumsy and gratuitous. The spiritual references were ridiculous if not insulting. A fifth grader could have proofread it better: there are numerous mispellings/typos and grammatical mistakes. Helfer apparently wasn't assigned an editor at all as evidenced by the inconsistencies. Why would anyone sail from Germany to New York by way of India? How do you ship an elephant from India to New York on the deck of a small sailing vessel? Fortunately, I bought the book used, but I wouldn't recommend it if someone gave it to you!"
2,"Great story, lousy writing","While this book does have a fascinating and heart-rending story, the writing was so bad I could hardly wade through it. The author should have made up his mind if he wanted to write a nonfiction bio of the protagonist and his elephant or a novelization of their story. I don't appreciate ""true stories"" being full of detail that the teller OBVIOUSLY could not have witnessed or heard verbatim from one of his sources (like the sex scenes between Bram and his South Asian girlfriend...?). The author should have stuck to the facts and left out the sappy stuff and made-up dialogue; the story of this remarkable elephant and her handler is strong enough to stand on its own."
2,Entertaining Fiction,"This is a fast, easy read. It is also -- I am convinced -- complete fiction. The writing feels like it's fifty years old at least, rather than a mere decade. It's clunky and too often infected with the breathless prose of a bad romance novel. As others who were not captivated by the book have noted, it's all downhill after wonderful picture on the cover."
5,Modoc Review,"I have never been so emtoionally touched by a true story (and fictional) as this! I read it on a trip and could not stop crying (happy and sad)! I have been telling my family, friends, aquaintances, and even my veterinarian (after seeing an elephant picture in the waiting room) about this book -- in other words, I can't stop talking about it! The life journey of Bram and Modoc, which spans 70 years, is simply amazing! Went on line to read more and found out Kevin Costner is negotiating to direct and star in making Modoc into a movie! I will be the first in line!!!!!!!!"
3,Interesting story,"This was a good book, easy to read by people of all ages. There are some amazing life struggles depicted very well..."
2,"A Disappointment, to say the least.","What a disappointment to get into this ""true story"" and discover it is a fictionalized account written on young adult level, with some graphic human and elephant sex thrown in towards the latter part of the book. It is a childish and silly piece of writing. Don't bother with it. It is below standard. However, I did learn that this female Indian elephant had ""long glorious tusks"" that are (for some reason) totally invisible in her photos."
5,Great Read We passed it around the family to everyone,"Modoc was given as a Christmas present to my sister. It became everyones present because we all read it and loved it. We now have a very well worn edition that somebody borrowed and did not return so we are ordering a 2nd book for our permanent collection.We now have an expression around our house when reading a really good book we call it ""Having a Modoc Moment"" Another words completely enjoying a book.There is not anyone I have met that has read this book and not been touched by it"
5,"AMAZING, WONDERFUL!!!! You must read this!","Let me just start off by saying if you only read one book, read this one. Modoc's story will touch your heart. It makes you laugh, cry, fear, and love. This book is an experience. It is a special gem that glows and resonates brightly through the piles of ""great books"". It is not a great book, it is above and beyond that....words can not describe the beauty of MODOC"
1,Another skeptical reader,Not only is this book badly written but if this is a true story than I am Batman !Also look well at the pictures of Modoc : there are no tusks as described in the book and if you look well you might see that those are pictures of at least two elephants: look at the details of the ears...
1,Piffle,"""Modoc: The True Story of the Greatest Elephant That Ever Lived"" is pablum.Helfer is a hack and the story is a fake.I would recommened it to children from 8-12 as that is the level it is written on. I cannot do that though as it has two or more objectionable scenes of adult nature. One is of a bull elephant mating. It is graphic, disturbing and jarring to the story line.One wonders about the integrity of HarperCollins the book's publisher. Why bill a story so patently fake as a 'True Story'?I finished the book in one day. Why? Sometimes it's fun to see how bad bad writing can be.HarperCollins and Ralph Helfer ask the reader to believe them so that they may lie and make a buck."
5,Great Books,If you are not an Elephant lover you will be after your read this book and if you have an Elephant lover in your life buy them this book. It will make you cry and laugh.
2,Modoc...A boring yet outlandish tale that is not especially well written,"Modoc may have been an amazing elephant, but that doesn't mean that his story is worth reading. This book is poorly written. It is filled with melodramatic situations that are completely unbelievable...in the negative sense. It is intended to constantly pull your heartstrings, but it is too hard to suspend disbelief because the characters and the plot-lines are so poorly developed. I am amazed to read others statements that they cried reading this book- the characters are so one-dimensional that it is hard to care what happens to them, and I am pretty soft-hearted and cry easily. This book was our book club selection, and I would not recommend it to others. I am surprised that this book was published, due to the poor quality of the writing and character development."
5,great,I loved Water for Elephants but liked the story of Modoc even better. Shed alot of tears. Great book for the Greatest Elephant.
3,Modoc,It would have been GREAT if it were a true story...but I do not think it is a true story. Not even an embellished true story.
1,Not worth reading,"If you enjoy non fiction animal stories or circus stories that are well written, this is not the book for you. Many others have commented on the dreadful dialogue and unbelievable events. Instead, I recommend Alex and Me by Dr. Irene Pepperberg if you want a great, moving account of training an animal."
5,Amazing Story,I just read this for the first time yesterday with my daughter.This is an amazing story with beautiful illustrations by Ted Lewin.A wonderful book!
4,"If it's true, then it's amazing.","Modoc is a good story for adults to share with children, a touching tale of trans-species love."
1,"Too much poetic license, not enough facts","An over-romaniticized tale, lacking in basic facts. I've read many accounts of American circus history, and the author has obviously taken liberties with his story, while omitting details of dates and location. One example: a photograph lacking a caption or source data would link Modoc with the great circus fire of Hartford, Conn., yet Hartford is never mentioned in the account of the fire depicted in the book, and the actions attributed to Modoc and Bram are incongruous considering the facts of the fire. (See ""The Circus Fire"" by Stewart O'Nan) This book is an obvious attempt by Hefler to promote ""affection training,"" and while this is perhaps a worthwhile cause, his method defrauds the American circus of its history."
1,"padded with meaningless dialogue, reads like fiction","Much of the book is imagined dialogue between the elephant trainer and various characters. The relationships with parents, girlfriend and elephant are unrealistically idealized. The theme is pantheism and the trainer even assumes he was also an elephant in another life. I was not even able to finish this book."
3,Odd combination of juvenile and adult style,"If you like elephants, you'll like this ""true"" story, but may be put off by some of its silly elements. The author thinks the sound of a calliope is ""oom pah pah."" Also that x-rays were available in a hospital in India...in 1912, and that WWI era biplanes carried machine guns...on their WINGS, among other anachronisms. If not for the sex and the violent episodes, it would be a great kid's book."
3,"Good story, badly written","This story is a really nice one, but it's written at about fourth or fifth grade level. I started enjoying the book more when I started thinking of it as a children's book so that the lack of sophistication of the style would stop bothering me so much. But then there were scenes where the content would most certainly not be in a book for fifth graders, so while thinking of it as a kids book helped me enjoy it more, I don't think it was really intended to be for kids.It's a good story. Hopefully someone will tell it in a more artful way someday."
4,Not true but beautiful,"Huge motor vehicles -""rigs"" circa 1910? Camera tossed onto modoc's back while out with Gertie in the German countryside not ten years afterward? These are poor circus workers even if the timeline were shifted forward 20 years.... Many many problems like this in this book- not the least of which is that they describe Modoc's tusks- and the photos show a bunch of shots with NO tusks! Hints that we have been hoodwinked and this indeed is mostly pure fiction. Now I am even doubting any of this happened in any form. I am angry now because I take historical fiction seriously in a way I would not take this had i known it is fiction!"
5,I loved this book!!,"It is a wonderful, amazing spiritual story about the oneness of us all as experienced between a boy and an elephant. This book is a gift and I highly recommend it to everyone!"
4,Modoc: True story of the greatest elephant on earth,This is a well written account of a long life and relationship of a boy and his elephant. There are enough adventures and touching moments to keep a wide variety of readers engaged.Becky
1,"Love the cover, skip the text.","With one of the most captivating covers I've seen in a long time, the book went downhill once I opened the book. As much as I wanted to believe the story I found it more inventive and it raised more doubt than empathy in my mind. I do believe Modoc existed and there must be a wonderful story to tell but the writer missed his opportunity when he doused his writing with new age philosophy and dialoge out of a 1960's sit-com. I was very disappointed as I respect elephants and wanted to believe what I read as true. White elephant in the jungle? I don't think so. The only white elephant is the writing itself. Perfect for young readers well below the age of fifteen."
1,"A ""True"" Story?","This story purports to be true, and, undoubtedly, some of it is. But how much? And what? Much of the material is obviosly fictionalized, as when the author reports verbatim conversations that he was not a party to, and, obviously, nobody transcribed. The situation isn't helped by the author's failure to provide any dates, his vagueness about places, and his failure to account for large periods of Modoc's life, or her trainer's.As several reviewers have noted, the author is no literary stylist. The writing can be embarassingly bad. The New Age philosophizing shows little depth--the reader is told, for example, that one must walk through the valley of life, and that the past is a source of strength.Too bad. The author is obviously a caring, compassionate man, who loved Modoc deeply. But that does not qualify him as a writer or thinker. The reader is ultimnately left with a sense of his emotions being toyed with because of the impossibility of sorting out truth from fiction."
2,Agreed,"I love animals, elephants and a good animal story. However, this ""true"" story is over the top. It's so unbelievable, that even if it weren't marked as ""true,"" the utter absurdity and impossibility of events that take place would give a reader pause. I might let the absurd events pass if the writer was a good writer. Stilted prose, boring passages and silly dialogue litter this book.This book is more or less an advertisement for Helfer's style of training, which is now the acceptable style of training. I commend him for being on the forefront of humane treatment of animals, but perhaps he should stick to training and leave the writing to writers."
5,A wonderful heartfelt story about an amazing animal.,"Modoc is an amazing story for people of all ages. It is a very easy story to read. I was able to finish it in one sitting but was unable to keep a dry eye throughout the book. If you can look past proper documentation, as this seems to be the book's greatest critisicm, you will truly enjoy a wonderful story. It will make you think differently about animals and their feelings."
4,An amazing story for animal lovers!,"This is a true tale of the amazing journey of one elephant - Modoc. This book will enthrall you, amaze you, enrage you, charm you and make you want to read more! It is a story of friendship, love and courage!"
1,Mediocre Fiction,"If this story were real, the book would be an amazing revelation, and that's why I bought the book. However, I will admit to feeling duped when I realized that it was a novel. In fact, I lost interest and put it down. I read up to the part where the elephant rescued the crew after the hurricane and the writing was mediocre for a novel, written in what another reviewer said was a ""fairy-tale"" style. It makes a good children's picture book. And that's what I ended up getting from Amazon, thinking I was getting the story as reviewed. So I gave the children's book to a friend with grandkids and bought the paperback in a bookstore. Amazon only has it on Kindle. This book is not as advertised."
1,Run from this book!,Poorly written childish account that reeks of fiction parading as fact.Even the author's sorry disclaimer about his difficulty gathering facts cannot make up for the idiotic language and melodramatic situations inadequately fleshed-out and boring.I am only halfway through reading this hodgepodge and probably won't finish it.It is insulting to the reader and any of the supposed real characters described in it.Save your money.
5,Great Musical Fun!,"I bought this for my Granddaughters 3rd birthday. She loves listening to her music and singing along in the microphones.The second microphone makes sharing a song with a friend hassle free and fun. It is safe,durable and so easy to operate she can use it without help. I'm sure she will be enjoying this for years to come. GREAT PRODUCT!"
2,Very Disappointing!!!,Received as a gift for Xmas. I agree. Does not amplifiy your voice at all. My girls and others try to make it louder by putting it in their mouths. Now it doesn't work at all. Very disappointing!
1,This is Garbage!,"I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift and it stopped working almost as soon as it was turned on. I pushed play and the song started. It didn't even make it through one 3 minute nursery rhyme before crapping out, it just stopped playing. I thought it could be the CD so I tried several different CD's only to have the toy read the number of songs on each disc and still not play, pressed play each time and got an error message instead of music. I also tried replacing the batteries which didn't work either. I would not by this simply because it's obviously not a reliable toy. VERY dissapointing for my son and me considering the cost of this toy and now the hassle to return it."
1,Don't waste your money,"The mics on this toy don't amplify your voice at all. This isn't really a karoke item as much as a ""pretend"" karoke player. I'm not expecting studio qualuty, but you won't be able to hear your child's voice through the toy.I can't believe they would sell such a piece of junk."
1,"no voice amplification, need to return","Although there are two volume knobs, one for music and one for the mic. The music volume controls both mic and music and you can never hear your voice over the music. I hope this is just a defect with this unit, but I'm not looking forward to the return process."
1,Never Worked.,"This toy never worked properly from the moment we opened the box. The microphones didn't work and the sound was terrible. It needed a power cord, too. My kids never played with this because the most fun part of it (the microphone) was defective."
2,"Cute, while it lasted.","Thought I would avoid getting a piece of junk and I plunked down over $50 for this CD player after reading the reviews of all products that I could find in this particular catergory. It was cute when we got it and my son loved the portability. We quickly realized that we would have to go with an adapter because the thing drained batteries quickly. Less than 5 months after he opened the CD player it completely quit playing CDs.The microphones are really not great amplifiers either, but they were cute enough to pretend with.I'd say don't waste your money on this one, but there aren't many other choices for kid CD players. Someone needs to take hold of this market and make something that is durable. Or maybe, we'll move toward an MP3 players next..."
3,Broke in a week,I got this for my 21/2 year old and it was broke in less than a week. She loved it the time that it worked.
3,Microphones don't work,"I wanted a CD player with a microphone, so my toddler could sing along. This one has two microphones, so I thought that would be GREAT, so he and his sister could both sing, instead of fighting over it. Trouble is, the microphones don't seem to work at all.But it's a cute little portable CD player. Not sure about durability since we just received it."
2,Dissapointed,I have bought many flavors from Torani and this is the first one I did not like. It taste weirId and nothing like mango.
5,Great shoe !,This shoe molds nicely to your feet. I cannot bend over to get any other type shoe on. This allows me to just slide my foot in and go. This is my 2nd pair and I will buy this shoe again.
3,Not as good as Birkenstock,"These shoes were uncomfortable, not nearly as comfortable as the comparable shoe in birkenstock. The footbed is not quite the same."
1,not the real thing,i bought these for inside the house use. cheap imitation of the real Birkenstock's. buckle stapled on shoe. cheap junk. don't waste your money on these cheap imitation shoes. i wasted my money.
4,Double order,I received a double order and both returns were handled very well. I probably wouldn't order shoes again on line but I was not disappointed with the seller and how they handled the returns. The product by the way appeared to be a quality product.
4,A good Dummies book,"Read the title! This is not an HTML book. If you are hoping to be able to code your first web site after reading this book, you might struggle a bit.This is a decent book on how to construct a web site. As with most ""Dummies"" books the explanations seem to drag. However, I have found that they can be a good introduction to a subject, if the reader is truly ""in the dark"".If you have never written any type of computer program, or if you struggle with using your computer, and are still set on creating your own web page (go for it; they aren't that tough) buy this book and ""HTML for Dummies"". The combination of the two will get you up and running."
1,Completely outdated!!,"I purchased this book in October 2003 and, even though I was a total beginner, I quickly realized that it is completely out of date!! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK TODAY. This book was published in October 2000, and web programming and publishing programs have evolved so much since that there is barely anything relevant in this book anymore. After some further research, I decided that the best way for me to build my website was to learn one of the 'HTML visual editor' programs, and I purchased a recent book on DreamweaverMX which has all I need."
1,A disaster - save your money,"This is the worst Dummies book I've yet read and am seriously irritated that I didn't spend more time browsing its contents. This book is essentially an amalgamation of shameless promotion with just enough filler between the sponsors to afford this giant pop-up ad the euphemism ""book.""The author spends the majority of the book telling you to go elsewhere for tools and content. On hindsight, a great idea! Just save the money you're contemplating wasting on this drivel.Another major problem is that the website you'll end up with will, in all likelihood, look hopelessly outdated. I'm still searching for a good book on web publishing that isn't technical (I'm not going to learn code!)."
2,Old & Tired Information,"This information is so old that it's not of much use. I'm not an expert web site designer, but I found this book practically useless. Better to use iWeb, with their lovely templates and ease of use."
1,really for dummies?,"If it were for dummies it would have been straight to the point more of a step by step without words you have to look up and comentary that takes you off course, best advice i ever heard didnt come from this book but its, K.I.S.S. aka Keep It Simple Stupid which this book did not"
5,Rich resource for understanding Hebrews,"I don't write many reviews, but I had to at least comment on this Hebrews commentary. Mr. Guthrie is a fantastic writer. His insights on the text are not overly technical but will serve the needs of the average biblical student. Where this text really shines is in his application. Guthrie is obviously a voracious reader and his application sections quote a wide range of resources. I have been moved time and time again by his arguments and application of the text. Teaching through the book of Hebrews has been both personally enriching and incredibly challenging, and I am weekly fed by this resource. If you are a student of the great book of Hebrews, please do yourself a favor and get this book. You may not always agree with his exegesis, but you will be touched by his application and challenged to live out your faith in the king-priest Jesus."
3,A pretty good 70's cop flick.,"John Wayne tries to be Dirty Harry, even down to a ""signature gun"", in this case the Ingram MAC-10 machine pistol.For a Wayne movie, its very hard on ""the System"", showing corrupt cops and cops who just don't give a damn about justice. Good performance by Eddie Albert as a PO'd police captain, half the time you think his head is going to explode off his shoulders!Fantastic stuntwork at the end, making the slow spots worth the effort."
3,MCQ,"GOOD OLD JOHN WAYNE, THIS MOVIE WAS OK BUT NOT AS GOOD AS BRANNIGAN WHICH HAD MORE ACTION AND OOMPH WITHIN THE STORYLINE STILL ANOTHER J.W MOVIE TO MY INCREASING COLLECTION."
2,The Duke's Got to Know His Limitations,"An aging John Wayne looks uncomfortable emulating Clint Eastwood in this routine crime thriller. Released two months after ""Magnum Force"" blew away the box office, ""McQ"" (1974) has its virtues - notably director John Sturges' penchant for slam-bang action sequences and Wayne's strong chemistry with Colleen Dewhurst (who makes the most of her disappointingly small role). Still, the Duke fared better when he took his cop routine to London in ""Brannigan"" (1975)."
5,great,The Duke is the best!Hard to believe he is gone.What an actor. Like him in modern well so called modern roles
4,The duke,Can you really go wrong with the best actor that ever lived? The movie is kind of cheesy like most cop movies from the 70's but John Wayne gives another great performance and the story line aint bad.
3,John Wayne Action in a Crime Story,"This is a different role for John Wayne. He plays a policeman in a modern (at the time it was made) metropolitan police force. When several officers are killed, including an old friend, he goes on the case. His methods are rather direct in a no-nonsense, John Wayne sort of way. Needless to say, he hacks off the brass and resigns from the force. That doesn't mean that he resigns from the force, however. He just carries on as a private investigator. What he finds shocks his sensibilities. Corruption runs amuck in the underworld, the force and even among friends.This is by no means a great John Wayne action picture. It does, however, hold its own and hold interest. Wayne, as usual, take the high moral ground and refuses to compromise on what he believes to be right. That means the bad guys are going to have a bad day."
4,"not his best but ""mcq"" still shows wayne fighting the good fight","i love john wayne movies and while ""mcq"" isn't one of my picks as his best it still is good. wayne is lon mcq a good cop who is a little long in the tooyh but still ready to fight bad guys no matter which side of the law their on. after his pal is killed and he nearly is he hunts the people down and finds bad cops selling drugs they are takeing from drug dealers. well mcq won't stand for that and the movie is off . not great but any john wayne beats most other movies hands down. enjoy!!!"
4,JOHN WAYNE WITH MAGNUM FORCE,"There is a rumour that John Wayne turned down DIRTY HARRY, but that movie's director Don Siegel in an interview rebukes that claim. However Big John got his chance to play a ""Dirty Harry"" type cop in this above average 1974 police corruption thriller filmed on the gritty streets of Seattle (long before Frasier appeared on the scene).Det. Lon McQ (Wayne) investigates the murder of his police officer buddy and comes up against all sorts of obstacles. A great scene sees the Duke almost squashed to death in his car between two trucks. The end delivers a surprise that you won't see coming, and John Wayne (though old and paunchy clearly looks as though he's enjoying a change of role from his usual Westerns).Well recommended, John Wayne followed this movie with a more tongue-in-cheek cop movie a year later called ""Brannigan""."
4,Wayne as an action Hero,"Great movie for John Wayne fans! Please note: His ""Green Hornet"" is a Pontiac Firebird! Not a Camaro!"
4,A Very Good 70s Crime Film,"This ""Dirty Harry"" inspired crime film is quite enjoyable if you can handle Wayne as a tough cop that drives a trans-am. The first twenty-five minutes of this film are fast-paced excellent suspense, but as the film progresses there are quite a few boring moments, but there is enough tigh-paced suspense and action in this film to make it a winner.See it!"
5,What does Leverton know?,"This movie is one of the Duke's best. Reviewers like James D. Leverton like to pick films apart, pointing out all the politically incorrect stuff. He was offended by a spanking joke in I Love Lucy. Wayne's step into the 70's ""detective with an attitude"" genre is fantastic. By the way, the DVD is not far off."
1,MQ 'MQ'uits before it gets started,"Believe it or not, John Wayne was once considered for the role of 'Dirty Harry Callahan' (it, of course, went to Clint Eastwood). It seems The Duke sort of regreted his decision because he leaped at the chance to do MQ. It is painfully obvious that MQ is a 'Dirty Harry knockoff'(John Sturges even directed a Clint Eastwood flick or two!). The producers just substituted Seattle (without the Space Needle) for San Francisco and Wayne's souped-up sportscar for the .44 Magnum. The rest of the cast look bored (wait--Diana Muldaur always looks like that) with the sterile sets, bad 70's dialog, and horrid music. And you'll be bored too if you bother with MQ."
1,The DVD I never received,The DVD I never received and have no idea when I will receive any notice of what happened.
1,70's cop claptrap with minimal real action,"An aging miscast Duke lumbers through this thing with his bad toupee looking woodenand bored. There is little real action with a poor script and run-of-the-mill dialogue.I remember this on TV as a kid and I wasn't impressed back then either. Might be mildlyinteresting to see the great Colleen Dewhurst and Al Lettieri whose talents are certainlywasted here. Notable for introducing audiences (and criminals) to the MAC-10 submachine gunwhich the Duke saves for the final scene after a lame car chase on the beach. A few scenesof old Seattle and dull 70's interiors will provide minimal interest for those with an eyefor design, otherwise for diehard Duke fans only."
1,John Wayne Was A Racist!,Sorry but the so-called duke sux! Always have! No surprise here...I hate john wayne like I hated Ronald Reagan punk self!
2,Bad undercard!,"The undercard for this event in quite terrible, no good fights untill Kaos vs. New Jack, and thats only good after the match ends and GQ Money comes out.The only really good match on the disc in the exploding ring deathmatch between Grimes and Supreme, but even this match has its flaws. Unlike the infamous Terry Funk, Cactus Jack exploding ring deathmatches, the explosives are next to the beds of barbed wire and not under them, so really it just looks like a fireworks display next to the wrestler when they land on them. So you have to ask yourself is one really good match worth the $...+ you have to pay for this disc? The DVD comes with these extras, match histories and a XPW ""best of"" video clip which is pretty cool."
1,This is Horrible!,"I've only seen one video and it was horrible. This is not evenwrestling.They say there better than ECW (Extreme Championship Wrestling)yeah right,I'll belive that when I see it. Don't wasteyour money on Rob Black's company. If you want to buy somethingextreme get EC f'n W."
5,More Peter Egan... 'nuff said.,"Love Peter Egan's writing! Leanings [1] wasn't enough, so I bought the second. Both great books that kept me entertained and laughing for hours. In fact, I may need to re-read them both this winter!"
2,common error,"I enjoy Peter's articles in general however, not very far into the book, he made some strong left wing comments that took me right out of his story. It so colored my impression of him that I did not enjoy the next story and gave away the book.Writers and other entertainers need to understand their audiences. The country is split politically almost 50/50 and when you make hard edged political remarks you are going to upset half your potential paying public. My motorcyle group has over 9000 members and the vast majority are conservatives and that is not unusal for motorcyclists. If one wants to sell a product to such an audience, you might want to keep that in mind. He is certainly entitled to his views, but they were interjected into a story where they were not reqired. I was disappointed."
5,Proficient Motorcycling book by David Hough,"I already own a copy of this book, as well as it's companion. I think so highly of them that I have ordered this copy to be used as a gift/prize at an upcoming motorcycle club gathering. Every motorcyclist should read and study this book. I try to re-read it a couple times a year. I'm still learning things from it, and being reminded again of others, all of which are very important and valuable information to me. I've been riding for about 40 years, and this is the most useful and worthwhile motorcycle book I own!"
5,great item,I have loved this show from the time i first started watching it...and getting to watch all the shows at once has made a very good impression on me..i love British comedys and i love this..well worth the money
5,Awesome!,"I used to watch this on PBS, and I am so very happy to have it at my disposal now! I wish there were more seasons! VERY satisfied."
4,how to have it all..by Mrs. fforbes-hamiltonDevere,I bought this series for my father but i must admit i was quickly hooked myself. The language is a little hard to understand at times and the video is a little grainy but all in all a fun show to watch. The lead characters Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles have great chemistry and the rest of the cast is enjoyable also. You really believe she is the lady of the manor and the rest are just along for the ride. Good viewing for everyone.....
5,Timeless comedy,"To the Manor Born is a terrific show filled with humor, warmth, charm, and acidic wit. Penelope Keith is excellent as is the rest of the cast.This is a nice set with enjoyable extra features. It's worth the price!"
5,luv it luv it,"If you have never seen British comdey or To the Manor Born, you will have hours of laughter and pure enjoyment. And if you did follow the series, you will want to buy this set so that you can watch and enjoy over and over your favorite characters and episodes. you will also luv As TIme Gooes By Are You Being Served, Fawlty Towers, etc. superior"
5,To the Manor Born,"This collection does not disappoint. I love Britcoms, and this series is one of my favorites."
5,To The Manor Born,A trully great Bristish sit com with a compelling story which develops a romance to an exciting conclusion.
2,Great if you love canned laughter ...,"The canned laughter is so annoying, it makes the episodes less amusing. I wish it could be turned off, like subtitles. I hadn't seen the series on TV when it was new, and bought the collection recently thinking I'd probably enjoy it because it was so well reviewed. The problem isn't so much that I didn't think it was funny, which I didn't, but worse the same predictable situations repeat, and after one disk, you've pretty much seen what there is. The character played by Penelope Keith is tiresome, in my opinion, but the shows might have seemed a lot funnier in the late 1970's or early 80's when they were made. Peter Bowles's role is more subtle, more dry, not begging for laughs. Small footnote, the actress playing his mother was the old nanny in a couple of episodes of the original Upstairs Downstairs, in which she looked and acted like a nanny from the time of Queen Victoria."
1,silver anniversary to the manor born,"I have the complete set of ""to the manor born"" and love it, the personalities of Audrey and Richard are so strong yet they fall for each other - ending was great.I was very disappointed in the silver edition - Audrey seems to have lost her strong personality and let Richard take over for the past 25 yrs (implied in show)I was expecting a much better show, one that really tied into the series - this did not do that. It is all based one event - was hoping it would be more like the original seriesI did not find it worth the moneymvb"
1,3 months was all it lasted,"This only lasted a few months, and its just a v-6 s10. Heat shield was put back on, no oil leaks, the rubber just ripped right off the base. It's $130 from a dealer or $14 times several per year."
5,I love this stuff,"I've never been a fan of iced tea, but this stuff is great cold. It has enough fruit taste to mute the bitter note in green tea, without being overpowering or sugary. I higly recommend it. If you want something sweeter, I'd recommend Diet Lipton Green Tea with Citrus. It can be a bit harder to find, though."
5,Love this book!!!! Could not quit laughing!,This is the funniest book I have read in years! My side hurt because I was laughing so hard.It's been a rough year for me and I really needed a book like this! Thanks Ed Broth and Jerry Seinfeld!Please keep writing books like this.
2,Not up to Par,"Having read the Letters from a Nut series, I was excited to see this title. After reading though, the main problem is the length of the stories. The letters were just the right length to get in some absurdiy, then let the targets reply. In this book, the Stories drag on forever, with people regurgitating things, men trying to kiss the male narrator, his girlfriend and chihuahua sharing a name, leading to reader boredom. Halfway through, I started thumbing for the replies."
1,Convienent but not that bright.,"I placed this light in the ground in my front yard to light up my flag, that is about 7-8 feet off the ground, and it doesn't do a very good job. I will have to replace it with something brighter.**Update** I will have to replace this light all together, after just about a month it has stopped working. $19.74 down the drain."
4,pretty good solar spot,The light is not quite as strong as I would like but the panel recharges it on a fairly low direct light level and the light lasts all night. We have it to illuminate a flag.
3,Spotlights fairly bright,We used these spotlights on our front entry door to highlight Christmas decorations...Not as bright as I would have liked but adequate and no high electric bills for December due to outdoor lighting.....
1,JUNK,"THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED OVER THE INTERNET. HAS NO MORE POWER THAN A FIREFLY., AND DID NOT EVEN HAVE ALL THE PARTS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT."
1,LOW SPOT LIGHT,I bought this to shine on my American Flag outside and this thing does not shine a light bright enough to light anything up. Was very dissapointed in this item.
3,not horrible but not great either,"The light emitted is VERY low from this. I understand that solar lights are not as luminous and have other solar lighting but even considering that, these emit a very low level of light. Based on prior reviews that were positive I bought to illuminate a flag at night but even two of them aren't strong enough to do that and they sit in direct sunlight all day. I'm looking at other options at this point so these were a waste of money for me personally."
4,solar spotlight,"The solar spotlight was a snap to assemble and deploy. It works very well, but requires a full day of direct sun in order to make a bright beam after dark.I recommend it to light up after-dark ""critters""."
5,Very happy with this spot,I'm very happy with this spot light. I bought 5. Two are on each of my large palms and one is on my nativity set. My front yard is partially shaded but the lights work well in the evenings.The beams are strong enough that I only need two for each tree. I'm very happy with the product and they work well with my icicle lights that I have up for the holiday season.The lights are very easy to install into the ground. Just attached the steak and pushed them in.After one day in the sun they were read to go.They also worked well after a day of heavy rain and a frosty night.
2,Expensive and not as good as other brands,"Not exactly as advertised, certainly not weather resistant! One I ordered conked out after a mere 2-3 weeks. The other I ordered is a weak beam and only on for maybe 6 hours fully charged.I got the much less expensive & excellent One Stop Garden 2 pack at Harbor Freight for $14.99 (as of this review); they shine a full 8 hours if not more. They may have them here on Amazon as well.Amazon was good enough to refund my one Gamasonic Spot; Amazon is good people! : )"
2,Don't waste your money,This light produces such little light that it's not even worth it. Just get yourself a nice flood light and hook it up to an outdoor plug. That's what I did and I'm much happier. I just threw this thing away.....
2,Solar power?,"Yes, solar power with almost same as glowfly light.Worthless. It would be better to turn on $5 flashlight in the ground.With this quality, Too pricy!"
1,This light did not work!,I live in Miami Florida the sunshine capital but NO matter where I placed this light to be charged it did not work! Please tell me how to return it!
2,"Gamasonic GS-29W Solar- Powered LED Spotlight, White Bulb","It does not stay lite more than 2 hours and the light is very low, even when I place it facing the Sun and move it around to continue receiving the Sun Rays.I had to purchase an electric one.I would like to return it for a refund.Can you please send me a Return Authorization Form? Thank youBest regardsAmado Palavicini"
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this because it was recommended to purchase with a Nativity Scene I ordered. I have the light less than 3 feet away from the scene and it does not even light up baby Jesus. There are two leds inside and they are spaced in such a way that they do not shine in the same spot - there is a 8-12 inch gap on the scene between the reflection of the leds. There instructions are very poor (no guide as to how long they charge takes). Note: this light is in full sun during the day so there should not be an excuse for giving out poor light reflection. It is going back!
2,solar lights,bought 2 gamasonic gs-29w solar powered spotlights which i received. 1 has a light you can barely see and goes out after 3-4 hours and the otherone never worked at all. worst item i have ever bought.
2,A little better than nothing,"I have had this light for over two months and tried it in a couple of locations. The amount of light it puts out is a joke. I tried illuminating my flag (about a 7 ft. ""throw"") and it barely lighted the flag. I put it in front of a garden statue and I think a good flashlight would do better. Now I have it shinning on a plant just because I might as well use it on something. Low voltage Malibu type spot lights are MUCH better for my money. The only good thing I can say is it is very economical to operate and it does work every day the sun shines. I will not be buying another one, for sure."
4,Good Product,"I am using the solar spot light in a small 4x4 chicken coop. I just cut a hole near the place the roost and put light in solar screen out and sealed the hole. I put the switch to auto and every night my chichens have a small source of heat. This light works fine and will save me in electric to warm my chickens in the northeast winters. I left off one star because once in a while the light won't come on because of a few days of overcast, but it is a solar light."
2,Average Solar Light,"Got this to light up my flag at night. Most of the time it doesn't work, the light just is not bright enough. I have it in the ground and the flag is on a pole, about 15 feet tall. First of all it has to be a perfect sunny day to get the best brightest light, but even at that I only get a little light on the flag itself. If it is a cloudy day you don't get much light at all it just doesn't build up much of a charge. If you had several of these to light, say maybe a walkway, a sidewalk, etc. something close, it would probably work pretty good."
1,Not what I was expecting,"The brightness of this spotlight was not strong at all, in fact, we could barely see the light was on."
1,Don't recomend....,I received this last week and it just stopped working. I loved how it worked for a few days but stopped working. I changed batteries but did not help seems like there could be a short. I do not recommend this ay all. Its sad to because I really liked the look of it. And I can't figure out how to get a hold of the seller.
1,Are you kidding???,"I purchased this item on June 21. It was great for, um, a month and 10 days. Now it is no longer working. That is crazy."
1,Poor quality,"This light is a waste of money, it does not hold the charge nor is it bright enough to eluminate anything. I would not purchase this product again and will return it."
2,Didn't have much sun to charge it up,"Do not suggest this in cold, lack of sun climates, never saw it fully charged may not be fault of light just No sun!!"
1,Does not Charge,"It worked when it first arrived, but the solar charger never worked. After the first night there was no light."
3,"It's good, but only for a while","I live in a sunny area, so this takes a lot of sun energy during the day. Then night comes and it turns on great, but after a little while it just dims out until it's totally off. It's really cool, I just wished it would last longer."
5,"great item, love it",I got this to fill out an order for something else so I could qualify for free shipping. It is a GEM of a light and I've had it over a year in my backyard by my koi pond. I just searched Amazon orders so I could purchase more of these. I didn't know how much I would enjoy it and now I've decided I'd like even more light in my yard around the pool.
1,"Low light, low quality, low rating.",To say that these things are made cheaply is an understatement. The light is dim and useless. 2 of 5 broke immediately out of the box. One as I was staking it in soft dirt. 2 more went as I was trying to attach the enormous solar cell saucer section. A week later a fourth broke when my 30 lb dog bumped into it. The fifth went when the dog simply picked it up. Bad. Bad bad bad bad. Save your money and run a hard wire system.
4,Works but need plenty of sun,These lights are very bright and are doing what we wanted them to do. They do need plenty of sun light to charge up the batteries. We have them on the east side of our home to shine on the front porch. (2 each) The sun charges them and they work about 4 to 5 hours. It may stay on longer in the summer time. This would depend on the quality of the batteries and the design.//... Joe
3,That's it?,This series had so much potential. The story was so interesting and the character development seemed to be fairly deep. But towards the end it became so disjointed and everything came together so haphazardly. I was so disappointed.
5,Excellent Resource,"I was looking for a resource that would help me connect the dots between Jesus'Jewish heritage and the true church God has called today and this book has exceeded my expectations. I teach Bible Study and my students can't get enough of the valuable nuggets that tell ""the rest of the story."" Obviously this book will irritate non-believers because it gives more proof than ever that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God."
4,Indespensible,"This is the only Jewish/Hebraic/Messianic commentary I've seen. It puts scripture into perspective concerning the life and times of Yeshua (""Jesus'"" give name), without which we see through a glass darkly as to what the writers were trying to convey."
5,The Jewish New Testament Commentary,I love this commentary since it gives some of the Jewish background that helps me understand the New Testament better. Mr. Stern did a really good job explaining some things that I hadn't previously understood about the Jewish customs. I wish he had added even more comments.
3,A tease,"I expected more depth. It does give you a Hebraic look into to the New Testament but I was expecting much more from this author. Just using the Hebrew spelling for the author's names and giving brief explanations wasn't enough. The book is a good reference to view the New Testament from the Hebrew origin but not enough 'meat'. I would recommend this for your library to pique your interest but you will need more books e.g. 'They loved the Torah', 'Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus' and 'Yeshua, A guide to the original church' to learn in more depth."
3,... but see ...,"This 1992 retranslation Commentary begins the process of building a bridge from the Jewish world in which Jesus lived to our world. Yet, this comes from a modern Christian perspective. On the other hand Oxford has just publishedThe Jewish Annotated New Testament. Using the NRSV translation, its 700 pages have a more scholarly approach to develop the Jewish world around Jesus, Paul, Peter and James, Mary and Mary Magdalene, who were part of that Jewish community. Annotations and 30 notes describe the Jewish oral law, angels, Jesus in Jewish thought, the Dead Sea Scrolls, etc. But that's the Oxford book, not this Companion."
5,so helpful!,"This commentary on the new testament is so helpful for the Jewish/Messianic/or Christian Believer. It provides a glimpse to the authentic culture of the 1st Century, which really makes the gospels and the rest of the books seems like reading them for the 1st time.It's too bad there's not one volume with both the New Testament text and the Commentary, but I understand that would be a huge book."
3,Jewish New Testament Commentary,"This bible commentary is definitely from a Jewish mind set, and when you read it you can more understand the writtings of Paul. Paul was constantly referring to the Jews blindness and hardness of heart when it came to the ways of the new covenant, and David Stern shows a lot of that."
1,"Fraud, Hoax, Joke","This one of the most commercial books I have ever read. Imagine Jesus and his disciples speaking ""yiddish"". Well this is what David Stern has them doing. Even the comments on the dust jacket by the publishers say:""Freshly rendered from the original Greek into ENJOYABLE English"" - true enjoyable and easy to read, but not very precise. ""By a Messianic Jew"" - an oxymoron if ever there was one. The book is written as a very loose translation of the Greek and is interspersed with Hebrew words to give a ""scholarly"" flavour to the text. He does NOT succeed. The opinions expressed here are my own personal opinions and are not meant as an insult or slander to the translator."
1,More Christian Deception...,"To all ... who are Jewish, or interested in Judaism. This book of commentary is not a Jewish commentary, in fact it is just a thinly veiled attempt to bring unaffiliated/uneducated Jewish people into the folds of Christianity. For those looking for books on Jewish responses to Christianity, you will do yourself no justice in purchasing this book."
4,Good Book - But I thought ending could be better,I would give this 3 1/2 - 4 stars. It was a good book. I just go irritated with Aline. What made this book a winner was the secondary storyline of Livia and Shaw. I started flipping past Aline and McKenna's story to get to Livia and Shaw's. I wish that they had a whole book. I also thought it would have been great if Lisa put Aline and Livia's brother together with Alex (I think that was his name) - he was the homosexual lord. I was kind of dissapointed with the ending. She really didn't go into any detail - yeah we figure Aline and McKenna marry and go to New York - and we know that Shaw comes back for Livia. I just wish she gave us more at the end. It was almost like she was bored with her own book and rushed the ending. I'm not saying this isn't a good book - I just have higher expectations for Lisa's books.
3,"Read it - because it's good, just not her best","Love Lisa K's books because I always seem to be totally involved and can lose myself for hours in her characters and situations. However, with this book I found the secondary storyline distracting. The interactions between the two main characters were not very intense - you got the feeling they could take or leave each other sometimes. The ending seemed rushed and pat. Overall, I found it would have been OK for another author - just not what I would expect from this author"
5,WOW! This is real art in romance,"Iloved this book! Ms. Kleypas wrote it like Judith Mcnaughty (my favorite romance author)will, the book was as much gut wrenching, moving and also on the romantic side it was very steamy, hot and sexy. I loved both characters, but something annoying in my opinion was the side story of Gideon and the other girl. Too long, it should be put in another book exclusively for them. I skipped many parts of their story just to read the main romance."
4,Could NOT put it down !!!,"Another excellently written tale by Lisa Kleypaas...(but aren't they all !! ).. The story of McKenna and Aline flows so well , that one cannot help but feel part of it.. Compassion, sadness, happiness, and joy ...they are all there and inside of us.. Do not miss reading this one !!"
2,My least favorite Lisa Kleypas book ever,"This seemed like a half-hearted story by this author. The beginning is fun and interesting, but it quickly dissolves into a less-than-romantic plot between the main characters. Twelve years is too long, Aline's injury is too much, and McKenna's bitterness is too overwhelming to the story. I found the story line between Aline's sister and McKenna's business partner to be much more interesting. I'd recommend skipping this one."
5,"Beautiful, Inspiring and ""a Keeper""","Since so many people have already summarized the plot--and by the way, a few of these reviews have spoilers in them, which is too bad--let me just say that I was completely swept away. The part between the young lovers in the first few chapters of the book was so believable and sweet. This is the first book I have ever read by Ms. Kleypas, and I was really impressed with the maturity of the characters and the depth of their emotions. Now I'm going to read everything of hers I can get my hands on! Again The Magic is on my keeper shelf for good."
2,For anyone else great,"I must agree with the reviewer who say this is not up to Lisa Kleypas's standards. While McKenna was a great guy, he's the first of Kleypas's heroes that I haven't fallen in love with. Lady Aline was likeable, but her secrecy seemed forced - a plot contrivance that was not only not true to her character, but not at all true to the relationship she and McKenna had once had. In addition, the sex scenes were so, um,...icky. This is how a virgin is deflowered by the man she has loved all her life? Yes, he didn't know - but she did, and we did. Yuk. And the second one was no better. The secondary characters and romance were much better - Kleypas actually seemed to like and understand them more than McKenna and Aline. I am a long-time Kleypas fan, and will definitely buy her next book, but this one should be purchased used or borrowed."
2,Muddled through it,"I am surprised by all of the excellent ratings on this book. While I did enjoy small sections of this book, I pretty much just tolerated it. I did't care for the whole burnt leg bit or the secondary story line taking up so much time in the book.I LOVED Then Came You and Dreaming of You. The Hathaway series was also amazing.Reading the Travis Series now and they are HOT!!"
2,Again the Magic,"I have always counted on Lisa Kleypas for an exceptional read. Not so with this long, drawn-out downer. The plot (pretending not to love a man, sending him away for his own good at great sacrifice to yourself, causing him to hate you, go make his forture and come back for revenge) has been done many, many times. Even in Victorian England, is this ever really the only way? And is a young man who is aware that a young woman has loved him all her life, really supposed to fall for this when it comes out of the blue? Finally, the heroine's disfiguring leg burns being the ""conflict"" that nearly keeps these soulmates apart forever, is an insult to the heartbroken hero and the suffering reader.I would not buy this book. I suggest checking it out of the library at the threat of the next big snowstorm."
4,A Reader,"I also feel that while all of Lisa Kleypas's books are enjoyable, so far none have compared to ""Dreaming of You"" and the hero and heroine in that story, Derek and Sara (although ""Suddenly You"" came close). The plot line of McKenna just believing that all of the sudden Aline becomes concerned with titles and birth status and sends him away make it hard to feel for him the rest of the story."
3,Fair,"Not one of the best books by this author,but enjoyable enough to ensure that it was read from cover to cover."
5,Yes!,"In my opinion, this is one of Kleypas's best books. It made me laugh, cry, and get so involved in character emotions I had to put it down for a moment. Amazing story! And the erotic bits are superb. Definitely worth every penny! If you are looking for a good erotic novel, or good erotic novelist, Lisa Kleypas is the best choice."
3,"A good read, but not one of her best","I absolutely adore Lisa Kleypas and rushed out to buy this book the moment it was released. While an interesting and entertaining read, I would not place it as one of Kleypas's best efforts. (Which still makes it better than many other authors.) The plot is engaging enough (estate working boy loves rich employer's daughter, which, as we all know, brings drama), but I often feel there wasn't enough reason NOT to be together. Several times during the novel I just wanted to say, ""Get OVER it"" and put the book down. On the flip side, it was nice to have the subplot of Aline's sister and McKenna's partner; it livened up the book a bit."
3,"Alright, but not her best!","Ok, I love Lisa Kleypas, there are very few of her books that I don't just instantly fall in love with, but this was one of them. I don't really know exactly what it is about this book that I didn't care for, but something just wasn't right. I think it had something to do with the interactions between Aline and McKenna. She loved him so much, and he loved her, but they couldn't seem to work past their issues till the end. Oh, and I HATED her parents! They were HORRIBLE! Anyway, this was not a terrible book, but it just wasn't good enough to make my keeper shelf."
5,Again the Magic is my favorite of the Kleypas books,"This is the only one that's made me cry. Excellent book! BTW, reviewer is not Jonathan, but his wife."
5,Oh I would read this book again!!!!,"I loved this book. In a world where historical romance novels can seem almost like copies of the same book, this book was a breath of fresh air. I loved the characters, the duel love stories, and the pace of the book. I will be reading more of this author!"
3,Not exactly there,"The first book that I read from this author was memorable, but this one unfortunately was not. The story began with promise...but did not deliver. I found myself skimming the pages, just to end the story since I bought the book. If I hadn't bought it, I would not have finished the story. I was really excited for the hero and heroine to meet again, but once they did, I didn't feel any real sparks or tension or any real emotion. It was so.....blah. I liked the story with her sister and Shaw better as well. Although Mckenna could have been an extraordinary hero, he just failed in the end....sigh...."
3,"Good, but not a favorite.","There was a lot to this story that I liked, but I did get frustrated with Aline when she wouldn't be honest about her injury with the man she loved. I didn't understand the point of keeping the secret, she had absolutely nothing to lose at that point and everything to gain.Even though not a favorite story, I can't help liking all of LK's books. I feel so happy after reading them. They put me in a wonderfully positive mood, and I consider that a blessing."
4,"Not My Favorite Kleypas, But Still Enjoyable","I got really excited when I read the back of this book and saw the name ""Marsden,"" since I'd just finished reading the Wallflowers Series and realized Lady Aline Marsden is the sister of the hero of one of those books. I did enjoy the story of Lady Aline's forbidden love for a former servant, but I think the whole ""we can't be together because of a terrible secret that's really not that big-a-deal"" story line was dragged out. I got more into the story within a story of Lady Aline's younger sister, Livia, and Gideon Shaw. I would have much rather read an entire book about the two of them and the serious issue they faced. However, it was a good read and I'll definitely keep reading Lisa Kleypas!"
3,2 love stories for the price of one,"This is my first read by this author and I probably read it out of order, but I'll offer a quick review. This is a quick and enjoyable read of a not terribly complex story. The title is appropriate and the characters are likable. Although most of the book is about Aline and McKenna, there is also a good story about her sister Livia and Gideon.There are a few downsides to this story. I found the ""misunderstanding"" between Aline and McKenna pretty weak and not quite believable that it could simmer for 12 years. I also questioned Aline and Livia's independent attitudes and 20th century morals which don't quite fit with the early 19th century time period."
5,Two stories for the price of one,"I enjoyed both the main storyline between Aline and John and the secondary one between Olivia and John. I think that Olivia and John were worthy of their own book. I really felt that their story tugged at my heartstrings a little more than Aline and John's but both couples got to me and their stories were both very good. A little something for someone who hasn't read this one yet or just did, Aline and Olivia's older brother, Marcus, just got his own book. ""It Happened One Autumn"" was just released in Oct.2005 and i just read it. It was really, really good as well. Anyways take the time to enjoy this one and really all of Lisa Kleypas' novels. I wasn't disappointed. I sort of sound like I work in her sales and marketing department or something, but i swear i don't. I'm just a fan."
4,I enjoyed it,"Lisa Kleypas is again in fine form with her latest novel ""Again the Magic."" I love her books and this was enjoyable, but not as good as ""Dreaming of You"" which was her best. I look forward to reading the sequel of ""Again the Magic"" which will probably focus on the secondary characters Livia and Gordon. They are in my opinion more interesting and real than the main characters in this book. I had a problem with Aline and McKenna because despite their great love for each other, they couldn't be honest with one another until the very end. Considering their past together and their bond, you would think they could be truthful because of their friendship. But all in all I'm glad I bought this book because nobody writes historical romance like Lisa Kleypas. I'll definitely read the sequel."
1,Worst Kleypas ever,"I couldn't even make myself read the whole thing. The story is ridiculous. I usually love Lisa Kleypas, it did not seem like her usual style. Don't waste your time or money. Frankly, I am surprised to see so many good reviews, it is baffling."
1,"it's a very disappointing book, DON'T READ IT!!!!","MEN!,but I like mrs. Lisa's books a lot, but actually this book is her worst, most pathethic book I ever read of her, and I've read all of them. the charecters almost don't appear in it, the story could be of the sister's charecter because she appears more in the story than even the handsome ""hero,"" I'm relly disappointed of this book. this story is really off the hook it's almost as if she hadn't been the one writing it. it sucks guys don't waste your money on IT! I bought it and I wished I hadn't LISA KLEYPAS THIS IS NOT YOUR STYLE"
3,Miscommunication rules this novel,"I love the idea of an upper class lady falling in love with a lower class man, but this one just didn't do it for me. The hero works at the heroine's estate as a young man. They are caught kissing, and he is kicked off the property and makes a fortune in America. After he leaves, the heroine has an accident that leaves her legs badly burned. What follows is a second chance at love story that gets annoying. The heroine could explain everything SOOO many times, but her pride gets in the way. Instead, she draws the heartache on and on by not telling the hero what really happened to her. I know that miscommunication is often used in romances, but I do not like it when that is all there is to a story. The ending allowed for a three star instead of two star rating. The side story of her half sister also helped move along the story. All in all, this was my least favorite Kleypas story. I love all of her novels, except this one."
2,Again no magic!!,"I am sorry, but I have to join those who did not rate 'Again the Magic' by Lisa Kleypas too highly. I never thought I could give any book written by Lisa 2 stars, but there you have it...I kept waiting for the book to come alive, make me laugh, make me gasp, but it did absolutely nothing for me! It was boring, and for a 391-page book, there was (IMO) absolutely zero conversation between the hero and the heroine. They had no spark, they were not happy....what a couple! Now there was a secondary romance story between Livia and Shaw- not that their story was great too, in fact for the first time ever, I didn't enjoy having extras in a book! However I liked Shaw much more than McKenna. I'm sure this was a one-off and hope the next Lisa Kleypas book I read turns out to be much better than this. Still love her books. Go Ms. Kleypas!!"
5,Lovely in every way,"I have read romance novels for the past thirty years, and this is one of the best. I started it and could not stop--told my husband to fix his own dinner because I wasn't about to put this book down. I am going to tell my friends to read it, and they should buy their own copies because it is too precious to loan out."
2,Disappointing!,"Dear readers, this book was very disappointing! Lisa Kleypas could have done much better. She should have given Livia and Shaw their own book. They totally overshadowed Aline and Mckenna's story."
2,"Depressing, Dark and Heavy","I am a huge Lisa Kleypas fan, but this book was not for me. The love scenes actually made me cringe. I didn't think it was romantic at all and I was just ready for the whole story to be over. McKenna's desire for revenge was so powerful that I didn't even like him...and I thought the heroine was a ninny. Life's too short to read something this depressing."
2,Love soap operas? This is the book for you!,"Lisa Kleypas trots out all of of the old tried and tired formulas: 1.Young forbidden lovers permanently separated by a cold overbearing father. 2. Hero sent to a brutal taskmaster, he escapes, makes his fortune, swears vengeance. 3. Heroine disfigured in freak accident however scars are hidden but emotional scars are not, heroine remains a virgin. 4. Hero returns rich and successful to exact vengeance. 5. Hero and heroine rekindle their love. All is well. Happy ending.Slap on a more modern slant and you have the plot to a Melrose Place episode. Can you say melodrama? And the secondary plot was more of the same histrionics. Not a real likable character in the bunch. I couldn't finish this book. Don't waste your money. If interested in Lisa Kleypas buy some of her earlier titles."
2,Didn't care for the whole plot!,I get so tired of the heroine and her larger than life pride and this was another example of it. Perhaps they should have another catergory for romance novels separating them down to what they deal with. This one would be stubborn pride!!!Didn't feel like there was much chemistry there either. Don't get me wrong Lisa is a GREAT writer but this book just didn't hit the mark for me. Maybe because I wasn't in the mood for this whole I'm so prideful and can't fess up type of thing.
4,Enjoyable Read,Just a wonderful storyline with strong 1st & 2nd characters. I loved them all. This is definately up on my list of best books I've read from start to finish.
1,No spill cup,"I bought this hoping it would be helpful for our lab since we were moving from Texas, USA to Germany and those little bowls that come with the giant kennel really aren't very useful for our dog. Before we even got him checked in at the airport in Austin the tabs had already broken off one side of the bowl. The airline agents helped us out by drilling a hole into it and rigging it with a zip tie but they shouldn't have had to do that. I was very disappointed with this buy!"
5,Great little cup!,"This is a great little cup! It fits snuggle and provides water when we're away. There is a lip around the edge that sometimes the Greyhound can get off but he usually leaves it alone."". I don't remove it to fill it since I want the clips to remain snug. Instead I add water with a plastic squirt bottle. That eliminates spilling when trying to reattach a full cup and keeps the remove and reattach times to a minimum."
3,Too Small to use for a large breed dog,"Had this cup been larger, it would have received a better rating. This served its purpose for the most part, but required refilling too often to be completely effective."
1,crap,"These looked great when I ordered them, how perfect I thought!I bought 5, 2 for my parrot, 3 for my dog crates for water.The rounded lip almost falls off when you touch it, takes a dog about 10 seconds to pull offthe ""spill proof"" ring.the holders that attach the the cage, well 1 of the 3 didn't make it off even one and it bent and broke.It's way to soft a material. You have to be really carefull removing it. Not for everyday use!And spill proof? Only while you carry it. As the dog drinks kinda sidewise due to the shape, he drips as much in the crate as he drinks...."
5,Perfect!,"These cups are absolutely fantastic! They fit all our dog kennels/crates and even with the most rambunctious dogs, they are always intact with the kennel when we return. No more spilled water and no more messes. These are hard to find anymore so I'm always searching to find more."
3,Thin,I like this size and was replacing a WearEver. This one is as nice but the aluminum is a bit thinner. We'll see how well it lasts as my experience with thinner pots is that they burn and warp more easily as heat doesn't distribute as well.
3,Lightweight,"Non stick surface holds up okay, but handle sturdier than pot. The color and lid compliment this product well, best for those quick fix meals."
1,the cover is better than the book,This was a disapointment; I ordered online and didn't discover that it was a reissue until the book arrived. The plot was thin and character development thinner. Read an old Eliz. Lowell before wasting your time & money on this one
1,blech......,"she meets the guy, he's a total chauvinistic jerk, but he has his tongue down her throat within the first ten minutes, and she strangely attracted. He's the emotionally scarred type, she's as well-a widow whose known love and, of course, can reform this ""all women are scum"" guy. OHHH, heaven help me from Harlequin formulaic drivel. This author can and does do better-save your money!"
2,Re-issued,"The problem with re-issued books is that they tend be be ""dated,"" this book is no exception. Times change, writing styles and preferences... The premise of the story was good, but the story and the writing could have been better. It was okay but nothing great, and I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that this book was written over 10 years ago. The author has obviously grown a great deal as a writer in the last 10 years, fortunately for us.Another problem with re-issued books: they're released with new covers and we, the readers, are rarely told they're re-issues! I really resent that!I gave it 2 stars because I loved the cover art, even if the story and the writing were a bit too simplistic."
2,Do not rely on this as your only study guide!!!!!,I studied this book for about two months and then purchased thetranscenders for the 70-270 and failed. The book was a broad over view of the Operating system. But does not go deep enough for you to pass this exam. Allot of the things that were focused on in the book are not even on the actual exam!! If you want to pass this exam find a different study guide. I highly recommend using the transceders also!
3,Good Survey--No depth,"If you are buying this guide as your sole sorce of info for the 70-270 exam, you are in trouble. While this guide does a fair job of covering the objectives, it does not provide the in-depth information needed to pass this exam. Also, the questions included on the CD do not begin to approach the Microsoft test's in difficulty. If you couple this guide with the Resource Kit (read it cover to cover) and a LOT of hands-on with XP, you have a good chance, but this book by itself will not prepare you adequately for the exam."
2,Not worth the read,"Having read many MCSE books, this one is by far the worst. From incorrect and error prone 'Tests', to repeated and constant references to Windows 2000, when it should have read Windows XP, leaves me to believe that this book was rushed to the printers before anyone had proof read it.I would not recommend this book to anyone seriously studying for their MCSE. The errors are too many to overcome."
1,Poorly edited and very inaccurate,"This book is riddled with typos and technical errors. This is not the book you want to prepare you for the 70-270 exam. Even the CD that ships with the book is loaded with errors and programming mistakes. Should you purchase the book, Sybex will replace your CD with an updated one that includes a new version of the book in a soft-copy, but it's not worth it. Don't waste your money."
2,badly edited,"This book is FULL of errors.On one page it lists NT 3.51 as an OS that you can directly upgrade to XP with, and for the rest of the book it doesn't!One of the chapters is also entitled ""Upgrading to Windows 2000""...an obvious mistake they made when copying and pasting stuff from their other books...very sloppy work.Even the first few pages have sentences without any spaces between the words! The chapter review tests also have errors in them.If I were a novice who hadn't had any experience with the previous NT based client OS's (Win2k and NT4) then I would get very frustrated with this book...in the end there are only a couple of minor changes from Windows 2000 which will be tested on anyway."
4,Pretty good,"I've never ran a crossover on my system before, but this seems to do pretty well. I can control a bunch of different highs, lows and mids with this thing. I found that the easiest thing to do was to tune my system with the crossover first, then fine tune my stereo. Most aftermarket stereos come with a built in crossover anyway but they don't give the extra sound boost that a crossover paired with an amp does. For the price, most boss products seem do do a really good job and this is no exception."
4,I really enjoy this DVD!,"I'm pretty new to yoga. Not that flexable and not that used to exercising. And I'm overweight, which can make things get in the way during some of these poses.BUT, I go through the DVD about everyother day. And though I may not be able to do each pose exactly the way she does, I do what I can.I Know that this program is making me feel better and I can tell I'm getting better at doing the poses every day because I'm getting stronger and more flexable.I've not tried any other fertility yoga dvds, but I'm happy with the one I bought. I find her voice to be soothing, the moves to be pretty easy for me (a beginner) and its so relaxing! I nearly always follow my afternoon yoga with a nap =)"
3,hmm odd,"recived the game later then it should have been, but the real problem is that when i recived it it was out of its carton. why did i get a used one? i did not see where i was buying a used one. it is a gift so it better still work."
1,Bulb,It show that it is a clear bulb but when I got it is not clear bulb it is a white bulb. Im not happy with the product.
3,Great for history and background of the state,"I bought this book in preparation for a 10-trip to Arizona. I fell in love with the gorgeous pictures, and I had to have it. This book offers comprehensive information about Arizona's history and its myriad cultures, as well as its climate and environment. It's almost like an enjoyable textbook about Arizona, with lots of fun commentary and information about attractions and sights.However, this is NOT the guidebook that you want to use when choosing hotels and restaurants. There is simply not that much information in the book regarding either of these categories, which is puzzling, because that information is something I'm searching for when planning a trip.The guide is still worth buying, because it will help you understand the place you are about to visit, but I wouldn't rely on it to book hotels or make dinner reservations. Use Frommer's or Fodor's for that."
4,"Decent, but occasionally dodgy","Whle I enjoyed readying this book and the infodump that came with it, I can't bring myself to give it a five. There were several quotes that were elipsesed in places that made them a little less credible, and I think that's an editing error that is easliy fixed. Oherwise, the book didn't layout an effective and plasuible action plan to deal with the lack or plurality in American leadership, or to get more women into leadership possitions.That said, this book it more of a call to arms than an review of the situation, and does get the juices flowing about how one feels about the current state of women in the world, but especially in the US, which is not even the top 100 on equality for women (taken from the book) and make you upset enought to consider other options.Over all, effective and enjoyable, but not the perfect read."
2,Closing the Gap,"Same old whine -- and we must stop it. It all goes back to ONE. Being the first to step up and out. As Nike urges: JUST DO IT. If you don't like what is happening speak up. Write the letter. Make the phone call. Form groups, create a ruckus, be UPPITY. As for Hilary -- being a leader also entails being trustworthy, honest, and straight speaking....there were better example than her."
4,Quality reading,"This book says it all, although the section on feeding was somewhat vague. I really enjoyed the photographs. Although I do not have a mini donkey, I'm sure giving some though to it now. These animals are marvelous creatures. I think instead of another dog I'll go for a mini donkey and call him Kansas."
5,Awesome CD,"I found out about this bank by googling ""who is the head in Dare"" the Gorrillaz song. I'm glad I did because although most of this stuff was made when I was a kid, the music is sound. You can hear how dance music progressed from here to dance to techno to pop music! Excellent!"
2,Beautiful design but disappointing,"I have purchased many needlepoint books and used most of them with wonderful results. I found Ms. Gordon's designs some of the most innovative and colourful. Unfortunately it is impossible to use them unless one has an endless supply of wools readily available as the author neglected to give us the amounts. The charts are also very difficult to read. I think that this book could have used a more careful editing in order to make it useable. That said, I will continue to purchase Ms. Gordon's future endeavours, if only to ooh and aah at her fabulous designs."
5,the best baby music according to our baby,the song selections great. it isn't annoying or maudlin. our son loves it and it always soothes him. after 500+ listens we still like it. if you have a baby and good taste in music get it.
5,wonderful CD,Elizabeth Mitchell has such a wonderful voice. I like the songs almost and much as my daughter does. I recommend this CD.
5,Awesome for children and adults of all ages,"My 16month old can not get enough of this CD. We play it for her in the car and we love watching her bop to the beat. Cute, and soothing songs that will have you singing them to your children after the CD has stopped playing. We also have her other two cd's You are my little flower and you are my sunshine, and we think this one is her best (but we also enjoy and play her other two cd's for our little one!). Buy and enjoy."
5,Beautiful,"I never leave reviews but felt compelled to do so this time! This album is hypnotic, thoughtful and absolutely beautiful. I feel blessed to have found Elizabeth Mitchell's music."
4,Hasn't left our CD changer since we got it,"My 3-year-old and I first found Elizabeth Mitchell when I bought her fantastic CD with Lisa Loeb, ""Catch the Moon,"" so I was excited to hear she had a new release. My daughter loves it so much, this CD hasn't left the changer in my car since I got it last year. And best of all, Mommy likes to listen to it, too."
5,I adore this CD,"This is our third Elizabeth Mitchell CD, and I cannot get enough of it. All of her songs are so melodic and soothing. I appreciate the history of the music as well. Ms. Mitchell tells why she chose the songs she did on the insert included with the CD. She points to the great singers and songwriters of our past and helps us see how the music then is still relevant and enjoyable today. I highly recommend all of her CDs, you will not be disappointed."
5,Thanks for this Elizabeth Mitchell CD!!!,"You are My Little Bird: Great condition; fast shipment; nicely packaged. What more can I say. I love this CD, and I am so happy to own it! It is for my grandson."
2,Not Like Julia Child,"I find Lidia's cooking interesting and learnable, but her narrative very boring. Her monotonous voice lulls me to sleep."
5,Works!,Installed a new oil pressure switch while changing oil adapter gasket. Its been working great so far came with red thread sealant already installed on it. NO LEAKS1999 Crown Victoria
5,Reason for wierd sizes,The reason for the missing 1/3 measure is because these are made to measure out muffin batter so they are made for the size of different muffin tins. I agree that 1/3 measure would be great too because I love them just to use as measuring cups or scoops in canisters.
5,I LOVE THESE MEASURING SCOOPS!,They're perfect for scooping ingredients out of the canisters with one hand. The only drawback is that my friends keep trying to steal them.
1,No 1/3 cup measure,"This is the strangest set of measuring cups imaginable. There is no 1/3 cup measure. Just 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and 1 cup. This makes no sense to me, and is inconvenient. For the price, one would expect to get all five standard measures, or at the very least a 1/3 cup measure, even if it meant halving a 1/4 cup or doubling a 1/8 cup. Don't waste your money on something so frustrating."
2,Silent? Not even close!,"The power supply seems to work fine, but the claim (right on the box) that it has a ""silent fan"" is complete nonsense. The fan is much--and I mean much--noisier than the stock unit on my HP a6442 computer. Far too noisy to be tolerable. This thing's going back. It might work OK in a context where noise doesn't count, but if you're trying to create a quiet environment conducive to work (or contemplation), look elsewhere."
3,"Loud, loudest component item in computer.","Well, I have used this power supply for a year or more, only con is that it is loud, it makes more noise than any other component in the computer. The silent fan is a lie, there is nothing silent about this fan, might get a new power supply for this system as well, as I'm currently building a completely new system."
1,JUNK !!!!!!!,"I purchased this V500 on July 28th, 2009. By June of 2010 it had stopped working. Not even a year out of it. What a piece of junk."
4,One annoyance but otherwise awesome.,"The Power Supply works amazing and got here really quick. My only problem was that although it was listed as compatible with the old Dell PC I was installing in, it did not fit the case. I had to use steel cutters to widen the gap in the metal on the back of the case to allow the power cord to be plugged into the supply. Aside from this everything was perfect."
2,Too noisy,Somehow they installed the fan blade or the fan blade guard wrong and this thing sounded like a buzz saw until it got warmed up.After a couple years it died.
5,excellent product,Changed my life. Truth about how to take excellent care of your body. Doesn't tell you a step by step to anything but is a great info gathering book with plenty of details to help you if you are on a quest for true health and healing things the conventional western medical community have been unable to truly help with.
1,The blatant art of self-promotion,"This book is nothing more than an infomercial in print. There may be some valid points in it, but they are overshadowed by non-relevant Biblical quotes, plugs for the author's snake oil remedies and testimonials from PhD's, not M.D.'s. Things like ""I don't want to tell you what's in my secret formulas because I am afraid someone will misuse it"". Yeah, right.It really takes a lot for me to give a bad review, especially one that is supposed to be promoting alternative medicine. But I am sorely disappointed in this book."
1,cleanse & purify thy self,"A lot of words little substance, takes too long to get to the point,You'd think that since this info was around since 1900's the book today would be more informative. I guess the object here is to have the sick folk buy direct from the author. I might get volume 2 just to see if the misery pattern of writing is continued."
4,Cleanse yourself up with the cleanse!,"Dr. Anderson's approach gets down to the basics of how the human body works and makes it easy to understand why our bodies are so full of toxins and poisons. For the first time I really understand how things we consume, breathe, or absorb into our bodies affect things on a cellular level, and it's very shocking to realize all the damage we do to ourselves. Wake up and educate yourself! Although I didn't do his particular cleanse, I've done others, and it really makes a difference in how I feel, look, and live. This book is a must-have for anyone interested in making a difference in their health, or for anyone interested in holistic, natural lifestyles."
5,Brilliant!,"I am so thankful that Richard Anderson wrote this book, i assume that in 50 yrs from now people will look back and acknowledge how right he was in his health approach. Must read this book if you are serious about your health."
5,A Writer's Helper,"This book is a must for writers of nonfiction. I've recommended it to others who also found it indispensable, but I'm not letting my copy out of sight."
2,Recovery process did not work,"The laptop crashed. Thanks to the cradle that allows my another computer to read the hard disk through USB, I was able to recover all my data. BUT the recovery CDs did not work. The BIOS seems to ignore the existence of the external CDROM driver no matter how you set the BIOS parameters. It could either be a problem of the CDROM driver or a bug in the laptop's BIOS or bootup program."
3,"OK product, but won't boot from CD","I agree with the previous reviewers. This computer will not boot from an external CD, no matter what BIOS settings you choose. (I was using an external USB CD). I would have thought this is a fairly basic requirement and I'm convinced it's a BIOS bug. I havn't been able to find a patch.Sharp, if you're reading this, it's a shame that such a nice product has been let down by a simple thing. I suggest you fix it quick, before you lose sales."
1,Hard Drive Quality is a JOKE,"Like others, I purchased the MM10 as a tech toy. Little did I know what a hassle owning it would be. Didn't have it two weeks before the hard drive crashed and they sent me a new unit. This was handled very quickly and with great support. The second MM10 lasted a little over a month when it displayed ""no operating system found"". The third unit didn't last a month when the hard drive crashed. They are telling me I installed a ""hard drvie password"" through the BIOS and that I need a new hard drive and new software costing $440!!!! I never set any password and the support people are unwilling to even send the unit back without charging me $70. Still in the middle of trying to get my money back for this junk. Be warned!"
1,Like my toys,"The MM10 sure is sweet, but the support is as bad as I've seen. I'll never by a Sharp product after dealing with RUDE customer support and sales. After 3 conversations and all I spoke with were aloof and un-caring, the morale must be very low at this company."
1,Repair is a Joke! No Customer Service.,"I had my pc mm10 for over a year and did not have an extended warranty. As if on que, the HD did not work anymore and had to send it back for repair. They quoted $120 labor and $386.50 for HD and the part was out of stock. With over $500 charge, you can buy another modest notebook. I asked them to give me an estimate for replacing HD before I sent it, but they insisted to send it first for inspection. Had I known it, I would not have sent it back. Now they are holding on to my notebook. Over 3 weeks since I told them to return my notebook without their ""service,"" they did not send it back. I wonder if they wanted to sell my notebook to somebody else if I forgot about it? After talking over phone twice, I finally sent an e-mail as an evidence of my request to return it. You trust these people at your own risk! Somebody at the management of this organization seems to have a very distorted way of business."
2,"WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT I""VE EVER SEEN",I like the computer because I cant carry much wait due to a wrist nerve condition. The motherboard died and I simply can not find anywhere and I dont know who sell it. If I send it to SHARP i wont be able to afford it.Any suggestions?
2,Too noisy,I bought this item from Amazon in Jan 2012; The clipper it's too noisy. It's painful to hear when you use it on your head.The trimmer works fine and quieter.
1,Not what it seems,"From the picture it looks like I would receive a nice,soft, comfortable, pastel colored nursing gown. If that's what your expecting, save your money and keep looking. The material is not soft, it's more like a thick cotton and the color purple I ordered like the one in the picture is a much darker purple. I'm completely disappointed with this purchase."
4,delightful!,"This robe is great. The fabric is soft and drapey with just the right amount of stretch. The only issue I have is the sewn-on belt... I'd rather it be a little higher to hit me at my natural waist, but this is a small complaint about a robe I simply love otherwise."
2,Cheap looking robe,"After I received and tried the robe on, I cannot agree more with Jaimerika. There is nothing special about it. It looks like a $15-20, not a $50 dollar robe. I bought it to wear at the hospital after I deliver my baby. Now I do not even know if I would be able to wear it at home in front of my husband. I will be looking for another robe."
2,Terrible Flavor,The title of my review says it all. The Flavor is an odd chive too salty flavor with very little onion taste. Stick with Knorr Products.
2,Barely adequate,"I've given this annual two tries now, and I'm not sure it's getting another.I greatly enjoyed many of the team comments, but the player comments were greatly irritating. There's more to a player than predicting what he's going to do next, and the self-conscious adherence to some truly banal predictive measures makes even that aspect unsatisfactory reading. Brock Hanke's contributions are particularly irritating. His arrogance displays his obvious need to be considered a player in his field."
1,too difficult to read,"If you like yours stats raw, undiluted, and irrelevant, this is your book. A horrible book, very hard to read without a magnifying glass. Egotistical reviewers. Bill James/STATS books are far superior."
3,Unspectacular at best.,"I ordered this book with high hopes, and the reviews here were good. But I just got the book, which means it just came out, and the other reviews were from as much as two months ago. The book's not bad, though. But you can get a lot of the same information for free all over usenet and the World Wide Web. Jay Walker should get to write more. Not great, but OK, and I feel misled by the obviously fake reviews from two months before the book was even released."
2,Going downhill fast,"I agree with the last reviewer. This annual was promising a few years ago, but now it's barely adequate. The statheads appear to have taken over the store. Suggestion--look for writers who only have one piece in the book, Ruane, Art Martone, etc. But avoid like the plague the ones whose names are on the masthead. The one exception to this is Jay Walker. He's way too good for this crowd."
1,Did not work,"This makeup base may work for some, but it did not work for my oily skin. In fact, it made my face greasy, shiny, and even oilier than before. I was very dissatisfied with the results. I gave it away. It may work better for combination skin or skin that is a little drier, but definitely did not work on my oily skin. Will not buy again."
1,Doesn't work,It made my make up look caked on and really uneven. It did not help with oil and shine either. What a waste!
2,Typical Garbo elevating a mediocre film,"In spite of the spectacular costumes and lighting, this is one of Garbo's duds in which her shining talent rose far above her surroundings. MGM's early talkie version of the Mata Hari legend, the exotic French spy, is weighed down by a verbose, corny and at times confusing script, an inadequate co-star and that leaden atmosphere which was an MGM trademark and dates so many of their dramas.The print is unrestored but in better condition than other Garbo DVDs. There, are however, some noticeable jumps in continuity which could be scenes missing from the print. There are no extras except a trailer. Unless the DVD is purchased as part of one of the Garbo collections, it is poor value."
2,Garbo Poses,"Greta Garbo has always been interesting to watch, with her many expressions, especially sad ones, and her great looks. However the story itself is thin, more a vehicle to look at Garbo than a really interesting story."
4,Mata Hari,"Silly hokum of course, but I'm just such a sucker for MGM gloss. By '31 they worked out all those early talkie kinks, & the sets and costumes just shine. Nice mobile camera, too. Ramon Novarro is so callow as the ""Russian"" pilot that you want to cane him, but he's still cute as a button & generates heat in the love scenes. Garbo looks like she's actually having fun, especially when she toys with pre-arthritis Lionel Barrymore (he stands! he walks!). 8/10"
2,"hmmm... fun, but don't take it as history",This movie is a bit new fantasy. They go waaayy beyond reinventing a story. Still... Garbo does a nice acting job. Too bad they didn't thought it would be neccisary to dy her hair black like Mata Hari was in real life.The movie is still a good classic... but don't take it as history.Mata Hari... the Legend[...]
5,Historical Romance at it's best,If you like to read stories that are set during the Medieval-Scottish era you are in for a treat. This romance is about a head strong warrior princess and a compassionate male mercenary. Princess Bera has twelve brothers who have trained her to stand on her own so she will never have to suffer what thier mother did. If you enjoy to read history and passion weaved into a well written tale with great characters you MUST read this!
3,"Not her best , but still enjoyable","Susan Henshaw and her family take a trip to Yosemite National Park for cross-country skiing. They meet another couple with children the same ages as Chrissy and Chad. The other couple is meeting the rest of their family for a reunion. The patriarch of the family is murdered and Susan and Kathleen have to find out why.This was an okay mystery, but not up to Wolzien's usual standards. I figured out the mystery early on, but the descriptions of the park are worth reading the book to the end."
2,Great product but...,Great product with an amazing price and free shipping but the product came with missing hardware. Luckily I Had some extra parts laying but for someone else this would a serious problem.
2,"Software Metrics: A Rigorous and Practical Approach, Revised","The structure of the book makes it difficult to read. It jumps from one type of metrics to another and then back again. The motivation for some of the metrics is not explained at all.Considering the price you should get value on all pages. This book could have been one quarter of its size and you would not have lost anything.This is far from a Practical Approach. At some places the authors seems more interested in taking down other researchers ideas than giving an objective view on, ""what metrics is, how it can be used, when it is used, what you measure on""."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought this microscope for my 8-year-old daughter. Unfortunately, the lenses are such poor quality that it's hard to differentiate your sample from the goobers in the glass. The eyepiece, for example, has an imperfection that bisects the view. You can barely make out protozoa, but only when they swim in the right place. This scope was a big disappointment. I did not expect to teach my kid microbiology, but I did hope to show her some of the microscopic world."
1,Big Disappointment!!,"I never leave negative reviews, but I have to agree with the others... this is just a rip off. I bought this micropscope because it was by National Geographic - such a reputable name when it comes to scientific education. I am a homeschooler with some very curious students, so I was so excited for them to see what everyday stuff looked like under a microscopic lense. Boy, were we ever disappointed. You can see NOTHING! At first I thought I just wasn't using it right, but then my husband confirmed it was just a piece of junk microscope. My son, age 6, has an amazing imagination and has been playing mad scientist with this, pretending to see all kinds of wonders... that is the only was its been put to use."
1,Worthless,"This Microscope set looked like it would be a great idea for our 12 yeart old son.Unfortunately this thing is junk...... You can't focus properly with this thing. I spent hours trying to get thsi thing to operate. Then dust, lint etc.... gets in the lens area and it is impossible to clean.Please do not waste your money on this. It looks neat and you get a lot of extra pieces with this kit. However soince it doesn't work they are all useless.... :("
5,Into the Great Beyond,"Rocky Votolato writes like he's just come back from a near death experience. Many of these songs are filled with a quiet desperation over some introspective awakening about his mortality; and nonetheless they're comforting. His voice is somewhere between Slaid Cleaves and Paul Simon on the emotional richter scale and it calms and soothes and sedates.Mostly acoustic, with wonderful harmonies and a perfect pace; Makers is good music to chill out to and reflect on the past, present and the unknowable future. As Rocky puts it, ""heaven or heavenless we're all headed for the same sweet darkness"". If we all embraced that notion, we'd have little reason to disagree.Highly recommended!"
5,Like looking through an old photo album,"This album has to be one of the best albums ever written. From the opening song ""White Daisy Passing"" you are drawn in by the stories of Rocky's youth. The longing for a past love, a past time in life, when things were good and simple. The album tells like a bittersweet love story that begins with a love and looking at the memories of it and it's passing by and ends with the death of a close friend. This album reminds me so much of college life and the newness of it at first, the passing days, and then one day it is all just a box full of memories that rush over you like a warm blanket and all you feel is gratefulness for experiencing them and yet you still have a small longing for the days passed.Buy this album, it will become one of your favorites. I listen to it often when I am typing up reports and notes. Great CD."
3,"Fun program, but needs updating for OS X","This program is lots of fun for a baby. It runs a little slowly on our 700 MHz G4 eMac, but our baby loves it. The only critique, though, is that it won't run on a limited account in OS X. The companion game, 123 & ABCs will let me set up the baby's account to allow me to add it to her account's limits list, but the Animal Friends does not. As a result, either I cannot run it on her account, or I have to allow administrator privileges to her account. I cannot do that since her sister also uses the computer."
1,WEAK,High price for a weak program. How hard would it be to show a different picture for each letter.I read the reviews on this Item and they were all good but this program sucks. The screen savordoesn't even work with windows 7. I feel like I got beat what a waste of time and money. After two minutes my son was all set.This program is like putting a child in a round room and telling him to get in the corner. Don't waste your money. Buy your kid a roll of toilet paper he will have more fun with it.
5,Great,I bought this for my daughter as a gift. She really loves the old school games and she was so excited to get this one.
4,"Surprisingly appealing style change, difficult as ever","Mega Man Powered Upi wasn't sure I'd like the revamped look, but it was actually appropriate. Mega Man Powered up is about as frustrasting as it's always been, which is good. What really sells the game though are the unlockables which you can then use to build your own levels to share with other owners of the game online, right from the PSP."
5,"Great Classic, Remixed!","This is an awesome game, for fans and newcomer's alike. Has strong replay value, and continues to draw you into the game. It's very simple to pick up and play. You have a choice in the beginning to either play the original NES version, or the newer ""Powered Up"" version. Which is very bubbly and cutesy, but definitly fun.If you're looking for a quick, fun platform/adventure game for the PSP, this game definitly has the full package."
3,Basic debugging guidelines list expanded to book format,"Perhaps because I am an experienced debugger I found this book to be much thicker than was justified by the content. Essentially the author lists what he considers essential rules for good debugging (no argument with the list, although other lists also work as well) and devotes a chapter to giving examples of each rule in use. The writing style is fine, with some humor that mostly seems to work--it's an easy, quick read. My complaint is simply that the discussion of each rule provided far too many words and too little new knowledge for my taste. That said, the author's guideline list is useful for those few of us that can learn such a skill as debugging from a book. In my opinion, experience helps a good deal more than reading. Nevertheless, for someone just becoming acquainted with the kind of problem solving discussed in the book the book may be useful...if referred to frequently enough for the rules to become habitual."
5,Great common-sense ideas,"The book was recommended at a training conference I attended. If you have been doing design, troubleshooting, or user support, you have probably run into the types of situations described in the book. This book is more valuable in the way it summarizes concepts in debugging, rather than giving specific techniques. The 9 ""rules"" are mostly common sense, but most of the time you run into problems precisely because you stop thinking clearly due to stress or time constraints. Go through the book, put the rules up on your wall, and you will find you start fixing things faster!"
3,Not what I expected,"As of 2012, this book should rather be called ""fixing things"" than ""debugging"".When programmers like me (doing Java, C# etc.) hear debugging TODAY (as of 2012) we expect special advices on breakpoints, watchpoints, testing, profiling and stuff like that. That's not what you find in this book.Examples were ... strange at least. Author mentioned usually hardware bugs (like some voltage was bad) or stuff like fixing vaacum cleaner or heating in house. Examples were supposed to illustrate basic concepts like ""stop thinking and look"", but I don't feel they made me any better programmer. It kind of helps giving some order to the things you do anyway and call them with right names, but that's quite it.On the other hand, Kindle versions was perfectly formatted, it was very easy to read and understand and overally it was quite fun. I would not recommend it to other programmers to get better in debugging, but I ceratainly won't discourage them from reading it (cant do any harm)."
2,These have gone downhill,"These used to be pretty good. Some stores used to keep them in a refrigerated case - I suppose to keep them fresh. I had the impression they were shipped here (Florida) from some place up north like New York City. Now they are apparently made by a franchise bakery somewhere nearby.Now they are kept on the bread shelves near hamburger buns where we shop. I don't know if they absorb flavors from the other buns. Probably not, but they taste somewhere half way between a hamburger bun and what an English muffin used to taste like.I wish I could find some good tasting English muffins, but these aren't them."
1,Outrageous Price,"This is an outrageous price on the english muffins, $6.95 and then $6.95 for the shipping.I saw the Today show's segment on this today also, I too had to check it out. But it's not Amazon.com that is selling them for this outrageous price it's the other sellers. Shopping Shark is one of them. ""Shark"" is right. Outrageous price. Check out the 2 pack price sold by Lil-Big Shots, $6.99 plus $44.15 shipping. These stores are off their rockers. Who ever in their right mind would purchase these??"
5,Irish Lace is a wonderful and romantic historical.,"I love Irish stories and I think that Ms McCarthy brings us the best. I read her ""Irish Linen"" and loved it. This one is even better. The history is well done, not heavily applied as in some historicals. But the book gives you the feeling of being there. It begins during the Irish famine and continues in America. I think anyone who loves historical romances would enjoy ""Irish Lace."""
5,ana,my mom is in this movie as extra and been looking for it for a long time :)I can't wait to watch it.
3,good but not my kind of book,"I think this one has some good story but i'm kind of person who cares about the love stories, passionate and intimation so i guess this book is just not mean for me. I'll watch more carefully next time"
2,Don't like,This book is so basic it doesn't even tell you what to do if your dog has a vaccine reaction. It only says what your dog should be vaccinated against. I thought it was going to have more info. I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not live close to a vet.
1,Zaperoko 3,Salsa monga! Zaperoko when founded was a hard core salsa or caribbean fusion; this album is romantic salsa (salsa monga). If you like salsa of the 70's you won't this; I would have not bought it if I would have known it.
5,Easy Fix For My Silverado,"Had several lights burned out in my existing assembly, and the price was right to simply pop the old one out and put this one in rather than ripping the old unit apart and attempting to solder new light bulbs in. Everything works great, and the whole job took about 5 minutes to install. Knobs are all tight and responsive and all lights working again!"
4,DVD,I ordered this as a Christmas gift and it arrived very quickly-I think it will be a great present!
5,A Yankee fan's delight!,If you enjoy the Yankees and or baseball altogether then you will enjoy this collection. It highlights some of the great Yankee moments from the past. The players...the coaches..the highlights and at times some lowlights but all in all a great addition to your Baseball DVD collection. It's a home run!!
3,Doesn't contain everything from the previous releases!,"First off, this is a very nicely produced and packaged set. It's great to have most of the episodes (this is NOT the complete series) in one set. Most of the bonus features from Hart Sharp Video's 4 sets is carried over, but as I went through the set, some segments are missing. Also, the audio commentaries (on the Berra, Torre, Posada and Rivera eps) are not included. Right now, the set is $40 as opposed to the retail price of $100. For me, $40 for the ten previously unreleased episodes made this a worthwile purchase."
5,A brief review,"One of the more complete and clear general review about probability theory (hey, it's a graduate!)"
1,Do not take Cingular,"When I signed for this plan with Cingular, I had never thought that a big and established company like Cingular would have so poor call quality. I keep getting dropped calls almost constantly and this is not a remote problem. I have friends who have cingular and everybody complains about the same. Called their customer support but they never admitted that Cingular network has this problem. Changed my phones 2-3 times hoping it to be a phone problem and not a network problem. Nothing worked. Now I am desperately waiting for my contract with these guys to get over and go to some other company."
1,worst company with good coverage,"the good thing about cingular is that there are many people on it ,and so its free with in the net work.but it sucks in customer service and from drop calls"
4,Its ATT,Not much to review here folks. I bought it and amazon was great for choosing the options. I am still with ATT unfortunately.
1,Bad all the way around,"I paid a 400 dollar cancellation fee just to be rid off AT&T/CINGULAR. I cannot even begin to tell of the horrible customer service, dropped calls, etc. I'll stick with Verizon from here on."
1,V3xx Motorola Razr,"The phone was nice but it or the service dropped called almost every time I made a phone call. Also, it would not end a call when I pressed end. You would have to shut the phone off, or it would occasionally end if you pressed end enough times. I was very unhappy with the phone."
1,cingular jail,"Worked great in Europe, but in the DC suburbs there are dead spots all over the place. Can't drive for 5 minutes (in a major metropolital area) without being cut off. The rollover program is great - I have 6500 rollowver minutes, but, alas, can hardly make a phone call..I got this phone before Martha Stewart went to jail; she went to jail after I got this contract, and now she is out.... and I still have this contract!!! Test it carefully and beware of the the 30 day return limitation."
3,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I'd read all the hype so was expecting great things. Well, if not great at least good. Sorry to say that was not the case. Far from being refreshing this exfoliant left my face red and chapped. My skin is not sensitive so that cannot account for this reaction.Lots of dollars for little result."
2,Hype,"This product IS too hyped. It's too rough on the skin. If you want something subtle, clean but efficient, try Dermalogica Daily Mircofoliant...after a couple of weeks, I went back to it."
1,Stains your fingers,"Not much product for the money. It stains you fingers and if you have dry skin it can stain the dry patched as well. There some trully great enzyme exfoliants out there, but this is not one of them."
3,A few really great songs,"While I like many of the artists on this album, not all of the songs seem real ""kid friendly"". I agree with the previous reviewer that the Maroon 5 song is just too dark. If you are looking for a great kids album that you can tolerate listing to over and over again, I recommend buying the original ""For the Kids"" instead; that CD didn't leave my car disc player for 5 months! No joke!"
2,Disappointing,"This CD is very disappointing. My husband and I have become big fans of a wide range of ""all ages"" music and were optimistic about this CD, which was put together for a good cause. We just got through listening to it with our 2-year old and were surprised at how listless all the cuts were. There is not one fun, bouncy, danceable tune in the bunch--with the exception perhaps of the Indigo Girls cut. Our son loves to dance and really enjoys engaging music. This compilation edges toward the depressive at times. Even ""Pure Imagination"" hits a few too many minor notes for such a joyful song."
2,Honestly,"I hate to say this, but my daughter and I disliked this album. We have an extensive music library including everything from the MOldy Peaches to They Might Be Giants to Ralph Covert to Dan Zanes. And as a whole we love musicthat makes you want to dance. As my two year old stated yucky. And I have to agree, we rather listen to CSN original verision of Teach Your Children or any of CSN songs, And Madonna album has better sounding songs then the Little Star honestly get the original verision of the songs. We did not get any further then song 6 which is Baby of Mine, so the album may improve after the 6 song, but I would be suprised."
2,If you are looking for upbeat music for your child...this cd is not for you!,"My 3yr son loves to sing and dance! I loved the title of this cd and most of the artists. However i was disappointed when i actually listened to it. There is really nothing upbeat about any part of this cd. In my option, i think an adult would enjoy it more than a child. Most of the songs are slow, which my 3yr old lost interest in very quickly! I was looking for classic, fun, easy to sing and dance to music and this was just not it."
3,ADult listening for little kids,"Now here's a CD I can listen to without wanting to strangle the singer of the usual sing-song lyrics. There are a few duds in the CD, but overall a great listen that won't cause parents to puke. My son loves this CD and enjoys the variety."
2,NOT FOR KIDS,"BORROWED THIS FROM THE LOCAL LIBRARY THINKING IT MIGHT BE NICE MUSIC TO SHARE WITH MY TODDLER. NOPES. IT'S VERY MUCH FOR ADULTS. AND, BESIDES GOOD OL JACK JOHNSON, A HAWAII SON, I FOUND THE MUSIC LACKING."
1,"terrible, don't waste your money","This cd is terrible. With all of the great children's albums out there, don't waste your money on this one."
1,Disappointed,"Aside from the Dixie Chicks and Jack Johnson, this album isn't so much a children's album as it is mopey alt-rock. I really feel like I wasted the $$ on this one. Do yourself a favor and look around for something else. I wasn't expecting my one year old to get it yet and I wasn't expected some maddening Wiggles ear whig that haunts your dreams. But this was mostly just blah."
3,Ok - a little self-indulgent by the artists,"I don't think they had entertaining children in mind as much as impressing themselves and other musicians. Not all bad music... ok... but it had a '90's droning feel. I rather appreciate the ""For the Kids"" series, if you're looking for good children's music by contempory artists."
2,Not for Kids,"The music on this CD is okay, but not made for children. There is nothing engaging about any of these songs. There are no smiles from my daughter when I play this CD, and that's very hard to do."
1,Terrible and Scary,"Me, my husband and my daugther all HATED this CD. The artist line-up seemed so good, but the very creepy & morose first track, ""Pure Imagination"" only led to further disappointments as the CD progressed. The only track worth listening to was the ""Rainbow Connection"" by the Dixie Chicks, but it really wasn't worth skipping through all of the other heavy and uninspired tracks. I wasted my money on this one!"
2,"Eh, so...not good","This album reek of record label packaging. There is just no heart behind it. It's great that it benefits a charity, but the album should still try and be good (besides it seems like most CD's for kids these days benefit some good cause). If you read the notes, most of the songs were pre-existing. If you're going to make a album for children, then MAKE an album for children, meaning write and/ or record new songs. Besides all this, Madonna comes off way to sexy for my 4 year old. Can't she just be quiet? Rosanne Cash is a gem and Bonnie Raitt is always good to hear. I thought REM had stopped whining back in the 90's! Anyway, If you want my copy, go to the used section."
5,"Smart, Fun Music for a Good Cause","The songs are more interesting than your average children's music, and the profits go to support early childhood education."
4,Praise for Ghost of Little Fawn,"Wow! This story of mystery, hope and love was engaging from the beginning to the end. A really great find. Original and well-written."
3,Not really impressed,"I can't say I'm really thrilled with this CD, the tracks tend to sound really similar. Nothing really grabbed me."
5,Life with Par,"Even if you don't golf, this is the cutest book. As you can see by the cover, wouldn't it be funny to swing your club, only to get it caught in your pocket? Or try to explain that a snake swallowed your golf ball coz you were the only one who saw it crawl away with a ""ball"" belly? Or an old gold miner who has turned to mining for balls in a golf course pond? Really cute depictions? Wouldn't it be cute if he was recognized all over again by the Sunday Funny Papers?"
1,What kind of novel is this?,"I know: Dean Wesley Smith can write good books. He proved this with ""The Tenth Planet"", which are excellent novels. But this one, I don't know. Is it serious? If so it is trashy. Is it parody (which for the sake of D.W.Smith I hope)? If so it is a bore. The dialogues are clichée, the humour is sitcom fastfood, and where for goodness sakes is there a climax, or even a moderate suspense? The book reflects the taste of fast digesting readers in our fast reading societies, where we find this kind of literature that seems prefabricated to exactly satisfy a taste generated by mass media, which - in addition - is accepted without thinking!I will read another MiB by D.W. Smith, because I think he can be much better. And I hope it will be better."
5,Perfect fit! Great value! Really Protects your carpet!,"Installed this liner in the back of my 2005 Toyota Sequoia. Perfect fit! Takes less than 5 minutes to cut the slots for the removable 3rd row seats. Now I can install and remove the seats without removing the liner. Heavy duty material protects nicely. Easy to pull out and hose off when necessary. I've carried soil, lumber, and other materials without getting my vehicle/carpet dirty. I should have bought this sooner before I stained part of the carpet. Great value!"
5,The Poet and the Murderer by Simon Worrall,"This is a fantastic first book from Simon Worrall. The life of Mark Hofmann with his skills as a forger, contempt of his religion and his heinious murders engross you. Simon Worrall keeps you glued to the pages all the way through. I love true crime..this is my favourite to date."
2,the poet and the murderer,I found it very hard to keep my iinterest. Very little about the murder and lots of other information that I found hard to follow.
3,The Poet and the murderer,Extremely good insights in what drives a person to forge a painting or any item that can create a great influence. Greed well exposed.
2,Dull writing,"The book caught my interest at first, but it didn't keep it. A lot of it seemed like padding. Pages and pages of the history of literary forgery got in the way of the story."
4,Forgery Explained,"I found it be a terrific book, well written, flowing, and plenty of information about forgeries and past histories. If nothing else, I discovered plenty of information on Emily, her family, and the area and climate around her home. There's always been plenty of information about Mormonism, and it's to the individual ot make up his/her mind about the religious aspects. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others."
2,Bad Midwife of a Story with GREAT Potential,"The only reason I think this book warrants two stars instead of one is because at least Worrall had the sense to recognize a story rich with possibilities. His ""Wikipedia"" version, though, is disappointing. Worrall spends way too much time practicing cheap psychology, repeating cheesy pet phrases (ex. ""Hofmann was beginning to sense the thin line separating reality from illusion""), and way too little time on the key elements of the tale. There are significant connections to be made from this intersection of poetry, Mormonism, and murder!! But he DOES NOT make them. It's still a fun read, but ultimately disappointing. I really wish someone with more scholarly dedication had written this book - it should have been about 500 pages long and intensively researched, and NOT dumbed down for the reader. See ""Death of Innocents"" for a good example of what true-crime nonfiction can be."
3,the poet and the murderer,"it had to many examples of wrong doing, to drawn out could have had more info on Hoffmanand his wrong doings"
3,So-so representation,"While this book presents the basic facts of the case and makes some interesting swipes at Sotheby's, it plays a little fast-and-loose wiht the facts about Emily Dickinson. Some of them, her death-date for example, are incorrect or are based on very limited research. The allegations about Dickinson's sister-in-law are taken from a one-sided source and are not supported by more recent research. A great deal of the ""facts"" surrounding the Dickinsons is taken from gossip. This is an interesting read and certainly makes one think hard about the world of manuscript sales but it lacks the true feel of a detective story. It reads like a piece of journalism, which it is really, that is trying to be a more academic or scholarly piece. The portrayal of Dan Lombardo makes him seem more of a character rather than the decent human being he is."
2,how much is true?,"Being more than passingly familiar with Mormon history, culture, and theology I can say unequivocally that much of the information about the LDS church in this book is wrong. And I do not mean matters of opinion or interpretation, but matters of vertifiable fact, historic and otherwise.And so I wonder if Worrall's information about Emily Dickinson, the Jones Library, and other people and places is equally inaccurate. One tends to believe that a writer who is careless in one area is likely to be equally sloppy in others, resulting in an unfortunate lack of credibility for the entire work. Too bad, because it's a pretty good story -- but like a Hofmann forgery, I am left to wonder which parts are true and which are false."
2,Didn't Meet Expectations.,"I was a little disappointed with the content of this book. I was expecting much more on Mark Hoffman's literary forgeries. Instead, we get a short introduction to the Dickinson forgery, and then almost 200 pages on his Mormon forgeries, which have been covered in much detail in other books. In addition, his description of the Mormon church is rather lousy and reads more like an anti-Mormon tract. It appears his source for Mormon ""history"" and ""theology"" come from Sandra Tanner, a well known anti-Mormon propagandist, whom he thanks at the end of the book. If the author had delved more into the lesser known forgeries, the book would have been much better."
3,Who edited this book?,"Who edited this book? Anyone? That's what I thought. While the story is interesting, the prolific punctuation and grammatical errors throughout the book are to the point of distraction. Very unprofessional.And although the title and beginning chapters lead us to believe the book is about Hoffman and Emily Dickinson, the book quickly turns into a character assisnation of the Mormon church rather than sticking to facts about Hoffman and his forgeries. I am not a Mormon but I think I might be offended if I were. I have a sneaking suspicion that Mr. Worrell is a lapsed Mormon."
3,Poet and Murderer,"The Poet and the Murderer has an intriguing premise ... the discovery of a possible Emily Dickinson poem.Problems arise with provenance, with the historical forger implicated, and worse.Some of the back story needs checking ... the trip to Italy in the middle of an earth-changing discovery does not make sense..just as a Sicilian family having stayed in touch with relatives from Northern Italy, etc. and the ""trip of a lifetime"" to the placewhere the father was apparently devastated... I will not go on.This work is a start, but needs strong editing and most of all - focus."
2,Poor Writing & Editing Detract From a Story That Often Goes Astray,"Luckily I didn't pay for this book, or otherwise I would be disappointed. I'm reading the Kindle edition. The text is so riddled with typos, which detract from the writing. Sometimes there are several errors on one page. This volume might have been edited by a group of high-school students.I downloaded the book to read about the Dickinson forgery, but there are large sections about the history of the Mormon church and instances of forgery throughout history. I'll agree with another reviewer who wrote that this was a magazine article puffed out to make a book-length piece."
4,Didn't finish,Author missed a chance to write a much more interesting book. He got bogged down in pointing out flaws and weaknesses of Mormon church and completely left the story.
2,Poet and Murderer,"Both my husband and myself tried to read the book, but found it too boring. Too much about poetry, not enough mystery.Kit T."
1,Waste of paper & ink....silly and boring.,"I couldn't force myself to become interested in this ""story"" which made no sense. Maybe I missed the intent, but entire idea was silly."
2,"hack job, needs work","This book has either been rushed into print, or simply rushed. There are so many typos and repetitions that clearly a competent proof-reader or editor were not involved in its production. The book's subtitle says ""A True Story of Literary Crime and The Art of Forgery"" but the copyright and publisher's blurb states categorically that ""This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, brands, media and incidents are either the product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously.""The book assembles a series of factoids about literary forgers, suitable for a newspaper article or Wikipedia, but tries to justify the title by mentioning Emily Dickinson and other real writers from time to time. It's a speedy read, no new content and unless you need a beginner's book on literary forgers, there are much better books about."
2,Not a completely horrible read,"The material about the non-Mormon forged documents is interesting, but the previously reported information about the Mormon-related forgeries was mostly derivative even to the point of perpetuating the same errors and prejudices from other books on the subject.Additionally, the author sometimes shows an ambigous feeling about the criminal to the point of actually excusing his criminal acts on his being raised a Mormon. The fact is, criminals are criminal by choice and nothing can excuse someone who perpetuated the fraud, forgeries and murder that Mark Hofmann chose to do."
3,Good book but a biased view of mormonism,"I found this book very interesting. Looking at Hofmann's non-mormon forgeries was great. I also liked looking at the exciting and sometimes dark world of auction houses.My main problem was the author didn't give a balanced view of mormonism. This book could be very offensive to members of the mormon church. He misquoted Lucy Smith, had dates about masonry incorrect, and other glaring mistakes. He did not include a bibliography, but if he did I'm sure it would show his research was from anti-mormon sources.A good book as long as you can ignore his biased view."
5,Blind Trust (second chance series #3),"again, Terri has given me a new type of book to read.. I'm not limited to one style or one content"
3,Fast Moving Suspense,"The book is certainly action packed with a lot of twists and turns to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. At times it is overly dramatic, however, and too far removed from reality. Blind Trust is a ""second chance"" remake of what was apparently a trashy romance novel and has most likely come a long way, but still has romance novel baggage. It does offer a good moral lesson; not to presume or jump to conclusions about another person when you don't know all the facts."
5,You Were Born on a Rotten Day,GREAT SERVICE!!!!The book came one day earlier than expected and it was in better condition than I had expected.5 STARS for sure to this seller.
1,Beware metal,"After about 7 uses I realized the metal tip is scratching my rims.Look for a plastic or wood brush, or one with a plastic cover over the tip of the metal brush."
2,So So Bottle Jack,"The Jack seems to be working with in the peramerters but it does not raise the vehicle high enough to remove the tires off, but is good to get some lift to put jack stands in order to have additional room for a oil change."
3,It works.,This is a rather cheap jack. Goes up and down pretty good though.After very little use it has already started to bleed down on its own.I like the double handle it comes with.
2,Jack quality,Jacks lift just as expected but after very very minimal use the jacks bleed off by themselves even when I ensured that they were tight. I am using them for stabilizing the corners of a camping trailer the jacks would be perfect if they didn't bleed off it is a pain in the neck to have to make sure they are still pumped up everyday and this was only the second time I used them.But for the record amazon did an awesome job with the shipping as always.
5,Efficient,Fast receiving and great products. I use them for to lift my fifth wheel just enough for to have à gap between the wheels and the ground.
4,Expressive & Great Listening!,"I think that the album is a journey through creative style and is personable to the artist. Words are base from the heart of the group. I would like to see an another album produce, because it would definitely buy it. It a little alternative / pop. An unique style compare to no others. Best regards, Geno"
1,Big let down.,"I had read that Monin grenadine contained ""No artificial coloring or preservatives"" as stated in the product description and other websites had stated the same thing. Not true at all. I just received my bottle in the mail and read the ingredients on the side, there is nothing natural about this except the sugar. Loaded with red 40 dye and artificial flavoring. If you are looking for a grenadine that won't dye your insides red I suggest making it from scratch."
1,what the EF!,"The item pictured in this review is the item that was shipped. It is not the item that was advertised and is no good to me. I see they did change the pic though, you really should picture the item you are selling! LOL"
1,Unreal,"I am an editor, my husband a budding writer. We both slogged our way through this travesty of a publication for the learning experience. Although he despises it, my husband is reading every word so he knows exactly how NOT to write his own novel. Bad sentence structure, bad grammar, misuse of words, no knowledge of punctuation, no flow to the language or the story, inappropriate metaphors. Whoever published this should be ashamed of their editing board, and should increase the expectation of 'polish' required of their authors' manuscripts before submission. Our single star rating would be a negative five if permitted. If the author shows so little caring for his own work, why should any reader feel compelled to read it?"
1,Wish I could give it zero stars,"The spelling errors were distracting. Thankfully, I got this from the library and didn't waste money, but I sure wasted time. I haven't put a book down in years, but it was so painful that I couldn't finish it. A good first attempt by the author, but desperately in need of professional guidance."
2,Amateurish effort,"I purchased a copy of the book from the author while he was in the Eugene ""Barnes and Noble"". It was riddled with typos, mispellings, and grammatical errors.I enjoyed it as a quick read, but the characters and plot were quite unconvincing."
1,Proofreading Would Have Been Nice,"I have never purchased a book so in need of an effective proofreader. Spelling errors, grammatical errors and printing errors abound and detract from an unusual and unlikely effort not worthy of a high school creative writing class."
5,Heartstopping thriller. The action never ends.,"I loved this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. The characters are well drawn and real, the situations intense and terrifying. Enjoy!"
4,"Great story, but....","I loved the story and could not put the book down.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of fiveis because of the lack of editing: spelling, punctuation,words omitted... normally, I don't mind a few errors hereand there, but Four Crows was loaded with them."
2,Unfortunately this is not a very helpful book,"I had hoped that this would be an extension of Shigeo Shingo's ""A Revolution in Manufacturing: The SMED System,"" but unfortunately it is not really helpful. The writing is convoluted. The translation could be better. I didn't find anything in this book that wasn't explained much more clearly in Shingo's book."
4,Cost Improvement,I am using this book as my text book for the SMED training I am teaching in differents industriesVery good for reference and examples
5,Unique collectible for Diana fans,"This album is an unusual collectible, sure to be appreciated by Diana's fans! It was very well written, held my attention, and the illustrations were detailed and some of the best I've seen. I'ts obvious, much time and research went into this book, written with heartfelt admiration for Diana. This author has two other books I've also purchased, that are equally enjoyable."
3,I was disappointed by this book!!,"I was looking for a book with tips about fashion, make-up, tips for saving time but what I got was a health book!! It is true most of the book is about exercising and eating healthy which is good if that is what you wanted but I have enough of these books at home. Only the last two chapters had what i really bought it for. I did like the cute drawings and the vibrant colors of the pages but really as a health book it's good but as a beauty guide it fails!!!!!! The explanation of the book makes it sound better than it really is!!!"
2,"Pretty book, light on content","I bought this book hoping to find lots of tips, but I was pretty disappointed. If you've read about five women's magazines in your life, you will have already read most of the tips here- like how to make your own face masks out of oatmeal and honey etc. The pictures are pretty though.I enjoyed 'Three Black Skirts- everything you need to survive' a lot better, and it had more useful advice."
4,very cute book,"I thought it was charming. The pictures were cute and the advice pretty good, especially about eating healthy. I have a tendancy to eat lots of junk food on the run, and it offered easy solutions to combat this. I also liked the fashion section, but skipped the exercise section because I don't exercise. I recommend it."
1,I sent them back,"I sent these sunglasses back. I didn't like the shape or the color of the lenses. That was my subjective opinion of them. The company was a pleasure to work with. They refunded my money in a very timely fashion. I would say though that I learned a lesson, it it tough to shop for sunglasses online because you really do need to see what they will look like on your face. I usually buy Revo or Vuarnet because I know the shape I like and the type of lens. I thought I would try something new, but...Again the company is great so don't let my opinion about the glasses sway you.Caron"
2,Very Disappointing,"After seeing that this book had 5 stars I decided to buy it. I was very disappointed. There were grammatical areas as well as typos. The story line itself was okay but the words just didn't flow. I could not get into it. This, I believe was the author's first book, so maybe her writing skills will improve with time. Although I didn't enjoy the book, the message was a good one, of God's forgivness and how we are suppossed to forgive one another, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
3,"Light, but entertaining","Various comic characters from different countries gather for a road rally through Europe in the 20's, setting the stage for plenty of good-natured, family friendly hijinks. The international cast (including Tony Curtis and the wonderful Terry-Thomas) is very good. Although lightweight, the story moves along at a good pace. If you enjoy the kind of madcap comedies with large ensemble casts that were made so often in the 60's (think ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World""), you'll probably get a kick out of this."
3,I thought I ordered a DVD and not a VHS,"probably my mistake, but I can't use anymore a VHS, unfortunately useless and too expensive to send back. thanks and regards, Raymund Kennel"
5,Very informational,I thought the information was so important I ordered a second copy for a friend who lives in the bible belt. Just the reference to the Treaty of Tripoli makes the purchase well worth the money.
4,Logical and straightforward,"The author has provided easy to understand arguments, based on science and logic, to explain why the Christian belief in God and creation are incorrect. Each chapter addresses a topic of current interest in today's world which keeps your attention. I enjoyed the writing style."
4,Well written and concise,This is truly one of those page-turners. Simple yet deep in places. I highly recommend this book if you're just starting out in atheist research. There are lots of little factual tidbits that I found interesting. My only complaint is that I would have liked Mr. Mills to have actually gone into more detail since his opinions were so well thoughtout. Read this book in conjunction with KENNETH C. DAVIS' DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE BIBLE.
5,What an Awesome Book!,This book is great! It has such a logical approach to religion. Anyone who is exploring their true religion should read this book!
4,Labored,"Certainly thought provoking, but this is 'heavy' reading - rather labored. But - then - so is Dawkins' ""God Delusion"". Between them they lay out most of the arguments, and should be read carefully, whether you choose to agree or not."
4,Good job of explaining science,"The biggest problem with modern science is that it has reached a level of complexity that requires better than average intelligence to understand it. However, fifty percent of us are below average in intelligence by definition of a normal curve. Thus, often we have to take what scientists tell us ""on faith."" How, we may ask, is that different from taking god ""on faith?""This book does a good job of explaining science in plain English for those of us who are ""scientifically challenged."" I liked the non mathematical plain English explanation of the ""Big Bang."" Even so, I am ""taking on faith"" that scientists have discovered that, even in a perfect vacuum, random electromagnentic oscillations are present. I find that fascinating. From this derives all."
5,Five stars is not enough.,"I think this book is not only for atheists. It's even great for spiritual seekers (what I consider myself to be) who dislike dogmatic religious views.Once you start reading it, it's hard to put it down. Very highly recommended."
3,mostly good and fairly easy to read,"I have only one gripe with this book. Mills says the only difference between an atheist and an agnostic is guts. That cliched opinion never fails to piss me off. I am an atheist now, but I was agnostic for many years before I was ready to say no to all gods. I had to read and think a lot before making a final decision. There is nothing cowardly or wishy-washy about saying, ""I don't know."" According to ignorant fanatics, agnostics go to hell, too, so please people, show some respect for deep thinkers who are willing to admit that they just don't know."
1,the foreword was the best part!,"Although I do share many of the same views as the author, I found the format insulting to my intelligience. Before actually buying this book, I read the foreword (of this book), by Dorion Sagan. I was so impressed and laughing so much, that I could not wait to bring the book home. When I read the rest, I was extremely disappointed. The first chapter, ""Interview with an Athiest"", was neither entertaining nor informative. The rest of the book did not improve. It seemed more opinion based than factual. I agree with Joseph Izzo's review, that the logic was just plain silly; the kind that bores you, not entertains you."
4,Another Good book,"A very good book detailing both sides of an otherwise convoluted subject. Written for the average - laymen - person, I was able to comprehend the creationist position and its self-contradictions, as well as the strengths and clarity of scientific fact. What I took away form this very enjoyable read was that the short comings of blind faith and the philosophies that support it have no place in a class room especially a scientific one, nor in the running of a state; and most importantly, why."
4,"Great Book, But a Little Harsh","Let me start by saying that I am an atheist, and have been since I was 16 years old. This book is an excellent source of counter-arguments against Christian Fundamentalism, as the title states. My only problem is that the tone of the text is a little harsh. Most of my friends are Christian, and I've had a few interesting discussions with them as they try to convert me, but I always treat their views with respect, even if they don't return the courtesy. ""Atheist Universe"" is not so subtle, punching holes in Christian theory with a sledgehammer, instead of surgically dissecting it with a scalpel as I would have preferred. Still, if you need ammunition to debate a right-wing fundamentalist, this is a good place to start."
5,Skeptic,This book puts into print all the logical arguments against Creationism and exposes the flawed reasoning used by the Religious Right.
3,Good introduction but a little light on content,"Atheist Universe provides a fairly good introduction to atheism, but I would recommend a book that provides more depth such as Natural Atheism by David Eller. I have now read both books, and I felt that if I didn't have the background from reading Natural Atheism, I would have had a lot of questions after reading Atheist Universe. Also, I feel that Mills jumps around quite a bit in Atheist Universe and some chapters seem to have very little to do with his thesis (for instance the chapter on internet pornography). To be fair, Mills' book is much easier to read but again I feel it skimps on the content."
3,"Okay, but...",Much good material but debunking fundementalism is like hunting dairy cows with a scoped rifle; no real challenge there in that fundy is the weakest arguments.
1,Same old story of Atheism that is long on rant and short on factual data,"I read most of the book and became bored and didn't finish it. It is filled with the same ""scientific"" data, that all through it's accounts only rants against spirituality yet refutes none of it. The book makes the same fundamental error as most uneducated atheists. The book totally dismisses the possibility that God being a supernatural being has more power than the author. The author merely tries (failingly) to steer the reader into beleiving that humans must have the same power as God, and since we do not have the powers alluded to in Biblical and other writings, that God does not exist. The author also tries to deny God, since God cannot be proved by scientific methods, yet the author misses the idea fact that while God cannot be proven scientifically, God cannot be disproven either. Read the book if you can borrow it but save you money. It is long on laughable entertainment but short on reality."
1,well.....well......another case agianst god....,"even if there is GOD..NO David Mills, Richard Dawkin and others will never believe...i just read-----Atheist Universe: The Thinking Person's Answer to Christian Fundamentalism...waist of time and money..nobody cant say 100% that there is NO god...even--- Antony Flew (Professor of Philosophy, former atheist, author, and debater)said: ""It now seems to me that the findings of more than fifty years of DNA research have provided materials for a new and enormously powerful argument to design....ectAnthony Flew was a big atheist who debate Christians...."
4,"WELL ORGANIZED, UNDERSTANDABLE","Author David Mills writes with calm clarity that is rich with insight and understanding of evolutionary science. He pulls off the coating of misrepresented information and tells the truth with details. His prose style is easy and fluid. The reader is not overwhelmed with verbose scientific technical language. Most important, he does not apologize for or excuse the defenders of creationism for their sidewinding tactics. This is a refreshing read."
4,Very well argued case against religion,"Atheist Universe is a terrific book. Mills skewers creationists/advocates of ""intelligent design"" with solid logic and compelling arguments. I also liked the fact that Mills adds quotes by famous atheists from Freud to James Watson throughout the book. If you've ever encountered a pro-religious argument that you thought was absurd, but couldn't rebut, simply read this book. I think it's actually more persuasive than the God Delusion or God is Not Great. My one quibble is that I don't agree with Mills that Jesus was fictional; even Richard Dawkins concedes Jesus most likely existed. Notwithstanding this disagreement, I strongly recommend Atheist Universe to atheists and theists alike."
5,Alternative to other reads,"In a few short words, this book is a great (and interesting) alternative to other reads on the subject such as those written by Richard Dawkins. The writing is not the least bit defensive, but simply lays out great points. It is the best publication I've read on the subject to date."
5,A wonderful book,"A wonderful book. I have been reading the recent spate of books on atheism (Dawkins, Hitchens, Dennett, Harris) and this one is perhaps the most concise and at the same time comprehensive overview of the atheist outlook. Many great examples to help the reader gain a greater perspective of what it is to be an atheist. The ""interview"" at the beginning is a very strong start, and the book continues in the mind-expanding task of untying the corrupting tethers of religious belief and other absurdities."
4,Ron's Review,Easily one of the best of its type. Well organized and edited and to the point. Fast read. Hard to put down once you start reading. Layed out similar to an executive summary for a reader with limited time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
4,Mostly Effective,"I found it to be good basic info, a little slow at times. The last part on intelligent design was rather tedious. If you are just out of the church and need support to justify your new views this will be of great help to you."
5,Excellent choice,"I wanted four of these pans to make individual sticky rolls. I purchased one to test it to make sure that it would do the job for me. It was great, so I ordered three more. When my order arrived, two of the three were damaged. Replacement by Amazon could not have been any more prompt or satisfactory. I was very pleased with how it was handled and I love, love, love these pans. The sticky rolls release very easily and clean up is a breeze."
3,Very large muffins...,"Nice big cup size, makes great looking muffins, but NOT nonstick. Every drop of batter that touches the metal is a cleaning job later"
1,ZRODN,"man totally dysfunctional i left seeing this film wanting to pass out firearms registration cards, golds gyms memberships, and counseling assistance grants. i mean your in a circus got no car your moms part of the circus being beaten by your pa and your brother or cousin decides to abuse you sexually, what the hell is this nonsense. i mean totally disturbing im surprised this film didnt cause a riot outside the theatre. man i hope this nonsense is total fiction because if it occurs somewhere in the world even just once i would be like ok ill pay for the contract you pay for the rolled plastic and the cleaning bill for the trunk of a cadillac. i mean my version of the film would end under and hour with somebody being buried."
1,CIRCUS SNORE FEST.,This one is a total dud. Come on one David Lynch is enough. I'm assuming the director's pitch went something like this: It's Mullholland Drive at a carnival! That's assuming he saw Mullholland Drive or any films before he started directing.
5,A true work of art...,"This film is beyond amazing. The colors, the acting, the amazing twisted story all make for an amazing film. Ebert wasn't wrong to name it one of the top 10 films of the year. Mike Patton is a superb actor and i can only hope he does as much acting in the future as he has done music.To the guy who only gave it 1 star, stick to movies like Gladiator and Independance Day. Obviously you have a 1 track mind to not appreciate something as beautiful as this. And for the record Dennis Hopper didn't drop out, he got replaced by Mike. Watch this movie and be amazed."
5,Destined to be a cult classic.,"An odd and disturbing story about a murder in a small town in Kansas. The movie switches back and forth between black & white and color photography in a very impressive and memorable way, but the story line here ain't The Wizard of Oz! The music is great and runs throughout the film."
2,Bad acting kills great potential.,"Anyone calling this movie brilliant is either too obsessed with Patton or one of Balderson's paid employees. Yes, the opening is brilliant and the colors and style of this film are nothing short of fantastic. But Karen Black's performance is beyond emberassing, and Mike Patton even said himself he is no actor - and it shows.It was very uncomfortable and difficult to watch this film in its entirety, which is a real shame because it could have been an incredible experience. Instead the potential was shattered by phony acting. Sad to say it, but avoid this movie at all costs."
5,Disturbing...Disturbing...Disturbing...,"My boyfriend is a HUGE Mike Patton fan so we were thrilled to have seen it opening night of the tour in Boston! I had no idea what the movie was about or what I was getting myself into.The colors were just brilliant. Esthetically, the movie was the most beautiful I've ever seen. When people ask if I liked it or not, I just don't know what to say. Somehow the disturbing content just pops into my head first...but then I think of how wonderful it was visually. Kudo's to Mike and Karen's acting. I loved the symetry of characters (color = black and white counterparts). The scene at the end when Karen was running in the field; it was just like nothing I've ever seen on screen. All in all....I loved it."
2,Only for diehard patton fans,"The plot and pacing of this movie are terrible... Patton is great in one role, horrible in another... it is indeed painful to watch all of it. The movie cannot be compared to Lynch. Karen black is good in her roles. And I agree, the visuals are interesting, it is already a cult classic."
5,perfect playpen,this playpen is great my hamster smokey is a dwarf hamster and tries to climb out sometimes but can never succeed and can fit tons of his accessories to play with and an easy attachment hole to open and close and can easily add a wheel that connects to wire u should buy it
3,Watch your friend,"My hamster can climb out. It is cool when I am doing homework, and I like it. She can just climb out. SO watch your hammy. But my hamster loves it. Great, I kinda recommend it :DD"
2,Nope- two days until breakout!,"Our hamster is three weeks old, yet has figured out two ways of escaping, one which she is able to (quite readily) achieve right now, and the other once she grows just a little larger.The small black 'hole' that allows for tube extension (cleverly hidden in a convenient angle by the manufacturer) allows for a more adventurous climber to clamber up the side of the wall and get over the top. Imagine the surprise my girlfriend and I had when we were cleaning her cage and found her at our feet sniffing around! One misstep and that would've been the end of her.Also, once our hamster grows bigger, she'll be able to reach the top horizontal bar, thus giving her the ability to climb up from any side; even if we were to manage blocking off the black plastic escape, she'll soon be able to jail-break from any area on the fence perimeter when she grows large enough.I'll be returning this for the larger one.."
1,Worthless if you have a dwarf hamster!!!,I work for a popular pet store and have in three short months aquired 2 fancy mice and 2 chinese dwarf hamsters. I bought this playpen because I thought it would be fun for them to get out of their cages...my hamster figured out how to scale the wall in LITERALLY less than 5 minutes!!!
2,Too short to contain rodents,"I thought this might be a fun pen for my gerbils. They're pretty small and aren't jumpers, so it seemed nicer to put them in the pen while I clean their cage, rather than in their little travel cage. It worked a couple of times; but once the gerbils learned to climb over the side, they would immediately do so as soon as I put them in. So it's pretty useless for gerbils. Since some people report that it couldn't even contain their dwarf hamsters, I'm thinking this should be sold as a pen for turtles or something -- ?"
2,NOT FOR HAMSTERS unless they are of a smaller kind,My syrian hamster climbed right out of this within about 10 minutes and then he just kept climbing out.This prodcut should have been about 2-5 inches taller if its intended for hamsters. I wouldn't buy this again.
1,Waste of money,Our small hamster climbed out in less than 30 minutes...the mat is also a joke.... save your money our little girl is using it for her little pet shop toys
3,ehh,"This product is cute, but my mice could climb right out, and they chewed the mat up while I took my eye off them. It could be bigger, the mat could be different, and I wish my mice didnt figure out how to escape. It was okay though"
2,My guinea pig breaks out,"This is a nice pen, but my guinea pig gets his nose under it and pushes it up, and then runs away."
3,smaller than anticipated.,"I ordered this mini ex-pen for my hedgehog.It is smaller than i realized and i had to get another one (from a friend) to hook to it to give her adequate space to gambol about. I don't dislike it but i would like to be able to buy additional panels to add to it. The plastic mat that goes beneath is a nice feature unless, of course, you make it bigger than you don't have enough mat."
2,Too small,Will not work for a ferret if you are ordering it for a ferret don't waste your money they just leap over!!
3,Very small but still does the job,"The playpen is great but it is very small. You can purchase additional links to expand the size but height wise, most small animals would be able to escape from it. It has an opening so that it can be attached to a tube, which would make it great for hamsters or mice. And the mat is great, makes for easy clean up."
5,lotsa fun,Hamlet comes down the tube when he wants attention. Cool idea hope he can't figure out an escape.. Love it
1,Hamsters Can Easily Climb Out!,"Do NOT buy this product and attach to a cage! My hamster figured out how to hoist herself up the wire walls in less than ten minutes. To solve the problem, I tried to put a cover on top. She pushed the walls out until the cover fell down. She's lucky she wasn't squished. The last straw is when she started eating the green mat. Totally not worth the aggravation."
2,need like 2 or 3 for hedgehogs,i got this so my hedgie (apple) can run around outside of his cage and we can bond better and i wont have to worry about him falling off the bed or running under it if we sit on the floor it works ok tho i would need 2 for a small area for a hedgie tho it suits us just fine for the moment use it sometimes for outside like smoking a cigarette and he can play in the yard but this is for REALLY REALLY SMALL ANIMALS LIKE ROBO HAMSTERS AND STUFF NOTHING BIGGER THAN A SMALL HAMSTERS
1,do not suggest for anything bigger than a hamster.,"This says it is a ferret cage, but my ferret quickly discovered how to escape. The panels must be, at max, 5 inches tall. Do not buy this for a ferret or a gerbil, they will escape. When I first got it the hole for the clip wouldn't work either, it was too small and the hole was damaged like someone tried to make the hole bigger and peeled off the paint and bent the metal."
2,not what I expected,"""cage"" was VERY small (when assembled, about 18 inches in diameter. I need at least 2 more to do what I need it to do, and should have spent the money for a bigger one from the get-go"
1,outdated,"The exam this book covers expires in two months. The book i recieved was heavily marked up, and the price should have reflected ""totally #$%! used"""
4,This is the truth of an individual.,"Well, I've read this book in Korean and I'm not deeply read in his theories but as I read this, I couldn't help feeling sorrow. What a peculiar life as a human being , let alone as a philosopher! Whatever they say about the man, to me he seems a vulnerable human being and the victim to a wrong network of human interaction. Think of what this man could have avoided in his life...( Someone might ask ""How?"" ) Why and how he had to murder his wife will remain a forever mystery. He's dead but I want to pray for him while I'm alive."
5,Engelbert Humperdinck - Engelbert Live (Bonus CD),"This is by far the best of his DVD. In fact, I owned 3 of this DVD. My last purchase was because I wanted the CD, so that I can listen sometimes without watching the DVD. I can listen/watch it without getting tired of it. In fact, the more I play it, the more you appreciate & enjoy what a great singer Engelbert is ! This is a highly recommended DVD for everyone."
4,Good,"Engelbert Humperdinck, a name synonymous with other greats like Andy Williams, Tom Jones etc. Dubbed the King of Romance, is especially true with an exceptional voice which undoubtedly takes you to another world altogether.This is the first DVD I have picked up of EH and find it extremely good. Most of the renditions of the songs are signature EH,but I was a little disappointed with the rendition of ""the shadow of your smile"". This is worth a buy as it also comes with the CD."
2,"OK, BUT DISSAPOINTING....","I BOUGHT THIS AFTERBUYING TOTALLY AMAZING (2006) WHICHIS JUST INCREDIBLE,Much better than hewas in 1995!Lots offlat notes, and i Dont care for Michelina at all.Not to take anythingaway from Enge, thisconcert has its moments, but after Totally amazing, i really see hes so much better with age.I was taken by surprise in the 1995interview how old heseems in comparison to his stage appearence. Make up magic i guess. He looks better now!All in all ill say again OK,Just ok, but dissapointing.Get Totally Amazing instead, you will be amazed. Skip this one."
1,Doesn't work as expected...,"This light control was advertised to work with frosted glass, but after the first night, it failed to turn on at the configured time (dusk). We may use it somewhere else, but it failed in the purpose for which it was purchased."
1,Does Not Work,"It does not predicably turn on after dark or turn off.I should have avoided this product: 1) with cheap electronics, just getting one with a light sensor that works is often problematic;2) add'l ""features,"" e.g., light sensitivity button & 1-6 hr turn-off TRIPLE the chances it'll be defective.And too inexpensive to go through the hassle of return, possible charges etc."
5,I love these,"I have two street lamps style fixtures that are not connected to any switches. I only wanted the lights to be on for a few hours in the evening. These perform that exact function. They turn on at sunset and turn off several hours later depending on the timer setting. I like that the timer is adjustable, so you can set it for longer during winter months."
4,"brutal, brutal and more brutal","This is some serious death/grind. Not for posers,and definitely not for the faint-hearted. For serious death connoiseurs only!! I picked this album up from a local death/grind music store that sells nothing but the best underground death metal. What drew me to it was the cover art, a man about to slash a woman's throat, I was like if the cover art looks like this, then the music must be just as brutal. I was not let down, it has been in my CD rotation for the past month and I can't stop listening to it. Brutal vocals set to crazy, brutal riffs. AWESOME!! buy it already..."
2,Do not buy! Will fail extremely fast and cost you more!,"I bought a Beltronics 995 just over a year ago. I went on a trip last week and the unit started showing KA band the entire time. I tried to unplug the unit and then turn it back on and within five minutes the KA band will come back on and just continue to beep for hours on end. I called Beltronics and they charge 60 dollars just to look at it. This unit has never been abused. It sits on my windshield of my truck and is parked in my garage! I could not believe how terrible the customer service from Beltronics is. To pay 300 dollars for one of the ""so called best"" units and have it only work for a little over a year is unacceptable. I am warning everyone out there not to buy this product. Yes it worked great when it worked. But you will not be satisfied with how long it lasts. I am extremely meticulous so don't think this unit was thrown around.GO to a different brand all together than Beltronics!!!!!"
5,Just buy it- BEST deal,"No long review here, just going to say for the current price this is the best deal there is right now on a quality RD. The thing works great, seems to be very well built and has some nice features. I love the MUTE button on the smart plug, and the way the auto-mute system works is great. The things I wish it had are more controls on the smartcord (darkmode maybe?), and I wish it had a visual meter in tec mode. There still is the audio meter in tec mode so that isn't a huge problem. I CALLED BELTRONICS and the said they DO honor their warranty if bought at Amazon, but not if it is purchased through an independent merchant on Amazon. Call them yourself if you are worried about it, you'll see.Edit- Aug. 29th 2010.. Still going strong. These people with complaints about warranty and reliability are full of (you know what). They probably got their 995 off some e-bay clown, or something. Who knows if they even really have a Bell radar detector at all. Mine works great."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,"Product failed after only 2 years. Beltronics quality has gone downhill.Do not buy, unless you only need it for a short time."
1,beltronic v955 is a piece fo JUNK,I purchased the beltronic v995 in july 2010 and got two speeding tickets already and some times i can see the cop car before it alerted the ka band.
3,chevyguy,"I bought this unit for use in eastern Europe. It works as advertised. I have used it in Europe and the western States of America and am happy with the detection range and control features. However, Bel does not honor their warranty because I did not buy it directly from them and pay their exhorbitant price. I got the detector in the factory package just as advertised."
2,after 6 months not satisiied,"I have bought this radar 6 months ago it is my first , I am not satisified with it with , it doesnt pick up many police cars except when I pass it and they would be standing giving tickets to others , I returned it to the company to fix it they said their was couple of issues part of it was with antenna and still it has the same the problem I called the company again they were rude and said there is nothing wrong with it and it is the way the police put its radar gun in car so in certain positions in the car it cant pick it up which if true it means the police radar can pick you up while u dont c it except when it is late and this is the issue with this radar as per their own tech which I think is a big minus and makes it useless specially with such expensive price"
1,2 Tickets So Far,Don't get this unit! My friend was borrowing it and got a ticket and I just got another ticket with it. It alerted me after I had already seen the cop and started slowing down and my friend was never alerted. DON'T BUY!
3,Beltronics Vector 995 Radar and Laser Detector,"this product is good, except for giving false laseralerts when the sun shines directly into the front.Beltronics Vector 995 Radar and Laser Detector"
4,Secure,The booklet could provide more information re the various kinds of radar signals. But the bigger problem is that the radar detector won't stay on the suction cup hook attached to the windshield. It was constantly FLYING off.
5,Very Satisfied,"Beltronics V995 Vector Radar and Laser Detector (Black/Silver)Very pleased with the products. Comes in a nice case to store but so far have not wanted to. Alwaysin use. Drive 82 miles one way to work every day and make several trips to Nashville to see ourchildren which is over 4 hours away. Have had a V955 for 4 years now and love it so decided to purchasethis model for our children. Purchased 4 detectors and was hoping with the amount of money spenton the kids that they would appreciate it. They all love them and they in turn have a lot of time on the roads.It is a quality unit and works very well, would recommend to anyone. Well worth the money."
5,Great Detector,"The V995 is a serious detector, a cut above and clearly superior to lower priced units such as Whistler's XTR-690SE. The V995 is a quiet detector, very few false alarms with this unit to date yet sensitivity is very good. Blazing FAST shipment from Amazon."
4,works well,product works MUCH better than the 5 year old bel that i had. not sure how it compares to the other new models. False alarms are almost non-existent.
2,Good detector but horrible reliablity,"I have a 2 units of the 995 and the RX65- all high end detectors from Beltronics. Got all three within a year time span and after 1.5-2years, they start saying ""Service required"" calibration issue. Looks like this a common problem with their high end detectors. Had to send 2 of the units in for repair and my last unit went out with the same problem.The detectors work great when they dont have this issue."
2,Beeps constantly!!!,"The advertisement for this detector was that it could filter out traffic Radar. This damn thing goes off my entire drive to work!I have learned to somewhat ignore it, but one day I am going to ignore it and it's going to cost me!"
4,review,The radar works well on highways. Since I bought a refurbished one it resets itself every 20 mins or so which can get a bit annoying. Other than that it works very well. Very few false alerts with very good detection.
3,Fair,"Does not see radar/laser quickly enough. Sometimes it totally misses it. I sent it back and bought an Escort Passport instead. A much better unit, and close to the same price."
1,Disappointed!,"I got the 995 a few weeks ago to replace my old Bel 935, which after 6 years was starting to have some issues. I didn't need anything too sophisticated, so I had researched various brands, from the ultra pricey to the bare minimums, including escort, valentine, whistler and cobra, and still always came back to Bel. The 995 had great reviews, but I found it to be so ultra sensitive that it was going off constantly! My area uses K band all over, not X, and there is no way to lower the sensitivity for K, like you can do for the X band. I was constantly muting it, and never knew when I was hearing a real radar alert or a false alarm. I was very disappointed in the performance of the 995, and am sending it back."
5,Great value for the money,"I am very happy with this Beltroncs Vector V995 radar detector. It has been giving me good service since early December. I like to use it when I am just driving around the neighborhood and local trips because it alerts me to HCSO deputies cruising around looking for someone to not come to a complete stop. They leave their radar guns on at all times, so I always know when I am getting near to them. If the radar detector is not going off sometimes I choose to not stop completely. On the highway it has excelled as well. I hear about other detectors that are more high-end and cost $200-250 more. I cannot imagine them being any better than the Beltronics V995 unless they can either disable radar or provide a cloaking device for your vehicle. Speed on, brother!!"
5,Best thing I ever purchased!!!,After a couple months of looking at reviews for a bunch of radar detectors I decided to go with Beltronics Vector V995.That was the best decision and item I've ever purchased. It has saved me so many times and keeps surprising me after two long years with it.I keep mine on highway and it does a good job picking up all Ka bands and fewer X and K bands.I would/do recommend this to anyone who wants to never get a ticket again. :)p.s. If you do get pulled over make sure you take it down and unplug it.Even if it's legal cops will try and give you a hard time about it.
3,Does not stay attached to windshield...,I like the radar detector but the attachment is horrible...The whole unit slips out when the car stops or takes off..
5,One of the better less expensive detectors out there.,"This detector is basically the same as the escort passport 8500, but less expensive. For the money, you can't go wrong buying this one."
5,Item great purchase terrible.,"Item is outstanding, the merchant, Barneys Electronics, the only place I used my credit card for a purchase and my card # was stolen, hijacked. Sometimes the lowest price is not always the best deal."
4,Ticket Saving Device,"The company needs to be more thorough in giving the purchaser the full info with regards to the merchandise being shipped. I had to go to them to get the tracking info to find out when I would be receiving my item. When I received it, I wasn't all too impressed with the packing that was done to protect my purchase. I used to work for UPS, so I know how things are handled there. For the most part, I am very satisfied with my purchase. It was by far the cheapest and the reviews were very clear on the shipper and the product."
2,Far From The Best,"I purchased this unit to replace my aging Escort 8500; fiscally it made sense rather than repairing a four year old device. I made a mistake. The sensitivity of the V995 is quite lacking. Here in NJ, each toll barrier uses a K or Ka based radar setup to clock vehicles approaching the EZ Pass toll lanes. The Escort always supplied advance warnings. The Bel V995 does not so much as give any alert whatsoever. What sealed the deal on this conclusion was persuading a Police Officer friend of mine to do a test with the Ka band unit in his patrol car. The margin of warning was acceptable so, perhaps, it is filtering out the signals I just mentioned and that is most welcome.. A new Escort 8500 can be had via Amazon for $272.00. You get what you pay for."
5,Childhood Classic!!,"This book was my childhood favorite and I still love it! The storyline is fun and the pictures are cute. Even years later, I still remember and cherish this book because of its simplicity and uniqueness. Definitely a must-have for anyone with kids!"
3,not much lip,not much to rate. i thought it would have more of a spill control type design. it is more of a carpet protector for dry stuff. we carry paint cans frequently...
5,tmnt,Bought this for my nephew and he can't stop watching it. It's amazing. I haven't had any problems with it
5,COWABUNGA DUDE!,"My girlfriend gave me this for my birthday. It is awesome!As someone who grew up watching this cartoon all the time and is my favorite as a kid, this is the best present I have received. It was pretty funny at the beginning when she gave it to me because I thought it was a toy and didn't know it had all the seasons inside. If you are a TMNT fan I recommend this collectors edition as a must have."
5,Original Series!!,"The packaging for this is a really nice throwback to the toys and obviously the turtle van. The inside of this case is a hard foam and is what the dvd's rest on. If you are buying this and have kids the dvd's are exposed when the lid or top half of the van is open. Just in case you do not want fingerprints on them. Overall a great product, simple dvd menus for each dvd kind of take away the wow factor of this, but hey it is not a vhs collection it is the whole first original series on dvd. If you are a fan buy it if not i'm sure one day this will be a collectors item."
4,Almost Perfect,"I know the van is awesome and I love how the wheels actually spin, but Id rather have a more traditional box for the complete set, id even go as far as to buy an officially licensed empty replacement box that was more like The Real Ghostbusters Complete Series, other than that though I couldnt be happier, ive been holding off on buying the season dvds because of hopes of a complete box and it payed off."
1,Love the show but,the episodes being out of order and the fact that season 4 episode 3 will not play cause me to give this a low rating. the episode plays half way then freezes up. skip ahead and it freezes again.
3,over all it's okay,"That's really all I can say about the show. As a kid I did grow up with this show a little, but I mostly grew up watching the three live action movies more so than this show. When in comparison to say the comic books, the original source of this show, it feels, a bit of a let down to how some of the characters were turned into, I felt it just wasn't a good adaption... imagine like how many people feels when they get a terrible live action movie adaptation of their favorite show... it's like thatIt's an overall okay show on it's own accord, perhaps a bit one too many episodes for my taste, but hey, that's what popularity gets you. It feels like an eighties show, and that is hit and miss with me most of the time ie. I think Gavan (1981) is a great show, but I think stuff like Thundercats was pretty blandas a Ninja Turtles fan, I will be happy to add this to my growing collection... now only to wish Nick will do a complete set of the 2003 show.I give it 3/5"
4,ninja turtles,My boyfriend loved it when I got it for him for his 30th birthday. It brought back memories from when he was a little boy.
4,Love it....but,"The van case....amazing. The show and its entirety....incredible. The fun factor......priceless. This is a great set, unfortunately the box it came in was pretty bent up so its hard to display which gives it 4 not 5. If you don't care about the box this is your set."
4,good condition,i saw the teenage mutant ninja turtles the complete classic series collection the box came in perfect condition and i like it i saw sea 1-6 and i give it 5 stars no problems and sea 7-10 no problems either if i had a problem with the discs i would replace it with another one from amazon but it works fine if dvd skips and not work you need to clean out your dvd player with memorax cd cleaner and if dv has smudges on it use a glass cloth and glass cleaner to clean disc to make it work in conclusion this is a good dvd i am a turle fan since 1987 i think i buy another product from the buyer
3,Disappointing.,"This set is disappointing for several reasons. Firstly, as cool as the packaging is, it's just not practical. Where the hell is somebody supposed to put that thing? The bigger issue though is that there's nothing new included here. There aren't any new special features, and the errors in episode orders throughout some of the seasons are incorrect. This is an entertaining show, but they could have improved this a bit more."
4,great set,"its a nice set, very fun and creative but the packaging isn't that great. when i received this item all the discs had fallen out of their positions. thankfully non were damaged but having to take them all out and put them back in one by one was a bit annoying,"
1,HATE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GARBAGE, YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT WHAT THE 5% NATION OF ISLAM TEACHES IT'S FOLLOWERS! THEY HATE WHITE PEOPLE AND BELIEVE THAT A ""MOTHERSHIP WILL RETURN TO PICK THEM UP""???? MOSTLY KNOWN AS A GANG IN THE PRISON SYSTEMS (AT LEAST IN SC), THEY HAVE BEEN DECLARED A SECURITY THREAT GROUP AND LOCKED UP. MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION ABOUT THE MUSIC, JUST RESEARCH THE BACKGROUND BEFORE YOU SUPPORT THIS NONSENSE........."
5,THE GODS ARE HERE,"Peace to all civilized people! This album shows the positive and creative side of the original man. When we say we are GOD, what we mean is we are not GOD over anyone but self. The GOD do believe in a supreme being, that GOD is a higher form of self. Look in the Holy Bible, Jesus himself said ""ye are GODS!"" Lord Jamar is doing nothing but showing and proving that GOD is within him by dropping science on the Blind, Deaf, and Dumb.We teach what is not taught in schoolsWe don't ask for a dime in ciphers for offering to GOD! Thus why we are called poor righteous teachers.We teach the truth and show and prove it by research. In all sciences.We teach the origins of civilization and back it up!WE ARE NOT PRO-BLACK NOR ANTI WHITE!! There are white five percenters. They understand through research of how they were grafted.GOD IS TRUE AND LIVING!! NOT SOMEONE YOU CANNOT SEE UNTIL YOU DIE!"
5,Exactly what was described,The pad arrived quickly and is exactly what I was expecting. My 11 year old son has taken an interest in drawing and I needed a pad with LOTS of pages and not too expensive.
4,"Great Jar, One Flaw","This jar is great for bug viewing, the only down side to it is the fact that the magnified lid is held on by slight pressure and not screwed on. While this is not i big deal, transportation can be an issue for later observation. All in all a great jar though."
3,"Decent book on boring,outdated subject","Like many of you looking at this book, I was required to take an assembly language course for my degree. For those of you new to assembly language, it is a horribly frustrating way to write simple programs. This book does a mediocre job at introducing the language, with emphasis on theory rather than implementation. If you're going to actually write assembly language programs, you'll definitely need more help than this book offers."
5,I love this thing..,"I love this thing, when I put it on, no external sound would enter...nice and soft cushions, it is just awesome"
3,Cheap and Useful,"I had high hopes for this product however the headband is a rigid plastic and becomes painful over time, I noticed no quality improvements over say my pair of Apple earbuds and the cushioning around the earpieces is rather rigid and hurts the ears. My only other complaint is that the cable is that awkward length where its not long enough to wrap behind my desk and over but its SO LONG I'm afraid of it getting caught under the wheels on my deskchair. Other than that, useful, if you want quality look elsewhere however"
2,You get what you pay for,"While these worked, I really liked them. The sound quality was nice, and they fit comfortably. However, after only 2 days of use, they broke. I accidently tugged a bit too hard on the cord by walking out of reach - a common mistake. What's not common is that the plug snapped off just from that. I heard a snap, then had trouble getting the headphones out of my port. After I managed to get them out and made sure I hadn't messed up my computer (a much more serious worry), I saw that the plug was crooked and when I pushed to straighten it, it fell off the cord.I've owned several pairs of headphones over the years, and I've stepped on the cord, or walked out of reach several times. But I've never had one break just from that. Flimsy!"
4,a pretty good headphone,"A pretty good headphone,normally, I use my westone 3 for listening to music, I wanna a headphone because it's also works as a ear muff.this headphone is cheap, good-quality.but the feeling of this headphone is strange and easily break, I don't really know"
3,Box says bass boost; too much bass for my taste,"Good headphones, well worth the money IF you want a lot of extra bass boost. The midrange and highs get overpowered. If you want a more linear frequency response, this is not the model for you."
5,awesome customer service,customer service was so lightning fast that I was amazed I didnt get the headphones sadly because of financial issues but regardless I am satisfied and I WILL end up shopping here again
4,Good sound,"These headphones work great (I am not an expert though, just a music lover), not too heavy, and they are comfortable on my ears. They do start to hurt the top of my head after a few hours, however, and would greatly benefit from some padding at the top."
5,Awesome Headphones for low price,"JVC HARX300 Full-Size Headphones (Black)I bought these headphones to use with my laptop. It is fantastic. I've been using them for a few months now, and so far no real complaints. The only one I have is that the cable is very long, but I use a rubber band to shorten the length of the cable. The sound is great, but I'm not an audiophile. I'm very satisfied with this product."
4,TOO HOTT,THESE HEADPHONES SOUND GREAT AND THEY ARE KINDA TO BIG FOR EVERYDAY OUTSIDE USERS..REASON IS THE MAKE ME HOTTER ON A SUNNY DAY ITS ALMOST LIKE EAR MUFFS..THESE ARE MEANT FOR STUDIO USE ONLY I THINK..BUT BESIDES THAT THEY ARE GREAT
2,kid friendly,"these headphones were not what i expected, i should not have been surprised considering that they were cheap, wanted noise canceling, they did not provide me with that, this would be ok for a young person, just to say that they have headphones"
2,Pretty bad.,"Well I ordered these headphones thinking they were going to be nice, decent quality headphones, but it turns out, these pretty much suck. I'll make it simple by making a list.Pros:cheaplong cordsimpleCons:bad sound quality, little bassleaks so much sound its unbelievable. can be heard across a room easily.cheap plasticuncomfortable headbandOverall, I definitely recommend that you do not purchase these."
4,Nice Headphones,"Hello, I thought I would buy these headphones and see how it would function on the airplane. Well I had a chance to use them before I went on the airplane. The headphones are pretty durable, loud, have bass along with a cable that is LONG. I did try them on a LONG airplane ride, and were better than what I expected. So to wrap it all up these headphone are good for the price."
5,Christmas,Got this for both my children for Christmas. It'll hold up better then them cheap little ear piece head phones
3,"Good sound and comfort, but probably won't last","These phones are comfortable and sound fine, but like most others, the cable is very thin and flimsy. Moving these around a lot and working in a home studio, durability is as important as sound and comfort. I predict that the cable will be damaged easily. Sadly, I not would be surprised if this was also the intent of the designers, as planned obsolescence now seems vital to economy."
4,Great Headphones,"Headphones are great for the price, and sound good. Especially to play guitar.Cons: The speakers don't really twist around so you can listen one at a time. Neither vertically or horizontally.Quality in overall is ok, but better to pay little more and have them made better"
3,Ears painning,I don't know how they made this head phone.. my years are burning if i use this headphone for 10 mins.. other than this everything looks ok
4,Good Value for Your Money,"Got these on a whim in place of the Sennheiser HD 201s. They were about 7 dollars cheaper so I didn't expect much and was thus pleasantly surprised at their quality. I've found that highs and mids are crisp and clear but noticed that the bass seems to get muddy (seems to be par for the course with headphones that advertise ""extra bass""). Overall very pleased.Pros-Clear sound-Comfortable fit-Appropriate length cord-Ample volumeCons-Muddy lows-Plasticky construction"
4,Happy,I wasn't sure if i was going to like these headphones because of the price. I thought it would be crappy quality but once i received them and listen to different ranges of music. I'm glad i purchased them. The sound quality is really good. I would recommend them to everyone.
3,not great,"headphones are not very good, but decent for the price you pay though. They cover most people's ears but are not very noise isolating and the bass is not good. They are not too comfortable and the actual speaker is too bulky for what's in it."
4,I like it,I thought the product was just fine and am glad that I purchased it. The sound is clear and the volume is sufficient.
4,Good value,"I wanted an inexpensive headset to try and block out the noise from the crowd in the neighboring cubicle pod, and these do that well. They're comfortable, and the sound is really clear, so I'm happy."
2,awful sound,"this is definately the worst treble sound i have ever head from headphones. the bass is OK, but the overall volume is not the low..."
2,Look cool but the sound is crap,These have very little output they sound 9 db quieter then my cheap radio shack pair. I thought that I would be upgrading however these are really no good.
4,HEADPHONES,"HEADPHONES ARE COMFORTABLE. SOUND QUALITY IS OK, THOUGH COULD BE BETTER. IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT OVERALL FOR THE PRICE."
2,"Comfortable, but poor sound quality.","The ear-cups fit nicely over the ears and these headphones are comfortable, but the sound quality, in my opinion, is poor at all levels--highs, mids and lows. I am no audiophile or anything, but lately I've been looking for some decent and inexpensive headphones. I suppose these are decent for the price, but I think the sound quality is lacking."
1,Sound quality is bad.,Just bought these headphones and I'm pretty disappointed. These headphones seem to be good quality and durable but the audio quality coming out just isn't coming out clean or balanced. I have to turn the volume up way high to actually hear what I'm listening to. The headphones I bought before (JVC HAS700 Portable Full-Size Headphone) worked great and had amazing sound quality. Just stick to the headphones I listed or buy something else. Not worth it.
1,headphones,Cheap. Lousy sound. Spend more money get something better. I would not be surprised if a person could spend less money and get something better. Anyway they are so bad I wil never use them.
2,Poor Sound,"I bought these for a friend who was low on funds. At less than $14 I guess you can't complain a lot cause they do make sound.I am comparing these with the two pair of headphones I own (Sony MDR-V6, paid $55) and (Sennheiser HD280 pro, paid $99). Both these headsets simply blow away these JVC's in every way. The Sennheisers sound the best(64 ohms) the Sonys (32 ohms) sound very good and both are fine with mp3 players.If you take my advice save up enough money till you can afford a good set of headphones and don't waste your money on these cheap and cheap sounding headphones (boomy inaccurate bass and muddy mids and highs)."
2,"Not Worth The Money,only right side worked right",The Left side was barley audable the right side sound was good.would have keeped them if both sides worked.
4,Large Headphones,"Headphones are large, good sounds, very tight on your ears, and cord very long, other then that very good."
3,JVC headphones,"I purchased these about 1 1/2 months ago so I could listen to music and stuff on my laptop while my wife was sleeping or watching tv beside me without being disturbed. These are no frills, basic headphones. They fit really good to your ears since that part of the phones swivel to fit. The band on top is hard and doesn't fit well to the top of my big head but I would rate the comfort very high for the price. They sound a lot better at high volumes than at low volumes....the bass response is too strong at low volumes, but like i said about the fit, for the price it's pretty good. I wouldn't buy again or recommend them just for the high bass at low volume. If all i wanted to do is jam, these would be perfect since the bass levels out at higher levels!"
1,crap product with much better out there for the same price,"I'm no ""audiophile"" but I thought these JVCs would be decent for the price. Wrong! Senheiser HD 202 blow these out of the water for just a tad more $.Pros- good name, cheap, comfy for those with a big head.Cons- really bad sound reproduction with standard mp3s. Very low volume, weak bass, muffled sounding mid range, and none crisp highs. The senheisers I mentioned sound way better than these for about the same price. I'm returning these JVCs and getting another pair of senheisers"
2,Decent for price,"The JVC HARX300 Full-Size Headphones have great quality sound for its price. I got mine 2 years ago for 30 bucks which I thought was a great deal. They lived up to all my expectations, comfort,quality. As for its bass it was mild. I wish it had a stronger more aggressive bass but it didn't, that was a CON for me. Another CON I thought there was, is that it was simply not loud enough. I tried many ways to increase its output but was unable to."
3,"Decent, but not true isolation headphones","while the sound quality is decent, these headphones aren't isolation headphones. They have large earcups, but the foam sealing rings do not block much outside noise. The speaker cups are also externally vented, which allows ambient noise in."
4,JVC Full Size Headphone,"I purchased this headphone a month ago. Overall, it is a good value for your money.The Good:1. Very good build quality (solid) and quite comfort to use. Good looking too.2. Large driver to reproduce plenty of bass.3. Very good ""Noise Cancellation"" effect even it was not designed for, so it is good to use in a noisy office or airplane.4. Very good value for your money. What do you can get for $17.00 (What I paid)?The Not So Good:1. Bass turn to too heavy and boomy when play certain music, need to reduce the bass level from the player.2. Miss some of mid range of sound."
3,"decent enough sound, but uncomfortable head strap","While I'm not exactly thrilled with the sound quality, these are decent enough for the price. I came on here to complain about the head band. It's just a hard piece of plastic that sits heavily against the scalp, poorly distributing the weight of the ear pieces so that after a short time, you can feel an uncomfortable pressure at certain points. A little padding up there wouldn't go amiss. In fact, I've taken to draping a pair of mittens on top of my head before I put these on, which offsets the discomfort, but makes me look pretty ridiculous. Fortunately nobody sees me when I'm using these, but I frown at my reflection whenever I glance at the mirror."
2,Hmmm...well...,"They looked good, they sounded fine. But after a month of use, the tip of the connect broke off--into my iPad! No pulling or tugging, just basic wear. It was a doozy to get that little thing out of the iPad! I can't give it more than 2 stars because it shouldn't have happened with normal wear. I am really sad."
4,Not to bad for price.,"Not to bad for the price. They DO NOT BASS OUT. Good hi range, mid ok. bass is ok nothing to write home about. For the price you can't beat them. The head piece is plastic and it digs into a bald head, needs foam. Head phones have a 6ft cord, that does not kink-up. I bought 2 of this and I think it was a wise buy for the price. gary"
3,so-so quality,"I got these because I needed a cheap replacement for my old headphones. I chose these because the reviews weren't so bad and they looked real comfy. However, after just a few days of use, the right side it broken. I can hear out of the left ear, but not the right. Not sure why this happened, except poor quality. It did work at first, then just stopped.UPDATE: The right side started working again! I'm assuming there is some sort of short, and that the right headphone will work on again off again."
1,worst thing,Bad headset. Mediocre sound horrible bass. Two thumbs down i made a mistake by ordering this. Used once throwing in the trash soon.
3,love jvc,"just rec'd them.....hooked up to home system, good sound. Hooked to ipod not as good.....but overall not to bad for the price......much better than ear buds....but a bit bulkyer...."
4,JVC Headset Great sound,"I am surprised at the sound of this Head set. I bought them to use while playing Online games, on my computer and found that I have to turn down the sound level. Great sound and now I don't have to blow out my ear drums to hear that great sound effects of the games."
4,Very good for the price.,"Don't expect to get Bose quality out of 15 dollar headphones. With that being said, these headphones are great for the price. They sound good, they are comfortable and they have a good build."
4,Great Deal,"They sound normal for the price, has too much bass, but in some song that could be a plus. Excellent for work."
4,Excellent value,"For the money, you can't find a better deal! It's not a $200 pair of phones but that do sound pretty close to phones that cost near $75.We use these for online classes and to listen to our iTunes collection.Recommend!"
5,Very good for the price,"When I bought these, I was a little bit worried about the quality. Instead I got really surprise with the sound and comfort."
4,Great for the price.,"Light-weight fit. Decent sound. With every set of phones I've owned, if they've had an in-line volume switch, the switch performance always degenerated over time and screwed up the sound. These don't have that feature (one reason why I bought them). Only draw back is that I've got a bald head with no natural ""hair padding"", and the ""band"" across the top of the phones is very hard plastic (a little uncomfortable across the top of my head) -- I'll use some cheap padding of some kind to mitigate that. If not for that hard plastic design across the top, it'd get 5 stars."
4,Sound Purchase,"These headphones were purchased for my teenage son. Over the years I have found JVC equipment to be a great value, superior quality, and last for a long time. As soon as he plugged them into the computer to play Lord of the Rings online enthusiastic cheers of joy resounded. ""Dad, these headphones are great, listen to all the sounds"". This made Dad the hero, even greater than Aragon."
5,BUY THEM! Excellent Knock clean sound.,"I brought these when my 100 dollar pair of ""studio quality"" monitor headphones fell apart, and I had my doubts.This item arrived fast and out of the box its a SUPER VALUE, the lows KNOCK HARD and the mid and high ranges are clean. The only little bugger is that the cushions are kinda clunky and hard but I swapped them out for the ones from my expensive junked headphones and now its just a sweet headphone unit. You will love these things, give em a try!"
3,"Better than small headphones, lack sound isolation","These are OK, well worth their low price. They are very lightweight despite their size, which may be good for travel but LOUSY for isolating you from external noise. Any conversations in the room can be heard crystal clear, so if you are purchasing these to get some respite from noise around you, look to a more expensive set. I have theSennheiser HD 202 IIheadphones as well, which aren't as comfortable or lighweight, but do a bit better job at isolating me from surrounding noise for only $10 more than these JVC headphones.Otherwise, these are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. The cord on only 1 side is also nice, as it's just easier to use these without the cord getting too knotted up around your neck."
4,Good,"These headphones sound ok, but there is no noise reduction at all. The headphones are comfortable but they don't swivel or rotate much."
5,love them,"i love this product. i used them to listen to a ,love and the sound was like i was in the movie!! the price is amazing for the sound!!"
5,Nice,Very nice sound. Love the bass and the loudness that these headphones have. Would buy another pair if I need one.
3,Prefer my Sony MDR-V150's,"Bought these to replace my Sony MDR-V150's that my kids wrecked. These were a couple bux cheaper on Amazon, and JVC, so thought I would give them a shot. Listening to my fourth song (of different genres) as I write this review - Bass sounds good, but the highs & mids are lacking, giving an overall muddy sound. Both models are comfortably large (which I need), and both have comfortable ear pieces. The Sony's, however, seem to be a bit more comfy on the top of the head. Overall, these are not bad, but I will definitely be keeping my eye out for another pair of Sony's (then I'll give the JVC's to the kids!)"
4,Good Headphones/Low Price...,"I have a pretty long bike commute and go through two or three sets of headphones. I use monitor style because they stay on better than earbuds and I can offset one side for traffic sound and still hear some speaker. Needed a new pair, cheap yet pleasant. These came super fast using amazon prime. Really nice cans for the price, good sound, comfortable ear pillow, easily adjustable and solid, one-ear cord.Good Bass Boost sound. Hit Treble boost on my ipod controls and voice/midrange make music sound great.Taking away one star for:Headband is wide plastic, i'll be wearing a hat or rigging some fabric for comfort.Cord is too long (my preference)Too much plastic, but should be expected at this price.No doubt a good deal."
3,"Grea Headphones, Until one ear breaks.","They lasted less than one month for me, but those days that they did work were great, amazing bass. I am sad to have them broken."
3,Not too laud,"If you're into listening music in your room in silence this is for you. But if you want to make your ears bleed this is not for you. It fits and feel comfortabe and the sound quality is nice, but is not laud enought to f**** my ears."
1,Silence is not Golden!,I bought a set of these and they worked for a few months and then just went dead. They are uncomfortable and bulky. I would not recomend these..
1,Not As Described,"what can i say ""very disappointed"" its to bassy not enough mids and highs they feel very cheaply made being from JVC i thought great a good brand but uh no sorry but they should stick to car audio and home receivers."
2,no good,With these headphones there is no need to have headphones as I found them to not keep even the little noise out.
4,good buy,I have the headphones for gifts. I haven't given them out yet. So not sure how they work. JVC is a good name.
2,"Possible Knock-off, not as good as expected for JVC","Not as good a product as expected for a JVC headphone. Suspect it is a knock-off as some parts/construction are not typical of JVC but can't prove it. They work but sound is flat and inside the ear cup is flat and hard in a very unusual way that I have never seen before and not like JVC. Have had other JVC headphones but not this one, so can't say for certain that it is a knock-off but would not buy them. Save your money and get the Coby CV185Coby CV185 Folding Deep Bass Stereo Headphones, Blackfor $8 which are far better and less than half the price. If you want a certain color, can get the Coby CV215Coby CV215SVR Deep Bass Stereo Headphones and Earphones (Silver)for $2 more and you get the ear buds but they are crap (I don't know how they can make an excellent headphone and crappy ear buds but alas...) so you are paying $2 more for color choice."
3,way bigger than I thought,"The sound quality is really good - but the headphones are way bigger than I thought they would be. I guess I didn't read (or interpret) the specs properly. So, I'm using them just for air and train travel, since they also block out sound. But for general use.....it doesn't work for me."
4,Great sound but not all that comfortable,"I have a pair of wireless sennheisers I use for my TV. They are really good but I didn't want to spend $120 on a pair of headphones for my iPad so I bought these. I have to admit when watching movies, the sound is fantastic. The only complaint is that the ear pieces are round and a bit small so they don't fit comfortably on the ear and get uncomfortable after about an hour. For $13 though I am not going to complain too much as again, the sound is awesome."
4,Met and exceeded my expectation!,"for the price I paid (less than $10), I was expecting a cheap looking, cheap feeling, cheap sounding head phones and I was wrong again (yup, ""thats what she said!""). These head phones sound just good and looks OK too! Should have bought two for the price!"
4,Quite large,For some reason I thought these would be smaller but they are full size which means not practical for wearing outside listening to an iPod but fine if you are using them to listen while exercising indoors say while using a recumbent bike.
2,Cheap for a reason,"They're really cheap because it's definitely not that great at producing sound. It's like you're listening to one of those old phonographs. It has a nice bass but that doesn't make up for it's lack of quality sound.If sound clarity doesn't really matter to you, then get these!"
5,Great buy,I bought these for my Grand-daughter for xmas..she is 10 and she loved how they fit and did not fall off her head or have ear pods that pop out of her ears. For the quality the price is very good. Shipping is speedy. Would buy these again..happy with my transaction.
4,good for the price,very nice sound!!! and good cuality and confortable nice bass and cable is long and strong recomend 100% ok .
3,"Size = good, sound = bad","I purchased these for my dad who has medium-large-ish ears, and he says that they're the most comfortable headphones he's ever owned. Before giving them to him I tried them on to listen to the sound quality. It is lacking. All of the sound ranges are blurred and jumbled together. My father however is tone-deaf and only uses them to listen to online conferences, and he is fine with how they sound.In short, if you're an audiophile, look elsewhere."
5,wow!,"I bought the headphones for bass practice. I'd plug it in my amp (adapter is included) and it sounded really nice. So I tried on my computer for music, and it was amazing. Consider the price. They couldve sold this for a 100 and it would still sell. If you are looking for more bass in your headphones or are looking for bass amp headphones, this is the way to go. It is a 1/8 jack with 1/4 adapter so it fits most stereos, amps, as well as computers, and mp3s"
4,Good product,I would recommend these headphones they are loud enough and clear enough. The speakers seem to have great life considering that i have been using them for about 6 months and almost always on high. I bought these when after 3 yr. my sennheiser headphones speaker blew out. I was in film school and needed some good replacements for video editing and of course music listening and these not only saved me money but for the money they were a great buy and have lasted me already 6 months i am happy with this purchase and would recommend though not high quality or superb noise canceling which is the reason i gave it four stars for the buck this is probably the best you are going to get.
3,"Decent Sound, Highly Defective","I like to describe myself as an ""audiophile on a budget"". I appreciate the highest quality sounds of music without having to spend a great amount of money. With that being said after reading the reviews and doing various price comparisons on other websites, I made the decision to purchase the JVC HARX300 headphones. Things started off smoothly, the bass wasn't as deep as many reviews led me to believe but it wasn't intolerable, and the sound was desirable for the money I was paying. However, after owning these headphones for about 1.5 months the swivel on the headphones has broke. One can logically conclude that the product was clearly made cheaply. While the sound is optimal for the money you pay, they might not last very long. Proceed with caution."
3,A Decent Pair of Headphones,"Ok, so I bought these about a month ago. They're OK, but nothing special. The size is a bit of a pain, I wasn't able to tell from the photo but they're really honkin' BIG!!! The sound is decent but a little to bass-ey. I guess they're good for dance, hip-hop, and disco, but I listen to a lot of Rock, Blues and Folkier stuff and it's just a little too loud on the bottom-end. Makes it hard to hear the more important aspect of the music. The volume and sound quality themselves are quite good though. If these broke I would look for something similar but smaller, and less bass-heavy, otherwise, I would buy them again."
3,Regulares.,"Compré estos audífonos JVC para escuchar música en la laptop y para jugar videojuegos durante las noches. A la par, compré un Sansa Clip+, el cual venía con unos audífonos discretos pero al parecer de buena calidad. Quedé sorprendido por la calidad de estos últimos, realmente fieles y de sonido potente, mientras que los JVC resultaron ser incómodos y su calidad acústica ni siquiera era aceptable; los bajos suenan bien, pero lo demás no. Yo sugiero que si tienes unos cuántos dólares más, consigas los Sony MDR V150. Tienen una apariencia mucho más agradable y su calidad sin duda, es superior. Al final me quedé con los audífonos del Sansa, y éstos se los regalé a un amigo."
1,bought them today... returning them tomorrow.,"pros:- the earpiece is really big and comfortable. that was the main reason i bought these, the size of the earpiece to be bigger than my actual ear so that my earlobes wouldn't get sore from the pressure of the headphones like they do with smaller ones.cons:- the top part that goes over your head is incredibly uncomfortable. it is very hard and presses down on the top of your head, and as another reviewer put it, after a bit it feels like you are a tribal african lady carrying a bucket on the top of your head- the volume is soooo low. i just plugged it into my pc for pc use, and i am watching just youtube videos, and even with my computer volume cranked as high as i can get it, its still not loud enough, at the HIGHEST POSSIBLE SETTING. i'm about to unplug these garbage headphones and plug my tiny little earbuds in even with the left side earbud not working, just so i can get some decent volume to watch youtube :\"
3,Loud enough for everyone to hear..,Not as loud as I thought they would be for the price. Sound leaked so everyone around you can hear what you're listening to.
4,Great.,"These are the best head phones i've owned, I havent owned many but still for the price they are a great buy. The build is a little cheap, but for 13 bucks what do you except, the sound is a little low. The padding on the ear is very comfortable, but if i wear them to long they start to make my ear sweat. If you are looking for a good pair of cheap headphones get these, but make sure you buy them from Amazon not other vendors, i read lots of problems about these headphones from other vendors."
4,"Very lightweight and pretty comfy, but a bit bass heavy","I wanted a set of headphones to practice my guitar playing, but I can't stand much weight on my head. These fit the bill in that regard and are certainly inexpensive. They are a little bass heavy, but I can adjust my guitar tone to compensate. So if you are gonna use these with an equalizer, you should be fine."
1,Sounds like earbuds,"i bought these thinking that i was going to get a great music listening experience but in reality they sound ""tingy"" the music does not even get that loud, and they should put a volume control on headphones like these. ill shop sony or panasonic, not jvc anymore"
3,Decent set of earphones,I bought this set because I wanted headphones that I could use on a plane or in other places with a lot of background noise. They're decent and I can drown out background noise if I turn them up. The sound quality is decent but it probably won't satisfy the hardcore audiophile. I did find them to be a bit bulkier than I expected. Since I do like to use them while traveling find that they are a bit difficult to fit nicely in a briefcase or travel bag.These are definitely good enough for what I need but if I had the decision to make over again I might consider spending more on a higher quality set of noise canceling headphones.
3,it's a good choice with this price,it's OKit's a good choice with 13.38$Quality of sound 70%Quality of material 80comfortable 60%No mic if you don't know
2,"Good audio quality, poor construction","Out of a few hundred options, I ended up selecting these JVC headphones based on the name and other reviews.The audio quality from them is excellent, although don't expect any audio isolation from them. I still have no problem hearing environmental background noise when listening to music.The headphones themselves broke after a few weeks from stress on the cable connection to the headphone. There appears to be no way to get inside the earcup to inspect/repair the connection without damaging the headphone.Probably a good idea to spend a few extra dollars for a more solidly built headset."
4,ok.........,the sound quality is indeed good for the price but the volume is kinda low if you have an ipod you should be quite glad with these headphones these seem to be more for studio use considering the size they are pretty huge but really comfortable the package says extra bass which is there more so than most headphones i ve used but it is worthwhile if your a stay at home kinda person otherwise get earbuds noise reduction is not mentioned in the description but it is there not the best but really good for price it is extremely worthwhile.
2,Sound is OK but very uncomfortable,I am not audiophile and the sound seems good to me. However the headband is not long enough for my head size and is made of cheap hard plastic. There is absolutely no padding on it. After a while it's quite uncomfortable as you feel you are like African women transport a bucket of water on your head. Also the ears can feel warm after a while.
3,great,GOOD I stress GOOD sound for $13!?!?!?!?! amazing and the more and more i look at them the cooler they look also came with the amp jack NICE!
2,Bad connection,"Not a good product. The 3.5mm metal plug that goes into the audio jack is poorly constructed, such that sometimes not all the sound comes through. I had to continuously readjust it to get the full sound; otherwise i'd get either parts missing, very low sound, or no sound at all. Will definitely look to return this product. Hopefully it's just the one i got and not a widespread design flaw. I know it's not my computer because i've tried other headphones and speakers and they work fine.However, when it IS properly fitted (as in adjusted at juuuuust the right spot) the sound quality is quite good."
3,Meh,"There are good little headphones, I wouldn't suggest them for professional use by any means. They get uncomfortable pretty fast and feel like toys to me. However, they are good for the price."
3,"Better than you expect for the price, far from good.","These headphones are lacking in quality. I believe there is a huge gap in what you get for the price range between $70< and $50>. Grado's would have been a better choice and worth the upgrade but I figured that I would leave these at the office and not worry if they were stolen. If you are looking for a cheap set of headphones that do not need to produce good sound, this is the product for you. A great choice for young teens with volume limiting on the device. You can do better for a little more money if you like to hear your music."
3,Disappointing,"I am an avid JVC fan I own several pair. I was in the market for a pair to use at night to watch TV due to the fact that I work evenings so I am up late and I don't want to upset the neighbors. I was looking mainly for comfort. These are a little on the heavy side and are a bit awkward. I like the single wire design but that's as far as it goes. They are not very loud and have little to no bass response. Please keep in mind that I am a musician so I have a very sensitive ear, however these are very flaccid. They are to say the least ""OK"" for the price but disappointing because they don't come close to comparing to my other JVCs which is a real head scratcher."
3,so n so,The Sound is great and the bass is INSANE but the only problem is that it dont fit my iphone so that suck but i only use it to play call of duty modern warfare 2 on ps3 HDsound all the way son
4,good headphones,These 'phones have much better sound quality then the ones by Sony that i bought them to replace. One drawback is that an average MP3 player can't drive them properly.
3,"Well, It Is Only 12 Bucks...","My review is for people who like loud music with bass....such as rap music. This headphones are ""iight"". They decent. For 12 bucks thats a deal. Have I had better, heck yeah. But they can get loud in such a way but they're no skullcandys or Wesc. And these cans are honestly big as hell for no reason. Looks are okay but like I said, they are big...too big. But if you loud cans that knock.............These ain't for you............I'm mess around and grab another pair......you can only use these for the house. They are that big lol...."
1,"DON""T BUY THESE HEADPHONES","i bought these from amazon when i had a special promotion for free shipping. they did okay for month or so, even though they are really big headphones. but now, only a month and half after they already broke! i have to twist the input side around and press it at certian times just to make it work. now i have to buy new headphones because these ones are just too frustrating"
4,Excellent,"I use it for my pregnancy. Its very flexible and very comfortable. Great price, and quality. Highly recommended."
3,meh,"These are pretty ugly. And their uncomfortable. but they sound great. i dont really feel like writing an in-depth review on this, so i'll leave this as vague as it is to make you think ""is this really worth it?"". i'll tell you right now, they arent. but its a pretty good deal if all you care about is sound"
3,"Good, but........","I've had this camera for several months. Although I'm still learning all it's features, the Sony is far more complicated then I expected it to be. The instruction booklet is confusing, especially when I'm investigating the meaning of an unknown icon that appears in the view screen. Also, the camera body is much bulkier then I anticipated.All those issues aside, it is a good camera that is fun to use, and the 12x zoom is terrific."
2,Hard to use when the shutter button pops off,"I used to like this camera, but just 2 years after I bought it the shutter button popped off. This is not an uncommon problem.[...].So, eventually you're going to end up replacing that button yourself for $18 + workmanship or $180 for Sony to fix it.Now I will be leery of buying another Sony camera. :("
1,"Excellent images, zoom and colors but the worst quality","This was my first digital camera with manual control and features. This camera is excellent with its images and colors, but the shooter device failed twice in one year and I had to pay the transportation and lose many time. I recommend other sony cameras and other brands, right now I use this camera with the fault (Auto Focus fault: is very difficult take pictures but I don't have options) because is imposible to sell in this conditions and I need 100 dollars to repair it again. Is a bad product"
5,Sony DSC-H2 camera,"Very good under a wide range of conditions. Macro to 12x zoom capablity is excellent. Moderate price.Purchased the camera on sale at Christmas and have taken several hundred photos under a range of conditions. Previously used a 3MP Olympus 10x zoom camera.Very good camera for the price. Allows for tweaking exposures and/or full manual control once you figure out the controls and menu system. Was surprised at how close you can get in the macro mode and still use the flash. Flash seems to function well under an extreme range of conditions and distances (for a small internal flash).Control layout, including ""jog wheel"" below shutter button is good. 4-way selector on back of camera (which includes macro and flash functions) a bit awkward to do by feel. The ""bracket"" button on top is nice (tend to do +- exposure brackets) but have accidently put it in the multi-burst postion. Shutter lag isn't very noticable.Could benefit from a brighter/sharper/larger LCD screen, but OK for the price."
4,Great camera finally,I finally got the zoom quality I wanted actually was able to capture 41 of 41 bull riders with clear shots from the second level of the arena
5,Great Camera,"Have had the camera now for about a month, and its been great. Great quality pictures, great features, and very easy to use. The main reason I bought this camera was for faster pictures. My old digital camera took way too much time between pictures and I wanted something faster to capture the moment. This camera gets the job done."
5,Wonderful Camera,"Got everything that I was looking for,in this camera...Taking excellent pics, even at 12X zoom...Taken 100 of pics so far, all are so beautiful, with bright colors and none of then is blurred...flash is excellent..Its a bit bulky than other P&S; cameras, but thats acceptable when you want 12X zoom !!"
5,Awesome for beginners!,I love my Sony Cybershot. It's perfect for the busy mom who wants to get great shots of the kids and family. The camera is easy to use and really light to carry.The only thing I wish it would have come with is a handy camera bag.If you want a solid camera that takes quality pictures without having to spend $700 or more.
1,SHUTTER BUTTON FOCUS ISSUE,Sony DSC H2 camera has shutter button issue. 50% of the time it would not focus but when it focus the picture it takes better picture then canon xt. This camera has carl zeis lense. I would rate the lense 5 star but body not even 0 star( may be negetive). I would not recommand anybody to buy this product.I lost $300 dollar on this camera.
4,Great Camera slow flash,"This is a great camera. The picture quality can be fantastic. The image stabilization works well. The one push white balance feature is very nice to capture great color when using the flash. Battery life is good considering it only has two AA's. The jog dial works well. The flash has great range but isn't too quick. If you are looking to take a few quick pictures in low light just turn it off and play with the exposure. I wouldn't recommend using it in automatic mode, as the pictures tend to come out a little warm or pink. Bottom line if you get to know this camera you shouldn't be disappointed with it."
4,Christmas present,"This camera was purchased as a Christmas present for my wife. She loves it, but it drains the batteries very fast. She uses rechargeable batteries and must change often. If you take many photos, you'll need to keep spare batteries with you. Everything else is excellent."
1,DEFECTIVE DESIGN,Shutter button falls off and has a focus lock problem that should have resulted in a product recall.Sony then charges $120 for a repair.
4,Fabulous Mom camera,"I've had this camera for over a year now. I use it primarily to photograph my two children and document important times in their lives. I can't tell you how many times I've been complemented on the quality of the photos (I especially love the ""sports"" feature that captures quick-action shots like kids running around). My sister in law bought an expensive digital SLR and can't even figure it out because it has so many buttons and gadgets. This is a perfect camera for someone who wants a little more than a point and shoot but doesn't want to get an advanced degree to use it. The zoom is wonderful--great for capturing those mom moments."
5,Excellent camera,"This camera is amazing!!! I've had it for about 4 years now and have had nothing but good luck with it. I use it in various situations with excellent results no matter the situation. The zoom is incredible, it brings far away objects in close and captures them with precision quality. My only regret is that I didn't order the DSC-H7 that came out shortly after this model did. It is 8.1 mega-pixel and has a 15x zoom and was only $50 more at the time."
3,broke after one week,"The camera is excellent, but the shutter button broke after one week of use (at the beginning of a long trip in China...!) and could not hold the focus or use the macro function. It seems that this is a defect of the series. Be aware of it! (I hope that in the meantime they have fixed the problem though)"
1,Buyer Beware,"An otherwise nice piece of equipment is ruined by it's Achilles heel...the shutter button switch. I suspect that everyone with an H series camera has a problem, many may not even know it. I have had it twice. The first time the camera would only take pictures intermittently, but it did take pictures. Sony fixed the bad shutter release assembly. My research indicated that one of the less obvious signs of a problem is that the auto focus does not work when the button is pushed 1/2 way. That is the issue I have now. When I push the button fully it will focus and take a shoot, but I can't set the shot up the way you are supposed to. Sony will fix it for about $180.00. I said no thanks. Of course consider this: many have had the shutter button simply disintegrate. I guess I am one of the lucky ones?"
1,Both are DOA,"I bought two of these for my house and both are DOA, and it's not the bulbs either. Yes, I know how to install them - I have installed numerous ones before and have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. Very, very poor quality control - what are the changes that two out of two are DOA?The unfortunate thing is I didn't get around to installing them for a few months after I received them, so no I can't even return them to Amazon."
2,get what you pay for,i got these because i was looking for affordable security lights. they are very cheap plastic and that is not really a big problem since i was expecting plastic. the lights are very difficult to adjust without breaking them. the amount of time the lights are on and the angle of the sensors are also painful to change.
3,Good Product,"It works fine but if you want to spend a little more money, you should get the 180 degrees model, it will cover a wider area."
3,Finally got it working,"I made a mistake when I mounted this hummer before testing it. I can't get it to work at all and now I either take it down and try to get it working or send it back or just say ""the heck with it"". Geesh.Update: I finally got this working. It works fine when U get close to it."
3,Some good hidden in the fluff,"Agile project management is a subject needing the explanation this book promises. And, indeed, the author does a fair job of providing project managers with templates and guidance for managing projects the agile way.However, the author keeps referring to the ""uncertainty in the agile environment"" as if it were the agile approach that creates uncertainty. This is an unfortunate implication that the author certainly did not intend to make. The agile approach does not create the uncertainty, it was created in order to accept uncertainty that is inherent in many projects. For a wonderful treatment of this concept, be sure to read Chet Richards concise yet groundbreaking,Certain to Win.Overall, this is a fair treatment of a topic needing insights. And it is indeed worth some attention. But a quick skimming rather than a thorough read will likely yield the bulk of what you need from this book. Take the helpful templates and bullet points and skim over the fluff."
5,As Advertised,"Easy installation, direct bolt on. Getting to the alternator on a 2003 Lincoln Aviator is an awful process but once you're there, its easy. After I installed the alternator, I bolted everything back together and started it up. I was getting a steady 14.6 to 14.8 VDC which shows me that it works. It also comes with a 2 year roadside assistance warranty."
5,Capturing this freedom fighter was their biggest mistake!,"He was an idealistic American Gun-runner, captured and imprisoned by the vicious rulers of a battled-ravaged Latin American nation. Then he busted out and the real war began! Robert Ginty, of the Oscar-winning COMING HOME, is demolition expert J.F. Cooper. When his best friend (Cameron Mitchell) is brutally murdered delivering illegal arms to central America freedom fighters, Cooper vows revenge. Trapped and jailed by the ruthless government junta, he stages a spectacular break-out and joins the guerilla's cause. Then, aided by a beautiful young revolutionary (Olivia D'Abo of Conan, The Destroyer), Cooper leads the freedom fighters in a fiery, all-out commando assault on the heavily fortified headquarters of the tyrannical government forces!"
1,Broken Glass,I ordered these glasses 3 times and everytime they came in a million pieces. I would not waste your time purchasing these.
4,Love 'em,Me and my fiance have been looking at glasses to match the blue trimmed dishes that we had bought. these have been in the corner of our eyes for a while now and we finally bought them. the price was the best...not expensive at all...less than a dollar a glass. I love the color of them too-it's such a pretty blue.
2,Nice Looking - Not Very Strong,Decided to give my great glassware set to my college bound sister and upgrade to these fancy looking blue glasses. You can't notice this at first but the glasses are a bit warped and have shape imperfections. Not a biggie for me and it may have just been that I got a bad box or something. But also these glasses break very easily. The previous sets of glasses I owned I had for years and years without incident. These within a matter months began to start breaking - spontaneously seemingly. Currently shopping for another set similar to the one I gave to my sis. It's too bad because I really like the color of these.
3,flea bites,"My then fiance (now husband) and I purchased these when we moved in to our home. My husband dug them cause of the color blue (his fave). We have had these for a year and a half, one did break due to my carelesness, however now I am noticing &amp;quot;flea bites&amp;quot; or little chips at the rim of the glasses. These are probably one of the strongest glasses out there however. Three 1/2 stars due to the rim chipping."
5,These glasses are great!,"I had these on my amazon.com wish list for months and months, and one day when I stopped into Target my boyfriend and I decided to get some new glasses. We looked and played with all of them there, taking them out of the boxes and feeling their thickness and seeing how fragile they were. When we stumbled upon these I thought they looked familiar and we ended up buying them because they were so sturdy (and they match our colbalt blue bowls perfectly). They are so adorable and I love the color, plus they aren't wimpy at all. They seem like they will last a long time, plus it's a tremendous deal at less than a dollar a glass!"
4,Great,My husband uses this all the time. The only complaint I have is that he leaves the lid not quite on.
4,straw dispenser,"very happy with this product. it is made well, it seems as though you could drop it from a coutertop to the floor and no break it. it is also easy to use. i highly recomend this product. i am happy about this purchase."
4,It holds straws,"I once had a box of straws, now they are in a cool plastic holder. If I only have one gripe it is 36 straws...really, not 50 or 40 or even 30...36? Then when I ran out of straws and tried to refill it, I tried to shove 50 straws in (cause that's how they are sold) and they wouldn't all fit. Tada, we have another hot dogs and buns syndrome. Still a pretty good deal."
3,Okay for the price,"There isn't much you can expect for such a simple product. I wanted a straw holder and in that sense it meets my expectation. But because the clear casing is acrylic and not glass, it seems to easily get scratches. It's not a functionality defect but it does change the appearance enough to mention."
1,Not much of a gamble,"Gertrude Atherton loved to give her main character, usually a woman, a secret. Helene Price's secret is that she is a compulsive gambler. Her husband spends the novel trying to figure out what's going on--suspecting blackmail. All of it is pretty hard to take and is rather shallow."
5,"Great, Easy Recipes","I buy cookbooks to read and if compelling, I will make a recipe or two from it. This one is so compelling that I've made four recipes in the first week of owning it. The introductory chapters on health and eating are informational. The recipes are curious enough that I tried one. It was delicious and now I can't stop. The ingredients are easy to find as well."
2,not really ayurvedic,"This book has commercial marketing written all over it. It explains the ayurvedic nutrition system at the beginning, but the recipes (which contain meat & lots of unhealthy foodstuffs) are not in any way tagged as balancing or unbalancing the three doshas, and - although seemingly pleasant to the palate - are full of unhealth ingredients. Not recommended for anyone seeking a healthy way of eating."
2,Too Complicated.,I purchased this book to get healthier but I don't think I can afford all of the spices and condiments that go with eating healthier. I live in a one stoplight town and do not have access to all of the ingredients the cookbook recommends. Maybe a 2 star is a bit rough but be careful if you buy this book if you live in a small town.
3,It Isn't Love That Kills,"It's psychopathic husbands who murder wives who have the nerve to expect them to work! Diane King was a small-town news personality, married to a man who was a former cop and former probation officer. She announced plans to quit her job and stay home with the kids...he proceeded to stalk her with phone calls and letters with words cut out of magazines, which it appears that nobody did any investigation on. Brad was a passive-aggressive bully, Diane was an overbearing and opinionated control freak, and the combination of the two was not good.This book wasn't as well-written or researched as ""Eye of the Beholder"". It doesn't explain things that were said at the trial (how did Diane ""freeze"" Brad's bank account?) It lacks info on Brad or Diane's backgrounds: Diane's turbulent, dysfunctional family; Brad's criminal behavior on his jobs and interviews with former co-workers. However, it is a good companion to that book if you are interested in this crime."
4,Lovingly written,Richard Anderson knows the mind/body/spirit relationship and tells the reader what's needed for a perfect Cleanse and Pruification. Great Book.
2,This take total commiment,"I bought this a very long time ago when a friend was on a wild kick to ""get healthly."" She still does this type of cleanse every year. Here the 2 down falls, you have to buy a totally separate package of all the items needed to do this (none are listed in the book with amounts) and you really have to be 100% totally committed, this is not something, short or easy to add to any every day life. My friend is a stay at home mom and still has unpleasant issues that she knows she has to be at home to deal with during her cleanse. Good Luck"
1,"lots of prosthelytizing, but no instructions for cleansing","If you're looking for instructions for how to cleanse your body, this is not the book for you. The author presents reason after reason for cleansing, but when it comes to providing details on what exactly to do, he says to refer to Book 1 (which is based on erroneous chemistry, so don't bother with that one either)."
5,This review is for my nine-year-old son,"My son can't get enough of this game and has gone on many missions. He was particularly pleased about being able to play as a Pokemon instead of a trainer and he has not complained about the dungeons or design. He has both the red and blue games, but has not stopped playing the DS version to try the other, but I would imagine that they are basically the same game.So, his overall rating is a solid five stars. If he is a representative nine-year-old boy, all young kids should like this game. I don't know about older kids, but he certainly loves it."
4,Should you buy this?,"Red rescue team is a pretty good game, but I myself prefer the classic type pokemon games like pokemon sapphire and leaf green. (As well as the Blue, Gold, etc.) Red rescue team is a different experience where you are the pokemon. It depends on several factors if you should spend your money on this item. Looking at other reviews, younger kids love this game. So it depends what age group you are getting this for. Kids under 11 ""can't put it down"" maybe that's a bad thing... I still gave it 4 stars, but would rather spend my money on the new pokemon game coming out for the DS. Another factor may be which handheld you have. DS~Blue and GBA~Red I only have red so I don't know any plot differences between the two."
3,pokemon game,"this game is very good for pokemon lovers. though the item keep bieng late, so i rated it 3 stars.go pokemon!"
5,ONE great GAME,My Grandson requested this for Christmas hr is going to be 12 and he is a avid player. He will love it
4,My son's review,"It was super fun until after you get Mewtwo. Then, it started to be the same thing over and over again."
4,Red Rox Your Sox,I enjoyed this game and i really liked the test at the beginning although i cheated to get eevee. I think this game would be a great Christmas present.
1,don't buy this,"This is by far the worst pokemon game tha I have ever played. I even bought the walkthrough and I still could not make heads or tails out of this game. The grafics are good but that's about it. The story line could use more work, and the controls could be a little esay're."
1,Sucked,"This game just sucked. There wasn't a regular walk around battle style like in the other games, the battle system didn't work, there wasn't enough story line to make up for it. DONT BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE SORRY."
1,"Good idea, but really bad game","I bought this game with high expectations(it's a Pokemon game, after all). This game is horrible. I thought this game would be a traditional Pokemon game. It isn't. Heck, it isn't even developed by Nintendo, rather by ""Chun Soft"", a Japanese company without an English website. Don't waste your money on this crap."
4,a little difficult for a 6 year old,my son loves pokemon but has trouble with this game he said it's too hard.. he has 14 games so he knows what he is saying..
4,T'is a great game!,"Glad I could get this game even so long after it came out. I had it at one point and sold it for whatever silly reason as a child, but I do so enjoy it, and even today it is a fun, fun game! Glad I got it."
5,My son loves this game,This game was purchased for my 13yr old son. He loves the game and plays it constantly.
2,"Fine for kids, boring for older pokefans","I baight this game expecting it to have the depth of the other games. Those can keep me going for months on end. This one was fine, but once the story was over, I was done with it. I was actually falling asleep trying to go through the 37+ levels in some of these missions. and if you die, you have to start all over again! I'm sorry but I dont even have that attention span. All the levels look the same even though they are randomly generated, they use the same tiles over and over. like I said, one the story was dont, I got rid of it for credit twards one of the newer games like dimond or perl.Currently into Pokemon Ranger. Much better than this one. Highly recoment this one. Great side story.There is a reason they are makeing a movie from the Ranger story and not from the rescue team story..."
4,Pokemon but different.,"It's different from the more commonly known pokemon games. Dungeon plays almost like an SRPG but really just an RPG with annoying limits. The story is interesting if you can follow it, what with all the fighting in this game. All'n'all it's alright."
4,pkmn!,"Reccomended. Period. So far the best pokemon game. I got addicted and was playing 10-12 hours a day! Great for kids of all ages. Adults wont really like it, so buy if you have kids. Laterz!"
2,Son thinks it's boring...,Got this for my son for his b-day as he is a HUGE Pokemon fan. He only played it twice....complained it was boring.
1,CHEAP LOW QUALITY,"When I got married, we received three sets of this silverware. Two years later I wanted to buy another set to guard against losing a spoon here, a knife there. I ordered two sets and the entire set is lighter, thinner, and crappier. Very disappointed as this silverware is awesome."
1,Pure Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,These things are awful. They have sharp edges!!! They chromed rough areas. Theres rust in between the forks. Another fine product made in china!!!
2,Use of dishwasher is not recommended,"Its beautiful. It matches my dishes perfectly. But you can't use the dishwasher. It states, not recommended...I thought I would give it a try. I used one salad fork as my test. It rusted after 2 washes. :("
2,Not the same,I had purchased a set of these from target several years earlier and was kicking myself for not having bought more. I still am. These are similar looking but much lower quality than what I had bought from target. The handles are thinner and are not near as comfortable as my old set. The handles are actually sharp feeling on their ends. Low quality crap for twice what I had paid at target.
5,Smooth!,"I was looking for flatware with smooth handles. I'm disabled, and handles with edges hurt my hands when I grip them tightly. This set is truly my Shangi-La of tableware! Not only are the cylindrical handles round, smooth and really comfortable, the weight helps me control the silverware better than any I've tried, including specialty types.An added pleasure is the smoothness of the bowls and tines. The spoon feels so delightful sliding out of my mouth; it's an unexpected sensual experience.I have had no trouble with them in the dishwasher, and the sleek lines make them really easy to hand-wash, too, as there are no crevices to trap food.I've always bought silverware with an eye to distinctive design. I never knew what I was missing in the way I could wield them; and the design is as pleasing to my eye as to my hand and mouth.I'm giving away all my others, and getting an additional set of the Shangri-La."
5,Classy Flatware at a Great Price!,"I love the Asian influence in this flatware. The pieces have a nice weight to them and are very comfortable in your hand. So far, after one wash cycle (in the dishwasher) these still look great."
3,bend and scratch,the handles on mine are scratched up just from being in the sink with themselves and other dishes. one fork bent just from using it.
1,BAMBOO SILVERWEAR,I had bought this product at Target and the product i bought from amazon looked completly different from the ones i bought at Target. They were ugly and i wish i could send them back for free because they are horrible looking. Dont buy them.
3,Beware!!,"The set is really beautiful but even though it says dishwasher safe, I've found rust spots after only 1 washing."
4,Bamboo 20-pc. Flatware Set,The style and weight is nice. I did notice a few tiny rust spots after washing in dishwasher. The shape of the smaller spoon looks different in the photo than the actual.
1,Hamilton Forge Shangrila flatware,"The look is good,rather heavy in the hand, upon following care instructions, within 3 washings ,handles began to pit and rust. Had to revert to my stainless set which I have had for 35 years without any problem at all, using any detergent available. Would not recommend at all"
1,"Don't buy, wrong image, received different item",WARNING false advertisement!!!!!!!!!!! I purchased this item Bamboo silverware to add to the set I had. Though the image and description were correct i did not receive the same item once shipped. It looked close to the item but was not the same. After contacting the manufacturer they have 2 type. Sold via different stores. Even Target brick and mortar store varies from Target online. When I attempted to return the item to Target they said sorry you need to talk to Amazon. I did not return the item since the shipping I paid plus a return fee would have cost as much as the item. I am very disappointed with Amazon for false images and description and Targets return policy.
4,Great for pirate lovers,"I think the pieces could be thinner, they tend to stick and my 4 year old has bent a couple pieces, but he loves the picture it makes"
4,Great puzzle,"Great puzzle for kids who have mastered 24 piece puzzles. My little girl had been able to quickly figure out the 24 piece puzzles, so when we got this one it was a real challnge for her. Especially since the pieces are smaller. We've had it for a few months now and she still calls it her ""tricky"" puzzle."
5,Great durable puzzle,"We've had this puzzle for a year now with NO issues of splintering, picture scraping off, etc.Both my 3 and 5 year old enjoy playing with it. Love M & D wood puzzles. Good quality!!"
5,Love Melissa & Doug,We love Melissa and Doug puzzles. They are sturdy and last longer than other puzzles. I wish there was a picture for my son to go off of but he seems to be doing OK without it. Love the cute pirate theme!
4,Pieces stuck.,"Great puzzle image, great board to put it on but the pieces were a bit difficult to pull apart and somehow one piece cut my son's hand when trying to get them apart."
1,Melissa and Doug 48 piece pirate puzzle,"I purchased the Melissa and Doug 48 piece wooden pirate ship puzzle for my almost four year old granddaugher. I had previously purchased a number of the 24 piece floor puzzles and felt she was ready for a more difficult puzzle. The puzzle is colorful and interesting, but is very poorly made. When we opened it, the puzzle was not cut very well, so in removing each piece from its neighbor, some of pirate scene separated from the wood, leaving an incomplete scene. This happened twice while we were unlocking the pieces, so we could put the puzzle back together. I asked my granddaughter after we did put the puzzle together if she wanted to do it again and she said it was too hard to take apart and lost interest."
2,Poor quality ruins a great puzzle,"I am a longtime fan of Melissa & Dough puzzles so did not hesitate to order this one for my 4.5-year-old son. He loved it immediately. The only trouble is that the puzzle is so tightly cut that he can't get the pieces apart himself; every time he wants to do the puzzle, I have to take it apart for him. In addition, the wood is so incredibly cheap that the ""nubby"" part of each piece is splitting apart. I have had to glue over 50% of the pieces, and more are coming apart each time he plays with it. This has been a HUGE disappointment because he really loves the puzzle. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come with Melissa & Doug toys and puzzles. Sadly, I would not recommend this puzzle to anyone."
2,Not a good choice for young kids,"I have ordered many other Melissa & Doug wooden puzzles and they have all been great. However, this one was not up to the usual high standards. The pieces were so difficult to separate that a couple of them tore in the process. Very tough to use and we were unable to use the puzzle at all. I would return it but the cost of shipping it back makes it not worth my time."
2,Horrible workmanship,I bought this puzzle for my 4-year old grandson who loves puzzles. I have purchased Melissa and Doug merchandise many times and have always been pleased. This puzzle was horrible. I spent over 2 hours sanding down the tabs as they were so tight the paper peeled off as they were separated. Even with the sanding down the puzzle doesn't meet very high standards and will probably be discarded.
3,fun but bad quality,"My 2 year old boy really likes this puzzle, however, he gets very frustated because the pieces don't come apart easily. He also has to push them hard to put them together. After one use, the pictures started to peel off and the puzzle looks like he's had it for a year. Also it leaves a lot of sawdust like chips. It's messy and bad quality.For that price we could use a nicer puzzle."
5,Excellent puzzle,"When i opened the box and saw this puzzle, i was so impressed with the quality and durability. The colors are vivid. the pieces are not tiny and thin, they are a good size and very thick, can take abuse. My step-grandson loved it. The best part, he can't destroy it, he is very hard on his toys, but this will hold up. I would buy Melissa and Doug products again and i would recommend this product to anyone. Excellent puzzle and great price."
4,Nice puzzle,Bought for my sons 4th birthday. He loves it. Some pieces are sometimes a little hard to pull apart but still a great puzzle. One suggestion would be for them to put the picture of the completed puzzle on a separate paper and not on the back of the puzzle. Some of the younger kids may like to do it by looking at the picture.
2,nice design but medium quality,Wow. I can't believe that there are three pieces that can fit into the wrong spots creating a mystery as to why similar looking pieces aren't fitting properly. I decided to do the puzzle first before giving it to my four year old and discovered that one of the flags in the sky looks right and fits but actually is in the wrong spot. My son did the puzzle and got frustrated and found some other spots that looked almost right and fit. Also I'm finding that some of the pieces are cut too closely so it is hard to remove them or put them on. Nice design but medium quality.
2,"Great concept, poor execution","Let me start by saying I love Melissa and Doug products, especially their puzzles. This one, however, falls short. I understand the concept of having a transitional puzzle between the wooden inset puzzles and a more challenging floor puzzle; the thick pieces should be easier for little hands to manipulate. But we have found, similar to other negative reviews, that the pieces are very difficult to get apart (leading to unnecessary frustration), and that the picture peels off as a result of trying to pry (even gently)the pieces apart. Also, I noticed that there are pieces of wood from the back of the pieces splintering off. We have had this puzzle only two days, by the way. If you have a preschooler who loves puzzles, go with a floor puzzle instead. We adore the 2' x 3' ""Dinosaurs"" puzzle made by Melissa and Doug."
5,My 36 month old loves this puzzle,"We did this puzzle 3-5 times before he was 3. We then started to do it more regularly and with a little guidance from me (how to see patterns in color and shapes and clothes, look a leg-where is the foot/boot? This really helped him be successful very quickly. I did most of the edges and would make it easy for him to 'find' the piece he was looking for. He now can do it almost all on his own and made the transition to the next puzzle (M&D Underwater) very easy."
2,Bad Quality,"I stay in UAE where we do not get much wooden puzzles. So I thought of ordering some online on amazon. Since M&D puzzles were all over the net, I ordered them for my 4 year old daughter. I am so disappointed by the quality of pieces. They are so thick, feel cheap in had, fit so much that it is an effort to break the puzzle again. And to top that, the upper cover/print on the blocks started coming off with one use only. This is when my daughters are so good in keeping their toys. I will never recommend this to anyone. Ravenburger puzzles are such great quality, right thickness, fits well and have not come off after so many uses. Stay away from this one!"
3,Jeopardy,"We've had a lot of fun with this. It's a bit cumbersome to play but well worth it. We are old fashioned board gamers, No TV to that limited us on Jeopardy game choices. Great game though!."
3,Not as easy as you'd think,"I purchased the USR805422 stick because I figured it would be simple to use. USB, just plug it in and no worries, right? Nope. First the US Robotics software over-rides the Windows tools, so you're forced to use it instead. If you get disconnected from your wireless network, it can be a hassle to reconnect. And wait until you need to contact the USR site for support. The product isn't in the support lists yet! I ran into a serious problem where the stick worked for 2 weeks, then suddenly decided it didn't want to connect. The base station name changed from the proper hex values to all zeros and the channel kept switching. The only way to fix it was to reboot. I would not recommend this to anyone (unless they made me mad)."
2,Correct info about Pierre vanderLinden,"Pierre vanderLinden was never forced out of Focus. He quit Focus because he was sick of touring and putting up with the the Thijs vanLeer/Jan Akkerman soap opera. His departure wrecked the band. If you don't believe me, give Hamburger Concerto a spin. If there are any ""technical limitations"" to his drumming, I'd like to know what they are. He did not leave the music business after the Trace album. He switched from pop and rock to jazz a'la Bill Bruford."
5,Great CD to listen and dance to,These guys are great! Their performance is excellent. Lucius really puts his soul into his music. You all must see them live. You'll enjoy the CD even more.
5,Love these brushes,I have used Denman brushes for many years and really love them. I ordered 2 this time so I could have one in my travel bag.
4,The Good Brush,I bought this brush to help detangle my hair. The brush works well an I hope it will last me years. I would definitely recommend this brush.
1,boring,"This book flat out sucks. I took a corrosion class at my university, and when I tried cracking it open to study for a test, it was nigh unreadable. Also, pages with important charts started falling out..."
4,Good balance of price and quality,"I'm no chef, but I've used a lot of pans and I'm pretty happy with this one. I did a lot of research (probably too much) and went with this one, but there were a lot of other options that looked decent as well. It's showing some scratches now after about 6 months of use (slash abuse by my roommates), but there's no such thing as an invincible non-stick pan so that's what you get. Just buy a new non-stick every 2 years or so, unless you have abusive roommates...then probably every year."
2,Too light,"I returned this pan because it is very light-weight. There was also a minor defect in the way the non-stick coating was laid down on the particular pan that I received, creating a raised line in the bottom of the pan, which sealed my decision not to keep it."
4,decent cookware,"delivered promptly as advertised, durable finish however is somewhat lightweight and plastic handle probably isn't oven safe."
4,Bollobas,"This is a very well structured book. However, this book is not amenable to easy reading. The theorem proofs are short and concise with no overt explanations. Bottom line is that reading this book is a an exercise for the brain.Being an engineer my only grouse about this book is that this book is written for mathematicians and as the author himself claims there are very few practical applications accompanying the theory. But this being a graduate text in mathematics it really cannot be expected to fulfill this need."
2,A very mediocre translation...,"Richard Osberg's translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight comes with a short introduction, a decent glossary, and a few intresting notes, but the translation itself is very average, and the ... price tag makes this the most expensive translation currently on the market. There are several superior translations of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight that can be obtained at a tiny fraction of the cost of this one. I would especially recommend J.R.R. Tolkien's Ballantine paperback edition, Brian Stone's Penguin edition, or James Winny's prose translation, published by Broadview Literary Texts."
5,wonderful read,"This book is a wonderful read, detailing various theories of teh origins of the moon. More interesting to me was the history of these theories. Very few science books spend time talking about how ideas evolved, and in particular how ideas as recent as 30 years ago have changed. This book was fun and easy to read, and Dr. Mackenzie does a great job explaining the science and conveying the excitement he clearly feels for the topic!"
4,Good review of the history of planetology,"From Aristotle to Darwin (George not his father Charles) to Neil Armstrong, an interesting recount of what folks thought about the moon and what we know now. I liked Dana's style covering what could be a dry subject in an entertaining manner for young adults and adults alike."
1,Too late to be selling 2005 calendars,"I bought this calendar as a christmas gift for a friend who used to live in the Lowcountry but moved to Hawaii, but it is for 2005, not 2006! I am now kicking myself for not looking a lot closer at the year of the calendar. I looked at so many calendars to find the one with the best theme and pictures and didn't concentrate on the year. I assumed that calendars advertised late in November would be for the following year, not the one almost completed, espcially at that price. I have learned to be overly cautious about the sellers and slow to trust the products advertised."
4,Back to Life,"This book is really good and near the end I could understand why it was titled ""Back to Life"". It's a great love story of the two main characters meeting through friends. Skeptical that the relationship may not work out due to cultural differances they make it work even though it wasn't gonna be an smooth ride for Lisa and Marc. And in the midst of a lot of racial tension going on at that time, they had a lot going against them. I hope to read future novels from Wendy Oakley-Thompson."
5,A must read,"Back to life is an excellent read! Thompson-Coakley keeps the reader engaged with real to life characters. The description of the climate/setting are so real, the reader feels as if they are there. The themes of race relations and love relationships are not only timely but help to enhance the story with twists and turns that keep the reader glued to the book. Thompson-Coakley's book has the making for one of OPRAH's book club readings. I couldn't put the book down. My only question is ""when is she coming out with another book?"""
1,A Complete Dud,"In this nevel you have the classic angry female who makes you wonder why any man would want to spend time with her. Since I live in NY and was old enough to know that there was racial tension after the death of Yusef Hawkins I could possibly understand that a relationship between a black woman and a white man would face some scrutiny, but for the main character Lisa to somehow hold Marc responsible for all the ills of every man of Italian descent everywhere is a bit much. The critical ingredient in a romance novel is romance and this novel lacked the main ingredient. By the end of the novel I could not care less whether Lisa and Marc got together."
2,Nothing but pages of Mundane Profanity,"Coakley-Thompson's ""Back to Life"" is truly one of the worst IR romance novels ever published. Do not waste your time and money on these depressing pages. Only pages 239 to 243 showed some mercy to the reader. The staggaring amount of mundane profanity made this a nightmare to read."
3,"OK, but really typical","Nothing to write home about. I would say more, but the book wasn't really good. I recommend The Color of Love by Sandra Kitt."
2,Hank deserved better,"Perhaps I set my expectations too high for Crazy.Hank Garland was one of the most gifted guitarists ever. It seemed as if all the recording stars from Patsy Cline to Elvis wanted Hank in the recording studio.The film's music is excellent. However, the emphasis on Garland's turbulent personal life significantly diminished his celebrated musical achievements.The film's unceasing profanity and vulgarity made it even less watchable and earned it its R rating.Waylon Payne was fine as the mercurial Hank Garland. Too bad he didn't have a good script to work with."
2,Stretches itself too thin,"This book tries to do too much, many details are left out and the reader is left with only a cursory understanding of the material. Its better to buy separate, dedicated books on computer architecture, assembly language, compilers, and operating systems, in my view. Digital design and Computer Architecture by Harris is probably a better choice."
5,Movie is a must for Doctor Strange lovers-look at it,"I am a Strange collector. I viewed this movie on T.V., and had to have it. The movie is a 70's movie, and the dress appears to be a little hokie, but the 'gist' goes deep and Doctor does battle with evil, and chooses his destiny wisely. To me, the movie does Doctor Strange very well."
2,"Oh my, not DrStrange at all","Ok, I bought it but it is only for my DrStrange Museum I am collecting anything that has his name on but BOY if you're not a DrStrangeaholic run from this tape; it is not what you'd expect."
1,liars,"I bought this product BECAUSE IT PLAINLY STATED ""Leather Bound"" covering. It has that cheap plastic cover. Very dissapointed. The same bible, with the cheap plastic cover (leatherflex),can be purchased for twenty dollars other places online.Other things mentioned; 2 colum; center ref; Giant print; Words of Christ, are correct. Paper is acceptablle, but cheap.I would not pay this much for this bible again."
4,Great album...,"I found this band on MySpace and I loved their music. I immediately e-mailed them and asked them to play my big concert in August. They are super cool fellas.As for the album, my favorite songs are ""All Info"", ""Disagree"", and ""Stare At One Thing"". They rock a bit and if you liked/miss the Seattle sound then this band is for you. They have a good quality and innosence to them, yet they know when to rock. Great music plus great people equals four stars from me!"
