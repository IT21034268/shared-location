2,Junk! Plain and Simple,"Junk! It will dull or totally ruin any large blade that you run it across. For thinner blades, such as most kitchen knives, it works reasonably well. Terrible for thicker blades, such as hatchets, axes, machetes, as it will dull them to the point that the only way you will be able to reacquire an edge is to use a fine file or grinder with a relatively smoothe/fine wheel.Save your money! Invest in a set of quality whetstones that may take longer to get the desired results, yet don't destroy your blades' edges. As for me, this thing is going in the trash!"
5,"Simple & VERY effective, safe sharpener.",This is one of the best knife sharpeners we've ever owned. Bought this one for our son-in-law. Nice size and very effective.
5,AccuSharp knife sharpener,This is absolutely the easiest and best knife sharpener I've ever used. I love it! And that's why I bought another one as a gift.
5,KISS,"The KISS principal.. Keep it simple stupid! this sharpener is so simple to use that a 3 year old could do it.. not that I'd reccomended it because of the razer sharp results. It makes knives scary sharp, which is how they should be."
5,Excellent,"I use it to sharpen machete, knives,pruners,and lopers. It is easy to use and does the job. For the money, it is a good buy."
4,Made it so sharp I almost cut my finger off,I was so used to not really having worry about my knife being sharp enough so I was a little careless the first time I was chopping onions with my newly sharpened Victorinox. I seriously cut myself with my awesomely sharp knife thanks to the Accusharp. It didn't need stitches but man did it hurt.Accusharp for the win!
4,Works fine if you use it right,If you use this right ..it will sharpen your knives perfectly...you have to use the right pressure and the right angle...but you will get used to how it works best after you use it a time or two...I have an expensive knife set in butcher block ..but thought I was going to have to buy another set ...after years of use ..they have dulled ..but this brought them right back to life and they are as sharp now as they were when I first bought them..
4,Works great....,"This is a very east to use sharpener, just don't press down too hard as too much material will come off your knife and leave gouges."
5,Best $10 I Ever Spent,"I saw this product on America's Test Kitchen on PBS. Of course the $100+ knife sharpener they tested was rated the best, but the show did give mention to this knife sharpener. WOW! It really works. It has given new life to some old cheap knives I was using. I'm thinking about ordering several more and using them as Christmas stocking stuffers."
5,Excellent knife sharpener,I received this item as a Christmas 2011 gift. I can sharpen my cooking knives easily and safely in a very short amount of time.
4,great sharpener,"This is a very inexpensive, geat knife sharpener. I highly recommend it. I have tried others and this is the best so far."
5,Amazing sharpener,"Before I bought this sharpener, I was considering getting new knives. I received this sharpener last week and spent about 15 minutes sharpening 10 knives. They are all razor sharp now. I'm so glad I decided to try this before getting new knives."
4,Simple and works,"Just used it to sharpen all of my knives.works well, easy to use. just be careful not to cut your self.I would recommend this item."
4,AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener,I purchased this based on a recommendation over at [...] - it does seem to be a good sharpener and I will continue to use it.
5,My old camping knife is sharp again,"I just received this sharpener and I sharpened 3 different knives with it. Two not so dull kitchen knives I have kept sharp with ceramic rods and an old Coleman camping knife that I haven't sharpened for years.The two kitchen knives, Paula Dean btw, got a little sharper then they were but again they were already sharp, but the Coleman camping knife was very dull and now I can shave with it.This really worked well and it only took 4 swipes to make a very dull knife extremely sharp again. No idea how long it will hold up or if it will do harder steel knives or not.Get this it works. 4 day delivery from the time I ordered it on the slow boat free shipping offer.Very good product, very good seller!"
3,Mixed Results,"I bought this due to positive reviews, price, and small size.So far, I've used it (following package directions carefully) on a small paring knife and a large chef's knife. The paring knife seems a little sharper than before, but the results on larger knife were pretty bad. There are now small nicks in the blade that weren't there before, and I assume they are the reason the blade cuts worse than before.Maybe it's just harder to keep the sharpener balanced correctly while running it down the longer blade? I'll probably just use this on the smaller paring knives from now on, but even for limited use, the price constitutes something of a bargain, IMO, and it's US-made to boot."
2,"Works well, but does not last...","I ordered this item at the same time that I ordered a J.A. Henckels 8 Piece Stylus Block Set. When I first received this sharpener, It worked well at keeping the knives very sharp. After using it for around four months, honing the knife blades about once a month, I needed to open it up and reverse the carbide inserts because it had stopped sharpening the knives.Within another four months the sharpener was completely useless. It wouldn't work any longer. So the carbide inserts do need replacement after 30 to 40 times of use, and the carbide inserts that need be replaced are at a cost almost equal to what I had paid for the entire unit the year before.The ""5 to 10 years of use between blade changes"" on the product page is a complete exaggeration. I, just two weeks ago, paid over $7.00 to Amazon (best price on the web) for a new set of replaceable blades, after 8 months of light use."
2,Disappointed After Reading the Cook's Illustrated Review,"I bought this product after reading the Nov 2006 Cook's illustrated Review of manual sharpeners. I was looking for an affordable option to sharpen very dull knives, as electric sharpeners are not in the budget right now. Perhaps it is because my knives were very dull, but the sharpener did not return my knives to the desirable sharpened state, even after about 5 minutes of passing the sharpener over the knife. In fact, the sharpener left grooves in my blade! Now I will have to buy an electric sharpener or find someone who can professionally grind my knives into the proper sharpness. That being said, the knives are a little sharper than when they started, but I have returned the device and asked for my money back."
2,Very dissappointed with this sharpener,"I too bought this knife sharpener because of the great reviews here on Amazon. I ordered this in July and waited till I had used it a lot before I gave it a review. My knives do not stay sharp for very long. I find myself having to use it again before the job is done. I can use a sharpening stone but thought this would be easier, and it is. Just wish it worked as well as I thought it should, given it's great reviews. At least it didn't cost much."
4,Nice blade.,"So nice! We sharpened all our knives in one go. I mean, it's definitely not for a professional cook, but for a broke college student... good deal."
4,Good,"Didn't make the blade super sharp, but good enough to cut my veggies .. Its easy to use and does the job."
4,Really works!!!,"I was skeptical... now I am an advocate.Several sources recommended a different –and much more expensive– sharpener. I decided that, at the price point for this device, it was worth a try.I have a forty year old chef's knife which I kept for sentimental reasons but which was useless. It wouldn't take or keep an edge. It was the first knife I sharpened and the results were amazing! It has been returned to 'favorite utensil' status. It is extremely sharp!This sharpener is well worth the money. I down-rated it one star due to needing to reverse the carbide sharpening stones after extended use... which I haven't had to do as yet. There are 'replacement' carbides but, hey, they cost a few dollars less than the complete sharpener so what's the point?"
1,Doesn't sharpen at all.,"This sharpener really didn't leave my knives sharp. It took off metal from the blade and they seem even duller now. I wouldn't recommend this product. Maybe if you knives are pretty sharp to begin with, it might work as an upkeep tool."
1,All my knives are dull now,"Either I got a bum product or this product is the worst thing ever. I think it works on those terrible Ronco knives, but it completely ruined my s30v steel and even my Spyderco Tenacious is all micro serrated now and 8cr13mov is supposed to be an easy steel to sharpen. Completely disappointed in accusharp after all their good ratings. I feel like I would have to reprofile all my knives now because of this thing. It just rips off steel."
5,"buy it, love it, gift it...","Heard about this product on a TV program just about the time a houseguest was mentioning how dull our knives were. Kismet - ordered one and it arrived before houseguests departed. Sharpened all the knives in about 15 minutes. I never realized how bad our knives where! So easy and safe to use in addition to performing splendidly. I am ordering plenty more for gift giving. No need to ever, ever, ever have a dull knife again. Great price too!"
5,so easy to use,I love this sharpener. It's small enough that you can keep it in a drawer and it's easy enough to use that you can use it every day. And the price is right too.
4,Sharpie Tool,small and efficient...Nice gift idea for all households. college bound student.Newly Weds. Boy Scouts troops should keep a few handy for the campouts. Cost is reasonable too
5,It really works!,The little gadget really works well. It's a great deal for the price. I have some knives that never cut well until I used the sarpener. I used it once and expect it to work even better after more use.
3,Jay,I have used the sharpener about 10 times in the past month or so. Does a good job of putting a new edge on the knife's blade. Easy to use. For the $8 dollars it's better than paying $80 for a electric sharpener.
3,sometimes it works...,"On some knives it works beautifully and gets them almost as sharp as using a stone, on others it ruins the blade...Sharpened a cheapo buck knife nicely but ruined a $300 balisong... go figure..."
5,Solid sharpener.,"I received this sharpener two days ago. What can I say? Solid, simple design. I had a sharpener the same design called ""Shark"". I love this product. People spending hundreds of dollars for electric sharpeners, but you need only one basic one-AccuSharp. It does the perfect job, fast, easy to use, easy to store, super light. I would recommend this product if you looking for simple basic sharpener."
2,Not a good sharpener!,"After reading all the 5 star reviews, I bought one for $10.00. I've tried it on a couple knives and after running over the blades numerous times, I wasn't impressed at all. Considering the price, I guess the old saying is true, ""You get what you pay for""."
3,I must be an idiot,"I must be an idiot. I can't sharpen knives no matter what type of apparatus I use. I have a Chef's electric sharpener and can't get an edge. I have other hand sharpeners and they don't work for me. I'd like to say that the AccuSharp 001 knife sharpener turned the tide. Well, no it didn't."
5,VERY SHARP,I GOT MY ACCUSHARP ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO. IT'S MADE IN AMERICA. I DON'T KNOW BUT I'LL BET THE NEW ONES ARE CHINESE. IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOURS THAT'S THE REASON WHY.I USE MINE TO DE-BURR SHEET METAL AND SHARPEN MY WOLFGARTEN HOES. I GARDEN 4800 SQUARE FEET AND THE ACCUSHARP GETS A LOT OF USE!MINE WAS A GOOD ONE. HOPE YOURS IS TOO...
1,Blunt force trauma,Is what knives 'sharpened' by this 'sharpener' inflicted on my fruit and veg. Back to the stone and steel for me.
5,Dull lifeless knives now almost good as new,"This sharpener is awesome for the 9 dollar and change price. knives that were dull from years of use were once again sharp and slicing away. it even worked on the serrated knives. quite simple to use. a few strokes with gentle pressure at a 90 degree angle is all it takes. for something that will be used maybe a few times a year, it's an awesome price."
5,Foolproof...,"When it comes to having a knife sharpener, I have 2 things counting against me: I am not the most coordinated person in the world and I do not have a lot of storage space. This gadget is foolproof, small, and it works! In terms of longevity, it is still new so I can't rate it on that. But so far it is awesome and if it only lasts a couple years, it was very inexpensive so I would not be too disappointed."
5,I can sharpen now!,"After years of ""trying"" to sharpen knives with no real success, I can now finally and confidently obtain a razors edge in seconds with very little effort! Woo-hoo! And I don't mean razor figuratively, I mean razor as in able to shave hair off my arm. I've got a few small bald patches to prove it =)Gentle pressure yielding to barely any pressure and a little stropping on the palm of you hand will give you a razors edge. You can feel the blades bite for the first couple of stroke, you can even feel where the edge is worn more than other spots. Then it's like it's gliding on glass and you're done. A little tip is to follow the angle of the knife, keeping the AccuSharp perpendicular at all times.I love this product!!!"
3,Don't be cheap and lazy!,"I was so excited when I discovered this knife sharpeners...I thought it was going to revolutionize my cooking culture. However, I was quickly disappointed. I have owned this for 6 months now. While it only does an okay job of sharpening, it removes quite a bit of the metal on the knife, which can be really detrimental over time. It's really quite mediocre. Unless you are far away from a professional knife sharpening service, I say stop being cheap and lazy and take your good knives there."
1,Pass on this ...,"I recommend passing on this sharpner. Perhaps the item I received is defective, but it does not work well. With each pass, I could see it was taking a toll on the blade. I have no doubt if I continued it would eventually ruin the knife. It did not make the knife any sharper."
1,not sharp,"I purchased this knife about 6 months ago, & i can tell you even with all the great reviews it got, that it is junk. It dosent sharpen very well leaves a dull finish no matter how many times i run the blade thru it a few or a hundred the same results DULL, will not cut paper & tears cardboard. I do not recomend the 'sharpener' to anyone.I think its more of a utility sharpener such as lawnmower blades & machetes, but it is no knife sharpener PERIOD find a better product"
4,Good quality for good price,For the money the accusharp provides a quality product. It is durable and lasts awhile for a reasonable price . Provides a nice sharp edge . I used it on some of my most beat up and dull edges and it did a good job restoring a cutting edge. Hope this helps someone!
5,Accu Sharp,This is the best knife sharpener I have ever used. It is very easy to use. Great gift for men.
5,It actually works well,I have tried several types of knife sharpeners and they all gave a blunt edge at best. This little guy has turned all my cheap and old knives into functional tools again. This thing actually takes slivers of metal off with each pass and gets you a nice sharp knife with just a couple passes. I probably would not use this on high end knives as it removes enough metal to notice but it works great if you don't mind.
5,"Simple, but works great",I was surprised by how well this knife sharpener worked. It even works on cheap knives and takes only a few seconds.
5,sharp product,This is fast and easy to use. Two strokes and I have a very sharp knife. I need to get a bunch more (as gifts for people I know who love to cook).
5,"""A HANDS DOWN WINNER""",Bought this product without even looking at reviews. It was just so cheap I thought I could take the chance. Am I glad I did!!! Saves a lot on expensive sharpeners and the headache of figuring out how to use them without 'actually reversing the sharp edge' and all that jazz. This thing is easy to use and it work well. Even if it doesn't work forever it's so cheap I can buy it again and again if needed. I don't expect to live forever anyway so a sharpener that doesn't work 'till kingdom come' is not really a big deal. Great buy!!!
4,sharp sharpener,"I saw this product on Americas Test Kitchen and it was given a good review from the host. I ordered it while the program was still on. I couldn't believe how easy it was to use and how sharp my once dull knives became. What a difference it is when your knives are as sharp as they should be! I'm sorry I didn't know about this amazing, inexpensive product earlier!!!!"
3,"it is ok, not really appropriate for quality knives","This is a good tool to use on a inexpensive knife or other piece of equipment. If you have a nice set of knives, you should not use this. Different kinds of knives, and knives with different blade thicknesses, have different angles that should be used when sharpening. If you want to learn more about it, you can search professionally sharpened knives and look for the onemansblog link. That being said, I bought 2 of these, one for garden tools and some of my cheaper knives, and 1 for a rental property that I own where renters periodically put knives in the dishwasher. After you use this tool, the blade will be nice and sharp. It's a great value, it just shouldn't be used with premium knives."
4,seems to work -- if you use it right,"Because I am lousy at following diagrams, at first I was using this backwards -- and it nicked up my knives. Knowing this about myself, I started with the knives I cared least about. So by the time I understood the diagram (which really is very simple, in reality) I thought it worked very well on my expensive knives. I recommend this."
3,It's ok.,"It gets your knives sharp with little effort, but not super sharp.There is a review on here from a person who takes knife sharpening seriously. This individual talks about how to get knives razor sharp and indicates that this device does *not* get knives razor sharp. This person is correct.It doesn't get your knives razor sharp. The sharpness doesn't even approach razor sharpness.But it is a helpful tool, especially if you don't know how to or don't want to get your knives sharp using a whetstone or similar method.I use it. I am glad I own it. But I really wish it would get my knives sharper than it does.For the cost, it's a value. But does it make your knives anything near razor sharp? No. It doesn't."
5,Superb and very easy to use,"The reviews you find at other websites by professional chefs sold me--all raves. They were right. Don't spend more, this is really easy to use and my knives are razor sharp. A 10 second touch up every couple of days will keep a knife in great shape."
4,Really Good!,"The Ace Combat Franchise origanally steered clear of the Xbox game system. This was the first game that can be played on the Xbox 360. Overall, this is a really coll and fun game. The graphics are nice, and the storyline is interesting. But with that said, the levels can get long and hard to beat, and can easily make someone frustrated. Overall, a good game, and according to many people, better than the sequel, Ace Combat Assualt Horizon."
3,Ace Combat 6 - fun,The game has a lot of fun graphics and is fun to play. It is a simple flight system - so not too sophisticated.Good for a game console - would not be acceptable on a PC.
2,Please stop talking,"Ok, I've never been much into flight simulator games and I'm only halfway done with AC6 but I just had write this review because of how terrible the story mode is for this game.The planes are fun and look good, the missions are fine and I have no problems with the overall game play... But the story and voice acting in the cut scenes are so bad that I can't stand it.It's like the script was written by an adolescent monkey on a braille typewriter. The dialog is horrible from the first word that's spoken and is delivered by characters who have nothing to do with the actual game.It would be nice if the story actually followed the character that I'm supposed to be playing, but instead it follows some lady looking for her kid, some Russian guy with a limp and basically anyone else who doesn't fly a fighter plane and isn't the main character.Ahhh! It's just bad and every time someone talks in this game I just want to eject from my cockpit and let the bad guys win."
1,Too Difficult,"I found certian missions unrealistically difficult. Mission 9 is crazy. So, unless, you enjoy frusteration to the third power don't waste your money!"
3,"Prettier graphics, better sound, same basic game.","I would've given this game a four if it weren't for the fact that this game just isn't that fresh when compared to it's predecessors. It sticks to the same formula. Similar missions, a fantasy gigantic aircraft, among other things, are nothing a veteran Ace Combat player hasn't seen before. The story component of the campaign is slightly interesting, but it can feel more like a side story getting in the way of game play as supposed to being a tale that is truly involving, revolting, mesmerizing, etc. If you are new to Ace Combat, and if you're missing a fun flight ""sim"" game, then this will be fun, since in my opinion it is by far the most refined console flight sim game out there. If you're a veteran of the series, then go for it. You won't see anything new, but it's still a fun game to play to release that Ace urge within!"
3,"Fun, but not the best","The game is fun, but definatly not the best in the Ace Combat series. If you've played the other games, you'll know what I'm talking about. Its mostly more of the same, stupid plot, dumb videos in between levels, and yes, the last level you fly through a tunnle. The game doesn't even take place on Earth, some other stupid planet. If you want a good ace combat game get Ace Combat 5 the Unsung War, or Ace Combat 0. If you like flying games, this is a good one, but its not the best."
2,CHILDITH,"Bought this as a gift for my Nephew.As a seasoned player, it is so so with him.Cannot recommend for a ""serious"" player of video games.John"
5,Graphics and gameplay are amazing !,"Played this games demo recently and finally decided to purchase the actual game. It was made around 07 if I am correct and I got to say the Graphics and smooth gameplay on this title exceed my expectations. It plays great and there's a ton of downloadable content to purchase or simply just download it for free on some items. It has a good amount of fighter planes to choose from and a pretty simple storyline, but when it comes to the actual dog fighting and flying the skies this game is Great. If you like flying games and haven't tried this one out, you should totally get it!"
4,Great game!,"I have always loved flying games everything from Microsoft flight simulator to the ace combat series. It's better in ways compared to assult horizon which is the latest installment of the series. It does have a few flaws. Like the fact that on the XBox 360 version you half to select your hard drive every time you load a game even if your profile is already logged in. kinda anooying. And there is allot of stuff you need to select when in the menus. The flying is anazing! Better than ace combat assult horizon. You are limited to an altatude of 39,000 feet but I'm pretty sure that some jets in the game can fly higher. The controlls are limitless, barel rols high G turns etc. Great game would recomend it to any flying game fan."
2,unsung war was better.,"After AC4, the AC series took a serious nosedive, this game is a perfect example of the ongoing low quality of the newer titles. The story lines have gotten insane and the characters -- especially their dialogue -- seem like they've been created for Three-year-olds. But we don't play games like this for the story, we're looking for realistic action, and this game misses that target big time. Instead of stressing actual battle characteristics, the developers have created impossible situations (really, flying aircraft carriers?) that simply does not engage the player. The graphics are fine but the incredibly frustrating missions just make this game not worth playing,So, unless you enjoy frustration to the third power don't waste your money."
4,Great Game!,"I love this one, just have yet to try it with the USB Flight Stick from Amazon, bet I would send my rating from 4/5 to 5/5!"
5,Good Flying !,"I find the game exciting and very simple to use and play. Got to get better at shooting missles, but I think in time I will be able to play more efficiently."
4,"It's the same as previous games, just different missions",I like the game. It's the same as the previous games with the exception of different missions and fewer planes. I have a couple of them for my old PS2 so I bought this one for the 360 and I've enjoyed it.
3,Clever historical mystery,"A TWIST AT THE END blends history and fiction together, using ""O. Henry"" as a character during a series of murders in Austin, TX. Saylor excels as a writer in bringing places to life (though I haven't gotten in to his Rome books), and historical figures pepper the story. His crisp, descriptive prose makes something completely ridiculous - like a hailstorm that chills a river in seconds - seem like a believable occurrence. The opening is a clever twist, in true O. Henry fashion, and a sense of solemn sadness (if you know anything about O. Henry's life) pervades the events. This fits the grim murder mystery tenor of the main plot. I won't spoil the whodunit, but as other readers have commented, the answer is disappointingly simple and the longer the characters couldn't figure out the ""unsolvable"" murders, the more unbelievable it became. Hopefully Saylor will continue to mine Texan history for other real-life mysteries he can resurrect and reimagine for modern readers."
3,Kind of Dull,"I like Steven Saylor's Gordianus novels and have given some of them five-star reviews. So when this book came out, I was very interested in it. But, unfortunately, I found it kind of dull. The main character, William Sydney Porter (O. Henry), is not an investigating detective. That is, he IS a detective in this novel, but he does little or no investigating. And after his love interest is murdered, he still does little or no investigating. I thought the Austin setting was interesting: Saylor excels at bringing the details of the past to life. But the story line was rather flat."
2,Melodramatic Twaddle,"Being a big fan of Steven Saylor, I purchased ""A Twist at the End"" after having already read all of Mr. Saylor's ""Sub Rosa"" stories and other ancient Roman mysteries with relish. Approching this novel with an open mind, the book started with a lot of promise. I was expecting a good mystery but instead the story got bogged down with a lot of melodramatic twaddle that sadly misses the mark. The storylines are too spread apart to form a cohesive novel. I found myself skipping whole pages of prose that to me were excessive and unnecesary. It got to the point that reading ""A Twist At the End"" was too labor intensive."
3,Not interesting enough to actually dislike,"This book was boring. It wasn't actually offensively boring, it just went on too long, was too dull, and could have been chopped quite effectively. It dragged. There was extraneous detail that makes one think of a teacher's pet, showing off. It just went on and on and on and then really arrived nowhere. The foreshadowing was not subtle. The sexual politics were rather annoying. It was a slog. I won't be trying any more of this author's books."
2,a travelogue of a boring place,"A young writer named Will Porter once wrote that Austin, Texas was ""fearfully dull.''In what passes for irony in ``A Twist at the End,'' it turns out that writer was none other than the man who would later be known as O'Henry, and he was about to become embroiled in the investigation of serial killings.Steven Saylor, whose books on a detective in ancient Rome also show off scads of research, clearly wants to write the Texas version of The Alienist. Unfortunately, the books suffers from too many subplots, and far too much of the ""look how much research I did'' school of atmosphere.``Fearfully dull"" says it all. The ``Twist at the End'' can be seen from about a hundred pages away-- for those who have the patience to stick around."
2,Failure to Cowboy,"Most of the novel is historically unbelievable.The main character , O. Henry, is out of characteras the man who wrote his famous short stories.The town marshal at the time of the Erp brothers in New Mexicois a stupid villain more like a Shakespeare sheriff than awestern lawman. The newspaperman bears noresemblance to men like Mark Twain who was the real thing.In a town of disenfranchised Mexicans, Negroes and Womenin the heart of "" Cattle is King"" Texas we are led to believe lifewas very much like that in East coast cities like New York.Other than that I guess the characterizations aren't all that bad.The cigar smoking madam is actually pretty good.I don't think Steven Saylor has even been to Texasor any western Museum.( As a native of Texas he should be deeply ashamed of this work.)As an historical novelthis is an abject failure.It did make me want to read Cabbages and Kings:Cabbages and Kings"
3,What Twist?,"I'm in a bit of quandary with this one. I did enjoy reading it, and thought the characters and setting were quite interesting. However, the writer doesn't make any secret of who the killers are, and I kept expecting some big O. Henry twist at the end in which the story would completely turn around and surprise me. Didn't happen; the story rambles along and ends up exactly where you expect it to. It was an entertaining ride: I just wish I hadn't been left with this ""What's the point?"" feeling..."
2,What a disappointment!,"After reading and highly enjoying all the Gordianus the Finder books by Saylor (which I do highly recommend), Twist at the End finds Saylor taking a new tact. Using O'Henry as the key character, we follow the unfolding of a series of brutal rape/murders in Austin, Texas in the late 1800's. Saylor shows he knows as much of this time period in Texas as he did about Ancient Rome...but somehow, the book left me cold. Perhaps it is the length, soem 550 pages, but about half way through, my one thought was ""get on with it, already!"". Not much of a twist at the end...it's obvious. In short, quite a letdown for an otherwise excellent author of ingenious historical mysteries."
2,Meandering tale of murder,"Based on the true-life Servant Girl Annihilator murders in Austin, Texas in 1885 , this book weaves both fact anf fiction. Unfortunately, the warp of this weave is very lose and full of holes. The main chatacter is William Porter, later to become famous as O. Henry...and many of the incidents are true (and a few echo famous murder trial of our day). The problem with this book is it meanders all about, from person to person and is drawn out almost to the point of tossing the book away. It has some interesting historical moments, but isn't as good a book as this unsolved mystery deserves."
3,Good Book -- Not As Good as The Alienist,"Saylor's best known for his Roma Sub Rosa Series, detailing the fictional life of Gordianus The Finder; this latest work is a bit of a departure for him and for most of his readers. The book starts off a little slowly but is a good read once you start understanding the numerous subplots. The topic of the book is fascinating and any fan of good historical fiction should enjoy this -- it's not as good as The Alienist by Caleb Carr but better than the sequel to that book. All in all this book doesn't disappoint and tells a good story. Fans of ancient historical fiction should pick up Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series -- they were outstanding."
4,A Twist in the End,"As one who loved Saylor's Roman mysteries, I purchased this book with great anticipation. The plot, concerning O. Henry and a true series of murders in 1884 and 1885 Austin, Texas, seemed intriguing. The beginning was great. Unfortunately, the story itself seemed to wander and, without giving too much away of the plot, the murders seemed curiously remote form the main character. In addition, the indentity of the murderer (or murderers?) becomes clear all to early in the book. I awaited the twist promised by the title, but found it predictable. Still, the book is worth reading."
5,"""A Twist at the End"" is better than...","""Servant Girl Annihilators""This is the first Steven Saylor book that I have read. And, I actually enjoyed it even though it is apparent early in the book who the killer or killers are, so go figure where the title came from. It is also apparent that Saylor has done extensive research to write this book. From an historical point of view I was enlightened on race relations as well as the rights of women and their place in late 1800's society. Also, how would you like to be a lawman trying to solve these heinous crimes without the use of fingerprints, DNA, etc.? Enjoyed it."
2,Not my type of series...,"Fushigi Yugi for me was a very difficult story for me to get into. It was so slow paced, that I lost interest about half way through volume 3. The story and plot just didn't keep my interest. I don't know, maybe its the whole 15 year old girl finding the love of her life in less than a week's time, or silly (and rather pathetic fight) between the two best friends. I will say however, that I did enjoy the artwork if anything. If your currious about this series, see if your local library has a copy (I know mine has a bunch of Fushigi Yugi volumes)instead of buying it."
2,THE BEST MAGNA BOOK EVER,"This is the best book ever!!It's about a 15 year old girl named Miaka who is a glutton and her best friend Yui who is trying to get into a high school that her mom wants her to get in but one day Miaka and Yui go to the library and Miaka and Yui find a book called the ""Universe of the Four Gods"" and they get sucked inside into a different world!!You're gonna have to get the book to read the rest and find out.Read the whole series, it's great!!(also try to watch the movie series)"
4,Chinese Romantic,"I don't know manga, but I know what I like. It's fairly good, this one. A girl named Miaka is trying to get into the high school of her mother's choice, but would rather be eating. She's a bit of a scatterbrain too. She stumbles on a book on Chinese mythology, a book that when read puts Miaka into the story, though she can leave whenever she wants as long as the book's open. She gets caught in the world, however, when the book is closed, and she discovers that the only way out is to gather together the ""seven constellations of Suzaku"" together. She develops a crush on one, another of them develops a crush on her, and another becomes jealous of her. Will she be able to find the others?It's fast paced and silly at times, rushing around with Miaka's personality. Cute pictures too. There's also some little comments from the author, Yu Watase, in the margins sometimes, which is interesting."
5,awesome!,"this cd is great from start to finish-lyrics are well-written, melodies are catchy and folky, and zach griff's vocals are as usual without equal"
5,BITCHES LIKE Sebastian,"Fucc Sebastian, he aint knowin skillz, Playboy 7's album Whore is a classic and rare atthat at finding, i highly recommend this album to anyone who love underground rap, Playboy 7 is a member of the great las vegas rap group DOOMSDAY PRODUCTIONS, tracks like Whore, Bitches Like U, Pocket Full O' Money, Cin Sity Party, and The Rules, make this album what it is, a claSICC MUTHAFUCCAZ!"
4,Great for kids who like mysteries!,"This book is great for kids who like short mysteries. Each chapter is a different mystery. My favorite was ""T'was a Dark and Stormy Night""."
3,Cute set but for very young gardeners,"This is a bright, cheery gardening set for young kids. However the tools are quite toy like in design. It will be a nice set for our 18 month old grandchild but I will look for something more realistic for our 4 year old granddaughter."
3,great beginner guide,"This book explains all the ins and outs of computer image technology. The product overviews are a nice guide to see what you might want to purchase. The main problem is it is out-of-date on the product versions, pricing (way high in most cases) and the technology - written when a first generation Pentium was still state of the art. If they update this it would rate higher."
2,Pray for better remixes,"Tori falls into the same slide that Madonna's latest singledoes with this release. Generic remixes of very quality songs bysub-standard producers. Nothing of distinction here because of the tired 'thumpthumpthump' of mediocre Eighties disco. 'She's Yr Cocaine' and 'Raspberry Swirl' swagger with more sexiness than even the most lengthy mix. Seems Tori could get some more daring mixes (Squarepusher, Roni Size, DJ Shadow come to mind, all who recently made killer interpretations of various artists) but instead we are stuck with these flaccids. Too bad the tunes aren't as hot as the cover. Disappointing. Looking fwd to ""Venus and Back"", though."
3,Tori Amos' a Bit Low on Strength w/ Bouncy Yet Boring Beats,"Tori Amos' lyrical ballad, Jackie's Strength, is remixed into a mainstream dance tune that should get clubgoers on their feet. But the beats sound similar to most other top 40 dance tunes on the charts currently. Tori has always been a ground breaker, and it is a bit disappointing that she did not forge new ground with this beautiful song that holds great potential for major revamping. Nonetheless, the dance mixes are still ""classic"" dance tunes that are very good. They are just not revolutionary nor mindblowing as we have come to expect from this extraordinary artist."
3,The real treat on this CD are the CD-ROM videos it includes.,"In your stereo-system, this will be the standard Tori single, consisting of the title track from the album as well as two piano-tinkling b-sides that sound a lot like most of her other piano-tinkling b-sides (and make toriphiles slightly unpset that they have to shell out ten bucks just for such ""rarities""). The real treat on this CD are the videos for Jackie's Strength and Raspberry Swirl (also from From The Choirgirl Hotel) which you can view on your CD-ROM using Quicktime. I gave this 3 stars; one for the title track and the other two for each of the videos."
4,THESE ARE REMIXES,If you like the song Jackie's Strength that doesnt mean youll like this cd maxi single. These are remixes Jackie's Strength dubbed and torn apart to create a GROOVE...and it works. I think the Dubs are the best...There's a mix where they extend Tori's line The Real Thing over and over making you wanna shake your hips. And as a bonus a fresh up to date recording of Father Lucifer. If you wanna hear Jackie's Strength in a new light This Is For You!
2,"well, i THOUGHT it'd be good","The reason I bought this single was because I love the song ""Jackie's Strength"" and its one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite performers. So, I was quite displeased when I made the discovery that the remixes are just like every other remix around, with no bit of originality, much less than Tori Amos deserves.The high points, which are few, are the ""Wedding Cake Remix"" and the ""Sylkscreen"" mix of ""Father Lucifer"". Still, there's little bite to even those, and to have such a gorgeous song be reduced to dance club mixes do make me a little perturbed.Tori is not incapable of good remixes, as the ""Cruel"", ""Spark"", and ""Raspberry Swirl"" remixes are really nice, but it doesn't always work like that I guess."
2,NOT VINYL,"I LOVE Tori Amos and have owned this single on CD for some time. I ordered this from an independent seller and it came in CD format, not Vinyl. This is the only reason for a low rating. The material contained within the single no matter what format would be a 5 if it weren't falsely labeled"
3,could of been better,"I like Tori remixed - remixes are meant to be enjoyed in clubs, and when your feeling the need to dance or feel good , image a world with no remixes - doubt half of us would know who Tori Amos is and im sure we wouldnt be dancing to tori in clubs. I myself discovered her by hearing a remix, which led me to find out more and come to love her many albums.But these ""wedding cake"" mixes of jackies strength are not the best. Was an acapella even used to remix this? Or was the beats just layered over the original?? It seems to me like the latter. In parts towards the end you can hardly hear tori for the beats are too loud. These could of had real potential if mixed correctly by some big name remixes at the time. The slyscreen mix of father lucifer is awesome. Can not find a fault. I actually prefer it to the original."
3,Angry local gets revenge...,"This is a mildly interesting and somewhat humorous look at localism in a surf town somewhere on the central coast of California. Not particularly well-written, but witty, with interesting insights on a culture clash between dot commers and local surf culture. The outcome is rather predictable, but still it is an amusing read.I will say that the author does a commendable job of rendering the populace of the quirky town that the book is set in and invoking a nostalgic feel for ""the good old days"". Daniel Duane's ""Caught Inside"" is a far better book, with greater insights into what it is to be on both sides of the ""local"" issue in a beach community."
5,Bounty Hunter by Mike Cross,"I think this is one of his best albums. Some of the songs are funny, some are not, but they all have a moral. Much of Mike's songs have a deep spiritual meaning. I love ""Chicken hawk"" and ""Bounty Hunter"".Mike and Pam"
3,"Some good, some...huh?","Here are the categories of images: animals, fish, birds, architecture, art supplies, bath, bottles and jars, cans, containers, books, clippers, clocks, watches, dials and guages, electrical equipment, flashlights, batteries, lightbulbs, electric fans, fences, gardening and yard supplies, guns.Lots of odd items I don't think would be very useful (really old inventions have no idea what they are, tubes of grease, cans of oil). Best parts in my opinion are animals, architecture, and electrical equipment.2500 seemed like it would be more...Quality of the illustrations is nice, though. Look old-timey, shaded linearts."
3,"Ok, but not great","The vase has a nice shape, but it just doesn't have the ""crystal clear"" look and doesn't seem to be made of crystal which is what it claims to be. The vase has some rough edges on the rims. I wasn't very impressed with it. Okay vase, but not great!"
4,A Good Introduction That Builds Confidence,This is a good introduction to the Rational Rose tool and the Rational method of developing software. A reader should have a prior introduction to UML even though nothing advanced is presented here. What the book does best is build your confidence for tackling a large scale project using UML and Rational Rose to develop the object model. While the book includes some step by step instructions and tracks a development project from beginning to end it is not a definitive guide. The review is very broad brush. Terry Quatrani writes very clearly and for the most part fulfills the objectives that she sets out. There were a couple of points that I could not follow even rereading multiple times and I found myself wanting just a little more explanation of illustrations.
4,Excellent guide to the intricacies of Rational Rose,"This book was an excellent resource. As a guide to learning Rational Rose, it was great value. I think that some of the reviewers might have misunderstood the intention of the book. It is not meant to be a UML tutorial - a basic knowledge of UML is assumed for readers of this text. The book is all about applying UML using Rational Rose, and as a book with this aim it succeeds admirably. It is far more succinct than the Rational documentation, and it also includes practical ongoing exercises to work through as you read. I've been using Rational Rose for about a year, but this book was great for being able to learn all the esoteric aspects of the program & how the UML is used within it."
4,Good entry point for Rational Rose and UML,"I never seen Rational Rose before. I didn't know UML. When I installed Rose, I did need a rapid way to use it and an intro to UML. Well, I choosed this book and in few days I developed my first application using design approach insead of never died procedural approach. 20 days in analisys (mixed with book reading). 30 days in coding (without the help of ""Build Code"" Rational Rose option). An excellent result that surprised all my collaborators.If this is what you are looking for... Buy this book!I learnel UML concept too. And for the future, I beleave that I must read some other book on UML. This will improve my design skill.For a rapid approach to the tecnology involved, this book is good. Hence 4 stars."
2,Barely a good Intro -- some errors!,"After reading the book, I initially thought it was a good value. Then I tried to construct my own model using the student version of Rose 4.0. I really struggled. The book does not show the BIG picture and there is not enough detail to figure out how some of the diagrams are related.Also I think I found at least one error in the models. I tried to construct a component diagram similar to her Figure 11-10. Rose would not let me associate any of the interfaces with Professor.exe."
2,suresh.kannan@cad.gatech.edu,A very disconnected book and very light on content. This is definitely not for people who want to learn UML. A tutorial for Rose should take the reader from scratch to building the application. By placing the content between being a UML intro and Rose tutorial and not continuing along a single thread Ms. Quattrani lost my interest right from the beginning.
5,Great intro to concepts needed to visualize software systems,A well needed introduction for the majority of IT professionals and organizations out there who are just beginning to look towards Visual Modeling as a cure for their devlopment problems. Terry does an excellent job of guiding the reader through the fundamentals of visual modeling and proves that you don't have to be a UML guru to begin utilizing visual modeling. IT professionals have to start somewhere - start by reading this book!
1,Rose's on-line help files are more useful than this book.,This book just does not live up to its title. There is no serious discussion on any topic covered in it. Adding word 'Introduction' to the title would increase its mark to 4.
2,Not much content,"In the tradition of Fowler and then Quatrani, I'm going to start out by telling you what this book isn't:1) It is not a good book2) It is not a very useful book3) It is not a good value for the moneyWell then, what is it? It's a simple-minded tutorial of Rose and visual modeling ( heavy on the simple minded ). I was looking for a book with a lot more meat in it. This is the kind of book I might pay $7.99 for if I felt flush. The book would be more appropriately titled ""Basic Visual Modeling"" or something. It's not advanced enough - heck, it's not even intermediate enough. Perhaps, like Fowler, she didn't want to put much into it so she wouldn't step on the three amigos' toes since they're writing their own books on the subject. I hope those books will be better."
1,not true,"If you are a fan of fictional genocides, this is a good read. If you are interested in the complete truth, you have to read other books. In the period mentioned in the book, practically everybody was killing everybody else in a country torn by ethnic strife fueled by imperialist foreigners. Innocent ethnic Greeks were killed, yes, but keep in mind that lots of innocent Turks also perished. Calling this kind of nightmare a ""genocide"" is just an inappropriate use of the word."
5,Good purchase. Looking forward to reading the book.,Good purchase. Looking forward to reading the book. It was suggested in my Bible Study Session.
3,Not last Death March in the history,"This is not unique, not first, and I am afraid will not be the last Death March in the history. It is Boers in South Africa, Aborigines in Australia and Canada, Irishmen in Ireland in 1800s, Scotsmen in Highlands, intellectuals in Russia, Jews in Nazi Germany, Bosnians in Sarajevo, Azeries in Karabag, Tibetians in China . It is sad, it is tragic. We all know that war is tragic. There is no winners, all loosers. It is good to know, however wit some misleading, some incorrect details, which are difficult for the writer to avoid, but generally a good wrap-up family history. No more. Do not expect remunarations, no political advantage, if you are after. A strong, economically sound, powerful Turkey is a must for America, for the writer, and for the readers. A good book to read, especially for those repeatedly and unnecessarily accused since 1915."
1,It was jihad,"What a pity that Halo could not, not even now, name the annihilators. The ""turkish military""? It was Islam.This kind of perfect dhimmitude is Islam's greatest achievement, the complicity of their victims."
5,An important story,"I am so grateful to author Thea Halo for putting down in words the tragedy that her mother endured as a young child in Asia Minor. My grandmother's own childhood was shattered by similar events, when she fled from the Ottoman Army as they burned her home town to the ground. I'd listened to her horrific tales of survival my whole life countered with the denial of the Turkish government. When genocide is 'swept under the carpet', it's just a matter of time before the same tragic history repeats itself.Now Ms. Halo has enabled the reader to truly grasp the scale of this tragedy by interspersing Themia's sad personal story with her very thorough research.I found this book to be haunting, yet inspiring."
5,Not Even My Name,"Great book , my father was a Greek immigrant and told us of many stories of what he lived thru when the Turks were fighting the Greeks. I cried thru the whole thing. So very very real!"
4,"Genocide is not a happy subject, but...","Almost unknown in the all-too-common annals of the tragic history of genocide is the annihilation of Greeks who had lived for 3000 years in the mountains near the Black Sea. After WWI, the entire population of one village, including 10yo Sano Halo, was forced on a one-year death march to Syria. Sano became separated from her family and even lost her name when she was purchased by a man three times her age. Eventually she and the man, by then a married couple, moved to NY, and there Sano raised 10 children, including the author.A tale of resilience and grace, lacking the anger and regret so often found in such survivor stories."
4,Good Tintin album,"This book, made by Herge just before World War II, is a good addition to the Tintin collection. It's the first time the fictional country of Syldavia appears, a Central European country (monarchy at the time, in later albums a pseudostalinist republic) which would later send the first men to the moon!. I think this is probably the best of the pre-Haddock albums. In the book, Tintin comes to the rescue of its King Ottokar, as a quasi-fascist conspiracy tries to overthrow him (the leader of the conspiracy is one Musstler = Mussolini + Hitler). It has a great opening (Tintin gets involved in all the trouble just by finding a lost suitcase in a park bench) and after that is consistently entertaining. The best part: the stealing of the sceptre at the castle. It also features the first appearance by Bianca Castafiore, the nightingale of Milan."
4,Herge just stays in touch with reality,"A nice peace of work by Herge (as always). Although Tintin and snowy always used to travel to existing and real places, this time they are off to Syldavia, a country of sheer imagination. I rank it a four-star because of that lack of educational element. Apart from that, a good book in the best of Herge tradition."
3,like Chinese food,"It is akin to the old saw about Chinese food, an hour later your still hungry. Unfortunately, it was not for more from this group. I felt nothing stuck, no real passion or or beauty."
4,Linda's Quiereme Mucho,"Recently I was struck by the way Linda sang Quiereme Mucho, my favorite old song, which was aired on radio in Japan. It was the first time that I heard Linda's version. Since the album containing this rendition was no londer available in Japan I managed to acquire Frenesi through the help of Amazon.com USA."
3,"Technically good, but sparse","Justin Vali is a modern-day master of the national instrument of Madagascar, the valiha. His technical wizardry shines through on this album, where his playing solo allows the complexity and rapidity of his playing to stand out. But many of these songs are old classics for him, such as Bilo, which has featured on three of his albums now. Unless you are a hardcore purist, I would recommend this album only to JV fanatics. I feel other albums he's made (such as the excellent ""Ny Marina - The Truth"" on the Real World label) are equally faithful to the traditional sounds of the highlands, but benefit enormously from the addition of backup singers, more percussion and additional acoustic instruments. It's when all these elements are put together that one can really appreciate the full beauty of the music of the Malagasy highlands. Get ""Ny Marina"" instead."
4,Little Bits o' Everything,"I first discovered this band on Mtv. Ha! What a joke... but 1 a.m. does harbor some good music. Well i didnt know exactly what Darkside would be like, but i bought the cd anyway. The lyrical content is not so shabby, but the music rocks. Its like Limp Bizkit meets Korn, and a whole bunch of other cool stuff put into one. Revolutionary sounds, fun, original... This is the real thing! The RETURN OF ROCK! This album rocks."
3,Thanks,"Just wanted to say thanks... I, of course, picked the wrong edition, but I managed to survive. The other party was timely and efficient. I am grateful."
5,Highly recommend,Used this textbook for my History of Furniture class...a great reference that I will keep when I finish the class as well. Glossary for terms is really weak but there are a lot of pictures demonstrating pieces.
5,Fantastic!,"I checked this out from the public library and now am purchasing is because it is a book that I will return to again and again. Not only do the authors explain why history has taken a back seat in current education trends, but they go on to also explain how to assess the history education your child is receiving. But, the best part of the book is in the back. The authors have given the reader tools to supplement your child's education by explaining the reason for each federal holiday (and there a ALOT!), listing websites to learn more about the holiday, and providing a state by state review of the best historical places to visit. For ""Great Americans"" like my husband and I, this book is a must have!"
5,How to raise an American,I look forward to reading the book. I was bless to hear hear speak. She truly loves this country and wants young children to understand and be proud to live in the greatest country in the world. Everyone who has children should own this book.
1,Let's ignore reality,"There are times, perhaps, when it is wise to protect your children by withholding the truth. This is not one of them. Please consider this book to be a fine example of what is wrong with our beloved, beleaguered country. Ignoring painful realities is not helpful, to ourselves or our children."
3,presumption,"It seems overly presumptuous to attempt to instill particular beliefs in your childern. The role of a parent is to foster education and knowledge, teach your childern how to think critically for themselves and not rely on others to form their all important beleifs. Attempting to dictate your childs point of view is extremely detrimental to their intellectual development and if American parents are to do this it will inevitably lead to a far weaker nation in the future. The best way to contribute to your child forming a positive point of view of his country is to contribute in making America a better place."
1,How to Raise a World Citizen,"Please, please Myrna Blyth, forget about raising US patriots and focus on raising world citizens, whoever they are, wherever they are. That way might lie peace. That way might lie love of our environment. That way might lie justice."
4,Nice for the price.,"You can have better ones, but this one is a really good compromise between the quality and the price. I'm very happy with it."
2,A Paradigm with a Purpose,"Although Huntington presents a sweeping alternative to the recently antiquated bipolar paradigm of international relations and politics, his new unit of analysis does not address many of the issues at hand. He overlooks possible explanations of the current world political situation because of the new lenses of civilization-based analysis. He also minimizes the forces of economic development in the formation of post-Cold War blocs. The conclusions and policies that follow the paradigm presented in The Clash, are domestically xenophobic and internationally isolationist. The portrait of global politics presented by Huntington is neither true for the present nor desirable for the future."
3,ups and downs,"Huntington (Weatherhead) develops a compelling arguement on the order and importance of civilizations after the Cold war. Unfortunately, though, his biases are as easy to read as his text. While there are highly learned insights of political science, there lacks a deeper sociological consideration over the subject matter. The most damning point finds itself towards the end of the book when Huntington writes about the clash in the former Yugoslavia, ""The peace process was also helped by the ethnic cleansing which occured""(p.298). Any common sense will tell you that ethnic cleansing only leaves festering wounds and never ""helps"". At best the book is a focused analysis. At worst the book becomes too focused and suffers from the kind of instrumental rationality one expects from Harvard. It has its ups and it has its downs."
4,Geopolitical projections that will trigger hours of debate.,"You might challenge page after page of detail and argument that Huntington uses to make his points (I did), but on the overall conclusions it's hard to disagree. This is an insightful work on the geopolitical changes we can expect to shape the next 50 years. And if you find yourself writing hundreds of counter arguments in the margins, well that's half the fun. A worthwhile read anytime"
3,Spengler or Toynbee it's not!,"Its value much exaggerated, this book is a good example of what political scientists do. What they do is to try to pretend that their work is scientific when it is actually quite speculative and subjective. I got more from Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee, who had some philosophical training and historical perception, than from this academic spinner."
2,Huntington Shows His Anglo-Saxon Bias,"Huntington is a historian who tries to understand the dynamics of world politics through simplistic -almost mathematical- concepts. Unfortunately , his views will almost certainly turn out to be irrelevant as the ruling anglo-saxon elites in America become the minority. His Anglo-centric views will then have to make way to catering to other ethnic lobby groups , as US politicians cater for their votes."
2,Interesting but flawed,"Huntingdon's thesis is interesting but offers very little outside of Eastern Europe (where I think his analysis is a little stronger). His take on Islam is wrongheaded and shallow, and virtually nothing useful in predicted about China.It's interesting how, just around the time that we needed to find some new enemies and justifications for conflict with them, we have Huntingdon and his ""Clash of Civilizations"". I can't help but think that this is too convenient. While I don't agree with the End of History crowd or any other such triumphalist movements, I think Huntingdon is, fundamentally, looking for trouble.I worry that the ""civilizational fault lines"" idea could become a reality if enough influential people start believing it. Western foreign policy wonks have a astounding ability to distort reality; remember the way that African civil wars suddenly acquired ""more communist"" and ""more democratic"" sides during the Cold War?"
2,Clash?,"Well i just can tell mister Huntington that's it is another life, the real life in the streets. He should take a walk and talk to people, regular people. The book just shows how unplugged he is from reality. One thing is to read and read, and another its to prove that the things that he writes got any connection with reality."
5,It helps to clarify a very complex world.,"I travel worldwide as part of my job. It never ceases to amaze me how similar individuals seem to be but how different the groups we belong to behave. This book goes a long way in explaining the differences between cultures and gives Western thinkers a basis for understanding the world. The West has continued to harbour illusions about the rest of the world and has a collective guilt regarding our success's militarily and economically. In order to make sense of others, it is clear that we must first accept ourselves and understand how we are viewed by others. This book clearly explains the reality of shifting geopolitcal alliances. We had better pay heed to his warnings. China and Islam are both prepared to take our dominant place in the world. As our Eastern friends tells me all the time ""You are like children, too busy making money and too selfish to see anything beyond your own needs"". This book is excellent."
3,Interersting book,"This book is interesting. It is perceived as dramatic in its boldness regarding the possible clash of civilizations.It is highly intuitive to expect that one human group could fight another based on values (culture). Hence, it is not surprising that war and violence may errupt as cultures (values) collide in the modern day accessible world. This, by itself, should not be a highly provoking thought.This could be clear to any child readig events of world history. Cultures and like-affinity-groups have often clashed to overpower others. Why does it take 200+ pages to understand the lessons of human history - that history repeats itself; that humans don't learn from history; and that religion (or culture or civilization or values) are ""dividers"" (us versus them)?"
1,A wrongheaded paradigm for our time,"Samuel Huntington has a feeling for what America's foreign policy elite wants to hear. After he recommended in the 60s that America should prop up authoritative regimes (in 'Political Order in Changing Societies') he now wants us to believe that the rest of the world is full of irrational lunatics that are somehow loyal to so-called 'civilizations'. His thesis is empirically wrong and leads to false conclusions. See for a sweeping critique Stephen M. Walt, 'Building up new Bogeymen"", Foreign Policy, No. 106, Spring 1997, or Yahya Sadowski, The Myth of Global Chaos (1998)."
3,Dated and dull,"I bought this book without checking what year it was written. It's all pre-911 and quite outdated I thought. The book was written before the Japanese economy imploded in the 1990s and when it was thought the Japanese would overcome America.I did like the perspectives on civilizations and some interesting points are made about China and the ""Orthodox culture.""It was also quite a dull read!"
3,Average,While the erudition of Mr.Huntington cannot be denied a historian of Russia and Orthodoxy has to be very wary to look at the worlkd politics through his 'clash of civilizations' picture. It is just too problematic to make such sweeping generalizations. There many levels on which this analysis just does not work and not only for teh Orthodox world.
4,"Important analysis, questionable conclusions","Samuel Huntington has been called everything from a racist bigot to one of the most brillant minds of the 20th century. Reading the ""Clash of Civilizations"" prepares one to grapple with the complex and important issues of today.Huntington's thesis is that the world is understand neither from traditional realist principles which centre on the nation-state, or liberal principles which centre on values such as freedom and interdependence. The world is understood through the clash and intermingling of different cultures. Huntington's analysis is interesting and in a lot of cases, bang on.However in some issues, Huntington interprets things too simplistically and without context. He makes rather disturbing comments about the Islamic world that can be interpreted as small-minded. Nonetheless everyone would be wise to read it himself and be the judge."
2,"Only applies towards middle east, not elsewhere","Like Bernard Lewis, this author likes to portray a clash between West and Middle East.But look at the other countries: nobody is fighting the west, not even the Chinese.Does anybody really think we can't get along?This book is true only for the Middle East.As for the rest of the thesis, that developing countries catch up with developed countries, this is a well known economic phenomena, nothing worth fretting over."
4,Not as new as claimed,"The book is maybe 75% new, though it was claimed to be like new. Everything else went well as promised."
3,World Order and the Forces attempting to Dominate Societies,"If you really want a true evaluation on the what we, the free people of the world, are experiencing and why we must continue seeking knowledge - such as this book - go read this one - it's hard to get - but read it: Babylon's Covert War"
4,"Move over Morganthau, here comes Huntington","This is a great book if you aspire to political Realism, but I do not. Huntington creates a self-fulfilling prophecy; this is the inherent flaw of Realism. If you are ready to march to the beat of war once again, then this book will get you revved up. In all fairness, this book doesn't deserve a one star because it is well written and the arguments are solid. I just don't agree with Huntington's political views. I would recommend reading this book, regardless of your position on international politics. If you disagree with this book, you will have a good time debunking it. If you agree with it, then you have more arguments under your belt. Huntington seems to feel that we define ourselves by who are enemies are (or who we are not), and to a certain extent he is right. The problem with that it creates perpetual conflict. If we can free ourselves from this twisted method of thought, war may very well cease to exist."
4,The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order,"A very well researched book that suddently came again into the high-light after September 11th. Although easily written, but due to the complex subject, it must be read in installments. Unless the reader has an elevated level in international politics or a field near to it. The book is an excellent base for those working within the media and / or the international envirnoment. In order to creat an own opinion about this complex situation, every mature citizen should read this book and use it as a reference material.A further edition should cover the recent developments."
2,An overly simplistic and inaccurate global paradigm.,"Mr. Huntington's categorization of the various religions and cultures of the world is overly simplistic and historically inaccurate. For example, his reference to the ""Islamic Civilization"" assumes a unity and cohesion among Islamic nations that simply does not exist. The various divisions that exist within Islam, and more importantly, the divisions that exist among Arab nations undermines Mr. Huntington's premise of a unified Islamic front ready to confront the West."
5,After 9/11,"After the September 11th episode I needed to know some background of the terrorists we were going to deal with. And since I knew nothing of the Arabic culture or the Islamic religion and how either would influence their population's behavior or ideology, I thought this book would give me some insight or a more objective worldwiew of the future we face. Whether or not Huntington's information is accurate, his book has at least exposed me to a broader picture of changing civilizations and the effect it has on all cultures. This book has served my reason for buying it."
3,Wrong for all the right reasons,"If I had written a review of this book when I first read it, I probably would have given it the full 5 stars. However, the events of September 11, 2001 seem to have invalidated much of what Huntington has to say. We are not seeing the alignment of Islamic countries against the decadent west. We are seeing that Arab-Islamic countries and non-Arab-Islamic countries cannot be easily classified. Saudi Arabia and Jordan remain in uneasy truce with the west. Indonesia and the powerful Islamic block of India do not fit the picture. I recommend this book, but don't take the idea that fault lines between civilizations are in any way real."
5,Excellent,"This book has in-depth research and clear presentation, and is still quite relevant to our ""Arab Spring"" period. The only people who submit negative reviews or this book are either Muslims practicing taqiyya (deceiving the infidels) or leftist apologists for Islam who read nothing except books by Saudi-funded Muslim apologists like Karen Armstrong, John Esposito and Edward Said. Huntington's book is highly recommended."
1,The typic american view of the world,"I didn't finish this book yet . But i've already the feeling that the author's point of view depends on the American position in this world .The only superpower facing around the world rebellions against its authority . Even the most trusted allies dare today to disagree on several crucial points (WTO, NATO's future, etc.)with .Considering the diplomatic evolution in the western world : the european will to build an Independant (read from the states) United Europe .the western world as he like to call it, has never been so divided .His view of the muslim world far from any unity, is also quite simplistic .All I see in this book, is the crucial need for the USA to trust allies . The need of the states to be part of something and to lead something .That's not a global view of the world It is a sophisticated american view of the world : ""the good men led by me against the bad ones (the others)"" ."
2,Huntington's theory is full of holes,"After studying Huntington's theory of international relations in college here at the University of Utah I can say definitively that Mr. Huntington has much work to do to clear up many of the problems of his theory. I find it an interesting idea, that's why two stars but he really needs some work to make it more cohesive. However, Edward Said's response to it is well thought out and constructed."
2,it's not that good,"well, i was happy with Samuel Huntington's Third Wave, but this one seems too political and not so much based on theoretical research. i like his ideas about civilization, but he doesn't show much respect for the Arab nations, and tries to present policy that further alienates and isolates Arab countries."
3,Just a note,"This concept of the clash of civilizations wasprobably first brought up by Francis Fukuyama inhis book ""The End of the History and the LastMan"" published in 1992. At the endof Chapter 21 of that book, it states:""And the persistence of these differences maymean that international life will be seenincreasingly as a competition not between rivalideologies--since most economically successful stateswill be organized along similar lines-- but betweendifferent cultures."
4,simplistic but need to know,Short and sweet:Read this if: 1) you want one view of how some theorists are thinking about the shape of international relations after the end of the Cold War and you don't mind a simplistic view of Islam; 2) you are interested in a somewhat novel argument against US intervention abroad that moves beyond human rights and international law. Don't read this if: 1) you don't have a lot of time and have already read his article in Foreign Policy; 2) you'll be angered by a view that is still somewhat Eurocentric.
4,Clash of Ideas,"First of all, I must disclaim, that I haven't read this entire book. I've read excerpts of Huntington's work over the years and find his cultural approach to the world interesting and informative, yet overly simplified. I challenge anybody who is reading this book to consider alternative theorists such as Alfred Stepan, who debunks Stepan claim that Islam is incompatible with democracy in ""Arguing Comparative Politics"" chapter 11. A few points worth mentioning is how about 40% of Muslim live in democracies or semi-democracies. He also counters with various excerpts from the Koran that may encourage tolerance, writings and interviews with Muslim clerics, etc.Also to minimize ideology and economic dependency as potential causes for ""clashing of civilization"" ignores a great deal of established literature on the subject. But again, I havent read the entire book so I'm not sure how he would address this."
5,A Wonderful Debut for the Richmond Author!!!!,I truly enjoyed Spices of Life! The characters were so life like and I felt as if I were there in the book from beginning to end. I recommend this for a great page-turning read to anyone who's up to the challenge of love! Get it!
3,Not in the top tier,"The Shooting gallery: A Detective Yablonsky Mystery is not in the same class as books by Michael Connelly, Jefferson Parker or John Hart whose books are all uniformly much better. I haven't read ""The Bone Orchard"" but thought The Shooting Gallery was not believeable in many incidents with too much suspension of disbelief required to accept it."
5,Revenge of the Goldfish - Inspiral Carpets,"Even after a few years, this album still sounds great to my ears. I recall the day I heard ""Dragging me down"" on a ""Live to Air"" radio broadcast from a local bar a radio station I grew up listening to over the border in Toronto was doing and it was a great tune. From then on I purchased this album and have been a fan ever since, other notable tracks on this album which in my opinion are solid are ""Two Worlds Collide, Bitches Brew and Disappeared."" I would definitely suggest if you are a fan of the alternative movement from the 90s this should be included in your library of CDs."
4,Very complete,This book is a very interesting book to learn the main statistical approach of data mining. It's clear and full of examples. If you go a Stanford data mining website you will find all the courses and exercises linked to the book.An important book to have in your own data mining library.
4,For statisticians in data mining,"Here are my impressions about the book.* The organization of book is clear and concise. No too lengthy and fuzzy discussions. Method and technique explanations are clear though sometimes bit hard to follow.* Liberal usage of colors. It helps to make drawings more attractive and to show more info. May be too bright for some.* My parts like SVM and LDA, PCA.... they seem to be explained in quite difficult way. Though it is clear enough and self-sufficient* There are many references and pointers to original works and related fields. Big plus here.* Work and results on real sample data. I particularly enjoy it! It helps to better understand each method and its +/-This is a good book for those who use statistics for data mining. It seems that there is more accent on probabilistic (frequentist) field. Though a reader is expected to have good enough level in maths to grasp the concepts quickly. May not be appropriate for the beginners in the field."
3,Most used book but lacks accessibility,"Granted it is aimed for higher level grad courses it still lacks some accessibility for those who wish to implement the techniques using R or other software by coding it directly from the theory in the book. It can and is done, but could be easier without being less rigorous."
2,Covers many topics breifly,"I was already familiar with many of the topics covered in this book, but had to do a double take when reading about familiar concepts. Unfortunately, the authors' unique perspective is not presented in a way that is benificial to the reader. I would strongly suggest another book as a reference or introduction to this material."
2,Not recommended as a text book,I had to use this book as the text book for a Machine Learning course at MIT and it was not very understantable. There are much better Machine Learning text books.
3,Too wordy,"Having to go thru some of the data mining such as CART, I find the book rather wordy. Sometimes, it takes a couple of readings to understand, too many termiologies. I think a lot of stuff might be better illustrated with mathematical formulae rather than words or both. For e.g., I was trying to understand what is surrogate variable, getting a big picture from the English is okay, but to actually compute it, I find information not as clear. This book is written in a way ... seem to be theoretical, and yet not rigorous enough.A lot of examples, but I do hope it's not so long-winded in description."
4,El libro de la mineria de datos,"Desde el punto de vista tecnico este libro es sumamente completo ya resume muy bien muchos de los metodos estadistico que se aplican en la mineria de datos. Pero a mi parecer este libro es debil en cuanto a la descripcion de ciertos algortimos que describe, y en algunos casos solo se menciona el procedimiento como una formula (la matriz S de los trazadores cubicos) ya que presupone que el lector ya tiene un buen conocimiento sobre trazadores cubicos.Este no es un libro introductorio de mineria de datos, se tiene que tener un cierto nivel en analisis estadistico multivariado"
2,Do not buy a book without flipping it.,"That's what happened to me respect this book. Conclusion: DO NOT BUY ANY BOOK, EVER, WITHOUT FLIPPING IT. OTHER'S REVIEW ARE NOT RELIABLE. This is the third time I bougth a book based on other's review. I repented."
4,The Elements of Statistical Learning,"The book by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman is a welcomeaddition to the quickly growing area of machine learningand data mining. This is a well written book, laid outnicely with excellent examples by 3 well establishedresearchers in the field. It will be helpful to thosewho are interested in learning about this field, as wellas experts who want to know moreMy only complaint is that although the authors domake an honest attempt to clearly highlight methodsthat are based on their own research,often this distinction becomes cloudy and the readeris left with the impression that the methodsadvocated are often the best and representthe standard in the industry. In fact many oftheir ideas are only heuristic and it is more thanconceivable that these will eventually be superseededwith better methods.A good book, which gets you up to speed in the literaturebut it will only be relevant for a few years."
2,Not recommended as a learning text,"This is not an introduction to statistical learning theory. It is a collection of overviews of various statistical methods presented rather than explained to the reader. In order to benefit from this book the reader should have a good background in matrix algebra and should already have a theoretical and working knowledge of the topics covered. For detail on the methods and their real world application the reader should also be prepared to consult other references. Two stars because, fairly or not, it does not have the pedagogical value that I expected of it."
3,A good but shallow book,"Among my commercial data mining friends this book is considered to be the bible. It is worth having just to assess the mindset of the day-to-day data miners. The book discusses many data mining issues in more depth than most of the earlier works on this subject. However it still lacks the the depth and counsel of, say, applied multiple regression books (cf. Draper and Smith) that give guidance on when a particular method may give false results or how bogus results can be detected posteriori."
4,Fun toy for my 8 year old...savvy,"We got this for our 8 year old boy and he loves it. I remember loving action figures at his age as well. It is a great toy to fuel the imagination as his pirates battle his Star Wars figures. If your child likes actions figures and Pirates, I recommend it!"
3,Count the spokes,I was unable to use this because I needed a 36 spoke wheel. This one only has 32 spokes. My application was for motorized bicycles. 38 spoke wheels are needed for rear sprocket adapters.
4,Great calendar but not for keeping family schedule,I love Kandinsky's artwork. Love the artwork above the calendar but the actual calendar squares don't have a lot of space. I purchased this to write down the family schedule - we have a lot going on. But for good or bad the calendar lists every holiday from around the world. Some squares have holidays more than four deep. Since I couldn't return the opened calendar I took white out and went through all 12 months. So if it's hanging on your wall for artwork it's great but for a household calendar it really doesn't work.
5,limited accessories,"Great camera . . . one of the few lower priced cams to keep the mic jack and the headphone jack, but beware . .. . this camera does NOT come with a lens cap, and NO remote control. other sources state that this camera does NOT have a Leica lens. This camera does NOT have A/V input. No flash, no hot accessory shoe (though it has one which has no power). No widescreen LCD. It does record in widescreen but no image stabilization in widescreen."
3,Great while it worked,"This was a great camera while it worked. One day the power didn't come on despite a full battery. There is no way to eject the tape with the power off. It costs almost as much to repair it as to buy a new one - but in order to get your tape out ( assuming you were taping something important - like in my case a graduation) you have to send it in for repair and hope they return it.This is a very poor design. When I researched the web for a way to take the tape out, it appears that this is a fairly common problem. The camera worked for around 18 months."
3,Low light seems to be problematic,"I haven't decided if I want to return this camcorder yet. I got sucked into the 3CCD thing after reading a lot of great reviews. But honestly, I'm not seeing a huge difference in quality compared to the older technology. Also, i'm struggling with lighting. Indoors, the picture appears too dark. I'm considering purchasing a light, but I'm not happy about it, but it tends to distract the people you're shooting. I'm going to play around with it for a little while longer and see if i can find a different setting that works, but I doubt it because I've already read the manual."
4,"Decent, but awkward to clean","I bought this feeder at Lowe's, not Amazon.com. Yes, it is made out of plastic but it is a nice little feeder. I have hummers that feed from it everyday. The base detaches from the can and that is easy to clean but you need a bottle brush to clean the watering can part-very awkward. Consider that when purchasing this product as well as the fancy looking glass models."
3,"Fun, simple game","I had never played any Katamari games before I received this one for Christmas. My brother thought they were a lot of fun, so I downloaded the demo off of Xbox Live and decided that I wanted to purchase Beautiful Katamari.I like this game pretty well, and it is fun, but there are a few aspects about it that I do not like. For example, the king in the game is very very negative toward the prince and is constantly blocking the screen with his unnecessary commentary. Also, occasionally, the screen angles are terrible and you won't be able to see where you are going, and in turn, can get stuck. The graphics can also be glitchy.Overall, I do like to play this game. It is a nice, fun game that I play when I am not in the mood for anything complicated. I won't say that it is easy because the 'roll up hot things level' is not every easy, lol, but it is a game that doesn't seem to require a lot of thought."
5,Fun and Addicting!,"This game is super cute and challenging, and the music is pretty catchy too. It took me a little while to get the hang of things since I have not yet played the other versions in the Katamari series. Loved it, it is great both for kids and adults who are tired of hack and slash."
3,Still Katamari,"This edition in the Katamari series was too short, I played through the entire game in about 3 hours, there wern't even 10 levels. They expect you to buy more levels on their xbox live market place. The graphics are very pretty though, the HD makes a huge diffrence."
4,Worth Playing,"As a fan of the Katamari series I was interested in the game when it was released. However they went away from its budget minded price, after Amazon made it a Deal of the Day I jumped. The main game is kind of short you could finish the game in one setting if you wanted. The replay value is there find all the cousins and present makes it worth playing over and over. The music is fantastic, controls are good, and the graphics are an improvement over the PS2 games while keeping it's charm. Over all a good pick."
3,Price Makes it Worth a Purchase if You are a Katamari Fan,"I love the other Katamari games but I found this one a bit of a disappointment. The graphics are exactly the same as the other games in the series even though this game is on a new system and the stages look very similiar. Speaking of the stages, however, they may look similiar but there seemed to be a lot less that was interesting and funny to roll up.The game was fun to play because the controls were quite simple to use, but the game is quite short and does not contain anything new. It is pretty cheap so if you like the Katamari games this is probably worth a purchase. If you are new to the series of games and have one of the other systems I'd think about getting one of the other games as you will probably get a longer game play out of them."
2,Very Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in the new Katamari game! One of the things I really enjoyed about previous installments was the variety of challenges, but so far all of the levels fit the profile of make a katamari of x size in y amount of time. There are ""fast as you can"" type challenges, but they're only for online rankings, not for level completion. Not having a variety of challenges means that if you aren't good at one kind, the game isn't going to be much fun."
5,Katamari FTW!,"I purchased this game back in 2009 from k-mart for $5.00. They hadn't been selling well because not many people were familiar with it. This game is just plain weird, but it's horribly addictive. It's a lot of fun to play. I'd recommend it to just about anybody. Once you get the hang of it, you can go for hours. People will joke about you for playing this game, but who are they to knock such an awesome game? haha"
3,Not as good,"I have to say I was a little disappointed. I have Katamari Damacy and We <3 Katamari for ps2, so I was glad they were releasing an xbox360 version since that's what console I went to next. So of course I had to get it. But honestly, We <3 Katamari was so much better. The gameplay was longer, there were more interesting things to roll up. This one... it's just back to basic and has even fewer levels than the first game. I was kinda disappointed by that.There are still the cousins that you can run into and kick and play as. Multiplayer is ok. But yeah. Just the fact that there are fewer levels and not as many different challenges as in We <3 Katamari, I don't think I would have bought this game as much as I love the series."
4,Great Game!,"This is the fist time the Katamari Franchise has appeared on the Xbox 360 and it is my first experience with its weird world. Beautiful Katamari is a fun whimsical game that will draw you in from the moment you first start playing. Even the menu system and the level selection is presented in an undeniably charming way. As for the gameplay it is a lot of fun to roll up Katamari and you're rewarded for trying to build the biggest and best version. You'll probably find yourself playing the levels multiple time to try and beat your high score. The game is not very long, but with the high replay and amount of fun you'll have, it is well worth the price."
3,Not impressed,"My roommate in college had the first two Katamari games for PS2, and they were so much fun that I decided to buy the XBox360 version for myself. However, I was very disappointed. I found the camera angles while playing very difficult to work with- the game was much easier to play on Playstation. Also, if you are prone to motion-sickness at all, I would advise sticking to PS. While the first two Katamari games didn't bother me at all, I quickly realized that Katamari on XBox makes me VERY nauseous after about ten minutes- I had to stop playing to be sick. Thinking it was something I ate, I tried playing again a week later, and again one time after that, with the same result. This may sound silly, but I have never had that problem with a video game before (except Super Monkey Ball), so I thought it was worth mentioning."
4,Beautiful Katamari,This game is addictive. So much fun. Even my friend who doesn't really like video games loves this one.
3,A Great Distraction,"When you're in a bad mood, when you don't feel like using your head, or if you're just bored, this is the perfect game. I love this game because it's very relaxing. Don't get me wrong, it's extremely trippy and strange in all aspects, but it calms me down. I compare it to Geometry Wars. Your mind is focused when you play this game, but it feels numb because you seem to get lost in space (pun intended). The storyline is ridiculous of course, the achievements are excruciatingly difficult to receive, and the game doesn't last very long. Aside from those cons, it's a great game. It will make you laugh so much and the silly songs will be stuck in your head for days. It's not too difficult to beat the story, so the kids will enjoy it, too."
3,Not as Good as Previous Katamaris,"I've played the first two Katamari games extensively on the PS2, and this one just doesn't meet the same standards. The first katamari game was really fun and had about 20 different levels. The sequel, We Love Katamari, was great because it had lots of new types of levels with different scenery and concepts (underwater, at night, in the snow, etc.). This game, not only doesn't have many new concepts, it doesn't have many levels/places to roll. I finished it in about 6 hours and was pretty amazed that it was over so soon. In its favor, the music is good, there are a few decent levels, and the graphics are improved due to the Xbox 360 platform. Overall though, it's a disappointment."
4,"Exciting and fun, but kind of hard","I really enjoyed this Katamari game. It's pretty much the same as the other Katamaris but I think it may actually be just a little bit harder to accomplish the goals. They ask you to roll up katamaris but ask for certain kinds of items and sometimes your katamari is really big but you get a poor score because you did not collect enough of what they asked for. Also, they added MORE cousins! There is a new soundtrack but I didn't feel it was as good as previous ones. Overall, if you truly love Katamari, like I do, you will enjoy this game anyway."
1,Way too frustrating and hard to control,"Skip this one.1. To start each request (level) you have to press the A button about 20 times to get through pointless dialog. If you fail the level and want to try again you have to click 20 times through a ""punishment skit"". This is every time, on every level and there's no way to skip it.2. Controlling movement is very difficult and has left me sorry I trusted any of the reviews on Amazon. The automatic camera angles are equally bad.3. Most requests (levels) are timed. And the game doesn't give you enough time on the clock to perform the required task without a lot of effort. Young children will be super frustrated.4. The King who narrates the game is rather insulting which makes a difficult game even less appealing to play. He says things like you're a loser, you're mediocre, etc. Hard to believe this is a Japanese game."
4,Good Game,"Delivery took a little while with super saving shipping, but when it arrived it came wrapped in plastic in original box and with booklet and the game runs great with no visible marks."
2,overpriced and overhyped,"I liked the concept of the game. It is very unique. However, it made me very dizzy and nauseous. Also, I did not like how the movements in the game were so slow. It got boring real quick."
5,Amazing,"Like so many others we caught Classical Baby 2 on HBO with the DVR. It was incredible, it is the only thing that will keep our fussy 4 week old's attention for that long. The musical selection is great, the animation outstanding. We will certainly be purchasing the set."
5,Lost my original Classical Baby Music DVD and found this!,"My son loves to fall asleep to this DVD. When I lost the DVD, I was panicked! He was teething and was having a hard time sleeping at night, but the music on the Classical Baby: The Music Show gave him comfort before bedtime.When I found this three-pack of DVDs, I jumped right on this. It's a steal of a bargain, and the content on all three DVDs are perfect for teaching toddlers/young children about classical music, impressionist/post-impressionist artwork, and dance. My son loves to dance with the characters on the dance DVD, and the art DVD combines beautiful imagery, animation suited for grabbing a child's attention, and great music!"
5,My child really enjoyed this,"My 7 yo daughter really enjoyed this. I liked it as well, but I only have one complaint. The songs are abridged. Regardless, the fact that each 30 minute DVD is entertaining and keeps the kids attention with it's animations and highly entertaining animal audience is well worth buying this for the simple fact that it teaches an early appreciation for classical music. Most teens and adults would deem ""classical"" music as dull and tune it out, but this DVD series creates a positive association from an early age and may help them to give more varieties of music a chance in the future.The art and animation are simplistic and cute and at times funny. We enjoyed spending an afternoon together watching these DVDs!"
5,Agree with others!,"My daughter is 7 months old. I Tivoed this show when I saw it advertised. I watched it with daughter later and we LOVE IT! It is a part of our nightly routine before bed time.I have a 16 disc collection of Einstein videos, butthis is far better! The art is beautiful and the music is exceptional! Unlike Einstein, it is the real classics as opposed to the Music Box Orchestra.Each time I turn it on, my daughter focuses completely on it. It is one of the few things an adult and child can watch together and enjoy. I have pre-ordered the 3 disc set and can't wait till it is released.I see this as a must-have for families. Way to go HBO!!!"
5,Baby's Favorite Show,"We recorded this one day from HBO. It instantly calms my son and he really gets into the more lively songs, such as ""Mambo."" These have been wonderful for those times when your child is fussy, sick, etc. At 18 months, our son is now trying to get to the Tivo menu to play episodes, and has inadvertenly erased some. We'll probably make the investment into DVDs at some point. If you know anyone with a baby, this would be an outstanding gift."
5,VERY BEST SERIES FOR BABY!!!,"My daughter, Addison, has been watching the Classical Baby since she was 5 months old. I ran across it one day on HBO and immediately ordered the series for her. She loves all of the DVDs. We put in the Art Show at bed time. It is very relaxing for both of us. She loves all of the music and hums along with the tunes. She is now 13 months old and we still have not found any other series that she loves more. I highly suggest it to all. It is also wonderful to listen to the classical music rather than some hokey tune that you will be singing throughout the day."
5,classical baby -great for the whole family,these cd's are great to have playing while you are cooking or just relaxing with your little one. Music and artwork are lovely together. colors and drawings are choreographed so elegant and yet playful. must buy
5,Great entertainment for 1-2 years old baby girl.,"I was very skeptical before I purchased these CDs. But I found it is one of the best things that I have purchased for my daughter. The time when I brought it, she was about 1 years old and now she is about 2. She is still enjoying it. Whenever my wife and I want her to calm down or to cooperate with us, we said ""let's watch baby"" and she would be very happy to comply. We cut nails, feed her meals while she is watching The Baby. Watching the Baby has become one of the happiest time for her. Honestly speaking, I think the price tag is much lower than the value it brings. It is a bargain."
2,Doesn't live up to reviews,"I bought this for my 15 month old about 8 months ago. He isn't too interested in dvds as it is, but this one especially fails to hold his attention. The illustrations are almost infantile themselves and can be hard on the eyes, with their wiggling blurry outlines. I think my child just gets bombarded with confusing images and wants to look away. The only plus is that there is classical music playing, but I can play that for him any time with pandora."
5,Worth Every Cent,"This DVD set is the best money your can spend on entertaining your kids. I know 200 other have written the same thing, so I'll be brief. The music is really clear and well chosen. The art is very good and somewhat diverse. And my ballerinas love the dancing one most of all. Excellent, excellent product. I cannot recommend it any more highly."
3,Mum is more interested than baby,"A lovely DVD collection, well made etc but my daughter is not very interested in them.She's 14 months and hasnt watched any TV, just half a dozen DVDs. Most DVDs that we have bought have been an instant hit, this collection didnt have that effect.From my point of view - I enjoyed watching them, they were very calming :) But I think my daughters opinion is what is needed for this r/v."
5,Love these DVDs,I don't want to prop my kid up in front of TV but for those moments when you need something to occupy your child this video is perfect and educationally stimulating. These videos grab my daughter's attention. She is only 8 months old. She loves the music! Highly recommend. MUCH better than the Baby Einsteins. (I bought one to see if I like it.)
5,LOVE THESE!,"We bought these videos for our 16 month old daughter who LOVES music and she gets so excited when we watch them! We love the fact that they combine classical music with such interesting music, art and dance pieces and she loves the animals and seems to be enjoy the music as well. Highly recommend them to parents who want to bring classical music as well as some cultural elements into their home for their children."
5,This video understands children,"Most videos for children assume that they like manic sound and pictures, when really many kids find such stuff overwhelming. These DVDs are soothing and engaging. I absolutely recommend them -- as does my two year old!"
5,LOVE IT!!,I love this DVD set! I saw it on HBO once and I had to find the DVD set....My baby girl loves it!! If you want your child to know about classical music I would recommend this...
5,Better than Baby Einstein,"I first saw classical baby on HBO Family. My daughter (11 months)sat on my lap the entire time, with her eyes glued to the movie. We Dvr the show thank goodness, and ended up watching it every day. She loves it, and who wouldn't want their child to grow up knowing the Great Classics. I decided to buy the dvd, and I am glad I did. She absolutly loves the Mambo, and dances to it everytime she hears it. She loves all the animals. We have watched the baby einstein movies with her before, but she didn't seem interested. Her preference is definatly Classical Baby. Another plus is, they are inexpensive."
5,Love Classical Baby!,"I bought this after all the raves in the review, and boy am I glad of this purchase! My 15 month old son loves loves loves Music Show. I haven't shown him the Dance nor Art since I thought he might be too young for it still. My toddler is a very very active one and doesn't stay still for a minute, but when I turn this on, he'll watch the whole thing. It is quite amazing!! He'll clap with all the animal audience and will want a hug when he sees the ""Bear Hug"" segment. He will conduct with the conductor during ""Night Music"". It is such a joy to watch him watch this DVD.Also, my almost 5 year old twin nieces came over and enjoyed watching this with my son.I think each segment has the right amount of music so the babies/toddlers do not get bored with it. The animation is simple, yet very cute and captures my son's attention."
5,Love Classical Baby,"I've been watching Classical Baby on HBO during a preview and have fallen in love with it.Aside from the beautiful illustations with each segment, I really enjoy that they seem to tell a story (it isn't just flashing colors and lights).It will be nice once my child is old enough to encourage them to tell a story to match what is happening (such as the one where the Mommy and Baby hippo make lunch and do chores)."
5,Classical Baby 3,This is one of the best purchases I have made for my baby who is 7 months old!! He watches them at home and in the car. When he is upset or whiny these videos calm him right down. The videos are also calming for parents and siblings. Thanks Amazon and HBO for a great product!!Angela G.
5,Sweet & Inventive,"In a world where kids TV has gotten pretty wacky I am grateful for this set of sweet, simple DVDs that feature classical music and recreate well known works of art and choreographed dance.You can preview parts of this DVD on YouTube - which is where my then 3 month old son would first view these scenes. A favorite was ""Bear Hugs"" - where a mother/father polar bear and a baby polar bear play together in the snow. It is heartwarming and beautiful. Once we got the DVDs we were greeted with more gentle and unique scenes like ""Baby's Hands"" which shows a baby playing with toys from the baby's perspective.On Dance favorites are a recreation of ""West Side Story"" and ""Dancing Sheep to Sheep"". In Art you will be entertained by well-known works of art, it is exciting and beautiful.My son first received these DVDs when he was 5 months old, he is now 7 months old and enjoys them just as much as when they were new to him."
5,Great Entertainment!!,"We have bought this for all the little kids and their Grandma's, too! The programming is precious. It is a wonderful way to introduce your child to classical music without them even suspecting it! And the artwork and choreography are great!! The music selections are so suited to the programming--it all very beautiful. (I play it when there are no kids around--it's that good!)Thank you Amy Katz and HBO Family!!!"
5,Fantastic!,"I came across Classical Baby on HBO On Demand, and my two year old LOVES it - we watch it at night before bedtime, and he knows when the baby crawls to his mom at the end and they play Brahm's Lullaby over the credits, that it's night-night time (the baby even says 'goodnight' at the end). It's very relaxing, and he loves to hum along with the music - he especially loves ""Baby's Hands"", and sits there and waves his hands...the only drawback like someone said earlier is that the Art, Dance and Music are rehashings of the original Classical Baby 1 & 2...other than that, it's great, and I'll definitely be ordering the DVD."
5,We've worn groves in the dvds,It started with the Classical Baby Music dvd. My 23 month old daughter LOVED it! We added the collection to see what else was offered. And now we watch them over and over and over again. The good thing about the 3-pack is the music is enjoyable and the videos are atleast somewhat entertaining. All three have different animations and different music.It beats the big purple dinosaur!
2,Disappointed,"Each DVD is very short and fails to capture my child's attention. It just doesn't engage him. I don't get it. He enjoys the Baby Einstein series. It must be a live action versus animation thing. Regardless, I think there's better out there if you want to expose your kids to classical music."
2,Don't rely on colors in images,"I purchased 5 hats in 5 different colors & 3 of them were not even close to the color shown on the site. Otherwise, they seem to be of decent quality."
1,basic oxyacetylene,the price was outrageous for what this litle book had to offer. Was deeply disappointed in it.
5,He doesn't come with oatmeal!!!!!!!!!,"He comes with a bowl of chowder. If you remember the episode in which we meet him, he taunts a french waiter on how to say chowder. Hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Feels like towel,"The product looks exactly like Amazon's pictures. It arrived and was shipped quickly. No color bleeds after a few wash in cold water.One complaint I have is the shipping cost is high for something that weighs about 3 ounces. I think seller shifts product cost to shipping cost maybe to minimize discounts because I ordered this on a holiday and seller had a 10% off promotion, guess how much I saved--not much.Overall, 3.5 stars rounding up."
5,OUt of print CD,Not available on iTunes either. I've wanted this CD for a long time and finally found it at a great price. Powerful African music is catchy but relaxing.
4,Wonderful Music,"Wonderful music, and the only place I found to get the music of Bulawayo Church Choir. Enjoy!"
5,I May Have Mentioned it Before....,"But almost 10 years later...and i can listen to this whole cd, from beginning to end-and absolutley love it still!!! It is heartwrenching, heartlifting adn it will bring tears to your eyes but much love for your fellow man.It is a wonderful introduction to the music of South Africa as well..."
4,95% wonderful,"This album is as wonderful as all the other reviews say it is. The one drawback is the Power of One theme in the middle -- it goes from amazing African music to cheesy early '90s quasi-rock. The difference between this song and the rest of the album is similar to the difference between the book (a work of genius) and the movie (a mildly entertaining copy that fails to capture the magic of the book). If it bugs you as much as it does me, just buy the CD and make a copy (for your own personal use of course!) without that theme. It fixes the problem perfectly!"
3,heavier than expected,"These headbands are thicker and heavier than expected. Even though it's terry cloth, I feel like they are made more for keeping the ears warm than they are for keeping sweat out of the face. I would also prefer them to be slightly tighter (or maybe I have a smaller head?!). Sweat still has a tendency to get through and trickle down. I feel that if they were tighter that would not happen. Overall, they are of good quality and a good price and mostly gets the job done."
2,Just OK,I find these headbands a bit larger than I expected and they don't really help keep much of the sweat out. I will try a different brand next time.
1,where are they?,Tried to ask questions about product... customer support phone number always busy... web site can't be reached. Where are they? Still in business?
1,Do not buy!,I bought this program and was very excited to use it on my mac........... In the first day at least 10 times in the middle of a project it would shut down(error msg) what a waste I even attempted to re-instal it with no change!!!!
1,Not for Mac owners with Mac OS X Version 10.5,"Please heed the warnings about this product. Tech support reports that it is not compatible with Leopard (Mac OS X Version 10.5) and other than providing this information, they will not help or support Leopard users who had the misfortune to purchase this product. Tech support will not treat you like a client or customer, despite your purchase; they will simply tell you it won't work."
1,Not Mac compatible,"This product claims that it is compatible with Mac's but in fact, if you are running Leopard on your Mac it is not compatible. I did not realize this until after purchasing and installing the product and talked to three different tech support agents. After all the time and problems, they would not let me return the product. I would never purchase anything in the future from this company. They were not at all easy to deal with. There were problems right from the time of purchase and they were not willing to help. The product did not even arrive until over a month from date of purchase."
2,Moderately good desktop publishing software,"This product has drawbacks, especially for one accustomed to using more sophisticated page layout software. It is adequate for simple projects, but not for newsletters or other complicated layouts. Its word processing capability is particularly frustrating. I use it primarily for making greeting cards, labels, letterheads, and, as I said, simple layouts."
4,great,I really love the product. I just wish you could see the templates before clicking to finish. Also I wish there would be better sub catergorations.
5,No problems with Leopard (10.5),"This is a great product. Despite others reporting that it is not Leopard compatible, we have not experienced any problems at all with running Print Explosion Deluxe 3.0 on Mac OS X Leopard. If you're having issues, you might want to try the 3.0.2.8 update [...]. It was released in 2006, probably to better support Tiger (10.4), but it most likely would help Leopard compatibility as well.For us, even without the update, we really enjoy the program."
5,Very happy,Great product. made so many things for my sons Confirmation Party. couldn't of did it with out it....ANd amazon to shop is the best!
3,"Print Explosion - Good, but not as good as Print Artist","It's a good program that's versatile and basically easy to use, once you get the hang of it. However, I'm still waiting for a Mac version of Print Artist for the Op System X+ The original Print Artist program was superb!Others have the tried Platinum version of Print Artist but it doesn't work well with the newest Macs.Print Artist 4.0 Version PLATINUM"
4,Good Card program,For a program of this type this is excellent. I use it quite often with my Mac. computer. Don't know how it works with Windows but is easy to use and has quite a lot of graphics.
1,GREATLY DISAPPOINTED,"I thought I was upgrading products from the Print Shop. Maybe I just haven't learned how to use the program, but it has been EXTREMELY frustrating. I am going back to Print Shop."
5,So easy!,"I love this software. I loaded it and used it without any problems, no need to read directions. Super intuitive. I could make it the way I wanted instead of being tied to some rigid format. I love it. I have to say that I get easily frustrated so that I found this to be hassle free is meaningful."
1,Hands down worst program/support I have ever had!,"I bought this program because of the great reviews I read on Amazon. I have been sorely disappointed. Some of the major issues are that it freezes my Mac (that is well above the system requirements for the software), has a fatal error and shuts down every time I use the program, and none of the templates do what they claim they will do. Other issues are that when printing an image, many times it will print the image on six different pages even though it shows in the print preview it will print on one page. I have tried dealing with the support and the response (when I finally get one) is that it should work. They have no idea how to help me other than to say delete the program and reload it. They said they would look into it, but that was 5 months ago and I'm still waiting. I would recommend you not waste your money."
3,Greeting Cards & Certificates,Intending to use Print Explosion mostly for greeting cards and certificates I am not too happy with it. I've still not figured out how to do a conventional four-fold greeting card. There are not enough PLAIN certificate templates to design a sophisticated award certificate.
2,BUGGY AND AMATURISH,THIS product is CONSTANTLY CRASHING!!!!!! There maybe a ton of graphics but you cannot search to find what you need based on keywords. You have to scroll through tons of art and hope you find what you are looking for. IF they have a graphic that fits your theme chances are it will look like clip art from 1988. I was hoping for updates with access to better art and the ability to search on keywords.
2,wast of money,I bought to help make holiday cards and photo calendars for my family. The clip art is real bad and the size you tell the software you want the project to be never agrees with the preview and printable that comes out. Save your money and find a software that really does what it says it will.
3,It's all about templates..,"This is all about using the existing templates to drop your art or info into. The art supplied is not so hot and some of the templates supplied, like those for T-shirts, show a lack of understanding what the templates are actually for. But if you are in a hurry to produce something this may be your tool."
1,I'm Sorry I Bought This,"This should be called ""Print Disappointment"". It's buggy, some of the really cool features, like color gradations on a shape, don't work. You can't open networked files. The clipart is amateurish. There is a very limited colorset. I asked tech support about that and they said it can't be expected to provide the same features as professional software. Well, I've been using Printmaster on a PC for 8 years, it cost $20, and the earliest version I used worked better than this product."
2,Buy Print Shop 2 for Mac instead,"I had always used Print Shop on Windows but when I switched to imac I purchased Print Explosion. Sorry mistake. The program has 1000's of graphics but it's almost impossible to find what you want as there is no ""Search"" feature. The graphics are also very juvenille in appearance. I called Nova to verify this and he confirmed a simple search feature was not added. I continued to use the program anyway but found it was constantly shutting down, losing all my work. I finally reverted to saving every click. This was the last straw so I contacted Nova again and asked for a refund. They were very helpful and I got my refund in about 5 weeks after I mailed back the software. With my money I'm buying Print Shop for Mac."
1,The worst greeting card program I've ever used,"I bought this because I wanted a program to make greeting cards and such on my Mac. This was all I could find. It is terrible! It constantly crashes in the middle of designing a project. The graphics are very elementary and there is no way to search for a particular graphic. Browsing through the cards is also a difficult process. It doesn't allow you to see the inside of a card without choosing it for your project. If you decide you don't like it, you have to restart the entire process for creating a greeting card. Lastly, I spent 30 minutes creating a card that imported some of my own pictures. Everything was perfect on the screen, but when I previewed it for printing, it had substituted random parts of the pictures to display. I've used many greeting card programs, including American Greetings Creatacard, Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe, and Print Shop, and this is by far the worst program I have ever used."
1,maddening,"new to mac, but not new to making cards, banners etc, this program is just annoying, has a mind of it own, often shuts down right when I'm ready to print, or will close in the middle of a project, losing everything I've put into it. I'm so grateful I still have my hp and all the software that I had for it to rely on, for this program really does stink. If anyone knows of a program that their thrilled with to make cards and calendars and banners with on a mac, if you would post would love to hear about it. If my vote counts, I say save your money...and also watch out if you try and order the new hallmark for mac, they just charged me 3 times and came back each time saying my info wasn't good which I know it is, so now I get to dispute 3 charges...I'm just saying, looks cool, but I wouldn't give them your info online. Peace"
1,No Longer Supported,"I have had this application for many years, and it has served me well. But now it is quite buggy, and is no longer supported by Nova Development or anyone else. I recommend that you not purchase this software."
4,Great Segue from Print Artist PC to Mac Print Explosion,"After dumping my PC habit of 12 years for a MAC this year, the only frustration I found was the lack of a quick and easy art/clipart program for the MAC. Print Explosion was the perfect segue for me from Print Artist, which I had used extensively for cards, product inserts, banners, signs and other miscellaneous artistic needs. Made by the same company, Print Explosion is as intuitive as the MAC itself, and works seamlessly with iPhoto. It froze up a couple of times the first week of use, but has been error free since, and I have been using it about a month. A very good value for the money. It also provides more fonts than iLife. But still lacks Tempus Sans, which was my favorite PC font. Ah well.....Mac is so far above PC in every other area, I can't complain."
3,A Bit Disappointed.,"I was looking for graphics to equal the graphics on Printmaster. Alas, most of the graphics have an almost comic-strip simplicity. Also, there is no search option, where you can ask for certain graphics. The graphics are sorted into different groups, but you have to manually search through each group."
2,Print Explosion Deluxe,This was a disappointment! I am making this work but I so miss Microsoft PICTURE IT! 5 stars to Picture It and 1 to 2 stars for Print Explosion Deluxe.
1,Program is terrible,"Each time I try to create a project (greeting card, flyer, etc.), the program crashes every few mins. I tried to save as I went along, but it's tedious to reopen my project after numerous crashes.I am very frustrated with this program. The company needs to pull it from the shelves and fix all the kinks."
3,Could be better!,"We have only used it a short while but find that while many of the template cards are good, some are missed programmed. A sympathy card (cover) had a thank you verse on the inside. Found that type of problem more than once in just a short time. Reviewing templates is time consuming. When opening a template to review, then closing, you need to go to drop down file and open templates again. Cannot go back to template list, at least I haven't found the easy way yet. Editing is kind off tricky, but OK when you figure out the steps. I plan to point out these problems to Nova Development Corp. After saying all that, it's nice to have something Mac compatible."
1,Unstable for Macbook,"I do not recommend for Mac users. I have been using Print Explosion Deluxe for a couple of years now and am ready to give up and move on to a publishing program that is less frustrating to use on my Macbook. It is reliably unstable! The trick to using Print Explosion Deluxe on a Mac is to constantly hit SAVE because it will crash, thus anything not created within the past few seconds is gone and will have to be recreated again and again and again and again. What should take only a few fun and enjoyable minutes to create, will actually require a hours of teeth-clinching tenacity."
4,Cute movie for young children,"I grew up off of the Dot films when I was a kid, and now that I am slowly finding them on DVD, my children love these films. They teach about friendship, kindness, and good values."
5,Gorgeous treehouses,"A lovely book. Beautiful treehouses, beautifully photographed. A coffee table book, you should look to it for design ideas, rather than step-by-step howtos. Makes me eager to build me a treehouse of my own."
4,fun and inspiring,"This book was borrowed from a friend on a lark. A treehouse book for adults? What could I possibly learn? Answer: LOTS. The folks involved in developing and promoting the modern treehouse have taken the art to new heights and they lay it all out for you in this terrific, picture heavy book. Or almost. I do wish there were more photos of the construction process so one could see each project in various states of completion. Nonetheless, it's a whirlwind tour and will leave you yearning for more. Dare I hope for a DVD with future versions of the book? 360 degree views, interior and exterior would be wonderful. Yes, yes, easy to ask for the moon, but once you awaken the excited kid in me, what can you expect?"
5,Ultimate Treehouses,Looking at this book is perfect for day dreamers like me. It shows the most amazing possibilities for many types of treehouses. I haven't gotten to the point of reading the practical information but it is there for when I need it.
4,Treehouses aren't just for kids!,"Loved this book, very well done. Many great ideas and design concepts. I bought another one for a friend in the construction business!"
4,Bill Clinton Meets the Shrinks,"An objective and well-researched psychoanalysis of Bill Clinton. I appreciated Lowinger's clear explanations of psychoanalytical jargon, which made the book accessible and lively.While experts may not agree with all of Lowinger's conclusions, I think he presents well-reasoned, believable arguments about Bill Clinton's psyche based on publicly available information and his own expertise as a psychoanalyst.I assume author and subject have never met and that Lowinger has made some assumptions that cannot be proved. But I think he makes this clear throughout, often using words like ""may"" and ""points to"" rather than flat assertions.In this enjoyable and fascinating portrayal, Clinton comes across as an Everyman who still struggles to overcome the deficits of his early life, yet one who has achieved a great deal in spite of his difficulties and demons."
4,The Clintons Meet Freud,"Paul Lowinger is a physician, author, teacher and an extraordinary psychiatrist. (He taught me all that I know about psychiatry). His training is a rare combination of psychoanalysis with an eclectic and humane focus. In this book, Dr. Lowinger examines in great detail the events in the lives of the three Clintons - Chelsea, Hillary and Bill, and interprets these in the light of psychoanalytic principles - a sort of 'psychopathology of everyday life'. The result is a richly erudite psychohistory of this important family, flavored with gentle touches of humor. I like the book very much because it bustles with objectivity, relieving the reader of any tendency to allow preconceived biases to color their reading enjoyment."
1,"misleading: advertisements, brought as (little) info","I know it's just a tiny booklet, but I have found the title distinctly misleading, and would never recommend it to anyone who is really interested in getting to know even a little bit more about multimedia. There are hardly any 'essentials' in this booklet, and the 'tips' seem to refer more to what the highlighted manufacturers must be providing to the publisher for zooming in on their various products. There is no more info on multimedia to be found in these pages than on the boxes and wrappings of the products themselves, and so you're better off just having a look in a store, where you can at least make your own picks."
4,Great book,Excellent exercises book. With a lot of scales exercises to improve your precise and speed. Book a reading and understanding and good teaching.
3,Bass exercise,I like the book it help me with the use of my pinkie finger and keep my hand close to the fret board.
2,It's nothing amazing,"Any musician with any wits about them could come up with these exercises. I used the exercises daily BEFORE I bought the book. The exercises are good, don't get me wrong but it's really not worth the cash."
2,IT SEEMED MORE TANTALIZING .......,"I WAS QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THE BOOK, BUT ONCE I STARTED READING IT THERE WAS SOMETHING MISSING! IT WAS MORE ANECTODAL THAN ANYTHING ELSE. PERHAPS I WAS EXPECTING A CLEAN , WELL ORGANIZED GUIDELINE FOR USING HOME REMEDIES TO PREVENT/SLOW AGING!!"
3,book review,"Interesting book with a lot of recipes to try. I don't know if they really work, but they're easy and cost less that what's on the cosmetic shelves."
1,Nothing I haven't heard/read before,"I am extremely disappointed. I was expecting new, fresh, exotic ideas of skin care from around the world. Having read it cover to cover, I don't think I found one idea that I haven't heard/read before. Further, Shalini (the author) mentions her skin care line throughout the book, therefore, I can only surmise that the intention is to further publicize her online products. I'd like my money back!"
5,"This book is passport portable and PACKED with tips on being your best, gorgeous self!","I love it, there is something in here for EVERYONE, especially if you are the natural type of woman that isn't stupid enough to spends hundreds of dollars on products in Sephora instead of lovingly making them with your own hands with essentials found right in your kitchen!With tips and treats from all over the world, and a fun and easy-to-read style, you can use this book to treat yourself like the queen you are and share it with your loved ones as well. GET IT!"
5,Timeless advice,"This must be the 10th copy I purchased for friends,etc. as even though it is designed for teens, the advice will fit eight to eighty!"
2,Where are the gay teens?,It is very disappointing that there appears to no reference made to homosexuality in this book. A major flaw.
2,"GREAT, BUUUUT","I'm a mom writing this; not a teen. This is great book and it covers a lot of good topics. Be forewarned, it tells your teen exactly how to use condoms, exactly how to do everything the best way. It covers a lot of STD transmission which is outstanding but then it tells teens how much ___play to do be4 having sex. I think the book goes too far thus discounting its other highly good advice. I don't feel comfortable giving this entire book to my 15 year old. I'm not ready for my teen to have a through explaination of orgasms. So read it before you hand it over!"
1,Not what I ordered-waste of money,I ordered 3 pounds of Jelly Belly Valentines day mix and paid $40.00. WHAT I GOT WAS NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED OR DESCRIBED. I GOT MINATURE SURGAR COATED TINY JELLY LOOKING HEARTS STUFFED IN TWO BAGS.VERY DISAPPOINTED..Dont waste your money......... Jody Burnett
5,LOVE IT,"As someone who has always loved Audi TT's, I love this. It looks beautiful, feels well made and sturdy, and is just fun to have and look at. I wish it came in more/different colors so I could buy more of them!"
4,SILK AS DRINKING MILK!,Loose Control is undoubtly the one you need to relax with the lady you love always and forever! A must in in your deep stowage for bubble baths!
3,Left Me Hanging A Bit!,"Silk's debut album ""Lose Control"" is okay. To me, it seems as if some of the songs seems like filler, and it's impossible to have songs that sound like filler material for an album as short as it is! Keith Sweat is one of the best songwriters around and he blessed ""Freak Me"" with his skills. It became Silk's first, and one and only #1 hit in 1993. Other good songs on this album include: ""Happy Days"", which features Keith Sweat, ""It Had To Be You"", and the title track ""Lose Control""."
5,"I Love this book, a must- buy for any lover of music","I think that this book was very well written and focused very well on how the music of the Black community was a reflection of the status of blacks as well as their position. As a former student of Dr. Neal, I have learned that resistance to oppression does not always come from marches and sit-ins, but music itself can be a form of social protest. If you are a student of African-American history, you must have this book for your collection. Buy it now!"
5,Boretastic!,"Every ounce of this recording is enjoyable, uplifting, and cathartic, particularly if you happen to be a fan of both UNKLE and Boredoms. This may be my favorite of the Rebore comps (or perhaps it's a tie with eYe's Volume 0: Vision Recreation mix), and is certainly the most listenable overall. Some Boredoms purists are troubled by the sample of Mike D spelling out ""UNKLE"" that is sprinkled throughout the mix, but that's a bit like being upset that there is both peanut butter AND chocolate in a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Personally, I think it's pretty clever, considering that UNKLE also incorporates numerous samples of ""B-O-R-E"" from throughout the Boredoms' catalog over the course of this mix. It's also fitting, considering the occasional use of samples in Boredoms' own back catalog (""52 Boredom (Club Mix)"" anyone?) Overall, if you have an ear for amazing experimental music, this mix ought to tickle your fancy, and if you don't, it won't."
4,The Electric Interurban Railways in America.,"This book is almost overwhelming in in the detail. Still, that is of value to the student of this fascinating era. The book was written in the 1960's but as almost all of the interurban s were closed by the 1930's, the book is well worth having. I ""would"" have given it five stars, had the maps been reproduced in a style that better illustrates the overall interurban system."
4,sound nutritional advice,"I thought the information was excellent about diet and exercise. The DVD was enjoyable to watch as well. Gary seems to be a staunch health nut however if we all could just use a 1/4 of what he suggests, we could improve our health."
4,Ok...,"More like a 3.5 for me. These look very nice and fit well (true to size), however, I have a couple of issues with them. I was disappointed that these boots don't keep my feet as warm as I'd hoped (wore thicker socks, but feet still got cold). Also, these have developed a rather annoying squeak when I walk. I haven't experienced these issues with other boots I've purchased (not same brand), so overall, these are just ok."
1,Junk--Avoid,"What do you get when you mix numerous game-killing bugs, super-laggy multiplayer, pathetically amateur writing, stuttering graphics, some of the worst voiceovers in years, boring weapons, repetitive missions, and a bunch of ideas stolen from Halo? Breed, of course. What a bad joke of a game."
1,Terrible Game,"This game feels like some amateurs produced it. Takes forever to load, gameplay is awful. This is what makes people hate 1st person shooters. Your squadmates get killed for never moving, AI is stupid, aliens are dreadful. In sum, if you buy it, you will waste your money."
4,Delightful Book for Pottery and Related Banks.,"This 224 page book contains over 800 full color, sharp, large photos of pottery, porcelain and composition banks from 60 manufacturers. The banks are grouped by maker, ranging from Adria Art, American Bisque and Applause, to McCoy Pottery, Regal China and Royal Copley, to United Feature Syndicate, Walt Disney and Warner Brothers. Prices are updated to 1998. It is completely indexed to facilitate locating items. A useful guide for collectors of these items."
2,do not get this guide. no details,"After using several Lonely Planet books, I was thoroughly disappointed with this guide. The guide stuffs Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland with the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Do that many people hit Greenland and the main Scandinavian countries in the same trip to justify putting it in the same book? The result is that the book is short on detail, even the basic ""Things to Do"" that you can find in a competing Scandinvian guide. The guide is about 1/3 the size of just the Finland book, but about the same price."
5,Great vocals with tasteful songwriting!,"This CD is exactly what I look for in a new artist. Thoughtful and meaningful lyrics do these excellent songs justice. The best way to describe Tim's sound is soulful acoustic pop. My favorite tracks include ""Blackbox"", ""Crooked Point Of View"", and the soothing ""Summertime"". The production and sound quality of this disk is top-notch! Way better than I expected from an artist with no big record company budget behind it. ""Telescope"" is an exception to an industry plagued with one hit wonders and half-hearted songwriting. Tim Acres is sure to be around for awhile and I look forward to hearing more from this talented artist."
4,Superb History of the man behind the Business of Earnhardt,"Reading this book dosen't take very long (it's only about 250 pages), but what you will find inside those limited pages is truly inspirational. Don Hawk came from extrememly humble beginings and is now in charge of the business career of the most successful race car driver of the last 30 years. Reading this book will show you that he has most definately lost that humility. I was a bit disappointed in the details of the deal that brought Hawk to Earnhardt Inc., but the events that lead him up to that point more than make up for it. It will truly touch your heart to see what Hawk went through just months before joining Earnhardt. This is a must for every Earnhardt and racing fan. It truly shows the heart behind the engines of NASCAR."
4,You'll need an iron,"The included directions don't do the process justice. Check the web for 'Tube' videos of how to actually replace the headliner for your car. The fabric will be very wrinkled out of the package. You will need to steam iron it for an hour or so to remove the wrinkles. Use the lowest setting so you don't melt the foam backing.The fabric is a good color, plenty of extra given for a 4 door sedan, and the entire project took me approximately one day. Save $400 bucks though.. so well worth it."
5,"Good quality, easy to install.","I used this product to replace my headliner just yesterday. It's a good quality replacement, if you do it properly. One mistake I made is after applying the adhesive to both surfaces, I pressed down on the headliner just a little too hard, leaving depressions where the foam backing compressed. So take care NOT to use too much pressure when applying the headliner to the backing. But none if this is the fault of the product, which is an excellent value."
3,OK product,"It seems sturdy, but was too short for a Jeep Cherokee, not a lil short but alot short!!! I am sure not ordering another to cover the last 12 inches, I will use some other type of cheap material. This is my sons car. Easy to replace and install, I read a review that said it took a couple 20 minutes total, try 2 hrs total!! It came kinda wrinkled up, there are some spots impossible to get the wrikles out of. But for 50$ He won't have old liner hanging down with pins in it and glue dust flying around."
4,Solid Set,"Great playing from Zoot, in the prime of his career. The best sone is a wonderfully warm soprano sax rendition of Softly as in a Morning Sunrise. The CD features great tenor and soprano playing on a wide variety of tunes.The bonus tracks are 5 alternate takes that add over 25 minutes to the original recording.This is a great set for fans of Zoot's playing."
5,Amazing Soprano Work,"I am a huge Zoot fan, and his playing here is as good as on his tenor. Rosemary's Baby is one of the best Soprano sax solos ever, every note is placed at the exact right place, his timing as always impecable."
4,Interesting second tier game,"Not the best of the Days of Wonders games but made to their high materials standards and a respectable later addition to the game library. Game play is fairly fast and the concept of trading off short cuts that involve poor quality materials and workmanship is interesting. Players are trying to be the second most corrupt builder in the game (the first gets thrown to the crocodiles) which is an interesting game dynamic. The games are less than an hour once you know the system.Overall, it's a fun game but one that does not stand out compared to ""Ticket to Ride"" or ""Small World"", also by the same company."
5,Door stops,"I couldn't find ""reasonably priced"" door stops locally. I ordered these and they were perfect. I would definitely use this supplier again."
1,Purchased...,"and immediately returned it. After reading other commentators reviews and looking it over myself, I was dismayed. I live in South Korea, and the employee at the bookstore in Itaewon asked me why I'm returning it and saw it herself. She said she should have looked at it before selling it. She was amazed that there was no Hangul. How in the world can you not have its script included in the book? I don't care what any linguist says, it's necessary to the language, especially as it is a part of its history. I give this book two big thumbs down as it tricked me into purchasing a ""complete"" guide. I'm glad I was able to return this book immediately, and get my money back, but I'm saddened that such a big book didn't deliver as promised. I'm hopeful they read our reviews, and make a better edition."
3,What? Me no Hangul?,"I haven't read the book. I scanned the index and realize, with the other two reviewers, that the writer missed the boat by not using Hangul and, where appropriate, Chinese characters. Who is it that will have the interest and background to digest what this book has to offer who does not also know Hangul at a minimum?! One reviewer points out that romanization is useful for some purposes. Then put the romanized in parentheses or footnotes if and when it makes sense to use it at all."
4,This book needs hangul.,"The previous review is quite correct about the lack of Hangul in this book. More Chinese characters would also be nice. It is, however, helpful to explore the Yale system used by Martin if you want to read certain kinds of linguistics articles on Korean."
5,Good for the price,I used this with my sewing machine for real leather sewing and worked just fine. The price and packaging is good too.
2,Family Nursing,This book was advertized as being in Very Good condition and should have been Good condition. It actually had lots of highlighting and writing throughout the book. Edges were worn and the cover was torn. It also was very slow in arriving. I was disappointed. The book itself served its purpose for college class.
1,Drink More Coffee!,"I am a fourth year BSN student. This book was our assigned text for our family class. I felt the book was to wordy on explanations. Points were not clearly established. They were merely tossed around comparing and contrasting one research study versus another. I would get so lost in the theoretical views from numerous positions that I would literally fall asleep reading this book. Surely, there is a more palatable undergraduate book on family theory?"
3,Book review,"Description stated that book was used but good condition. The book was very used, many rumpled pages and the cover is almost falling off. It is still usable but a more specific description of the condiiton of the book would have been helpful. Otherwise the book came on time, no other issues."
5,Better than expected,"I didn't expect this product to be super quality since it's so in-expensive, but it arrived yesterday and looks great. I'm very impressed. It seems to be of quality construction and is exactly the look I was going for on my truck. We'll see how it holds up on the road but, at this price, even if it only lasts a year or so it's easily replaceable. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple frame with some quality artwork (the skull looks awesome.) It's much, much better in person. The picture definitely doesn't do it justice."
4,"Easy to Install, Looks Great",I didn't encounter any issues trying to screw this cabinet into the studs. The directions were straightforward and applicable and the cabinet looks great. The recessed fit is very clean and works great in the tight little room I have it in. I've also installed one similar to this one as a replacement for an old medicine cabinet. Very happy with both units.
2,What's Wrong With These People?,"OK, so they take all the time in the world to design a cabinet that fits between studs, and then they include THE CHEAPEST SCREWS IN THE WORLD that strip and bend when trying to drive them into framing studs.Turned a 1-hour job into a couple of days!I should have probably rated this one star. I paid $50 for this."
3,3 Bad ones,I am on the third TV now and just called Lilliput and they ar going to replace it agian this time I don't have to pay to ship it back THEY ARE. I just hope the next one works right because it has a great picture a lots of extra's.I use it here at the computer desk to watch TV and two securty camera's.First one had almost no sound and a bad ear phone jack. Secound one The Color went out.Third one you could not stop sound It would go all the way up or down with stoping when useing remote control than last night the remote stoped working all toghter.
1,Not worth it,"This is a 2 DVD (Nick Warren Mix; Saeed and Palash Mix + interviews) + 1 CD set (same Nick Warren mix than the 1st DVD): by the way, in my DVD the CD side was not detected even though i could hear it on my CD player. Well, the review: I spent like 2 months waiting to find this DVD, and when i finally got it......it was a big dissapointment!. Yes, Nick Warren is one of my favorite DJ's, but this DVD is his worst work. Maybe the mix is ""not that bad"" (Personally, i think that the one from Saeed and Palash is better). From what i think they had better released it as normal audio CD's as the images have no quality (looks like a home video of a discoteque with some poor computer graphics and some landscapes of Ibiza, with not a good edition, very very poor images), and also the interviews with Sasha and Tenaglia..well, i think that a 2 minutes segment in Entertainment Tonight is better."
2,The Bouncer,"First of all, i think The Bouncer was Overhyped. Reading all the bad and good reviews of this game i went ahead and bought it. It was very fun for the first week. Then the game just grew old. Sure it has exellent graphics and decent voice acting but the replay value and the gameplay was WAAAY off. Give it a ren't and make yourself a favor,don't buy it."
2,"Going, Gone!",I will start off by saying SHORT. 2 Hrs max. The concept of building up your characters is nice but not worth playing through 3 times to max them out. Also the Story lines for each character aren't worth playing them through either. When you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases. The graphics are nice which they should be. Expected more from Square but wait I usually do......and they usually don't.
2,There is no restart level in the ... game!,"While the FMV and the graphics look gorgeous, the game has a giant flaw that really detracts it from being a real top-shelf game: the load function ... If you fail a fight, then you have to restart..from the title screen. Then you need to reload your data, then if your scene is buried after a few cinematic cuts, you need to skip the scenes. This could have been avoided by having some sort of restart you could simply replay the fight scene. Oh no, instead I waste about 30seconds to cue myself back up to where I was before. The animation looks great, but the aggrevation from having to reload, made me glad that I rented, not bought this game. The gameplay got extremely tedious after awhile. Beat up guys, watch a cut scene, beat up more guys, more cut scenes....I suppose that part and parcel of the genre, but this game makes it seem so monotonous after a while. The cut scenes also break up the fluidity of the game play."
4,This game is SOOOO cool,This game is a really cool game. You get to go through the whole game as any one of the three characters. It gives you the chance to hear all of the character's thoughts and they all have their own unique style and attitude that they express when you choose them to go on a mission. The one and ONLY reason I give this a four star rating is because it can get kind of boring since all you can do is go through the same game over and over again. The multi player mode is great too. You can pick your three favorite characters (or the ones that have been powered up to the highest level through the one player game) to go against three other characters. It's really a great game.
2,Barely worth a rental!,"First of all- make sure you have Sony brand controllers or the game won't play! But once you get going, this ""action"" game is non-stop interruptions by short insignificant mini-movies that only slow the pace of the game. Plus the movies are filled with awful banter that puts you to sleep- at least there is an option to skip through them! Nice graphics and control, but the moves are pretty weak and your opponents are NO challenge. As for the fighting style: remember Final Fight? Same thing. Also, the camera angles leave you looking at your character in odd ways so you can't tell where you are going. All things being equal, this game is pretty boring."
2,The Bouncer,"The visuals are awesome but the gameplay lacks all the key elements that make a great game. Also this game is very short, like only 1hr and 33 minutes to complete short. I am very disappointed in Square. They have the reputation for producing top quality games for the PS1 but they lack a lot in cracking the PS2 code. Once again do not buy."
3,"Fun, but short","It's fun beating people and robots up, but there are only about ten different enemies total. Some of the bosses seemed hard to me, but I'm not used to this kind of game. Even though I was slow, it only took me a couple hours to beat this. I was surprised when it ended, because it was so short. Not much of a world to explore, either. Nice scenes and there are cool moves, but I don't know if you have time to learn them all. Read the manual, too. It gives no explanations in the game, although you'll still figure it out. This is definitely a game to rent and not buy, unless you can buy it for very cheap."
2,bouncer= streets of rage with too much down time,i love squaresoft and this is a good game but the fact of the matter is that you'll spend 1-5 minutes playing the game followed by 2-6 minutes of video and story developement. the actual gameplay is a little sluggish and a let down. on the upside the graphics are a squaresoft standard of quality. so if you don't mind getting into a game and taking breaks every few minutes to watch cutsceens you'll probably like this one.
1,WORST GAME EVER,"squaresoft needs to stick to rpgs only. All you do is watch a movies, fight for 2 minutes, then watch a movie again, and then 45 minutes later the game is over. And the fighting sucks too, you just mash buttons and get double teamed. And you fight with two other guys, and if they kill enemies while you are not in control of them you dont get any experience. This game could have been so good, the characters and graphics are beautiful, but it seemed like squaresoft decided that gameplay did not matter at all. They could not pay me to play this game ever again. Worst game I ever played."
2,lets watch the bouncer,"My friend and I rented this game over vacation, thinking that it would be great. The graphics looked cool and the story sounded interesting. Yes these were both true, but I think we got 30 minutes of game play througout the whole game. The rest were movies. So now jockingly we say to each other, hey lets go watch the bouncer. It is fun to watch, but I wish that there was more playing time."
2,"Rent it, beat it, take it back!","This game has some of the most beautiful graphics out there and I was very impressed. The Dreamcast doesn't have anything like this. This still however, is a horrible game that only lasts for a little over half an hour. When I first heard this I thought my friend meant short like Metal Gear Solid. In actuality he meant short like demo of MGS. The chance to play through as another character reveals nothing that is significant and you'll be glad that Blockbuster bought it instead of you. This game is another example of why I still spend more time playing my Dreamcast."
4,Great game in great condition,"I hadn't played this game in over six years and so I started looking for it again so that I could play again. The one I bought was used but according to the seller it was in good condition. Not only did it arrive within like 3 days, but the disk was in great condition. This is a great game and it was completely worth buying again"
2,"Fun, but not worth it!","I am glad that I rented this game to try it out first. It's pretty much just a 2 hour movie, and you get to play the fight scenes. You get to choose the point of view that you experience the adventure from - thus revealing hidden secrets of the three different characters. Graphics are wonderful, but long and drawn out. If you die during a fight, you have to skipthrough many movie scenes to get back to where you were. The plot is a bit predictable and overdramatic. Don't be fooled: this is not really a ""Role Playing Game,"" you have to actually fight in live action, but you gain levels and special abilities as you go along. Overall: a fun game, but it wasn't even worth renting because I rented it for five days and I beat it in one sitting."
4,"This would be great, but...","This is an excellent looking game, probably the best looking game on the PS2 right now. But there is one major flaw to this game, Its way to short! If you skip all the cinematics then you could probably beat it in less than an hour. But it has tons of replay value and the cinematics are unbelivable! If you like fighting games and good graphics buy this game."
2,Did not live up to the hype,"As many Squaresoft fans did, this past weekend I purchased The Bouncer.All the advertisements and previews made it sound like game of the year. However, it was just a mindless beat-em-up with an okay storyline. I beat the game in 2 hours, and in one day I unlocked all the secrets. No challenge here at all.It was visually stunning, the first game to really harness the PS2's power. But as an avid Final Fantasy fanatic, I thought the gameplay was a poor job by Squaresoft"
3,Excellent graphics...poor gameplay,"This game has one of the best looking graphics and is probably one of the today.But,something is missing. I beat the game in 4-5 hours to beat but,if you skip all the movie clips,you only have 40-45 minutes of gameplay and that sucks.Squaresoft is my favorite game company but,this game disappointed me and I think that they were in a rush to make the game and put it on the market of there first ps2 game on the system.So my advice is don't buy it and just rent it somewhere.Sorry!!!"

3,Great presentation,"Squaresoft is definitely one of the best when it comes to PSone. The Bouncer is their first PS2 game. The Bouncer is a adventure game / movie / fighting game combination with the best graphics and FMV I have seen in any PS2 game until now. It might be a bit short and it might be a bit lacking in gameplay, but if you want to see what the PS2 is up to you might want to get a copy of this game. It is not comparable to other Squaresoft games like the Final Fantasy series, Chrono Cross, Xenogears or Vagrant Story. Still buy this one, if you enjoy great graphics, music, movies and fighting games."
5,Square has done it again!,"Everyone knows SquareSoft as a RPG makers,But they tryed something different.They tryed a fighting/RPG type game.And it was a great thing they did:) :)"
1,The biggest waste of Money,"For all the hype, you would have hoped it would have come at least close to being fun. Instead I beat the game in under an hour, most of the hour I spent watching stupid cut scenes. I bought a game not a bad movie, I could have beat it using only one button too. I don't like spending $50 on something that doesn't even last an hour. The replay is horrible, you fight the same people, you just get to see a different charater say different lines. It was still the same story. And are you kidding me with the 2 player section. I can't believe I wasted the minute to even load it up. I should have saved my money, taken $2 and bought Double Dragon and watched a really bad guy saves girl movie inbetween boards. Squaresoft should appolagize for releasing a game so poorly written. I want my money back!!"
2,"Awesome Graphics, but too short and no storyline","This game sucks except the graphics are the best. Only buy this if you are into the graphics, however if you like the gameplay factor do not buy this and waste your money!!!!"
2,Boring...,"Good graphics, bad camera and boring fighting system make this game a real snooze-a-rama. This game is worse then the old arcade game, final fight. No weapons, no interactive backgrounds...even Gekido for PS1 has this."
1,"Too short, poor gameplay, terrible acting, dumb script...","I like fighting games, but this one is really bad. The many cut-scenes totally destroy the momentum of the game. The ""acting"" in those cut-scenes is soooooooooooooooo bad that it becomes funny (unintentionally, in a cult-movie sort of way)Worse: The fighting is slow and boring. The way the characters walk around is terrible. The AI is very dumb. There is no challenge whatsoever in this game: you don't need skill, you don't need wits, you just need patience to sit through this ordeal."
2,So So,"when i first got the game i thought that it would be okay. once i started to play it, i found it to be a little [too easy]. granted if you beat the game with one of the three different characters you get a different ending, but other then that the game has very little to offer. on the plus side there is a hot female villan with some real big ... that saved me from trashing the game."
2,The biggest letdown for years...,"It promised so much, they promised so much.. they forgot to tell us that they weren't going to deliver the goods.+ Great Graphics + Good Sound- Repetitive Gameplay - Shallow Storyline - Boring CharactersSimple summed up, I expected much better, the best game on the PS2.. but instead I get a boring, repetitive game that only lasts under 2hrs and I will probably never play again..."
1,Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom. . .,". . . and the Bouncer definitely hits bottom and not only does it not bounce, it then proceeds to tunnel through the earth and emerge in a strange and boring land. Instead of playing Bouncer, you might want to just hold your controller and watch cartoons -- you'll experience about the same amount of interaction but the stories and animation will be a lot better."
2,Rent this before you buy it.,"I thought that this game had great graphics and and controls were nice and easy, but the rest of the game stunk. The story is kinda stupid although it is cool that the story changes a little with each person. The camera angle in parts of the game are horrible, but worst of all is the fact that you can finish the game in an hour and a half or so. So if your thinking about buying it RENT IT FIRST."
2,"Looks great, but gameplay is poor!","OK, I agree. It LOOKS wonderful! But eye-candy isn't everything when it comes to great games. This is NOT a great game. This is an OK rental game, since it is easy to play. Re-play value stinks except to show your friends."
5,this game...... kicked a$$,"okay, it was short..... but it had the best graphics and fighting. it had multiplechoices for fighting. this is the kind of game i would expect from squaresoft."
5,Buy This Game! It Rocks!,This game is so sick! I love it! I recommend this game to anyone who loves fighting games or anyone who likes those games just to play when you're pissed off about something!...
3,ok,"Bouncer was hyped up to much and ended up to be a dissapointment for a lot of people... if you like games that are 85% of the time a movie then buys this, if you don't like that then don't buy it!!"
5,another get square soft game.,I hurd about this game from one of my friends. So when i went in to turn in my ps1 i got THE BOUNCER!!And let me tell you this game is so much funn the replay value is very high. The only problem is as you go it goes from incredably hard to childish easy.The video modes can and do get very boring. But you can skip though them!? And the vs mode is fun as well
3,an o.k. game,Let me start off by saying this games story in my opinion is kind of stupid. The graphics are great just like every other ps2 game but there's not to much to this game. I mean I understand that its a fighting game and all but all you do is fight. It loads up the next level and you beat up about five or six guys and then it loads up the next level. Meanwhile your character stats are increasing. The only real challenge I got was from the boss of the game Duragon and that was because he's cheap. The game did however have a pretty decent multiplayer mode. When my friends and I got together and played we had a lot of fun and that is why I gave it three stars instead of one. The fact that is extremely short doesn't help either. Personally I wouldn't reccomend buying this game with out first renting it.
2,Awsome look but game is very lacking,"The movies and grafics are very well done, and over all the game looks nice, but the down side is that the game leads you by the nose from fight to fight, showing you what you do, without any control of movement or even what you say. It is basically watch a clip, and then fight.The first time through you can beat the game in about 2 to 3 hours, and its faster if you go though a second time.Rent this game before you even think of buying it. Then when you beat it a few times, you can decide if you want it or not."
2,Thought it would be better...,I bought this game because I had heard it was good. Big mistake... The graphics are excellent. The story line is okay but seems to remind me of some OLD school games (like 3 guys going to look for the mayors' daughter). Alot of the other characters are faster and you don't even turn around in time to fight back. Although if you put together combinations they are pretty cool. Another draw back is you can't continue if you lose you have to go all the way to the beginning and reload. One thing I thought also to be funny is they way they are dressed... Who wears that kind of ensemble. Bottom line for all gamers. PLEASE RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!!!
1,Rent it first does not last long!,"This game has great graphics but it just does not last long enough! I beat the game in an hour and a half. The Battle royal mode is cool with friends. Overall, pretty average game"
3,Dont believe the hype,"The three stars I have given are only for those who like fighting games - and If you do then stick with DOA2, or Tekken because this game doesnt come close to the enjoyment of those games. The storyline is extremely rigid with absolutlety no opportunity of changing its course (sorry RPG fans - this ones not for you). On its plus side is of course the graphics - some of the cut scenes are breathtaking - but after you seen them youve seen them - watching cut scenes is not gameplay. If you take out the cut scenes the actual game time to complete the whole story mode is about 6 minutes.. fighting one thing then the next. Games saves are always positioned before the cut scenes, and it gets frustrating the amount of skipping/loading to get a rematch with the baddy that just finished you."
2,Lets see,"Well it does have good graphics and is fun, but story mode gets pretty easy if you have beaten it once or twice. It still is a good game if you like fighting games."
3,The Bouncer was good but it wasn't the best either.,"I was intrigued by the storyline of the game and the whole BP system. What dissapointed me the most was that the game was too short. It was like a cutoff storyline sequence. However, I enjoy storylines since i'm a major RP gamer. I've played the FF series, Chrono Trigger and Crono Cross, Tales Of Destiny and Parasite Eve 1 and 2. I expected The Bouncer to be a different yet stimulating game. However, I was dissapointed by that aspect of the game. The Bouncer's a lot more like Sega Saturn's Street Fighter, which I also played and enjoyed. Overall, the voices are well done and the grapics are utterly stunning. I would strongly recommend this to a Street Fighter lover but, not to a serious RPG gamer."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,ITs true that this is a great visual masterpiece but the game is only about 2 hours long and you have to beat it about 10 times to get all the secret characters who are useless anyway. Survival mode and vs mode are the biggest waster of time because each character have about 8 combos that you can do and all must be learned. After they are learned just pressing a button or two with L1 makes those combos come out. The games story is the worst. You will be bored with this game in three hours. Most enemies are only vunerable to one or two of those special combos so you are going to be doing the same thing over and over. The game also asks if you want to save almost every scene. If you buy this game you will regret it.
1,Square's worst game,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The Bouncer is nothing but a rental, so don't waste your money on it. Yes, The Bouncer is a beautiful game. These are simply the best graphics on any system. The animation is amazing as well. BUT...graphics don't mean anything in the long run -- it's all about gameplay. The Bouncer has the most boring, repetitive ""gameplay"" found in any fighting game. The story is a joke too, and we don't really care for these characters at all. If you like gorgeous cinemas, then The Bouncer is for you. It is one big long cut-scene with about fifteen minutes of actual gameplay thrown in. The Bouncer is a laughable, beautiful, pathetic mess. Square should be ashamed of themselves -- The Bouncer is easily the worst game they have ever made."
1,ONE WORD STINKS,one day i was flipping throught the pages of a game magazine adn i came upon a game called the bouncer. it looked cool and i thought iam going to get that game. time came when it came out and i saw it at a rental store. i grabbed it and couldnt wait to play it to beat up some bad guys. boy did i pick the worst game to rent. i beat the game in 1hour 30minutes about and the thirty is for gameplay and the hour is for the in game movies. i have never played in a game in my life that has so many movies in it in so little time. iam giving this game a one because of the best part of the game that is the graphics.
4,Excellent,"The game is one of the best PS2 game so far. SquareSoft has shown us how good they are in the computer animation. The graphic and sound are excellent. The story mode is actual an interactive movie and kind of short and easy. You have to go through the story mode in order to have all the scenes and characters for other modes anyway, so let enjoy the movie and practice the fighting skill. For the fighting part it is not as good as the real `Fighting' game (e.g. Tekken), but it is not bad. I have a feel that the future of Final Fantasy will be following this trend."
3,"Fun, but short","The graphics, controls, characters, sound effects, the whole plot and way of beating the game, and fighting all the people is excellent fun. The 2 stars missing are for me beating it in 3 hours(maybe 3 1/2). You cannot spend 50 bucks on a game and beat it in 3 hours and get you moneys worth of playing. You can keep improving the grade of your 3 guys and get them to and S grade, which adds on playing time, but is very boring. When you go through the second time, it is always the exact same thing, accept for a different path and story for each character.Overall, not worth [$] bucks to buy(not even close), but worth a [$] rental. I have to end this review by calling it a good game. THATS ALL I GOT TO SAY!!"
4,square,"like all squaresoft games, bouncer doesnt dissapoint, BUY this game if u want a interactive movie. Thats the reason i bought it, and it was well worth my money."
4,Very cool game,"A few months ago I rented this game. Squaresoft's first PS2 game not being an RPG, but a fighter? I thought that was kind of wierd. When I started playing it, and the cut-sceans started, it was obvious that the graphics were definaly some of the best I had ever seen. (That is, until Gran Turismo 3 came out.) Not only that, but smooth controls (analog sticks or directional buttons), and great sound. My only complaint is that it took me two hours to beat. But with four player matches, and unlockable characters, you'll never really get bored. This is a great game, that got a lot of awful reviews, but I think it's worth buying. You may want to rent it first though."
3,TOO SHORT!!!,I can beat this game in a half hour if I skip all of the movie parts and when you beat it you can play again but what fun is that cause your character stays strong and then you can beat it faster! Rent this but dont buy it its not worth it. Wait for Onimusha or Metal Gear 2 or Gran Turismo 3. Also when you die you cant get back intoo the action fast cause the menus sucks and makes you load your game too much instead of just put retry button.
2,.:Fun.. for about 20 mins..:.,Dont get me wrong.. I liked the game. It was decent. but.. worth buying? I don't think so. Rent it. save yourself some bucks. The game lasts about an hour... and nothing really happens. The CG graphics lack realistics as well.
4,good game,"This is a very nice game. The story mode is filled with excellent graphics. Though the story is short, it must be played multiple times to get the complete story. Also, after you finish the story mode, you can play against friends in the Versus mode. ...yeah..."
1,All that glitters ain't golden,"This game looks fantastic. It's visually stunning and works the PS2's capabilities to a great extent. The sound and cinematics are nice too....but that's about where the fun stops. This is a brawling game where you get to pick one of three fighters in single-player mode. The controls are limited and clumsy (but the buttons are pressure sensative, which is kind of cool). There's not much in the way of skill here...mash mash mash, you know?I was excited about this game, but got instantly bored when I played it for the first time. Thank goodness there's a return policy at Babbages.Don't buy this one. It's short and boring..and pretty slow. Not good for a fighter/brawler."
2,bouncer gets bounced,"this game is not worth paying for. i had more fun going to the dentist than playing this game. first of all, 75% of the game, you have to sit and watch the cinematics rather than playing. second of all, the gameplay was rather boring and repetitive."
2,Bouncer is a good rent.,It is a good fighting game but the game can be beaten in a matter of minutes. It took me about 30 minutes to have all my characters to max power and its not much fun after that. I recomend you rent it then see if it is worth the buy.
3,Decent game but short and too easy .,I bought it used a few months ago and think its a good game if you can get it cheap.... The game was ok I liked it for a while and after beating it several times It got kinda boring the best part is playing the multiplayer with friends every now and then...
4,Bounce youre way out of here,"I should start out with saying that this game is not a traditional game from Squaresoft, it is like a jazzed up version of Streets of Rage or something. It has many good things about it, and many bad things.First off, graphics are amazing, and dialog sounds different instead of having that robotic sound to it. By all means this is a great game, it's got story, it's pretty fun, and it has the hugest replay value of any game ever.However, the game is extremely short, about an hour or two, depending if you skip movies or not. And after beating the game a few times, the only fun thing to do is battle it out with a few of your freinds. I would like to have seen more RPG elements in this game, instead of movies then fighting.If you want to showoff your playstation 2, or you have some freinds to fight with, then this game is for you. However, if you are more of an RPG-er and not much for just battle games, then just rent the game first."
5,A MUST BUY GAME FOR PS2 OWNERS,"First I would like to say this is a great game. I personally do not think it's a short game. Maxing your stats, watching all the different endings, and unlocking all the hidden characters is a lot to do. The thing I really liked about this game was the graphics and sound. Wonderfully done special attacks, the enviroments was outstanding. The 5.1 surround sound implemented in the game was great, I was amazed especially in the first FMV. The thing I wish they had done was made the enviroments more interactive."
2,"Great graphics, poor play","I read the other reviews and I agree with them. It only took me about an hour to beat this game one time through. I was expecting something much much more. The movie sequences are great, as are the actual playing graphics, but too much time is wasted on the movies. Please rent this game before you purchase it (if you even do.)"
2,"Incredible Graffix, Boring Gameplay, and Too Short","this game had sick potential. when u first start to play it... u think it is totally sick, great graffix, incredible fmv's.. but as u get farther into the game, the gameplay gets too tedious.. like how many times can u possibly press ""punch, kick, punch, kick."" the boring fighting set up is often interrupted by beautiful movie sequences that gradually move the story along. after about an hour and a half of fighting many bad guys/bosses, and watchin the hundreds of movie sequences, the game is over. u will finish the game the 1st time u sit down to play it. SUMMARY: sick graffix, repetitive action, good movies, short game.. make this a 5 dollar rental from blockbuster.. cuz u can beat it in 1 night.. there also shoudl ahve been a more developed multiplayer aspect"
4,The bouncer has its ups and downs.,The game one of the most amazing graphics and movies I have ever seen. The Story isn't bad. One of the problems are that most of the game is movie. You don't get to fight that often though.But I would reccomend this game still since it's better than your average fighting game.
4,Exhibits some huge talent,"For years on end, Squaresoft has presented the video gaming world with the very most elite video games in the world, of which include the ever popular Final Fantasy Series. The Bouncer fits right in with it's other amazing titles. As the game says, the Bouncer is like a action movie you play. It is a movie, acutally, only you play the parts that have actual fighting. It is one of the most intriguing titles yet."
2,Medium security. Easy to defeat.,"Visually intimidating, but easy for a crook to open. The soft carriage bolts can be drilled out (three on just one side) or a hacksaw cut can be made down the right side (in the picture between the bolts and the semi-circular guard. Hardened carriage bolts seem to be unavailable. Just the incredibly soft imported junk. So the soft carriage bolts are pretty much just for show. If anyone knows of a supplier of hardened carriage bolts, please post here.Welding this to a metal door would make it much more resistant. So would drilling and tapping holes in the areas covered by the lock and bolting from the inside. Or countersinking the holes and using flat headed socket bolts with nuts on the inside. That way, drilling the carriage bolts or cutting the soft steel would not do the job. Adding these extra bolts is what I did."
1,What's the Point?,There was no hardware for mounting the hasp. What good is it without any means of attaching it to anything? Nor were there any instructions as to what type of hardware to use. Completely worthless.
3,shouldn't he have an M-60?,"Not really a fan of the Hall of Fame line. The scale is different from other 12"" Joes and the accessories aren't as detailed (or really compatible with other versions). I picked this up because it was cheap and my1992 G.I. Joe Basic Training Heavy Duty 12"" Action Figure Hall of Fame (A real American Hero)was getting lonely. The pluses on this were that it had flocked hair (something I haven't seen on Hall of Fame figures) that made it similar to an Adventure Team Air Adventurer and that there was nice detail on his uniform. The minuses? While detailed, the uniform bears no resemblance to the one I remember when Rock N Roll was first introduced in the early '80s. Also, instead of his M-60, he's armed with what looks like a chopped-down version of Jesse Ventura's minigun inPredator. If you want Rock N Roll armed properly, track down one of the Hall of Fame accessory sets that have an M-60. Fortunately, I had one."
2,Please do not buy this,2.5 OZ cup. It is very small. It can be only used as toy for my kid. There is absolutely no practical use of it. Please spend some 10$ more to buy a bigger size.
2,These are PINK,"These cups are packed nicely and good quality for the price, BUT they are not the color they appear to be. I thought they were browns/tans and bought them for my husband, but the are pinks -very feminine. I wouldn't even want to serve in them to a man!"
1,101 Ways to Boost Your Web Traffic,"I recently purchased 3 books through Amazon for the purpose of improving my web site traffic. I purchased this one based on the reviews I read here. Boy! did I get taken.This book has 10 chapters. Nine of them provide what I would call basic web site common sense and is oriented for an absolute beginner. The one chapter that has a bit of meat in it on how to modify your web pages to improve traffic just doesn't go into enough detail to be really worth while.If you want a good book, with a lot of meat in it, get ""Search Engine Optimization for Dummies."" You get a great deal of information right from the first page and plenty of advice on how to help you."
5,Great for Affiliates,101 Ways To Boost Your Traffic is packed full of ideas that can be used to build and site and marketing plan for a successful website. This book is great for the affiliate just starting out it covers everything from establishing an online presents to how to offer excellent online support and service. I would recommend this book to those just starting our or anyone who just want to make sure that they have all the bases covered.
1,"Wish I could say it's good, but I cannot","This book is full of obvious, outdated and sometimes poor advice. The title suggests it gives 101 ways to promote your site. Many of the 101 are really ways to avoid turning people away. For example, #11 is ""Beware of the Little Yellow Sign.""On the plus side, there are some good ideas in the book, it's just that your web promotion research dollars should probably be spent elsewhere. Certainly I would not purchase this as my only web promotion book (and fortunately I did not)."
3,Great Men at War,The Book just did not get me where it counts. Too many words with nothing said. I was surprised the writer wrote so much about the training which most of us know about anyway. I would probably not recommend this for an exciting read.
4,Fast moving adventure,"If you have ever wondered what goes on durring a seal mission, read this book! fast action and a real page turner!"
1,worst yet,"This product is not woman friendly. At the very least, it takes 2+ days to get it off your skin. It gave me the worst yeast infection both times I tried it....after that, I threw it away."
3,"Exciting and faithful, but parts are funny","This is a real exciting movie about some God fearing people who try to do God's work in the world. They can rebuild the Temple, but first they have to blow up the stuff that is there now and transfer the bad people. So they almost succeed!People who like ""Left Behind"" will like this, most of it.The only bad parts are the nice Rabbi's daughter, who is disobedient. She does all sorts of bad things. Some are really obscene! If it were not for her, we could have the Second Coming! It just goes to show you, how bad it is when people question their parents and even God's Word."
1,Political Agenda,I found the film very superficial. It was obvious that the director had a political statement to make. The characters were not developed because they were not real. They were simly manipulations of the far left leanings of the producer. Boring!
4,worth the watch,"I liked this movie. Well done but I was at first a little put off by the anti-Israeli comments and thoughts. (I hate this land or something similar spewed out by the love interest.) I do understand that many Jews are really anti-Israel. It is a mess. With all the arab killing of Jews you have to wonder why the subject was radical Jews. I know it is a valid subject, it just seems a way to slam Israel politically. Political agenda maybe??Worth the watch for some interesting insights.barb"
2,have mercy,"no question, the guy played a mean slide and created a real hoodoo mood. problem is, the performance is so overwrought and melodramatic, it's almost humorous. do not believe that was the intention. the blues are supposed to be an escape from hell."
1,No More Than A Wanna Be,"Whoever signed this guy must have been pretty desperate to jump on the Blues bandwagon. All I hear on this and his other discs is a dillusional amateur who got more chances than he deserved to make a listenable album. The HooDoo show was a smokescreen to hide the fact that there is no talent contained within.He may have believed in what he was doing, I'm not contesting his drive, just the fact that this stuff is not and never will be saleable or listenable. Hence, the preliferation of 2$ copies of this waste of plastic. Before this CD was half way through I too was howling ""MERCY, MERCY""......."
5,Masterful arrangements,"I bought and listened to the Israeli Wind Virtuosi & Friends Vol 1 / Rechtman CD. I was amazed at how well these original arrangements by M. Rechtman work out. Particularly the Haydn. I'm very familiar with the original Haydn oboe concerto. This arrangement for bassoon and string trio actually improves the original piece. Harmonies are richer and the structure is tighter, yet the arrangements remains very much in the style of a mature Haydn. The bassoon playing on the album is outstanding. The phrasing and tone quality are truly one of a kind. I highly recommend this CD."
4,Very Good,"""Waiting for the Moon"" and ""Put Our Hearts Together"" are the best tracks. Bruce's sincere politics with a strong dose of heart are again evident on this CD. BC is a deeply spiritual man and it shows on every one of his songs. He may be going strong into his 70's. Best of luck on your journey!"
5,MUCH better than the porcelain bars.!,"My porcelain flavor bars rusted through each year. After replacing them yearly (although under the warranty so at no cost), I finally decided to forego the headaches each year and purchase these stainless steel bars. I've used them for a few years now and they are GREAT!"
4,replacing bars,"I owned my grill for about 5 years before finally breaking down and buying new bars. However there is guy on ebay selling these bars which are of a higher gauge (thicker) steel (16ga) than the weber ones (18ga). I ordered them, which were just about the same price, and noticed they are much heavier and well made. The guy must work with steel and felt, like me, that the ones he got with grill could be better so he made his own and starting selling them. Searh for rcplanebuyer as the sellername."
1,wrong item description,"The photo of this item shows a full set of bars. What you receive, however, is only 5 long bars."
2,Does not do the job it's supposed to do,"I love my Weber grill, but some of the things it advertises that it does well, it doesn't always worked that way! Take these bars which are also supposed to prevent flareups and help ensure there aren't any hot and cold spots. I have both issues on my grill! Also, the nice stainless steel appearance goes away after the first use. They immediately turn brown."
1,Stainless Steel Flavorizer Bars,The bars were represented to be 25 inches long. In fact they measured 22&9/16 inches long. The required length is 23&7/16 inches. In either case they won't fit. I am in process or returning.
2,Disc Issues,"I received the workbook with a Floppy disc and CD Rom. As I understand from others who just took this class, the CD doesn't have everything (apparently it's because you need the floppy along with it). Well, who has a laptop that takes a floppy??? The instructor apparenlty provides a website link to download the data needed."
1,Is this a joke?,"A floppy disk? Really? When's the last time anyone used a floppy disk for anything other than a coaster? I don't care how amazing this MicroCase software is, if it can't be adapted to a CD, then it's completely worthless.You can download the software at the Wadsworth Publishing website, but if you've got a Mac, forget it. Assuming you can find access to a PC, you can download the software, but there's still a CD that has workbook pages that you can't download without the floppy disk.Hopefully this publisher will enter into the 21st century soon, but until then, pray that your institution is smart enough to require a less archaic book with usable software."
1,Ugh.,"I'm pretty math savvy but this book is terrible. It is poorly written and does not explain difficult subjects well. Often the author has a mocking tone and will say something like, this paragraph is confusing and you should reread it. It actually said that. In another part it asks what does this difference mean? ""(Think hard about this. I'll wait for you in the next paragraph.)"" What the hell does that even mean??? Maybe the author needs to do a better job explaining in a language students speak. We are not all stats majors and really don't give a damn. If you need this book for a class, I'm sorry. Sucks to be you (and me). Also, be prepared for the software to be unusable. It requires the use of a damned floppy disk...yes, a floppy. I had to download a copy from some random website after hunting for it for about half an hour. Please let's hope they stop using this book. Truly heinous."
4,It's Better to Build Boys than Mend Men,"Truett Cathy has maintained Christian values and ethics in the business world through his company, Chic-Fil-et. He has also touched the hearts of many people through his support and most importantly involvement with foster care. It's Better to Build Boys than Mend Men is a common sense approach to applying the Godly wisdom revealed in the Bible for encouraging young men and women as they are formed."
5,It's Better to Build Boys than Mend Men,"Great book! All parents should read for a gentle nudge in reevaluating our priorities. Raising our children to be morally, emotionally and physically sound should be a high priority in our busy lives. Reading this book has reminded me to really look and listen to my children. Thank you Mr. Cathy for taking the time to share your experiences."
5,Highly recommended!,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially parents, teachers, and anyone working with young people. This is a quick read, is well written, and even though I don't know him, I think S. Truett Cathey is a class act."
4,clear and illuminating,Excellent discussion of Russell's philosophical logic. Discussion of epistemology is a bit less lucid. Highly recommend overall.
2,The Not-So-Sillymarillion,"I just didn't think it was funny. I love Tolkien and I love parodies, but this just didn't do it for me. I've read funnier parodies of Tolkien's work on fanfiction sites.I think the best word I can come up with for this book is ""tired."" And did I mention it wasn't funny?"
1,Horrid.,Tries to do too much and becomes tedious. Bored of the Rings was much superior in lampooning the work Lord of the Rings because the authors didn't try to do too much.
5,Good works for a Dramatic Score,"Ok, Danny Elfman is a dark Composer, but he is able compose a great score for drama and this is a perfect example of his great talent. A break to Batman and Edward Scissorhands darks style. A subtile, intelligent and powerfull score. One of his best score ever composed. Go for it Elfman!!!"
3,Battery it up,"Well I dont know what to say, its a battery, its decent, it works, I use it you should too if you have the pocket projector that goes with it...."
4,Indispensable accessory to the PK10,"This battery has enabled me to use the PK10 in unusual ways (see my PK10 review for details) while not having to hunt for an AC socket or haul the AC adapter around, and makes the PK10 a truly ""go-anywhere"" projector.It would be nice if the battery could last longer than 2 hrs, but I guess that would make it the same thickness as the projector, which is not so nice..."
2,"Nice looking, Very weak",These look great and are easy to install but the magnets are too weak. I have some by another brand that are excellent. These are fine for light tools but anything heavier than a box wrench is going to slide right off.
5,This Dude Needs More Publicity,"Great stuff... unique too. Also, for what it's worth, ""Hang on to Your Ego"" is about as classic as a pop song gets, even though it doesn't get much play, and plus I don't really think of this as a ""pop"" album. But it is, just a unique one and a good one."
5,Your first step into Frank Black's great world.,"This may not be ""Teenager Of The Year"" or ""Cult Of Ray"" but it is still pure Frank Black. Black has a way of talking about science fiction while beign quirky all the same. It's Black's fiery hard rock roots combined with new styles, which are reminescent of They Might Be Giants. Since I am an avid ""The X Files"" fan ""Parry The Wind High, Low"" is my favorite song.Great album."
5,Is this a Pixies album?,"If you loved the Pixies for the right reasons (ie. not because of Kim Deal) you will love this CD. ""Los Angeles"" is a classic, ""Czar"" is really about John Denver wanting to go into space. Get it!"
3,Dog Toothpaste,"My Yorkie tolerates it, but doesn't really like it. She has had 5 teeth pulled because of dental problems, so I use it anyway."
3,"Looks like same stuff sold at Whole Foods, but MADE IN CHINA","I bought this for my son's lunch, and researched their official website. It said their products were made in Thailand, but in fact the box arrived today and it's made in China. Not much difference there, but I just cannot have a good conscience using these, now knowing they were made in China. I have been to several places China personally, and after seeing the factories, and the poor living conditions the workers live in (squalor), I really don't feel comfortable using these. The company has a great idea, but need to make these in a place where everyone can feel safe EATING off of them!"
3,Good basics,Very basic information about raising a beardie. I thought it'd be much more in depth and cover more of the animal and it's behaviors and how it should be properly taken care of and habitat set ups.
3,"Not the best, but ok","I have personally Been keeping bearded dragons for over 6 years, I also have many different books on bearded dragons. This book is ok, not the best but i have read worse. The book is a little behind times and will give you some out of date information. this book is full of good information and has alot of very detailed and beautiful pictures. All in all there are better Bearded dragon books out on the market, but this one is better than most."
3,good book so far,so far this was a good book but not really much info it had in it about vegetables and fruits I was hoping it would have in it.
5,I Feel Like An Expert After Reading This. Great Book For Beginners.,The first time I ever held a Bearded Dragon I wanted one. But I didn't know anything about them. This book taught me about the right way to care for a Bearded Dragon. The people who wrote this book definatley knew alot. Great info and great pictures. If your planning to get a Bearded Dragon for the first time I strongly advise you to read this book first.
3,"Good, pair it up with a feeder guide and you're set!","This book is helpful for a new bearded dragon owner. Yes, much of the information can be found online for free, but here it is all in one place and the info comes from vets. There are certain things here that more experienced beardie owners might find debatable, such as the substrate choices and what not. It's still a good book though. Even better if you pair this book up withCricket Breeding Made Easy: Your Guide to Raising Healthy Feeder Crickets! Buy that one with this one and you'll be totally set for your bearded dragons."
3,CULTURES 3?,i was a bit disappointed in this game-if you are a cultures addict you will probably still spend hours upon hours upon hours playing northland-as i did-but i think the original cultures is the most challanging-as far as the fighting goes-northland is waaaaay too easy-original cultures is most challanging-cultures 2 is certainly more challanging than northland-did they make northland for little kids?? im just wondering-the only new thing i can see in northland is you get to battle against-and to fight with ghost warriors which is kind of a cute idea-and the werewolf type characters are kind of creepy-otherwise-i am hoping that cultures 4 will be more challanging-the advanced graphics and gameplay of 2 and 3-but a game that offers a diehard cultures addict some serious challanges
4,Great(!) title cut. Alone worth the cost.,The first cut is well worth the price of the recording. The rest of the disc is OK.
4,Magnificent,"O'Connor is one of America's most under-appreciated writers. In ""The Last Hurrah,"" O'Connor captures how and why political machines are so much a part of American history. He does this in almost a Shakespearean fashion by illuminating a mayor who has stayed past his prime; a reader feels sympathy for the mayor while also recognizing that his time has come. The action unfolds against the backdrop of an urban center at the middle of the 20th Century. This is a fine achievement."
1,i threw up on this book and it improved the quality,"The religious studies department of my university forced this book upon us. I was utterly appalled by its excruciatingly painful dialogue, its complete lack of plot, and its deplorable ""character development."" I am mourning the loss of the trees that have laid themselves down in sacrifice for this vomit-inducing pile of trash that someone had the nerve to call a book. I disagree with all of the other ""people"" that have favorably reviewed this book. Don't give it a second look, don't go to the bookstore in search of it, leave this webpage now before you are tempted. Run away, run away, before it's too late. Cheers friends."
2,Not my style,"I like Old No. 1 and really enjoy Townes Van Zandt and Steve Earle and Emmylou Harris, but I can't really get into this album. It is ""nice"", but seems to really lack something. There is no grit or rawness to the music, which to me is essential in the folk/country music Clark plays."
1,Not easy to use at all,"This calculator is the required calculator for University classes I have taken. It is NOT user-friendly and it is NOT intuitive at all. I would NEVER recommend it, and would never have bought it unless I was forced by the university. My prof used it once in a physics lab and made the telling comment ""I see why you guys all complain about this calculator""."
1,horrible condition,dvd was listed as being in like new very good condition. came with food (I asssume) stains all over it and significant ware and tear to the cardboard case. I have bought over 30 dvds in the past 2 years on amazon this was the worst shape and most mislabeled quality product yet.
1,I never got this video!,"I never recieved my order! Obviously though, my money was taken right away, but the package never came.. and when i asked for the package no one could help me. This may completely turn me away from amazon.com and I used to be one of my favorite sites.. :("
4,Good memories,"This book brought back good memories of the ""God is an Englishman"" series.i wish he had written more or another series"
5,love this bible,"I have owned the NASB Ultrathin Ref. Bible and have used it everyday for 5 years. It is compact enough to go everywhere I go, and it does. It has held up extremely well and is no where near needing to be replaced despite heavy use. I own the bonded leather cover with the button flap. the button flap does an exellent job protecting the pages agaist such hazzards as car keys, nail files and what ever else may tatter them while in my purse. The construction of this bible is remarkably hardy. the only thing I wish it had at times is a ribbon marker. The print size is a bit small, but so is this bible, and if you write small enough you'll have room enough as I do to squeeze in plenty of notes. I currently own a macarthur, and a Thompson chain, but still rely on the NASB ultrathin as my favorite so far, and the one I always take to church."
2,Disappointed,"Yes, its easy to read and understand, I'll give the author that much. Instructions on ""how to"" of a crockpotare simple and easy to follow; however they only take only a few pages of the beginning of the book. Thebook is mostly recipes and in reading them, there really isn't any that stands out. I have found many morerecipes that are more simplified in preparation and in making the entire dish from searching online. I have also found more recipes in other crockpot cookbooks that are your average dinner meal from a simple chicken noodle soup topot roast.I didn't see anything that stands out to me that I would make from this book.I am sorry I purchased this book, I only got a few things out of it that I didnt know before on a crockpot, but Ialso have learned from reading much more online."
5,Handbook for future Presidents?,Is holistic Governance possible? The solutions are explained here in this book by Dr. Hagelin. A must read for any political science student!

5,A DIZZYINGLY BEAUTIFUL AURAL PAINTING,"They've been around the surf music scene... forever! Or so it seems. Best known for Beach Boyish vocal harmonies, The Malibooz have turned in a surprisingly deep, haunting album of spiritual music. Don't run away. The music evokes the power and emotion of the sea, and that seems to be where John Zambetti and company have found God. The production is thick, a crime on most recordings, but in the context of Living Water it works with the music to create a dizzyingly beautiful aural painting that will take your breath away if you allow it to. It's difficult to describe music like this. Try to imagine Brian Wilson in the middle of a profound religious epiphany. The result is magical; enough reverb, crash and roar to turn on the surf crowd and enough ethereal beauty to please new age fans. It's likely none of that matters much to The Malibooz. This seems like an extremely heartfelt declaration of devotion to God and ocean, and we're just happy to listen in."
4,A Fun and Quick Read,"Robin Rickards has written a clever, well-researched and refreshing murder mystery. This book is a quick, easy read - perfect for a rainy weekend. Robin writes in a relaxed, uncluttered style without tedious, page after page descriptions. This book is no-nonsense, cut-to-the-chase and FUN!Enjoy!"
4,i like the title.,"this was also my first Marc Olden book. it is very good, it has some parts that are a bit gory, but the story is great. the action is well written and fast. in a few places the story get's a bit slow, but overall it is very fast paced. i recommend this book to any one who likes action, gore, and stuff of that nature."
5,2005 ford escape,"These fit my nieces 3.0 v6 perfect, all the gaps were preset and they all went in perfect, not much more to say about plugs"
2,Cheap but not worth it,"The idea was to have a secondary battery for our FujiFilm digital camera. We searched for one that would be cost effective and found this unit. However, after three cycles, it refused to hold a charge using the FujiFilm charger. The charger works fine on FujiFilm branded batteries but not this one. All in all, a waste of money."
4,Nice Redesign of an old favorite,"Maybe 25 years ago I had the original verision of this rocket. It looked pretty much the same back then, but there have been a lot of improvements that you might not realize until you look closely. The old one was pretty typical balsa fin construction with a plastic nose cone, and it ran great and very high on D12-5 engines. This one's the same size, but now has all-plastic fin can that accepts E engines, all plastic fins, and much larger custom plastic nose cone. All the plastic parts add a lot of pretty details, but it has added some weight also, so the ability to run on E engines is very welcome. Flies very stable. Upgrade to a larger parachute if possible, as with an 18"" chute you are going to break off fins on landing (I did even with the 24""). Fin breakage is the only negative I'll note here, but the good news is the plastic construction makes it much easier to re-attach without too much cosmetic damage. Good purchase and I like it."
4,"I had a dream, nick","I think this is the album where Nick Cave began to really move from his insane madman phase to his true title as master song writer. This one is my favorite among the bad seeds ""middle"" releases. While it's not my favorite by him, it's definately worth it's weight in Gold. I just dig the feverish acoustic guitar playing in "" i had a dream, joe!"""
3,"Dark, weird, twisted, and very...fascinating.","There was a book my wife wanted once called ""Murder in America."" It had stories about infamous murders and pictures to go with them, mostly crime scene photos which left nothing to the imagination. I could not help but read this book even though it made me shudder and feel filthy, somehow.I feel the same way about this album. It's weirdly compelling. Cave's histrionics (and he is quite histrionic, let no one deceive you) are not as grating as I expected, but leavened with large doses of very black humor, and some lyrics that will not leave your skull no matter how hard you try to scrub them out. He is a good songwriter and a great singer, acrid and uncompromising in his approach. On a lot of the songs here there is a sense that he is almost compelled to write and sing these songs by something within himself that he cannot quite understand, and that fascinates me to no end.This is my first exposure to Nick Cave; it will certainly not be my last."
3,Henry's Dream,"Henry's Dream being Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds 1992 release is an aggresive and slightly insane release. Apparently, Nick Cave himself does not like this record. I disagree. Whilst it is not as good as Let Love In. It is still quite good. The problem that I see with this album is that the lyrics are not as strong as on Let Love In. Papa won't leave you, Henry is a perfect example where he could have edited the lyrics a bit since it is a bit wordy and the singing sounds a bit pressed at times. As if he is affraid that he will not be able to fit in all the lyrics to match the melody. Still, there are other tracks such Straight to you that are more at tune with lyrics and melody. Still and all this i a very solid release and I give it 3 stars."
5,Brilliant,"An essential classic for any darkmeister or general cool urbanite's CD collection. All of the tracks on this album are excellent; I can't pick a favourite but I can listen to ""John Finn's Wife"", ""Papa Won't Leave You Henry"" and ""Straight To You"" over and over again. It hasn't dated one bit and although Nick and the boys may have crafted a darker, more Romantic sound with their recent album 'no more shall we part' this still resonates of early Seeds and the amazing intensity they pack into an album. Nick's voice isn't fantastic musically or technically- but it's rendered irrelevant by the sheer emotion and soul he puts into his music. Not many bands match this."
4,A decent mix of covers,"Leaving aside the TV show tie-in nature of this album, this soundtrack stands up nicely as a concept album, with female artists covering classic tunes relating to love and domestic life.A glance over the list of artists will suggest the soundtrack will be somewhat uneven, and that's borne out by a through listening. SheDaisy doesn't really have the chops of Martina McBride, Liz Phair or the Indigo Girls (and the latter don't even seem to be trying particularly hard).Some artists, like Phair or Gloria Estefan, try and put their own spin on things, while others do a more note-for-note classic rendition. It's typically those trying to make the song their own who succeed the best, and there are enough such performances to make this album work.Fun stuff, although it's a shame more of it never made it onto the actual TV show.A recommended purchase for fans of Liz Phair, Gloria Estefan or Martina McBride."
5,"easy to use, easy to look at","This model has a little handy table off to the side that really helps. No longer am I reaching over to the picnic table or balancing a plate of food while I remove the lid and place the food on the grill.The hand ash catcher makes the chore of collecting and disposing of the ash much cleaner.The grill can be put together in 15 to 20 minutes, the instructions are clear and easy.I also love the green color - this model is available in colors other than black."
5,Weber--The name says it all.,"This grill is great for two to six people.Everything about it is heavy duty.If you've been buying the cheap ones every couple of years do yourself a favor,spent a few bucks and enjoy the flavor of outdoor cooking at it's best.You'll love it!"
4,great lite over 5 yrs,"I've had the PIAA's both the 9005(high beam) & the 9006 (low beam) for over 5yrs, and I just had to replace 1 of the high beams. Amazon is a great place to shop as I was quoted $156.00 for the 2pak locally and found it here for $60. Thanks Amazon"
4,PIAA Extrem White,I am using it for my motorcycle. It is near white and brighter than my old one. I really like it. I have been using it for about a month so I can't say much for its reliability. If you are not using HID conversion kit then I definitely recommend this one.
4,work fine,"not as bright white as i would like but work pretty good for the money, would recomend these to others."
3,Difference based on vehicle,"I installed these on a 2011 Subaru Impreza Hatchback Sport, but they did not make a difference. I was hoping for a notable difference to none avail. My thought is not so much an issue with the bulbs but more the design and location of the fog lights. The fog lights on these vehicles are recessed in, therefore limiting any wide angle of light. You will not see any difference if you have these types of vehicles."
5,Good laughs in a charming travelogue,"Barbara Mandelowitz McMahon writes her travel memoirs with a charming touch. The laughs come regularly, and the book is a pleasure, whether or not you're planning on a South American Island adventure.Our intrepid couple keeps coming close to disaster, but never have a bad experience. Their humorous close calls with island bureaucracy, unreliable airlines, annoying French tourists, challenging rental cars and traffic, just seem to bring them closer together. While there are clouds following them around, it never gets worse than slightly overcast, with bright sun by the end of each chapter.And what are we to make of the mysterious ""Rick"" figure. He is hardly says anything, and yet is at the center of Ms. McMahon's attention. How are we to understand this Zen-like figure and his inexplicable role in this delightful travelogue? Maybe because he is simply the best at ""getting the ice."""
5,Woody Allen in the Tropics,"Neurotic, hip & funny. Laughed out loud - many times. Refreshing change from the usual dull travel fare."
3,Improvising Women,"Darling is best at capturing and identifying with the state of career women in the feminist decades: ""The women I knew improvised."" As a reporter for Washington Post Style, she becomes involved with the married head of the Style section; he divorces, they marry, and then Darling's interesting soul searching gets blunted by melodrama as he suffers the death of a son, they have a baby, and then he dies himself, leaving Darling to fare forward with her daughter."
1,Didnt get everything described/Seller will not respond to emails,"I ordered a figure and in the description it stated that it came complete with accessories. I received the figure but I did not receive any accessories. I tried to contact the seller three times so that we could resolve the problem, but I didn't receive a response. I would not recommend dealing with this seller. They do not give you what they advertise and they will not respond to emails."
3,Good starting point,I agree with other reviewers that this book is not high on content - BUT it is a good starting point for those wishing to add some elements of color to their lives. You can get this book in Pottery Barn (& such) so this should give you an idea of the content. I think it is worth a few bucks as a jumping off point for some color ideas. And why not rearrange the pages yourself - it makes it a little more useful!
3,"VISUAL, not content","As others have said, this book has almost zero how-to content. It is delightful to the eyes, however, especially for Marguerita lovers and Jimmy Buffet fans. (""Don't worry, be happy."")It presents a lot of color combinations for those tired of off-white and beige, but too timid to make a change without reassurance. I agree that the colors are in the Carribean style, so the colors would be good for summer decorating or a decidely feminine style.With this book, I found it easier to show my husband color combinations I liked and get his response very quickly (he even surprized me!)."
1,Don't waste your money,This was great for a 5 year old playing house but cannot seriously be used for any type of color choosing. If the pages were able to be removed and switched around it might be slightly helpful for comparison but I'd rather spend the money on a fan deck at the paint store or buy a couple quarts of paint and try them on my wall.
2,A fun toy but not all that useful,"This was fun to play with, but the ""rooms"" shown are obviously unreal, which reduces the appeal of each. And there isn't any help in figuring out how to use the color variations. I sat here and flipped back and forth, entertained for awhile before I realized that this wasn't really going to help me figure out colors for my house. There's nothing about working with pattern, either. Clever but not worth the money."
4,"GOOD, QUICK IDEAS OF HOW COLOR IMPACTS A ROOM","I think this book is great for decorating novices like myself. As a color-deprived, white-walled apartment dweller on the verge of buying a condo, I'm glad to have a tool to help myself decide what I love and what I hate. The only possible drawback I've noticed about the color palate is that it has a decidedly ""Caribbean"" flavor--neutrals combined with tangerines, aquas, fuscias, parrot greens, etc. Maybe that's a good thing--I would have never looked at cherry as a real wall color if I hadn't seen it in this book. Opens your creativity! Good for scaredy-cats! Cheap way to avoid an expensive mistake! Fun!"
1,The Color Book is not likely to be helpful.,"The Color Book claims to have 11,264 color combinations for your home. I don't know how the publisher did the math, but you'll never squeeze more than a couple hundred combinations from this book. That may still sound like a lot, but it isn't. For each room, you get maybe 20 color combinations, and that's if you tear or cut out the pictures and assemble your own pictures from the snippets, which is what you'd have to do if you want to get any use out of this book. For a color, it gives at most three shades, which is far from adequate, since every brand of paint has at least 30 shades of any color, and using a different shade can give a totally different look."
2,"Not for the ""classic-minded"" decorator","Lime-green or tangerine-colored walls are not my idea of beauty. Yes, there's a lot of color combinations that you can choose from, but you'll have to remove every single strip in order to see what most of them will look like together. Otherwise, you're limited to the color combinations that have already been put together for you. Will be returning this one."
2,There are better filters out there,"I have never had a filter give me so much trouble on start-up. I opened the box and the intake extension tube was missing. OK, I could make do. I put the filter together, put it on the tank and I have to say it started immediately. But then it started to gurgle, lose suction and go dry. I took it apart 5 times trying to find the problem. I checked the impeller, siliconed all the seals and removed and siliconed the intake hose where it meets the canister. Those intake and exhaust tubes are loose and leaky. I wanted to like the bio wheel, but it's just too big for the back of the tank. I don't want to cut out another section on my hood to accomodate it. The filter has been running for the past half hour. I don't know if that will last another minute or another year, but the aggravation experienced in assembling it isn't worth the money spent."
1,this is pathetic,"bands need to quit trying to evolve their sound and ""mature"" this cd was horrible, but then again i wasnt surprised as Hours was lame too. i fell in love with this band when seven ways to scream your name was released. those songs are what made FFAF what they are. i cant imagine anyone who liked FFAF from teh beginning to enjoy this. bands need to stick to what they know. FFAF obviosuly isnt on television so they arent exactly getting famous turning into soft whiny little girls. basically like the guy before me said, if u liked old FFAF dont get this, but if you want a rock album about a fisherman then thsi is all you."
2,Pretty dissapointed,"This album does not contain any of their great hard stuff like ""All the Rage"" or any of their moving sappy songs like ""This Letter"". Instead its a completely different sound that has dissappointed me as a long time FFAF fan. There is, however, 2 or 3 pretty good songs I liked. But if your looking for the songs that got you interested in them in their earlier albums you wont find it here. Even though I believe FFAF is better, if you like their style you will most likely be interested in Thrice as well. Check them out.PS - If this is your first FFAF album, dont get this one, get HOURS. Its by far their best album. Every track is awesome."
4,Really 3.5 stars.,"I just don't know what to say about this album.I mean it's good album on it's own,but something I wouldn't expect from these guys.The tracks sound like pop rock.I mean wheres the screamo from there first album.Seems to me there trying to do a Linkin Park,another great band completely changing their sound.I wasn't a big fan of hours but it was a alright album,at least they screamed on that album.We all know a lot of bands are changing their sound but they are taking baby steps,not a leap like this one.So if your thirst for screamo isn't subsided then go pick up Lies for the Liars by The Used or Chrome by Cartel."
2,"it's ok-Casually dressed, and hours are the 2 albums worth getting","It must be insanely hard to top casually dressed and hours. 2 of the most amazing albums in a hard rock genre thats constantly changing. There are some lame, emo type, dual vocals, shyte bands out there(Thursday-worst). This band is the real deal. Have both albums in my jukebox at work(nyc downtown). Waking up(sleeper single song on Casually)."
2,This CD is bland-rock.,"I had heard good things about this band, so I decided to check them out. I was very disappointed. It all sounds pretty formulaic and overproduced. No discoveries here. Skip it."
2,Saw this coming... Funeral for Funeral for a Friend,"Casually Dressed - Awesome album, and why I love this band.Hours - Obviously more mainstream oriented, but still very good.Tales Dont Tell - Purely mediocre, almost boring.I do NOT own this cd, but listened to the whole thing several times on their myspace page. The only reason i am considering buying the CD is because they are (were?) my favorite band. Am I rushing to conclusions? I sure hope so. Congratulations FFAF, 12 year old girls are going to love you."
3,A great progression for the band,"Great music but the terrible whiney vocals let it down.The band have matured (some on guys, aren't you over screamo yet??) but the singer is the weak link in this band."
1,Boo Hiss,"Wow what a terrible album. I loved all of this bands stuff pre-""Tales Don't Tell Themselves"" (I even gave ""Hours"" the benefit of the doubt on a few less than stellar songs out of general respect for this band). The first time I heard this album all the way through, I thought it was some mistake. Maybe the manufacturer printed the wrong cd? How could this plain, lyrically and instrumentally VANILLA album belong to Funeral For a Friend. Alas, it does. The truth is, the entire thing is extremely boring and void of any passion or effort (and the lyrics are incredibly cheesy and bland). Notice that while their previous cds (some being 6 years old) are selling for over $2 used on this site, this cd (came out almost a year ago) is selling for 1 cent. That about sums it up for me."
2,A let down,"I agree with most of the input stated by others, the album is a huge let down. This is very soft and popie compared to what they have produced in the past. It's not a bad album but if your a long time listener of FFAF be prepared for change. The screaming and fast guitar playing is not there."
2,A Funeral For A Fan....,"Destined to be a one of my favorite bands of all time... this 2nd major record release...I really dunno what to say....The album has a stong opening track, and after that all the emotions just slowly begin to walk away. If u are a fan of FFAF you will obviously notice that this album was not put together very well as far as music and lyrics. The production to me personaly is great....The catchy melodies are gone, the tearful, and grasping lyrics are nowhere to be heard...after 3 amazing albums...FFAF have found their senior slump....maybe next time...I just didnt think it was possible...and it's apparent becuz most reviewers are also agreeing with the lack of emotion on this album...maybe Matt put all his heart in his solo cd...we'll never know....and I don't see this album as maturing....I see this album as a fork in the road...So sad...a true fan now dressed in black for his own Funeral...."
5,Excellent snap caps,"Yes, they will hold tiny screws in drywall, but they also work very well as snap caps for dry firing your 22LR pistol or rifle. Get your dry fire drills in. Learn to squeeze gently. Couple these with a dime resting on the barrel and squeeze. Keep the dime balanced and you will soon be an expert."
1,worst cd ever,Songs on it are horrible and don't waste your money. I love That 70's show but hate this cd.
1,cheap trick sucks,"the theme song for this show was waaaaaaaaaaaay better when it was done the first time during the first season, that version f-ing rocked. cheap tricks version is just that a cheap trick, they must have seen the show was getting successful and jumped on the band wagon cheap trick is weak. i almost purchased this cd and realized that it had the p*ssy Cheap trick version of the song i wanted, so i will never buy this cd and i think its weak becuase of the group cheap trick."
5,The Best of the 70s,"I grew up in the 70s and found this CD to be the perfect album to blast on a weekend. It encapsulates some of the best music from my teen years and includes some songs that are hard to find on CD anywhere. I also bought the ""That 70s Show Jammin'"" album which my 10 year old daughter (a fan of the TV show) loves as well."
5,Would not be without this now,"I love this collection of quotations, seachable by words such as humor, hope, strength, love, peace. It's just wonderful to easily find something specific or just browse through and be inspired."
5,The Inner side of Nick Cave,"To me, this is an album about love and loss. Fear and rejection. And wanting to see the things that you know you may never see again. A great album to end the day with. Nick Cave leaves nothing to your imagination on this album. I think that Cave is one of the best artists of our time. the piano pieces are brilliant and his lyrics are disturbing and calming all at the same time. A little different style for him but all the better for fans with great taste and open minds. Enjoy."
5,Another in a string of amazing recordings.,"First, just to be fair, I should tell you that I own every CD that Nick Cave ever made and the lowest rating that I'd give any of them would be four stars. I was afraid that Nick would never top Murder Ballads, so I was overjoyed when I heard this CD. These songs have the ability to stay with you. They flow from one to another like some strange, dark river. Give a listen to the haunting ""Where do we go now, but nowhere"" and you'll know what I'm talking about."
3,Very good,"Very good album. I'm not a Nick Cave fanatic, I don't listen to him all the time, I don't own all the albums. I'm here just as someone who loves music, knows Nick Cave without being a ""follower"" to say this is really quite wonderful. Some songs lovely, all unique - a love song in Nick Cave's hands is a love song in no other's. If the slow quality, the sound of his voice, and his style of lyric is something you'd like - you'll love it. If you want the younger Nick Cave or faster music or ""murder ballads,"" this isn't the one."
3,Lovely Songs But Too Dispassionate For Me,"Suddenly, Nick Cave mellows out and sings earnest songs accompanied by a cheesy church-style organ.Yikes!Yes, his voice is always haunting and rich. Yes, these songs are subtle and strong. He's even retained much of his diabolical lyricism.BUT GOD-DAMN THAT CHEESY CHURCH-STYLE ORGAN!"
5,Great outdoor chair,"I bought this chair for my husband for Father' Day. We just love it. Very comfortable, no assembly required--just take it out of the box, unfold it, and sit down.Light enough to carry and move, and folds up for easy storage. After a day in the yard, it's a great chair to relax in. Do you offer somone to come and bring Margarita's??"
2,Owned for 4 years,I bought this off Amazon 4 years ago and while it is very comfortable it does not stand the test of time...within the first year it started to rust and the cording is very stretched out. I've had better luck with a cheaper knockoff I bought at BJ's.
2,"Comfortable and trendy, but vastly overpriced","I have tried these chairs out several times, and they ARE comfortable, but they seem rather flimsy for the price. The price here is better than some I've seen, but it IS a folding lounge chair after all!"
3,"Very comfortable, but . . .","The value of this chair depends on the climate where you live. It was given to me in LA as a gift, and was great there; however, when I moved to Tucson, AZ where it was exposed to the sun a great deal of the time, the fabric ended up rotting and a large person actually fell through it! It was only 2 yrs. old at that time."
1,WHY I WOULD LIKE AFULL REFUND,"THE CHAIR ITSELF IS EXTREMELEY COMFORTABLE! THE MATERIALS THAT ARE USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION,LEAVE ALOT TO BE DESIRED. AFTER THREE MONTHS OF US,THE METAL AT THE HINGES AND THE ZIG ZAG BAR HOLDING THE MESH FABRIC ARE COMPLETELY RUSTED OUT. THE FINISH IS SUPPOSED TO BE POWDER COATED. THE CHAIRS WERE KEPT UNDER AN AWNING DURING THE DAY AND BROUGHT INSIDE AT NIGHT.I AM TOTALLY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE GETTING IN TOUCH WITH ME. 610 664 7550"
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun","You pick a Tamagotchi character and you name and dress others.You work at shops and make stuff (cards for the card shop), a garden shop where you help plants grow and sell them. You can unlock shops and work at them to unlock other shops and if you do well you earn new accessories for the Tamagotchi.My daughter loves this game and has tons of fun playing!"
4,Great Sharpener,i like this sharpener with the curved shape. It is very practical when sharpening curved blades. It fits well into my bag with no sharp edges. Also Amazon had a good price and delivered quickly. I use Amazon a lot when I can.
4,Dated but worthwhile,"More interesting for an examination of how the perception of Hamilton has changed over time than as a biography (the book is over 100 years old). The author was the Senator who destroyed President Wilson's dream of a League of Nations, leaving him a broken man"
4,Sports Venom: A Decent Man-Watch,"I've had this watch for over 5 years. The resin band broke recently, but the watch is still running. The product description mentions a 2.5-year battery life, but I'm sure it can last much longer with limited alarm and Indiglo use. The watch wears comfortably and is quite durable. It's also easy to program and has plenty of functions.To give a better feel for the size of the watch--the silver-colored portion is about 3.7 x 4.6 cm. The thickness from the window to the steel back is about 1.2 cm. The watch is a bit big for women and children. Even at the tightest notch, the watch fit loosely on me--but I do have incredibly skinny wrists.Also, a note: The viewing window is slightly convex and sits higher than the silver-colored frame. Because it bulges out a bit, it's prone to scratches. The window doesn't damage easily, but running it against bricks and walls will certainly leave marks."
5,better then Picture of Nectar,"As much as I like a Picture of Nectar, Rift remains as my favrote Phish cd. It's a really good cd to settle down to, especially after a long day at work, or when you come back from a party with a bunch of buddies. It leaves you drained yet satisfied after the cd is over. Some of Phish's best are on this album."
4,A Nice Introductory Album,"Rift was my intro to Phish so many years ago. It was a favorite group of some friends of mine from Marching Band, and I was just recently dissolutioned by They Might Be Giants and looking for a new favorite band. I found what I was looking for here. I have found, like others, that Phish, like TMBG, is often not a band you can work backward with. If you like the first thing that you pick up by them and decide to buy earlier work, chances are pretty good that you won't like it as much as later work, depending on how you evolve through your music. Rift seems to be the first album they produced in their evolution in their studio sound, when they started to move away from studio productions that attempt to sound like their live music. If you have an interest in the evolution of Phish, Rift is a good way to go."
5,My favorite Phish studio album.,This is my favorite Phish studio album. Great start to finish.Some of my favorite songs are on this album.
4,Love it!,One of my favorite Phish albums. A classic. Don't know why I waiting so long to buy it..probably because I knew all the songs already from their live albums but is always interesting to back and listen to the studio version.
2,"Flacid music, little enjoyment","To all of the Phish apologists and blind fanatics who gave this five stars, I say, ""Come on! "" This has to be one of the worst phish albums they ever released. These people should expect a lot more from such accomplished musicians. I am a huge phish fan and this album was a huge disappoinment. Maybe it was a concept album, if so, please drop the concept. Leave it off stage so we never have to be berated by these tunes. It's not as bad as this sounds but I KNOW Phish can do a whole lot better. Take Billy Breathes for example. That CD has feeling, purpose, and emotion, while maintaining an appeal to each song that catches when you listen to it. This album just puts me to sleep. Buy Junta, Billy Breathes, and Story of the Ghost before you even touch this thing. If you have all those, stick to trading, this would just be a major disappointment."
2,Don't trust the blind (deaf) apologists,"Hey, let's be real. This album goes in the back of your cd book because it's definitely nothing special. Many of the Phish apologists (and there are a lot now) say that this is concept or that it sounds like one of their best studio albums. I THINK NOT! This album has little emotion and depth. The songs have little feel and even less flavor. Compared to their newer albums, especially Ghost and Billy Breathes, this album is one of those that you would rather burn then purchase. And that's just to see where Phish went wrong with this one."
1,Horriphic,"After buying Junta, I thought that I liked Phish, but Rift is terrible. Don't get me wrong; the virtuosic playing is there, but this effort falls short in the songwriting department. ""Lengthwise"" and ""Wedge"" are particularly wretched offerings. From the barbershop quartet intro on the title track through every track afterwards, the lack of taste shines through! As I said, this album was bad enough to completely turn me off from this instrumentally talented band."
1,insipid refuse,"This disc has no soul. How could a supposed musical ""concept"" concerning a rift in a human realtionship be so void of human emotion? I couldn't even bare to think that someone might actually see it in my collection, so I sold it. The instrument sounds are produced well, overall the sound is clean, but the music is lame. If compared to any number of other rock guitarists (Fripp, Howe, Vai, Satriani, Belew, Zappa to name but a few) jazz guitarisrs (Pass, Hall, Roberts, Montgomery, Benson, Metheny, Frissell, Stern, Abercrombie, once again naming but a few) or real musical virtuosos (Bach, Beethoven, Brahams, Mozart, Chopin, Debussy, Starvinsky, Rachmaninoff, Bird, Diz , Miles, the list goes on...) Anastasio commands no instrumental virtuosity on this effort. The only other Phish disc that I still own is ""Billy Breathes"". At least that one has some emotion. I would rather listen to old Glen Campbell lp's than ever spin this drivel in my player again."
5,One of the best,"Anyone who does not apreciate this album, by putting it down with harsh accusations of anti-muscianship and talentless efforts is out of their minds. This albums was original and well balenced- and musically diverse. This is the type of album that I wish every band can produce. Now I love Phish, and this is not my favorite album by them, but it is spetacular!"
3,"Least media-friendly, hazy at times.","While I'm sure I'll get myself into trouble by saying this, ""Rift"" is my least favorite Phish disc at the moment. Sure, it does have its high points, but it's just not the Phish that I love best. It's a ""concept album"" (whatever that means), and reminds me just a bit of Pink Floyd, perhaps. Get this disc only after you get SS&P and Junta."
3,Mostly memorable,"3 1/2Another worthy early release. Not as coherent as many others, but full of daring passages often including blissful compositional shots to the heart. Too much over-intellectualizing quirk however, keeps a lid from these proceedings spilling over into a complete time-lapse."
2,Rift - It's nothing great,"Rift was the third Phish Album I bought following Farmhouse and Billy Breaths. And I must say that after listening to those two, rift is not all that great. I does however offer some great guitar work. But as with most Phish albums it lacks lyrical creativity. But I don't want to sell it short. Musically this is an all right album. So if you have some extra cash and you like Phish Go ahead check it out. Maybe you'll see something here that i didn't."
3,The Concept Album,"Every band needs a concept album, and this is theirs. Some really brilliant music in this album, even though many have criticized it as being too 'produced' or 'fake-sounding' (read:this is not like a live show). ""The Horse"" sadly represents for me Trey Anastsio's growing-up song - the point at which his music's subject matter matured (i.e. he started writing about love and babys instead of Ribosomes and Multibeasts (credit to long-time lyricist Tom Marshall)).I love this album, but a first-time buyer should start with a live album and then move toward earlier work (Junta, Lawn Boy, Pic of Nectar)"
3,Please fix my adventurer!,"This is a Dynamic DVD, wherein is contained the most honorable blades of Ichigo Kurosaki, but then gives more with the femaleS.I love the high quality, if the current takes me away, I'd like to visit some of their beatnick zen way. The elder Confucius bids several actions, and the lovely is hence saved by none other than, Rynji; strait from the DS. That's right; Samurai sun children with their abilities and system of honor. Another good hit from Amazon.com!"
4,The 50 cent killer,"Now i know some of yall are thinking whats the hell wrong with him but line for line RULE is better then 50cent masscare how so Jarule shows us inside of his mind on songs like Life goes On and Passion but he never shy from his selling cds ideas on songs like Wonderful and Caught UP but unlike 50 whos some kinds ""Thug Killer"" Ja shows hes a regular man who after all these years of rapping he still as unsure of the rap game like when he 1st started"
4,Review of Ja Rule's R.U.L.E.,"I got this Cd for Christmas and it's good.+I will rate the songs on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best+2. Last of the Mohicans - BELOW AVERAGE 6/103.

4,Better than the last couple albums,This album was surprisingly good..... Especially considering the fact that he doesn't try to sing as much as he did on his previous albums. Most of the songs on the album are pretty good....and it's good to hear him rappin' like u used 2 like on his first album...... Another good thing about this album is that he doesn't have many features from the murder inc fam....believe it or not that's a good thing. If u r a ja rule fan..... u should really like this album
3,Nothing special,This cd has its ups and downs such as wonderful and new york but this is not even close to his first solo project. Back then he had the fire and wasn't into making all these videos with r&b singers. I think he needs to go back to where he stared when he was way more street.
2,Rule!?!...When did he do that?,"Ja Rule has let me down so bad. I actually liked his ""Pain is Love"" album a lot. Its a shame he had to fall off so hard, but damn, when youve got some of the wackest people in the industry behind you, I guess its inevitable. The best songs on here are ""Get it Started"" with Claudette Ortiz, who is just BLAZING on this track, and ""Where I'm From"" featuring Lloyd. ""Wonderful"" is a good song and all, and I actually think R. Kelly and Ashanti did a good job on the hook. I'm just sick of him dwelling on how ""b*tches wanna bring him down""...damn, if thats all we're gonna hear for an hour plus, save it...cuz I can hear that in the unemployment line. He needs to up his lyrical content, and bring it back to where he came from, not all this pop glitz-and-glamour sh*t. What's goin on, Ja?Oh, and what is the damn point of the Stripping Game skit?Save ya money and buy either Jacki-O's new CD, or wait and buy Nas' ""Streets Disciple"". (Its gonna be a hot ONE~)"
5,R.U.L.E.,I am a Ja Rule fan and was fortunate enough to stumble across such a wonderful deal for this c.d. Would definitely recommend it to oeople!!
5,lets be realistic,"this ablum really prove how talented jarule is,despite all the 2003 turnoil,he still came out stronger and better,this ablum is one of jarule`s best ablum,all the songs are banging,and the lyrics and ryhmes reflect to whats happening today,well i reccomend this ablum to those that are not wannabes,those that listen and knows whats real hiphop is,not what the cb4(gunit) gangstar turn hiphop to.this ablum is way better than massacare,for real,i`m not hateing,for those that doubt,try and compare.jarule keep doing ur thang,don`t let the haters hold u down,.....holla back."
2,Not his best work,Ja Rule dropped the soap and bent over in County jail and was violated over and over and over by some big fellow named pretty Tony!
1,This alblum is gay,This guys gets on my nerves he acts like he can rap but it sounds like a bunch of mumble jumble and come on the whole m.u.r.d.e.r. thing is getting tired I mean get a new hook and I hope G-unit smashes him until hes dead
1,50 cent is way better,stop beefin wit 50. He's obviously a better rapper. Even Eminem dissed you. I'm giving it 1 star for New York because Fat joe was good. pitifulout
1,The Truth,"This albums sucks so bad. There is only one true reviw on the page the one that says this ablums gay is right this album is gay. G-Unit is way better then ja rule or murder inc. He needs to stop saying s**t like whats his name no one care what his name is. There is usually one song i like on ja rules albums, this time it is wonderful ft. R. Kelly & Ashnti. This song is pretty good Kelly does outstanding, not much Ashanti but he uses her too much, needs to get another r&b female (he can't). Ja Rule does a little better then usual on this song. Overall this album is 1/10."
2,* Hate Ja Rule*,"Yo Ja Rule is a freakin wanna-be. I hate him and Murder Inc, 50 and Shady are da best rappers in the biz. Wow I hate him so badly, da only reason he got 2 stars is because ""Wonderful""- w/ Ahanti and R.Kelly is actually a good song ... but not Ja *my @ss* Rule's part... only R Kellys (*.. if it wasnt for the money...*)."
1,Tha Name of This Album Should Be P.U.N.K,"Ja Rule is a lil sissy. His rap is trash. Whoever said he was tha 50 Cent killa is doin some real strong drugz. 50 Cent almost completely destroyed Ja Rule's career. Ja Rule is not a gangsta. He does abunch of little punk ass love songs. Aint no real thugz jammin Ja Rule music. Only femalez like Ja Rule. If u wanna hear some gangsta stuff, go pick up that Slim Thug."
3,Ja rule has,"Ja Has switched up his game with this album, The beat and lyrics are better than Blood in my eye album. and ashanti is not the only featured artist on the album but he did a great collobrated artist to choose , Like R.kelly & Llyod ."
1,C'mon people!!!!!!!! it's R&B,"What happened at the award shows? what happened to his career??? No show!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ja is nothing but a wanna be rapper hanging on the jocks of the real rappes (fat joe, Jadaa and etc) he is too much into the singing (of which he cannot do) and if anybody thinks he is a good rapper GET YOUR HEAD EXAMINED!!!!!!. I bet Ja fan's like P diddy right? c'mon!!!!!!!!!!! I thought I told ya that he should stop! I thought I told ya that he should stop!!!!!!"
1,Worst Album He's ever Made,"Simply put, ""Wonderful"" is the only good song on this Album. I'm pissed that I wasted my money on this one song. If you don't already do this, I advise you to listen to samples of albums on line before purchasing from now on. I learned the hard way. I haven't met one person that disagrees with me on this. One more album like this and I think JA will be forced into retirement."
4,R.U.L.E.,"JA RULE (R.U.L.E.) ALBUM IS NICE LUV ALL THE SONGS2,3,5,7,11,12,13,16,17, AND HOT SONG 18 CHECK IT OUT"
4,Great Comeback,"Everyone can now like Ja Rule again! LOL! Now that the feud is over, Ja can finally get back to what he does best....using his creativity on the tracks. IMO, Blood In My Eye were all pushed to get @ 50. That's why I think many people didnt not like it cause thats not his style @ all. There are many featured artists, which I like about him. He can callaborate with almost anyone. . ""Wonderful"", ""Caught Up"", & ""Passion"" are my favorites on here. I think that this will be a banga for months to come."
1,(zero stars) if u buy this it will be a....,waste of timewaste of moneywaste of lifewaste of everythinggo get The Game- The Documentary instead
2,it's ok,"this is an ok album. i m not a big ja rule fan, but this one is ight. the best song is lige goes on. if u r a big ja fan, then this cd is for u, if u r not, then u probably wont like this too much."
1,STOP BEEFIN WITH 50!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"50 CENT IS WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY BETTER THAN YOU. SO STOP DISSIN HIM. JA`RULE IS A LIL SISSY. SO MOVE OVER, BECAUSE 50 IS THE KING OF NEW YORK AS SIMPLE AS THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,HE IS A WANKSTA AND I SMELL PUSSY,"he just needs to retire. screw this non-gangsta. no real G sings, they just rap, GOD!"
3,Better than 50's album,"yeh I think 50 is generally better (mainly because of some of his old stuff like power of the $) But I think This album is better than the massacare at least it has 3-4 good songs unlike 50's which has like 2 in my opinion ""candy shop"" ""piggybank"""
3,Ja,"Though I am a big Ja fan I was dissapointed by the album to call it his best is just being ignorant there are a couple hot tracks new york, new york, the manual, wonderful, caught up, bout my business but 336 and pain is love i thought had more hot single tracks blood in my eye or venni vetti vicci still the best he has put out"
4,ima fan again,"Ja rule gets respect on this album. he aint let 50 change who he is. he got his chick tracks, he got his singin jumpoffs and he got his gangsta tracks. he got 50 dissin people that come on ja rule song(jadakiss and fat joe) for some odd reason. 50 is becoming a cornball but anyway ja doin his thing. of course it gotta couple of skippables but its real good."
4,He's Back!,"This is a great album from Ja Rule. I'm glad that he's back to his R&B/Hip-Hop style. This album is a definite improvement from last year's ""Blood In My Eye"". My favorite tracks on this album are: ""Wonderful"", ""Caught Up"", ""Get It Started"", ""New York"", and ""Where I'm From"". Those are just my favorites, but the rest of the album is terrific also. If you like the Ja that you heard on hits like ""Always On Time"", ""I'm Real"", ""Ain't It Funny"", and ""Down 4 U"", I'd suggest this album for you. It's a wonderful combo of those types of songs, plus songs like ""Clap Back"". Ladies & Gentlemen....He's Back!!!"
1,Ja Rule remains off his ball...what the hell man,I am not much of a Ja Rule fan but Venni Vetti Vecci was a tyte CD. After that he just fell off his game.What made is worse is that he missed with calling with making good rhymes to becoming an R&B; singer. So basically he would rather make more money doing something he sucks at than keeping the respect of his fans with his real style? LOL
1,No good,"I fully realize that what I am about to say might fly over your head, but here goes:Ja Rule, and those of his ilk, are the primary reason why our country is turning into a haven for immoral beings, illegal immigrants, and criminals. Ja brags about drugs, violence and robberies which are three of the things that are destroying the moral and social order of our society. You will find that the lifestyle that Ja promotes primarily exists within the black urban neighborhoods (ghettos) that have poisened our nation. Is this simply a coincidence or is there something deeper going on here? I opine that the lifestyle that Ja promotes and brags about is unique to the black urban poor because they have certain violent tendencies embedded in their genes. Sorry, but the truth hurts."
5,Ja Rule Is Back!,"The first time I bought a Ja Rule CD, it was ""The Last Temptation"". It was the worst CD I've ever heard, and this cd (R.U.L.E.), along with ""Blood In My Eye"", beats the hell out ""The Last Temptation"". I think everyone should go out and buy this CD because it isn't too bad. I know a lot of people hate on him because of 50 Cent, and I agree, I don't like him either, but this CD is worth your money. Love, Peace, and God Bless!"
5,RULE is back THE INC is back,this album is hot. RULE's at his best. the album has songs for the ladies and gentlmen. this my favorite album this year the beats the lyrics are nice. rule is my favorite and always will be my favorite rapper. and to all those ppl who say rule isnt this and that. you dont know what your missing. what im say buy it its worth it.The inc isnt going anywhere for a long time ja not going anywhere.
4,Ja's Back with That Fire for sure,"yeah this new ja is overall pretty tight i mean the beats are all cool except for whats my name and get it started kinda lack a little to me but the rest is cool and his lyrics are pretty deep too but not as much as the Venni Vetti album but still is a cool album through it all and you could tell he handled all his beefs like a true soldier and a quiet man if u feel what i mean, he kinda doesn't speak about them on this album anymore but u can tell he handled them properly and quietly. Album is dope you should definately get it, Best songs to me are Last of the Mohicans, R.U.L.E.,Life goes On,Where I'm From & Passion. Get that. Holla!!"
2,average,"""wonderful"" with R.kelly on the Hook is the Only reason why I even really gave this Album half the time of day.Ja Rule had the Duet Game on Lock until He switched up after that whole thing with 50 Cent&He lost His vibe. this album pretty much follows His past Blueprint. but Ja Rule is just hanging on now.aside from ""Wonderful"" there really isn't much else that grabs me.Production is decent but you are hearing a Cat who is just going through the Music Motions."
2,Ja rule needs to stop writing his own review on his cds.,"I seen alot of just one reviews in every ja album and im pretty much nuggaz from murda inc or ja are doing that and they need to stop dat...Coz it ain gone help hiz corny azz. Ja rule's ""R.U.L.E."" is a boring and wack album wid stupid lirycs as well as the dumb single ny which makes me feel ashamed of ny evne tho im from ny. Yo, ja if you readin diz? Stop tryin to make every one be yo friend homie , ight? Just stop it. Except people to hate you and why get so offend coz eminem & 50 dissed you? [...]"
1,SAME OLD BS,Like I said same old BS. I aside from the whole 50 things. He is nothing special and neither is this album.
1,Terrible!,I'm a CPG brand manager in the cosmetic business and was very disappointed with this publication. It does not contain any valuable information. The majority of the magazine is images of people at various industry events. Waste of money.
3,Disappointed in Michigan,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Most of the items are photographed in back and white and in large groups, which makes it nearly impossible to identify items using these photos as references. I wouldn't recommend it for identification purposes."
1,Someone was drunk,Do they hate Roxy Music that much? No need to waste my words and your money on that sick joke.
1,i am ashamed for this c.d.,"I just heard only a few seconds of 'both ends burning' online of this monstrosity and i couldn;t handle anymore! it was just crap! i've never heard of anyone doing a tribute album to roxy music and bryan ferry, but i now i know why: ya just don't!!!! if you're considering to even buy this for a 'back in the c.d. rack' kinda a business, you're wasting your time and money!"
5,Great album!,"I am a 35 year old mother of 2 and I love this album! My kids love it and I love ""We've Only Just Begun"" The video cracks me up, and I just love to listen to this album. Housekeeping and workouts go by fast with these tunes. Reminds me of the Outfield (a little) from the 80's. I hope these guys are totally famous someday soon. LOVE IT!"
4,Great CD,"I really like the cd. I knew a few songs before I bought it and the others are catchy. ""We've Only Just Begun"" is amazing and the reason I purchased it in the first place."
2,"Uninspired, but it will pass for soccer moms and their young kids.","First off, I have no problem with christian music. I am a huge fan of a lot of it. (Underoath, He is Legend, Showbread, As I Lay Dying) But this stuff is so incredibly uninspired, it's sad. They sound like a christian knock-off of Fall Out Boy. The first track sounded EXACTLY like FOB. Don't buy this unless you want a knock-off. Don't buy FOB's records, either. Cuz they suck as well. Total garbage. Go listen to original music. Like The Faint, or older Project 86.God bless,Jake"
2,Disappointing,"When I picked this cd up at my local Christian bookstore, I had heard very few of Run Kid Run's songs. As I started to listen to the cd, I was expecting to be surprized by how good they were. As it was, I was slightly disappointed. This band is nothing new. They combine Relient K's music with vocals from Green Day, Hawk Nelson, Olivia the Band and Relient K. That's it. All of the songs sound the same, and nothing stands out. The one song I like Is Wake Up, Get Out. Over all, This Is Who We Are is not worth the 14 bucks I paid for it."
3,Good reference addition to home library,A good book with some nice case studies. Not a bad addition to my reference library. I'm giving it 3 stars only because a good 1/4 of the featured homes are not that great and seemed out of place in this book.
2,its ok but not worth the money,"It looks cool but we haven't really had reason to use it much.The burner is really affected by wind. I tried to stir-fry on it and the wok didn't even get hot after 20 minutes because it was a little windy out. If I could do it again, I would not get it.The summit 650 grill is great though!"
1,Stale.,I ordered this product and half the bag was rock hard and the other half were still tough. Really disappointed.
5,Great Value and Product,"As a huge twizzler fan, it was fantastic to find these in bulk and for an extremely fair price. My concern was that they would be stale or hardened when I received them, but this was not the case, and they were fresh and soft. Very reasonable price, much less expensive than any store."
2,More expensive than Costco or Walmart--FYI,"I love Twizzlers and ordered this without comparing prices. Costco and Walmart were significantly cheaper--FYI.If you aren't familiar with Twizzlers, they are red, sweet and delicious."
4,"""Take A Look""","""Take a Look"", like Natalie Cole's other C.D.'s ""Unforgettable"" and ""Stardust"" has taken treasured songs and has given them a whole new life. Natalie sings her songs with grace and elegance, and has opened a whole new interest to me in music of the 40-50's. The C.D. has a perfect blend of music, from soft and beautiful songs to snappy upbeat jazz tunes. Anyone who enjoys jazz of the 40-50's should definately add this C.D. to their collection."
4,For fans of sophisticated jazz stylings,"""Take A Look"" (1993) follows ""Unforgettable,"" Cole's unforgettable tribute to her father's legacy, and is overall an artistic triumph. In many ways ""Take A Look"" is much riskier a program in that Cole interprets some lesser-known standards in the same jazz/big band/swing styles as its predecessor. Cohesively, it is not as tight a program but it succeeds in its own right. For fans of sophisticated jazz singing."
4,"A ""Listen,"" as well as a ""look""","Cole scores with this subtle excursion into pop and jazz. She shows again why she is definitely the progeny of her late, great father. She is one of the few contemporary artists that can consistently produce outstanding music."
2,Great back up band,"The back up band on this album does a great job. Truly top-notch.Natalie Cole sounds like a pop star trying to sing jazz.She sings all the notes and the words. She even sings with some expression. She is obviously very talented.However, she often fails pay attention to phrase structure in the songs. Her tone quality is inconsistent and sometimes grating. The results are flat and uninspiring. If you want to listen to some contemporary jazz/pop vocalists you'd do better to listen Diana Krall, Kristin Korb, or Harry Connick, Jr. At the time this was recorded, Ms. Cole just wasn't ready to do a jazz album."
5,"A Wonderful Collection: Real People, Real Funny","THE LEMON TABLE by Julian Barnes is a immensely enjoyable collection of short stories. The vast majority of these tales display Barnes' plentiful and deliciously wicked wit. For me the connection to these pieces was a result of his knack for expertly crafted characters with very real reactions to very real (and sometimes mundane) situations. Filled with delightful idiosyncrasies and true genuineness, these folks truly (pardon the cliche) come alive on the page. Themactically THE LEMON TABLE primarily concerns time, love, death and the intertwining of the three. Hence the book's title...""Among the Chinese the lemon is the symbol of death"". This is the work of a jolly master craftsman whose concise (and quite often inventive) wording, narrative eye, and use of voice make it all seem soooo easy. Bravo!"
3,"Disappointing after ""Sense of an Ending""","Some of the stories were quite good, but for me some got a little tedious. Bought this after reading Sense of an Ending, which I really liked, so this disappointed me somewhat."
1,Lemon Table,LOVED Nothing to be Frightened of and was looking for more books by Julian Barnes. I found this one vulgar and only marginally entertaining.
5,Good product. Seller is very accomodating,"We ordered 8 mouldings and although the shipment took about 6 weeks, the wait was well worth the end product. With oak, the wood was not bowed and fit our purpose of attaching to a book case."
4,highly entertaining history,"in reply to the claim that Tabari is almost as blasphemous as Rushdie, Professor Mohja Kahf drily remarked that its no surprise, since both are writers of fiction! Any historian who writes a couple of hundred years after the event and reports dialogue, witticisms and even facial expressions is obviously writing a lot of fiction, but fiction or not, its high drama, presented in vivid detail. one of these days, someone should do a translation without the long lists of ""who reported to whom"" (the isnad) because they do take away from the flow of the book. Tabari also makes no attempt at social analysis and has little to say about what the ""common people"" might have been doing and why, but his history is one of the prime sources for all the famous stories of islamic history and one can see why. well worth a read...."
5,One of my most go-to cookbooks,"I first saw this cookbook on my mother's shelf in her Texas home. Since I lived in Tennessee, I flipped through. I had hopes mother would give it to me but she insisted that I get my own. I found on Amazon, the book was in excellent condition and I use it when I want to cook many traditional dishes. The photographs add so much to the history of the traditions."
4,Easy to read and provide good insights to new owners,"The author describes what a family entrepreneur needs to know in order to run a successful family business. The autor also highlights three major management functions - communication, cooperation and control for a family business owner such as how to evaluate relatives in a family business. It is practical and valuable because small family business owners may not know how to handle such situations effectively. After reading this book, it helps me to understand how to manage my family business practically. In the last two chapters the author also address the problems of succession and retirement that I haven't thought before. Anyway, I recommend this book to those people to plan or just started his or her small family business."
4,Great product,"This is a great product! It took me forever to find a photo album that held this many pictures. The quality of the product is great, however the way that it was packaged was a problem. I ordered 3 albums and they all came in the same box. When the albums were put in the box, 2 of the albums were facing each other which caused the metal to scratch. For the amount that I paid for these, I was not happy. I would definately buy these again. However, next time I would just make sure that they package them correctly."
2,Smaller than Advertised,"The tent felt much smaller & tighter than it's stated dimensions. When assembled, the shape looked a bit odd & assymetrical. Also, it doesn't have that heavy duty, waterproof plastic bottom. Overall, not too impressed with the product."
2,"Technically sound, otherwise weak-sauce","This movie had a nice idea: never show the monster. It also has a few nice visual effects, decent cinematography, and overall decent acting. The boys felt a little uncomfortable around eachother (maybe they needed more practice to better portray a group of friends?) but this wasn't too bad. I think the big problem here was time; this movie had only 16 minutes to introduce the characters, unleash the monster, and kill the characters, and that's just not enough time to effectively build the sort of presence that an unseen monster really needs to be scary. This probably would have played better with just two characters fighting to survive as the evil darkness slowly, but surely closes in for the kill.As it is, the movie is not scary, not very intersting, and really only worth watching if you're a horror writer looking to learn more about what does and doesn't work in a horror film. Anybody else: steer clear - this movie is 16 minutes of life you cannot get back."
1,Do not bother,"This movie was a total waist of time. The actors need to do more work on their skills. You will never see them in a major motion film. The story was weak an lame. Can someone tell me can you give no stars, I gave one because I thought that was the lowest. Amazon should refund everyones money back that paid for this."
4,"Amazing, is ""HER GRACE""...","The book is enlightening and endearing...compassionate and loving...soo much to be amazed at when taking in this story....If you were a sceptic before reading this book, it's revelation(s) shall set you straight. If you believe, you do receive. It is that simple. A MUST READ FOR ONE ANYONE EMPOWERED BY WOMEN, especially, OUR BLESSED MOTHER, THE VIRGIN MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS...a wonderful and loving book...all the way through."
1,No Terry Don West,I purchased this DVD to watch Terry Don West ride bulls. I thought it was a video of his actual bull rides. What I got was a bunch of people I didn't know riding bulls and then some videos of the worlds toughest bulls. One short interview with TDW and that was it. No videos of TDW. So in that regard I am disappointed.Mike
4,Has an amazing start... but then kinda dies...,"This is the only album by this group I've ever listened to, so I can't judge it against previous efforts. The first half of the album is quite amazing, but it felt like it died after that into that low-beat mellowness I like to call BrainDead music--the kind that sort of fades into the background and nobody really hears.Overall, though, a worthy purchase. The first half of the album more than makes up for the slow second half."
2,Seems like a different set,"After seeing the butterfly cups, I really thought the saucers would be just as nice. They don't even look like they are out of the same set."
3,need dvd,tracking and colors a little off. needs to be released on dvd. but the video was worth it. maybe one day.
5,Way to Go Margaret,I just want to say again what a useful book this is! I've had coaching clients who have worked with Margaret to help them figure out their passions and what I love most is the permission to love lots of things. What a relief to also have some ideas on how to move forward and choose what to work on when. That idea alone is worth the price of the book.
2,The new slower sound,John Bush isn't really a big competition to Joey Belladonna.This is where The greatest thrash band ever changes their fast sound to a much more slower one.
1,???,"This Album came out i was so disapointed no Joey it was hard to get used to John Bush it never grew in me, then i saw them live and John Singing classics killed my mood... buy Joey Era stuff its better than this piece of crap"
4,arguably anthraxs' best album to date,"This indeed reflects a mature band. 1993, the guys arent 23 years old anymore. No band can put out album after album that features 250 beats per minute thrash songs throughout. That coupled with the fact that drummer Charlie Benante's wife cheated on him which in turn resulted in him comprising 90% of this albums material, is at least inspiring."
1,Should've changed the band's name,"I was a huge Anthrax fan growing up. I was a little distrought over the band's loss of Joey Belladonna, but figured the new guy might be ok... after all Maiden's changed singers and I've still enjoyed the music. This album came out during that whole ""grunge era"" where a lot of bands lost their roots and tried to change their sound to appeal to the alternative crowd. Big mistake. I listened to this album 3 times trying to like it... never happened.I sold it for 2 bucks soon after buying it. This is not the same band who brought us ""Among the Living"" and ""State of Euphoria."" Something good did come from the band's split. I checked out Belladonna the lead singer's self titled album... it's still in my cd changer. Want Anthrax? Try something from before 1993."
1,What's with all the good reviews?,"This is where the band as well as most 80's bands began to commercialize their sound. This is rock music.. plain and simple and this has nothing to make this considered metal. Sorry, but I don't see what the fuss is about...this CD sucked. Anthrax with Joey Belladonna is where the band really shined and was real metal. Yeah, I admit the whole rap thing sucked horribly but still for the most part Anthrax was truly heavy band with Joey but with John...they really slowed down."
4,Cheap and good,"I purchased this at a Amazon Friday sale price, and this is clearly a inexpensive product, yet it is similar enough to higher price ones in quality.While the outer cardboard box did not spell ""Crown"" correctly, the stapler, staples, and case are good quality for a home re modeler.Since I have had no problems with this tool, I recommend this to others."
3,It's okay,"I was looking for a book with easy harp Disney songs. This isn't it. Also there are mostly OLD Disney songs, so not great for the current harp student who doesn't find The Jungle book and The Aristocats interesting."
1,Yawn,"This book would have been a lot more interesting if it included reproductions of every survey.As I said before, A monkey could have compiled these lists."
5,Rhetoric for Dummies,I think this is one of the best books on public speaking I have ever read. It is clear and concise. The author lays out what you are to know and do very well. I would recommend Ad Herennium to anyone. I am really glad my 10th grade Rhetoric teacher made me read this!!!
5,Spanish Heavy Metal-Rap-Hip Hop Fusion,"If you like groups like Puya (Puerto Rico), Molotov (Mexico), Control Machete (Mexico), etc. Then you will love Resorte. This CD will gave you a Fusion of Heavy Metal with Rap and some Hip Hop."
1,Are you willing to wait 2 months to get this?,"This could not have taken any longer to arrive if it came from Russia. I'm not sure it they are using the same vendor but if it is, don't buy it. It really took about two months! I ordered this and another item and they both took forever. I later realized it was the same vendor. If you do not see any tracking within a few days just forget it and go to the store! I have since bought another brand and it is helps but it does not always work for me."
5,"great as always! good for stress, too.","I've reviewed this product before, and I use it for sleep after going to rehab for alcohol and drugs (all of them). I am also finding it useful here at a writer's retreat. It seems to counteract the social anxiety I assume I got from my use of narcotics. I love this stuff!"
4,Works good for mild anxiety,"This product is great for mild anxiety, been taking it for a few weeks now and have noticed a lot of improvement especially in the workplace enviornment. This helps you maintain a calm attitude, and takes the nervousness out of situations. It does take about an hour or so for the effect to kick in, but after that you should be good for at least 3-4 hrs. Not sure how it would perform with extreme anxiety, but for everyday situations it works well."
3,It's a supplement,"It's supposed to help you to sleep. Really? This supplement did absolutely nothing to help me to sleep. Maybe it helps others, but not me."
2,Sorry -but didn't work,I bought this product for my husband. He told me it didn't work any better anything else. We won't be purchasing this preoduct again. I do hope it works for other people.
1,Did not work and smells terrible.,"I read in Men's Health that this was supposed to be clinically proven to assist in sleep so I thought I would try it out. I have not felt/observed any assistance in falling or staying asleep with Valerian Root. That is not to say this product can't work for you. Every body is different, of course. The lack of effectiveness alone would cause me to give it about 3 stars. However, the smell of this product makes me give it 1 star. I mean this as literally as it sounds. This product smells like feces. There is no other way I could describe it. If you do purchase this product, have a separate cabinet to place it in or put the bottle in a ziploc bag. Wish I could have a better review."
2,Not working well for me the way it should,"I took 3 capsules like it says to do, at 11PM. It is now 4:am and I have not yet slept. I did notice a slight happier feeling, I think, unless it's just my mood or placebo effect, but I feel a bit giggly, warm and happy after taking these. It is true what they say, these things smell pretty bad but it's even worse if you're like me and open the capsules to eat the powder.I have an irrational worry that the capsule won't fully digest, so I remove the contents and eat it that way. It tastes like horse manure mixed with sand (I think the sandy bit is calcium, but, who knows maybe it is really sand!)so in summary; it lightened my mood, and my wallet but didn't get me to sleep but everyone is different, I'd rather have tried it and have it fail than not tried it if it may have worked, if you know what I mean."
3,Sort of Works,"This was recommended to me by my physician to help me sleep as an alternative to prescription meds. While I feel it helps, it is hard to get past the smell of the product!"
5,Great to help relax and sleep!!!,"Read reviews thought I would try and let me tell you it works great!! Suggests 3 capsules before bed, yikes!! I just take one, and it does the job, make sure to take a couple of hours before going to bed so you dont wake up groggy, but I love the stuff. Dont need it every night but when I do it works!"
3,Does not have the same effect on everyone,I read many of the reviews and watched Dr. Oz-- I was hoping Valerian would be a natural way to help me fall asleep faster. Apparently I am one of those people that sees the opposite effect-- both nights I tried it I either took forever to fall asleep or woke up in the middle of the night and could not go back to sleep. A good product but unfortunately does not work for everyone.
4,Does the trick...,"... but I wish these did not have that awful smell! I admit, I have tried other brands, and ALL of them smell, so that is an unfair complaint. I trust Nature's Way products and find them consistently high quality (i.e., the recommended dose does the job)."
4,Blood pressure management,"Drops my blood pressure (SBP and DBP) by 10 points, I take it in the morning to help with daily stressors and keep BP under control."
3,1 out of 2 kitties recommends the Kuddler,"I got this Kuddler when I had only one cat. She ignored it. I tried turning it into the alternative tunnel, thinking she'd like to climb inside as much as she does with boxes and bags. No go. So it went the way of all rejected cat items --- in the corner of the closet, waiting for me to find it a home. I myself forgot about it.Enter cat number 2. He's an old fellow, adopted from the shelter. I had to get his long white fur shaved because of the matts. He discovered the Kitty Kuddler.He loves it. I guess it keeps his old bones warm. His fur has grown back but he still sleeps in it --- every night.The only problem he has is that it does not have a rigid bottom and tips over easily."
1,very small and not too soft,Our kitten is 5 months old and our apartment is very drafty so we thought this bed would be a good idea. He's pretty stubborn and it takes him awhile to accept anything new but he really does not like this bed at all. The material is kind of scratchy and the stitching is not very well done. It really may just be that our cat doesn't like it. If we put him in it while he's sleeping sometimes he will stay in it but he's going to outgrow it very soon. If you do get this make sure it is for a relatively small cat or kitten or plan to be getting a new one when they outgrow or destroy it.
1,Thank goodness for Nia and Toni,"Perhaps I expected something less juvenile and predicatable. I did not utter so much as a giggle throughout this film. The only emotions I experienced were utter embarrassment for all the principals and admiration for Vardalos and Collette for being able to make anything of the picture, and perhaps for having the nerve to appear in it at all. Well, Nia wrote the thing so I suppose it was Toni alone who really stepped up to the plate. She could read the phone book and make it theater, but even SHE could not make me believe that she'd ever be mistaken for a drag queen. But really, why...why on earth was this picture made? Characters are totally formulaic and unbelievable. Writing seems geared toward a 15-year-old audience. Michael Lembeck's directorial style is TV-sitcom all the way. The laughs are cheap and the dialogue's feeble. But still, Vardalos and Collette light up the screen even in this worst of all possible comedies, so that's something."
5,I Laughed 'til I Cried!!!,"I am a total movie geek and am always on the look out for the ""keeper""! This movie was it. I watched it twice back to back and then went out to buy it. It's a silly, laugh-out-loud movie that makes me smile just to think about it. The musical numbers were great and I loved all the puns that were tossed around. If you're looking for an intellectual, high brow movie, this isn't it but if you want to kick back and forget about all the horror around you and just laugh until you cry try ""Connie and Carla"". You won't be disappointed."
5,The Birdcage Meets Thelma and Louise,"This is one of my mother and my favorite movies. It stars two great (my favorite) actresses who really bring the characters to life. If your in need of a serious laugh then this movie is one for the books. It's a little cheesy and predictable at times but who doesn't like some mild cheddar now and then. I liken this movie to the spawn of two movies, The Birdcage and Thelma and Louise."
1,Boogie Wonderland,"""Connie and Carla"" is so far removed from anything real that it begs description. It's neither pro-gay or anti nor pro-straight or anti. It's set in a world that doesn't exist nor will ever exist. It's a fantasy without being fantastic: it's a parody without humor. It's a dud.It's only saving grace is the humanity of the performances of Nia Vardalos and Toni Colette who both should have known better."
1,This Movie Blows Chunks,THis is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was expecting a LOT more from Nia! I do not recomend this movie!
1,too good to be true,I thought what a great bargain I found this movie I totally loved. but when i got the product it could be watched on my Blu-Ray Dvd player as it was made for another region. The company should notify you when your ordering that it won't work on american blu-players as it is made for another region. Which this is the first time I heard about not being able to watch a movie cause what region it is from. The site should explain about why there movies don't work on USA dvd players.
5,its a drag... pun intended!,"connie and carla is a fun comedy about two lime light addicted ladies on the run. in order to hide they flee to la and its no exsitent dinner theater scene. unable to be out of the lime light for two long, the ladies join a failing drag show. with a little talent, love and alot of hair they get their lives back on track until... well i wont say much more but you get the idea. i recomend this movie for anyone who loves music, drag queens, comedy and drama... lots of drama."
3,"I wanted to hate it, but ...","On principle, I wanted to hate this movie. I'm really tired of movies or television shows that exploit the gay community, depicting all gay men as cartoonish drama queens obsessed with superficial things, while dubiously preaching ""tolerance"". And in terms of the story, it's derivative and borrows from a slew of other movies including (but not limited to) ""Sister Act"", ""To Wong Foo"", ""Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion"" and even ""Thelma and Louise"". But there was something about this movie that made it impossible for me to hate it. Perhaps it was the sincerity of all the lead performances. Or the love of music that permeates every aspect of the film. Or maybe it's just that Toni Collette is so amazing that she can make anything watchable. In any case, for all its flaws, ""Connie and Carla"" was amusing and enjoyable enough to watch once. But I don't plan on any repeat viewings."
5,LMAO,I have NOT laughed SO hard at a movie in YEARS! This movie is SO funny you had better bring a box of tissues with you when you watch it! GREAT performances by all! A MUST SEE!
5,Nia Rocks,"I can honestly say, most of today's comedies fall flat with me. However, 'Connie and Carla' was a pleasant surprise. It's hilarious. Nia Vardalos is a top-notch talent. She's a comedic genus that is just beginning to receive the acclaim she deserves. She's an excellent writer and I think she would also do well as a stand-up comic. And despite the lack-luster sales of `Connie and Carla' (especially compared to her romantic comedy box office giant `My Big Fat Greek Wedding'), this movie certainly won't disappoint. I just hope Nia continues in her success-and gets pregnant like she wants to-I'm certain that new chapter of her life will bring some lively and comedic tales. Bottom line: this DVD is well worth the buy. Keep the family out of the bathroom, you'll be laughing so hard, you might need it."
4,"Good natured, sweet, recycled comedy","Some Like it Hot, Victor/Victoria, The Birdcage, Priscilla ... yes, been there done that. There is still something so good natured about this comedy that it has an infectious charm and good will about it. Vardalos is fine, Colette is amazing and quite funny in her make-up, Duchovny is charming as the dope in the middle of it all. This one packs some laughs, goofy musical performances and a not preachy tolerance message into one enjoyably harmless package. Definitely worth a look."
4,20 years too late - or 30 years too early?,"The Washington Squares transplanted Eisenhower/JFK-era folk into the Regan/Thatcher era. Sadly, it failed to take. The material and artistry were certainly there, but they never achieved the attention they deserved in the era of MTV bands. Like much art, it's easier to appreciate in hindsight. It is nice to see that (most of) their two albums are still available.I was disappointed to notice that two powerful tracks from the original Fair and Square album seem to have been ...redacted... from the currently available versions: a powerful cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Everybody Knows"" and ""Pride of Man"". Even in its diminished version, this is a great album with strong performances and solid songs. It strikes me as equal parts sardonic nod to the earnest folk music of the late 50s/early 60s and sincere attempt to resurrect the passion of the genre with a post-punk sensibility."
4,Product meets expectations,"Nice side grips, thick quality metal. They looked like stainless cookware and I bought them anticipating that, but they're actually coated non-stick. Anyone with a pet bird knows to avoid this in cookware, so I was disappointed by this fact when I took them out of the box. No fault with the construction though."
4,good book,"Good book! It needed to be about 5 or 6 chapters longer, it just felt as though it was missing some depth to the charactors and he could have expanded some about the situations of the people that were on Thorin. Overall, it's a good solid book that sets the story for MANY more novels to come covering the FEDCOM civil war."
1,Ipod cord overheats!!,Just installed the USA SPEC PA11-HON iPod Interface and in about 10 minutes the I pod cord started to overheat. Not sure if I got a defective cord or what?? I will contact the distributor ( car toys) to see what they suggest.Thought everyone should know.
2,Stopped Working after 4 months,"No real issues installing it, pretty straight forward. Worked nice, problem is it just stopped working after 4 months. No doubt just after the 90 days. Would not recommend it. Will spend the extra money and purchase the product from an authorized dealer."
1,We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.,"Pros: Easy install. Worked as advertised (steering wheel controls on our 1999 Honda Odyssey worked too) for a short time.Cons: It's Junk! Our first unit stopped working during 2nd month of use before big road trip. The Amazon seller is not USA Spec authorized retailer, so I had to send it back to the seller for exchange, which took some time. Then the second unit stopped working within first month. A little expensive for a POS."
2,Disappointing.,"How nice it was to reconnect with Peekay again! The first 200 or so pages were terrific Power of One prose. Then, the story seemed to accelerate out of control, and all the pieces ceased to connect and complete the intended circuit. There were a number of items that were significant, yet unexplained in the story. Like - what happened to Harriet? - to the camera? - to Hercules? - how did Mambo's teeth end up on a necklace on that Tandia wore? to what happpened to Hymie for heavens sake? Sorry, this one just didn't dance to the same beat as the Power of One."
2,Disappointment,"I didn't know this book existed until three years after I read the Power of One, one of my favorite books. I had trouble getting it since it is out of print but I finally got a copy. I took off work to read it. Although it satisfied my desire to know what happend to Peekay it was substandard compared to TPOO. I would've prefered a paragraph synopsis describing what happened to the principles at the end of TPOO to Tandia. It was poorly written and did not have the storytelling feel of TPOO. Characters were underdeveloped and you didn't feel like you knew Peekay as in TPOO. They also changed Morrie's name and never explained WHY! It was a long book and would've been longer if it had been done right. As much as dreamed of a TPOO sequel, I think I would've preffered to go on not knowing than read Tandia."
4,Wonderlik!,"I loved the book. The language is powerful. However, the one point that irks me is the reverse hatred of Boers shown by Peekay. It is a book of tit for tat. Peekay is more Boer than English than he knows."
3,"Great book, but the kindle version disappointed....","I read the Power of One and Tandia when I was in High School and loved them both. I have my own copies of these books and have re-read them periodically over the years. So when I got my kindle, I also bought the kindle versions.The books are still great, but I noticed that at least three parts of Tandia were missing from the kindle version. And not tiny insignificant details, either. There was the part after Peekay had broken his wrist after his first attempt at the world title when he revisits the crystal cave of Africa and encounters the black mamba. And the whole part of what happened to Magistrate Coetzee's farmhouse.The book definitely loses something without these parts and I can't help but feel a tad ripped off."
2,Badly flawed,"The Power of One, to which Tandia is the sequel, is flawed, but absolutely beautiful. Tandia is just flawed. A real disappointment, Mr. Courtenay."
1,Yuck - I threw Tandia away,"The Power of One was one of my favorite books this year and I was eager to read the sequel, Tandia. But after the first, then the second brutal rape scene within the first 50 pages, I just threw it in the trash. I loved living in the author's imagination when he created Peekay, but I couldn't escape his world fast enough when he created poor Tandia."
1,Absoloodle Shame!,"Power of One is a masterpiece! A treasure gift to be shared with family, friends, business associates.I had sent to Australia for Tandia and all Courtenay's books before they were available here.Tandia is material for fire place at best. A brutal clone gone wrong of Power of One. Bryce Courtenay on real bad drugs.His brilliance in his other books are found gold, warm sweet potatoes! Power of One should be required reading for schools throughout the globe. Tandia is nothing more than a Harold Robbins imitation that doesn't cut it. Absoloodle!"
2,Highly disappointing,"I really did not enjoy this book. It was such a let down after the Power of One.I thought Tandia was a weak, uninteresting character. Fortunately Peekay was the same as ever. I found that I was already up to page 200 and the story had berely even begun. I was bored through most of the book.Although it was brilliantly written as all Bryce Courtenay books are, I thought the plot was very unsatisfying. However, I really enjoyed Peekay's title fight and most of the other bits about Peekay. It was just Tandia who was boring and I often found myself skipping chapters.I did think that the end was fitting, it was the right way to die. If there is a sequel, I hope it turns out better than this one."
2,I hate this book.,"I hate Bryce Courtney. I hate the way he ruins a decent and heart felt book, by a second rate follow up, a marketing scheme to milk more money from poor readers who would be better off not reading his books, or getting them from the Library. I loved the Power Of One, even though I read it and this so long ago, I still remember the satisfaction of finishing it, and how warming and rich the story was. But no, Bryce couldn't leave it at that, and had to write a follow up, which was only a fifth as good as the first, thereby leaving me disliking The Power of One a little. Did this book strike anyone as a little indecent? I have no problems with sex in art, books, movies etc, but for some reason, when Bryce decribes it, it feels a little dirty. Perhaps this was the one reason I did not enjoy this book. I am sorry to burst any Bryce bubbles here, but the man is far from a genius, and is neither remotely interesting or slightly amusing. Read the Power of One, and stop there."
3,Not a must-read,"I hunted this book for years, and was disappointed. For those who witnessed the magic of Peekay and Africa in ""The Power of One"", leave this one in the bushveld. I wish I could've read it just for the boxing parts in Peekay's struggle for the world title (and I am not a sports fan)."
3,Tandia,"After reading ""The Power of One"" I began reading everything by this author. ""Tandia"" is not one of my favorites, quite a let down after ""Power"", and not truly what I would consider a sequel. Many of his others are better."
2,disappointed,"half way through the book and I think I'm going to just drop it. Bought it because I loved Power of one. But I am bored... not grabbing me and too much description of uninteresting things, at least uninteresting to me."
3,"Good, not great","I had high hopes for Tandia, as I'm sure every reader of Power of One did. While entertaining and well written, it just didn't grab me as I wanted it to. I was disappointed when I finished it, as my expectations got in the way. Now that time has passed since I read it, I realize that it was a good book with well developed characters and it flowed very well. I enjoyed Potato Factory more than Tandia and nothing is as good as Power of One."
2,Uncomfortable for the wrong reasons,"I enjoyed the Power of One and went to the trouble of getting Tandia shipped across the Atlantic to check out Courtenay's sequel -- a mistake both in terms of time and money spent. The beatification of Peekay in this second book renders him wholly un-appealing and in-human. The need of the author to stuff the book with historical context may be valued by high-school history classes but served in my eyes to completely obscure whatever flow the story might otherwise have managed. Tandia herself is poorly served not only by her fictional circumstances but also by the neglect of Courtenay who leaves her vastly under-developed. In sum - I did not enjoy my reading of the book and, even worse, was so distracted by the discomfort that the lessons to be learned from the South African situation were lost to me during the read."
1,So Disappointed,"I loved the Power of One. It has always been one of my favorite books. I was so excited to learn there was a sequel. Wow, what a let down. I wonder if it was even written by the same author? It had no life or spirit...or the humor that made the Power of One so compelling and entertaining. Close to the end I began skipping in order to get to the end. I wish he had left this too long and often boring book unwrittten."
4,Tandia,Another excellent book by Bryce Courtney. I enjoy they way he weaves together the lives of the characters from various books.
4,Tandia,"This was an amazing book written about South Africa. This is about politics and hatred during the time of oppression in South Africa. It is well written and talks a lot about black/white issues, issues we've never had to define in this country of United States. I would recommend it."
5,great book,"This was a great sequel to ""Power of One"". A little long, perhaps, with some repetition, but powerful, nonetheless. Makes me feel so fortunate to live in a free country."
4,Coping With Agressive Behavior,"The product was what I expected, a tool to help cope with aggressive behavoir within the school system. I highly recommend this book a a reference tool."
4,"Very tiny diamond, but still nice!",Keep in mind that 1/10 carat is VERY tiny!I still like this necklace even though it's tinier than what I thought. It's very pretty and the diamond still sparkles.My one negative comment is that the tiny clasp makes the necklace difficult to put on.
1,Get what you pay for,"Teeny Tiny, with one of those chains that is so thin that it gets tied up in knots if you so much as look at it.I returned it.Mairead"
3,Does a mother really act like this?,"I have met women who give up their children but that does not mean I want to read about it. This is the last book of the Stewart sisters I read and my least favorite. No reflection on Joan Johnston because she is a fantastic writer but I really didn't like Sloan and feel she did not deserve Cruz. But in the end, it all came about."
4,Loved it...Absolutely Loved it!,"Very breathtaking and romantic story...I was totally absorbed in the long awaited story of Sloan Stewart, who was a very assertive and headstrong character, but yet passionate and loving at the same time. The sex scenes between her and Cruz really blew me away...once again Ms. Johnston has written herself a winner!"
4,Texas Woman,I loved this book. I've enjoyed reading Joan Johnsston for years and plan to read more books as I find them. Her Trilogy Books never disappoint me about individual family members and friends and I will enojy reading more of them by my favorite authors.
3,OK,Not the best one in the series; but it was still ok. Not all of the books in this series are on Kindle so I if it's not available through Kindle I don't read it.
5,Great New British Group,This band totally rocks! The music makes me want to jump out of my chair and dance! Expect this band to be around for a while.
5,Remaster is amazing,"I have always thought this to be one of the great rock albums, so I bought this remastered version actually thinking it was an SACD (I thought Sony's DSD was the same: silly me). It is not, however, an SACD. What it is undoubtedly, however: an unbelievably better recording than the original CD pressing. Cleaner, clearer, less distorted, more dynamic, greater tonal accuracy. Balance better, no boom in the bass. In short, a demonstration class rock recording of a still unbelievable album. The quality of the playing makes every single modern day popular group seem like the complete bunch of amateurs they are. This is playing that any professional in any field of music can admire. Jeff Porcaro's last album, I do believe; and even if you are not a drumming fiend, you will have to admit this guy was something else. Anyhow, don't hesitate. If you have the original version buy this anyway and give the other one to a friend. I did!"
4,"big sound, little button","Works like a powerful bell, not easy to hang up, I have it standing on the top of a shelf."
3,"Doorbell came on time and was as described, except that the battery in the button part of the doorbell was dead and I had to pur","Doorbell came on time and was as described, except that the battery in the button part of the doorbell was dead and I had to purchase another battery before I could install it."
3,Only for the die hard.,"Quite simplly, this maxi single is for the collector or the die hard fan. If you love this song, I highly suggest spending the extra 20 and buying the import collection that they have which contains quite a bit of hits as well as a good lump of remixes for those who care."
3,Lesser Wayne Vehicle,"In one of his lesser starring efforts, John Wayne plays the leader of a construction company that goes on to help form the Fighting Seabees, an armed group of workers. Prior to the Seabees, the construction crews building air strips and other military installations weren't allowed to carry arms. Wayne is stubborn and determined to say the least, and he pushes to have his men armed for battle as they work on curiously named islands in the Pacific during the Second World War. The film's focus is torn between the establishment of the Seabees and Wayne's romance with journalist Susan Hayward. Neither plotline is developed enough, and considering that it appears to be a war film, there's not much to the fighting in the film. It's not a bad film, but it suffers from a low budget and a script that needed much more work. However, there is a rare chance in this film to Big John jitterbug, which is good for a laugh."
3,"Three-and-a-half stars for this very fine John Wayne WWII pic, 50th anniversary at that.","John Wayne plays Wedge Donovan (acharacter name he would use 19 yrs.,later in 1963's Donovan's Reef), aconstruction Engineering magnate whoends up selling the US Navy on armingcivilian personnel in hot LZs! He doesget killed in here (like in 'The Cow-boys' - **.5)but his movie was way bet-ter! Enough referrences to'japs', 'mon-kies', et, al and other racial epithe-ts to turn off the 'politically stupid'types. Well, that was the terms used atthe times. [to cross referrence, see J.Garner's fine 'Grand Prix' movie to seehow attitudes changed by 1966!]"
2,Good B Picture.,"What can I tell you? Fighting Seabees is a WW2 John Wayne actioneer from the Republic B-Picture factory. Pro character actors in a propaganda, morale booster (had an uncle who served in the Seabees) genre offering that has no resemblance to reality but nevertheless is a window into the era's pop culture."
2,Not much action & slow going,"I agree that you should definitely rent this before you buy it. This movie doesn't really focus on what the Seabees did or what they went through. The vast majority of this movie focuses of John Wayne's social life (dancing & mostly uninteresting dialogue/parties), instead of Wayne actually preparing these people. There's only two relatively short war scenes (one in the middle & one at the end) & virtually no time spent showing these guys getting ready for war. Even the war scenes aren't anything great--you can tell who's going to get shot because they suddenly become unusually melodramatic & happy so you'll feel sorry for them when they die (but not much character development, so it doesn't work). As far as the quality of the DVD, it has a pretty clear picture & some interesting production notes about the real Seabees. But really, stick with Sands of Iwo Jima for a war film John Wayne fans can be proud of."
2,Don't get me wrong...,"...I'm a huge John Wayne fan, but this movie has some serious shortcomings, including some of the acting by the cast and portrayals that, while acceptable at the time, are not so well received today. I won't knock John Wayne's acting, however, because he performed it as only John Wayne could. But some of the other acting was downright daffy, like when the singing Eddie Powers (William Frawley) was shot by the sniper and his singing wound down as though the sniper missed him and hit a nearby phonograph machine. ... The Fighting Seabees wasn't a totally bad movie, and I thought the formation of the SeaBees (if this movie is accurate) was very interesting. But some refinement and a small dose of reality would have made it much better."
5,very well done and accurate,"This is a movie that all should see , to better understand one of the less known fighting groups in themilitary."
1,The Real Seabees,"John Wayne is terrific, as always. From the standpoint of telling the story of the Seabees role in WW2, this movie is well worth watching. But the plot and love story were very Hollywood-ized and silly. And William Frawley doing calistenics is laughable."
3,The Duke Learns,"In this film John Wayne plays a costruction gang foreman who helps to found the Seebees after Pearl Harbour. Only one, well two, problems. The Duke does not want to take orders and he falls in love with Susan Hayward-his superiors girlfriend. This is actually a good action movie-fun to watch."
5,Educational,This is one of those John Wayne films that gives the viewer an excellent look at the work and difficulties the Seabees face during war time. As a Navy Veteran I greatly appreciate this film.
2,el final de la rata,"este cd fue el que marco el final para rata blanca nuevo vocalista,onda bastante comercial,no me gusta casi nada excepto algunos solos de giardino, el titulo real es rata blanca VII ,esta es una version de estados unidos que le editaron tambien a bandas como 2 minutos,resorte,la renga y otros para realizarlos domesticos ,pero son versiones pobres no en cuanto a la calidad de sonido pero si alteraron el arte original ,ademas que no incluyen fotos ni liricas,este es el ultimo disco de rata blanca antes de su desaparicion,giardino ahora esta en un grupo con el ex batero de a.n.i.m.a.l. ""temple"""
5,A Tale of Despair and Hope,"National Geographic's ""The Rhino War,"" is a gripping story of the intensive efforts undertaken in the late twentieth century to save the rhino in Africa. As a scientific documentary it is comprehensive and factual, but it is also undergirded by a strong appeal to the emotions and ethics of humankind. Complete with breathtaking imagery, offset by the dusty reality of modern wildlife management, the film is both beautiful and pertinent; even now, in a new century, the Black Rhino faces many of the challenges it did then. (And considering the current political situation in Zimbabwe, it isn't hard to imagine a revival of the conflict.) Nonetheless, the program offers a glimpse into a time of literal bloodshed--a time when conservation in Africa reached an unprecidented level of desperation. ""The Rhino War"" is moving and informative--a tribute to a magnificent animal and those willing to fight for it."
1,This thing sucks,"First of all, I had a hell of a time finding a lug nut that would fit under it. Once installed, it fell off once but I found it. Then after the winter it came time to rotate my tires and the lock was jammed. Luckily, it only took the back of a hammer and about 2 minutes to pry the whole thing apart. Proving it worthless but saving me a lot of trouble."
1,"If your bolt protrudes more than 1/2"" you're OUT OF LUCK","Might be a nice product were it not for a tiny hole (3/8"" ?) where at least a 1/2"" hole should be so your spare tire bolt can protrude through the lock. Most spare tire racks I have seen have a long protruding bolt after the nut is applied. This product is worthless unless you have only a short (1/2"" to maybe 3/4"") section of bolt sticking out."
3,Watch out when buying this item,"Do not loose the keys. This Master Lock double sided key blank is not generally available at hardware stores and locksmiths, at lease in my area, Cleveland, OH."
1,Does not fit Jeep Liberty,"This lug nut lock is the wrong shape to work with a Jeep Liberty spare tire wheel. There isn't enough room for it to be maneuvered into position to close or lock -- the metal shape of the wheel prevents this lock from fitting. If you have a Jeep, don't waste your time on this lock ... move on to another solution.Note: I found this lock after searching Google for ""spare tire lock for Jeep Liberty,"" and this item from Amazon was first in the search results as a lock that fits Jeep models. If anyone from Amazon is reading this, please fix the keywords associated with this product.Note 2: Amazon issued a prompt refund with no hassle."
2,Master lock,"Nice lock, but don't fit my spare. I have chrome rims from the factory and this lock don't even come close to going on the lug!"
5,Works great,The lock does exactly what I needed it for...it protects a lug nut on a spare tire on a boat trailer.
3,Nut Lock is OK,"I am using the lock on the nut holding the case over my spare tire. It fits with no problem, but, I can see that it would take very little to break it off. It does provide some protection and for that, I will leave it on."
2,frustrating,Didn't fit my tire rim. I wish there would have been more specifiic details regarding the type of rim the lock fits on. I was really frustrated! Now I have to start looking all over again to buy something else.
1,lug nut,no good for the jeep jk it might work for other car but not for the jeep don't waste you money
1,Spare tire lock,"This product did not fit the factory 17"" wheels on my Jeep Wrangler. All it did was score the alloy wheel when I tried to tighten it.Master Lock 262DAT Chrome Lug Nut Style Spare Tire Lock"
1,Poor Design...,"This lock is of such a poor design that it should be removed from the market. The premise of the design is good, but it does not take into account today's larger/longer lugnuts or recessed wheel openings. I regret purchasing this product, no wonder the price was so cheap. I ended up buying a set of locking lugnuts, I suggest you do the same."
1,Seems like a good concept...,But it will not work on my stock 1999 Jeep Wrangler SE wheels. This unit needs to be screwed down onto the existing lug - and unless there is plenty of clearance around the lug this will not fit.
4,Works as Described,"Just installed the lock on my trailer nose mounted spare tire. After installing, it obviously works as described in the ad description. So far, I am satisfied with the item."
2,Great Concept Poor Execution,"I bought this item in hopes of being able to keep the key with me, rather than try to hide the standard lug nut lock key in my car. I thought this was a great idea, however this lock does not fit over the lug nut for the spare tire on the Jeep Wrangler 2011. It would have been helpful if they listed the vehicles (with model year) that this lock would fit, or offer an option to buy a lug nut for your vehicle. So over all great concept, but poor execution for this product."
2,Rather Flimsy,"As always, arrived quickly from Amazon. I have preferred Master Lock products. However, I am surprised they would put their name to this item. The housing does not fit tight to the lug nut. There is a full one-third inch gap that would allow a point of leverage to pry the lock from the wheel. It is flimsy enough to do such. It will also rattle around, due to the floppy fit and is aestetically unattractive. The top of the housing appears to dangle. Will buy a cable lock instead."
3,"Didn't fit, Seems Flimsy",Tried putting this on my 2007 FJ's spare and it didn't fit. Additionally it seems pretty flimsy. I'm pretty sure I could get it off with a hammer and screwdriver no problem. I suggest looking for something else.
1,"TEENAGE BEAUTY, A BOOK FOR *BEGINNERS*","I felt as though Bobbi Browns ""Teenage Beauty"" is without a doubt a book for people just learning about makeup and it gives very very basic tips. If you know anything at all aobut makeup,do not purchase this book because it is for people who have never read about makeup before. I felt as though all it really had was Bobbi talking about herself and giving simple basic steps such as ""put on pink eyeshadow""...If you want to learn about makeup at more than a beginner level, this book is now right for you..There are no even close to dramatic makeup looks in this book and it highly focuses on NATURAL beauty which consists of VERY little makeup and really 3 minutes of time in order to achieve the look. This is great for those who want that ""on the go natural look"" but anything else, you will not find it in this book."
3,Definately not the typical make up book,"When I found this book, I first thought that it's just another stupid make up book that's splattered with pictures of ""natural"" girls and little to do with helping me feel natural. But when I looked inside the first thing that I noticed was that I wasn't getting that vibe. I actually felt good about myself. If anything, this book lets teenage girls understand that everyone may be different but that doesn't mean they still can't be ""Natural, Sexy & Awesome""!"
2,"Hmm..Not ""Everything""","If you've got a subscribtion to any teenage magazine out there, have friends or watch TV, you've probably know all ""tips"" this book offered. All of it is very common knowledge. Drink 8 glasses of water a day? Check. Set concealor with powder? Check. Line lips with lipliner to make lipstick last longer? Check. However, its good for those who aren't feeling great about their look. It's got that ""You're GREAT the way you are!"" vibe. For the rest of us teens who want to know actual makeup advice such as how to do smokey eyes or even contouring, look elsewhere. If you're curious, check this out of the library like I did."
2,self esteem book,"Bobbi Brown's teenage makeup book is not a book about how to apply make up. it is a book about how NOT to wear makeup. The overall theme of the book is that makeup is not necessary to be pretty. the small excerpt about the most popular beauty tool in teens :eyeliner, consists of a paragraph saying usually those who wear it are trying too hard. It talks about the most important makeup tool: blush and mostly emphasized on skin care.The book is designed to make teens feel good about themselves how they are and not about how they should wear makeup. If you are a make up fanatic looking to pick up tips this is not the book for you. If you are a teenager who doesn't wear makeup, and is wondering where to start this book is good for you. It is however, not ""everything you need to look pretty, natural sexy and awesome."" It should be titled ""everything you need to look natural"""
1,VERY VERY DISSAPOINTING,"I found this book was very obvious and talkative, not very helpful. I know a good amount about makeup, but was looking for more application tips and reviews or reccomends- I didn't find ANY! It was very general and most of the tips I learned in my first issues of YM or TEEN. I was really dissapointed, and can honestly say I learned nothing new. Spend your $25 on an Allure or Glamour subscription, both are much more helpful and give great ideas."
3,It's an OK good,"I thought this book was ok. I was looking for a book that showed step by step ways to do MANY styles of makeup. Since I ordered it from a catolog I didn't know what was inside. It was pretty much a bunch of tips. It also told a lot about herself when she was young. It was more like a book from Oprah W. then a makeup book because it also had a lot of things saying you should feel good about yourself and things to do if you don't like something about your face. It even talked about a party that she went to, to do the makeup of the girls there (her neice was one of them)& It talked about the girls there. I did like the pictures though. It had before and afters and a few step by steps (about 5) This isn't the best book who wants to learn alot about makeup, its good for someone who wants tips."
1,Not what I expected,"My grandaughter is only 12 and wants to learn how to put on make-up like a pro for her age group. Simple and clean and not too made up she was looking for more for a step by step illistration book and this was not it. So for her it was a waste of money to buy, she was really disapointed."
3,The same old stuff,I bought this book tring to find out how to get those looks you see on tv however this book just provided the same information I have received from all the other teen health books so if you own any of those already and are looking more for makeup then whole life tips this probably isn't the best book even though it is interesting.
5,Great book for all teen girls...,"A couple of months ago I took this book out of the library. I loved it! It gives imformation to people who think they know everything about teen beauty, and girls who are 12 and not quite teens yet (like me) who don't know much about make-up. I ended up checking it out a few more times and then, finally, getting it for Christmas. I'm still not tired of it. I recomend this book because it talks about zits, self-confidence, hair, how to MINIMIZE the amount of make-up, and much, much more. Plus, the girls they used aren't fake, like other models can be."
1,Sorry...,"but this is NOT a makeup guide. It's a pep talk about having good self esteem and good hygiene. I can get that from my parents. There are a few tips, but they are only useful if you have absolutely NO idea what to do with makeup. Don't waste your money."
1,what is this therapy?,"I got this book hoping it would be better than the other Bobbi Brown book I bought and it was just as bad. I mean we get it everyone is beautiful in their own way, but as the title says ""Everything You Need To Look Pretty, Natural, Sexy and Awesome."" I really learned absolutely nothing. I don't want a book that preaches to think beautiful, I want a book that will show you how. I know Bobbi Brown is an amazing make up artist, but her books have been very disappointing."
3,It was allright,"i received this book as a gift from one of my friends who loved it. i found it helpful but not necessary. it told me a lot of tips that i already knew. it didn't focus as much on beauty as i wouldve liked. there weren't styles or anything like that to help you piece together a look. it was basically telling you what it was. some other stuff, like being yourself etc, was nice and comforting, but not all i expected from a beauty book. i think it shouldve focused more on cosmetics, as that is what people were paying for! still a good read, but borrow your friends-dont buy your own. you could buy a better book with more help. this is great for the 1st read, boring the next. as i said, a good book to borrow but not buy."
4,For beginners,"I believe that this book has all the essentials for a teen that is just starting to want to get into the beauty ""scean"". I definatly reccomend it, but for me it was a waste of money because I allready knew about everything it taked about (makeup basics, a good skin care regimen, etc.) It basically touches all bases of information that is essental for teenage life and it even gives some history of Bobbie brown and her insecurities as a teen. One of the best parts of the book is that there is REAL GIRLS in it, not just models!!!!"
3,Library book,"While an excellent book for libraries as it provides a wide range of information for girls of different colors and skin types, it is not terribly useful for one person as much of the information is either too complicated or not precise enough."
1,What a waste,"I would have to agree that this book is nothing but common knowledge with commentary. I could have written this book! Come on! It doesn't even give ""how-to's"" or anything worth spending the time viewing. Very disappointed. This is the worst 17 bucks I've ever spent."
1,horrible book about a pedophile and his 13 yr old girl friend,"Not much of a mystery, needless cruelty and pedophilia. bleck. Don't waste your money - if you must get it from the library."
5,Great for Nick Cave fan's and novices alike.,"This is a great album from beginning to end; every song on this album is strong. ""Let Love In"" is necessary to any Nick Cave fan's collection, and since it is an even sampling of his sound it is a great starter album for anyone who is unfamiliar with the body of Nick Cave's work and looking to explore it. The mood and melodies of ""Let Love In"" is an excellent marriage between the harder darker sounds of albums like ""From Her to Eternity"" & ""Murder Ballads"" and the poetic and melodic themes found in ""Boatman's Call"" or ""As I Sat Sadly by Her Side."""
4,"4,5 stars. His best album",Personally i dont like Nick Cave. i have heard most of his albums and i find him extremely boring and i feel pessimistic feelings after hearing his music. Well this is an album that i really like. It has amazing songs like: Do you love me 1+ 2 - Nobody's babe now - Loverman (The best song on this album) - Red Right Hand ( The most famous songs - i remember hearing it in Scream 1 movie). The songs are very rhythmic with a mystical atmosphere and a very good variety of musical organs. The production is amazing and i really like the way the guitars in these songs sounds. If you like gothic or atmospheric metal and rock then buy this album and you wont regret it. For me it is by far his best album.
4,One of my favorite albums sounds better than ever...,"As with all of the Nick Cave remasters, this is worth he upgrade. I'm hearing guitar undercurrents and more that I've never noticed in all of the years I've listened to the original CD.I would have given this 5 stars, but taking off one because the Dolby 5.1 mix is mastered at an extremely low volume for some reason... cranked all the way, it's way lower than I want to hear. The DTS 5.1 mix is fine, though, and sounds FANTASTIC. Loverman and Jangling Jack gave me chills."
2,gotta be honest,"I've got to be honest. I love the guy, but of all his albums, this one contains the worst stuff. The best songs here are OK, and the throw-aways are worthless. On the album ""Henry's Dream,"" the song ""Brother My Cup Is Empty"" was essentially a throw-away (albeit a good one); on this album, it would lead the pack.Exception: I really got to like ""Do You Love Me Part II"" once I caught on to it. But the rest of this record is weak - ""Red Right Hand"" is kind of interesting, though.Fortunately, his albums improved a bit after this, because I think he came to terms with his mellowing nature and stopped trying to sound like a drug-addict rebel."
2,Breaks Without Warning,"Purchased a pair of these chairs 3 years ago. They could not have been sat on in excess of 8 times total. They were always kept in the folded up position when not in use, and stored in the garage during even our mild California winters. This summer, upon opening the chairs and sitting on for 5 minutes, decided I wanted to ""recline"" which involves pushing the lower bar forward with your feet. Without warning, the welding on the right side broke, toppling me sideways onto a concrete patio. Upon checking with the patio furniture shop from which they were purchased, we were informed that the guarantee was one year so we were out of luck.On the plus side, the chairs are very comfortable, may be used upright or as a recliner, are quite attractive, and come in a solid fabric or see-thru mesh. They fold for storage, although opening them is somewhat complex."
5,"Comfort, Comfort, Comfort!","Absolutely the most comfortable chair I have ever sat it. We have two of them, and are seriously considering purchasing two more for our deck. Well worth the money spent!"
1,don't buy!,bought this solely from the site image...it is very unwieldy to use...and on top of that its aesthetics are terrible. i bought two and returned both.
2,Make sure it set up properly.,"I had this last week and was very excited to show up at the back yard under morning sun. Unfortunately, one screw was broken anyhow and I didn't notice. It is just fine. After two to three times on/off, and turn back on the chair I was amazingly falling down to the deck floor like slippery on the ice. That is it.Now, it is working fine and lovely. But the back is still in pain."
2,Little use and broken chairs,I bought two of these chairs for camping. We have used these maybe on 6 camping trips. The bolts at the pivot point have fallen out twice. The black plastic tips on the legs have fallen out. To top it all off the weld on the leg has now busted on one chair rendering it unuseable. This all happened with very little use over two years. I weigh 160lbs so it is not like the chair is under stress. I would buy something cheaper with better quality.
5,Worth every penny.,I did not buy this chair from Amazon. I spent $... at a local store. Wish I'd bought it from Amazon (could have saved a bundle). I was shopping for a chase lounge for my deck. I looked at this chair and then looked at the price. My initial reaction was this is way too much money for a folding chair and I am looking for lounge anyway. Then ... I sat down in it! Boy are looks decieving. This chair was GREAT! I bought it without any regard for the price. I set it up on the deck and went to sleep. Work hard for my money and this chair earns it's price.
1,Excellent until you require repair!!!!,"I purchased 2 of these chairs and we love them, however they are now in need of restringing and even possibly new cloth. I have contacted 2 distributors by email & phone and even emailed lafuma themselves requesting info on where to purchase needed materials and no one has replied, making me feel these chairs are like a Bic Lighter, once they have gone throught their cycle, throw them away. I also was going to purchase 2 more of these chairs for our Florida home but I would definitely never purchase another product from this manufacture. They obviously treat you like the car salesman who wants the sale on the new car but not interested in the follow up service."
5,Typewriter Ribbon,Finally I get to type on my typewriter. It was hard to find any ribbon or erase tape for it. Thank you Amazon.
5,Totally awesome!,I looked everywhere for this diary and couldn't find anything like it in any store. My daughter absolutely loves it and has used it a lot. I love that you can also buy replacement pens so you can turn any notebook into a secret diary. Perfect for a young girl!
5,INVISIBLE DIARY SET,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY 8 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE WAS VERY EXCITED AND SPENT A LOT OF TIME WRITING IN THE DIARY AND SHOWING EVERYONE THE INVISIBLE INK.
3,Small,This was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Otherwise good product. My daughter loves the invisible pen!
3,Neat,It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but I'm pretty sure my niece will love this when she gets it on Christmas day!
1,Inaccuracies Makes This Book a Poor Choice,"Probably like most people, I was initially attracted to this book by its sheer scope and size (close to 1500 pages). However after a few attempts at using this book to troubleshoot real world problems, I have to agree with another reader that this book has too many inaccuracies to warrant purchasing.For example, not too far into the book on just page 18, there is wrong advice on how to adjust the size of a memory dump. Instead of a simple checkbox as the author wrote, Windows 2000 server has a listbox which allows the system administrator to select any one of a number of choices."
3,From the particulate to the general,"This book starts at the base level of the OS and then drills up to the general concepts.. Intuitively backwards for students. Not many useful diagrams or pictures. Very few ""good"" examples for configuration. Author uses complex domain and host naming examples where a simplier structure would have been more instructive. This is a nuts and bolts book. As a MCT and MCSE I would not recommend it for learning the product but as a reference only. To the authors defense most of the technical informaton is correct."
3,Inside?,"A good book for those who want a reasonable level of understanding about Windows 2000 Server as a whole. Boswell's writing style is better than most technical authors, and the book is a relatively easy read for those who aren't intimidated by its weight. For someone with a little Windows NT/2000 background who wants a good overview of the 2000 operating system or a reference that will help a user transition from NT to 2000, this would be a useful book. For the serious professional, there are useful sections, but the level of technical detail is a little disappointing and the technical errors in the book could be misleading. As another reviewer stated, ""most"" of the technical information is correct. If ""most"" is enough for you, or if you don't want the real nuts and bolts, this is a great book. If you really want the technical details about the operating system and its pieces, three stars."
3,not to the point,"this book may be considered a windows 2000 bible. I could use this book like a reference, not as a book to learn windows 2000 from."
2,This book contains misinformation,"I purchased this book to supplement my MCSE training- After finding several large discrepancies with Microsoft's recommendations, I returned the book. For example, I believe it is on page 150 where the book states to use Uptomp.exe from the W2K resource kit after adding a processor. This goes against Microsoft's recommendation (see Q234558). In fact, I couldn't even find this utility on the W2K resource kit. Uptomp.exe was a utility used for NT. After missing a practice test exam due to this, I felt like I couldn't trust the materials in this book any longer and took it back."
5,A must read before pulling RV in the mountains,I am planning to take my first trip into the Rocky Mountains with a 5th wheel this summer. This book is extremely helpful. It gives enough detail on the different mountain passes for you to know if you can make the hairpin turns with your rig. It gives the percent of grade and the length of downgrade in miles. Something I had not thought of was the height of tunnels. This book makes planning the route to take much easier.
2,"Mountain Directory West for Truckers, RV, and Motorhome Drivers","Useful to some degree. But, it is a 6 year old document (as of this writing) and it does contain some very outdated information. Many western roads have been upgraded to include new tunnels, wider lanes, passing lanes, bypasses, etc. That information does not exist in this 2006 copyrighted work. I am now searching for another book with more up-to-date info. This review, and rating, is solely based on today's needs for accurate information. I cannot advise anyone to buy this particular dated version."
2,not for the RVer,"Booklet only describes the downhill grades. I am interested in how steep the uphill side is, and can only attempt to read the descriptions in reverse. Pub also missed some fairly steep grades in Wy and Ut on 80. Booklet would be worth the money if a bit more detailed and consistent verbage. Remember we RVers need to know about uphill grades."
1,DON'T DO IT....,"It worked really good for about 3 months, then it would get a really bad reception, now we are loosing reception completly. I will wake up in the middle of the night & the monitor would be shut of (basically) the turn on again. Not a safety feature I like when it comes to one of my children. Do NOT buy, invest a little more money to get a better product."
1,no good,"This is the first monitor I've ever used, so I really didn't know what to expect...I did expect, however, that the monitor would pick up my baby's sounds throughout my not very big house (about 1500 sq ft). It doesn't. If I'm ""too close"" to the receiver (within 15 feet), the feedback that comes through the monitor is unbearable (a loud screeching sound) and the monitor is, as a result, useless. Worse than that, I can't get more than 25 feet away from the receiver or the reception goes out entirely. Even when the monitor is producing a useable signal, it's accompanied by a ton of static. I think I'm going to try a different brand..."
5,Love this monitor!,"Our old monitors weren't working so well, so I decided to buy new ones. After reviewing a lot of monitors, I liked this one best. It is an incredible monitor! The sound quality is amazing. I can hear my twins breathing, it's that sharp. Very much recommend this monitor!"
3,Middle of the road performer,We've been using the monitor for a couple months and have found it to be an average product. My main problem is the receiever isn't very sensitive. You have to turn the volume way up in order to hear sounds in the baby's room. But the more you turn up the volume the more static you hear. So every night before bed we adjust the volume to be low enough that the static doesn't keep us awake and high enough that we actually hear the baby when she makes noise. It's annoying. We had a Sony monitor that had a feature where it only made noise when the baby made noise - otherwise it was totally silent. I wish all monitors had that feature.
5,Big improvment over previous generation monitors,"Pros:+ 900MHz Communication for less interference and long range+ Rechargeable batteries+ 10 channel selection+ LCD display showing signal strength, battery gauge, channel #+ Alerts if monitor has different channel then base+ Visual light indicator for voiceCons:+ No light on the baseBought this model after trying out 49MHz version."
2,Cheap Electronics,I've only had it 4 months and one receiver doesn't turn on and the other one turns on only after several attempts. Reception is good though. Get a clock that goes tick-tock and put in the baby's room (so you know it's working) for extra peace of mind.
4,"A fine, underrated effort","I've been a big fan of Bruce Cockburn's since ""Stealing Fire"", and I own most of his earlier work now. This is not his finest album, but it's very good. ""I Don't Feel Your Touch"" is one of the most poignant broken heart songs you'll find, and the playful, thoughtful ""Shipwrecked At the Stable Door"" is wonderful. Give it a listen; you won't regret it."
3,A Transitional Effort,"In the world of songwriters and performers Cockburn stands at the top - still one of the best in the world. I have been a fan since ""In The Falling Dark"". He still seems to try to push himself to new levels of creativity and relevance. He is constantly amazing me as one who also writes and performs. That said, about half this album's songs are excellent. Not enough to make me keep playing it. The album is good - not his best. Too many songs fail to speak to me, to my experience, my world. The songs about relationships succeed the most, like ""Don't Feel Your Touch"", and a pared down arrangement. Charity of Night and Nothing But A Burning Light are better."
3,Not Bruce's best...but a strong effort,"The overall production is not as crisp as compared to other label's CDs of Cockburn, but this is a good effort. Several of the songs are very creative and entertaining. Of course, ""If a Tree Falls"" is now a standard. ""Tibetan Side of Town"" and ""Where the Death Squad Lives"" are extremely well written songs. They have become favorites."
5,Pure Brown,"Pure Guava is my favorite Ween album. Although I think Mollusk is their their ""masterpiece"", Guava is the ""old school"" two-man Gene and Dean Ween team at their DAT/4 track best. This album is all brown and boognish. Every track is mindblowing and makes the listener question their own sanity. I might not pick this as the first Ween album to check out, because Chocolate & Cheese is more accessible to the rookie. But Pure Guava is a must have for anyone who likes Ween. Standout tracks include Tender Situation, Stallion 3, Big Jilm, Push the Little Daises, Going Gets Tough, Raggaejunkiejew, and Mourning Glory."
5,my favorite ween album,very messy and very good. lots of great tracks. ween is full of surprizes no doubt. this is there best for me thou. all kinds of ideas going on here. my 2 favorites off here would be the beautiful Sarah. and the weird art rock noise that is Mourning Glory. of course everything else on here is nice as well. overall a great album from a band that has built up an amazing catalog of songs over the years.
4,messed up,"if you ever trip, this album will make you trip 10 times harder because it is so screwed up. If you don't believe me, try it."
3,Take the good with the irritating,"... when listening to this record. I'm a fan of the more produced/serious/post-'Guava' work. That's right, I at one point scoffed at this band (even though I bought this album for the second time, 8 years after my first was stolen.) I got both the Mollusk and White Pepper a few X-mas' ago and have renewed faith in this band. This album has a lot of jerkin off and childish wit going on so it doesn't deserve 5 or 4 stars. There are some strokes of brilliance here and there;Don't Get to Close (to My Fantasy)- the song is really easy and soothing guitar and then breaks into a triumphant Bowie-esque chorus.Push the Little Daisies- happy kind of song with some quirky heartbreaking lyrics.I Saw Gener Crying- good but what the hell is it about?Spring Theme(?), Big Jilm, Hey Fatboy- some entertaining idiocy.Obviously, there are some spots here and there that make this album better if your innebriated when listening to."
2,Pure Genius? No,"Ween's clever smirking artyness sounds considerably less innovative and cerebral in large doses. This is the album that contains the alt hit `Pushin Up The Daisies', which suffers a bit by the context. Turns out the whole album sounds like that, which sort of ruins the joke. Recommended to people who think the Mekons are country."
1,Please dont waste your money,There's fifteen bucks I'll never get back; next time I'll just flush it down the toilet and save the time.
1,Pure Garbage,"Anyone who can hear a song called, ""Push the Little Daisies and Make Them Come up"" sung by a 12 year old girl, and like it, not to mention plays the track again without hesitating or flinching really needs their heads checked for brain-damage and retardation."
4,Practical examples of good object-oriented design,"All in all, a pretty good book. It covers two complete case studies, from requirements to detailed design. It also includes finished examples of the programs that were designed. While the use of Yourdon's method is a little outdated, I would definately recommend this to those who want to get their feet wet in OO."
5,great burner for the price,Well I feel this is a great deal. It's a fast burner and reliable too. Iomega always makes great products. I've had no problems with this drive and the software bundle is nice too.
2,"Healthy, but not very tasty","I ordered a 60 pack of these and am disappointed. I have tried other natural fruit bars and leather, and this one just isn't as good. It is soft, but the flavor is a little awkward."
1,DID NOT WORK!,"THE DISC DID NOT WORK! I inserted it, pressed play and nothing happened. No music, no lyrics. Does anyone know how to get a refund? I've sent a request but haven't heard back"
2,First and worst,"I'm a dinosaur that's a die hard Barry Manilow fan in everything he does. However, this production was horrible once you see&hear all other concerts&specials he's done before."
3,Good Child's Sleeping Bag,"Pros: The price I paid for these sleeping bags for my two children ($29.99 each) was a great value. The exterior fabric is nice and it has a great stuff bag with a carrying handle. It rolls up small and compact. The ""mummy"" top can be sinched up to create a hood on cold nights.Cons: The polyester fabric on the inside is cold in cold weather. When the weather is hot, it doesn't breath, so it becomes very uncomfortable. The zip out sheet SOUNDS like a great idea, but it's very flimsy and with my children it just ends up being kicked down to the bottom of the sleeping bag. If I had it to do all over again, I would buy a sleeping bag that had a cotton interior. That is the major drawback with this bag. The fabric makes all the difference on how warm/cool you stay at night and this interior just doesn't meet the muster."
1,Misleading temperature rating!,"This bag was claimed as 25F rating and the ""linen"" itself rated at 60F. That was totally unrealistic! The linen was so thin that it was hardly useful at any temperature. You wouldn't feel any difference with or without it alone. I was using the bag with the linen inside my car on a road trip. My feet started to get cold, keeping me up at only as low as 50F. That was far above 25F as claimed. I am in 40 and good health, not a ""cold"" person. If this bag would not work for me under 50F, it would not work for most others either. If you actually count on this bag for 25F environment, you are putting youself in great danger. Don't believe the rating! It is only good for mild temperature."
5,Tenacity and intellectual curiosity,"Awe-inspiring writing about a thoroughly engrossing subject, this biographical-historical novel is not surpassed. I read it right after his other novel, ""Not as a Stranger"", and never forgot this one as I did the other. Inspiring, and due for a reprint, this is one ""biography"" that can't be put down, and demonstrates the power of logical thinking and the ability to come to a conclusion not supported by the knowledge of the day--and hit it right on the head! This book has remained on my all-time inspirational list, still, after fifty years of medical practice."
1,The Cry and the Cocenant,I purchased this book for $10 and the condition was listed as acceptable. The book is truly in extremely poor condition.The binding is broken ansd every page is loose. I have been unable to contact the seller with my complaint. I have never had this problem with any book purchased through Barnes and Noble dealers.
1,Too many factual inaccuracies and misleading instructions,"This book has some potentially useful information, particularly suggestions about different scent combinations. However, it has numerous factual inaccuracies - you should insulate your soap to ensure proper cooling??? Fragrance oils used for soap are alcohol-based??? Crayons to color soap??? Some of the recipes involve extremely expensive essential oils that are cost prohibitive (vanilla & rose for example) and the amounts recommended would require mortgaging your home. The methodology of soap making is antiquated - no mention of using a stick blender instead of hand stirring, for example. There are much better choices out there such as Susan Miller Cavitch's book (dated but still useful) and Alicia Grosso's Everything Soap Book."
4,Wonderful easy recipes that turn out great,"I actually found this book at a flea market. I loved the layout and the size of the book. It isn't very large, which I like. I think big books are too bulky. The recipes are easy to follow and soaps turn out wonderful. Informative and easy to read and understand. This book is all cold-process soap. No melt and pour recipes. I haven't yet tried the shampoos or fragrances but the soaps are very nice. Smell good, and lather wonderfully."
2,Pretty pictures but.......,"This is not a good book for making soap or anything else. It has more pictures than recipes and what recipes it does have are not very practical.This is NOT a book for beginners either, spend the money on something else like soap making for fun and profit, and the soap makers companion.I bought this book, and was very dissapointed, I resold it and not for very much I might add."
3,Great for ideas,"Bardey's book basically rehashes a lot of tips found in other books. It's not a book for beginners but soap pros will find nice ideas for expanding their soap lines.Note: One BIG problem I had with the Bardey book is in the ""Custom Soaps"" section. She lists the recipes but has no pics of the actual soaps! She only has pics of ingredients. Ugh!:-("
2,danger,"This is a poorly written book, that is suitable only for academic study, and a poor one at that. If you are serious about trying to make soap, you should look elsewhere. I was lucky, in that I have a minor in chemistry from college, so that I could fill in the essential data omitted by the author. If I did not have experience to rely on, making soap from this text would have been near hopeless"
1,sure are a lot of soap books,"This is just another book that was written to cash in on the current DIY craze in toiletries and bath products. The author is not much of a soapmaker, and I ended up selling my copy to a used bookstore within 6 months of ordering it. The book is beautiful to behold, while being a pain to actually use due to the format and size, but is essentially useless next to the few books that actually impart info which empowers crafters to make ingredients decisions because they've learned something. Read Cavitch if you want to learn something.This is just another abbreviated Martha-esque book."
1,Silverplated flatware,I was very disappointed with the quality of the product. I sent it back immediately and got a refund.
4,Great review of maps and their influence by and on politics,This is a great addition to the discussion on maps as a tool or politics and a summary of previous works in the area. The writing style is is not hyperbolic like many radical theory types in the field yet still carries an energy that makes for easy reading. The collection of maps supplements the volume well.
1,Only the Strong Survive,"Boyde Rice gives us an unforgiving philosophy to live by. The strong suvive,the history of man is the history of war etc... but is he wrong? That is the point. Ragnar the Red's book ""Might is Right"" is the source of this recording. The dilema for the listener will be: this is a harsh philosohy,but its making perfect sense. Oh Lord make it go away. But it is still there with its truth staring you down. I say embrace the words and sonic scapes of ""Might"" and become stronger for the experience!I COULD NOT CHANGE MY ABOVE RATING...IT SHOULD BE FIVE NOT ONE STAR!!!"
5,The book that will set the Mark!!!,"I really enjoyed this work. These character's seemed all too real. I couldn't believe that I actually had alot in common with some of the male charcter's in the book. I had been through some of the same things if not worst. I just went through a messy divorce and custody battle and I lost everything. Which is what drew me to this book because someone told me to read this book. They also told me that it was based on ther authors personal experiences, and the the author was arrested while promoting this book. When I heard that I said anyone that has gone through that must have something to say and I really need to read this book. And wouldn't you know it I was right the story is great and ooh so real!! It has you on the edge of your seat the whole time. A must read again for all!!!"
1,Confused review,"The product I received did not even resemble the picture of the product I ordered. Further, it did not vibrate, even with new batteries. No instructions were received for assembly??? Very disappointing."
2,Way smaller than it appears..,"I bought this for my gf.. First of all, don't be fooled, it is waaay smaller than it appears.. I would just buy a normal pocket rocket which are cheaper and have the same function.. The product was a little defective and had problems to start.. I had to tale it apart to fix it and once it was fixed... I wasn't that great.."
1,These are not Aimco,"These came marked as some other brand, I needed them that day so I had to use them I threw the box away so now I don't remember who made them but they are not Aimco premiums."
3,"Same Faces, Different Book","In general, I am an admirer of Amado's work, but this is not his best effort. He has once again introduced us to the cast of characters that he grew up with in his native Bahia - the miserably poor of the sertao, the vaqueros, the itinerant peddlars (one of which - a Turk again, no less - is the main character), the narrow-minded clergy, all milling around and not really going much of anywhere. The ""Showdown"" is a faceoff between bandits, which is a culmination of the events in this little backwater village on the Sao Francisco.As usual, Amado is very good at providing us with a slice of life and a variety of interesting characters, but the story is a bit too thin in this work. Not up to the level of ""Dona Flor"" or ""Gabriela.""Incidentally, the reference to a Sudbury Horse Classic in the trade reviews for this book are obviously for some other book, apparently an English mystery of the same name. No horses here, except in an incidental way."
2,Tired Amado,"Jorge Amado has been writing about sex in the hinterlands of Brazil for years. It is a tired subject. Amado's writing style is tired, this being his last ""book"". Bahia of today (2010) is electric with multireligions, petroleum, jeitinhos among friends and non-friends, dynamic women who serve as medical missionaries, and of course a coastal scene which rivals Recife, Rio, and southern-most Brazil. None of this emerges in the writing of Amado -- just male-female disengagement, property issues and short scenes without a plot line. The title in English sounds more Texan than the dream-style of Bahianos. I prefer his earlier novels which sealed a culture in mid-century when the lid on Brazilian people was about to explode."
1,WORST COOKBOOK EVER,"This is the worst cookbook I've ever seen. Don't be fooled into thinking it's an inspiring art book, either. Not only would it be useless in the kitchen, it would never end up on my coffee table, either. This is bad art, too.The photos are totally unappetizing. The design is lame. It's like a display of how horrific you can make food look. It's disgusting. I'm surprised at Charlie Palmer and Ten Speed Press. His other books and his cooking are awesome.Even if these recipes are fabulous, I'll never know it because the book is not useable -- with stark type going in many different directions on each page -- it's impossible to cook from it.Design professors! You can use this book as an example of how function should never follow form. Or in this case, how function can actually cease to exist because of irresponsible use of design."
1,Oh the Irony,"I didn't listen to other reviewers who panned this booked before I bought it. I've eaten at Aureole in New York and was wowed by its commitment to excellence. Surely the cookbook maintains those standards. Sadly it does not.First, every page of the book is white on black. Images of the dishes (if that's what they are since they are nearly impossible to make out) are in negative. Completely unappetizing. The text of the recipes is at 45 degree angles on the page and not easy to read or follow.Was this an experiment that failed horribly? I think so. The most ironic is the word ""art"" in the title which is not what you find inside the book."
4,"Simple, Straight to the point, Ritch Text","I found this book to be a very good reference for the design & implementation of backup power systems.Throughout my 3-year experience in the U.P.S systems field, i found new & very important ideas in this text i did not know, not even in my training courses !!The bottom line, this text is a very good deal for professionals & start-ups as well."
1,What Was He Thinking?,"By far and away the WORST Lucio Fulci movie ever made. Luckily for me I rented this movie before I decided to add it to my collection. The description of the movie made it sound interesting enough to rent and being a big fan of the Fulci trademark movies I thought it would be pretty good. Sweet house of horrors has none of the trademark Fulci gore which was quite a let down not to the mention the movie is just absolutely a waste of time. By this point in his career I think Fulci just ran out of ideas and threw this together witout much effort. Even the trademark eyeball scene was sub par at best.If you're a ""HUGE"" fan of Lucio Fulci and haven't seen this film I recommend strongly that you rent it first. If your looking for a good Fulci movie may I suggest ""Zombie"" or ""The Beyond"". Don't waste your time with this unimaginative, dull, pointless film. It's really that bad!"
4,How can you not love Lucio Fulci?,"Not one of Fulci's best by a long shot, but it does have a place in any Fulci fan's or gorehound's collection. Minimal plot, but good use of special effects."
2,What the hell.....,"I cant believe Lucio Fulci made this film, its with out a doubt his worst movie ever. The only good part is when the guy robbing the home gets his throat sliced. The whole movie I waited for Gore or action or something and it never came and that was dissapointing. Check it out if you find it for $5-$10 and $10 is to much but, its Fulci so I will keep it in my collection. A great Fulci flick is Zombi and The Beyond along with 2 more decent flicks being ""house by the cemetary"" and ""City Of the Living Dead."" but all 4 are worth the buy well to me atlest"
4,"Your Pal, Steve","Having seen Steve Peifer on CNN Heroes Awards, and You Tube videos, I was additionally inspired by his book. It's just like reading your own personal emails from him. While there is the occasional typo,it's not preachy or pretentious,and his deep devotion to his family,faith and ministry are awesome. He's got a great sense of humor which must really help him out in the midst of struggles of real life in Kenya. I hope & pray his work will continue to grow, especially in light of recent turmoil. If you're not expecting a novel then you won't be disappointed in his style, and hopefully rewarded by inspiration leading to action."
5,"Inspiring, Hysterical, Honest","I know this family personally and worked with them at Rift Valley Academy. They are very down-to-earth people and it was fun to revisit the names and places where I lived through the pages of this wonderful book. They are inspiring and set an example of following God step by step in obedience. The anecdotes are hysterical, nearly as funny as Steve himself. You will find yourself laughing out loud! The descriptions of the problems in Kenya, the lives of missionaries and their kids and the questions they raise for Steve and his family are honest and thought-provoking. A very meaningful read and a way to put a face with the myriad of problems facing Africa today."
3,"Stick together; good for cold liquids, need 2 cups for hot","I agree with previous reviewers and wish I had read them before buying. The cups stick together very badly. And the hot liquids are too hot to handle; ok for cold liquids. Better than styrofoam, but needs improvement."
1,Impossible to use.,"I purchased these compostable cups for a wedding, with the hopes of minimizing the environmental impact of a large wedding celebration. Unfortunately, these cups were almost impossible to separate, it took a dedicated friend one-half hour to separate, with a flat screwdriver, just three sleeves of these cups - before we gave up on them. The big plus: Amazon was great about taking back the unused portion and issuing a refund. Perhaps the manufacturer could figure out a way to package them without getting them stuck together."
1,sent them back,I agree with the last review. The cups stuck together and were almost impossible to pull apart. I returned entire shipment.
2,disappointed,The product is excellent but the cups stick together and are very difficult to pull apart.
4,Got Milk?... Milk Inc. that is.,"This is a really great dance anthem. The lyrics are really catchy and easy to learn. It is the first I have ever heard of this group, and this song left me wanting to get my hands on everything by them. The female-vocalist has a very close resemblance to Marsha from Ian Van Dahl's ""Castles in the Sky"" (I am sure you know how huge that track is). Milk Inc. has got themselves a real hit here. I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, because of the lack of x-tra remixes for the cost. You may want to checkout the state-side release instead. If you are from my area check-out DJ Acid's CD ""Phiya"" which features this great song. If my review was helpful to you, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
4,Awesome! Pure Energy,I must say this is a great song. The lyrics r original and the beat is very uplifting. The song is so good that i wish it could have been longer. I give this CD-Single 4 stars not because the song deserves it but because it lacks remixes. But altogether it is worth having if u r a truly Eurodance Fan. Dont miss it!!!
2,Ok,"Its pretty good, especially So Much Mine, but isen't the best. It also gets a little repetitive. Sorry to offend, but this is not quite as good as everybody says"
5,songs and melodies etched in my heart,"someone likened the Story's sound to Simon and Garfunkel. The couple of Jonatha's and Jennifer's voices creates a rare sound that i've never heard before. it's magical. at first, the music in this album is beautiful to listen and catchy at the same time, but after more listens, each song ascends and descends subtley that they'll draw you further and further in, curious of their complexities. please give this album a listen. it's carefully crafted and taut. perhaps, one day, you'll be scarred by this music like me.it's a pleasant wound to have, Jonatha. thanks for the excellent music."
5,Masterfully Crafted,"This book is fascinating and engulfing. Most importantly, however, it is extremely illuminating. The authors usually present both the Israeli and Arab viewpoints on every important issue and decision made over the past 56 years. They paint very human pictures of the sometimes larger-than-life personalities that have shaped recent Middle Eastern history, including Yasser Arafat, Anwar Sadat, David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Rabin. The book also includes glimpses into the vital role the Soviet Union and, especially, the United States have played in the formation of the present-day region. This book should be read by people who want to look beyond the sensational and provocative headlines the region creates and take a peek at the motives behind the actions. Although this book is fairly lengthy, it is definitely a page-turner that a voracious and interested reader may find easy to read in a single sitting."
4,Great primer for learning ActiveX Controls,"If you're new to web design and want to tie in ActiveX Controls to enhance navigation or just make your pages interactive, get this book. It's easy to understand and I found it to be very useful.It shows you how to use VBScript and JavaScript to tie ActiveX controls together, in a clear, easy-to-understand way."
3,Great costume!,"This costume is great. Wig fit well, was concerned due to other reviews, but it is great! I ordered a size up. This is pricey for a flimsy dress and wig, hence the three stars, but our daughter is thrilled so that's that."
3,Nice costume,This Princess Leia costume looks like the character and all but my 5 year old only wore it a few times and without the wig because it was itchy.
2,Not great.,"The dress & belt: Fine, and good fit.The wig: My complaint isn't so much that the wig is small (I don't know if there are different sizes for the wig, but the costume we bought was a size small, and my daughter is 6 years old) but more that it's flimsy. The buns came apart before she'd even worn it out of the house. I had to do a lot of pinning to keep it together. I ended up making her a headband with Leia buns attached because the wig was so uncomfortable, and I didn't think it would hold up for her school party."
3,Princess Leia,"The wig is extremely small, and uncomfortable. The costume runs rather large, but I just hemmed the sleeves and bottom so it was fine. Worked out great as a Halloween costume, but after the night was over my 10 year old daughter informed me she did not want to wear the costume again because of the wig. Seems a bit pricey for something she used for one night:("
3,Low Quality for the Price - but still worth it!,"PRO's- The wig- The wig- And the wig!- Seriously - the wig makes this whole thing worth it!CON's- Very poor construction for a child's costume- - The robe tore after one use- - The wig started falling apart- - The belt is a printed piece of fabric- Expensive for the low qualityOverall - felt like we overpaid, but it was SO WORTH IT! She looked fabulous as Princess Leia!"
2,Super small wig,The wig didn't fit on my daughter and she has a small head. Would not recommend unless you plan to purchase a new wig
3,Poor quality,This was way too large for my daughter and not the best quality for the money. She was happy with it but I definitely would not buy it again.
3,Wig's a Problem,"The dress and belt are fine, but the wig is WAY too small for a child who will fit the dress."
4,Very cute,My 6 year-old loves all things star-wars. She was thrilled with this Princess Leia Costume. The wig was a big hit too!
5,What a wonderful book.,"I'd never heard of Stephen Dobyns, but the opening lines of the first story, A Happy Vacancy, convinced me I'd struck gold: ""There are perils in life so disturbing that we need to hold ourselves in a state of readiness, ever alert to exercise our outrage and disbelief ... Jason W. Plover, a poet with six books, was killed when a pig tumbled out of the sky and crushed him as he was crossing Massachusetts Avenue against the light at Harvard Square."" This unusual opener is more than just a ploy to get our attention, it leads us to the real point of the story: ""Jason Plover was someone always in a hurry. Had he been a tad less serious, a tad more casual, he might be with us still today."" Hooray! It's a cautionary tale about not taking yourself too seriously."
4,Step Into A Different World,"Having never read anything by Stephen Dobyns, this was a new experience in other-worldliness. A compilation of short stories by Dobyns, the title story gives us a peak into the mind of a man dealing with the same frustrations which haunt each of us. His solution is far different than what we might seek, but there is an ""everyman"" quality to his choice -- we WISH we could do that...The book is filled with images which will stay with you long after finishing the book -- from pigs hurling from the sky to a lovingly propped-up old dead man. You'll smile as you recall the vivid pictures painted by Dobyns.If you've never tried this kind of book before, give it a shot -- you'll enjoy the adventure!Steven Reis"
5,Library humor for all,"This series of library comic strips is funny not only to librarians, but to anyone who uses the library (evidenced by the fact that my mother and sister both enjoy them!). Dewey and his staff encounter situations that all public service employees deal with, and everyone should check out their website then buy the books!"
5,THE Intro to McLuhan,"I trust this is the one compiled by his son Eric.Anyway, this book seems to read like McLuhan always wanted it: short, digestible bursts of prose.The Playboy Interview is fantastic. I always generally enjoyed McLuhan in a dialog scenario more than his writings, though his writings definitely tend to have more moving moments of clarity and epiphany."
3,"Expected book to include CD, but it did not!","I had thought this book was to be accompanied by an illustrative CD of piano music played by Charles Rosen, but it did not. Amazon's page for this book should make this omission very clear!"
3,Very hard book,Rosen's knowledge and mastery of music is astounding. He really knows what he is talking about. There is a-lot in the chapters on Chopin.But this is a really hard book. Don't expect to learn much unless you have a very firm grasp of music theory and piano. There are dozens and dozens of pages of notes ... often from works that are not that familar. Even when I was musically familar with some of the works I could not work through Rosen's analysis. The book also seems poorly edited in some places.
3,Good Item until it comes loose!,"Works well and protects my electronic equipement, but started coming loose at the plug point"
1,Batteries.com Replacement battery for Asus Mypal A730,"I spoke with a rep of Batteries.com because I needed a replacement for my battery for an Asus Mypal A730 PDA. He told me that his batteries are guaranteed to work with my type of PDA,after several friends of mine had experienced problems trying to replace their PDA batteries. I received the battery and it did not even charge. I sent it back for a refund - shipping and handling charges on both ends. They sent me an email over 2 weeks ago telling me they had credited the charge back to my credit card for the price of the battery. The credit has yet to appear and their Accounts Payable department insists that they did issue a credit. - I think they must be mistaken."
1,Not as good as I thought.,"I can agree on some points by the author of unplugging from the social rules, materialism, etc... but this book seems to have a few contradictions. It has its good points but not something I take literally."
4,An excellent companion piece to the movies,"Since the movies were not only action-oriented but highly philosophical (sort of Zen-like), so, too, is this very good book. But I believe one should also get some great science fiction books and delve into their philosophical depths, below the high-tech, the action, and, yes, even the cyberpunk tales: ""Foundation"" trilogy, ""Childhood's End"", ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Neuromancer"", ""Darkeye: Cyber Hunter"", and other such bodies of work. All present an undertone of philosophical views, usually through the protagonists' eyes, of the workings of the world and society."
5,Gourmet dishes within the grasp of any culinary beginner,"Cooking For Blonds: Gourmet Recipes For The Culinarily Challenged is a compilation of recipes carefully chosen and designed to be ""novice cook friendly"". Each recipes is even rated for quick reference with ""Blond"", ""Blonder"", and ""Blondest"" symbols. From Blue Corn Pancakes; Apricot-Lemon Scones; Skinny Shepherd's Pie; and Coconut-Pecan Biscotti; to Pepper Butter; Avocado Cream Soup; Garlic Shrimp Pizza; and Peppermint Whipped Cream, Cooking For Blondes brings truly gourmet dishes within the grasp of any culinary beginner -- and will prove to have great appeal for even the most experienced kitchen chef."
5,I love Mcduff!,"Perfect to read to your puppy before baby arrives !! Also fun , easy read for little ones to help them see things from the viewpoint of their furry friends."
1,"Chevy Sprint yes, geo metro NO","This book is great for Chevy Sprint owners, but aweful if you've got a Geo Metro. Electrical diagrams and diagnostic explanation are few and far between, and overall the book ignores or barely glazes over the details for a Geo. The title is deceptive and the ""2-cars-for-1"" concept is false.For a good geo metro repair manual, purchase the Chiltons 89-93 Manual. It will also cover 94 geo metros, which are identical to 93, except the half-metal bumper was replaced by a whole-rubber one. Later models (95-2000) are extremely similar, but they also have slight differences. This book will also help for general maintenance on those cars."
3,"Good, but not great","The book was based upon a disassembly of a Sprint and not a Metro and there are significant and annoying differences. A lot of the content is copied verbatim from other books, and I'm not sure that it is all accurate.This book will help you perform common repairs, but is maddeningly silent on a number of other ones (e.g. swapping radios). Also it isn't as detailed as some of their other books.I'd buy it again, only because it is useful, but I don't like it, and given that very few mechanics see Geos, it doesn't explain enough."
3,"Sprint Yes, Geo Maybe","Most of the book is on the older Sprints. Not much on the newer Geo Metros. Very little on trouble shooting electrical problems. No schematics, only flow diagrams. Very little detail on additional options. Good for mechanical problems.<BR,,,,"
2,Not up to date,"This review book is not up to date, specifically the questions are in a format nowhere near USMLE's exam. Memorize the newest edition of First Aid."
5,Smokin' CD !,"I am new to Gatton's music, but like the other reviewers, I was blown away by his guitar playing on this. ""Funhouse"" should have been platinum instead of ""Smooth"". Danny makes Santana look like a beginner. His blend of Rock, Blues, Country was unique. He had great taste, chops. He had everything. ""Harlem Nocturne"" is searing, haunting. The other numbers include beautiful ballads, rockish numbers, and miscellanous pieces, all of them great because of Gatton. Buy this and enjoy !"
5,just like new,the product arrived on time and it looked just like new!I am sure that this will come in hand when creating my classroom centers this year
4,Nice Paper That Does the Job,"I wanted an orchid-colored paper and ordered a pack of Ampad pads. The color was a disappointment. It is a grayish blue that is fine, but not what I consider to be orchid (i.e., a light lavender); yes, I know that a grayish blue is part of the orchid spectrum, but the color is dull. The paper, however, is very good quality, and if you are not fussy about color, you won't be disappointed."
2,deceiver,"good hardcover edition and photos. but... there is erroneous data in the book (the me109 D had a Jumo engine and not a Daimler Benz!), there are misplaced subtitles on some pictures (and one or two are wrong) and one of the photos show up twice. so this wouldn't be my choice if looking for a book covering the general history of the 109 (although it looks good in the shelf)."
1,The Carolina Hurricanes are the true Stanley Cup Champions.,"This video is entertaining as it is hockey and the Stanley Cup playoffs but it is ridiculous that the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup yet again. The Carolina Hurricanes played their hearts out throughout the playoffs and regular season despite ridicule by every other team and nearly every sports commentator and journalist. Nobody took them seriously at all even after they won the Eastern Conference Championship. Hopefully, they'll show that they can go all the way next season. As it stands, don't get this dvd and instead the get the Carolina Hurricanes dvd ""THIS Is Championship Hockey"". It's great!"
2,McGrath repeats himself again ad nauseum,"If there ever was a writer whose entire opus consisted of cutting and pasting from one book to another then McGrath is him! Blackwell has done an excellent job of marketing his comependium of encyclopedias, moographs, readers, and commentaries. A clear writer who delivers his presribed message.Amazing how little it takes to be an Oxford Don these days! Excellent material for the novice. His work on Justification however, is outstanding."
3,ex Deep Purple & Whitesnake is back!,"yes I agree with the review below! Coverdale has travelled the musically performance for almost than 25 years. He led the loudest band of all time DEEP PURPLE (1973-76) and then Whitesnake 1978-1990. And now his new solo cd 2000 can be his most honest master piece since his HARD rock adventures.... If You re DEEP PURPLE fan and Whitesnake Fan,....this is a must!"
3,sorry David! your latest solo cd is a bit weak,"coverdale's latest solo cd is musically a little bit weaker than his glory days with Deep Purple and Whitesnake. the hardrock diva seems to have a tiredness in 2000 and produced almost 65% only sappy ballad songs such as dont ya cry, she gives me, too many tears, midnight blue and the weakest track on the albumwherever ya may go. the other tacks such as into the light, the river song , living on love and cry for love are strongly returning to the tradition of hardrock.his latest solo cd has to be seen: it has musically nothing to do with the old coverdale's immense original power of hardrock, which he wrote with deep purple or whitesnake for 34 years ago, at the time he wrote about the mythology, legend, social critic as a main topic in his many solid hits with deep purple and whitesnake."
2,WHAT LIGHT ??,"COverdale... Once the singer of Deep Purple... once the leader of the good rocking band Whitesnake.. Now writing only lyrics of love, in the better style of Mariah Carey, Backstreet Boys and others.... THe instrumental is good, but the lyrics themes are disgusting .."
4,Still a Great Voice,"A very pleasant album and while I found the songs varying from mediocre to terrific, Coverdale's voice sounds as strong and accurate as it ever has. ""Love is Blind"" and ""Slave"" are fantastic with the latter being as hard a rocker as anything he's done in his Whitesnake/Purple past. Coverdale fans won't be disappointed."
4,ex deep purple and whitesnake,"the song like love is blind is amazing and the other songs are not depends on the Zeppelin style. Coverdale has developed his own sing style. The ballad duet with a female singer is blessed by the god in heaven. I guess Deep Purple fans and snake fans love this album,....like I do"
3,For Guitar Players Only!,"I'm not sure what book the above reviewers are talking about, but ""The Beatles Guitar Techniques"" DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY BASS PARTS. It's strictly for guitar players only. If you're looking for Beatles bass parts, look elsewhere, there are none here.Maybe that's why the title has an asterisk, because ""The Beatles Guitar Techniques"" and ""The Beatles Guitar Book*"" are two different books. If so, Amazon should make it clear and stop selling the Guitar techniques book as the Guitar book."
4,Gel Candle making,"I had an interest in gel candle making but did not know where to start. When I found this book it told me everything I needed and where to get it. When a new craft is started it is extremely hard to find other people who are doing it and to find the ""how to"" and ""where"". This book provides all of this."
2,I couldn't figure it out,"I bought this book because I my 12 year old son likes to make candles. I thought this would be a great addition. Although the story behind the writer was captivating, I couldn't quite figure out what supplies I need, where to get them or how to get started. I'm in need of easy lists and more step by steps, and this book couldn't provide that."
5,Let me say something,Alright we all know tash is tite but one thang. HE IS NOT FROM LA. If you own the coat 2 coast cd it says he is from my home town of COLUMBUS OHIO JUST LIKE TO STRAIGHTNG THANGS OUT PEACE!
2,Pass on this...,"Tash' debut album Rap Life is plain out horrible. The production on the album is incredibly wack and is the album's biggest weakpoint. Tash's rapping on the other hand is superb and he comes up with sick one-liners that make you hit the rewind button. GZ is GZ with Kurupt is a classic song. The Game featuiring Carl Thomas is also a great track that utilizes a slinky laid back beat and has Tash ripping the mic. Smokefest 1999 featuring Outkast and B-Real is yet another one of the standouts. The beat is thick like the smoke they are inhaling and lazy sounding on this song. Uh lets see couple other good tracks here and there but none worth mentioning. Also the skits are more than just stupid. The album's production is the main flaw, and even Tash's unstoppable flow and potent lyrics can't save it. My advice: listen to the Liks albums and pass on this trash, its not worth it."
3,I'd give it 3 and a half - Tash you know you know she's on your jock,"Im a big fan of tha liks, so I was pretty happy when i checked Tash was doing something of his own, seing as in my opinion he was the best out the group. All I can say about this album is that if youre a fan of Tash get it, it's got more than enough on it to keep any fan of tha liks happy, including some crazy tracks: G's iz G's, Rap life and Nightlife and my favourite smokefest 99 which features Andre 3000& Big Boi.Bottom line if you dig Tash on the liks you wont be dissapointed with this."
4,Hot Album,"The solo debut of the Alkaholic's Tash is a good one. This album is filled with great beats and of course the witty lyrics of none other than the catashtrophe himself. With appearances by xzibit, phil da agony, raekwon, and more, this album is sure to satisfy any hip-hop fan."
3,"Pretty nice album, but a bit thrown together.","Tash hit pretty well with his first solo album. It's problem is it goes all over the place. Some of the tracks are five star songs, but some are even as low as one. The first track ""Ricochet"" is a terrible song and is not a good first impression for the listener. I don't feel that there was any practice put into it. On the other hand, tracks like ""G's Is G's"" featuring Kurupt, which has the two skillful lyricists trading rhymes, the East and West uniting ""Rap Life"", which features Raekwon, my favorite ""The Game"", which features Carl Thomas, and some others are classics. The problem is there are too many filler songs and skits, plus the other excellent track ""Pimpin' Ain't Easy"" has a God-awful chorus."
4,Tash is aight,"Tash solo album is a good CD but not every track. There's real good tracks like ""Rap life"", ""Smokefest"" and ""Gs is Gs"" but there's some tracks that sound like an average WestCoast Dre-like song (especially ""Fallin"" which has the same sample as Dre ""Next episode""). So, this CD is ok but not classic: it should be more than this CD for a classic release. Tash do your thang! You holdin it down for the West! You aight!"
3,Still a alcoholic,formely of the rap group the Alkoholiks tash left because he is ready to be a solo artist. Rap Life is good because he include some of his blue friends like kurupt the kingpin and snoop. G'z is G'z has been the only song on video so far.
5,"Tash's ""Rap Life"" Is Hott!","I have to tell you i was doubting this cd before i bought it, I got it and this one was hot and you should buy it also, this cd has some real funky beats and now that i think about it Tash has some nice rythm...Some outstanding songs on this CD are ""G's iz G's"" featuring Kurupt, ""Rap Life"" featuring Raekwon, ""Nightfall"", ""Fallin On"", ""Tash Rules"", ""Blackula"", and ""Bermuda Triangle""....All of these songs show great beats, GREAT rythm and everything else you need in the ""Rap Life""...Just trust me on this one, this thing is to hot to drop, buy it soon."
3,Heater last 2 years:( While it last it works great!,I loved the heater while it last. My heater just started blinking which I thought maybe had to do with temp change. Sadly not the case. I have found several other post on different fish forums where this has happened.
3,"Brilliant idea, but hasn't lasted","This was the bomb, heating the water as it went through pump system and combining the water intake and heater into one submerged unit...then it clunked out after a couple years. Didn't get what I paid for. 2.5 stars"
4,Very Good,"Have used it for 6 months and it has been very accurate. The only thing I don't like is its size, which becomes an issue when you consider the existence of external heaters."
2,Loved this heater...while it worked.,"Purchased this heater for a cichlid tank, set it up to keep the water temperature at about 79-80 degrees. Heater is very nice looking and the control knob seems to work well. The indicator light was a nice feature, flashing slow when the water temperature was very low, solid when heating and flashing fast if the water was too warm. Kept the temperature very stable for 3 weeks, at which time it became erratic, heating and then instantly flashing fast that the tank was too hot. Then it would shut off, flash that the tank was too cold, come back on, etc. This would all take place in a span of about 10 minutes. Obviously they have a problem with the thermostat as I have now read other sites with comments that are very similar. Warranty is a joke, as you have to ship it back at your expense along with $10 to cover their return shipping. I threw it out and replaced it with a Hydor in-line heater. No more Rena for me."
3,You need the book!,"I bought this book as I am a avid collector of American Brilliant Cut Glass. E.D. Libbey made some of the best. I need a book more on his earlier work then this book provided. This is to modern for me,I was wishing for a book of cut glass patterns and his methods and hopes for the 1890s. As a collector you need this one, but I hoped for more. Frank Davis"
4,A great book illustrating the importance of honesty.,"This is the story of a lonely little girl who longs to fit in after moving to a new town. She tells a lie to impress a new friend, and the lie takes on a life of it's own. My daughter and I read this book together (she is only 6), and we both loved it. My little girl felt she could really relate to Irma, and the idea of ""honesty"" was really grasped. There is quite a bit of humor in this book, and I belive the reader can really identify with the protagonist. I read this book as a child, and enjoyed it just as much as an adult."
5,TOUCHED AND RETOUCHED,"LONG AGO, WHEN MY KIDS WERE TINY THINGS, I HEARD ""LITTLE POTATOE"", AND IT HAS NEVER LEFT MY HEART. MY MEMORIES OF HOW I FELT, THE DREAMS FOR THE FUTURE, THE TEARS OF JOY, THE GRINS, AND THE WORRIES OF TRYING TO BE THE BEST DAD THERE COULD EVER BE (JUST LIKE MY DAD WAS TO ME!) ALL LOVINGLY RETURN WHEN I EVEN REMEMBER THIS SONG, MUCH LESS HEAR IT AGAIN.WHEN IN MY WALK OF LIFE, I AM LUCKY ENOUGH MEET A DEDICATED YOUNG FATHER DOING HIS BEST AS A DAD (AND I DO RUN ACROSS THEM, THANK GOD!), ""LITTLE POTATOE"" COMES BACK TO MY MIND AND I WANT TO SHARE IT. I FEEL THE BLESSING GO ON AND ON.THIS ALBUM DESERVES A REISSUE. THE SONG ""LITTLE POTATOE"" DESERVES A PLACE IN EVERY FATHER'S HEART."
4,What a great cd!,"I first heard Metamora when I was about 8 years old. There was a local college station that played them. Our family would sit around listening to the program while having Saturday night dinner. Now that I am a grown woman with kids of my own, I enjoy playing it while hanging out with my family. Little Potato still brings tears to my eyes when I remember my father singing it to me and now, when I sing it to my kids.It's a fun cd.I don't know if this will help anyone but I'll say that it has brought me years of listening pleasure."
5,Murder she wrote series,"Murder, She Wrote - The Complete Eighth SeasonII was very pleased with the DVD, I will purchase the earlier ""Murder she wrote"" Items later. I now have three of the series.Thanks for sending them so promptly. AngelQ"
3,Murder She Wrote 8th Season,the 1st CD holder was broken and there was no 1st CD in the case. The second CD was in the case but it started with part 2 of the show ending the missing 1st CD. I have not sent it back I thought because it was opened it may not be allowed.
3,Good but she has done better,After viewing several of these episodes on this season I realize Angela Lansbury was much better in the beginning seasons of Murder She Wrote. Later episodes tended to drag and get boring and they really misplaced her by taking her out of Cabot Cove. I still love Murder She Wrote but I will watch the beginning seasons more than the later seasons.
5,A classic mystery,"I was so happy to receive this season of Murder She wrote. It is true that I hope to one day own all 12 seasons but this box set had an episode on it that I only was able to see perhaps once. I never knew the title of it; Incident in lot 7, the one about the famous Bates House! I can watch this episode over and over and I will never get sick of it. It was so cool to be able to see it again after so many years!"
5,great mystery,I have alway loved Angela Lansbury as JB Fletcher also the stars that stared in the series All of the epesodis are great I wish you could have put some of those movies that came on the seasons as well hope this helpedKsathy Conner
3,"If you like Jessica Fletcher stories, you will love this","Of course it is excellent. It is about J. B. Fletcher and her interesting life in her unique fishing town where she knows everyone and is oh so clever in solving ""who did it"". Good supporting cast also."
3,continuing adventures of Jessica Fletcher,"Another good season of Murder She Wrote, with 21 episodes, but it seems overpriced for a show that old and that predictable. Still, they're entertaining to watch from time to time."
4,murder she wrote,Very pleased with the overall service. The package came in wonderful condition and on time right before Christmas as promised. Very satisfied.
3,The downward descent continues,"As far as I'm concerned, Season 6 was the beginning of the end for ""Murder She Wrote"". In that season, Jessica (Angela Lansbury) only appeared in 13 of the 22 episodes, with alternative ""detectives"" in the remaining episodes. Season 7 continues the descent. Although there are only five episodes in this season in which Jessica isn't the detective, the guest stars aren't as impressive as in the earlier seasons (in the earlier seasons it was rare for there to be an episode where I hadn't heard of at least one of the guest stars, while by this season, it had become quite common) and many of the ""regulars"" (including Seth and Grady) have mysteriously vanished. The stories aren't too bad, though, and, in fact, are almost as good as those in the earlier seasons. If you can cope with the shortcomings of this season, then you shouldn't be too disappointed."
5,DELICIOUS!,"Nothing like a show no blood, no violence, elegant...I miss shows like that on tv these days!Plus, Miss Angela leads it!Just delicious, perfect to relax and enjoy after a busy day!"
4,A Great Starter Navigator,I have found the Magellan Maestro 3100 to be a great addition on my dashboard. I have not had any reception problems and the mapping is great.The one thing I was wanting was the ability to download maps for hiking and off-road navigation and that is not available on this modelbut they never said it was. For general auto travel and GPS coordinates I don't think you could go wrong for the price($150). My next step---voice recognition.
4,LOw Price - HI performance,"I bought this unit because it was on sale...What a great bargin! I'm a Home Inspector so I need to find a new address every day. I have used this Unit for the last 3 weeks and it has been a life saver! The detour feature is great and only once did it have trouble finding an address. I just locked in on a near by number and the destination was easy to find once I got close. When you arrive ""anywhere"" you can lock in that location and put it in your address book for future reference.The ""go-home "" feature is also great and the unit re-routs in seconds if you miss a turn! As with the other reviews I think that the POI database is a bit skimpy but I really dont need to kown where every ATM in town is! This is the best $150.00 I have spent in a long time!I hope I can figure out a way to get map up-dates in the future, but I didnt read the manual yet...It worked so easy, Just plug and go!"
4,Great Value GPS,The Good:Product works very well.Maps are accurate.User interface is effective.Great display.The Not So Good:Sometimes sluggish with new route calculations.Battery life is fairly short.I have now bought two I have liked the device so much.
1,It will break avoid!,This is a terrible product mainly due to the power connector I've had this unit less than a year and it already can't be charged without constantly messing with the power connector. It died on me in the city today and I had a very hard time getting home as a result of this. When the unit worked it was great but the build quality is dismal.
3,dont try to load maps yourself,"i bought this unit it was fine at first but in some areas it looked like i was in the middle of a field, so i bought the new maps try to load them and guess what, it locked up so i sent it back to megellan and i had to pay shipping one way but they gave me new one, but once again tried to load the maps and again it locked up again so i called again ,payed to have it shipped again but here i sit waiting for it to return maybe this time with the new maps put in for me, but something tells me that that may never happen so be careful when buying these units it may or may not work for youMagellan Maestro 3100 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator"
4,GPS,Much better than expected for the amount paid.Almost as good as the factory GPS on my Navigator.
3,Magellan Maestro 3100,It works pretty good. The part I do not like is that at the Magellan site they do not have a way for updating free maps to it. It looks like you have to buy a sd card with maps on it then load them in and I thought the price was rather expensive. It could use more points of interest loaded in it. I was in Branson MO recently and the road we were on had been rerouted so there was no exit to rt65 at that point but it showed on Magellan map that it was still there.
4,"Great value, a bit sluggish with WinCE","The features of this little unit are great; the voice commands, the auto rerouting, the cheerful graphics. You get the mounting bracket and power supply too. The only downside is that it is running WinCE, which makes the operating system bloated and thus it tends to slow down every once in a while, especially on power-up. It can take 20-30 seconds for the screen to respond to a button press. But once it is ""warmed-up"" it operates fine. My guess is that the microprocessor they are using is a little underpowered to do the graphics and the satellite management. I'd recommend it anyways."
4,Works pretty well for the price,"Magellan Maestro 3100 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorBought this just before Christmas and it arrived just in time for a trip I was taking to Florida. It is easy to setup right out of the box, and use. Upon turning it on I got great satelite reception everywhere I go.The first time I input an address from the rental car place in Florida to my destination, it took me to a non-existent road and got me lost. This was extremely frustrating. Other than that time it has been dead on each time and has been very helpful. If you don't need all the bells and whistles of the latest model, this is just fine for basic use."
4,Seems great.,"Well, I've never used GPS Nav so, I probably wouldn't know what to compare it to. However, it's helped me out a couple of times already. I don't use it all the time, but when I do, it seems to work fine.The only thing I'm not crazy about, is the amount of time it takes to update between streets. It might also be that I drive too fast. When I'm going to speed limit, the updates are fine.For my first one, I'm happy. Can't go wrong for the price. It's bailed me out of sticky traffic situations with the alternative routes."
3,magellan saga,"Bought it, received, tried it once it, tried to update the software, the device crashed, sent it ot Magellan, haven't received it back and it has been days. I had called techsupport 2 times the only advice they could give me it was to send it to repair previously. Called Magellan wondering about it, they say they would send it back after the weekend, no more information avilable. Not happy. No Magellan...."
3,should have research a little more,"This GPS is ok, I don't like when i put an address in and then i decide to take a shorcut i know, then the gps will put me back to where i am suppose to be instead of pointing me to the direction of where i am at. I don't like having to go back. Say i am on I95 and i take rte301 my own way, the gps will show me how to get back to I95 and continue the way it told me to, instead of taking me to the place from rte 301. So research gps's before you buy. It is great folr finding someones home or office, but not for road trips with interuptions. If i am wrong about this item please tell me."
4,"Thin, Light, and Cheap","I've been testing this little guy out for week and I can't find much to complain about. It is my first GPS unit and I like it because it has a simple, easy-to-use interface. The instructions are loud and clear. There is an empty SD Memory slot that must be for something. It has 48 preloaded US state maps on it and a 750,000 points-of-interest database that is pretty good (8 out of 10 times it will find fairly small resturants that I quiz it for and it hasn't missed any gas stations yet). One thing it doesn't have is the Text-Speech function which extends the simple turn by turn voice to also read out loud individual street names or businesses. Then again, is it worth spending more money on a more sophisticated unit capable of constantly reading stuff out loud to you? Dunno--I'm happy with machines not doing so much talking myself."
4,Fantastic GPS for the Money,"My first GPS was a Magellan Roadmate 700 for $1000 a few years ago. Most of the time, it would take 15 to 20 minutes to acquire enough satelites to navigate. I just purchased the Maestro 3100 containing up-to-date (April 2007) maps from Amazon for $165 (it's now $150!). The new unit contains the newest chip (SirfStar III) which typically acquires enough satellites to navigate in 1 minute! The screen is a little on the small side, but if you want to spend more for the same technology, Nuvi 300,600, and 700 series has it for 3 to 5 times the price. Points of interest are a little skimpy, but for a 48 State high quality GPS with quick acquisition, this unit can't be beat."
2,It broke after 1 week,"When it was working, the product was nice to use and fun to play with. Then, it broke. The arrow on the screen which is supposed to represent your position, stopped updating. I flew down to LA and was hoping to use it to navigate my way around town. Unfortunately, the unit didn't work there either. I contacted customer support when I got back home, and it's in the process of (hopefully) being repaired right now."
3,good for the price,"For the price, this is a good product. However, it does not presently offer road updates. Therefore, any new roads and highways in the last year will not be on this unit. I might ultimately purchase a better one and give this to the kids. Given the cost, I won't mind if they loose it."
5,Just what expected,Delivery was quick and the the product is great. I have used the Garman GPS and this one cost less and is just as nice.
4,Magellan Maestro 3100,So many GPS systems on the market it's hard to pick. This one seems like one of the best deals for the price mainly because you can unplug it from the car and walk around with it or use it in another vehicle. Does have some flaws in the map we noticed on route to known destinations.
5,Never lost again,"I love it,dose everything that I need.Great price.The only way it could betteris if it could find my keys."
4,Magellan Maestro 3100,"an excellent product - so far quite easy to use and manage - easily carry in your shirt pocket, very accurate also. Just wish had a few more point of interest loaded like Shopping Malls, Hair cutters etc. Also, would have appreciated an option memory stick at the time of purchase and clearer instructions on loading the additional maps & point of interest etc."
4,great.,"this product is great, it took a few minutes to get it up and going. ive not have had a problem yet with it. it has taken me everywhere i want to go with ease."
2,useless,"bought to drive cross country, opened, started up, updated map ---- froze. never unfroze. seeing as i didnt have time to send it to the manufacturer we went out and bought a TOMTOM on sale - which was the same price, easier to use, and NEVER FROZE. ever."
3,A good GPS with some problems,"I bought this GPS a few weeks ago, and have yet to get lost. However, recently, the map has not showed the streets that I've been traveling on, but rather other countries. It still tells me the right directions, but says that I'm traveling in Russia or Chile. Hopefully I can resolve this problem because it gets really confusing."
2,Not the best,"This is not the best GPS out there. I tried to get to 3 different destination here in NYC and the directions were confusing. It is also slow, I remember one time I made a right turn and the device still did not update to the fact that I changed directions and it confused me because I thought I had to make another right turn. The only thing I can appreciate about this device is that from a cold start it connected within 5 seconds. The window mount is also nice and simple. But I am sending it back."
5,WOW!!!!,Just a god send on a recent trip through Boston. Can't imagine how we went on vacation before this.
1,LOW VOLUMN,"I have asked the tech support about the LOW VOLUMN and they said that ""what you hear is what you get"". Too bad they think this way since I can not hear the directions when driving with the radio on low low this unit is useless to me. Please check out other GPS's before you spend your money."
2,Expensive is not always better,"This unit is high end. Features are not. Hubby has a Nextar unit, and it charges from the PC, has much more user friendly mount, carry case, all things this Magellan does not. I returned the unit to the seller and they graciously agreed to send me a cheaper unit that has twice as many features. Very pleased with seller, not with unit."
1,DISAPPOINTED,WHEN THE UNIT ARRIVED IT WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE. I WAS TRULY DISAPPOINTED SINCE THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY SON'S BIRTHDAY. I RETURNED THE ITEM AND HAVE TRIED CALLING SEVERAL TIMES TO FIND OUT THE STATUS OF THE RETURN WITH NO HELP FROM THERE TECHNICAL GROUP. I AM ONLY HOPING I GET THWE UNIT BACK.
1,"Not recommended, very Unreliable","I do not recommend to buy this product at all, i want to return it.I bought this GPS 3 months back, the first month it was fine, i was happy with it but after that it was horrible. Sometime it will just hang in the middle of the way and will not restart easily, sometimes it does not show the map at all, for any destination entered it says 'Destination is not in the maps'. I cannot rely on this GPS anymore, now i just check the maps on internet before going out in case it just hangs in the middle and leave me with no option."
5,Great Product,Great product for the price. Can be a little confusing setting in addresses at first but you get the hang of it in a very short time.The 3100 has taken the stress out of finding your destination.
1,Inferior to Garmin Nuvi,"Do yourself a favor and spend the extra 80 bucks and get a Garmin. With no text to speech, you will be finding yourself straining to see the poorly lit screen while you try to focus on the road, and without map updates, this product will be obsolete in a short period of time. The routes provided are sometimes very peculiar, often forcing me to make U-turns on divided highways in order to reach my destination. In products such as these, the engineering makes all the difference, and that is where the Garmin products excel."
1,"Short life span, don't waste your money","I have only had the 3100 for one year with infrequent use. Now it will not start up even though it is getting power. I checked the Magellan site and they state that they only service units under warranty. This one is abount 30 days beyond the 1 yr warranty. They suggest that you buy a new one after one year which I will do, but it will not be a Magellan product."
4,THE BEST BUY!,I had used the Magellan Maestro 3100 my sister has and was impressed with the unit. I needed a GPS unit and stupidly bought a Tom Tom unit because of the price. What a big mistake! I am real happy I bought this unit to replace the Tom Tom unit. Buy this GPS!
3,IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED!,"OVERALL THIS IS A GREAT BUDGET FRIENDLY GPS. I HAD MINE FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. AFTER BEING DROPPED ABOUT 50 TIMES, MY CHARGER INPUT COMPLETELY BROKE OFF INSIDE THE UNIT. MY WARRANTY WAS UP, SO IT IS JUST A GPS SHELL NOW. THE OS IS NICE BECAUSE YOU CAN INPUT ZIP CODES UNLIKE THE COMPARABLE GARMIN. MAP MAY NEED SOME UPDATING, AND THERE IS NO TEXT TO SPEECH, BUT IT WAS STILL FUNCTIONAL FOR IT'S PURPOSE."
3,Way behind other gps companies,"This Magellan is easy to use and has nice features, but very inacurate and one of the most expensive and complicated units to update I've ever had. Definitely will go back to Garmin."
2,Magellan GPS,The internal battery of my Magellan 3100 died after only 18 months without being exposed to extreme heat or cold. Emails to Magellan were not answered.
2,Thank Goodness It Was Stolen!,"We prefer the TomTom because it has an easier to use (and more thorough) 'points of interest' and 'maps' program. This Magellan Maestro became a headache when we had to utilize without any addresses ...especially when many streets were not listed on the map function. As a sidenote, never leave your GPS in the car...don't even leave it in the glove compartment!"
2,i wuld never buy megallen again,i bought this on a deal on amazon but i repent it very limited poi s went offroading froze didnt recover for weeks cant move map up and down from your current location. me being a mother love parks and then zoos in parks cant find it lot of resturants that i go are missing and i live in orange county. i dont know i wuldnt advise tp buy it u shuld tale word and avoid this
1,magellan 3100,this gps could not find it's way out of the box never mind tell me where i wanted to go. very little pois. one of the worst gps on the market as far as i am concerned.please don't waste your money or your time.Magellan Maestro 3100 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator
4,Good product for the price.,"I got what I expected for the price. It has performed as expected. I noticed that it would occasionally indicate a fuel station that was no longer present, or wouldn't have a newer road in its data base, but I can live with that. It has never steered me wrong. The controls are intuitive, and the screen is sufficiently detailed for average eyes. A brief run through of the instructions and 5 minutes of hands on practice and you are a pro. I have gotten good battery life. It isn't fancy, but I didn't expect it to be for under $200. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,Very Poor Design,"I got this as an early Christmas present about a week ago and have been endlessly frustrated with it. First, the maps are 15 months old and several major are missing. Second, it didn't come with a AC charger so can only be charged in the car. Third, it is set to never turn off, so the battery is ALWAYS low. Fourth, when I did find a software, the battery was low so I am currently trying to charge the piece of junk in my because the software won't update unless the Maestro is fully charged...very frustrating!!!"
4,Great for the price,I have used my Magellan with great success.Not being the one for great written directionsit has helped me a great deal.My only complaint are the instructions with the packageneed to be more informative re the need to downloador to upgrade.
4,Review of Magellian GPS 3100,"Works well.Acquires signal fast, maps equal to other units.In addition to voice prompt of turns, it also signals via beeps right vs. left turn.Handy device, well worth the price."
4,Magellan Maestro 3100 GPS navigator,"I purchased this item for my daughter for her birthday because I already had one. It's convenient and for the price, it has great features. I love it!!"
1,Cheap price but not worth it.,"This thing crashes every time I try to use it, it doesn't hold a charge,and now the screen seems to be receiving signals when no one is even touching it. Don't bother with the Magellan, stick with Garmin or Tom Tom."
3,Magellan GPS,I didn't realize that the GPS would be so small. It's OK to carry in my pocket or purse but I would never be able to see it mounted on my car's dashboard.
2,Don't waste your money especially when there are newer ones out there...,"I had this magellan for close to two years. From the first day I got it, I could never use it without having the car charger attached. It would always say ""battery critically low"" or just shut off. I tried to hook it to my computer to download an update, it never would update. I really got fed up when the touchscreen started working only when it wanted to, which is not good when you don't know where you're going, and are trying to get directions from a gps with no touchscreen! I finally just said it's time for a new one, so I sold it to gazelle, which buys old electronics. I just got a new garmin nuvi 285wt from Amazon! The shipping was extremely fast and I love the new Garmin. It's totally an update from the magellan, it's very user friendly, and definitely has more up to date maps. The magellan 3100 gets a big thumbs down from me for two years of usage."
1,Only worked for 7mos,"I bought this unit new from a vendor through amazon. after seven months, its quit operating saying battery critically low... i went through on the hoops, resetting the unit and even installing a new battery and it continues to be un-usable with this error message. For the amount of money paid for the new unit, it is just unacceptable. I really like the ease of use and features better than other models out there that i have tried, tom-tom, etc. However when quality and reliability is so very poor, its just not worth the money."
2,No Major Retailers in the POI's,"There are no major retailers in the Points of Interest. None of the home improvement stores, none of the discount retailers, none of the electronics stores, none of the office supply stores (Amazon won't let me mention them by name in this review, but you know who I am talking about).I found this very frustrating, other than that it is a good unit for the price."
4,Magellan GPS,"I bought four of these for my adult kids. They are great entry level units to start them out learning electronic navigation. The Maestro 3100 is discontinued, so I do not know how long Magellan will support them. The delivery was prompt."
2,Crashes/locks up a lot,"For the price, this GPS unit is fine; it does the basics in a nice, small package. Unfortunately, there are drawbacks such as a lack of text-to-speech (it doesn't read out street/road names, but what do you expect for the price?) and an extremely small number of points of interest.More distressingly, I can't get this unit to work properly, as it continually locks up and reboots itself when doing even the simple tasks, such as calculating a route or finding points of interest. In addition, occasionally, all the roads from the map would suddenly disappear. Odd. Perhaps a firmware upgrade would remedy this, but I expect a product like this to work fine out of the box."
3,ok if you're patient,"I recieved it as a gift . Very happy at first . Sometimes it takes long to calculate route . Also when you first turn it on , it sometimes has the last address you turned it off at . I've already had it take 5 mins for it to get the correct map . Thats just a couple of the problems . Sometimes it works great , sometimes not . Recommend , i'm not sure ."
2,GPS Navigator,"As the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for"". This is an ok system; however, it did not list Church's, or Shopping Malls in the Points of Interest listing. It also does not recognize newer addresses reassigned by 911 addressing system. I put in an address that it told me I had reached my destination when in fact it was on the opposite side of the street and another 1/2 block away. But for the big picture, it would get me into the area I was searching for."
2,Magellan Maestro 3100 - Fair,"Bought this on a friends recommendation. Also bought a TomTom at the same price. The Magellan is not as good as the TomTom. The maps in the Magellan are out of date and you can't edit them, on the TomTom the maps are current and you can edit them. TomTom is more user friendly and I like the display better. For the money, get the TomTom due to much better support, friendliness of use and current map."
4,Price and value can't be beat,This product was a good value from magellan and a better one from amazon.It was cheaper.As with all of my purchases from amazon has been terrific.
4,Good For The Price,"This is my first GPS, so, I have no way to compare this unit to others. I had been hesitant to spend the money on a GPS, until I found this unit advertised locally for $199. The windshield mount is nice and sturdy, and it is quick to set-up. I had it operational by the time I left the store parking lot without reading the manual.The display is bright and easy to read, and it immediately picked up several satelites.If you intentionally miss a turn, it quickly recalculates and displays an alternate route, but if you ask it to calculate a route to a new destination while driving, the unit hangs up and reboots. That may be normal for GPS systems, I just don't know.I only found one brief mention in the manual that describes use of the included USB cable to charge the battery. Seems like a strange reason for including a USB cable but no AC charger.Overall, considering the price and ease of use, I am pleased with the Maestro 3100 and would recommend it."
2,Random freeze-up,"The software is still buggy. It froze up for no particular reason, in the middle of driving. In my recent 800-mile trip, it froze up once on each way. So get a paper clip handy in the car in case you need to reset it."
1,Cheap price but....,"Not a good gps.I travel alot and end up loosing my gps once a year or so. Thus, I have to buy the entry level units. This is the 5th gps that I've owned.Likes:PriceVery thinDislikes:Can't find many streets in the search even though when you arrive it then know the street name. What's the point of a gps if it only can direct you to some roads.Takes me on random 4 turn detours, then when I look back, all I needed to do was continue going straight. Weird.They say ""750k poi's) like it's something to brag about. It's actually the lowest number of poi that I've heard of for a gps.Battery is terrible. I have to bring the charger with me, even for a two-day business trip.Sorry Magellan, the nuvi 200 is a couple years older, but blows this out of the water. Just disappointed that I have to go return this thing now."
4,very good price/quality/function,"I tried your Magellan 3100 on a 2000 miles trip. I found it easy to use and accurate.Negative points:- It do not display the battery level on the main screen. The only way to find the battery level is to access the settings option which is annoying. Also, no warning when battery is reaching the lowest limit.- The maximum level for voice sometimes is hard to hear in a noisy traffic.I should mention that during my trip, two times GPS location got stuck, the only way to (re)get the current location was to reset the device."
2,"They look cute, but not good quality","I purchased this shoes because they looked so cute, but they are not glued together properly, they broke on the first time I used them!!!"
2,Taylor's Master Guide to Gardening,"Overall, I was disappointed by the book. The information provided is accurate but limited. Of the some 400 Primula species that exist, 5 are listed, similarly, the 70 Aquilegias are covered by only 4 species and the over 500 Potentillas have only one species described. Granted this is a ""one-volume reference"" with photos of the 1000 so-called ""best plants"", the book does not claim to be exhaustive. This book ranks low in my library. The photographs are often out of focus and the colours are poorly produced. The brief plant descriptions are separated from the photographs and are not overly helpful. The book may be useful to the less ardent gardeners of the world but given the hefty price tag, I would spend my money elsewhere. Anyone taking this volume to the nursery to buy plants would only have the barest notion of what to buy. I would urge others to purchase the smaller more focused guides in the Taylor's series."
1,Don't buy this TV if you're expecting a rebate...,"While the product itself is OK, I purchased this TV back in November 04 and am still waiting on my rebate from Syntax. Customer service is poor and I suspect I will never receive my $100. Avoid them at all costs."
2,Did not received my $100 rebate either.,"I too have not received my $100 rebate either. In several emails with Customer support, they claim the rebate can not be given without ""proof"" of delivery within a very small 15-day rebate period. Unbelievable.If they are this hard to work with to get a rebate that I am entitled to, I sure hope I don't have a warranty claim, I can imagine how hard that would be.Overall, picture is ok, I also get a loud buzz if you change the settings and the remote is badly designed. But be ready to have your rebate denied for any possible reason."
1,AMAZON RIPP OFF 3 DAYS BEFORE X-MAS,"Tried to order this TV 4 times. Each time amazon cancelled the order for one reason or another and said they would credit my cards back for the sale. 3 days before christmas whet to pick up my lay-aways and my credit card is over limet. Turns out amazon has over $4,000 in holds on my credit card for orders that THEY CANCELD AND HAD NEVER BEEN SHIPPED. Nine kids and amazon ruined our christmas.PS My credit card said that amazon could cancel the holds put on my credit card in ONE DAY if they wanted. Of course 4 days later they are still using my money.PSS Forget trying to call amazon slow e-mail only WORTHLESS SUPPORT.RECOMMENDATION: -FORGET AMAZON- Do a google search for Target discounts and get a 10 percent off code. I found one in less than 30 seconds. Go to target.com and get 10 percent off and free freight. At least they have a phone number for support."
3,What TV ships without a sleep timer these days?,"Ordered this TV as a perfect compliment to a new guest room. Shocked to not find obvious access to the sleep timer on the remote...I called Syntax technical support and found out that the 20"" in fact does NOT have a sleep timer (contrary to what is referenced in other reviews here). Too bad...as this is a really well-priced LCD TV. Only other issue was a single dead pixel - right in the middle of the screen unfortunately. Had to return this unit...but would consider other Syntax / Olevia TVs in other sizes."
4,Great bang for the buck.,I gave this 4 stars since I have not received my Amazon rebate yet. Picture quality is very good expecially the HDTV. I truly don't think the extra grand or two for a brand name LCD will be worth it once you view the picture quality. I highly recommend buying this TV.
4,Syntax Olevia 27&#65533;,"Had this monitor for 3 months now. Used almost exclusively as a computer monitor and xbox monitor. Great for xbox using progressive component. For the most part very good for computer using vga and 1280x720 with ATI Radeon Video. Ran into huge problem when I upgraded my video card to Nvidia 6600gt. Although the card says it supports 1280x720 the picture looks like it is running at a non-native resolution. (very blurry similar to running at a resolution other then 1280x720). As far as the tv side, the picture quality is horrible using the standard catv inputs on the back. I have not tried hooking this up to a hdtv decoder or satalite but would assume those would look very nice given the quality of the xbox signal. Overall I like the monitor and for under $1000 it is probably one of the best buys out there for a 27 inch monitor/tv."
3,time,"The TV is great, minus the fact that I received it with some dead pixels (bright green dot in the picture). I contacted Syntax their warranty policy covers seven pixels, so I contacted the vendor, the people I ordered through and they said I could send it back for a replacement. Oh wait, you ordered through Amazon, we cannot supply a replacement, you however can send that one back for a refund and then order a new one. Long story short if I would have ordered straight through the vendor I wouldn't have to go approx two weeks without a TV. My advise, when you buy this TV, BUY IT THROUGH THE VENDOR, not Amazon."
5,Just right!,"The packaging for this unit was outstanding. I was concerned about ordering such a fragile item online but it arrived in perfect condition. Picture quality is flawless, breathtaking?. Sound is excellent. Overall it's a terrific value for the money. Best of all, it's not too big, and not too little."
4,"20""- For small rooms and aspirations","I too found configuring the color to be difficult on this one, and the limited resolution for serving as a computer monitor was noticable. But overall, it's many inputs and ease of use are big plusses, I've heard it uses standard VESA-100 mounts and its not too heavy to carry between rooms. The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark. A 20"" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation. There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set. I think it will allow me to wait until the larger, higher resolution sets get more affordable, or until I'm in a bigger apartment."
3,Tough to configure,"I find calibrating the set difficult. There is a definite blue push and find it better to set the color mode to ""warm"". After countless hours fiddling with contrast, brightness, saturation and sharpness, I just can't seem to get the picture I've read in other reviews. The blacks are washed out (like most LCDs) and it has a tough time processing fast movement. DVD through the component input looks good. Standard DirecTV through the S-video is disappointing. Perhaps I'm missing something. Any feedback is appreciated."
4,Really Like It!!,"I was going to buy the Sony 17"" LCD XBrite monitor but when I saw that this monitor was also a TV and had stereo speakers I couldn't pass it up. The one thing that isn't mentioned in the manual is that it requires at least 128MB on the video card to work properly. For my needs (and the money), I am very happy with it."
1,It has a short lifespan,"This Tv worked great for a year and a half. It progressively started going black, and recently went completely black. While you can hear the audio the picture is gone, no picture, not even on. Very disappointing. So to all of you gushing over this tv right now, be afraid, be very afraid."
5,A great TV at a great price,"This LCD HDTV would be a great television even at a higher price, but at it's current price point it's hard to see why anyone would buy anything else. I got mine the day after Thanksgiving, and have been watching it every day since. I have a good friend with an Aquos, and though it's far more expensive, I can't see any difference. I sure don't miss my old CRT TV . . .I agree with the criticism that the volume is too high at the minimum setting - but it isn't a major annoyance. I believe they've fixed the remote-code issue as well, but in case you are still wondering, the volume, on off and channel selection use RCA code 001.Buy it now - once you go flat you'll never go back."
2,look elsewhere,"Price was very good ($389), good features, but doesn't deliver on image.The screen has a film across it, causing unacceptable light reflections and a bit of wavy distortion. It states HDTV ready, but when hooking up to my HDTV tuner using component cables, I could not get the TV to synchronize on the 480p signal (it displayed two images - side by side). Forget about 720p or 1080i - no image at all. Picture from satellite using S-video connector was not impressive. This unit is going back (even my non-techno wife complained about it). By comparision, I do like my Sony 50"" HDTV LCD rear projection."
3,Olevia,This TV shows well but is very aggravating because the remote sensor is defective. You have to stand directly in front of the TV to turn the channel or adjust the volume. Amazon have not responded to my request for a refund.
2,Over Priced TV,"I use this display in my line of work. The quality is generally above average if not that great. The color is not as bright or vivid but the ability to receive and play HD programs does let one peek into the future of digital programmings and that itself is an enjoyable experience.The LT30HV has considerable weakness in the DVI mode, often the display will exhibit no picture or incorrect color scheme, 6 months to a year after opening the box. For the majority, this would not be an issue since only very few consumers use DVI mode to watch TV.However a larger concern is that there has been a number of TV that exhibits a water mark patch behind the display screen, the size can vary from 20% to 50% of the screen. This slight discoloration can take the fun out of having the LCD TV.For the price advertised here, it is definately not worth it."
1,problems with remote control,"just bought 27"" syntax olevia. the picture quality is good. however, i have the infamous remote control problem that many 27 and 30"" models seem to have. the remote only works from 2 feet. needless to say it was not what i expected. i'll try contacting their support and have it fixed and post an update."
2,Poor Clarity and Bad remote,"Read the reviews before you buy this. The tv DOES have a horrible problem with the remote. I tried standing two feet back, didn't work. You must place the remote less then 1 foot away for it to be used.The picture on my 25"" tv that is 8 years old is better than this piece of junk. Don't waste your money. Don't be frugal like me and think you can get a deal on this thing because you're better off buying something else"
2,ok but can't watch tv,"check online forums..I am among the manyOlevia owners who find the picture justfine until the screen goes black..its notworth plugging/unplugging (over and over)..inexpensive but never again and techsupport ranges from unavailable (phone systemproblems) to ""sorry..you're on your own"". Iowned the TV for a little over a year beforeit went black."
4,Have had two of these for 4 years - works great - but not perfect,Length:: 0:13 MinsThey work pretty good - but the problem is that after much much use - there is burn in issue - of course that is true with almost all LCDs. We have had no other problems with one exception. The tvs are very sensitive to low signal level. At 1080i - it doesn't like component switches or direct connects from the PS3. It cuts out and fritzs. I have a video of this I will try to upload.I would also like to know if other people have firmware upgrades past the initial one that allowed the tv's to work with scientific atlanta remote controls???Michael
1,Lack of useful technical support,"Problem was that the component video input (YPP) was non functional. I did not find it possible to contact a real person at technical support and the ""phone tree"" menu is impenetrable, probably by design. The email input option for requests resulted in an insulting,lame response to the effect ""If you connected your tuner to the YPP input, it should work."" I would not have requested assistance if it had worked! The component video output from the same tuner works fine with another HDTV I own."
1,Not Reliable and Customer Service is Poor,"Everything your read about the picture quality is true... however, this product just isn't reliable. Cost me another $600 to get it fixed and it isn't even 18 months old. I am sure I am not alone since you can see these on that famous auction site may with similar power issues. Customer service from this company is also very poor. If I had it to do over I would not have purchased this product and I probably should not have spent the money to get it fixed. I think it will be just a matter of time before some of these 5 star reviews begin to change their tune."
2,Not a good buy,"I have a 30"" audiovox LCD already, and I was shocked at how much better the picture on the audivox was compared to the Syntax. The product specs say the Syntax is a better telivision but the proof is in the picture. The picture quality was very poor and the colors are just not normal tones. If you plan on hooking up your cable with this TV, buy a differnet TV. The picture is very poor quality. I was very disapointed."
2,WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A $1200 LCD TV,"I too have experienced what Gary Bergman has described in his review. On Occassion, my Syntax LT30HV's screen goes black. I simply unplug it for a few seconds, plug it back in and the picture re-appears. But I can't complain, this TV cost $1000 less than a major brand. Todays price is even better. Makes a good TV for the kids room.James Dorsey, I too have not received my $100 rebate either. The manufature online rebate status has no record of my rebate.Amazon should look into this since they sold and promoted the rebate."
1,YOU WILL REGRET BUYING THIS TV,"I bought this tv to surprise my husaband when he returned from the Middle East. We had it 2 years. It now goes black all the time. I'm a Television Consumer reporter and would never recommend this TV. It didn't have that many bad reviews two years ago, but it does now. Do Not Buy This TV! Read the reviews. Works for awhile and then goes black. Invest in something better. It will eventually break on you too."
1,Distortion in Aspect except 4::3,"You'll see a circle as a circle only on Aspect 4:3. The other aspect ""zoom"" make the circle looks like an egg. No adjustment in vertical or Horizontal. The manual stated the ""ZOOM"" will enlarge the 4:3 without distortion. But it is not, it enlarged more in Horizontal than Vertical. Tech Support said that it is pre-set in manufacture, they can't correct it. I need the ZOOM aspect to watch the wide screen movie.I compare it with Westinghouse, the Westinghouse is better, more options, easier use on Remote.Some credits I have to give to both TV is that No Dead Pixel."
3,WARNING! DOES NOT SUPPORT HI DEF!,"If you have your hear set on Hi-def, don't buy this. The description states that you can watch Hi-def with the right equipment, but I could not get my hi-def cable box to work with this TV. A quick call to Syntax tech suport confirmed that the 20-inch model of this TV does NOT support High Definition broadcasts, despite the fact that the description says so and the correct inputs are on the back. If anyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong, tell me!"
2,Problems with two different units,"I bought my first LT30HV LCD TV in December, 2004. After about 8 or 9 months I would continually lose the picture. After several discussions with Customer Service (they had me try various things to correct the problem), they decided to ship me a new TV. I received it in early October, 2005 & everything was fine - at first. About 10 months later, the set started going black after it was first turned on & I had to turn it off & then on again. Over the course of the next couple of months, this problem got progressively worse. Now, I sometimes have to turn it off & on 10 to 20 times before it will stay on. So, I have had two sets -- neither of which worked a full year. Also, I found out that the second set that was sent to me was a refurbished set. I have spoken with technical support and customer service on many occasions but they refuse to do anything about it because it is ""out of warranty""."
1,"THIS CD COULD'VE BEEN BETTER, BUT........","When i bought this cd, i had high hopes for it. After playing it several times, i realized that it was not the cd for me. It had some good songs, but not enough of them. It had a few outstanding arrangements. This cd could have been better with more selective song selection and better arranging. Maybe in the future we can have some of both. I love you Michael, but this cd doesn't work."
1,Volvo Dealers REFUSE TO PROGRAM USED Fobs,"Don't waste your money on the Volvo used fobs. The dealerships WILL NOT program them. After purchasing a NEW FOB from the DEALER, for 218.00, we NOW HAVE A WORKING FOB FOR OUR VOLVO. Would like to have my money back from the seller of the USED FOB, but they refused."
4,Its hard to review this,"I absolutely love He-Man and grew up with this cartoon as a kid. I am in the military and love my PSP for traveling and have a very extensive umd collection. I can say that I own the complete original series on DVD and the show holds up great, but only having five episodes for the price makes me wanting more every time that I watch it. The five episodes were chosen by the fans but I don't agree that they were the best, and there are so many episodes that are lacking. I know from other umd's that the storage space is there to put more episodes on it, or even give two discs like Aeon Flux. Some of the episodes are out of left field like Bad Seed, but the show is still great enough for me to enjoy what there is. Fun enough for the road and something to watch, but if you want He-man i recomend the DVD set for about the same price as this."
1,What the hell,"I have no clue as to why sony let someone release this. I bought a psp for this crap?! seriously, they should consider their approach on this system and realize that if they continue this trend, it will become another victim of nintendo."
1,I couldn't build this model!,"This model kit became impossible for me to complete! It was so hard, and the directions seemed to make no sense, that I wrote an email to the distributor. They responded that they were sorry; it was beyond their control, they were dealing with lots of quality complaints, etc. -- I didn't want my money back, I just wanted to understand how to build the darn thing. They couldn't help me. Oh, and I'm a fairly experienced model builder, so I was surprised."
1,Authors Should FollowTheir Own Rules,"This book was a disapointment! I have suffered with migraine headaches for years. And I usually make two different dinners each meal--one for my family and one for me. I was hoping to find some recipes I could make that everyone would be able to eat. This book starts out identifying foods that possibly ""trigger"" headaches, ie., citrus, broadbeans, raw onions, caffeine, etc. You are then informed to avoid these foods. Then the authors print out recipes THAT HAVE THESE SAME FOODS AS MAIN INGREDIENTS!What a waste of my money this book was. I am disgusted."
1,Foods don't cause migraine,"This book perpetuates and exploits the myth that foods cause or trigger migraines. No food has ever been demonstrated to cause, promote, precipitate (""trigger"") or aggravate migraine. Beyond a placebo effect, dietary restriction is ineffective as a treatment for headache. (The exceptions are foods containing caffeine or alcohol, both of which are more properly regarded as drugs.) Migraine patients should eat a healthy, varied diet, and not deprive themselves of freedom, enjoyment and nutrition because of an outdated and mistaken belief."
5,Truth is a Pathless Land,"A lot of information in a very small book, bigger books have said less! Dr. Clarke is not trying to adhere to some established way of writing a book, he broke that mold along time ago. You would do well to read this book!"
2,Someone's got to weight the average review...,"Ugh, okay I get that Ms. Tessaro grew up in Pennsylvania but has lived in London for many years now-so why does her heroine who is fresh off the plane from Ohio speak like she was born and raised in Hyde Park? I would expect someone who has never lived in America to write like this, but clearly Ms. Tessaro has no excuse. There were too many extraneous bodies and I didn't care about any of the characters. I've been burned one too many times, this is the last time I fall for an over-hyped review of any British book."
3,Not 'chick lit',"This book may get lumped in with the chick lit genre, but really, it's not. There's far too much tragedy and not near enough humor to qualify this as 'chick lit', and that, of course, is fine.Sometimes I found it hard to connect with Evie and her band of misfits that came and went out of her life; it felt many times like I was reading this book at a distance. Maybe some of the characters cluttered up the landscape.I appreciated the Robbie/Alice character and her on/off friendship with Evie. I could really sense the frustration in both of them toward each other (for different reasons). The revelation at the end was not surprising - more expected than anything. Even so, it wrapped up nicely, if bittersweet, in the end."
2,Not impressed.,"This is not a book that I would recommend. While it may have one or two good points, it has an overall negative tone that radiates off of each page. The title is wonderful and it is too bad that it is used on this book. I was expecting more from a book with this title."
4,This Ain't No Dead Horse,"1989's ""A Dead Horse,"" the fourth album from drummer Anton Fier's studio group The Golden Palominos, is an excellent album with very strong pop-rock of both the down-to-earth & the ethereal kind. Fier's two main collaborators this time out are singer-songwriters Robert Kidney (who handles the down-to-earth material) and Amanda Kramer (who sings the dreamier-sounding stuff), and they both do great, including Kidney's confident turns on ""Wild River"" and ""Lucky,"" while Kramer (who sounds quite a bit like Natalie Merchant) works vocal wonders on such songs as ""Shattered Image"" and the stunningly beautiful ""Darklands."" Great songs and performances make ""A Dead Horse"" a solid offering from the ever-changing Golden Palominos."
3,New Wave Detour,"I guess you gotta be in the mood. Alexandra Kramer's 4 songs sound like gregorian chants with a beat - spiritual, vague, and echoey. Robert Kidney's songs sound more like REM, but with lyrics that seem like to consturcted on the fly. Sometimes I am enchanted by this construction (""A Letter Back"" in particular) but more often it seems boring. GP has done better."
3,concentrates on 19th and 20th centuries,"almost half the book covers the 19th and 20th centuries, leaving 140 pages for the other 5000 years...what coverage there was seemed good, however."
3,Good...but I'm not sure if I trust all the info,"Like other reviews have said, this book is very clear, concise, and READABLE (especially considering that it is a history book). However, this is the first sentence of Chapter 1: ""China, 3,600,000 square miles, is about the same size as the United States and SECOND ONLY TO RUSSIA IN AREA."" The last part of that sentence is stupidly wrong. It is a very very very dumb mistake. One would think that by the 4th EDITION (!!!!!!!!!!!) they would have gotten it right, but no.....So because of that sentence, while reading, I found myself wondering how much more information in the book was incorrect. That's not something you want to be thinking while reading a supposedly nonfiction book...."
3,"No table of content, decent translation","After buying this collection I realized that there is no table of contents, which makes it problematic to navigate. Granted, most poems only have a number in Latin numerals as their title, but still.I was happy to recognize the poems and look through them. The language used in this translation is showing its age though. It can be argued that this is a good illustration of the text's age, from 87 - 54bc, but in my opinion it would help present day readers to have a more modern language version available.If you are looking for a version of Catullus' poems to browse through and don't need to look up specific texts then it'll do just fine - Catullus' emotional and at times graphic language comes through just fine."
3,SUM GOOD VIBES INCLUDED,"I RECENTLY BROUGHT THE CD. AT FIRST LISTEN IT IS HARD TO GET A TASTE OF IT. YOU GOTTA SORT OF JUST PUT THE CD IN AND LET IT PLAY ALL THEY WAY THROUGH WITHOUT SKIPPING TO YA FAVORITE SONGS. TO FULLY APPERICATE THE SOULFUL SOUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN HANDPICKED BY SOME OF THE GREATEST SURFERS GOING ROUND E.G Zane Harrison, Joel parkinson, Layne Beachley you have to let the music flow through from one song to they other. SUM GREAT SONGS FOR PARTYS INCLUDED IN THIS CD"
3,not working yet,"been using product for 3 weeks, polish still chips. makes a shinny top coat, but polish still chips with normal wear."
5,This really works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I could never grow nails. They would always peel and split. This product really works! I now have longer nails.
4,Duri Cosmetics Rejuvacote,Used for only a few weeks but it is making my nails stronger. I've worn arylic nails for about 15 years and think rejuvacote is going to really improve my nails.
4,Required Reading!!!!!!!,"This should be required reading for educators in schools in urban communities - then distilled and made a part of curriculum. Truly shameless how this counter-culture has snaked its way into urban living. Immoral, illegal behavior is evident all around us. Rap music literally deifies violence and misoginy. No reprimands, no consequences and the beat goes on"
3,Nothing New.,"Im black, and i figure this book was written for me, and ive learned nothing new from this. Yes we are exploited, Yes we often have backwards priorities, but all you have to due is turn on the T.V. or the radio to know this. What the book lacks is depth, the topics are never really explored past the surface, and as a result don't have the impact they could have. I like Cora's writing stlye but maybe she bit off more than she could chew with this one."
1,Poorly written pseudo-essay,"Beginning with the cover, you can see the low-level hackneyed un-talent that went into putting this tome together. Is it a new, American, or black phenomenon that people of poor character revel in their lack of sophistication? This is behavior that spans generations on humanity. It is neither note-worthy or presented in a note-worth fashion. An unremarkable book on an unremarkable topic."
2,Personal Notebook,"This book is short on information, and long on the author's personal thoughts. It's not hateful, because she doesn't exploit, but it's boring and tiresome to hear her doing little more than flinging out her own jazzy rhetoric instead of providing facts and details about what's really going wrong with black classlesness. Apparently she had a good idea, seeking to report on why and how black inner city culture glorifies staying down, but the message is presented in a look-at-what-I-can-do style that is very disappointing. She's much too much giddy with her own Hoo Ha reflections, such as her chronically annoying ""(I'm ghetto),"" and ""(I'm not ghetto)"" closings to every paragraph where she demonstrates a personal preference - and there are far too may of them. If you want to learn all about Cora Daniels' thinking process, Ghettonation is the book for you. If you want to find out, as I did, some basic information on the offputting black underculture, wait for someone else to report it."
2,Good Overview! Not A Lot Of details! Kind Of Weak Presentation1,Cora Daniels book Ghettonation was a book I purchased after seeing her on The O'Reilly Factor.I should of paged through the book before I purchased it but I did not! It is really not a good book for detail info; and it only provides minor images on the Ghetto life style. The book has alot of weaknesses. No detail exploration is done on the subject at all; but just overviews of people she has met and things she has experience in her daily life. Very weak presentation. I don't think it would pass as a term paper for Sociology class at a major university. Format is loose and not structured. I cannot believe it was written by a professional writer!
2,Too lightweight,"I would have read this book in an afternoon had it been better at keeping my attention. It felt like a long magazine article, but without any hard data behind it. I enjoyed the author's personal insights, but I would have liked some ""meat"" to accompany it. The author tries to walk a fine line: condemning the negative aspects of urban culture while not wishing to alienate herself from those who accept it. The usage of ""I'm ghetto"" was meant to convey the fact that the ghetto mentality is something that creeps into all of our lives, but its constant repetition seemed simultaneously apologetic and a proud wink to those whom would alienate her otherwise.I was greatly impressed by the author's character. I would have liked for her to expound when voicing her well-justified condemnation of a culture that, in her words, ""celebrates mediocrity."" Perhaps a second work will fill that void."
3,Misplaced Word,"The word simp is found on page 1552, right inbetween USIA and Uskudar. What's up with that? This is a fairly blantant error that makes me suspect. I'll stick to Websters."
1,What happened?,I too am EXTREMELY disappointed in Sarah's latest release..too TWANGY/BLUEGRASS/HILLBILLY for my taste. What happened to the folk/rock star that I grew to love? WOW.
5,Is there anything that Sarah Harmer cannot do well?,"How often do you find music that is artistic, well-crafted, and that leaves you feeling good? Normally, when an artist makes a big turn from their previous genre, you get a little wary, but not with Sarah Harmer. On this album you can't help but be impressed by the musicianship of everybody, as well as the compositional skills of Ms. Harmer.This is the kind of bluegrass, country, alt-folk, everything music that everybody can enjoy, even those who don't normally go for this kind of music. It is interesting, often catchy and upbeat, energetic, fun, insightful, and intimate. This album makes you feel like you've known Sarah Harmer for years and are grand old friends.Considering her incredible talent as a singer and songwriter, I don't know how there is anybody left who is not a fan."
4,Great Summer Slumber,"This is a wonderful sleeper, but a bit bulky. I like the sheet that comes with the bag. It's nice that you can through the heavy part of the bag off you and sleep with just the sheet. The padded bag under you keeps you insulated from the cold ground. The hood acts a a pillow cover or light block when the sun comes up but your not ready to rise. The zippers do have some issues, but if your careful they are ok. I own one of these, and had to get a second since my daughter and I have fought who will get to use it. Nice affordable bag. Alan"
2,Not what you expect,"Again, this is another of my least favorite books by Norma Klein. I was expecting a romance, but I found this book mostly dealt with family problems. Although that is just an important subject matter, it wasn't why I was reading the book. If this is going to be your first Norma Klein book, pick another."
4,critic,Seems to be a good dictionary but as usual more for hindi speaker than us european or US people because of the lack of transliteration of the hindi words in romanized characters. But it seems quite complete an well made.
2,Not easy on the eyes. Structure was offputting.,"Not a very effective book for my learning style. I would have requested the Professor use any book but this one. Some concepts were well done, while others didn't seem to be thorough or definite enough. The print changes in places like it was pasted together. If your professor requires this book, be ready for sheer boredom. Too bad, because I hear that there were other more interesting books out there..."
4,Stuck in my head in a good way!,"I read the first two books from this series decades ago. At the time my local library only had those two, and I fell in love with them. I find that every few years the stories and character of Tim Simpson pop into my head and I want to re-read them. No, they are not the greatest mystery novels ever. But they kept me interested, and boring mysteries make me want to skip to the end already! I never once wanted to do that with Tim. I liked his character as much as the mystery. He came across as a very regular guy that always seemed to get more than he bargained for. He wasn't always smart as he needed to be and he knew it, which just added to his charm. Years have gone by since I last read a Tim Simpson Mystery and now with the Internet I can track down the whole series."
1,I didn't like,"It contains a lot of myths related with the religion, mainly. However the stories are too short, only a very small version of the original myth. The main purpose behind a Yoruba myth is not the story itself, but the values and ethic from religion and popular culture. Therefore as are, the stories in this book, you can't understand it. In fact, in my opinion, if you don't see the details and also in some cases stanzas you will have a very bad perception of the Yoruba culture. Then, I think, why this book? May be just a list if some yoruba myths, not all and with no deep content.I apreciate a good job, but I can't say this book is one"
1,Hideous,"The premise was good; I *wanted* to like this book so much I read the entire thing, even as it became clear I was wasting my time. The plot was absolutely predictable (girl is dysfunctional/girl becomes inspired to love herself and sloughs off abusive relationships/girl triumphs and attracts new adoring lover, and finally learns to accept that she deserves happiness) and all the details along the way didn't create a coherent anything. I came away feeling that I was reading the autobiography of someone who hasn't figured out whether her life was chick lit, pomo psychoanalytic drama, or something else altogether. I regret the time spent reading this one."
4,Interesting book,"I have only read the first couple of chapters, and already I love it. The author has an easy-to-read writing style."
5,Light and Fun,"I think many of the low ratings are based on readers taking this book too seriously. The main character did become a bit neurotic and self-absorbed, however, that's what made it so fun. This is easy reading chick-lit. I looked forward to sitting down with this fun book whenever I was able to squeeze in time. Elegance is a delightful read."
4,Easy and fun read,"pick it up if you want something to read on the beach or in the country. Not a brilliant piece of literature, but light entertainment for a weekend.Correction to the editorial review: Genevieve Dariaux is very real and alive and still impecably elegant - at nearly 90 years of age."
2,Glad that I didn't pay for it.,"I was really glad that after reading ""Elegance"" by Kathleen Tessaro that I didn't pay for it. I really had high hopes for this book. It looked like that it was going to be good book, but the truth is that it was not a good book. Louise Canova is a American living in London married to an English actor. At thirty-two she acts like at lease fifteen years older. Until she finds a book called ""Elegance"" by Madame Dariaux in a second hand shop. This small book leads Louise to make some major changes in her life.This is really not that good. The author left major wholes the story that just didn't sense to me. I kept hoping that Ms. Tessaro would fill in the holes, but she didn't.The reason that I gave ""Elegance"" two stars is because of the work of Madame Dariaux,who's book will be selling on Amazon.com in August."
1,Childish and predictable,"Are you kidding me Ms. Tessaro? You actually have your protagonist referring to herself as a ""tard""? And she's HOW old? Thirty-three? Come on! In addition, I've never seen a make-up job which results in the look of Down's Syndrome--what does it look like? These offensive references have no place in a modern day novel. They show a lack of effort, and literary skill on the author's part. Unfortunate too, as the premise for this work seemed original."
5,I loved it!,I couldn't put this book down. It was a really fun read and I loved the characters. I think it is well written and intelligent. This would be great beach reading.This is definitely chick-lit though. I couldn't really see my husband reading it.
2,"A Big Drop, clumsily","If you are like me, a reader who after passing page 50 must continue until the end because every read book is a goal, then let me save you the first 50 pages. This book, very appealing to women due to it's instructive allure, is not really about elegance. Instead, it's about English life, English people, and looking and acting like Margaret Thatcher, something I hope no woman is striving for.Kathleen Tessaro begins her novel with lots of instructions and hope, I even envisioned myself buying an expensive purse. But it all turned flat, sour, and boring, the life of a 32 year old who, ""surprise,"" lands a beautiful younger man, after attending a, check this, weekend getaway with rich, rude, English people. By page 213 I was reading so fast to finish the book that I did 75 minutes non-stop on the stationary bike. Hey, at least I got some lost calories out of it."
4,charming beach novel,"although it feels like another 'single girl making it in London' story at first, the author takes some interesting detours with the wisdom she gleans from an ancient French writer. Its a fun read and perfect for the beach or picnic. I hope this writer continues to give us fun novels like this one."
3,Elegance,"This was a light, fun read. I probably would have given it 4 stars if I hadn't found the protagonist so unlikeable! I was interested to read the book as I actually have the original Elegance book and was curious how it was worked into the novel."
3,It's decent,"I'll not be the first to say that it starts off brilliantly, but goes a bit downhill. There are parts that make me cringe because as much as I hate it, I recognized those feelings and scenarios in my own life. Some parts were pretty unrealistic. La Perla shopping spree, really? I didn't get the impression her job was THAT lucrative, and one little bra is out of the price range for most single working girls. The weekend she spent at her friend's country home made my jaw drop. Someone PLEASE tell me uppercrust Brits are not that rude to their guests! They were horrible, they treated guests like petulant children at a boarding school. Some polite society maven that mother was, what a b*!This book isn't fluffy enough to appeal to some who just want something light and funny, it definitely has a dark side. I'd say it's worth killing time on a rainy afternoon, but that's about it.P.S. I also own the Dariaux book, delightfully campy but also some surprisingly good information."
2,The Cover Speaks Louder Than The Story,"I purchased this book a while back because of its marvelous cover. I had also read the reviews and they were good. Thus, I expected the story to be as good as the cover but, boy, was I in for a let down! This is definitely not a humorous chick lit, like Jemima J., Shopaholic, or Bridget Jones. This story has a good premise but the writing is dull and mostly unhumorous. I can literally count the funny parts on one hand. I cannot give credit for its depth either, since it lacked complexity. The book started to drag around the middle and I started and finished two other books before I finally sucked it up and finished this one."
2,No sympathy for this narrator,"I agree with much of what Abby said, below. This book is very disappointing. If you are expecting a fun, witty Helen Fielding-style book, you're going to be disappointed.Tessaro breaks a most basic rule of writing by telling the reader how the main characters are feeling rather than showing it. It feels forced. But the main problem I have with this book is that the main character, Louise, is very unappealing. She comes across as selfish and shallow and self-obsessed. Tessaro obviously wants us to think ""you go, girl!"" when Louise tells us about flirting openly with her husbands' colleagues; instead, I marvelled at how I was supposed to like a character who did these kinds of pathetic things. Finally, the whole premise of the book is weak - that by wearing tight clothes and putting on makeup, you can transform your life. Louise may become more physically attractive, but that doesn't change the fact that her character, like this book, leaves much to be desired."
2,Amateurish and Meandering,"I really wanted to like this book, but just can't give it the thumbs up. The protagonist is completely unsympathetic... an infantile drama queen whose problems are all self-inflicted. Secondary characters and situations drag on for pages with no payoff or interesting conclusion. The theme is personal growth, yet our leading lady is the same twit on the last page that she is on the first, if somewhat better dressed. Not a good sign when you find yourself doing the mental rewrite as you read it. Pass."
2,Could have been better,I can't help but wonder if the author was on some new medication or was perhaps getting input from conflicting sources.... The book started out as charmingly funny and rather touching but after a few chapters it seems that someone suggested that it take an edgier turn and advised the author to throw in an abortion and perhaps begin using the F word which she did. It picked up a little later and became mildly funny but by then had lost all of it's charm and I felt little or no sympathy whatsoever for the heroine. It's a shame to see such a great idea and a reasonable amount of writing talent go to waste like that.
1,very dissapoint that i read this book,while i was ready to buy this book one of my friends informed me that she already had it and gave it to me. The only precious reading in this book is the first page of each chapter that references to Antoine Darioux.For my opinion is the only information you can take concerning elegnce. The rest material is information that are worthless regarding to elegance and i have surely been beglamoured by the tittle.
2,"""Elegance"" Is Thoughtless About Disabled People","I deeply enjoyed the book ""Elegance"" until I began to notice the many negative references to mentally disabled people. The first chapters offered the character's poor use of make-up until she ""looked like a Down's person."" Then I think a character in a bar acted like a ""special-needs"" person. Then came retarded, tard, person living in a special-needs home, etc. Does this author need to resort to this type of metaphor for her characters? And was the editoral staff so inattentive that no one found this objectionable? After all, imagine if these references had used race as their foundation. By the end of the book I lost all enthusiasm for what had been a fun read. True elegance is using your gifts to show skill and thought, not putting down an entire class of people."
3,Didn't love it...,"I was hoping for something more of an inspirational read. I really liked the premise-that an old book could provide great insight and assistance to a modern day life.Unfortunately, it fell flat. The plot becomes contrived and in the process we lose all sympathy or identity with the main character, Louise.While it may be interesting to witness self-transformation this was empty.Worth a quick read if you can borrow it from the library."
5,Gospel Legends 3 DVD Boxed Set,This product was a great deal for my son. He is 22 yrs of age and he has downs syndrome and he loves gospel music. He can sit hours on end watching the video. The product was exactly as we both had expected. You will enjoy it as well.
5,Roll Your Own,"I eat several ounces of this every day. I mix it with DiVinci Sugar Free Peanut Flavored coffee syrup and a few packets of artificial sweatner as follows: 4 oz Soynut Butter, 1 oz peanut syrup, and 3 packs sweatner. I think that it's great."
5,Excellent quality,This coupling is a must when you need to make repairs and are unable to solder the copper pipe. It's easy and quick to make needed repairs.
5,Great home worship!,"I purchased this to be able to use for our small group. The songs are great - varied and appropriate! I listened to every song before we used it. I couldn't help but worship - a couple of the songs touched me to the point of tears, a couple made me dance! I was excited to find that with a few pushes of my remote buttons, I could make it so that the words were on the screen. This was the perfect purchase for what I was looking for... I plan to purchase all of the series."
3,Ocean and shore and water pictures,the scenes don't match the cover picture which is what I was expecting. No preview allowed me to see contents
3,Poor reprint of an excellent book,"I have inherited copies of the original volume published in 1953. All text and photographs are as in the original volume, but the reprint loses out in photographic reproduction. The original used photographic-grade paper for the pictures and, given the limitations of the era, reproduction is excellent. In the reprint, photographs are printed on the same type of paper used for the text. The details of the photographs are obscured and fuzzy compared to the original, sometimes to the point of being almost indistinguishable. The text is unchanged and will bring a wealth of information to those interested in the naval history of this era. Altogether, considering the price, a disappointing effort. These comments also apply to ""U. S. Submarine Operation in World War II"" by the same author."
4,Destroyer Operations in WW2 - used book,"Getting another copy of this book (and its companion - Submarine operations) was like having an old friend in my hands. I collected pop bottles, cut lawn, etc, as a 12 year old to purchase my first copy. Had the occasion to go on board several of these ship as a young man and would look up the ships history pre-boarding. Amazing to talk to the personnel and give them a run down on what I knew abut the Ship."
4,Returning to Ancient Egypt,"A great adventure story with a twist of fanasty at the end. Written with good research anyone who has been to Luxor will experience again the adventure, mystery and fanasty that you find there. The judgement day picture will now remind me of the The buried pyramid story. Good read."
3,"A Good Start, an Unfortunate Ending","The first 90% of this book is written in the form of a traditional adventure (ala H. Rider Haggard) and is fairly exciting and interesting.Unfortunately, the last 10% is a totally different style. It almost seems as if Ms. Lindskold had written a traditional ending, and was then told that it wasn't exciting enough. So she then pasted on a magical ending whose effect is rather jarring and bizarre.In her attempt to merge history and magic, Ms. Lindskold would have done well to first study the works of Tim Powers, a master of slowing working magic into the story until its presence seems completely natural. Only then does a full-blown magical ending work. To suddenly introduce it forces the reader to shift gears so rapidly that the flow and believability is lost.This is a noble effort that holds some interest for those with a passion for Egyptology, but due to its weak ending, it ultimately fails."
2,Not up to her earlier standard,"The story of a recently orphaned girl - Jenny Benet - who instead of becoming a frontier doctor travels back to UK to be reared by her uncle Neville. Upon arrival she finds that he is about to start out on an archeological expedition to find a hidden pyramid. When uncle neville sets out, Jenny, and her guns, are brought along. The expedition is hampered by threats from a fellow archeologist party and a religious sect bent on protecting the pyramid, and helped by cryptic warnings from an anonymous source. The book start out with a bit of backstory to the search, and end with a suddenly appearing egyptian pantheon.My problems with the story are many. Most prominent is the simplicity and childlike way the story is told - 50 pages in I actually had to make sure it wasn't just a bad childrens book I had picked up - and the sudden tacking on of a 'fantastic' ending that is not in any way made believable or plausible."
1,Snoozefest,"Awful novel, complete waste of time. Takes over 200 pages just to get started, moves along decently for under 100 pages and then goes off the deep end for the last 200 pages in a tedious, annoying meeting of mortals with a number of Egyptian gods and monsters. There is no solid ending with intelligent explanations to make the reading worth it, the story simply stops. That's it.The majority of characters are boring and unlikeable and the author spends endless pages and paragraphs dissecting their thoughts in what seems to be an attempt at teaching morality to the reader, but which only slows the plot, dragging it out endlessly.Trim the book down to 150 pages, add lots of brightly colored graphic novel art and a completely different ending and 'The Buried Pyramid' MIGHT be worth flipping through."
5,How Many Troublesome Days Can One Man Take!,"From Page one to the end of this book the reader will find themselves coming and going, doing and thinking about what the author has written in this story.The good times, the bad times. the depressing mood, the insecurity that he felt while going through all these changes in his life.Having a wife he couldn't trust, forcing him from his teaching position to being a hotel owner hoping to start a new life only to find out that he had taken the problem with him.I found Harry to be a very lonely man who was looking for love in all the wrong palaces because of Anne who became a burden because of the bad habits that she was never able to break.As you read on you are engulfed into his privet world of desolation.This is a good story, well told that keeps your interset as to what will take place next!..I recomand this book for it is a good book to read!.I have never read one like it. It's excelent!"
1,WHAT A GREAT LAUGH!! A JOKE!!,"OKay, so who the heck is rating this movie?? This movie is a complete and utter joke! I watched it and could not stop laughing the ENTIRE time and it is NOT a comedic film.. Though the actors and actresses were attractive.. that was it.. horrible actiong, unrealisitic plot... at first I thought it was a film spoof to something else.. I later realized that they were REAL about this movie..If you want a good laugh.. a must see, otherwise, dont waste your time or money!!"
4,Very Interesting & Intriguing,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie on TMC. Instantaneously, I stopped what I was doing and was glued to the television. It's always nice to watch African Americans on TV. This is the type of movie that keeps you wondering what's going to happen next and you'll want to know who's in on this and who's not. I thought the movie was good. I wouldn't buy it, because some of the acting was a little off base. But I would recommend it to anyone looking for something good to watch on television. There are alot of twists and turns in it. It keeps you amazed at the way things are going. Mekhi does an excellent portrayal of a Smooth Operator. It's like he takes control of Debbie's mind when he talks with her. Especially the scene in the kitchen. WONDERFUL! The ending is sad, but also full of suspense. Buy it or Rent it. The choice is yours."
4,Good Saturday Night Fllick...,"I saw this on a recommendation of a friend, and I went to Blockbusters to check it out. Pretty good storyline (a little over the top), good cast, enough to keep you interested. I did like the ending. This movies is good to watch with your girls on a really boring day, or with your honey. Get this and another ""bad trashy movie"" --Trois 2: Pandoras' Box."
4,Slow starter Good Plot Nice looking actors,Movie starts off slow but it does have a few twists and turns throughout to keep you guessing....worth a watch.
1,Mekhi must have,"REALLY needed the bucks to make this piece of complete trash. I'll review it the way the late Mr. Rogers would have: ""Can you say, STOO-PID?"" Don't waste your time or money. ""Great film?""PUH-LEEZE!"
1,Another White Carrot for Black Males,"This movie was an example of poor acting at it's finest. It is clearly obvious why it was produced in the first place. Black males love movies where black males have sex....either consensual or forcibly.....with white females. This ""In Your Face"" sex farce was intended to stimulate black males......piss off white males........and possibly titilate white females with Socially Taboo sexual content, in which they are condemmed as Racist if they do not openly consider sex with black males as an option. This theme is prevalent in Perverse Hollywood these days....just ask Denzel. If it Shocks or Angers the watcher...they will push it to the limits....in the copious name of Artistic Expression. The rest of us are supposed to clap our hands and pretend to be entertained...when the agenda of this movie....and others just like it....is to Empower black males in a predominately white society. I don't support this garbage......or it's message."
3,twisted,this movie is twisted it has a n ending that will shock you. i thought this movie was okay Mekhi Phifer did a good job on his character. playing the suave but deadly man. and there is only one good looking girl in this movie. Howard's wife. the other girl was okay. she was annoying with all the complaining and moaning. but all in all this movie was okay.
2,I give it a C- Pretty Predictable,I read some of the reviews and decided to take a chance on the movie. I am convinced that some of the actors have taken a moment to rate this movie. It was pretty predictable.
4,It'll Take You By Surprise!,"This movie kept my attention from beginning to end and the entire cast did a very good job. But I was disappointed that there was'nt more of Kim Fields!! I mean, that's why I purchased the DVD!! In any case, if you're a Mekhi Phifer fan, this one is for you."
3,Should of kept it a little more simple at the end..,"Good movie, great acting, and gripping plot. But somewhere at the end the changes become a little overwhelming.Unlike some of the reviewers, I was attached to the movie from the start. The naughty Silk and the wanton girlie/wife was actually just as intense as any other sexy thriller. I followed the characters and the plot right down to the near end. After the first 2 twist things begin to unravel and become unbeleivable. I appreciated the creative effort, but unfortunately the attempts become a little too much to beleive.Good film though and I am recommending it to friends. I'll let them give their own oppinion on the twists and turns."
4,Great Stars and acting in this unheard of movie.,"I first rented this movie because I was bored one night and the wife thought it looked good for the cover. After watching I was wondering why I never heard of it in the movies. I love movies and this one somehow snuck by me. I see so many ""big budget"" movies with very little plot and this movie comes and keeps me glued to my seat. How right the title to say uninvited guest when the main charachter turns out to be a criminal and then the plot twist at the end wrps the movie up quite nicely. Looking for a movie with a ""who one it?"" plot with a twist on the end then look no further. Be aware it starts slow but rolls up quickly into a modern day drama."
4,Thrilling,"One morning I just happened to wake up around 2 AM and had the pleasure of seeing this movie. At the beginning, I figured it would be kind of wack because it just seemed to me as if it were a low budget movie. However, as the movie progessed and the storyline got deeper and deeper, I found myself drawn into it. As sleepy as I was, and knowing I had to get up in a couple of hours for work, I wanted to see how the movie would play out. I must say, I was very well pleased with the plots, storylines, actors, sequences and everything that makes an interesting thrill story (not horror, just thrill). Nonetheless, I stayed up to watch the entire movie. I have been suggesting this movie to anyone who takes time to listen to my story (LOL). If I must say, if you're wanting to focus on an interesting thrill, this is a good movie to check out."
3,"interesting, good plot twisting","I just happened upon this on the movie channel one tuesday night & couldn't turn the channel. very good suspense..(i mean not like SCARY suspense, but suspense in the terms of , one wanted to know what was gonna happen next). Great forethought by the writer. Kudos!!:-)3 stars b/c to me Training Day is a 5 & so is the Thomas Crowne affair, i'd say this is not at that level, but still very entertaining & I'd recommend it to others to check out!"
3,Not awful,"I'd say that this was a so-so film. It kept my interest from beginning to end (not that I had anything better to do), but I thought there were perhaps one too many twists towards the end, and a few plotholes. (Was Tammy in on the plan concerning Silk, or did Howard recruit him on his own?) Rent it or watch it on TV, don't spend a lot of cash."
4,A moment of thrill,"Peter Sis is a fine artist whose distinct style of soft outlines works well for this lush book. It tells the story of a young boy whose favorite thing is dragons. When he learns that there are real dragons on the island of Komodo (which is in fact true - huge monitor lizards inhabit the island) he takes a plane there. Distressed by the many tourists, he takes off on his own for a very private, magical, fleeting moment of discovering a Komodo dragon in the wild. The book has bits of subtle humor in it - for example, the text deadpans that ""it is always easy to find me in a crowd because of my dragon T-shirt"" - while the illustration shows a huge crowd of kids that actually demands a lot of searching to find our hero! Preschool/1st grade nature lovers and explorers will enjoy this gently exciting tale. A brief postscript talks about real Komodo dragons."
5,Excellent - but sad,"Excellent album, lucky enough to find it recently (normally need to order his stuff) really enjoyed it, more what I would expect from him, a reflection on life & love."
2,I'm Alive by Jackson Browne,"I ordered and paid for a new CD and when it arrived, it was a used CD. Delivery was also very slow. I ordered it in early Dec. & it barely arrived for Christmas."
3,"Mediocre for JB, but great for most other musicians","I have to admit, I'm slightly puzzled why so many other AMZN reviewers rate this album so highly. Sure, almost anything Jackson puts out is better than most other musicians' best efforts, but this album is far from his best. Musically, he's missing the haunting melodies of Late for the Sky or the Pretender and lyrically, I can't see any song holding up to The Fuse or even Fountain of Sorrow. Maybe I'm too old, having listened to the other albums during my formative H.S years, when the pain and anguish of the Pretender resonated so strongly. Try one of his first four albums for the best."
3,The Love Isn't There To Stay,"Sometimes, a new song can seem to be very interesting in the eyes. In the case of The Black Eyed Peas, they seemed to make it without a dout, or because of a certain member of Nsync, Justin Timberlake. The vibe on Where Is The Love? is a bit similar as a modern day version of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On? The song seems to speak out very well, as a new act to the mainstream, but it doesn't seem to be all that well. Sometimes I think whether it is from the group, or the actual singer making his guest appearance. Still, I just hope they can try something without Justin, and score hits on there own. Either that, or buy Justin out of Nsync."
3,a shame to hear them crossover like this,I used to like black eyed peas they're one of few rap groups I've felt in a long time that did'nt have to be ganster now they're working with the michael jackson clone of the millenium justinn timberlake.
3,"Anne Previn, Call your lawyer.","""Where is the Love"" is actually a good song, but I keep thinking that I am hearing parts of the melody from the Ednaswap song ""Torn"" (as made popular by Natalie Imbruglia) in the chorus part of the song...Does anyone else hear this..?."
3,The Love Isn't There To Stay,"Sometimes, a new song can seem to be very interesting in the eyes.

Sometimes I think whether it is from the group, or the actual singer making his guest appearance. Still, I just hope they can try something without Justin, and score hits on there own. Either that, or buy Justin out of Nsync."
3,Where is the single?,"I'm not even a fan of the general rap genre, but the song ""Where is the Love?"" really caught me & held me from the opening to the end. I love it. I don't care for the rest of the cd."
2,pretty Average,one of those Songs that sneaks into a Big Hit without anyone paying much attention.this Song reminds me of a Song Coolio had out a few years ago.Justin Timberlake still trying hard hard at dropping a Michael Jackson like Vocal part.one of those songs that just kinda stayed around.
