1,Not even close,"I gave up after 11%. Juvenile writing, cardboard characters, pointless setting description, absurd dialog and more - an amateurish attempt as science fiction."
1,Egypt redux,"Sorry to say I couldn't finish this one - the writing was decent, not great. But when you give your characters generic names like the Engineer and the Mechanic you can figure they're probably need more fleshing out.- the plot was interesting, but not interesting enough. I reached a point when the bad guy did something predictably bad and had to quit. Nice concepts, but the execution needs to be better."
5,What a great surprise!,I purchased this book on Kindle because the combination of science fiction and ancient/modern day Egypt was just too great to resist. I was not disappointed in the least. The story taking place in two timelines was intriguing and I especially enjoyed the parts that took place in ancient Egypt. I will be watching closely for this authors next book!
2,"A highly unlikely story, rather strange and implausible.","This story is surely inspired by Daeniken, it is highly implausible and makes no sense. Apart from this the book is heavy (think paper) and bulky, not the sort of stuff to read on the beach on on long-haul flights."
4,Science fiction escapism,Interesting characters and plot. Fast paced and easy to read quickly. Who can avoid enjoying a quest to save your civilization from an alien species? Mix in ancient Egypt and a little romance and you have a fun story.
5,What a story!,"A gripping story from beginning to end. I enjoyed watching each part of this story unfold and come together in the end, awesome book!"
4,Photogenic,"Early on I thought I had stumbled upon a young adult work by mistake but the story and its complexity quickly escalated to a satisfying level. With a large cast the author employed a clever device-- identifying certain of the many key characters according to their occupation (for example, ""The Archeologist"") instead of numerous and confusing alien names.This is a surprisingly good book from someone who appears to be a first-time author. Also if you check out her photo you'll see she's HOT."
3,Fun...but certainly not a giant in literature,"This is an entertaining light read for people like me who are in between the search for something a little more challenging. Certainly this author can write better than I ever could. Maybe, with more time, she can produce a novel up to the level of say, a Heinlein, or a Simmons. At least this is a fun effort, and perhaps an indicator that she could be better. That being said, I would give a new novel by her another shot. I think she should keep working at it, and perhaps someday she will turn out a truly great work."
5,"Excellent Writing, Great Book, I want MORE from this author","Really a fine creative writing effort and a fun premise on which to base the storyline. I thouroghly enjoyed the author's use of an ancient civilization as the foil for her present day story but I wish she could have somehow expanded this book into a larger version. In other words, I want more of the same from a really enjoyable and creative writer."
4,Entertaining read !,"I picked this up on a whim thinking that the plot sounded interesting. The book caught and help my attention throughout although the start was a little slow. All the time I was reading the book, I was thinking to myself that this would make a great movie. Very happy with the purchase from an author that I knew nothing about."
2,Slow pace detracts from promising plot,"Well established characters but for so so long nothing much happens, scene setting galore with minimal action. And the book is self-spoiling--you already know the outcomes for lots of the characters, because the author tells you, then its just a long drawn out saga of how it happened. I tried and failed to get all the way to the end. A pity really, because the universe described is interesting, the characters show promise, plenty of potential for drama, but those nuggets of action are just too hard to find."
3,I'd really like to give it 2.5 stars,"An interesting story; could've definitely used an editor. Length OK, but descriptions need work: frequent unfortunate repetition of adjectives in adjoining sentences or paragraphs. Plotting was interesting and took some unpredictable twists, if overall a bit prosaic. The 'let's all love each other' ending was cliched and I could've done without it.The situations on the two alien worlds were unique and it would've been ink better spilt with more description, backstory, and events occurring there. These free rentals on KOLL are mostly not worth my time; it was nice to find one I was interested to finish. Overall a good effort needs professional sprucing up to be something worth buying at regular novel prices. For a rental or a $2 or $3 purchase it's OK."
4,Fun book that draws you into the story,"I cannot say that this book has great literary merit, but it drew me in so I could hardly put it down. The author did a good job with her characters, so I cared about them. I enjoyed the ancient astronaut premise. I was reminded of Battlestar Gallactica, which I enjoyed immensely. This novel would make a good movie or mini-series. I can recommend this book, especially to people who like to make an occasional foray into science fiction like myself."
5,Best sci if I read in a long time!,Excellent read. Great story line. Recommend it to any Sci fi fan. This takes you on journey into mankind's unanswered questions through a fictional scenario. The characters are realistic and you are pulled by there conflict.
4,Pretty good,"Overall liked the concept of the story. Was able to get to know the characters and it had a good plot. I felt left wanting more from it though. Some pieces seemed to fit together a little too easily. I enjoyed it, but there could have been a little more substance and deeper plot."
3,Very Good SCFI Novel,"This is good scfi, tying together ancient Egypt and ancient space travelers from another universe...with present day Earth. Book is well written and well edited and characters are developed pretty good.In the first part of the book, a lot of characters are introduced and it's a little hard to keep them all straight, as the story jumps back and forth between time periods. Once the characters become familiar though, the story is easy to follow.There is a chance meeting of two critical characters (one from each time period) at an airport in Egypt....that I found a little too coincidental. But, other than that, it's a great story and I'd recommend it.3 stars"
4,rise,"As the title implies, this story is about rising to a challenge. It is a story to bring home to your personal challenge. Make that choice but first, read this book!"
4,Great read,"Excellent story line and interesting blend of past and present. Reads like a five-star, but too conveniently relies on the premise that the Kinley are human. Once you get past that premise and the myriad questions it would raise, it reads very well. Personally, I would have preferred a human-like race that wasn't perfectly interchangeable but for skin tone and technological advancement. Also, a bit sparse on details in ancient Egypt, but I'm not really complaining."
5,"BREEZIN--more than a gentle ""breeze!""","I first heard the title song of this CD on an AM radio station. AMAZON had the CD, and I purchased it. Not only was I pleased to hear ""Breezin,"" but all of the other songs on the CD as well. If you like gentle-easy listening, then this CD is for you!"
5,Breezin' Is Pleezin',I have been listening to Breezin' since it was first released on vinyl. There is no higher smooth jazz experience available at any price. Mr. Benson is on the smooth jazz pedistal of my musical life.
4,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful pop/soul album with a light jazz influence. I put it this way because it's not a true jazz album. George Benson proves he is a master at vocal interpretation. The title cut ""Breezin'"" is the album's strongest track. ""This Masquerade"" is also a classic. Although I do prefer the Carpenters' recording of ""This Masquerade"" far more (you just can't beat Karen's deep rich voice)."
5,A true classic. Benson's best album thus far.,"This is George Benson's crowning achievement of his Jazz Career. It received the 1976 Grammy which it richly deserved. His Guitar playing on this is flawless and the only song that he sing's on this album is ""This Masquerade"" is outstanding. You can hear the emotion of not only his singing but the way he plays the guitar on this album. From ""This Masquerade"" to ""Six to Four"", ""So this is Love"" ""Lady"" and the other songs on here are a delight to listen to whether you are with the one you love, or traveling down the highway, this is the one album that all Jazz or Easy Listening fans should have. It is simply outstanding and stood the test of time in the best of ways..A pure delight to listen to!"
4,THE BREEZIN GENERATION,"I remember my days in the military 75 - 78, when I heard my first Jazz Album by Chuck Mangione, ""FEELS SO GOOD"" (76). That song got me started listening to jazz music. Then I started listening to George Benson during his CTI years. Then came ""Breezin"". That was all it took for me to start really listening to Benson. But I must say it was Wes Montgomery that inspired me to start palying the guitar seriously. I guess I can honestly say that JIMI HENDRIX, WES MONTGOMERY and GEORGE BENSON were the guitarist that gave me the appetite to play the guitar. I first heard the The Breezin album on vinyl and now that I have the CD I'm even more happier now. Who knows maybe I just might replace all my vinyl records with CD's."
5,This NEVER gets old!,"I've been listening to this album ever since I picked up the original LP. I could hear these songs over and over again, and they'd still be as fresh and clean as the first time I heard them! A definate must have for any CD collection!"
4,pristine production...but somethin' lacking....,"Maybe it's the sound on CD.But it's a great recording...especially all of side two, which I wore out on LP, twice, in 4 years of college.Also dig his solo on the ""Miles In The Sky"" CD by Miles Davis...first tune.""Six to Four"" still hurts to hear, but the rest is a delight. Buy it."
3,Not as bad as I was expecting,"Ok...to start with - I cannot stand Paris Hilton. I still have not figured out what business this woman has still getting headlines - Isn't her 15 minutes up yet? Anyway, I watched this film and was actually humored and entertained. Paris played the part very well and convincing and the story line was cute. Not an award winner but also not a waste of time."
5,"Either your ""hot"" or ""not""","I thought this movie was very sweet. I hadn't seen a movie like it before, it was refreshing to watch an unfamiliar plot unfold. I loved the fact that June was given a chance to shine. It would be so hard to be constantly compared to your friend as the ""nottie"". I think something we can learn from this movie is that you should make the most of who you are, don't put yourself down. If you don't believe in yourself, who will? I know a lot of people hated this movie because of Paris Hilton. If you focus on the story, its far better than most movies today. I'd definitely recommend it, especially to teenage girls. Go on, its worth it."
1,"Actors, Writer, Director & Financiers Deserve A Place In Hell","What a great way to get rid of an un-wanted house guest. Keep a copy of this film close at hand, and when you have had just about all you can take, put this film into your dvd player and hit the play button.If they haven't high-tailed it out your door within 15 minutes, pray for a visit from Freddy."
5,I'm Nobody's Hero,This is my favourite Bride album. They layed off the heaviness somewhat to deliver their roots. A classic rock/metal/blues hybrid! This songs will get you tapping your feet and singing along immediatley.
3,A good reference guide and introduction,"The book by Miller comprises a collection of Goethe's scientific writings over his entire life selecting the major works and leaving more detailed renderings to other texts such as Berta Mueller's ""Goethe's Botanical Writings"", or Amrine's ""Goethe in the History of Science"". The book ranges over physics, botanical investigations, animal structure, human intermaxiallary bone, meteorology, geology and also some essays on the process of scientific investigation itself.Goethe's writings are subtle, especially his essays and I feel that the translation may have been better from the original German which I mean to obtain (being able to read German has its advantages). Of course this judgement could well be premature since I have not read the original as yet. This does not take away from the book which is a good reference text for a broad outline.Well worth getting when looking at Goethe's works and approach to science."
4,molly's been reserected from the pile of rubbish,finally an album that I don't have to skip tracks on or try to pawn off in some cheap store.Thank GOD for a album which is consistant through out.Their best since Flirtin With Disaster.GOOD WORK GUYS
5,"Awesome, blistering Southern rock!!","Molly Hatchet's new album, ""Warriors of the Rainbow Bridge"" is a wonderful array of crunching guitars, Southern boogie and rock, and footstomping riffs that will have you listening over and over. Beginning with the highly acclaimed ""Son of the South"", this record tears the roof off of the Conferderacy with blistering playing and soulful singing. Personal highlights include the title track, ""Rainbow Bridge"" that borrows elements from ""Fall of the Peacemakers"", and ""Roadhouse Boogie"" that contains some of most heartfelt lyrics about a musician's life on the road that I have ever heard. There is not a weak track on this album and with Molly Hatchet touring everywhere between now and November, it is high time for all those interested to secure this record, play it over and over, then go see the band live in all of their Southern rock and roll glory. ""Warriors of the Rainbow Bridge"" is, in my opinion, an outstanding album from an outstanding band."
3,NOT QUITE THERE,"AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THIS A HIGH RATING,I CAN`T.THIS CD IS JUST NOT AS GOOD AS THE LAST 3 CD`S THAT THE CURRENT BAND HAS PUT OUT.I CAN`T QUITE PUT MY FINGER ON IT BUT NOTHING SEEMS TO BE QUITE AS GOOD.THE SOLO`S SEEM FORCED AND THEY JUST DON`T FLOW.I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR SUPPORTERS OF THIS NEW BAND BUT I`M WONDERING IF THIS BAND HAS HAD JUST TO MUCH TRAGISTY IN ITS LIFE TO MAKE IT WORK ANY MORE.THE VOCALS ARE SOLID BUT I GUESS WHAT I`M SAYING IS MOST OF THE SONGS ARE JUST NOT VERY GOOD.SORRY HATCHET,BUT I HOPE THE NEXT CD IS BETTER."
3,Not the best. Not the worst.,"To all you people living in the past, get a life. The band has grown beyond the point of trying to make every album sound like a Flirtin' With Disaster, you should too. I'm very glad of that as Flirtin' isn't and wasn't the ""best"" Hatchet cd ever anyway. Sure, that song got tons of air play, but are you people to illiterate to like a song that ISN'T played on the radio until it's worn out? Warriors of the Rainbow Bridge isn't the ""best"" Hatchet ever either, but IS a WHOLE lot better than any other southern rock coming out lately or especially any of the new music altogether. Good to see Dave Hlubek back in the band. Hope he stays, but I have my doubts on that. Warriors is slightly more of a hard rock album than strictly a southern rock one, but who cares about the genre? If it's good, get it and crank it and this is a good one!! GET IT NOW!!"
2,Not very fun to read,"I bought this book thinking I would get a little insight into what was actually down in those bases...but all this book is, is a bunch of documents proving that these tunnels and underground bases exist. Which, with time and effort...anyone can find. But it IS worth just looking through...and it IS worth having just as reference, or when you want to say to someone ""look, see what some of your money is paying for!"". But that's about it. There is no new insights or revelations that make you think or ponder what is happening....just a bunch of financial numbers.So, not much fun to read...but good for reference."
1,How to Build a Big Tunnel,"Richard Sauder has done his homework. He has documented the means and methods by which the American Government and some of the more powerful corporations have been building many tunnels and bases under U.S. soil and oceans. If you want to know the how, then this book is for you.If you want to know why these tunnels were built and their possible functions, then steer well clear. I bought this book on the assumption that I would be finding out about conspiracies, about things I haven't been told elsewhere.Instead I get facts and figures about tunnelling machines and costs and corporations. This is the sort of dry factual material I was force fed at University. No more!"
2,Wasn't what I expected.,"Reference book information. Everything in this book can be found on the Internet or in common reference books. If you want to really know secrets from 'insiders' and world recognized researchers, then read: 'Unconventional Flying Objects' by Dr. Paul Hill (NASA scientists), 'Alien Agenda' by Jim Marrs, the best selling author of several books including 'Crossfire.' Read 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger and Edgar Fouche. Steiger has written and published over a hundred books and novels, many in this conspiracy/paranormal/UFO genre. Fouche worked Top Secret black programs for over 25 years and reveals way too much in Alien Rapture. Check out these other fine books on Amazon. I would pass on this one. Besides, Art Bell and Whitley Strieber this guy has no real support and is boring, boring, boring."
5,NOW THIS IS TALENT,"this is a great album! and the ""i want you back"" songs are great! these five talented guys have the music, the style, and the moves to be #1!!! Nice going 'n sync!"
3,COOL,I think N'Sync has GREAT song's and GREAT Voices. My fave (I can't remember the Title)But Justen and J.C. sung most of it.
1,Dont Buy the Exilim EX-Z75,"I recently purchase this camera and had to returned it, the battery would not charge up. I got a replacement and again it would not charge... I called Casio to find out that they had problems with the batteries, and they offer to send me a battery at not cost to me ASAP... I opted to return the camera and I am going with a Sony or Canon."
1,do not buy this camera,I bought the camera last june. It worked fairly well but then one day while holding it in my hand the display screen went blank. Apparently a crack developed in the LCD screen - the camera was not dropped or subjected to any trauma.Casio refuses to repair under warranty because they claim I caused the damage.Customer service has been TERRIBLE.I would not buy another Casio product
2,Not worth the upgrade,"Typically, I come here to read the reviews, before purchasing the item I'm looking for. I hope this will alert you to the Casio Exilim EX-Z75. The quality of this camera was below average standards. I've been using Casio Exilims for years, and this version is not as good as the 5MP camera I currently own, so I returned it."
1,"Too Fragile, poor design","Received this camera as a Christmas gift last year -- it didn't make it to this Christmas. Warranty is 1 year from date of purchase.The camera is very easy to use and takes good pictures. We were particularly happy with its ability to stop motion.The battery clip failed within the first week but the battery door keeps it in so no serious problem.The battery failed in the second week but Casio sent a new one out in a jiffy.The camera has had a lot of use but nothing out of the ordinary. It worked great for 50 weeks then it started reporting a ""lens error"". Looking on the Internet verifies this is a typical problem with this camera. Casio wants $120 to repair it -- ha! The lens was not abused, and nothing happened that we can determine should have caused it to quit. We took some pictures -- downloaded them and turned the camera off. The next day it would not work."
4,LOVE THIS CAMERA!,I just got this camera a few days ago and I love it!It:- takes great pictures- it very easy to use- super sleek and stylishBUY IT!
4,Good Compact camera ( update-Lens errors),"(update) I have had the lens break on me twice now. I am worried it will break again after the 1 year warranty is up. bought in January 2008, broke in March and again in October. Recommend looking some where else for a better camera, Have had good luck with Cannon.recommend not creating a review until after 6 months. I would now only give this 2 stars but I can't seem to be able to edit my previous rating.This camera works very well. I do see were the picture quality could be better but it does pretty good. The layout and functionality are great and it is very small. I got this for my 13 year old daughter and she was able to understand how to work it with out much help from me. I did not get this based on the best quality of picture, which it does OK. but for the size and convenience of the use. If you want a nice little point and shoot this is a pretty good choice."
2,"Small and practical, buttons can be improved","This is a nice camera, small and practical, Casio can improve on the ease of use of buttone, takes a bit of trying to turn it on due to the small power button, also the navigation can be improved, the delete pic and cancel too close, be careful with that, overall it is a nice camera, that will work if you are looking for something quick and small"
3,good for price,"I had a Exilim before but lost the camera, so I got this one. It has this whole screen for different shots, call Best Shot, but they are not really that useful. For example there is not a choice for shooting in a theater setting or nightclub. The anti-shake is ok but not that big a deal. I kinda wish I bought the one that is You Tube friendly.I don't find the zoom to work that well. the focus is blurry.The size is great and the battery holds up during a long night of shooting. The price is reasonable.The blue is soothing!"
2,The only thing great about this camera is the size,"I have had this camera for about 7 months. Right from the start it took mediocre pictures (semi blurry), but I forgave it for that because I wanted something small and cool looking. After seeing some comparable cameras though that my friends have I now know that the images mine took were really unacceptable. To add insult to injury something internal to the camera came loose recently and I had to send it in to Casio. No problem I thought, I have had it less than a year and that's the warranty period. Guess what, they want $150 to fix it! Ridiculous. You can get a better camera with higher MP for that price. I see a lot of folks were happy with this camera, and that's great, but beware the horrible warranty dept should you need a repair. Bunch of thieves."
5,EXCELLENT CAMERA !! GREAT BUY,"i bought this camera as a gift for my friend. have to say he is extremely pleased with the performance of the camera so far. the image quality is pretty good compared to many other 8MP cameras . the only thing is a bit disappointing is the image clarity of the LCD panel. its a bit blurry and grainy. otherwise the camera has a very sleek model body, light weight and is well priced !"
2,Exilim Let down,"This was my 3rd Exilim and I have returned it via the AMEX ""Return Assurance Plan"" after 60 days. Transfer speeds are very slow even onto my new Mac Book Pro, battery life is very short compared to previous Exilims (I recharge about every 75-125 shots compared with 1000's of shots with previous models). The viewing screen is just not clear...it has a haze which makes it look like the shot is over exposed. The transferred pics are fine and the camera is what it is billed to be...but for the AMEX benefit, I would keep it. I am going to go to the new Sony 8MP camera with internal zoom....sexy!"
1,Poor Casio Support,"I always expect there to be good and bad in reviews, but we have a Casio EXZ60 that is in for repairs, for the second time, and now Casio is offering an upgrade to the EX-Z75 for almost the same price as I paid for the first one. No more Casios for me. Oh, did I mention that the EXZ60 wasn't even a year old. My purpose of checking out these reviews was to see if it would be smart to upgrade, NO THANKS."
5,Excellent camera!,"For a camera of its size, this camera received excellent reviews--I have not been disappointed. I am especially impressed at how quickly it captures a photo."
4,"Great camera, great customer service from Casio","The camera is easy to use (very intuitive), has excellent battery life, and fits in my pocket, bag, etc. I went on a three week trip to France, took hundreds of pictures and only had to recharge when I got home. The battery died about a year in but a quick call to casio customer service (I waited maybe 3 minutes for a rep), told them about the battery problem and they just sent one to me. It was there in less than 3 days!! Great all around but really pleased with the customer service."
4,Great with one small fault,"Fantastic camera, anybody can figure out the menu after a couple times. Great pictures, I especially like the Ebay feature that compresses the final shot and makes it easy to upload to Ebay.One minor fault -- the camera is too slick to hold properly. You had better use the strap or you'll end up dropping it!"
2,Pictures are blurry,"I bought this because I wanted a ""slim"" camera to replace my old Kodak CX7530 which is pretty bulky. I did a buch of research and a couple of ""pro"" sites said the pics were blurry, it seemed from all the user reviews that the pro sites were just being picky. Well I guess I am picky too because the pictures are no where as clear and crisp as my old camera which is only a 5 MP camera. The pictures are blurry, plain and simple and maybe for most it's not enough to make a differance for me it is. I will say this though, I don't know how anyone couldn't tell the difference though, cause it's pretty obvious. I bought this on black friday and it's going back after a weekend of use and a bunch of pictures that I am not happy with."
4,Great little camera with lots of neat features!,"This is a great little camera with lots of neat features! I particularly like the grid to help keep pics straight and well composed. (This feature is very similar to the one on my Nikon D80.) I really like the large LCD and the small size of this camera!However, the software that comes with the camera is just not very good--I use Nikon's Picture Project instead and it works fine with the Casio Exilim."
2,"Horrible Support, Blurry Photos","I owned this camera a total of one day and took it back. The Exilim has a great user interface and is a great size, but their prone to product failures. It's a good looking, compact camera, but that's about it. Close-up test photos of stationary objects were extremely blurry (not talking macro close either). What happened to image stabilization? All links on the Casio site for manuals and quickstart guides for this model were broken. I opted for a nice Sony Cybershot instead. It was a little more expensive, but I'm very happy with it."
2,casio exilim ex-z75 7.2 mp digital camera,"from order to shipping is quite efficient, but the quality is pretty bad, it lost its focus function after third day we used this camera."
3,Camera seems good but instructions less so,The camera seems to work fine but the printed information seems a throwback to the days when asian manufacturers did not have a good command of the english language. In reading the printed inserts and in reviewing the information on the cd the language is very disjointed and unclear. It makes it difficult to understand all the capabilities of the camera.
3,Casio Exilim,"I like the camera, I was told that the usb port was the one for this camera and that is not true. The camera did not come with a usb port that fits. It is an inconvenience."
1,Waste of money,"After 5 months of use, pictures started appearing with broken lines in the middle, some kind of strange dotted line, so I stopped using it. Only video works but quality of audio is poor and also grainy in low light. I will not buy Casio anymore. Buy Canon instead if you want quality picture and amazing video with powerful sound."
3,sleek looking but grainy picture,Let me begin by saying that while I was shopping for a camera this was the one that looked sleek and sylish with an attractive price. The main disappointment is the picture is grainy mostly taking inside pictures. I find myself wanting to take outside pictures because they do come out sharp but if you are looking to take natural looking pictures without the flash-they will come out grainy. Even when you choose the option to shoot without flash in natural light-it still doesn't work. When I do use the flash indoors it seems to be too strong--I have also played with the the flash power with no avail. The lithium battery is a big plus - long life and charges quickly- I do wish the battery entry would be elsewhere since it opens easily sometimes when taking pictures-Overall I think it's a good camera with great price
2,Disappointing,"The optics on this camera leave a lot to be desired. Images are not crisp, rather they tend to look soft and a bit out of focus. With 7 megapixels you would expect very good detail but I got better, clearer pictures from my old Canon 4 megapixel camera. This camera is ok if you don't care too much about the details, but if you're taking pictures that you really care about, go with something else."
4,Casio EX-Z75.7MP Digital Camera,"The camera is small as promised with most of the features contained in larger, more expensive digital cameras. This camera has a very long battery life between charges, a major advantage over other digital cameras I have purchased. The only drawback is the lack of a hardcopy instruction book, which makes it impossible to look up technical/infrequently used instructions or to troubleshoot when there is no readily available computer. The provided compact disc does include detailed instructions covering the complete range of capabilities of the EX-Z75.2MP camera."
4,Great for it's size,I got this camera to take to Europe on vacation. It took great pictures for the most part (just a couple blurry one's when the light was low). The only thing I wish it had come with was a case - I got a scratch on the lovely blue exterior the first day.
2,Poor Photo Quality,"I bought this camera several years ago, and have yet to take a fantastic photo. At one time, this was my primary camera, but now only use this as a back-up. I cannot get decent images in anything but full light. Even then, images are still grainy. In every other way, it is great. Easy to use, good battery life, lots of features, portable, etc. But isn't the point of a camera to take good pictures?"
2,OK for a camera that's behin the times,"This camera was a present given to my husband a couple of years ago. I have had several digital cameras. This one doesn't rate high in my opinion. I prefer to select my own photographic equipment. Your lighting situation has to be near perfect to get a decent image. The camera is not easy to use even with the manual. When this camera was left behind in our vacation home, my research showed that a Panasonic Lumix TS1 was the best replacement. That camera is waterproof to 10 feet, shock proof, and takes great videos. I intend to upgrade to the TS2 soon while they're still in stock. Why anyone would buy this Casio over a Canon Powershot is surprising."
4,good,"I bought this camera as I was leaving South Korea. Love it!!! I'm suprised the price is still pretty high now in 2010, because I purchased it back in 2007 at the same price (*249.00). Anyways, great construction, portability, my only grip, is that it takes better VIDEO, than pictures!!...The videos on here are amazing for a 7.2 mp cam. but i expected the pictures to be a little clearer. Especially if you have even the slightest of shakey hands, whether it be from old age or alcohol!!!...I actually use this camera for all my video purposes now and rarely take pictures."
1,Breaks too easily!!!,This camera takes good pictures but it has some bad drawbacks!!! The battery is horrible to begin with and the camera is very sensitive. I accidentally put the camera on the table on its front side and it opened and the lense broke. I had to send it to casio they are the only ones that will fix the camera. It cost just as much to fix the thing as it is to buy a new one! I got an upgrade and the same thing happened to camera number two! DO NOT buy this camera unless you want to spend lots of money on postage and repairs.
1,unreliable,"This camera has a 6 month warranty. That should have been a warning to me. After 8 months the lens motor quit working and I got an estimate from Casio saying it would be $134.95 to fix it. Needless to say, I will never buy another Casio product as long as I live."
1,Not what I expected!,This camera was in such bad shape. There where old photos on it and it was surpose to be in good condition and it was in very poor conditions. My daughter hasn't been able to use it at all.I am pretty sure I will order anything again!
2,"Flat, washed-out colors in pictures. Not a pretty sight.","Wow, I'm not sure what's with all the glowing reviews. I bought this EX-Z75 because my Canon camera is a few years old and I wanted something with higher resolution. So I got this Casio one and wow, the colors are bad. Everything looks so flat and washed out and dead. My old Canon is so much more vibrant. The shirt I was wearing in the pictures on the Casio didn't look like the color it does with the naked eyed, it looked faded in the pictures. I tried messing around with the settings of brightness and saturation and the modes but... it didn't seem to fix the problem. Anyway, a good camera should take good pictures right out the box. Sure, this has a big LCD and the camera is slim but if it can't take decent pictures, I have no use for it. I am not happy with this Casio and it's being returned tomorrow. Buh-bye."
5,Extremely pleased!,"This camera was second choice to the Canon powershot. I did my research online and found a lot of pleased consumers, so I decided to buy it. I have yet to regret my decision. The pictures come out very clear, crisp colors. Very easy to use, menus are straight forward, battery life is AWESOME!! I bought the camera a month ago, have used it several times and have yet the need to charge the battery. This camera is definitely worth the money."
4,Does what it is suppose to.... Nothing less and nothing more,"Well, if anyone is expecting to do photo shoots with this camera, save your money.. It is not meant for that. It is a slim camera, portable in your pocket, whenever you need one, kind of Camera. And taking pictures is as simple as it gets. It does a great job of pictures outside. In the house, or dark areas, well they are a little grainy, but you can use high ISO with a 'Soft Flash' and that makes the pictures very useful......So in conclusion... get this camera for portability and you will love the shots, but don't expect to make posters out of your pictures.. but Casio never said that you could!!p.s. I am a Fashion Photographer. so I do have DSLR as well. but love this camera for what is is made for."
3,Finish and case material though OK could be better.,"This watch is solid. It is made of steel and well finished. Time will tell if the crystal holds up on a ring of keys, however it appears solid too. The watch is on the heavy side which I like. UPDATE - the finish comes off when dropped and the case pits.UPDATE : The light broke and the finish is wearing off. The quality of this piece is average. Smith and Wesson does not mean quality with this timepiece."
2,Just a watch,"Nothing special here, was disappointed the hands did and numbers did not glow in the dark. I needed this watch for night work.. Will keep and eye out for luminated hands and numbers..."
2,light problem and ease of view,"This pocket watch is hard to read the time without full light conditions, and the face is not as presented in the photo. Perhaps the built in light would help, but it worked only once when first used and has not functioned since."
1,belt loop watch,"I bought two of these watches over the past six months and I had problems with both. The first one the clock was intermittent. I bought a second one. This one the light came on and would not turn off. I opened the back and had to disconnect the wire to the light, when I started putting it back together the back would not seat. Upon trying to reseat the back I broke the crystal. I then took the mechanism out of the second watch and put it in the first watch casing. The light is still intermittent. I would NOT purchase another one of these."
5,Fantastic new argument on Human Sacrifice,"I first read this book years ago in college and loved it. I would say I read this book at least once a year. His theories regarding human sacrifice, scapegoating, and our evolving interpretation of death are incredibly interesting and have helped me narrow down the topic I intend to study for my anthropological post-graduate program. This is well-written, well-researched, and is an excellent introduction to the subject for the general reader. I highly recommend this book."
1,Couldn't Make it Through the Book....,"Wow. What can I say but that reading all of the dialog between the two main detectives wore me OUT. I tried really hard like it, but abandoned it less than half-way through, because there was more mundane dialog than there was action or story."
2,Pinnacle Must Have Been Desperate for a Release When They Published This Book,"Has author Samuel Roen ever listened to anyone converse? Apparently not, because his dialogue as related in Evidence of Murder was horrible; who talks like the individuals in this book? No one that I know, and especially not detectives.But...if you can get through the cheesy dialogue, there is an interesting story here. Roen relates the story of Carla Larson who fell pray to a random act of violence leading to her death by John Huggins, a career thief and wife beater turned murderer. Most interesting is that her husband, Jim Larson, lost his sister to serial killer Danny Rollings just a short time before his wife's demise. Who thinks that random killing can strike one family twice?!Evidence of Murder by Samuel Roen is difficult to read. The story of Carla Larson would have been best suited written by someone with experience in the true crime genre. I DO NOT recommend this book, even for rainy day reading."
2,Not like the actual movie's soundtrack...,"When I first saw the movie I was psyched to get the soundtrack; I mean, so many great songs... Magic Carpet Ride, Time for All Seasons, Let's Get It On... Unfortunately none of them turned out to be on this CD. There are a few good songs, but it's really not the same feel as you get from the music when actually watching the film. It seems that Vol 2 of this CD would be pretty good from the track listings, but I don't actually have a copy. My advice: if you are going to buy one CD this year: make it vol 2. But if you are going to buy two, vol 1 is decent too."
2,Soundtrack of some of the film,Many ofthe songs from the film do not appear on the soundtrack leaving it void of some of the rocking tunes that featured. The absence of these songs is noticable on the CD as it leaves it with less memorable songs.
3,It failed to stand up to my expectations.,"After watching the original Austin Powers I could hardly wait to see the second one, let alone hear the great soundtrack, with songs so highly praised as Dr. Evil's rendition of ""Just the Two of Us,"" and Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger."" I bought the CD and was sadly disappointed by the remake of ""American Woman"" and all the other pathetic songs. It was highly over rated even though I thouroghly enjoyed some of the songs."
3,"Just bought it because of ""Beautiful Stranger""","I confess, I bought this because of ""Beautiful Stranger"". I have listened to a little bit of this CD(like the ""Word Up"" remix)but don't really want to listen to the whole thing just yet. I haven't found the right time to listen to it, like when I'm on the computer when I have the time to listen to the CD from beginning to end. And I also have to confess that I have seen ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" yet."
4,"As Dr Evil would say ""Quite pleasent really""",I thought that it was very shagadelic. Not as good as the first one but never the less its worth the money for sure.
2,i'm sick of rewinding the tape after the madonna song is ove,"okay, i couldn't buy the madonna single because it hasn't come out yet so i shelled out the 12 bucks to get this whole cd. Beautiful stranger is a strangely beautiful song, but it's unfortunate for the other artists that this song is included because it makes their musical attempts seem even more depressing. and Mel G is buggin hard."
3,Madonna outshines the others,"Madonna's opening track of this CD sets a wonderfully groovy tone that somehow isn't maintained throughout--that number by the former Spice Girl was an unfortunate inclusion. And why the omission of ""Magic Carpet Ride,"" which was perfect in the movie as music for Austin's time travel scene?"
2,BAD BAD BAD!,"What a god-awful soundtrack! Folks who loved the International Man of Mystery CD will especially be dissapointed. Would it really have killed them to do the real songs instead of half-baked remakes by REM, Lenny Kravitz and others? Such songs as Draggin the Line and Time of the Season have never sounded worse--Time of the Season sounds like a machine. Even Soul Bossa Nova, Austin's theme, gets spectacularly garbled. Save yourself the dough and buy the single of Beautiful Stranger, the one good song."
4,Clara schumann,"Thanks to the pianist we have all the piano works of Clara Schumann. It is a rare treasure to have such recordings. Every music major should have a copy of these cd's. Clara Schumann as a composer is amazing! Clara Schumann's technical and musical command will raise applause indeed! Of course we credit the pianist for accomplishing such a huge recording endeavor. In general, the pieces are very well played with a marvelous technique and good sensitivity. But I don't personally agree with all the interpretations such as the Mazurka in g minor. I felt that was too slow and schmaltzy. But wow oh wow for the Impromptu Le Sabbat!! What amazing technique of Jozef de Beenhouwer and an awesome creation of Clara."
3,photo shoot in a million,"If you know Jason king then you will know this is not a grow book,but what it is ,is a photo-shoot with buds been the model (very nice too) Great shots ,marvell as he( J,King) tries to get you to almost taste the subjects as he describes them for you, add too that a couple of interesting paragraphs and you have quite a neat book."
4,excellent,"I love how other people act like they know what they are talking about, these reviewers are idiots. This book is great enough said."
5,it's best nursery rhymes CD,I listened to a lot of nursery rhymes CDs. This is best. There're 3 more Nursery Rhymes books with Cds sang by same singers Elizabeth harris& Chris Steinmetz. I own all of them. each Cd has 10 tracks. My daughter is 3 years old. And She grew up listening to these Cds. And now she can sing all these rhymes along by heart. I wish there were more Cds from these singers.
5,Best of the Animals,"Great addition to the later album, Best of Eric Burden and the Animals.Has the classic favorites, House of the Rising Sun, Don't Let me Down,and other good songs."
2,Best of The Animals,I was expecting a CD with music I was familiar with....only a few were to my liking. The Best of the Animals was a disappointment.
4,Boom Boom This,"I grew up on this album on vinyl - and always loved it. Eric Burdon is a classic soul shouter - deeper than Mitch Ryder or Joe Cocker on an all-out John Lee Hooker bender. The CD adds tracks originally on Animal Tracks that fill it out nicely. BUT, like others, I was very disappointed by the inferior version of We Gotta Get Out of this Place that just doesn't have the power or atmosphere of the version on the original LP. That's the subtracted star."
2,"Great Hits, Very Poor Master","This is a great compilation of the Animals, no doubt. Sadly, the sound is barely audible and does a serious disservice to a potentially great CD. People responsible should remedy their engineering mess by remastering this critical music."
5,The Animals at their best.,"Blues from an unliokely source -- Newcastle. Yet the Animals produced some of the best songs of the 1960's: House of the Rising Sun, We Gotta Get Out of This Place, Boom Boom, I'm Crying, etc. If you have any interest is acquiring an Animals CD, this is the one to get."
3,Animals Tamed,"Eric Burdon and the Animals were one of the bands that had a heavy impact on the London RnB and Rock scene, and this collection does a fair job of crediting them. But it makes a big boner of a mistake by putting in an alternate version of ""We Gotta Get Out Of This Place."" Ah well.But if you want the cool songs ""House of The Rising Sun"" and ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,"" they are both here. Missing is ""Sky Pilot"" or any material from later albums likeBefore We Were So Rudely Interruptedor the 80's reunionArk. The bulk of the album covers the songs Mickie Most brought to the group in 64-66, and before Alan Price (he who created the incredible organ riff on ""House Of The Riding Sun"") left the group. As such, it has a lot of the band's covers and is a worthy set. Too much is missing to make it invaluable."
3,Real Rock and hammering beat,"We gotta get out of this place, these were the words and the tune that I lived for day in and day out, when I was serving in that place of jungle rotting stench of the war in 1969. My sanity and life servived through this great tune. Hearing this music reminds me of those times in the mess with my mates,beer and getting over things with the Animals, Rocking and getting back to the real world."
5,The Best of the Animals,Very good. All the songs that are loved by the recipient of the CD.J Dutton.
3,Not My Favorite Music,I like a few songs on this CD but hate the rest. It is OK. The seller sent the merchandise in great condition. Thank You.
3,Domestic,"While the Animals had some amazing songs such as ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"", ""It's My Life"", and ""We Gotta Get Out Of This Place"" (all, thankfully, included here), most of this album sounds to me like second rate Them/Stones leftovers. Granted, there are worse groups to cop your sound from, but most of this is pretty forgettable. Nice voice, though...."
2,"""Why"" you ask?","Because most everybody wanted to stick a dirty sock down Eric Burdon's mouth, that's why. The Animals were great (a later incarnation included Andy Summers), but Burdon just absolutely alienated anyone with an IQ of greater than ""10"" by his flat vocals and his embarrassingly poor Jagger imitation."
2,Extremly spicy nothing else,"The main thing I can say about this jerky is that it is hot. The problem is that's all I taste. I would of liked the jerky to have a good texture/taste to go along with the spicyness, but it seems that the manufactures only goal was to make the jerky as hot as they could period."
2,Shattuck should make up his mind,"This book has been summarized already by previous reviewers, so I won't rehash that. I agree with the reader from Austin that this book was very disappointing. To me, it seemed as if Shattuck couldn't decide whether the book should be literary criticism or historical overview or a chance for him to air out his morals. He tried to do all three at once, resulting in a bit of a mess. He kept switching back and forth between objective history lesson and subjective moralizing to the point where the points he professed to be trying to make became somewhat lost and pointless. The objective bits were dry and boring and the moralizing was condescending and annoying and insulting to the reader."
3,Worthy,"I find the concept of forbidden knowledge a profound one. Mr. Shattucks has raised some important questions, especially in relation to science and scientific resonsibility.However, I wish the ""forbidden knowledge"" question had been extended to the realm of psychology. That would have been thought provoking as well, especially in our hyper analyzed, over examined and obsessive age. On the whole,I found the book dry and tedious, and I finished it with difficulty."
1,Deplorable Scholarship,"This work by Roger Shattuck is the worst piece of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The lack of intellectual integrity is astounding, especially for someone so high up in the academic world. His arguments are poorly reasoned and replete with terrible, mis-represented anecdotes which serve more to disprove his hypothesis than to sustain it. This book will appeal to those who secretly wish to resort back to the good ol' days when life was simple and God was still an unassailable reality, but for those of a higher intellectual nature, this book is a travesty."
2,A thinly veiled polemic...Shattuck weighs in on the 'culture war',"This book is, frankly, pathetic. Shattuck puts his incredible erudition to work in the service of his conservative Christian convinctions, to write a book that fundamentally condemns intellectual curiosity and advocates institutional obedience. This, from the man who wrote THE BANQUET YEARS, one of the best intellectual histories of fin-de-siecle Paris. In his old age, Shattuck apparently feels compelled to take a stand on the subject of society's increasing liberality, which leaves him feeling threatened. I knew Shattuck personally. I was one of his students in Boston. Professor Shattuck, this book is contrary to the spirit of UNI."
2,a dull book with clever marketing,"If you are thinking about buying this book, please understand that this is a long philosophical inquiry into whether we should seek limits to what we know or learn. It is not a catalog of information that was surpressed. It is very learned and mostly uses literary examples to explore this dilemma. It does not examine any of the information on what we currently believe to be limitations on what is knowable (i.e. quantum theory, uncertainty and incompleteness), nor does it go into a broad range of subjects on what information is dangerous to have.It reads like a very well written piece of literary criticism, and I suspect that most people who buy this book will not finish it, nor enjoy it. I was mislead by the title in a book club publication and wish I hadn't purchased it."
4,Love it,"Bra is very comfortable. I would prefer back hooks instead of pull over, but once it is in place, it's great!"
4,Diamond Stud Earrings,"I bought these earrings for my wife as a Christmas present. All I can say is she was so surprised that it made me every happy I got them.We just got married in October, and she had no idea that she would get more diamonds so soon.They where a big hit. If you want to make your wife/girlfriend happy buy her a pair.R Walker"
3,Not a good color stone for white gold.,"I want to start out by saying that the price can't be beat. I checked a local jeweler and he didn't have any diamonds this size for less than $850 a pair. However, stones put in white gold settings should have better color than this because of the contrast. The yellowish tint of the diamonds is pretty obvious. I would recommend that you buy a smaller, better-color, stone rather than these."
2,Poor Quality,"14K White Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (3/4ctw, J-K, I2-I3)I received these earrings as a Christmas gift and we were really dissappointed in the quality. The diamonds were cloudy and one was, it looked like off center.I sent them back and bought from someone else."
2,Ugly pieces,"I got them on sale for much cheaper, but i'm still disappointed. Color is acceptable but the construction and material (even when it's white gold) feels weak. The clarity is worst than described which is in the end of clarity scale. Cut is extremely poor but there's no way to check this since only AGS lab can certify cut grade for princess cut diamonds :(i'm gonna return it and look for something more fancy, at least I in color, VS1, platinum bezel and has a good cut :)it's still a cheap pair of diamond studs but i won't dare giving this to my mom :("
2,JUST OK!!!,"The picture is not the same quality as, I received during this transaction. My girlfriend loves them in spite of the milky looking stones."
1,"the pentagon""s new map hits #1",yesterday i had an interview with thomas p.m. barnetthe is a funny man he writes mystyrey books but some timeshororror action he wrote this book for his wife
2,A Galaxy Wide and An Inch Deep,"There are nuggets here but most of the meat of the book consists of broad, unsubstantiated assertions. And only about half is ""meat""--the rest is nauseating, narcissistic self-praise with a smattering of ""defense 101"" level information. Dr. Barnett takes credit for inventing many ideas that other strategic thinkers developed first and with much more rigor. In general, the book is like a pop song--its ""hooks"" stick in the mind but it's no symphony built on development, depth, and nuance. As a result, the important arguments in it aren't made convincingly, but are simply asserted or suggested."
1,needles for thought in a wind-bag haystack,"The good thing about this book is that the author has some exciting and insightful ideas about the future of the world (nothing trivial here!) and what America needs to do to cope, especially the Pentagon. There are some fascinating data on world economics and demographics as well as entertaining insights on the world of government operations and bureaucracy.Unfortunately, these nuggets are almost buried in a turgid writing style, relentless self-promotion and bragging, and almost limitless mountains of jargon. Fundamentally, I decided this book is really about the author and how right he is about things; this almost swamps the enjoyable parts of the book, which have to be looked for and dug out of the verbiage. Overall: save your money and read the lengthy reviews here on Amazon."
5,Excellent primer on how policies develop....,"This book is a *must-read* for anyone interested in how the US gov't. policies & processes were not ready for the post-Soviet world. If you are a Fed, manager or 'in-the-trenches', this should be required reading to understand that the boxes of bureacracy impede the flexible thinking required by today's world and fast-moving technology.The style is very readable, almost like you're sitting with Barnett in his office. He has made the process of intelligence & policy-making accessible, and I'm continually amazed how similar my own experiences with government work are to his analyst work. (Basically, if you have something different to say, or have an 'out of the box' solution, you're in for a difficult time.)Highly recommended!!!"
5,an excellent book,"A must-read for political scientists, confirmed or budding, interested in a glimpse down the road at conflicts to come, and, perhaps more relevantly, at the ways in which the business world, a.k.a. globalization, will take the steam out of numerous conflicts as ""under connected"" regions dial into modernity. Strongly recommended."
3,Core and Gap are defined by states,"The concept of Core and Gap in the book are useful, but the problem is he uses them to classify entire states as being either in theCore or being in the Gap. The reality is that in the US, Mexico, India, China, and many other nations that he listed there are geographical areas where communities are part of the Gap, and in places in the Middle East, in Africa, in the Andes there are small enclaces where the communities are part of the Core.The idea of using traditional national boundaries to draw the line between Core and Gap is wrong. Core and Gap is really on a scale, invllving a number of attributes.The book has useful ideas, but the essential ideas can be gathered from the Esquire article."
1,Barnett loves Barnett,"I had heard that Barnett held himself in high esteem--I just didn't realize it would go on for 448 pages. He spends the first 30 pages discussing how innovative and brilliant he is. I was disappointed to find out that this is what passes for intellectual argument these days. There is little here that wasn't in the international development literature from the late 1970's and early 1980's. It just seemed new because the previous works were forgotten. He lost his remaining brownie points when he mentioned natural gas (CH4) as a carbon free energy source. I didn't even take organic chemistry and knew that was wrong. Solar, wind, nuclear--carbon free. Still curious, read his Esquire article instead. At least that editor was able to keep his ego in check. Check it out from the library instead of wasting the money."
3,A Solid Theory On Where America Should Be Heading,"This book presents a map for the future of America and backs them up with a lot of good explanations. It also lists out several things that must, or SHOULD, occur for our country to acheive this goal. The only problem I had with this book is that some of the theories and ideas seem to be repeated over and over again. I feel that the first 300 or so pages could have been shortened to about 100. Other than that, I think the book is a decent read."
1,perfumed prince?,"A better title for this book would have been ""What it is Like to be the Smartest Civilian Employee in the Pentagon."" Anyone looking for relevant nuts-and-bolts insight and direction into Defense Department policy matters should stick with Ralph Peters and Robert Kaplan."
2,empty and long winded rhetoric,"This book is stylistically a miserable failure. Barnett apparently likes big words and grand metaphors, but usually uses them for no particular purpose, other than to sound like a typical DC blowhard at a cocktail party. As for analysis, there's a lot more ink spilled about how many generals wait breathlessly for Mr. Barnett's prescient analyses, rather than any actual analysis. One xample of how miserably idiotic this book is: in his ""map"" of the the ""pentagon's new map,"" he includes Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand, and Slovakia are part of his ""Non-Integrating Gap,"" those countries which are failed and failing states because they are not integrated into the larger global political economy. Since when do EU and NATO member states count as ""non-integrated."" Or countries with high levels of trade, foreign investment, and GDP growth? A simplistic book for simpletons."
5,The Pentagon's New Map,"If you frequently watch cable news and read the daily newspapers looking for insight concerning world events, you're missing something important - a comprehensive perspective. Thomas Barnett has given us just such an overview. At last I feel like I truly understand what is going on in this world and how it will affect our future. This is a must read, a very important work."
4,kThe Pentagon's New Map,"Barnett has some very good ideas, however he's clearly wrong on other issues, and he get's invloved in some very courious circular agruments. He spends much too time talking about himself, friends and sorta of useless antedotal stories. I think it is worth reading but one should be cautious about buying into everything he says."
5,Teaching tool,"I have been teaching Old Testament for twenty years and this title has keen insights that other commentaries have missed. The structure of the book is novel, presenting verse insight separated from the author's opinion and interpretation. This allows the reader to ""get the facts"" and then see what the author thinks about them. Very helpful in allowing the reader to come to their own conclusions first. The introduction and summaries are helpful as well."
2,No stereo,"The 2 star rating is not for the music, but because of the mono sound. I have this music in true stereo and it sounds terrific. Unfortunately, it's on vinyl, not CD. I hope that this is corrected soon. There's lots of room on a CD to put mono and stereo versions so that everybody'll be happy."
5,SUPER C D,"MANY YEARS AGO, I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE RONETTES PERFORM AT A MURRAY THE K ROCK AND ROLL SHOW............WHEN THESE SONGS WERE NEWAND A FEW YEARS AGO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING RONNIE , AND HAVING HER AUTOGRAPH THIS C D ...........SHE STILL HAS THE MAGIC AND PIZAZZSHE HAD ON THAT STAGE AT THE BROOKLYN PARAMOUNT............ALL THOSE YEARS AGO...............I WISH SHE WOULD DO MORE CONCERTS........SHES JUST WONDERFUL.........AND THE SONGS ON THIS C D........TRULY ARE MAGICIF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE RONETTES, THE FIRST GIRL SUPER SEXY GROUPTHIS C D IS A MUST HAVE...........ROCK ON!!!!......AND KEEP THE MUSIC ALIVE"
5,"Good mono, even better in stereo","Anyone who is a Phil Spector fan of the ""wall of sound"" will really enjoy this CD. Wisely, Spector chose not to go digital with these classic recordings, as not to alter the original sound. It's just too bad the Stereo versions of nearly all the original Philles ""Presenting"" cuts of the album by the Ronettes were not made in Stereo for this CD. I have the original Stereo Ronettes album, and the songs ""Baby, I Love You"" and ""I Wonder"" sound really spectacular in stereo, all that orchestration is very detailed, while somewhat muted in the mono version. Hal Blaine's opening drum solo on ""I Wonder"" is absent on the mono version. In any event, I love playing this CD in the car, it brings back a lot of memories. Someday, maybe the Stereo masters (if they are not lost) will be re-issued."
2,Rip Off,"I know for a fact that all of these tracks were originally released in ""STEREO"" but I guess ABKCO has NEVER heard of the word. This CD is a complete rip off for audio philes. The quality is okay but as for ""re-mixing""? What re-mixing except from Stereo to Mono.If all you're seeking is the music, it's okay, I guess.I'll probably be selling it and it's a double whammy for me as a Canadian as I had to pay in US funds as this CD is not available in Canada."
3,Doesn't sound as good as they did back then,"As a teenager the Ronettes sounded like a great girl group, which they were while they lasted. Listening to them over and over, though, it seems like Ronnie (Veronica Spector) had to strain a little to sing the slow songs. She sounds more comfortable (and better) with the up tempo songs like ""Be My Baby"", ""Do I Love You?"", and ""I Wonder"". ""Walking In The Rain"" was the exception, she did very well with that one. But not a bad album all things considered."

4,Ronnie Rocks,This is some great rock and roll. I just wish they would have included I Can Hear Music. It would be awsome if digitally remastered
5,Amazing!,"I'm a guy, so the idea of paying more than $100 for a pot was - to me - pretty ridiculous. But then I got this thing. WOW. The handles are secure, far away from the pot itself (so they don't get hotter than they have to) and have an easy grip coating on them. The pyrex top makes it easy to see what's actually going on in the pot so you don't have to pull the cover off and get a blast of steam in your face. And the non-stick coating!!!! Stuff just slides out of there. Plus, the bottom surface is set up to heat everything evenly.I am seriously impressed."
5,Scanpan 4 Quart Stock Pot,"I've had Scanpans for more than 12 years. This pot was an addition to my set and is quickly becoming my favorite pan for cooking soups, pastas, etc. now that there are just two of us at home. Clean up is very easy. Love my Scanpans!"
4,"A Picture's Worth 1000 Words, Part-2!","This is the Part Two of Mangajin's Basic Japanese Through Comics. It provides another 24 lessons of some common japanese phrases (e.g. yappari, abunai, maitta, daijoubu, iya, mono, dekite, etc.) As the name of the book suggested, the author used different manga pictures to depict the common japanese phrases in different meanings with different contexts. The author also indicated the politeness level (i.e. Lv 1,2,3,4) for each usage to help the readers use the phrases properly in various siturations. If you're currently studying Japanese and in between beginner and intermediate levels, this book is a treasure for you to benefit your proficiency in Japanese.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 03-July-2007)"
3,"Ok, If you like horror, you might as well watch it","OK movie but like so many Asia movies (Suicide Club,The Eye), the stories are great but they end up going nowhere, they give you extra characters and facts that have nothing to do with the end result and sometimes even contradict the story. I must admit, I did jump a couple of times but foreign films also don't capture the moment by increasing the volume of the special effects for that added chill.Disclaimer: I'm using the same review for The Eye.Rent-YesBuy-Maybe"
4,Sort of a Hong Kong version of the Sixth Sense,"Leslie Cheung plays a man with a secret. He begins a descent into madness when he starts seeing a dead girl from his past. Memories churn as he is haunted by her. The film slowly builds in suspense until it climaxes in an unexpected ending which is not one that you'd see in most Hollywood films.Leslie Cheung is great in his last role. If one is a fan of Leslie Cheung or Hong Kong horror/suspense films, then I'd reccomend getting it."
3,Exhaustive research data still leads to false conclusion,"There is a lot of good historical data in the book used to support a strong case. Worthy of serious consideration for the thinking man. However the book is also misleading. Anarchy will not take us through the door to a better world. Governments will fight back and hard and entrench deeper leading to one world government and a world dictator.Our present system c/w it's obvious flaws needs to be loved, appreciated and carefully guarded in spite of it's inevitable decline.The Taliban and terrorist activities will only serve to strengthen USA into a much greater super power."
5,bold assertations - cold realities,"I purchased 5000 shares of an underpriced north american steel company the other day at 50 cents and sold it at 80 cents three days later. From a sunny beach in a secluded area from my cell phone. I got it. I get it. Each day I receive - online - for free - technical commodity trading charts. Oh by the way - I know how to read charts - took a most excellent course. If you feel that big brother is not your best friend and that there is something more - read the book. If not for yourself - for your children. Take your time, it is worth it. The authors deserve much credit and probably received very little pay - but - some of us get it - thanks. PS. Do not allow yourself to feel negative when you read about possible downsides of things to come - perhaps the authors try a bit to hard to make you feel sick - remember this - you and only you can make yourself well. kh"
2,What a bunch of misplaced concreteness,"Reification (also known as hypostatisation, concretism, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) is a fallacy of ambiguity, when an abstraction (abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete, real event, or physical entity. I counted over 100 in the first chapter. How many do you count?"
4,A Nightmare for Civilization,"An inside look at ""The Plan"" for what is now the accelerated destruction of civilization brought to us by a couple of guys with their hands in it. Are Lord Rees-Mogg and Davidson RIIA (Royal Institute of International Affairs)? They certainly look like RIIA / CFR types. Read and learn."
1,James Dale Davidson - a scammer,"Before you buy any of his books, make sure you research his previous books. I have never seen anyone so wrong, from his book ""The Plague of the Black Debt."" From that book, ""...Bill Clinton is going to be a one-term President. He's going to get clobbered in the '96 election....I'm as sure of this as I am that the sun will rise tomorrow."" He got 1/2 of that right. ""...Bill Clinton's failure will take place against a backdrop of deep depression, urban riots, and people losing their homes.""none of this happened in when he wrote this trash in 1992, nor 2007. It was a scam for his Strategic Investment Limited Partnership.Research this clown first!"
2,"Very fanciful, not data-driven","This vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object's future behavior. People have many connections to a place, which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations. These emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and ""at-will"" citizens for a long time to come.In reading the book, by the way, the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern, American style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends. It's much more in an old fashioned English amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it's all sort of breezy. Some may like that."
4,"Great Job, but can't equal Mike Live!","Fortunately, we Manhattanites have been able to listen to Mike on a semi-regular basis live at great places like the Bitter End. This album is good, very good...but the added instrumentation adds unneeded complexity to such beautiful songs. To see Mike Live is an ephemeral experience, please try to catch him when he comes to your area.Until then, this album, along with his two self-produced ones will be more than enough to tide you over."
5,Buy it NOW!,An absolutely incredible cd. Mike Errico mixes soulful music with smart lyrics to produce something that is so unique and stunning.
4,MORE LIVE MIKE!!!,"First things last - Mike Errico is one of the few musicians who, the first time I heard his stuff (about six months ago), I could feel my life changing. His music has an honesty, a vitality, and an energy that is incredibly rare in today's music. My only gripe with ""Pictures"" is that, with the additional instrumentation, it fails to capture the complexity of his music as well as his live solo performances (that's rare these days too: an act that's actually *better* live). But, it is nonetheless a promising debut, with excellent versions of the songs from his self-produced albums, and a bunch of til-now-unrecorded ones as well. Here's hoping this album is a (much-deserved) career springboard for Mr. E., leading him to the kind of success that will one day produce ""Errico Comes Alive,"" so the world can hear what we New Yorkers have been lucky enough to be privvy to."
5,Best CD I have bought in years,"Clearly this up and coming talent has arrived. I could not imagine a more entertaining, witty, relaxing musical menagerie to both brighten up a day and use as background for almost any activity. I hope we will soon be able to enjoy another delightful CD from this gifted musician. (I was especially entertained by his operatic interludes from a 1950-ish recording.)"
5,"I laughed, I cried","I have all of Mike Errico's albums and they just keep getting better. This one has a permanent home in my CD player -- I listen to it constantly. Mike's lyrics crack me up every time, his voice gets me in the stomach, and he does these things with his guitar.... the only thing better is seeing him live."
4,Desk top replacement,"What else Can I say about this big bad laptop. One of my favorite laptop, I still put my powerbook 650 the top.Keyboard design really comfort.Mouse pad is Ok even with the new C pad I like the Sticky note . It is cool.Display it is better than the 16 Uxga of sony.Big hard drive 60 gig (only 4200 rpm)not 5400 rpm like some source quote.Battery is 1H5 mim without run intensive program thumb down, but remember it the laptop replacement.Run solid in XP and Linux.The only I complain is I call the tech support ask for memory upgrade I said yes but He was wrong It is capable to go up 1gig but you must spend a big bug for it because 512 meg is use by 2 x 256 meg and there is no no upgrade.I rate it 4 stars for it performant cool design but the battery and memory upgrade pull it down instaed of 4.5."
5,Great Book,"I picked up a copy of this book at Goodwill. I can tell whoever donated it had not even read it. I decided to start reading it early on a Sunday morning. WOW, I finished it Sunday afternoon. Once you get started you can't put it down. I carried it with me reading as I went to the kitchen to make lunch and hardly put it down.It is an absolutely enjoyable book. An incredible love story with so many other stories interwoven. You cry, you get happy, your moods swing around with the characters in this book, it is amazing.You will not be sorry to pick this book up. I came online hoping to find more by this author, he is very gifted.Enjoy!!"
3,Not a Rattletrap Car,"We absolutely fell in love with Rattletrap Car and have been in love with it for well over a year now. I bought Kiss the Cow! simply because of the recommendations and my love for the other Phyllis Root book but . . . while it's worth having as an inexpensive paperback, for me it is not one I envision myself worrying about saving for my daughter to read to her kids one day."
1,worst kettle ever.,"Hardly attractive, nearly impossible to use... the silicone whistle must be removed for pouring, but becomes hot and slick due to the (duh) hot water behind it. The handle has severe edges that making pouring even a single cup uncomfortable, and the dramatic curve of the handle makes holding it securely impossible. Lastly, the silicon AND finish began to peel after only a few uses. An awful, unfortunate design!"
2,Blinq teakettle,"The kettle is beautiful, but uncomfortable to use. The handle is sharp and after only a few uses, the enamel started to chip around the spout from removing the whistler for pouring."
3,"They fit OK, but lacking in quality","These fit my 5 year old son well, but the earmuffs are pretty low quality. The little metal supports on the sides that allow for adjustability are a bit flimsy. The foam inside the earmuffs is VERY thin and looked like it was already coming out when I removed the earmuffs from the packaging. While these will work for now, I don't see them lasting too long in the hands of a 5 year old. Only time will tell."
5,pfaltzgraff sugar and creamer,"I love this sugar and creamer. It is very durable, as well as dishwasher and microwave safe."
2,This is not the book to learn nonlinear optics from,This book is simply not very helpful as a textbook or as a reference. Shen seems to want to create a catalog of all nonlinear phenomena. He gives both too much (mathematical) and too little (practical) information on each subject. The mathematics does not really go beyond Bloembergen's little book.
2,neptune: an illustrated history,I looked at all the pictures on the internet site for this book. It showed pictures of LA-9 and pictures for VP-5. La-9 crashed in Iceland and all aboard were killed. It took Retired Navy shipmates 30 years to get the remains back to the US. None of the pictures of LA-9 were in the book. There were no pictures of VP-5 Mad Foxes in the book. The add was misleading. Because I was in VP-5 I really wanted to see the pictures of LA-9. I have seen pictures of the crew but not of the real plane. Was in hopes I would and have something to share with other VP-5 shipmates.Good pictures of P2-V'sArnold
3,Ringmaster eaten by mods!,"A great showcase for a live band at the peak of their powers. That band is, of course, the Who. The Stones themselves sound pretty sloppy, and Salt Of The Earth is a cheat, being a backing tape to which Jagger sings live. (Jethro Tull mime too -- naughty Ian!) The other high point is the bone-crunching take on Yer Blues by Lennon, Clapton et al. Fairly mediocre -- one can understand why the band refused to release it at the time. Ah, but crank up the Who again ..."
4,When comes the likes of these again?,"I was so glad when this was finally released. It contains a riveting performance by John Lennon. It also contains a fascinating blend of classical violin, Yoko wailing, and powerhouse rock band. The Who's number is polished. Taj Mahal and the other opening acts acquit themselves well. The Stones' performance is varied, but it's great to hear them onstage from this important period."
3,"Taj, Who and Faithful steal it","I don't know who was backing her or who arranged it, but Marianne Faithful's song is absolutely killer...I couldn't disagree more with those who say it is weak. Great lyrics, melody, slide guitar...i got this for Taj, Who and Tull, but Marianne blows them all away."
5,the stones,A collection of a live show that included John Lennon and Eric Clapton. It's great. I recieved it fast and in great shape.
4,those were the days,"The Stones, John Lennon, Eric Clapton, The Who: A snapshot in Rock and Roll History, (before everyone grew to hate Yoko). I think one of the last live Stones shows with Brian. The Who are at their carnival best. Clapton does Yer' Blues better on the Live Peace in Toronto album, (when everyone started to hate Yoko). The rest of the players are just OK."
5,"captivating,","this video is a classic. jethro tull starts the concert out with a very real performance. the who, Marianne faithful, and especially taj mahal give great performances. then mick sits down w/john lennon to introduce the band john plays w/quite a performance w/clapton on lead guitar , mitch mitchells from experience on drums and keith richards on guitar. then yoko joins them.the finale is by the stones who give incredible perfomances on every cut. they follow sympathy of the devil, which easily could have been the finale w/salt of the earth. its a very touching number. buy this dvd, you will be gald you did enjoy dharma"
3,The WHO shines,"You don't get much better than this if you're a Who fan. This performance of A Quick One is without a doubt the finest ever recorded. It is a true gem. The Who manage to play tight, seamless, powerful, in your face music. And they're having a blast. But the point is it's right there. Everything else on the record pales in comparison. The Stones were just on too many drugs (although Sympathy for the Devil comes out great). Tull is tight, but emotionless. The Lennon/Clapton thing is okay at best, and Yoko should never have been allowed near the microphone if not the stage, or even the studio for that matter. The Who is the high point. It's really too bad that that era in the Who's musical development could not have lasted longer. But then again, ""Music must change."""
1,Too Bland,This album was a big disappointment. Titles and arrangements were rather blah. Not one I'd listen to again.
3,Romance is in the ears of the beholder . . .,"Although the selection of songs here seems like it would make a good choice for a romantic evening at home, there is something about the feeling of being rushed through the album, and through the desire of setting the tone of romance. Not the seductive, sensual, romantic flow of music that one would select to nuture the atmoshere of Amore'. It's more of a singalong for background music while doing chores."
5,GREAT BOOKS!!! (That last guy is clueless),"Sorry... just had to comment. The EXAM CRAM books are by far offer the best ""bang for your buck"" in terms of studying for any Microsoft certification.Of the seven tests I have taken, each corresponding EXAM CRAM book covered the requested material in great detail. This series is an invaluable must read for anyone who takes their pursuit of certification seriously."
4,Something For Nothing,"If the cry babies out there expect to get something for nothing then too bad. The MCSE exams require a lot of hard work. I have yet to see any single material that covers those exams, these books are effective for their purpose, but to think that these and these alone will get you your certification is incorrect. If you don't start out with the mind set that these exams are very intensive and require very intensive study then you are probably not cut out to be MCSE to begin with. Davina Lindstrom"
4,Excellent supplement material,I do not recommend using these books without other material. I have found a few errors but over all I believe they have been a great study companion. I reccommend them to all my MCSE students.
4,If you study These You Will Pass,This is just a comment on one of previous the reviews. These books are an asset for anyone with a bit of pre-existing knowledge on the topic. They have proven to be very acurate in covering the content of the exams. Myself and many of my associates have found these books to be a valuable asset for passing the exams. I personnaly have used only these books to pass the MCSE exams. And on the first try.
4,better than an outdoor grill,"I've gone through many gas grills over the years, & this is the best way to grill indoors. Been using it to make turkey burgers every weekend for over 2 months, & I really like this pan. Food doesn't stick to it, it's solid, easy to clean, & the price was very reasonable. Definitely would recommend it to others.UPDATE: after 1 year, the coating started rubbing off. I replaced this with a Lodge cast iron grill pan. Only thing that could flake off now is olive oil. I doubt that'll negatively affect me."
5,These drummers will blow your mind!,"I was lucky to see Kodo live in Milwaukee this year in February. A friend went with me and as we were entering a restarant for dinner before the show, we could hear Kodo practicing inside the theatre across the busy four-lane street! And talk about amazing: these guys can drum their hearts out and not be tired after twenty minutes! If you get the chance, see them live and then get the video. Kodo rocks the world!"
1,"unreliable, inaccurate","We have one of these... actually two... and they consistently give inconsistent ratings--we couldn't figure out what temp our aquarium was really at, since when the heater kicked on was unrelated to what the thermometer said, and as we moved one around the aquarium it would vary by as much as 10 degrees and so when we got one for our second tank and found IT had inconsistent results too, we put the two thermometers next to each other--just 1/2 inch apart, and they're typically about 8 degrees different. I have no idea which--if either--is accurate, or whether they both fade into and out of accuracy."
4,It's not that bad!!,"Not quite sure why most of the reviewers here hated this movie so much...while it's no Oscar winner, it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It's your typical low budget, family friendly movie. The two biggest bonuses are Kate Bosworth (love her!) and Matt McCoy, whom you might remember from the early 90's thriller ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"". At times the dialog is painfully hokey, but it's not bad enough to ruin the movie. If you like family films, give it a try!"
3,for a younger audience,"This documentary has many reenactments and features a young, female narrator speaking as Sacagawea. This work doesn't have the sophistication that one finds in PBS' ""American Experience"" series. However, that series is for adults. This documentary is surely made for a younger audience. It's the type of work that an elementary school teacher could show while killing time before the Thanksgiving holiday begins. So when you take it for its intention, then you may find it acceptable or decent."
1,"Childish at Best, Insult to Native Americans at worst","This DVD should have been recommended for 12 year olds and under. It could be appropriate for a 6th grade geography class. I would not have bought it had I known it offered nothing about the Native American side of the story. Classifying it as Native American would be an insult. I wish I could return it, but I'll have to offer it as a low-end ""give-away"".Margretta Chase 12/25/2010"
3,"Decent, but lacks adventure",This film tells the basic story from Sacagawea's perspective. I have read the Lewis and Clark diaries and there are some pretty exciting confrontations with other parties (even a gun battle) that aren't referenced in this film. I think the film could have been made a bit more exciting by including some of the harrowing experiences of the party.
4,Second Rocks,"More Hot Rocks suffers from the little brother syndrome. The first Hot Rocks release contained all the Stones classics, while this one has the band's lesser hits and album tracks. Obviously it is not as strong the first Hot Rocks compilation, but it does have some great material and makes for a nice compliment to the first set. The inclusion of several songs that were previously only released in England and two unreleased tracks make this set mandatory for any Stones completist."
2,Another wasted opportunity,"Thanks to the first volume's extremely short running time, there were plenty of hits and classics left over for a volume two. This is it. The original side four of the vinyl double album collected a number of UK-only Stones sides; none of them are essential. Sound is variable -- the early tracks are rather bad, but from 1966 on is okay. Surely, though, it's time this rather expensive compilation and its companion were deleted in favour of a new set which made use of the CD running time and featured rather more intelligent selections and sequencing?"
2,And a disapointing yawn slips from me,"I was very upset that ""Rocks off"" ""Rip this Joint"" and ""Monkey Man"" were not on here. Those are better than most the other songs on here. Buy the 1st Hot Rocks, it is far more supperior. If it did have the songs I listed, I'd probley given it 3-4 stars"
3,Totally inferior to Hot Rocks,"If you're new to the Rolling Stones, or have limited income and can only ""sample"" this remarkable band, then the double album to buy is not this one, but the vastly superior ""Hot Rocks."" This is a disappointing collection which contains songs no self-respecting Stones fac would listen to more than twice.Disc two is especially weak and contains some Stones songs recorded during their lyrical and creative nadir in the 70's. This compilation can't hold a candle to other Greatest Hits packages, such as the famous Beatles red Greatest Hits album.Disc one fares much better, and it's good to see the underrated classic ""I'm Free"" prominently featured, one of the Stones greatest pseudo-ballads, not a genre in which they have traditionally excelled.This will give the novice a good compass from which to gauge the Stones and you can branch from here, though again, ""Hot Rocks"" is the much superior record."
4,A must have for dog lovers. Very funny.,"According to the introduction, you are to read this book to your dog so they know how to interact with you. I read this book in one night and was laughing the whole time. It is the story of Boomer and takes him from how to get into the house to running it.I enjoyed this book very much because Boomer's behavior was the same as my Golden Retriever. It was as if the author was writing about her."
3,"My Favorite Martian, Vol. 3 & 4","5 Stars for the show, one star for this DVD. My Favorite Martian is one of the all time good shows you and your family may enjoy.But beware, this DVD only has 4 episodes on it. All 4 are contained in the 1st season set for only 11.00 more money. So instead of getting 4 shows for 13.00, you get 37 shows for 24.00. The title of vol. 3 & 4 is confusing. There is no vol. 3 & 4. Amazon needs to change it to reflect only 4 shows, which make the cost per show very expensive. Try the full season, you will be glad you did."
1,Different than Complete Season 1 and 2-?,I have the season 1 and 2.Is this the 'ever-waited-for' finishing season/s for the series-?
2,"CPU makes too much HEAT, 2.2Ghz lots of heat inside!!","This laptop gets very hot after 15 minutes!!No wonder where the heat is coming from 2.2Ghz, buy 1.6Ghz or less .1.6 Ghz runs more cooler than this melting notbook!"
4,Fante Revealed,"This book provides an excellent account of the California screenwriter and novelist's life, and an eminently readable interpretation of his works in terms of his life as an Italian-American author. This is essential reading for anyone interested in Fante and in the Italian-American experience."
1,Bunch of BS,The orginal theatre version should of been in the 2004 triology boxed set.Will not be shelling out close to $60 just to view the orginals.
1,Can I give this ZERO stars?,George Lucas is a scam artist. He should be reported to the FTC and the Better Business Bureau. Peddling recycled products gives a true indication of his limited abilities. Think about it. What was the last thing this charlatan put out that had nothing to do with Star Wars that actually had any merit? Pity the people that maintain his grotesque Star Wars cottage industry.
1,"I'm not going to bite this time, George!","Here I am looking at a promo poster from the 1995 VHS release of the origial trilogy. It was given out at a few stores on the day the VHS's were made available. A hard to find item, for sure. Contact me if you want a photo of it. It says, ""The original. One last time."" I got it framed and loved having it. Now it's a lie. Jeez!"
1,Huge Disappointment!!,"I was so excited to hear about this release then it turned out that the original Star Wars movies, offered as bonus material, are nothing more than non-anamorphic 1993 laser disc reproduction after thoughts on DVD.This release is not for the fans; George Lucas long ago forgot about them, this release is all about combating the bootleg DVD market (where the original Star Wars trilogy has been a mainstay for years). The tragedy is this release is no better than the bootlegs it's trying to combat! It's essentially, an ""official"" original Star Wars bootleg DVD.Very sad to continue seeing George Lucas and Lucasfilm treat this trilogy with such disrespect.The Special Edition DVDs are included here as well (and yes, they are still the ""Special Editions"" that have been hacked up with slapstick CGI and storytelling gaffs, even if they don't say ""Special Edition"" any longer)."
4,A Great Film For All To Enjoy,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie as I have seen a lot of hyped up movies that turned out to stink to high heaven. But 'Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope,' matched the hype and thoroughly impressed me. The ending felt a little rushed, for my taste anyway, but I still really liked this film. A lot. 'Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope,' is a great film for all to enjoy."
2,I don't get this,"This isn't fair, Mr. Lucas! But then again, I guess ""life ain't fair"". Why is he releasing the 2004 digitally tweaked editions of the film again, with the unaltered 1977 version of the film? He's making a fool of himself! I've got an idea! I can buy all 2-disc sets, and just take the first disc out! One of the other guys that said something about remastering the original version without deliberately but obviously and inflexibly destroying the original film's reputation:* High-definition on the new Blu-ray discs* Still keep the original aspect ratio (2.35 : 1)* DTS 6.1, and the new 7.1 surround sound* The original theatrical and teaser trailers* The teaser poster for the film that read in a big font, ""Coming To Your Galaxy This Summer""* The original 1977 documentary ""The Making of Star Wars""* Talent files of all the main people that were in the creditsStill, Mr. Lucas, if you really want to hear OUR views, ""GET RID OF THE 2004 VERSION WHICH ALL OF US OWN!"""
2,DO NOT buy the enhanced edition.,"The new graphics are TERRIBLE. Instead of restoring the existing scenes, George Lucas has gone through and put in these ridiculous computerizations that are very clearly different from the rest of the scene.DO NOT BUY."
5,One of the Best Movies ever made!,"We are all in debt to George Lucas for giving us this wonderful movie! This movie is such a big part of our culture and has influenced so much, it's unreal! A New Hope is great in its Classic form or Special Edition! Combining a wonderful cast, great special effects, and a powerful score by John Williams, Star Wars: A New Hope will be a movie for all ages for decades to come!"
3,A CUTE MOVIE,"I first saw this movie on video last week and I liked it a lot. The new effects were added in it and it had a pretty good storyline. The problems were that some of the acting wasn't portrayed very well and the storyline was too basic. They saved the day too fast. It was like, they did what they had to do and that was the end. Not my favorite in the series, but cute and watchable."
2,Is This The Original Star Wars?,"Apparently not. First of all it was called Star Wars. Isn't Mr. Lucas rich enough? I have not been able to find the original version from 1977 on dvd, you know what that mean Mr. Lucas, it means you don't get my money. I don't want the new edition of a classic film. Time to get a life and move on George. It is a shame that such a talented director got stuck for so long on the same theme. So many from Hollywood have opinions about corporate greed, well they should know. New versions of old movies, new scenes, changed scenes, basically a different film. Spielberg has the same problem. Making new movies is great but changing past movies and ensuring that you can't get the original reminds me of what George Orwell said about controlling the future by rewriting the past. Lucas should know better. Some day they will be doing this with history if they aren't already. That's why we are moving to a paperless society."
3,One Last Time,"When the first version of the Dvd trilogy came out, everyone complained that there were no original trilogy dvd's available (except bootlegs), now that they are available, you complain about something else..I am glad they are finally available on dvd, because I couldn't take having to watch Vhs if I wanted to watch the originals.While it is a bit unfair that we are getting both the changed versions and the originals seeing as most of us already purchased them, and now we have to own them twice, we should all just accept that for the most part we are all suckers and will buy them anyway..!"
2,NOT the greatest movie of all time,"I used to love this movie (until all the crazy fanatics ruined it for me.) This movie's okay, but it's NOT the ideal movie that everyone makes it out to be. The special effects are okay, but not that great compared to other sci-fi movies of the 70's and 80's. The plot is fine, even if it's the same simple ""evil empire fights little group of outgunned rebels"" over again (it's a fairy tale in space.) Yes, it's imaginative, and yes it's got lots of action. It's a great no-brainer movie, since there aren't any subtlties or dramatic characters or subplots. Sit down with a bowl of popcorn on a rainy Saturday afternoon kind of movie. It's a kid's movie. Not the greatest movie of all time."
3,"the robots,special effects stand the test of time well.","Returning to the first Star Wars movie after some 25 years was a moving experience.At the time,it prompted an obsession and sense of awe that lasted atleast two years (i was about eight at the time)...with the passing of time,i was surprised how fascinating the Robots,special effects (in the days before hollow computerized manipulations)and location filming in Morocco (?) remain.I was charmed by all of this,and the baddies have a genuine sense of terror.In the acting department,Peter Cushing (not unlike Goebbels)is particularly convinicing,no doubt aided by the palpable sense of discomfort having to deliver the dismal script.However,even by the standards of light entertainment,the story telling is pretty cluttered and the acting(a few notable exceptions)from the balsa wood school of dramatic art.Whatever the case may be,the initial installment of star wars is an unqualified masterpiece compared to the miserable episode i saw a year or two back."
1,Shut Up,Quit whining. If you dont like the this watch the special editions and close your eyes during the new parts. Theres like 2 minutes added on. Not that bug of a deal.
1,Yuck!,A very bad and lame sci-fi movie stars Mark Hamill. Of coarse it has great special effects and the plot is great!
1,Ditto.,"I know it's been said, but I feel the need to repeat it in this case: George Lucas at this point is just sticking it to the fans. I don't WANT the 2004 versions, I bought that box set when it came out on DVD. I don't want the comic books, either. I just wanted a box set of the original movies. And this time I'm not biting. I don't care that much about the tweaks he made, I'll stick with watching the 2004 releases that I already own and do NOT need another set of. I'm a fan, not a junkie, and definitely not rich enough to keep giving Mr. Lucas money for stuff I already paid him for."
3,ok purchase,I didn't realize that the purchase was only for the disc and the cover didn't come with purchase; only the dvd.
5,Star Wars IV,Of course I like the theatrical version best. Sometimes the enhanced version throws you off - you're not expecting stuff. Good show.
1,This is not the DVD you're looking for ...move along,"There is no point re-hashing what many others have said before. No-one wants to buy this set for the 2004 edtions (surely there is no-one out there who wants that who didn't buy it already?) No, the attention here is on the so-called ""bonus"" features included with the set. These are not the films you're looking for!Vote with your wallets and do not buy this edition. It does not contain the ""theatrical version"" of the film. It is a 1993 Laserdisc transfer which contains many changes from the theatrical releases. It also contains a version which falls far below the standard consumers would expect from a dvd release in 2006."
1,Missed opportunity,"PC: I'm a PC.Mac: And I'm a Mac.PC: Say, Lucasfilm is finally releasing the original theatrical versions of Star Wars on DVD this fall.Mac: Great, I can't wait to pick them up!PC: But...you have to buy the same DVDs you bought last year to get them as bonus discs.Mac: Oh. Well, I guess it's still worth it to me.PC: And...they won't be anamorphic, even though that's been the DVD standard for years.Mac: Guess I can live without them after all. See you around, guy.PC: Wait, don't you want to hear about the Xbox demo...?"
1,Just Dont Buy This,Yes Lucas is really sticking it to us. Yes Yes Yes. And I do not like it. But there is something you can do about it.I know many people who are complaining because they know they are going to buy it. Just don't. If you want to see a bad transfer of Solo shooting first with crappy sound just go rent it on video for a buck.use that money to start saving for the future high-def versions....
1,The extra disc,"I find it hilarious that the main selling point for this DVD is what is featured on the extra disc. Why else buy it? The speical edition is available in two other releases that came out in the past 2 years. Well, my dear Star Wars...to think it's come to this. RIP Star Wars."
1,LDs are cheaper,"When I heard about this release, I thought ""hey, now I have a reason to ditch my LD player and collection of movies"" but after reading that these movies are just a transfer, I think I'll keep my ancient Pioneer player. Not gonna pay 60+ bucks for things I already have."
1,Disappointed that the Theatrical cuts are non-anamorphic,"Well, I was going to pick these up to get the theatrical cut of each film in a widescreen release, but it looks like I will not now. It's really disappointing that they are non-anamorphic and since it seems to be inevitable that they will be re-released at some point with anamorphic transfers despite the fact that Lucas says otherwise. If I was still using a standard television set for my primary device to view DVDs, this would be fine for now I suppose, but having just purchased a widescreen television in January, non-anamorphic DVDs are not attractive to me at all.So a warning to all, if you don't know the difference between anamorphic and non-anamorphic DVDs and unless you don't mind buying these again to get anamorphic transfers in the future, I suggest you go do a search on the web to see for yourself what the difference is so that you can make a more informed purchase."
4,Finally!,"Thank goodness that Lucas is finally releasing the original and best versions of these movies. I couldn't stand the additions to Episodes IV-VI and so didn't buy them. I despaired of ever seeing my beloved films on DVD and resigned myself to watching my VCR versions for all eternity. Adding the enhanced versions is a little silly, but I'll take it as long I get what I want and the price for the 2 discs isn't outragous."
1,Stupid move,"Why in all the Star Wars Universe can I not have the original Star Wars Trilogy. You know 1977, ""Star Wars"", 1980 ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and 1983 ""Return Of The Jedi"". Not the ""kookie"" cartoon versions, but the real thing.I recieved the so called updated versions as a gift and I was beyond disappointed. They remain on my shelf only viewed once, and looked upon with disdain over how three very good movies were so butchered.With the number of fans begging for the ""Real Thing"", it would seem no one was indeed listening. So I will say this one more time ""May we please have the original version only in a Trilogy, not spread out the way they are now being marketed"".I guess in a few years we will see the genuine article when someone needs more cash. Shame on you George."
4,Some folks will never be happy.,"Some folks will never be happy. Lucas finally gives you what you want and all you can do is nit pick and groan and moan about it. This is it folks, either put up or shut up. You were crazy if you think Lucas was going to completely remaster a version of the film that he himself despises. Want anamorphic you have the 2004 cut. If not you can never again complain about Greedo shooting first. Lucas has given you what you wanted."
1,Get over it!,"Let me get right to the point. Star Wars is not a great movie. I think it's pretty stupid. Yes, I did see it and The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. And guess what? I wasn't impressed. Sure, the special effects were good, and the sound was very high tech. But ya know what? The acting is terrible. The plot was shallow. And there was no character identification. (Unless you somehow identify with people wanting to take over the universe.) This movie was an exploitation of special effects. I'm serious. If you took all the special effects out of the movie you would be left with trash. Take Titanic. It had wonderful special effects. If you took them out you still had a wonderful story with human emotions. Star Wars may be fun, but it's also a kiddie movie for adults who haven't yet grown up."
3,Transfer from 1993 Laserdisc..???? WTF..?????,"I spent $100 maybe 15 years ago for a letterboxed VHS set of the original trilogy. I threw out the second and third films unopened. ""A New Hope"" is the only good Star Wars movie.By this day and age, I own a rather spiffy HD television, and have ALWAYS preferred letterbox versions -- pan and scan is for housewives and little girls. Why isn't this DVD anamorphic widescreen..? Do you imagine that folks don't know what they want??I'll be saving my money on this little turkey. I can burn my own DVD from my own VHS copy of Chapter IV and watch that.One wonders what George Lucas had in mind releasing this version."
4,Mixed feelings,Don't get me wrong is great but if you going to release it with the original also don't edit jabba the hun human form scene and replace it with the jabba the monster look. Isn't the reason why there release the 2nd disc also to show you the original release and the redux release also.But besides that is still a must own collection.
3,This was the best of the series?,"I have to admit, the STAR WARS series are not my favorite movies of all time. I enjoy them, but they are still not my favorite. Of the series I like EMPIRE STRIKES BACK the best (it is the darkest story of the series, and that is what I like about it.) We are all entitled to our own opinioins, so people who do like these movies stop bad mouthing the people who don't, and the people who don't like them stop bad mouthing the people who do!"
2,Everyone likes the old movie better!!,"It's true. Just about everyone likes the old movie better, back when it was just called ""Star Wars."" I hate how I can say ""Star Wars"" now and some people have to ask ""Which Episode?"" It's freaking STAR WARS!!! It's not ""Episode IV: A New Hope,"" but STAR WARS, end title.If and only if you own this DVD release or the 2004 release, I invite you to use your internets to google the word ""Adywan."" You will be pleasantly surprised."
2,Why the complaints?,Well basically because we're being jipped from having 5.1 and the best image possible. instead we are getting a dated 2.0 audio track and no anamorphic.All we ask for is the improved sound track from the special edition release and the cleaned up footage!!! They already did it...we just want it minus the horrific additions Lucas made for his kids!-edit- ohhhh the agony!!! people have already ripped this on the internet and made it anamorphic themselves!!!!
2,poor workmanship,"Did Somebody Record from an old worn out Vhs tape off TV ?The 1977 Version was in better quality on the vhs thx release in the 90's Give it time and new formats and technology and we will be pushed to get the latest version. where are episodes 7,8,9 Lucas should have kept it going. over all 1,2,3 wernt that inportant. lucas could have used flashback sequences to inform us."
5,Classic,"The first movie in the original Star Wars trilogy, this is a solid, die-hard classic movie which was the beginning of one of the biggest franchises that the sci-fi world (or fiction in general) has ever known, and for good reason. This movie did a great job with the sci-fi aspects given that back then, computer technology was very, very, VERY limited compared to today, and yet they managed to pull it off for a great movie."
4,"Great movies, mostly good revisions","I've never been quite sure why so many people are complaining about the revisions to the original version of A New Hope. It's a great movie, but it came out in an era when people didn't have home video players (much less DVDs). Lucas cleaned up the movies, made the ships more realistic, and generally most of the improvements make the film look better. I agree that I wish Lucas didn't mess with the Greedo scene - I still believe Han shot first. However, that's relatively minor. Don't let that ruin the movie for you. I think overall you'll find yourself enjoying Star Wars all the more with this DVD version."
1,Like scraps to a starving dog,"When I found out he was releasing this I ritualistically burned the abomination version and returned it to the bowls of hell where it belonged. I just shelled out $50 for another set of the mutilated version, just to get a DVD version of the original version I only have on VHS (which I had a friend copy to DVD a while back for me because Mr. Lucas said he would never release these again)(What a prick). To make matters worse, the sound and picture are better on my bootleg copies from VHS than his shoddy ""bonus"". Let's face it, the man has taken our childhood, twisted it into something sub par, and made it harder to watch than a 9/11 documentary and then, as an after thought, thrown the original back in our faces, using the latest technology to make it look like crap, so he can make us believe that he has done us a favor by destroying what we so dearly loved as children."
1,"""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""","...there was a director who pioneered the ""space opera"" and revolutionized the way we see and hear films. In addition to these cinematic advances, he once claimed he was ""...very concerned about our national heritage, and I am very concerned that the films that I watched when I was young and the films that I watched throughout my life are preserved, so that my children can see them.""Yet, he messes with the OT and decides to release these ""fun"" versions as almost an FU to the fans of the OT. ""See? You wanted 'em, you got 'em. But, you're going to get 'em MY WAY"".Thanks, but no thanks.I've seen fans that hold your TRILOGY with more reverence than you do."
3,Yet to see a comic book!,"This is an elusive item, I have attempted to obtain the comic book limited edition DVD through this my 3rd attempt all via different sellers and even websites (this is my first attempt with an Amazon seller) and this is the third time I recieved an ordinary DVD that I can get locally for ten bucks w/o shipping costs to boot. I would contact your seller and be certain you are going to get this item as you expect to recieve it prior to ordering and save the cost of shipping losses.Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (Limited Original Comic Book Edition)"
1,Just buy the Laserdiscs..... C'mon ...enough is enough....,"I just bought the Laserdiscs of the original versions I remember from my childhood. $18.50 is all it cost me for all three movies from eBay.com. A good used laserdisc player cost me about $25... I suggest everyone who hasn't done so and wants these movies the way they should be, just do the same.You'll save money and you'll be able to sleep at night knowing that you haven't sent your money to Lucas again...enough is enough...."
1,"After all this time... thanks for nothing, George","All this time, all this waiting to get to see the original 1977 version on DVD, and what does George give us? Precisely what one would expect from an egomaniac like Lucas! A man who would like nothing better than to present the original version in the worst possible way gives us a non-anamorphic version with 2.0 sound. Thanks!That's right, it's letterboxed. I would suggest everyone who owns a widescreen TV to steer clear of this. The quality of the original version on this DVD (completely untouched from the looks of it) is about as good as the VHS version. In fact, it looks like they used the VHS version to create this DVD. Oh, the irony."
1,Don't Buy The Hype!,"This dvd release, which is marketing the inclusion of the original theatrical versions of the films as the ""big draw"", falls so miserably short in terms of video quality by even the most basic industry standard in 2006, that it is a disgrace.If you already own the special editions, steer clear of this blatant rip-off from LFL. There's no reason to buy these titles. The original versions will only look slightly better than VHS, and if you have a high-def tv, be prepared to break out your binocluars in order to watch these films in their correct, undistorted aspect ratios. Between the letterboxing AND the pillar boxing, so little of the screen will be dedicated to the picture that you won't even want to bother watching.Shame on LFL., and shame on Lucas. They owe the fans and the films that made LFL possible, infinitely more respect.Do Not Buy!"
1,You shouldn't be buying Full screen anyway,"And shame on THX for certifying a full screen release.The original versions being offered on a ""bonus"" disc is insulting. These will be non-enhanced for 16x9 Televisions and come from a 13 year old video transfer. This is like the stone-age! So much has advanced since that time. It's also insulting for people who have already purchased the special editions in 2004/2005 to be asked to re-buy them at a higher cost to receive these ""bonus"" discs of a classic film in a less than pristine form. LFL needs at a minimum make a new transfer or the original trilogy. Release this on dvd and then later on hd dvd or blu ray. If that it done, I don't have a problem with buying them again. Give these classics the respect they deserve! Until then I am done with Star Wars. See websites like digitalbits and hometheaterforum for more information."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on this NON ANAMORPHIC version,"Please note that the original version of these films are NON ANAMORPHIC. This means that they are using old transfers of the films which will be only slightly better (if that) than our VHS copies which we all bought when they were marketed as ""available for the last time."" Well, that proved to be a lie, and I am sure we will some day get a nice anamorphic High Definition transfer of the original versions. I wonder if everyone who bought the VHS versions that were advertised as being the last chance to get the original versions could file a class action lawsuit against Lucas??"
1,Don't even bother.,"Lucasfilm is not making any effort to make the unaltered, original versions of these films look, and sound any better, and they are making consumers who already purchased the previous 2004 releases, buy them again with this release. I say it is time for the consumer to stand up, and quit taking this type of treatment. Do not purchase these releases, unless Lucasfilm actually takes the time to make the unaltered, original versions of these films look, and sound, their best!"
1,too little too late,"sorry folks, nothing you want here.the 1977 version is not getting a decent digital transfer and will look like vhs compared to your 2004 version. i hope you will save your money and pick up that great new John Ford boxset instead... i did."
1,"LucasFilm's ""Official Response"" is 100% pure BS!","Typical corporate PR bull. Of course their official standpoint on the issue is that the original prints are not available. That way, in a few years, they will ""miraculously"" restore them and release them on whatever consumer format happens to be dominant at the time. Come on, LucasFilm is squeezing every penny they can out of a 30 year franchise. It is SO obvious their marketing BS stinks. I recognized that foul stench!"
1,Han shoots first...in stereo!,"Wow, George finally broke down and released the original Star Wars, the way they actually became groundbreaking films. Oh wait, those films were actually presented with quality in mind. What we have here is a transfer from the 1993 laserdisc collection. It's NOT in surround sound, it's NOT anamorphic, and it looks like something that was bootlegged back in the early nineties.Believe me, you are better off holding on to your hatred towards George Lucas. It's best not to waste your money on a crap product and then get really dissapointed.It's almost like George is trying to fool us into believing that the original versions are crap. If he dresses them up badly enough maybe we'll believe in his new found 'vision.'Please don't settle for these versions. They should go through the same effort they went through to clean up the films to create the 'special' editions."
1,Ancient video transfer = no sale,"The original versions being offered on a ""bonus"" disc is insulting. These will be non-enhanced for 16x9 Televisions and come from a 13 year old video transfer. This is like the stone-age! So much has advanced since that time. It's also insulting for people who have already purchased the special editions in 2004/2005 to be asked to re-buy them at a higher cost to receive these ""bonus"" discs of a classic film in a less than pristine form.

Give these classics the respect they deserve! Until then I am done with Star Wars. See websites like digitalbits and hometheaterforum for more information."
3,It could have been Anamorphic,"These movies should have been Anamorphic. The sound in 2.0 is fine. The letterboxed 4:3 is unacceptable. But, I bought it any way for 13.87 a copy at wally world. It was sad to find out these movies weren't released anamorphically. My copy of Close Encounters is!"
5,"INCREASE SPEED, FULL THROTTLE,","The best movie I have ever seen, especially the lightsabers. George is very creative."
3,The (enhanced) original version was better,"I love Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back and, to a lesser extent, Return of the Jedi. The digital enhancements to remove the lines around ships and generally brighten up the picture were great and that particular set of videos is definitely worth having, but these re-released versions, with new digital effects, that were shown in theatres look very much like a lazy, sloppy, half-hearted attempt to make even more money off the series. I look forward to Star Wars etc. being released on DVD, but I hope they use the remastered originals not these horrible, ugly hacks - they really put me off."
3,Worse than colorization,"The addition of a digitized Jabba the Hutt is indeed unfortunate. The whole over-dependence on computer-genrated effects is a disturbing trend. Am I the only one who sees that a smooth-skinned, slicked up version of Jabba is some how lacking what a slimy, leathery, so-real-you-can-smell-it Jabba can offer?True, the erasing of matte lines in the ship-to-ship combat sequences is great. And I, for one, liked seeing Luke talking with his childhood chum.But I would have liked it better if they included the Han Solo/Jabba scene just as it was shot. You know, Jabba as a filthy, grubby humanoid. Screw continuity. This is a piece of history. I, for one, like my history dirty, smelly, and real."
3,A film that speaks for itself,"This is one of those great movies that is almost beyond words, simply because it speaks for itself.The film has wonderful characters and great battles (this film introduced the lightsaber, which is one of the most famous and innovative weapons in movie history).While the dialogue and hairstyles look laughably dated, it doesn't matter. George Lucas created a brilliant story about good trying to overcome evil."
4,the 1977 soundtrack had 2 channels,"To the fool who said ""and make sure it has the original 5.1 SOUND"", theaters didn't HAVE Dolby 5.1 sound back in 1977. The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack IS the original soundtrack, the Dolby 5.1 version was created for the Special Edition. As advertised this disc contains the ""original theatrical movie version"" with the ORIGINAL 2-channel soundtrack.I'm just annoyed that I have to buy ANOTHER copy of the Stupid Edition to get the version I want..."
1,Deceived,"I was very disappointed in what was supposed to be the original 1977 theatrical release of Star Wars. The scenes I noted cut when this film was released again just prior to Empire were not put back in the film. For example, the scene where Luke watches the opening battle with his field glasses, the exchange between Luke and Biggs where Biggs informs him that he is leaving the academy to join the rebellion, and of course, the exchange between the gangsters (a.k.a. Jabba (pre-worm version)et al) and Solo in the docking bay.This is definitely not the version I watched in the summer of 1977."
4,Change can be good and bad,"Lucas (and ILM) did a fantastic job of improving the effects. I don't like some of the minor changes to the story line, but it's still star wars, one of the greatest movies ever."
1,Wrong item in box,The title should explain the low rating. The disk was sent promptly but it contained episode VI instead of IV. I returned the disk and was unable to obtain IV from this source.
4,One of THE BEST movies of all time -- of any genre.,"Yes, it's a space opera. Yes, it's at times corny. Yes, the effects are slightly dated. SO THE HECK WHAT! This film is escapist fare at its finest, and if you let yourself get into it, you WILL be transported to a galaxy far, far away. This original Star Wars movie -- unlike a certain modern prequel -- doesn't get so enamored with special effects and visuals that it loses sight of the characters. You truly come to care about Luke, Han, Leia, Obi-wan et al. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is that the movie does lose something on home video. NO television or even home theater system can EVER match the feeling of watching that Star Destroyer rumble overhead on the big screen."
5,"Not the best, but a great film","The original Star Wars was great in 1977, and is still great now. The Special Effects have withstood the test of time and are still enjoyed today, over 20 years later. Not the best film in the trilogy (Return of the Jedi) but still a great movie. If you haven't seen this movie I recommend it!"
2,Thanks y'all,"I would like to thank all of you who wrote the reviews of new hope on dvd. I almost got suckerd !!! I have been waiting for them to come out on dvd my vhs's are trashed. I can't believe it is not in wide screen what is the point. The thing I did not like about the last release was well to put in bluntly ""I DO NOT WANT TO SEE HAN SOLO'S BLUSHER OR OTHER MAKE-UP!!!"" in other words you can clean the picture just to muchThanks all of you cheers"
5,Yehaw,"If you have never heard, or saw anny of the star wars movies, you my friend...ARE AN IDEOT!!!No, realy. I think that just evreybody who has sceen the movie, would agrey with me. So, just buy it. You will see what I am talking about."
1,George lies - DON'T BUY,"If you are a true Star Wars fan, DON'T BUY THIS DVD!! We were told he was finally releasing the theatrical versions as well as the cleaned-up THX versions, but he has yet again duped us into buying the crappy Special Editions!! And you will not find the words ""Special Edition"" ANYWHERE on the packaging! This is an outrage. I knew he would never give us what we really wanted. Once a film becomes so loved it doesn't belong to you anymore, George. You have managed to alienate your fans yet again, but still get their money. Enough is enough."
2,Lame and obvious,There are many other science fiction films and television series that are much better than this infantile offering.Only for the concept of THE FORCE and for the special effects can this film even rate 2 stars.
1,One big Yawn,"Twenty-three years later I am still bored to death whenever I sit down to watch this film and see what all the fuss is about. Some films over the years have at least started to grow on me, but ""Star Wars"" never has, and probably never will. I'm a Harrison Ford fan and I like just about every movie he's ever made, but even the Ford can't do much for ""Star Wars"" in my opinion. Cute robots? Oh, brother."
2,$76.78? Are You Kidding Me?,"Are these discs made out of gold and platinum? How could one movie ever be worth this much, especially nowadays. I can see buy the the trilogy for that much, but for just one episode? This just blows my mind. No wonder there's so many pirated copies online. Who's gonna spend close to $300 just to get the origial trilogy in their collection?I can buy the original TRILOGY, enhanced and originals in widescreen, for $35!Am I missing something?"
4,What a tease,"Oh how George Lucas teases us Star Wars fans, for years we've been waiting for a re-release of the theatrical version of our beloved Star Wars and finally our prayers have been answered... kind of. The original version is more of an afterthought on this DVD set. I would have loved for Lucas to have treated the original with the respect that we the star wars fans would have shown in, instead of slapping it onto the 2nd disc of a DVD set.But i digress, i bought this the first day it came out, and if he releases another version i'll buy that too. but do yourself a favor, if you have kids who've never seen Star Wars before, or you somehow have never seen it, this is the edition to buy...and make sure you watch the theatrical version first, you'll finally understand what us Star Wars fans mean when we say that Han shot first!"
1,This set does no justice to the original films!,"Caveat Emptor! Buyer Beware! Don't go thinking you're going to get a great transfer of the original Star Wars films, because these DVDs contain nothing but shoddy Laderdisc rips that were created in 1993.Is it too much to ask for George ""Moneybags"" Lucas to just release the original films the way there were originally shown in anamorphic widescreen? We fans are not asking for a massive digital restoration, just an anamorphic widescreen presentation!Simply amazing that awful films such as ""Ishtar"" get released in anamorphic widescreen, while the greatest Sci-Fi films of all time get a slapdash, no-effort release.I understand that George wants to force-feed (no pun intended) the terrible 2004 special editions down our throats, but this DVD release is as low as it gets. Boycott this release!"
1,Why would anyone buy this?,"This is a rehash of the 2004 SE's (of which I will never buy because they have been bastardized from the original). You can get it cheaper by buying the '04 SE box set rather than these separately. But wait, as a bonus you get the unaltered original Star Wars. Well true but you are getting it with inferior quality as they are not anamorphic releases. STAY AWAY AT ALL COST FROM THIS RELEASE!!!! Do not spend your hard earned money on inferior quality and if you prefer the SE, get the box set instead."
2,Original Version NOT 16x9 Enhanced,"Sorry, but that's the deal breaker for me. I only wanted this set because it would have the ORIGINAL film on DVD. But this release of the original will not be enhanced for widescreen TVs. Bad decision by LucasFilm, and I can't support this type of half-hearted release of the originals on DVD."
1,Not Buying,"To market these as being able to get the originals, when the real deal is georgie boy is just trying to make more money off his ""special edition"". This extra disc with the original in crappy format is the bait. Don't take it. Lucas films has never released bonus material as these are being labeled in Non-animorphic format. If you own the laserdisc this will be no better as that is where this is being sourced. This yeilds about 30% less resolution then an animorphic (or enhanced for 16x9) transfer would and will look like bad in comparison even on a 4:3 TV. These aren't the discs your looking for. Move along."
1,Star Wars: A No Hope,"INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- CORRIDORThe angry Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted DVDs of 2004 versions of Star Wars.IMPERIAL OFFICER: The new version is only a poor copy of the laserdisk, and it's only provided as a special feature.Vader squeezes the neck of George Lucas, who struggles in vain.VADER: Where is the original film? What have you done with the 1977 theatrical release?Vader lifts General Lucas off his feet by his throat.VADER: What have you done with the anamorphic widescreen?LUCAS: The original negative is in too bad a shape to make a better copy.VADER: If the original is in such bad condition, how did you make the 2004 edit version?The Dark Lord begins to squeeze the producer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until Lucas goes limp.VADER: Commander, tear LucasFilm apart until we have a true version, and make sure it has the original 5.1 SOUND!!"
1,Move along. These aren't the DVDs you're looking for.,"If you love the original Star Wars trilogy as much as me, it is time to send a loud and clear message to Lucas that you will not endorse a subpar, inferior product. Do not get too excited when you pop this DVD into your player to watch on a widescreen TV. The 1977 version will appear as a tiny, low-resolution image. It is a non-anamorphic transfer (which in 2006 is NOT an industry standard), so it is NOT enhanced for 16x9 viewing. Get ready to enjoy Star Wars like you never have before - as if you were watching it through a mail slot!!!Boycott this DVD until Lucasfilm acknowledges and corrects this. This trilogy's most loyal fans deserve better."
1,Why you should not buy this title.,"1) You've already bought this movie several times, and probably have the 2004 DVD editions. You are being forced to buy the 2004 edition AGAIN just to buy the original theatrical version.and2) This DVD will not be enhanced for widescreen TVs which means if you have a widescreen TV you will have black bars around ALL FOUR SIDES of the screen. Even if you don't have a widescreen TV, the picture quality will be very poor, transfered from a 1993 release.Do not buy this title."
1,Will not buy. Poor release.,Don't waste your money on this release. The 1977 versions are non-anamorphic. Anything else in the set can be purchased cheaper through the boxed set. Let lucas know this shoddy release is unacceptable by not buying it.
3,Over hyped and overrated,"You have to face facts, this movie simply isn't THAT GOOD. Sure, it's fun, it has blasters and fights, but there is no substance. The story is cliched and rather predictable, the characters are amusing but incredibly simplistic. We like it because it's a fantastic tale of knights, damsels, and the evil king, and it tickles our imagination. It is not at all intelligent, in fact it is infantilizing and probably set the movie industry back years as they realized people will buy flash and cliche with the lack of a story. If it weren't for that fact, it would not even garner 3 stars."
5,"This made a ""Star Wars"" fan very happy!","This dvd made a great gift! I gave it to my boyfriend who's a big ""Star Wars"" fan. The only likes the original versions, so this made the perfect gift. He was so happy to finally be able to watch the original "" Star Wars"" movies on our flat screen tv in widescreen format."
1,Another one-star for emphasis,"One of these days, the contract Lucas signed with Satan will come due and whoever is left in charge will finally give these movies a proper home video release. Until that happy day arrives, I suggest you skip this craptastic retread and give your money to a filmmaker who actually appreciates their fans. (That would be almost anyone not named ""George Lucas"")"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character ""Biggs"" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!!Moral: Don't waste your money!"
1,Not Buying,"If the films were cleaned up ie The Special Editions, and restored to today's technological standards then yes, I'd absolutely have to run out and buy the set. But I'm not about to invest in an outdated version/1993 laserdisc transfer of one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time. There are simply too many Star Wars fans who prefer the theatrical films to the updated ones and releasing a quality DVD of the Original Trilogy shouldn't prove to be this much of a problem."
1,"Original versions as ""bonus material""? Horrible... No Thanks.","I'm happy with my Star Wars trilogy Special Letterbox Collector's Edition from 1992 on VHS. It has the true original releases in widescreen, just like it was in theatres. What more do I need?Why would I buy yet ANOTHER version of the ""Special Editions""? What a waste. I'll just deal with VHS format. Who cares. With all the rendering Lucas has done with his 400 different releases of the film, I wouldn't even be surprised if he ""fixed"" parts of the so called 'original versions' on the DVDs.If you really want to sit down and watch these movies as they are supposed to be, play it safe, buy the original trilogy on vhs BEFORE Lucas got it into his head to change everything.All the new renditions over the years has turned these filmed into a wish washed mess.George Lucas is an idiot."
5,What ORIGINAL Star Wars Fans Wanted All Along,"This review is for all ORIGINAL Star Wars fans (I was 14 when it was released). This is what WE have wanted all along. The original Star Wars movie we saw in 1977 (no ""Episode IV - A New Hope"" in the crawler - never thought I'd get to see that again). This is the untampered with version, no computer generated alterations to the visuals and storyline, no special sound, no special format, but ALL THE ORIGINAL FUN!!! The quality of the DVD is actually quite good. Much better than your old VHS versions you've worn out. Take it from ""one of you""...you WILL love this DVD. (Those who hate this DVD are the ones who think it's cool that a young Anakin replaced the old Anakin in the ""special edition"" of ROTJ...unbelievable!). And by the way...get it right once and for all people...the argument isn't ""Han shot first"", the truth is ""Greedo never shot""."
2,Not for me,"If I knew this was the the only way ever I could buy the original 3 films as released in the cinema I would buy these discs.I've just borrowed this one from a friend and the original version on disc 2 is in 2.35 - 1 letterbox (no problem with that) but not anamorphic (why?). This means those of us who own widescreen TV's have to either watch a tiny image to get the best quality picture or zoom it out and lose quality. No thanks I'll take the chance and wait.The quality of the disc 2 original is OK, but you need to know that the picture is not anamorphic. What this means in simple terms is that on a widescreen TV you get black bars top and bottom as well as right and left, unless you use your TV's zoom option.Next year is the 30th anniversary and George Lucas may do us all a favour next year and release the originals as they were supposed to be seen."
5,GEORGE LUCAS IS A GENIUS (DUH!),"Buy it. Rent it. Borrow it. This movie should become an integral part of everyone's life (just like eating and sleeping and shopping at Amazon.com) If you've never seen it don't be ashamed. There are about 4.98142 billion people who haven't (give or take a ""few""!) Watch it. Become a part of the Force today!"
5,The special edition redefines the vision of george lucas .,"It is only fitting for the man who reinvented Special effects with Star wars to come back and reinvent the effects with the above mentioned film after 20 years. The scene with jabba just goes to show that we are fast approaching an era when films would cease to be a linear experience. pretty soon we will be watching "" THE REVENGE OF BRUCE LEE "" with the lead actor ,a digital construct. Mr. Lucas go forth and multiply !"
5,Jedi,"If you don't like this you are insane. How could you not love the adventure, the blasters, and the lightsabers"
1,Don't BOTHER!!!!!!!!,"How DARE he!!! This is like a slap in the face! George should be ashamed, and not just for the crappy episodes I, II, & III. No animorphic in the original editions of episodes IV, V, & VI? Oh, sure, here's the movies that made George a mint, that are considered cinematic history, and they're not in the best condition they should be??? The print is simply awful! And to have it in 4:3 widescreen is unforgivable! I swear, I can hear him laughing as I put the disc in, and cackling as I put down another 60 bucks...buying movies I already own!!! Shame on you, George Lucas! Shame on you. And shame on me for EVER falling in love with this series. It's over. George is officially a lunatic."
3,"A nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.","Star Wars is a fun movie, that's all, not a great cinematic accomplishment. The editing wasn't that great, the special effects were good at the time, the script didn't make much sense, the plot was full of holes, etc. But for what it was, a loud, fun moive with a pretty cast, lots of battle scenes and a sprinkling of romance, it was one of the best. However, something can be said for substance and technical perfection, but, please do not let George Lucas be the one to say it."
5,Classic Space Cowboys,Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers entertained in the 1930's: comic book heroes come to life on the screen. In Star Wars we have what is really a fantasy with science fiction trappings. It is a children's story that we all find a deeper meaning in. When is good is really so good and bad is really so bad... it is a western set in a place far away with a Zen sub-theme.
4,"There's a reason why it's a ""Classic""","I've been watching Star Wars since before I can remember, and I've yet to grow tired of it. The Special Edition makes it all the better. It's a classic sci-fi fairy tale which is so memorable it is easy to ignore the few flaws it has. If you haven't seen this, what's wrong with you? This is a must see and a must own."
5,Best Movies Ever,"This trilogy is the best set of movies, I have ever watched. Though I was not around to see them in the theaters when they were first released, I first saew them in the midst of big Hollywood productions, and they were a escape from all the hollywood crap we now get. The Special Edition isn't really better than the original, but any diehard fan, has to have this."
5,Star Wars rocks,I have seen this movie more than 10 times and I still don't get bored of it. Star Wars is the best movie I have ever seen.
1,Save your money!,"This one is the ultimate ""You've gotta be kidding me!"" They finally offer the theatrical versions on DVD and they're LETTERBOXED?!?! I mean, after all, the digitally enhanced version is ""nice"", but when the Death Star explodes in the climactic scene, the new version just looks wrong. All of a sudden I'm worried about the digitally enhanced version of the original Star Trek that premieres in my area tomorrow...Thanks, George, for yanking my chain on this one. Should I ever have the opportunity to meet you, I'll be certain to ask for my refund in person."
3,I could be better,"I last I got both the original version and the special edition on DVD. Somthing I dislike of this version of the lack of special features in both disc. Other thing, for Latin American customers, I regret that both DVD don't have Spanish Subtitles, so we have no choice but heard both version in Spanish. The Original version have dubbed on Spanish from Spain(no popular in latin american people) and the Special Edition is dubbed in Spain from Mexico.I have never the idea of Lucas to change one more his original trilogy of Star Wars. He neither change the dialogue between the Emperador and Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, nor replaced Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker by Hayden Christensen in The Return of the Jedi. May the Force With You Always"
2,My laser disks look better than this,"Very disappointed - my old laser disks look better than the movies on the bonus disks. The bootleg DVDs I purchased years ago that were burned from the laser disks look better than the movies on the bonus disks. Kinda shocking, actually, because I can't figure out how that happened! Re the non-anamorphic transfers, I am not personally disturbed because I do not own a HDTV. Still, for those who do, and since I might purchase a HDTV in the future, it is more than very disappointing that Lucasfilm didn't spend the approximately $100,000 it would have cost to do anamorphic transfers so that the films would fill up the widescreen without distortion or loss of picture quality. I'm not concerned about the Dolby 2.0 because, as has been noted, that's what was available when the films came out. If Lucasfilm had just done the anamorphic transfer and made sure that the films were no worse than the old laserdisks, I would have been happy. But unfortunately, I am not happy."
1,How George Lucas killed Star Wars,"I could write so much on this subject... I'll just stick with the review of this new DVD.YOU DON'T RELEASE A MOVIE IN 4:3 LETTERBOX IN THIS DAY AND AGE! George Lucas was the one pushing for all-digital theatres and all that. And now he disrespects the work of all the people that helped him make Star Wars a success in the first place back in 1977.I bought a DVD player originally so that I would own the original Star Wars on DVD. I got an HDTV compatible widescreen TV to see it in at least standard 16x9 anamorphic resolution. (like 94 % of big movie DVD`s out there..)Now I realise.. After all those years of waiting, George Lucas is sooooo thick... He just WON'T give fans what THEY really want... All those people who made him rich.Go to hell, George Lucas. You have lost my admiration for good."
5,Accept No Substitutes!,"When this movie first appeared, I didn't want to see it. The lines were too long, it sounded silly, etc., etc. When I finally got dragged to the theatre, I was wowed. I went back again and again, and if there was only one movie I could save, this would be it. Not because it is good at any one particular thing, but because it is the complete entertaining movie. It dazzles and awes, especially considering it was made over 20 years ago. I always wanted to be the Hans Solo character but my friends told me I was more like Luke Skywalker... at least it was better than my other friend who was likened to R2D2. Anyway, this is the greatest of the triolgy, the greatest sci-fi, the one I'd take with me to the island."
3,BEWARE! LATIN AMERICAN,"The sound and sub in trilogy, has. . .Subtitule: In Spanish only in the opening scroll and them nothing moreAudio: Spanish from SPAIN is TEERRIIIBLEEE!!!, the ORIGINAL but. . .TEERRIIIBLEEE!!! i prefiered the LATIN AMERICAN AudioMaybe George Lucas check this problem with the product it's self, i was think. . .when buyed, the two disk set have the subtitule and the audio in SPANISH."
5,Star Wars 4 A New Hope,This was a very nice dvd. It was very interesting to watch. Like the star wars series.
3,35%,This rocks! It's pretty goood. The lightsabers in the theater version look like the ones in I II III.The explosion of Alderaan & the death star looks false though.The enhanced version is barely different to the originals.
5,At LAST!,"Finally good 'old' Star Wars on DVD! With the original crawl, matte lines and REAL models! This film and it's sequals required artistry, not just programming skill.Some people have complained about the DOLBY STEREO isn't digital... They didn't have digital surround sound in the 70s and 80s!Changing films after they are released is just as bad as colorizing films... Just because something looks better (and sounds better) doesn't make it better.I thought the burning of Atlanta at the end of GONE WITH THE WIND was too short. It was shot too close, so you can't see enough of Atlanta. Why not add another twenty minutes with nice CGI buildings and slowly pull in to the original footage... That would be cool!Why is that wrong? It is a film classic. It was a huge hit years ago because it was well done... Why change it?"
5,This movie is great beyond belief.,"This movie is a lot better than any Star Trek movie would ever be and this isn't even the best one.I think it is cool that George Lucas released this one first so you will have to wait to find out who Ben Kanobi is and who Leia really is and how Luke came to be.All the charecters are great in this movie as well, my favorite is Han Solo.This movie has a great story line and I like how all the charecters are developed and I love all the vilians like Darth Vador and all the Stormtroopers.It's just awesome.This plot turns all different turns and I'm not saying that in a bad way, it actually makes sence.I would tell you to buy this off amazon but you could also buy the trilogy, you could see my reviews for them.I reccomend this movie."
2,Boring and two dimensional,"After a slooow buildup with some boring discussion about the force etc, we get to the bar scene, which is great. But it shows you that the movie really needs Harrison Ford and probably not Mark Hammil. Good special effects and mix of fantasy and science fiction (with some biblical references easy for a preacher's son like to me recognize). Lightsabers are an interesting weapon for fighting. I think Obi Wan Kenobi was a more important character to this movie than Luke Skywalker, who's kind of a dorky farm boy. I know what I'm talking about doesn't really have anything to do with anything, but bear with me. The characters are kind of black and white--either totally good or totally bad--except for Han Solo who was a smuggler or something. He's still my favorite character until Liam Neeson joined the party. And for goodness sake (to the junkies who waited in line to be the first to see the Phantom Menace) it's just a movie!"
5,Finally the originally is coming!!!,Amazing how the print was found of the original version of the film after 1) the jazzed up one was released on DVD not too long ago and 2) now that there are newer technologies being released such as HD-DVD/Blu-ray that provide even better picture resolution.I'll buy it since my unaltered version is on LaserDisc but I'm not happy to be shelling out more money for something that should have been released in the boxed set previously.
4,Give Me Episode IV,"I'm going to buy the original version of episode IV, because I don't like the changes Lucas made. I know I'm in the minority here, but the changes to episode V and VI made those films better. I'm just as frustrated as everyone else with the way Lucas keeps dangling different versions in front us. I'm not going to buy any of the films again after this."
1,I've Reached My Limit,Its not 16:9. Its not in 5.1 Surround Sound. The very reasons we've all been waiting for the Uncut original version for a DVD release.Lucas has the right to do what he wants with his movies. He's the creator. But I can only buy these movie so many times. He stated on the back of my VHS set that the original versions will never appear in another video release again. Guess not. I've got the latest version of the Trilogy on DVD and for now that's good enough. I'll buy the Original Versions when it finally comes in 16:9 or HD/Blue Ray. Lucas can make money if he releases them in the latest format. He's now done it and he'll do it again. So as a consumer I'll exercise my right not to buy yet another copy.And if Lucas never does. Whatever.
1,Untitled,"I don't care about the audio. I don't care about the ugly packaging. I just hate that the print wasn't cleaned up. I just hate that the film isn't presented in true anamorphic widescreen. Get yourself a Netflix subscription, rent this, and burn a copy. Burn copies for all your friends. Lucas hates piracy, but I hate Lucas."
3,NOT a new xfer,"For all those complaining of the poor-quality non-anamorphic film transfer of this release, realize that LucasFilm dind't just turn the telecine machine to 'craptastic' and hit record for a sub-par transfer. This is an older transfer from the 1993 Laserdisc masters.I too am unimpressed. Lots of details are available at the OriginalTrilogy website."
3,"Inferior release of the original, but still very watchable","The ""Special Edition"" of Star Wars looks great. The original theatrical release included on the ""bonus disk"" is perfectly watchable but sadly it did not get the treatment it deserved. I have the 1993 remastered edition on VHS that was marketed as ""The original trilogy one last time, (LOL!) and this DVD does look better than my old VHS. To sum up: 5 star movie, minus one star for the sub par release of the original and minus another star for making me buy the ""Special Edition"" to get it."
1,"Sell-out. I'm a 30-year fan, and this is a sellout.","C'mon George, we all own these movies, we love them, and have vowed to pass them onto our children - do you have to dirty it with these one'sy-two'sy ""box sets"" every couple/few years? You have gaming and toy royalties, why smudge the Star Wars legacy with sellout moves like this?! I love your work, I've spent my entire life emersed in it, but this has gone too far..."
1,Bonus disc? Lucas are you smoking the chronic???????,"This ""bonus disc"" is a sad example of how screwed up Lucas has become. The original Star Wars is not even worth a new transfer to DVD? It's non-anamorpic to boot. I suggest you skip this release and look for a bootleg, which is pretty much what this is. Hey Luke, you didn't get any money from me for the 2004 box set and you are not getting it now. BOOM"
1,Creator and destroyer of Star Wars,"Lucas is once again showing his contempt for the greatest movies of all time and his disrespect for the fans that made him rich.He is trying to erase these classic films in favour of his constantly revised CGI, slapstick versions. He thinks by fobbing us off with inferior transfers he can achieve this.Please don't buy them. We all deserve better.Lucas will likely still be smugly laughing all the way to the bank but we need to stand up for the classics - classics that deserve a proper release.The covers are awful too."
2,"Uh, duh Georgie","I'll let you know off the bat, I'm one of the fools who bought the re-cut trilogy on DVD from two years ago. I decided the changes didn't bother me too much, as long as Lucasfilm eventually released the originals on DVD as well. Well, now they are, except they're releasing them with the 2004 re-cuts that I, along with many others, already have. This is just a poor business decision. Remember back in 1997 when they rereleased these movies in theatres as ""Special Editions"" with new scenes, sound, and FX? Technically, there are three versions of each film: The original, 1997, and 2004. All they had to do was couple the originals with the 1997 special editions, then we would have all three versions to compare and contrast. That's it. No money wasted, all products exploited, and everyone's a happy customer. It's not brain surgery guys."
1,Luca$ Should Be Ashamed!,"Cost of ANH - $10,000,000Cost of ESB - $25,000,000Exacting revenge against OT fans who didn't cop to the PT and SE's - Priceless"
3,Original 1977 Version not optimized for 16:9 televisions,"I was very excited when I put the second disc of this set into my DVD player. My excitement immediately turned to disappointment when I noticed that the original version of the film was not optimized for widescreen televisions, meaning that there were black bars on the sides and the top and bottom of the picture. To span the width of the screen you have to use the zoom feature of your television resulting in a subpar image. Why is the second disc not optimized for 16:9 televisions, when the first disc is? I will still give it three stars because it is better than not having it at all I guess."
5,Even better,"I've never been quite sure why so many people are complaining about the revisions to the original version of A New Hope. It's a great movie, but it came out in an era when people didn't have home video players (much less DVDs). Lucas cleaned up the movies, made the ships more realistic, and generally most of the improvements make the film look better. I agree that I wish Lucas didn't mess with the Greedo scene - I still believe Han shot first. However, that's relatively minor. Don't let that ruin the movie for you. I think overall you'll find yourself enjoying Star Wars all the more with this DVD version."
5,The Best of the Crystals,"This has got to be one of the best recordings of the Crystals' original best sellers. One of added benefits is the CD liner which tells the story of the group and the three lead vocalists: La La Brooks, Barbara Alston , and of course, Darlene Love. Each song features the year recorded, the writers, the producers, and who of the three leading ladies sang the lead. My favorites include: ""Uptown"" a long forgotten greatest hit no longer on the Oldies stations play list, ""He's A Rebel"", ""He's Sure the Boy I Love"", ""Da Doo Ron Ron"", and ""Then He Kissed Me"" This is a definate ""buy 2"" CD."
5,A great album!,"Here it is, a collection of all the big hits the Crystals had. All the hits are here including ""Da Doo Ron Ron"", He's A Rebel"", ""He Hit Me"" and ""Then He Kissed Me"". Also notable are the 1961 ""There's No Other Like My Baby"" and ""He's Sure the Boy I Love"". This is a great album with wonderful vocals from all the lead singers. This is also a good album to buy if you like or are just discovering the Crystals, girl groups or the ""wall of sound"". If you like this one be sure to purchase the Best of the Ronettes."
4,"Wonderful collection from one of the original ""Girl Groups""","The Crystals' musical lifetime was relatively short but, alongwith another female group, the Ronettes, they were a major influence on the best of all the girl groups, the Supremes.The Crystals had only three major hits. ""Da Doo Ron Ron"" and ""Then He Kissed Me"" are very hard to find and their biggest, ""He's a Rebel"", is nearly impossible to locate. For that reason alone, this album is worth having. Happily, all three cuts are originals and nicely remastered.There is very little in the way of secondary material on this disc but, with the three big hits already mentioned, who needs any? The Best of the Crystals is an excellent addition to any rock'n'roll collection."
2,NOT digital remastering,"It plainly states on MY copy of this CD that Phil Spector chose to master this in analog, NO digital remastering. That is why the sound quality is so VERY poor for the beauty and power of these songs and this artist group, and Phil's own powerful production! His choice, not ABCKO.Walt Schultz"
3,Disappointed,"As an audiophile, I expected at least a few tracks to be ""STEREO"" but once I realized which company released the CD, I knew I wouldn't be pleased. All Mono All the time with the company who released this CD.The quality is passable but nothing to write home about.If all you care about is the sound, you might like this CD but be forewarned, it's not necessarily as advertised."
4,ANOTHER FUN GIRL GROUP OF THE SIXTIES,"THE SUPREMES and THE RONETTES were perhaps bigger, but the CRYSTALS were standing right beside them ,with hits like DA DOO RUN RUN and GIRLS CAN TELL.BARBARA ALSTON was the most beautiful girl singer of the sixties.This collection has all the good stuff and only a few duds, that don't matter too much.Another cd that will be near you when you need a little boost.I can stand hours looking at BARBARA's face.Am i crazy or just in love?Let's notforget DARLENE and her hard driving voice and LA LA too."
4,Classic hits from Phil Spector,"Excellent CD...if there were a list of classic rock n' roll lyrics, ""I met him on a Monday and my heart stood still..."" from Da Doo Run Run would be on it. Be sure to catch Then He Kissed Me, which is used in a marvelous 2 minute segement of the movie 'Goodfellas'. Shame that it wasn't put on the movie's soundtrack!"
1,Poorly designed,"Does what it's supposed to and very easy to set-up, but falls apart constantly. It would be hard to imagine a worse design."
1,A COMPLETE JUNK!!!,Bought it today and it is already broken. Poor design and too fragile. I am currently using a rubberband to hold the flap together. Don't buy!!!!!!!!!
1,Flimsy connector,"The connector isn't robust. It popped apart the first day I used it. The latch pops up and you plug the network cable into a flat but hollow connector. It should be more like a sleeve so that the entire RJ-45 clip is surrounded and secure. I'm planning to return the adapter, unhappy that I spent so much on overnight postage."
1,Too fragile,"I am shopping now to replace this. Having had success with other Linksys products, I stuck with this brand when I needed a USB network adaptor. The hinged door into which the network cable fits broke not long after purchase, rendering this product useless."
1,Horrible product,"I bought this product for my Tivo and it broke within a few weeks. As other reviewers have said, the RJ45 connector is incredibly fragile and it's really not a question of if it will break but when. I recommend the Netgear FA120 instead. Instead of a flimsy flip-up, you plug the Cat-5 directly into a sturdy box, and it puts less pressure on the Tivo's USB port. How a big company like Linksys, with all it's money and brainpower, delivers such an obviously inferior product is beyond me."
1,very flimsy,"the good news is it worked with no problem. The bad news, it's a very flimsy design and it got knocked and broke about 10 days after I bought it. Definitely not recommended!"
1,Worst design ever,"This has to be the most poorly designed device I've seen with the Linksys brand on it. It's beyond me why they couldn't do with the tried and true RJ45 socket design. Instead, the little door flips up, and the ethernet plug goes in at an angle, and the door is supposed to catch the plug hook to keep the cable in place. The door is held at the right height by tiny plastic rods that fall out if you look at them funny and good luck finding them if they do fall out. Which they will. The ethernet plug has to go at the exact right angle or it won't stay. And if both of those plastic rods fall out -- which they will -- you're going to have to wrap wrap some tape around that door to keep it at the right position. This is not the sort of thing you expect to need to do after paying $80 for a two-inch-long device! Has to be the poorest physical design for a network device I've seen, ever."
4,Easy to use,Needed this for my OLPC. Worked out of the box with no drivers needed.NOTE: works great with USB hub layout.
4,Speed limited to 12Mbps,"Although this device is a very nifty idea, since this device is only written to the USB 1.1 standard, its top transfer speed will be 12Mbps, which is will only give you 2Mbps more throughput when connected to a 100Mbps network, so beware of that. If it was USB 2.0, then it could more than handle the 100Mbps speed."
3,Way too sensitive,"I picked one of these up to serve as the network adapter for my Tivo. It worked right out of the box with no problems, but the connector is just way too sensitive. If the network cable gets moved in any way, the connection is lost. Very annoying.I'm sure this is a very handy product for some applications, but for more permanent setups I would sooner choose a larger, more stable network adapter."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"As others have noticed, fragile design. I broke it, and I was being gentle. Had to replace it with same model, though, since USB to Ethernet adaptors are not easy to come by (TiVo, thanks a lot for making customers go through this).I long for TiVo's next generation, when I hope they'll have an ethernet plug in the back.If you're stuck getting this one, like me, be *extremely* careful plugging it in."
2,Beware the flimsy construction,"This product works fine as long as you do not wiggle the ethernet cord. Too much wiggle, and the ethernet cord will pop out, along with breaking the little door that holds the RJ-45 connector on. It is *impossible* to fix.Another reason not to like this product is that it is USB 1.x, and not USB 2.x. This is OK if you are only working on a 10Mbps (Mega bit per second) ethernet; but most people are now going to 100Mbps (and some to 1000Mbps) where USB1.x is totally antique. USB2.x at least has the speed to work with a viable 100Mbps network.Having had to replace TWO of these because of the top reason, I cannot recommend this unless you have your PC/Tivo/whatever bolted down, or rack mounted."
2,Terrible Packaging,"I received this item as a gift and had to return it due to the plates being broken. The replacement was sent, but the plates in the replacement were broken. So I ordered another set that arrived broken. Until the packaging changes, I would recommend choosing a different brand."
4,I really like these,"These are really beautiful dishes - just a couple of cons -1. They show scratches after only a year of use2. The dinner plates are too large for my dishwasher. My water comes out of a jet below the top rack and can't spin when these are on the bottom rack. If you don't have a similar set up, you should be fine."
5,Perfect,"Cups and bowls are huge. Charcoal, black, and ivory work perfectly with the black granite in my kitchen. Dishwasher, freezer, microwave. These are exactly what I needed. The accessories....big plate, vegetable bowl, salt and pepper shakers...you can get other accessories too. Heavy quality Pfaltzgraff."
3,"Nice dinnerware, but the packaging is inadequate...","I should have listened to the previous reviewers. My order arrived with the set in a Pfaltzgraff box, placed in a larger box. The larger box showed obvious signs of rough handling (was falling apart at the seams, really. The deliverer was UPS ground...) Even though the space in between the two boxes was liberally filled with bubble wrap, the Pfaltzgraff box itself does not protect the contents from shock. So, one of the plates and one of the mugs arrived broken. This would not be amazon's fault, but until Pfaltzgraff improves its packaging, I would suggest you think twice before buying a Pfaltzgraff product and have it delivered by mail. Kudos to amazon, though. They are replacing the set, no questions asked."
5,More From the Crypt!,"Very well written episodes that still are kinda freaky. The best of the two is the first about two teen girls who believe there may be a vampire on the loss in their fair city. This episode is great, worthy of the adult series ""Tales from the Crypt"". The second episode is great that has the classic ""Crypt"" twist at the end. Good stuff."
1,The end of a fan,"I loved these three original films and had to endure three of the worst films, or so called back stories to these classics. Yet another strike comes to multiple re-release after re-release of substandard remasters of the three great originals. Lucas, the one time great filmaker is found guilty of greed and he has turned his back on the fans that once followed his every move with great loyalty. Now all that are left are these small brained people that are turned on by any piece of crap flashing in front of their eyes. Go ahead and buy this if you want, I've decided to take any copies of these films I own and find some sucker on e-bay to buy them."
5,Pretty good but Empire is still best,"ROTJ was a great movie and i dont think it deserves five stars but instead 4 and 1/2. There's just something about it that makes it not as superior as The Empire Strikes Back. Maybe its the ewoks, the many similarities to Star Wars: A New Hope or maybe its the fact that while Jedi is cool, its doesnt have nearly the amount of coolness that Empire had. Return of The Jedi is still a great flick and a pretty good conclusion to the trilogy but Empire is still best. Hands down."
3,A thrilling everyday sci-fi adventure,"The plot was nothing to write home about: I mean, this purely evil emperor who's battling the all-good rebellion. Some of the trilogy was unrealistic, especially the villians. I would have made the villians more normal-looking(maybe good-looking). Oh, and there was such a dearth of female characters...when will they catch up to Star Trek the Next Generation? One character I did like was Luke Skywalker...because he was a non-stereotype in a lot of ways. He was the free-est, most human of all the characters. He was not always composed and macho, and often showed fear. Few people realized that when he was entering Jabba's cave, he was shaking inside!"
1,I know where U can get Originals,"These dvd's are a joke. If you want the ORIGINAL full length movies on dvd go on ebay. You will find versions copied from LASERDISC. They are in widescreen, digital quality, original audio and full length. They are superior to the old VHS Copies and much better then these new Dvd's.Viva la revolution.........."
1,Lazy Release,"This is just a lazy effort on the part of Lucas Film. I have loved these films since I was a kid. I just can not bare to watch the new enhanced verions of these films. Try watching the originals it is not just that Han shoot first, he is the only one who shoots! Lucas can do what ever he wants to these films, but please give us a reasonable quality version of the OT (anamorphic)."
3,"Inferior release of the original, but still very watchable","The ""Special Edition"" of Return of the Jedi looks great in this release. The original theatrical release included on the ""bonus disk"" is perfectly watchable but sadly it did not get the treatment it deserved. I have the 1993 remastered edition on VHS that was marketed as ""The original trilogy one last time, (LOL!) and this DVD does look better than my old VHS. To sum up: 5 star movie, minus one star for the sub par release of the original and minus another star for making me buy the ""Special Edition"" to get it."
3,The return of the mediocre writer,The ending to the Star Wars saga should have been a lot better. I think that Mark Hamill tried to take some acting lessons before he filmed Jedi because he looks like he is trying to be a master thespian. He spouts off his lines like he is on a stage and not in front of a blue screen. The addition of the ewoks makes this look like muppets in space. I heard that Lucas originally wanted a planet of wookies and that would have worked much better but I guess he was going for the kiddie audience like he did in The Phantom Menace. He should have gotten some help with the script like he did with Empire and maybe even give up directing it also. Lucas still has great effects but he needs a lot of work on character development and emotion. I already noticed a lot of cheesy lines in the trailers for his next movie The Attack of the Clones. If you want to watch the best of the chapters then watch The Empire Strikes Back.
3,great end to the trilogy,"i think the reason it shows the punk kid is because that is anakin at the last point in his life (barring his turn back in front of the emperor) where he was a member of the light side of the force. i, too, would have given this movie five stars but for one thing. those damn ewoks. those furry little punks completely ruin the movie. the only subplot worth watching is luke's. why couldn't there be an army of wookies in the forest? the reason people hate ewoks is because they remind people of kids, and everyone hates kids because all they do is eat and whine about not having enough allowance. the last thing i want to see in a movie with lightsabers and an incredibly awesome lord of evil is a bunch of little brats running around making squeeking noises. too bad they didn't destroy endor."
1,bad transfer for a mediocre movie,"listen, as much as ROTJ is a dumb movie compared to 4&5 the transfer the 1983 version is getting is way below par. Save your money and buy the Film Noir vol.3 box set. I did."
1,WARNING !!! - NOT the Holy Grail after all,"The 1983 theatrical version of Return of the Jedi in this set, which countless have been waiting years for, is an inferior transfer. It is being made from an old 1993 laserdisc master and it's NOT anamorphic/16x9 enhanced, which is completely unacceptable for a DVD in 2006. I certainly expected better from LucasFilm."
5,Excellent!,Best movie I've ever seen! I decided to take it out of the library so that I could watch it while waiting for Episode One which I should be getting next week.
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"In today's day and age when even the extras are being released in anamorphic widescreen format, Lucasfilm decides to release this non-anamorphic. This release is inferior quality and does not deserve your hard earned cash. Oh wait, the '04 SE versions are being released anamorphic.....but then again you either already have those, hate those versions and will never get them or haven't bought them yet. Well, if you're in that last camp, you can do much better pricewise by buying the boxset."
1,"As if a million souls cried out at once, and were suddenly very disappointed","4:3 letterbox? Original theatrical presentation? Since when did theaters present movies in NTSC format? By the time we are able to experience an accurate recreation of our 1977, 1980, and 1983 theater experiences, in the latest home entertainment format, I won't need to watch it, because I will be able to go to my local spaceport and buy my own Millenium Falcon.If the original prints are faded, scratched, lost, eaten by Jar Jar Binks, stolen, mutilated, blown up by the rebellion, in another galaxy, or whatever the excuse is this week, how can you explain the excellent appearance of the ""modified"" versions? Even with digital restoration, there had to be something good to start with. Darth Vader did not kill Anakin Skywalker, and we want the true movies on dvd, with the best possible quality."
1,"Thanks for nothing, George","One, you are making any fan who really wants the original theatrical releases buy yet ANOTHER version of your ""SPECIAL EDITION"" versions which most fans already own.Two, For a compnay that prides itself on the best audio and video presentations, you are delivering a VERY substandard product for 2006.Three, Have some pride in your work. Sure, these weren't finished to your liking when they came out. Technology will ALWAYS improve and you could tweak your art until the end of your life but at some point, let it go and move on. But allow these ""unfinished"" versions at least to be experienced in the best way possible.d"
5,THIS IS THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE!,"I Sure felt bad for the Rebals in A New Hope and the Empire Strikes Back.For this One I think the rating should be 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000! I am sure glad the Empire Finally got a lesson."
2,The worst of the trilogy,"The emotion in this movie was just not as real as that in the first two installments. Cheesy, corny, poorly written at times. This movie was written for children. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it does not hold a candle to the first two. It was actually a let down for anyone who appreciated the first two movies. Over sentimentality and bad writing just don't cut it, and anyone who critically evaluates this movie and gets over the greatness of the first two films will see that it is really not that great. And the emperor was the stereotypical evil old man. Nothing original at all. Like I said, for children, not people who appreciate good writing, good acting, and real drama, not a commercial sell-out. If it was not for the greatness of the first two films, this would be a bomb. 2 and a half stars for the special effects."
2,The ReReleases Of The Star Wars Trilogy On DVD,Its Nice To See What They've Done With The Forthcoming Releases Of The Star Wars Trilogy (2 Discs)However The Extras On Them Are A Big Dissapointment i.e. No Original Makings And No Trailers Of The 2004 Special Editions. The Original Releases Of The Trilogy On DVD (2004) Only Had The Trailer To The Trilogy Special Edition And Not The Separate Spicial Edition Trailers Which Was Dissapointing.On The Star Wars Films 5 Stars But For The Extra Special Features 1 Star VERY Poor
3,Who is Anakin?,"The only reason I gave this dvd 3 stars instead of 5 stars is because when you watch the end of the movie and you see the ""spirits"" of Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin sitting there together it WAS Sebastian Shaw who played Anakin in ROTJ BUT for some reason it was decided to place the current actor who plays Anakin in the newer movies in that scene. Why they did this I don't know. I think it ruins the entire movie seeing that whiny snot-nosed kid sitting there instead of Sebastian Shaw!"
2,Why the complaints?,Well basically because we're being jipped from having 5.1 and the best image possible. instead we are getting a dated 2.0 audio track and no anamorphic.All we ask for is the improved sound track from the special edition release and the cleaned up footage!!! They already did it...we just want it minus the horrific additions Lucas made for his kids!oh and uhm...i hate ewoks.-edit- ohhhh the agony!!! people have already ripped this on the internet and made it anamorphic themselves!!!!
5,Great ending to the Trilogy,"This is a great Star Wars movie. The spacebattle is one of the best scenes out of theoriginal trilogy. The lightsaber battle isbetter than the episode 4 or 5, and the pitmonster was cool. The Ewoks were not as badas some people are saying. Overall you can'tnot like this movie."
2,Ewoks Dumb Down Smart Saga...,"I'm a Star Wars fan of fans, but Jedi hurts to watch after watching two masterpieces like Episodes IV and V. The muppets are obvious, and the Ewoks really turn a great piece of Science Fiction into a kids' Saturday morning cartoon. I'm sad that Lucas felt it necessary to sell out. Some may say I'm harsh, and that Lucas didn't go commercial; but keep in mind that though ""Ewok"" is a household term, it was never used in the movie...."
4,The end of the empire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I realy liked the movie it captures alot between the essence of episode 3 and 1. It displeesed me to see darth vader die and his head looked like an egg when luke removed it. the death of boba fett was disapointing too why did he have to die too early in this one. anyway I liked the part when lie met an ewok it was soo cute! the acting needed more work1. boba fett needs to talk more2. everybody needs to have more feel.so if you like the art of lucas film get this movie
4,Should have been the Last Star Wars movie,"This movie should have been the last one made. It was a perfect ending to the perfect trilogy. In this film we get to meet Jabba the Hutt and the Ewoks (I like them, dunno why) and our worst fear from the 2nd movie are confimed (DADDY!!!) This is just a really fun movie with awsome special effects. There's my 2 cents"
1,Joy! Another Cash in DVD.,"I love the Star Wars movies. They have proven to be the greatest Sci-fi movies ever and I love them.I own the movies DVD and VHS. I own the 1977 versions on VHS AND the 1997 versions. And trust me, the 1997 version was NOT needed, yet they still proved to be good.Now there's this ""2004 Special Version"" that was relesed over a year and a half ago. This is NOT the special edition, IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE THEATRICAL 1977 VERSION, just with bad CGI effects added in.Lucas, STOP CONTRADICTING YOURSELF. Us fans have already seen the 1977 versions and we don't need another cut. You just want our money, no matter what currency. We already have seen what we need to see.Now, I own 2 VHS sets and 2 DVD sets. I feel I wasted my money on the 2004 Special Editions. Plus, the other DVD set showed the films the way they were meant to be seen: 5.1 Surround Sound, Anamorphic Widescreen, and amped up picture.In Closing: DAMNIT LUCAS, LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE!!!!!!"
3,Weak acting,"There is zero chemistry between Carrie Fischer and Harrison Ford, so their silly 'romance' strikes an off chord here. I hadn't seen this since its theatrical premiere, so I was struck by the relative lack of special effects and how primitive were the existing ones, especially the Jaba the Hut scenes where all the characters are obviously fake. Again, as in the previous episode, the human dialogue is the weakest part of the film. The 'plot' is a feel-good theme, and the grand finale is a bit of a tear-jerker. In 25 years, this has held up relatively well, but seems a bit shallow by today's standards."
4,Another great movie!,Well what can i say. this is the best star wars movie i have seen. But i have take away one star because i think when luke skywalker is battling with darth vader it gets a little slow. This i a great movie!
3,A JEDI's end with nothing new to offer,"Okay, it's a STAR WARS film, so automatically, it's fun, exciting and full of spectacular effects that especially look great on DVD.Sadly, though, this is one of the worst-acted, worst-dialogue films I have ever seen (followed very closely by ROCKY IV, but that's another issue entirely)! The plot seems like recycled pieces of STAR WARS and EMPIRE, and even John Williams's score has very little new musical themes.C3PO's character has been degredated to that of a feminine interior decorator and Darth Vader has become a completely passive pussy (excuse my French) whose only purpose is to say ""Yes, Master"" and ""As you wish.""So for those who wish to keep knocking THE PHANTOM MENACE for all its flaws, just re-watch JEDI and you'll see really bad film making."
5,"There is no markenting sceeme, there is only the force","While the delayed release of the original versions available only with the spec eds is a lame way for lucas to get one more billion from an already megagrossing franchise, he IS putting the originals out. Though I still Suspect he has fallen to the dark side, Lucas is now officially off my #### list and is back on my ""mmmmmm... Star Wars"" list. Thank you for going back on your decision to make the last VHS release the final release of the originals. Seriously, Greedo shooting first was BUNK! Kids or no kids. Next thing you know they'll replace lightsabres with walkie talkies... better get these DVDs quick!!!"
4,Bringing Balance,"I am a longtime fan of Star Wars so I couldn't get the original trilogy unless there was a theatrical version included, which is one of the main reasons why the blue-rays aren't as popular as LFL expected. Return of the Jedi isn't my favorite movie but it's still better than Episodes I & II IMHO. By getting the old and semi-new version of this movie together it can appease more people and is a worthwhile purchase. May the Force be with you."
3,Hokey,"Star Wars was great, The Empire Strikes Back was good, this was cheesy. Everything, especvially the conclusions to the various conflicts, seemed forced and contrived to me. The sense of wonder was gone."
4,Finally the Original Release!,"Like many other Star Wars fans, I've been waiting on pins and needles for the release of the original theatrical release of Return of the Jedi, the version we fell in love with so many years ago on the screen. That being said, i wish that Lucas would of at least treated the original version with the respect it deserves instead of throwing onto a second disc, without any commentary at all. Lets be frank, most Star Wars fans already own copies of the movies, and would be purchasing this disk expressly for the orginal edition, and after years of waiting, it just would have been nice to have a commentary attached to it, not because there was really anything new Lucas could say about the movies, (except maybe why he tortured the fans so long with only special edition releases), but because the inclusion of a commentary would at least help us fans feel like Lucas ackowledged the original versions importance to us."
1,"Hi my name is George, give me your money and go away!","This ""bonus disc"" is a sad example of how screwed up Lucas has become. The original Star Wars movies are not even worth a new transfer to DVD? It's non-anamorpic to boot. I suggest you skip this release and look for a bootleg, which is pretty much what this is. Hey Luke, you didn't get any money from me for the 2004 box set and you are not getting it now. BOOM"
5,The Best,"Of the original Star Wars trilogy, this one is the best. It's not often you see sequals that are as good as episodes V and VI. The special effects, no doubt, are wonderful and the action scenes, including the battle at the sarlac pit, speeder bikes, battle on endor, battle at the death star, and Luke and Vader's showdown, are incredibly awesome, even for today's movie standards. The storyline may not be as sharp as the previous 2, but it is still an excellent ending. One thing I didn't like, was Bobba Fett's death. One, it was kinda stupid. Two, I didn't want to really see him die, at least not yet. Would have loved to see a lot more of his character. But other than that, the movie is one of the most exciting of all time. A must have for anyone."
3,Sexy Dancer Come Back!,"Ozzabb below describes perfectly the underlying faults of the conclusion to the Star Wars epic, so I'll move on to MY gripe. Does anyone else feel the 'special format' took some of the magic away from the originals? True, it did clarify the space battle scenes and the addition of the Hoth monster was cool, but the Tatooine scene in the first movie was WAY too cluttered. Realistic for a major town of commerce, perhaps, but the scene where the stormtroopers are manipulated by Kenobi looses some of its power.Yet that cannot compare to the terrible change they made in RETURN OF THE JEDI. The original music scene for Jabba's lair was dark and catchy, just the sort of puesdo-middle-eastern tune one would expect in such a dangerous and wild place. Why did they take it out? This version features a warbling pair of singers that are worse than some of our celebrated 'divas' of today, and the Sexy Dancer is reduced to a footnote. Agggh! At least I have the original..."
3,"Great movie, mostly for kids.","This third Star Wars movie is a pretty nice action movie, well crafted and very entertaining.The final space battle, bad guy/good guy showdown, is just spectacular: you really get to feel that the fate of the whole galaxy is at stake. Plus, the emperor is really scary here, you never have any doubt why he is the head bad-guy.For younger audiences, this will be a wonderful movie. As for older guys, if you can get past the fact that the great galactic empire is mostly defeated by a bunch of teddy bears, you will have a good time, too."
3,"READ ""Bonus discs""","It is pretty obvious with these discs being labelled ""bonus discs"" that they have not had millions of dollars spent making a new super-duper hi-res transfer from the 70mm prints...isn't it? Lucas will probably release better versions for the 30th anniversary on HD-DVD or blu-ray, until then, please stop complaining! If you don't want to buy just rent them!"
5,i love it,"i am only 13 years old and have liked the star wars movies since i was 5. most young kids like 13,14,15 don't like it they don't know what they are missing out on"
5,Conclusion,"Not only is this the best movie in the trilogy, this is also one of the best movies made. The special effects were good, the plot thickened, and we finally get to see the Emperor himself. The Ewoks were torelable enough to make this masterpiece get five stars."
4,The Star Wars saga comes to an end.,"Star Wars Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi is the final episode (yet only the 3rd of 6 movies made) in the Star Wars saga. This film presents the end of the Empire, and the showcase of Ewoks and muppets. While this film is considerably better than Episode I, it is the second weakest film in the saga. That is not to say it isn't a good film, just not as good as Episodes II-V. The 2004 version of the film is far superior to the 1997 or 1983 versions. I know a lot of people were angry that the old Anakin was replaced by Hayden Christiansen (young Anakin), but get over it. When I Jedi falls to the dark side, and comes back just before death, he reverts to the form he had as a Jedi when he crosses over to the afterlife. I guess George Lucas felt he didn't have to spell that one out for the true fans, but I can understand why someone would be upset not knowing that small fact. Now you know, so stop complaining."
4,"Thanks, George, for the ""bonus features""","The second disc of traditionally throwaway ""bonus features"", in this case is the ORIGINAL theatrical release of ""Return of the Jedi"", and is the sole reason for anyone to buy this DVD. So superior to the ""Special Edition"", the same care and attention should have been made to this material as the main feature.""Jedi Rocks""? Ugh. And why should anyone need to see Gungans in the original trilogy?"
2,Oh dear,"If you want the original Cinema release, without subsequent digital 'enhancements' do not buy this DVD.The original version is in 2.35:1 letter box (which is fine as that was the original cinema aspect ratio) within a 4:3 picture frame. This means that you not only get letter boxing top and bottom but also right and left. So if you've still got an old 4:3 ratio TV this will be OK (and thats all), but for those of us with widescreen TV's this means you either have to watch a tiny 4:3 image or use your TV's zoom facility to get the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. However if you do this you are reducing the image quality.Of the original 3 films this is the weakest by some margin, however if you're happy with the digitally enhanced anamorphic version then go ahead and buy if you like the film. However, if like me you want the original untouched movie as released at the cinema don't bother."
3,Low resolution in 1983 version of the movie.,"The theatrical version of the movie (1983) has a very low resolution. How low? Well I made some test... it is noticeable but bearable in a 26"" hdtv, it is almost unbearable in a 55"" hdtv and it is a sad torture on the 106"" image produced by my Full HD 1080p projector. So I do not recommend this unless you have quite small a tv set."
5,"Star Wars, Episode VI",Hard to find these old episodes. The younger boys love these movies and I ordered every one available. The picture is clear and color excellent!
5,good movie,it wasn't right away for me to like this movie it took afew viewings for me to appreciate itas far as the enhanced version its like the empire strikes back it told alittle more about the movie so I also like both versions too.the enhanced version of this movie contains a scene at the end which they used hayden christensen instead of the original character who played anakin skywalker.with this set I now have all three versions
4,Episode VI-The Redemption of Anakin Skywalker,"In the movie Clerks,Randal and Dante discussed TESB and ROTJ, and Dante described Jedi as having ""A bunch of Muppets"".Whether this is in reference to the creatures in Jabba's palace, or the Ewoks, ROTJ will be remembered as the one with the highest ""cute"" factor.ROTJ is the most uneven SW movie as it teeters towards the darkness of TESB, and the high adventure of ANH.Overall, it's still an entertaining movie that closes the saga the best way possible."
1,Luminous beings are we ...not this crude matter...,"There is no point re-hashing what many others have said before. No-one wants to buy this set for the 2004 edtions (surely there is no-one out there who wants that who didn't buy it already?) No, the attention here is on the so-called ""bonus"" features included with the set. These are not the films you're looking for!Vote with your wallets and do not buy this edition. It does not contain the ""theatrical version"" of the film. It is a 1993 Laserdisc transfer which contains many changes from the theatrical releases. It also contains a version which falls far below the standard consumers would expect from a dvd release in 2006."
1,old transfer = no sale!,"The original versions being offered on a ""bonus"" disc is insulting. These will be non-enhanced for 16x9 Televisions and come from a 13 year old video transfer. This is like the stone-age! So much has advanced since that time. It's also insulting for people who have already purchased the special editions in 2004/2005 to be asked to re-buy them at a higher cost to receive these ""bonus"" discs of a classic film in a less than pristine form. LFL needs at a minimum make a new transfer or the original trilogy. Release this on dvd and then later on hd dvd or blu ray. If that it done, I don't have a problem with buying them again. Give these classics the respect they deserve! Until then I am done with Star Wars. See websites like digitalbits and hometheaterforum for more information."
3,Well written,"The story is written well & the illustrations are also good. There is a lot to explain, so a child under 3 would need some patience."
4,Who is this RC & the Groovediggers?,"My first thoughts at listening to this CD was that is was another George Benson and Breezin'. Or, one of the Weisberg brothers? Anyway, this ten track compilation is as smoothe as it can get. I like this one paired with It's a Wonderful Thing, one of RC's latest.The soprano sax sticks out as well as the other horns, but the flute is tops. Come to think of it, all the instruments sound great!"
2,Ok but not great,I don't like the design of this product. It was cheaper than the other one I bought but now I can see why. It's a hassle trying to get it on the dog. I felt like I was figuring out a puzzle each time. I also didn't like how when my dog moved around or pulled on it the restraint was digging into her mid-section. Then there was the attachment clip. It's supposed to plug into the seat belt plug. Well mine kept popping out and wouldn't work properly in my Toyota van. Even when I thought it was secure my dog even managed to step on the button and release it! Not something I'd trust while driving with a window down. I ended up just putting the belt through the loop instead. I just didn't like the design of the product. I have another with a full vest type unit and am much happier and it's a one step process getting it on or off the dog. This one went into my pile of used dog items that looked good but were a disappointment.
1,Very Out Of Date,"Some of the components that are required for the projects are not easy to find. Also, the book is not very well organized. Im sorry I purchased this book."
1,Only for beginners.,"I purchased this book with expectations of seeing some worthwhile equipment to build, perhaps a spectrum analyzer, but found only very simplistic designs that cost as much to make as buying a new piece of commercial equipment. I would direct potential purchasers to The ARRL Handbook for Radio Amateurs instead. There are likely other books also that will fill the void left by this book."
4,good except,finding the ic chips is easy compared to finding the 3 secondary transformer used in the lab and the power supply. Iv taken apart 2 vcr's and a radio with no luck and no hope in sight
3,"Grate for knowledge, but some projects are not worth building","This book is grate in showing someone the basics when it comes to test equipment and how they work. Some of the projects in this book like the o-scope have a lot to be desired. An o-scope w/ a LED display is not my cup of tea, now a LCD display would be cool. This book is grate for building knowledge, but the quality of some test equipment makes it not worth building."
5,A wonderful CD by a delightful & talented artist!,"With so many CDs today being just so much background music, this is the kind of album that makes you want to lower the lights, sit down with a cup of coffee or glass of wine and really listen to every word, phrase & nuance of the artist's performance.And what a performance! From the playful ""If I Only Had a Brain"" to the downright funny ""I'm Pretty Mad"" to the poignant & touching ""My Life,"" D.C. Anderson manages to express a wide range of emotional truths with never a false note. And he has an absolutely gorgeous voice to boot!I highly recommend this wonderful collection by a delightful and talented artist."
5,An eclectic treat for the senses,"Truly an eclectric treat -- romantic, mercurial, powerful, offbeat. D.C. can rip your heart out one minute singing about the bittersweetness of life and love and two songs later have you laughing with glee. And...what a voice. Broadway, cabaret and angelic choir -- he can do it all!"
3,mixed bag,"A decent hodgepodge of BOA's work, but one of the best BOA songs included here, ""Hot Rod"", is actually a very unsoulful, very sloppy live version that does not belong on any greatest hits collection - and that kind of ruined it for me. Only for super fans who want unusual versions of classics or want a great cover photo."
5,THE DEFINITIVE ELVIS,"IF YOU WANT A COMPLETE STORY OF ELVIS, THEN THIS IS THE PACAKAGE YOU WANT. IT COVERS EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW. ALL ASPECTS OF ELVIS' LIFE ARE IN THIS SET. OF ALL THE TAPES AND DVD'S I HAVE ON ELVIS, THIS SET IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE."
1,horrible production,Nothing but a bunch of boring talking heads.The best buy is the new (from Universal) ELVIS: His Best Friend Remembers - that's the real value this 25th anniversary season. Don't buy this poorly produced pablum!
4,Great Beginner Guide,"This book is a great resource for learning how to construct not only the Looney Tunes characters but also characters in general, just from simple shapes like circles.To it's credit the book covers a lot of characters, but skims over everything but the top 3 or 4, even the coyote and roadrunner get a one page model sheet each. The model sheets are great as they show what makes the character unique, but they fail to show the steps in constructing the characters (it'll have a base shape and then the character beside it).Even though the books skims on these things it's still definitely worth getting, I continually go back and re-read and construct characters from it."
5,How helpful!!!,"When I read this at the library, I knew this book was worth buying. I had started cartoon animation on my cartoon character (named Sam the Fearless Cat), but this book really helped my flat, stiff, animation come to life! Includes model sheets, little animation tricks, plenty of art work (almost like a video), and drawing the looneytunes characters. I highly recomend this book!"
4,Pleasent surprise,Great book! A must for any fan or aspiring animator. I found the book an enjoyable read and full of info. If cartoony characters and zany expressions are your thing this is your book!
2,Beware This Movie is Avalaible....................,The creeps that are selling this and saying that it is hard to find are lying..............Go to www.fullmoondirect.com and the Puppet master 1-3 is avaliable. They covers are in spanish but the movies play in English.........with optional spanish subtitles that you could turn off. The covers are basically the same. But they are authentically distriubuted by fullmoon...............
1,Not very compelling as far as a horror movie is concerned.,"""Puppet Master"" just seemed like a movie that was so over the top and far fetched that the element of horror was completely overshadowed by the element of silliness. Like ""Puppet Master"", ""Child's Play"" involved a doll as well named Chucky that was a murderous little brat in his own right and even though ""Child's Play"" wasn't a great horror movie by any means, it had more substance and style than does ""Puppetmaster"". In short, ""Puppetmaster"" simply lacks the requisite credibility necessary to produce an effective horror movie...a sophisticated horror movie audience has difficulty buying these puppets as villains due to the lack of prowess necessary to effectuate horror within any horror movie setting...in other words, these puppets don't scare me...they suck and therefore, the movie comes off as laughable."
4,"Dumb, But I Love It!...","What I like about PUPPET MASTER is what I enjoy about many FULL MOON productions, that being it's weirdness. Here we have killer puppets, but not just some tired old clowns or whatever. These puppets are different! We get Blade w/ his knife and hook combo! Leach Woman and her mouth full of bloodsuckers! Tunneler's drill-head! And Pinhead w/ his super strength! There's also Alex (Paul LeMatt), whose pre-cognitive abilities lead him and his fellow psychics into the hands of the deadly dolls of doom! Oh sure, it's goofy, but it's also fun to watch..."
4,"Cheesy movie, but great buy!","I bought this movie because I had seen it as a kid, and I loved scary movies. This is a typical 80's horror flick with bad special effects, but I was so glad that I found a copy of it since I didnt think it was being produced anymore. The cover was written all in spanish, but the movie is in english. I am very happy with the purchase, but beware that its pretty cheesy!"
2,Interesting,"The movie concept is pretty interesting and it starts off good. But David didn't seem to make much an effort at all to actually disappear, I found all of tracking down to be corny but in the beginning where he show how much information companies actually keep on us, that was really interesting."
5,Love Never Sleeps,A great enlightened book for those who are caregivers to patients with Alzheimer's. Very informative -
2,A failure to cash in,"After remarkable performances by some real actors and a compelling story line in the original ""Firestarter,"" this effort to use it as a kickoff for a sequel flops. Hollywood never learns."
3,better than I expected,"Don't get me wrong, this is no great piece of art, but it's an entertaining and generally well-made attempt to continue the ""Firestarter"" storyline. Heck, it's better than the first ""Firestarter"" movie, though it can't hold a candle (no pun intended) to King's novel. Taken on its own terms, though, it's an agreeable enough way to spend a few hours. Wish the DVD had a commentary so we knew some of the creative teams' thoughts."
3,could be better,"If it wasn't for its almost 3 hour length, this movie would've been good. The story is interesting, however, by the end of the 2nd hour i was saying to myself ""will it ever end""? Many parts of the movie were repetative and unnecessary. But the acting wasn't bad."
1,JUST AWFUL!!!,I couldn't even watch the whole thing ~ I had to turn it off right after the first flash because I knew it was going to stink!!! I quickly returned it! BAD!!!
5,Should not be compared to the original.,"Many people are comparing this to the original and because of that are giving it bad reviews. This should not be. If you are looking for complete continuity of the original, then your looking in the wrong place.Instead, view this a a completely seperate movie. It's also important to realize that this was a mini series, not a regular movie, so it's long.Yes, it differs in many aspects from the original, but if you can look past that, its a very good movie/mini series."
1,Losing time,"I remember the first Firestarter movie like one of most entertaining stories of Stephen king, with a whole potential to make a sequel, but in this movie have almost nothing to do with the original, the story is predictable and the acting is the worst I seen in months, specially by the guy who play vincent.Even the soundtrack almost doesn't exist(you can forget the great work of Tangerine dream in the original movie)."
2,Sequel fails to ignite,"Eighteen years after the original movie comes this overlong (over two and a half hours), overblown sequel. Set ten years after the first film ends, pyrokinetic teen Charlie McGee (Margueritte Moreau) is now working as a librarian and is aiming to get her life back together. But unfortunately for her agents are still pursuing her and she finds herself having to trust one of them (Malcolm McDowell) and a loopy professor (Dennis Hopper- who else?) in order to survive. The story is nothing great, but I won't be spoiling anything if I say there are lots of explosions. Pity the rest of the movie isn't explosive.I found FIRESTARTER 2 to be slow, long and just not very interesting. The film makers (poorly) recreate scenes from the original film for flashback sequences, this doesn't work. Hopper and McDowell deserve far better than this. Moreau gives a good performance too, and for that reason this partially redeems FIRESTARTER 2 from 1- star hell."
2,Time to put the fire out!,"Charlie grows up as an adult woman still struggling with her telekinesis powers to start things on fire, a loner who doesn't trust anyone, gets over heated before shes about to have sex, still fighting the powers that be that want to capture & do experiments on her. If this movie was an hour shorter I would say its a okay time waster, instead its a very long tv movie that doesn't really go anywhere or explore much of anything new instead of having other children with different powers go after charlie, returning charectors that make not a bit of sense since they died in the first film. I wouldn't even call this a sequel, more of a remake or reboot as it doesn't continue with the events that took place in the first film, its like they disregarded it. they changed things about what happen in the first film and some things are the same. movie needed Drew Barrymore again and a better script."
5,Best all around Harmonica for the price.,"I have been playing harmonica for about 3 years and have purchased harmonicas ranging in price from $5-$65. I have finally realized that for me, the best all around harmonica is the Marine Band Special 20. The more expensive harmonicas are fine but at my level of playing, are really not worth the extra cost. I have 3 Special 20s now and plan on buying a few more. For sound, ease of playing and price, the Special 20 is a solid, solid choice."
4,A perfect interpretation of this well-loved song,"In this fun-filled, flamboyant adaptation, a grandmother remembers riding red double-decker busses and singing this traditional song when she was a child. She shares it with her grandchildren with such animated energy while they wait for their modern-day bus, that they all get carried away in the enthusiasm of the moment and their present bus passes them right on by! This book made my toddler laugh out loud-a great accompaniment to the well-loved song."
4,You Can Do It Too Review,The main character takes delight in showing her little brother the many things he's capable of doing despite his age. An inspiring read to children whose parents are expecting an addition to the family.
5,Su mejor obra,"Manuel Vicent nos navega por el mundo de tres personajes que aman el arte con intensa pasion. Un libro de facil lectura, intriga y amor que no debes dejar de leer.--tito lugo"
1,completely boring,"On a friend's recommendation, who happens to be an art collector, I bought the book. I found it to be poorly written, painfully boring and totally predictable."
3,"Full of Promise, but it doesn't deliver","I would rate this book at 2 1/2 to 3 stars. The subject matter is interesting in that it covers a period of our history that has long thrilled Americans. The author knows her subject matter very well. My main problem with the book was that it bordered on revisionist. I got the feeling while reading it that the author believed that everyone Dewey prosecuted was innocent and was railroaded by a fixed system. She never comes right out and says it. I feel that if she really believed it should she just say it and not beat around the bush. Still, all in all I would recommend it. It gives you a a good flavor of organized crime and New York City in the 1930s."
2,"Not very ""illustrated""","If you want this for the screenplay, it's worth it. Plus there's a few deviations between what was written and what was actually shot. There's also a very nice and informative intro by Paul Sammon. However I was disappointed with the lack of images and photos. There were some Cameron sketches and photos, including a couple rare ones (like the ""Burke cocooned"" one), but for an ""Illustrated Screenplay"" there needs to be more, I'm thinking at least 1 image/photo per 2 pages. When I turn several pages and there's just text, again, not very ""illustrated."" If you own the DVD or Laser Disc with the extra/supplemental material, you won't find much new or of interest here."
5,Aliens hasn't gotten this good!,"Great book! Like the movie is was suspenseful, action packed, and scary. The first book wasn't as good as this one though. The best parts are the end, and the part where Ripley is trapped with the facehuggers, and without weapons!"
4,Best friends,"The simplicity of rural Argentina is reflected with honest endearment in this story.""Coco"" and ""Bombon"" speak loud with glances, half smiles and heart about the struggles of people that refuse to go down without a fight. Cinema like this, reminds us that the most amazing stories are played out by everyday people. If there was awards for Doggy acting, ""Bombon"" would walk away with all of them, is not what he does but what we see in him that will make you laugh and cry.You can't miss this chance to be humbled by love, loyalty and a hero called Bombon."
4,"Interesting story, but...","I bought this movie because I am constantly looking for things to use in my high school Spanish classes. Story line is more interesting to an adult, and I enjoyed the film. However, I cannot use it for class because towards the end they show two dogs mating and that isn't in the lesson plan."
4,Fun Movie to Watch,"I admit that I bought this movie for the adorable dog on the cover. I really did. And the dog is adorable in the movie too. The movie is about a nice, middle aged guy that is sweet and sincere, but kind of lost in his life. He is hapless, but has a big heart. The movie is rather simple, but overall I really liked it."
1,expected a lot better,"Sorry, but this move was crap. It was boring, it didn't really follow a plot, the acting was bad. The main actor had the weirdest and laziest personality. Just completely disappointing. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Dissapointment,"I was excited about receiving this film since I love foreign films and many recent films from Argentina have just been excellent...except for this one. It does have a tender story line but so many good ideas seem to get wasted in this very slow-moving and uneventful film. I don't need a lot of action for a movie to be great as long as the plot is riveting and holds my attention. I found myself getting up to go to the kitchen often without pausing the film...I didn't miss a thing while gone. Do not recommend this film, don't waste the $$$ or time."
3,Overrated,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews. After watching it I have to agree that this movie is overrated. It's worth watching and the fight scenes are well choreographed but too much time was spent on comedy I was beginning to wonder when he was going to settle down to some serious teaching. I prefer ""Flying Guillotine II"" over this one anyday."
3,Overrated,"Mystery of Chess boxing contains good fight scenes, well choreographed and well executed, but not much else. The acting, cinematography, costumes, sets, and story are all average and not very good. The movie contains a good amount of ""comedy"", which I do not really like in kungfu films. The hero, played by Lee Yi Min, is not good at acting, and his kungfu is nothing special. The Ghost Faced Killer however, is a good fighter, and the fight scenes with him are excellent. If you enjoy good fight scenes but do not enjoy good movies, I would recommend this movie to you."
1,bubble,"Yes, the griddle is wonderful for pancakes. The problem I have is that the surface material bubbled up over the very center of the griddle. It is cracking and I see that eventually the material will flake off."
3,Nonstop oldschool basher action from 1974,"Wang Kuan-Hsiung (aka Champ Wang) stars as a gold digger who strikes it rich. Him and his friends decide that the first thing they will do is buy wives. Wang Kuan-Hsiung is sent into the town, and to my surprise, he actually buys the women and they go everywhere with him. Next we meet Lung Tien-Sheng who plays somewhat of a mysterious character. The story is not really worth going over. The action ranges from good to very bad. And when I say it's nonstop action, I mean it. The action starts right away. The first fight doesn't really have a point to it, but it goes on for a good 5 minutes, and the final fight for 12 minutes. There are only 2 fights that really stood out to me, but there are still 3 or 4 more that are decent. It's hard to recommend this movie, but I enjoyed it.2.5/5Picture quality on the Tai Seng DVD is decent."
5,Craigdude,"I saw this on cable in AC NJ in the late '70's at 3AM. I STILL can't believe what I saw. Some of the BEST moves I have EVER seen, long before CGI, and with all due respect to Bruce Lee, this will blow you away. Some of the fight scenes I have NEVER seen before or since. GREAT! You will not believe the one between two buildings, nor the one 15' above ground on railroad ties!On the other end of the scale the dubbing was a bit cheesey, and the dialogue from an early Honda manual, but it really doesn't matter. The best action film before ""Hidden Tiger"" and it is all REAL. You can impress anyone into martial arts by whipping this one out."
3,IT IS FOR KIDS ONLY!,If an adult is looking for beaded animals to all into a project this is not the book. When the beadwork is done all you have is a glob of beads and with your great imagination you have a beaded animal
4,Rachmaninoff,"I am pleased with the CD I bought, as it encompassed pretty much all the great compositions of Rachmaninoff and with good quality recordings."
3,What worked was great,"I'm not really reviewing Rachmaninov... I think the titles of the music listed speak for themselves if you know any Rachmaninov. If you don't know any Rachmaninov, I'd suggest you do so pretty quick.Anyway, I got my CD in the mail promptly, but it was buggy. It comes in two CDs... first problem came when trying to copy the music to my computer; the names and data of each song are not loaded onto my CD properly... all the song names on the second disk were the the same as the first, so my computer just overwrote them if that makes any sense, so I had a jumble of pieces and had to end up recopying, etc., yada yada.Second problem is that on some tracks the piece would stop in the middle, unfinished, and go on to the next track. For example, it would be listed as being 4:45 minutes long, but would stop at say, 2:24 in mid-piece and go onto the next track. Bummer.But I don't really know much about CDs, it could just be my copy, who knows. Other than that, what I did get is gorgeous."
3,Maldito Amor is a lovely song and the rest is not bad,"Lovely emotionally charged first song powers this offering by the Colombian beauty. At 8.50, well worth the price."
5,Excellent,"As with all TFF products, this is exceptional. If you're a fan, you have most of the songs on other CDs, your MP3 and anywhere else you can get them. However, this is worth the price of admission just for ""Floating Down the River,"" a boppy, Beatles-inspired song that will get you humming along from the first hearing. GREAT song that should have been released as a single."
5,Darlene Love is a Legend,This is a great CD...To hear such a legend....Her live performances are still great also....Thanks for making this CD available for the ones who still appreciate the older music....
5,Great music,"I love Darlene Love and this CD has so many of her best hits. You can't help singing along with her and moving around some too. She finally got inducted in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which deserved a long time ago. I LOVE this CD."
5,It'll make you laugh and cry,"I picked this up on a rainy Sunday, and couldn't put it down. It is described as a young adult reader, but I recommend it for everyone. I started reading it for the baseball but was quickly surprised that it offered much more. I look forward to other works by this author."
5,I Would Walk A Thousand Miles To See This Concert,"Vanessa Carlton is very good, her avid piano-playing and very good voice prevail in this album. A masterpiece. 5 Stars."
4,Theme From the Magnificent Seven,"I think ""A Thousand Miles"" is a great song, but is it just me or does anybody else recognize the piano riff as being from Elmer Bernstein's 1960 theme for ""The Magnificent Seven""?"
2,Too much piano & not a very good voice,"Piano in pop/rock is usually best kept in the background. There are some exceptions to this rule. John Lennon's ""Imagine"", for one, but that's a ballad. Piano in uptempo pop? Only Elton John and Billy Joel should really be allowed to do that. I find it hard to describe the piano playing here other than it sounds rather juvenile.Beyond that, however, Vanessa Carlton really can't sing--at least not on this particular single. She sounds like she's trying too hard to sound ""soulful"", or something. At least she's on pitch, but her vocals here are very annoying to me.The song itself isn't too bad, though the subject matter is common and overused and the lyrics aren't particularly inspired. This would have sounded a lot better with a different vocalist and a backing of acoustic guitar, bass, and drums, I think."
2,The girl needs voice lessons,"Though I do give her props for playing the piano, Vanessa Carlton's VOICE needs a little help. She sounds whiny and as if she is struggling to get her words out. A few voice lessons would do her some good."
5,Vanessa on legally blonde sndtrk.,"I actually heard this song first on the 'Legally Blonde"" Soundrack, and it quickly became my favorite one. Not to soon after I was flipping thru the channels and saw the video..., and now I can't wait for the cd to come out. Her music reminds me a lot of the likes of Michelle Branch, with a piano instead of a guitar. All I have to say is the world needs more awesome music like this!!!"
3,Good On the Piano- Needs More Vocal Lessons!,"Well, I think that Ms. Carlton is a very good songwriter, she can put together a very pleasant melody and the bland, pointless lyrics that rhyme in a perfect AABB pentameter. She needs to brush up on her vocal lessons, though. She's definitely one to watch for, with some proper training (or help of a synthesizer), she might just be the next big thing."
1,another sound alike singer,"Nothing unique or special here- If you've heard Natalie Imbruglia,Jewel,Sheryl Crow,or Alanis Morrisette don't bother with this cookie cutter commercial sound. Being that they all sound alike these days It's getting hard for me to tell the difference between these female pop singers of today on the radio. Heck she's even trying to look like Alanis!. Celine Dion,Madonna,and Macy Gray, now that's what I call unique ! The rest are all sound-alikes. And why aren't these other reviewers in here praising the piano songstress already out there by the name of Alicia Keyes ?"
3,The next...?,"I am writing this review because I have read other reviews that are NOT accurate. Granted, the song, ""A Thousand Miles"" is pleasant and catchy, but do not be mislead by other reviews linking her to artists such as Tori Amos, Elton John etc. Carlton plays the piano, but not as well as Tori Amos, or for that matter Elton John, Billy Joel and company. Carlton is a talented but very raw artist that was polished up in a studio. However, this does not mean that her music isn't nice to listen to. Just don't buy her music expecting an artist of Amos / Ben Folds caliber."
2,THIS SONG IS IS SO TRITE!,"I have to admit, the first time I listened to this song I almost exploded. This song is no different than any other pop song on the radio and the lyrics are so trite and cliche! There's nothing original about this song ""A thousand miles"". Whoever buys this single or her album is somewhat brain dead in music and lyrics. Her lyrics are so unreal and she uses the usual rhyming words ""sky, by"" etc... It seems to me a third grader could write this song in an elementary class and get barely and praise in the class. I can't believe this song is getting airplay on the radio. I gave this song 2 stars instead of 1 because she plays the piano and that is better than other pop singers who have other people play and write their own music."
1,The worst song of 2002...,"This song is just plain bad. And even if it was good, it would be getting kinda overplayed after hearing it 1000 times on the radio.Grade:D-What that means:No. Just no."
5,there is hope,"Christy Scheck did not have to die. The mental health system is getting better but there is so far to go. Especially in the eyes of the public. People with mental illness are not lepers, they just need medicine as a diabetic needs insulin. The general public is so ill-informed. This book is about this young girl who got caught up in the protocol of management and money and greed, and she did not have to die. There is hope and with movies like A Beautiful Mind and Girl, Interrupted and others, like Mike Wallace and Kim Basinger to bring mental health to the forefront of society, it will not hide behind the doors any longer, and will be dealt with in the dignified manner it deserves."
4,A great overview of the cars and their history,"Finding almost any literature about FIAT that is both positive and in English is difficult at best, however this book is a welcome break from that situation. If you have a passing interest in this mark, then this book will be appreciated. If you have a true interest in FIAT, then this book is like a good Italian meal, delicious to enjoy, but leaving you with a great desire for more. I only wish it was about three times greater in length."
3,Basic intro to the History of the Spider,"This is a book for Fiat 124 beginners. It gives a basic historical background (albeit from a British point-of-view - 124 Spiders are quite rare in England, and the author's advice and opinion reflect that fact). There is no mechanical or other such advice in the book. It is a pretty, picture laden coffee table book for those interested in the story of Fiat's 124 Spider. Special note: many of the figures and ""facts"" presented in the book are disputed by other authorities, especially those in the business of selling Fiat Spider parts. No one, it seems, is able to agree on things like whether the turbo model was sold in production year 1982 or how many were made, etc. Take all ""facts"" presented with a grain of salt, especially if you use any of this information as the basis for beginning a Fiat Spider collection."
2,Unfair,"I have been advised by BIG FIVE salesman to buy this reel for saltwater salmon, even as I said it seemeed a little heavy for casting, and asked specifically if it was designed for saltwater. I checked on the package, but nothing is written. When I came home, I checked on INTERNET. I saw that this reel is recommended by brandmaker for freshwater fishing, and the price is 28 $ on the net, near 50 $ at the shop (vat excluded).I have not yet fished with this reel, I cannot change it as I opened the package, and ABU GARCIA is unfair too as it does not say on the package that it is made for freshwater. I am afraid it will not last very long. Very frustrated !!!"
5,Very pleased,"I couldn't be happier. The product was shipped to me in a timely manner, and in perfect condition. Thank you for a great fishing reel. It will be put to good use."
2,Good For A Bluegill Pond,"I've had this guy for a month now and simply, I'm back online looking for somethings that's gonna be more reliable. There is nothing smooth about this reel. I took it bass fishing only a couple times and I've ended up only throwing it into the lake."
2,idle exercize,"There is only one strong paragraph in this mercifully short, dissatisfying book...a quotation from Borges.When you reach that paragraph you straighten up like a passenger whose car has just passed from a rutted dirt track to a paved road. Constant homage is paid to various mentors and proteges in that ""I'll footnote you if you footnote me"" way.A certain kind of French cul de sac...if only they esteemed their subject as much as one another.Sample sentence: ""The multifaceted return of the author in critical problematics takes us back to the question that Foucault posed...."" Daddy are we there yet?"
2,Not very memorable,"I read this book years ago (and own it) and can barely remember any of the characters or plot. It's worth noting, perhaps, that this author's real name is Hargurchet Singh Bhabra (H.S. Bhabra), who wrote the quite lovely book ""Gestures"". As A.M. Kabal he wrote several thrillers, of which ""The Adversary"" was probably the best."
4,Great for 2-3 Year Old,"When my son was 2-3 years old, we listened to this album in the car over and over. It was tolerable for an adult, and my son loved it. We both learned about some animals we had never heard of before!"
5,Excellent for student of Persian and Rumi,"I am a student of Persian with a particular interest in Rumi. I found this volume very helpful in both regards. It consists of 252 quatrains by Rumi in an elegant and legible nastaaliq hand, which I found very useful as a way of familiarizing myself with this script which can be quite challenging to beginners. Each quatrain is followed by a transliteration, a word for word translation, and a clear translation in contemporary English. This is ideal for someone learning to read, write and pronounce Persian. There is a glossary of terms which is good as far as it goes but is quite brief. Something along the lines of the notes to Nicholson's Selected Poems from the Diven-e Shames-e Tabrizi would have made the volume even more useful for the student of Rumi."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"The program mastered on this DVD is defective. It is very old and has been boxed up to look like a new release. The program itself is poorly made and is missing important text such as the entire ""fact"" box, lower third Identifications of interview subjects and subtitles. I wrote to the distributor Madacy Home Video to let them know their mastered program was defective but received no reply. Don't waste your money on purchasing this item."
4,"Great B-sides, Bad Single","Garbage's new single ""Why Do You Love Me"" is one of their weakest releases ever. Fine by current radio standards, not so great by Garbage standards.But the three b-sides (and no crap remixes) make this one of their most fully loaded singles packages.The two Garbage originals are interesting, and the Ramones cover is a lot of fun, despite what snotty fans of that band may think of it. It's a nice addition to this set, for anybody who likes Garbage, but couldn't be bothered to buy the stupid Ramones tribute from a few years ago and wants more than a cheesy download of the song."
3,Space Can Come Through Anyone,"Though Why Do You Love Me is a good song on its own, there's another reason why this single is worth the purchase: the b-side Space Can Come Through Anyone. This song is good and should've been put on the album instead of the biggest weakness of Bleed Like Me: Sex Is Not The Enemy. Space is far more fun and innovative than the bland, uncreative Sex and has a slight Version 2.0 feel to it.The completely acoustic Nobody Can Win is just okay, and shows that Garbage definitely needs more than just a guitar and the vague presence of a glockenspiel in the background to craft a good song. Also, a rock album like Bleed Like Me doesn't need an acoustic song, especially this one, since it would take away the raw feeling of the album.The cover I Just Wanna Have Something To Do didn't do much for me either, like nearly every cover Garbage has done. Since it got released on a compilation a few years ago, I think Garbage could've done far better by putting a new b-side on here."
4,Crazy For It,This is a really fun book for both girls and boys. It is easy to read and is humorous. Oliver gets into some fun scrapes. My daughter's third grade teacher reads it to her class every year and they love it!
4,Great Naontech book!,"The overall read was most enjoyable. But, after reading Nanofuture by J. Storrs Hall, PhD, a recognized expert in nanotechnology, I found some of the depictions of the uses of the technology ""overblown"". Dr. Hall is very skeptical about the ""gray goo"" scenario and doesn't believe that it could happen and I tend to agree with him on this point. (I believe Mr. Marlow took some literary license in depicting that aspect of nanotechnology.) But, even with this criticism, it was an excellent story. The pacing was good and kept the reader's attention."
5,great investment,"This pan is so durable! We have it about 4 years and there is no sign of any wear! It washes so nicely. When we bought it, it came with metal scrubber to prove that you can clean it with metal with no problem. You need to use tiny bit of oil, but not much. I went on their website to try to buy more when I learned that it uses some teflon inside, but only in temp 500-600 degrees it gets released. So it should not be released in food. For complete purist-time to go back to cast iron or steel. However, I am still using this pan--what can I say? When something works so well, do not replace it! It was worth money we paid for it. I don't understand why this pan is not marketed more. I don't know of better nonstick pan with the same durability. It loves metal brushes and spoons."
1,Pathetic pan,"These pans are a ripoff. We're on our second one, the first stuck and the coating bubbled up in the center, e-mailed Scanpan and they said sent it back and they would see if it qualified for their warranty, They sent us a new one, same thing happened. My wife and her friend bought them together, her's did the same thing. You can buy a non-stick pan at a discount store and get a real non-stick pan. It really riles me that we spent so much money on a piece of junk. Wish they had a no star rating here."
3,Amazon dimensions listed for this pan are wrong,"I was excited to be rid of my old Teflon pan since apparently Teflon will be banned in 2015. Scanpan seems a healthier option. The pan depth in the Amazon description is listed as 2.9,"" however after buying and returning it twice to get the ""correct"" aforementioned 2.9"" deep pan, the truth is that the pan is really only 1.5"" deep. Amazon service is superb and they worked hard to find me the right pan. This is not it."
2,Disappointed!!!!,"Unfortunately, this pan did not live up to it's reputation. With oil, yes it cooks fine, but I am trying to eliminate oil out of my diet. Without it, everything sticks and burns. I felt like a child whose candy is taken away right before they get to put it in their mouth!!!! Sorry, but not what I expected on that end!!!"
1,Do not waste your money - bad product - no warranty help,"I fell for it, bought a large set back in 1999. Three products lost the surface coats, the handle on a fourth broke off half way down - not at the joint next to the pan. Company did replace pans/pots with the new and improved a couple years ago. New and improved is worse than before. Gets a scumming black coating no matter what you do. Company must have lost a lot of money - no longer honors warranty.Worse yet, I bought a Scanpan lid which fractured into tiny pieces in a 325 degree oven. Nothing burned. Juice from the roast still in the pan. Dangerous. Even though the lid had no warranty, I thought I would email them with pictures thinking they both needed to know the health risk and possibly replace under the circumstances. No response at all.Next stop is Consumer Reports - cannot believe the high ratings there - which is why I bought it."
4,A Good Extra,"I've been using a (red dot) T-Fal pan of this size for several years, and that one is a better heat conductor. The Scanpan is to be used with low heat, but it takes much more heat than the T-Fal to heat up - at least medium on a gas stove. I aim to use low heat with any non-stick pan. Due to this issue, there has been a learning curve for me in using this pan. I ordered it because it is supposed to be healthier to use. It seems like a durable pan, and I expect it to serve me for many years. It is convenient to have a second pan of this size. One of the lids from my Tools of the Trade stainless set fits this pan."
1,Scanpan Warranty is a Joke!!,"I have this pan - worked great for about 1.5 years but then began to ""bubble"" on the flat surface. Obviously this is a manufacturing issue & Scanpan claims to have a lifetime warranty on manufacturer defects. I sent it off to the factory & they refuse the claim due to lack of cleaning...I work in a freaking research & development department for cookware. I know how to clean a fry pan. Their ""claim"" is a small area on the lip of the pan - FAR AWAY from the main bubbling issue - & an area I didn't scrub completely because once I noticed the bubbling, the pan is useless to me.This is a complete joke & their warranty ""policy"" is apparently: unless if falls out of the manufacturer's box in 10 pieces all while catching it on camera with a factory representative on hand, we will not cover.Roll the dice if you choose. This pan is so expensive, for them not to treat warranty claims with the respect they deserve is ridiculous."
2,Underwhelmed,"After extensive research before our wedding we decided to register for Scanpan products to fill out our cookware. Just over three years later the three pieces we use almost daily are all failing. Two fry pans and a saucepan all have extensive bubbling or breaks in the nonstick. Particularly irritating is the saucepan - we frequently put a steamer basket in it for vegetables and the stainless legs (with rounded, polished feet) appear to have worn a circle in the nonstick. This was evident at a year ago or earlier. Frankly not worth the premium price. When we replace them we'll probably go with conventional cookware and give up on non-stick."
4,An artist that is worth a listen,Grace Potter is an up and coming artist that is definately worth a listen to. She is a phenomenal performer and has an oustanding voice.
5,Excellent music,I purchased this CD for my husband. He really likes the music. Amazon service is wonderful.
3,Its Alright,"The singer has a wonderful voice and the band is talented, however I definately found this lacking something that would give it more stars. I think I wanted a little more from the lyrics and a little to much Pop in this for me. Maybe I'd like the album before this better."
4,Great bluesy rock!,"I stumbled across this band a little while ago and was extremely refreshed. I'm a pretty cynical rock and roll music fan, who has been in a depressed state with popular music pretty much since the end of the 90s. So I was really stoked to find a band like Grace Potter and The Nocturnals who are keeping it real and playing soulful rock and roll. I would say if you like artists from Janis Joplin to Lynyrd Skynyrd to Sheryl Crow I would definitely check this out!!! Not quite as good as their first album - I enjoy the raw and soulful bluesy feel of Nothing But The Water more. But this is still a great album. Much better than their most recent effort, a self-titled album. That one was disappointing, failing to maintain the band's originality and instead sounding like a bajillion other radio-friendly bands. I hope we don't see another Kings of Leon sell-out with this band, they're much too good as themselves!!In sum.. check them out :)"
5,"""The air's so heavy, it could drown a butterfly...""","This Is Somewhere by Grace Potter & the Nocturnals sounds like a stellar Americana album from the 1970's. This album was released in 2007 but I like the old-fashioned feel to this cd, Grace Potter's voice is soulful and gorgeous from track 1 through 11. Standout tracks include: Lose Some Time, Big White Gate, Mastermind, Ah Mary, Mr. Columbus, and Apologies. The rest of the band sound amazing as well, Potter's songwriting is unique and strong. Every song has a catchy hook or chorus but without coming off cheesy or glossy. Another reason why I like This Is Somewhere, the album is not over-produced, has a laid-back and home-like feel to each song. I highly recommend this under-rated gem, enjoy!"
2,"Honestly, not too impressed...","Sadly, I really don't like this album at all. Nothing on it stands out to me, and after the first listen I didn't feel compelled to ever listen to it again. I know she is talented woman with a great band. Luckily I did not base my opinion of her on this cd, because I thoroughly enjoyed seeing her live and would see her again. It just doesn't seem like a good representation of what this band CAN do..."
2,Very weak offering,"Neither the slight songwriting chops shown here nor the performances are worth the effort. There are a few acceptable covers. Grace's voice is OK, and there's nothing wrong with the playing in the backup band -- there just isn't anything about it that particularly makes it worth listening to."
3,Tilted to the light rock side,"Maybe I expected a bit too much in retrospect. The buzz about how Grace Potter and the Nocturnals were tearing it up during their live shows piqued my interest and seeing their pretty cool cover of ""White Rabbit"" motivated me to check out this CD.I find this CD tilted to the light rock side, more radio-friendly than I expected, and, alas, just too smooth and slick. There are a handful of songs I'll revisit from time to time, but there is just too much vibrant, energetic music out there for me to give glowing marks to ""This Is Somewhere."""
5,gpn rocks somewhere!,grace potter and the nocturnal is awesome band. The album definitely rocks big time.
5,Best covered butter,"This is the best covered butter dish I have ever owned. It is very durable, dishwasher and microwave safe, and has a handle on the lid which most do not."
1,messy,It is very easy for the dish to get messy. The lid sits down in the bottom and so if there is any butter it gets on the lid. Better butter dishes don't sit down on the bottom part. It doesn't even look that nice since the bottom and top are slightly different colors. Not recommeded.
1,Rude Sellers!,"Product is fine, but sellers are extremely rude when there is a problem and always blame the buyer. They don't take any responsibility! Very frustrating! They could at least offer to check with their Post Office when things go missing!"
2,Introduction to Cultural Ecology = Dull!,This book is very dull. Not a fun read in the slightest. I had to chug through it for a college class. Don't go out of your way to read it unless you have no other choice.
4,the comic detective,"This was my first encounter with Aurelio Zen. I'm not sure if this is comic writing with a mystery touch, or a crime mystery with a large dose of humour. Either way, the combination works very well. There is one laugh-out-loud scene where Zen is briefing his colleagues and no one has the slghtest idea what he is banging on about. If you enjoy detective novels but need a break from world-weary noir types or omnicompetent pathologists/historians/ computer geeks, then Zen will provide a refreshing change. Like the film Sideways, this is a work that wine fans will get more out of."
2,Poor layout greatly harms this book.,"The stories in this book are fun documentations of abnormal individuals.The illustrations are as dynamic and charming as you'd expect from Mr. Steadman.It can be very hard to enjoy them, however, as the publisher has taken all of the best illustrations and buried them in the spine of the book crossing the page breaks. What the hell were they thinking?! You can tell there's a great drawing there, but you can't even see most of it without mangling the book. This is true on page after page.Somebody who really doesn't care put this thing together slap-dashedly. It's a shame. It makes the whole thing not worthwhile."
2,Nice DVD but....,The owner promised to send the accompanying book also and never did. This could have been a great transaction but instead it was disappointing. Beware of seller's empty promises.
1,Night wolf's Captive.,"I did not care for this book at all.I thought it was a book that Kathtleen Eagle had written, when i ordered it i did notice the M. in the authors name.This was more like a childs book.About a woman who had been captured and fell for the man who captured her.I knew tha ending after reading the firsr chapter."
2,Kinda Cheep,"Well what do you expect for under $20, but when we got it it is no more than a thin fabric with a screen print on it. The print is not vibrent or rich but looks faded. It is also very thin and almost transparent. The other flags we have are bold and rich looking, you dont want cardboard thick but american flag thick. This one I dont think will last the season. But if you want something quick and cheep it may work for you.The stitching for the top seems to be holding well on our flag rod and the design is nice. It is just hard to see in bright sun or if there is any wind and it is moving."
2,Easter flag printing,I was so disappointed that this flag was only imprinted on one side. Any flag with wording on it should be clearly printed on each side. The colors are pretty and it's too late to get another Easter flag but I wouldn't order from this company again.
2,We've played it once or twice,"This CD is okay--lots of classical-ish songs and french stuff. Perhaps a little boring, not much to sing along to. In fairness to the product, those are exactly the types of songs featured in the movie!"
4,Nice for Background Music-true to movie,"I got this cd to play in the background while my kids were playing or working on projects. Its perfect, and we even like listening to it in the car. Its true to the movie, just nice easy music."
5,Beautiful music with just a touch of French,The music is great all on its own. And there is a lot of it on this CD. It has the right amount of French ambiance without too much.
5,You can almost still hear the hoofbeats,"I have some sentimental connection to this book, as my dad did went to Fort Sill for artillery training in the early 1950s.While it's true this book tells the story of the southern Plains Indians Wars from an Army perspective, that's to be expected, as this story is about an Army fort and Army cavalry of the era.That said, this is a great book to get a feel of that era on the saddle, especially if you combine it with something like ""40 Miles a Day on Beans and Hay."""
3,Desperately needs a new edition,"While some people might find this volume indispensible, I found it to be nearly worthless. Newer IOS features that should be covered, like VTP, are absent. Important basics like crypto key generate are missing too.If they ever release a new edition that addresses some of these glaring holes, I might recommend it."
3,Grab it and return it!,"We purchased the Grab it! for my son for his 5th birthday. He loved it. However, it did not move in all the directions that it was supposed to...we could only move it left and right, not front and back."
1,What A Disappointment! Junk!,"Please don't purchase, your child will be so disappointed when the toy arrives broken or simply doesn't function. JUNK!"
2,Don't waste your money,"These patterns do provide a nice variety of options for Cascade 220, but you can find much better -- and diverse -- patterns online for free. I found the layout of the book to be nearly impossible to follow, and there are not pictures of every project so it's hard to figure out what the finished object will actually look like.Save your money."
4,220 for Cascade 220,"The pros: There are 220 variations, which begin with a basic pattern, then present variations, such as a pattern knit, rib knit, lace, and intarsia idea. These can be adapted for any similar weight yarn, and the patterns I have used have run true to size and guage, with not all books/internet patterns do.The cons: The patterns will have a notation, such as ""the lavender one using Cascade color #) but there is no photo of a lavendar item. The photos are small and do not show the detail of a variation--think a photo with two black cardboard leg cutouts, each wearing a legwarmer, but the photo is only 3 inches tall/2 inches wide.I have generally been happy with the projects I have completed from this book."
3,Description found wanting,This valve did not fit the application I had. It is not so much a device that controls the flow as it is a brass ball valve. It is difficult to control air flow when rotating the knurreled knob. Also there is no stop position to know that flow is cut off. Instead you can continue to rotate around going from full on to full off and then on again etc.
2,*Yawn*,"""Child of the Holy Grail"" is the last installment in Rosalind Miles' Guenever Trilogy. ""Child of the Holy Grail"" focuses on the tension and betrayal between Arthur and his bastard son Mordred, as well as the arrival of the mysterious knight called Galahad. The story then shifted to the grail quests, the fall of the round table, and the scattering of the nights.I was very pleased with the first two installments in this series, however ""Child of the Holy Grail"" was definitely lacking. A huge portion of the novel dealt with Lancelot and Guenevere's love affair, which was rocky to say the least. It seemed like every 50 pages she was sending Lancelot away for something he had done and the Guenevere would call him back and then send him away again. On and on like this for about 500 pages, gets really old after a while. I was a tad bit disappointed in this novel, although I would definitely recommend the series."
3,Just All Right,"Of all the books in the Guenevere Series, this last one took me the longest to finish. Not that I didn't like it. It just didn't hold me in its grip like Marion Zimmer Bradley's THE MISTS OF AVALON, I guess, which is another retelling of King Arthur's story.By the time I was finished with Knight of the Sacred Lake (Book Two), I had grown too attached to Rosalind Miles's characters for me to just forget about them. That in itself shows that the characters have been pretty much well developed. What I didn't like so much, I think, is the unsympathetic way so many characters are portrayed. Sure, they're interesting, but maybe I was looking for more than just Guenevere and Lancelot to think kindly of as I read the entire series.If you love anything about King Arthur's court though, there's no reason you shouldn't read this. I give author Rosalind Miles credit for nevertheless producing a story with an interesting turn of events."
4,lovin'em,"Reading the series...Im a fan of the King Arthur era! Gets a little too, too with the fantasy portions, but, hey, it's fantasy!"
4,One Tough Critic-- and this moved me!,"Often in our fast pace life, we fail to capture the meaning of what surrounds us, and what it means to have our freedom. Sometimes, we just simply forget or expect it to be there. Ms. Pedersen, helps us remember. As a tough critic and picky reader..... I was enlightening to read ""truth"" that brings you in and challenges ones' own reflection of life and who we are. Ms. Pedersen creatively captures the truth, the stories of what many of us face directly or indirectly ... and for even one moment, that important moment makes us reflect and appreciate the wonderful world we live in. You will enjoy the stories as they weave through experiences, emotions, and will acknowledge our fortune of what ""freedom"" really means! I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. A must read!"
4,A nice look into the world of Harry Potter.,"If you're a Muggle looking to relieve the everyday, mundane boredom of your life, pick up ""Quidditch Through The Ages"" by Kennilworthy Whisp and J.K. Rowling. It's an often interesting and always amusing look into the favorite sport of the wizarding world (the section about Quidditch teams through Britain and then the rest of the world is particularly funny).The only complaint I have is that it's a bit short, and perhaps not quite in-depth as readers would like it. It's very easy to point out instances where Rowling deliberately seems to be shortening the book. But it's well worth the few bucks it'll cost, whether you're a Harry Potter fan or not."
1,Completely Dissatisfied,This book was listed as a library bound book. When we received this item it was not a library bound copy it was a paperback copy. There is no way that this book is 20.00 for a paper back.
3,Quidditch Through the Ages,"Great. Helped in getting a ""I hate reading,"" child interested in reading and pretending he was attending Magic school on a dreary, rainy day.A couple of hours of enjoyment and unleashing some imaginations.[[ASIN:043932162X Harry Potter Schoolbooks: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them / Quidditch Through the Ages]]"
3,A little disappointing,"Well I ordered a used one, so i didn't expect the book to be very new. And of course the book wasn't new at all, but still it was acceptable. But after I flipped through the book I realized a page was gone (I saw the tearing mark) and i wasn't very pleased with that... But I guess I wasn't lucky enough to get a good one... it's all luck"
3,dog car restraint,Does the job ok but is hard to get on. Each time I have to think about what goes where. It also isn't padded as well as it could be.
5,Paquito Forever,Paquito is one of the most important musicians in the jazz and Latin music history. In this CD he plays jazz music near a modern jazz with his fabulous Latin taste.
3,Carefully constructed dramatisation of Titanic's voyage,"It seemed clear to me, when reading this book, that Bainbridge was writing a screenplay rather than a novel; the most obvious example of this is when Morgan (main protagonist) and a friend get a tour of the ship from one of the stokers, and we get a description of the boat from stem to stern. In fact, almost as flimsy a pretext for showcasing the ship as Cameron's two lovers fleeing their pursuers through the engine room...Bainbridge has obviously done her research. Each little portent of doom (so easy to spot in hindsight) is dutifully woven into the narrative, and whilst this is quite satisfying to those of us who like to check off such trivia, this is all done at the expense of any real character development in a book that is already rather short.Worth reading; this is the script Cameron should have filmed."
2,I Was Actually Looking Forward to the Iceberg,"A dilettante sails on the Titanic and meets a number of strange and unbearable people. Nobody I could be induced to care about, though that might have been different if there had been any character development whatsoever. I can't imagine how this might have gotten published other than the cache of the author's name and the Titanic connection.Two stars because of the accurate description of the sinking, and because it is purportedly about Titanic. Otherwise, not worth the time."
2,hastily written Titanic saga..,"Every Man for Himself chronicles the lives of a several wealthy passengers on the Titanic. The sinking of the Titanic, while making the end of the book a rather emotional read, does not compensate for the dreary, impersonal narration which characterizes most of the novel. The wealthy passenges involved are pretentious, insecure, and thoroughly unlikeable idiots. Similar emotional traumas have been played out in much better novels than this. Worse, Ms. Bainbridge focuses too much time on the dialogue between the main characters. For much of the novel you forget that they are on a ship, let alone on the Titanic.Every Man for Himself is certainly not a bad novel. It's just very ordinary, .. a wasted opportunity."
1,Ho Hum. Who cares?,"I would not have thought that I could be so unmoved by the horror and tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic. However, this novel portrayed all of the characters in a somewhat sardonic unemotional nonintimate way. This historical novel was eminently unsatisfying in creating any sort of ""connection"" with me."
1,POORLY WRITTEN TITANIC BOOK,THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE WORST PIECES OF FICTION I HAVE EVER READ. SOME CHARACTERS APPEAR AND FLOAT ABOUT THE BOOK WITHOUT A PURPOSE. OTHER CHARACTERS APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR TO THE POINT THEY DO NOT EXIST. MOTIVATIONS ARE UNCLEAR OR VAGUE AT BEST. I WISH THE AUTHOR HAD RESEARCHED THE STORY BETTER.
5,Read this book and forget about the movie.,"Beryl Bainbridge's account of the Titanic disaster is a poignant coming-of-age drama cunningly cast against a backdrop of the world's most publicised naval mishap. Period costume notwithstanding, its central character's lust, love, and identity yearning are as valid today as it was almost a century ago. For those who prefer an intelligent read to some mindless, overhyped celluloid product manufactured only by Hollywood, the book will not leave you dissatisfied."
4,absurdity at its best,The setting:a larger than life historical event.The challenge:make it interesting.Beryl Bainbridge gets top mark for this.Perhaps the offbeat subtlety of the characters were misunderstood by some of the readers but this is truely British writing at its best.When disaster strikes it often carries an sureal quality and this book captures the moment perfectly.If you like quirky this is it!
2,What is all of the fuss about?,"Having only read this recently in paperback, some time after its Booker nomination, I found it difficult to see what all of the fuss was about. It's nicely written but has sacrificed character development or plot for technical description and, 'look at my research' detail. It's hard, I thought, to care about any of the characters at all and our exorphic knowledge of the ship's imminent fate led me to feel apathetic about the characters' fate rather than sympathetic. It doesn't seem to be ABOUT anything and, as we already know what happens, it's not a potboiler either.Bainbridge's prose is neat and clear but, ultimately, this is a novel less than the sum of its parts."
2,Child's kangaroo costume,I was very unimpressed with this product. It was hard and itchy and uncomfortable. It was sized much smaller then true size. It was way too expensive for the quality. It is not a brand or product I would every purchase again.
1,SUCKS,"First, this comment is for the size 4-6 that this item was originally sold as, which was the size I needed. By the time I received it and tried it on the 14 days(according to their return policy) to let them know the sizing was inaccurate had passed. Then, after calling to let them know I needed to return, they said it was too late. I couldn't get in contact with them and they never returned my call for the RMA number required to return. Then the 30 days to return had passed by 1 day when I finally got in contact with them. I filed a claim with Amazon and they had said I didn't do what I could on my part and I am now out $45 and a costume that fits a 12-18 month old. Oh, maybe Amazon forced them to change the size since this is not their first complaint. This company has horrible customer service!"
4,Helpful product,This kit is a very helpful for someone who has never used a telescope before. The flashlight actually does help keep your eyes from dialating while you are outside at night. All products are designed to really help the beginner.
4,"Not the best construction, but it works great!","I was delighted when I first turned on this light in the car. It made for a nice, bright reading light but was not so bright as to distract the driver. However, the second time I tried turning it on, I turned the switch the wrong way, and it fell apart! I did manage to reassemble it, but now we're extra careful when turning the light on/off."
4,Debut of mostly covers,"The title claims to present new hitmakers, but there are only a couple of ""new"" songs on the album. The majority are covers of the Stones R&B influences. There is a good variety here in these 12 short songs, and it shows you the origin of the Stones. This gives you a good idea of where they came from musically before Mick and Keith started writing the hits that would eventually earn them the title of ""Worlds Greatest Rock and Roll Band."" They hadn't fully developed their own sound yet on this debut, but it still sounds like the Stones we all know, if that makes sense."
2,"IT'S OK,NOTHING MORE,NOTHING LESS","IT'S OK,NOTHING GREAT,NOTHING TERRIBLE.THIS TITLE WILL BE LISTENED TO BY DIEHARDS AND LIKED,OF COURSE,BUT FOR OTHERS,BETTER OFFERINGS LAY AHEAD."
4,Great Debut!,"This offering is not too bad. It is nice to know that the Stones first two efforts were about equal and then they took off from there (unlike bands these days who peak on their debut album and then decline from there). As fas as this one goes, it has some pretty good tracks on it (especially King Bee, I Just Want to Make Love to You and Tell Me) but it is sometimes hampered by silliness (Walking the Dog has never been one of my favorites) and the album has one too many songs with the word Witness in the title. It's no masterpiece but it's a fun listen and it surely doesn't make the ears bleed. And, after all, its the Stones for the love of John!"
1,A Textbook? A Study Guide? What is It? An Obscenity.,"This is not the serious study guide to Plath's works that I expected. (I had been considering it as a possible college textbook.) It's a gamey 88-page volume of generalizations, paraphrases, and horrid little cartoon drawings of Plath (as herself and as Lady Lazarus -- in G-string and pasties!). Because the book can't quote more than five lines from any of Plath's poems, it paraphrases, which isn't the same as explaining how any one poem actually works. (The author says you must have the Collected Poems alongside.) It also contains proofreading errors and misinformation (Did you know Esther Greenwood was a 'country girl' and that's why she hated Manhattan?). Example of its prose: ""The artist needs to fly the roles but she is tied down and a person."" What a disappointment. Least offensive chapter: Chapter 7, a briefing on the critical reception of Plath's work."
2,Doesn't work,"I bought this product b/c my mother raved about how it stops pots from boiling over. I don't know what she was talking about... at most, it might slow down a boil over, but it definitely does not stop it."
3,Stopped working shortly after purchase,"A decent toy; not enough places to grip, the music can get very irritating after a few minutes, and no off switch. Luckily (?) the music changed to a mumbly gargle soon after we got it. My 4 month old showed little interest in it with and without music."
4,Time for a new one...,"My daughter has loved this from when she was a few months old. The rolling rattle barrel was a bit stiff at first but with plenty of use it has become easier to play with :) The music is pleasant, not at all annoying, the buttons are extremely easy to press - in fact the music will play even if the toy is just mouthed gently in the keyboard area - and it's nice to find a baby toy with more unusual selections such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca rather than yet another tinny version of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and Cantata 147. I don't like the sealed system whereby one can't replace the batteries; I think for a toy in this price range one should be able to replace the batteries and not have to buy another one if the child is still getting use out of it when it expires, plus small children get attached to things and the colours of this design change periodically, making it impossible to do a switch unnoticed."
4,Daughter loves it,"This was the first toy my daughter ever played with. She learned to push the keys when she was only about 4 months old. Now, at 12 months, I am buying my second one because she still enjoys it. The batteries should be replaceble, but other than that, we love it. The sound is pleasent, not overly tinny or annoying."
2,Not a griddle pan only a grill,"The pan does cook pefect steaks, and meats but i purchased as the advertisement stated it was a grill-griddle however it's only a grill....so disappointed with my purchase now i need another pan just for the griddle function and I love scanpan"
2,Deeply flawed when it comes to refuting Holocaust denier's arguments.,"I bought this book with the hopes to find a well documented book refuting Holocaust deniers. I was disappointed. The part where they actually attack the denier's arguments, are very short and exclude several of the misunderstandings about the Holocaust, like the crematories, and just include the most popular ones.Their explanation of historiography, however, was a great add. As well as the difference between revisionism and denial. Most deniers should really read that part. Buy this book if you are a newbie when it comes to this.I have done my own research and I do think deniers are full of garbage, but if you are looking for a book that will definitely refute all those arguments, this is not the one.Do your own research, look into the subject the reviosionists attack, and get your own conclusions."
1,"Sloppy research, childish name calling","If you are interested in the Holocaust in any way, stay away from this book.The research is very poor. It relies almost totally on second hand research. Much of which is inaccurate. For example, they claim Pat Bucannan wrote in ""A Republic Not an Empire' that we never should have joined in WWII. No such statement exists in the book. Instead they cite a secondary source when they could easily has read the primary source.Their study of historical issues are also laxed. When they write about gas chambers the continue to refer to Zyclon B as a gas. Zyclon B is chalk pellets. They clain the Nazis protected themselves by using gas masks. But Zyclon B is absorbed through the skin and has nothing to do with breathing.Most of the rest of the book consists of petty insults. They refer to Nerunmberg critics as belives in aliens and that Elvis is still alive.This book contain no new or serious research and is a waste of time for anyone on either side of this issue."
5,An important and very neccesary read,"This book is a godsend to anyone that is sickened by holocaust deniers. Written by the editor of the Skeptic, this book shows definitely who the deniers are, why they deny and explodes their theories. The author takes every denier to task and shows how the claims of those that deny the holocaust are totally and clearly false. From photographs to Nazi records the authors explode the myth of holocaust denial, a wonderful book. Really the essence if historical critique must be met with strong voices like those crushing those that would lie about history. Holocaust denial is a plague , it is a disease and this book uncovers those responsible and their reasons.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,not worth the paper it is written on,"All you have to do is watch Michael Shermer on Donahue to see what a clown this guy is. When David Cole points out that the gas chamber doors didn't lock, Shermer says ""you dont need doors that lock, you can slam boxes against the door to keep people in"". Do you really think the Germans, with their knowledge of physics and other sciences came up with a mass extermination plan and didn't have a clue how to build a gas chamber that was airtight?"
4,An Interesting Read,"While this book started out a bit slowly, by the end I was hooked and couldn't put it down.Sadly, I don't think this book will convince Holocaust deniers, although not through any fault of its own. Most will write it off as an attack, not bother to read it, or claim that it didn't ""prove"" the Holocaust while they refuse to accept any evidence that does not perfectly dovetail with their theory.Still, as someone who has no doubt that the Holocaust happened, it was a good look at how history is ""proved"" and also made me think of the broader picture of history beyond the Holocaust.I also appreciated the look at how the Holocaust evolved and how so many normal men and women were led to perform such evil and disturbing acts."
5,Cheap and fast,"If I should have bought this record box in Sweden, I would hav e to pay about 80 dollars. Now I payd about 23 dollars (including delivery!).And it took about a week before I had it in my mail box."
4,Great stuff,"The collection combines the best songs from some of the great groups of the 50's and 60's. I got all the songs I wanted, without having to find four or five greatest hits albums. I generally hate Christmas music, but the fourth disc was also very good."
4,Tomorrow's Sound Today,"Although the sound quality leaves much to be desired, the inclusion of this box set in any music lover's collection really should be mandatory. From the gossamer ""To Know Him Is To Love Him"" through to the soulful ""Black Pearl"", Spector rewrote the sounds of the times, setting the bar a little higher for anyone else producing music. Traces of The Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" and ""Baby, I Love You"" and The Righteous Brothers' ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" are still heard today in finely crafted records by artists as diverse as Green Day, The Sleepy Jackson, and U2.Fresh remastering would push this to a five star review but, as it stands, it's still essential."
4,"good box set, great bargain.","This box set has been around for while and is a great bargain at $18.98, marked down from $75. Four discs of Spector-produced tracks, when he was at his peak, including the famous Christmas album. The Ronettes, The Crystals, Righteous Bros.and others in the Wall Of Sound which changed pop music forever. It comes in an LP-sized box with a large, nicely-done book of the lyrics. A must-have for any student of rock history or the nostalgia-seeker. The Christmas album alone is worth the price. This box set takes us back to a more innocent time when he was a teen millionaire and many would say, a musical genius."
5,Buried Treasure,"Dropping this compiliation into your CD player is like finding buried treasure!! Phil Spector transformed the face of popular music with a ""Wall of Sound"" in the day of mono recording. I was delighted to find quite a few artists that I hadn't realized were produced by Spector. The book (not booklet) that comes with the set has a lot of great background information as well as song lyrics and lists of artists, studio musicians, songwriters, etc. Again, you may be surprised at the names among the studio musicians and singers (Sonny Bono, Cher, Billy Preston, Glen Campell, Harry Nilsson to name a few). This box set represents more than the work of one producer; it represents a sound that defined an era and inspired a generation of musicians."
4,A great collection missing many cuts that Rhino should have put out.,"All the hits are here played back on a vintage Ampex 351 tube tape recorder by Larry Levine and Phil himself in NYC.If you put the treble all the way up on your set, this set can sound OK.Why the Christmas Album was put in here I'll never know.I wish Rhino would have put this box together instead of ABKCO.Mine cost 69.00 USSome things go up.Remember Lana Clarkson. She cant defend herself."
4,back to mono,"this is an excellent collection of Spector ""wall of sound recordings"" for an incredibly reasonable price; you cant go wrong here"
3,"A good deal at the reduced price, but...","The sound quality is muddy and flat, no sparkle or crispness at all. Many of these were originally recorded in stereo, and there's really no excuse for those versions to be unavailable. Abkco is one of the worst reissue labels out there as far as the product quality is concerned, except for the Sam Cooke anthology. There are also ommissions in this set, such as Cher's first record, ""Ringo, I Love You"" which was released under the name Bonnie Jo Mason, and ""I Can Hear Music"" by The Ronettes (later covered by The Beach Boys). And as I said, the sound quality is very compressed and dull."
5,Love it so cool,To all of you people who are looking at the Reviews to let you know that thay are reviewing book 3. I do not know why but to you revewers of book 9 review the book that you are reviewing on that books page! On a happer note. I highly rekamend it it. I have read book 9 in sneek peeks. I youst to think that Hinata (the gril that like naruto as discribed in book 5 as a shy bernet.) was to shy and not cool but in book 9 I was proven wroung. SHE IS SO COOL do not let her at attitude deceive you she fites her brather who is the best in the jr. ninja and no it is not sasuke it is Ninji. he is in rock lee's grop.I'm am is sorry I do not know if Sakura wins her fist agent Ino. I can't wate to know what hapens but I know for a fact that Hinata dase not wins she nerly dies.and as you should know she has a crash on naruto and I hope naruto likes her to. oh so you know that rock lee is pard up with Garra of the sand. I rilly like it I hope you do to.
3,Order carefully,"This item is identified as a double ezy sock helper. The picture shown is of multiple items which caused me to order the item and having to return it for the one I really wanted. When they say ""double"" they mean both legs go in at once, like when you put on panty hose. If you want to use it for putting on surgical stockings, one leg at a time, like I wanted to do, you need to order the single ezy sock helper which is also shown but is not a choice to select as you order. If you enter the words ""single ezy sock helper"" in the find it slot, it will take you to the correct item. Also, it works for both socks or stockings so don't be mislead by its name. The item is very easy to use and is comfortable for wide legs."
5,Terrific rack,"Needless to say, this rack was the perfect (and necessary) inclusion to our kitchen remodel considering we put in a six foot wide window looking out into our garden. I made sure we included extra wood framing in the ceiling to support the substantial weight of the rack and its load. The rack is tank-like in construction and we can put a ton of our everyday pots and pans within easy reach thus eliminating the need for equivalent cabinet storage. I ordered directly from Enclume a couple of matching extender hooks to bring it down about seven inches (we have a 9'7"" ceiling) and it is perfect for us. Nice products. We also have an Enclume wood rack next to the den fireplace.Note to Enclume: Include in your catalog ceiling hooks with a matching hammered steel pattern even if it ups the cost a little bit. The ones supplied look like they came from the hardware store down the street."
2,Worked for a month -- then died,"I installed one BEFVP41 at the office, and one at home, with a VPN tunnel connecting the two. At first, I thought I won the lottery: setup was easy and it actually worked fine. After one month, one box is acting up. It died, and I cannot get it to work with the VPN feature. As soon as I configure a tunnel the whole router loses all settings and needs a factory reset. Phone support cannot help beyond the factory reset. Don't have an alternative right now, so I will buy another one in the hope that I keep 2 out of three working."
1,Worked for 2 months then died,"Tech support is below average using call forwarding to India. Unit worked for two months then died. During that period, the two units would crash every day or two. This product does not work for small businesses."
2,"Worked well, then failed. poor customer service","i bought this product for its feature set -- 70 VPN tunnels, DHCP, PPPoE for xDSL, convience of setup and use. all of that worked fine for roughly 8 months, then the box died -- no lights, no activity at all. to their credit, LinkSys Tech support were quick to offer a replacement part, but that was a week ago. in four days of multiple telephone calls, multiple promises that the replacement product would ""ship today"", and lastly a personal promise that a replacement would ship, i still have no idea when or if i will ever be able to replace this product. i probably should have purchased something from Sonic Wall instead."
1,Misleading Features and no Tech Support,"This product does not support popular L2TP or PPTP connections, but requires specialized IPSec client software to work (which is not supplied). It should in theory connect easily to another Linksys VPN but connecting to it while traveling is really not an option. The Windows 2000 or XP VPN clients can't connect to it.Their advertised Windows connection is really only applicable to a fixed IP environment which is very misleading.Tech support was not helpful (even hanging up on me) recommending only to purchase another software client to connect to it, that costs more than the router. When I did as recommended, they refused to guide me on how to configure this expensive software. I don't recommend this product at all, avoid unless you are connecting 2 Linksys VPN boxes to each other. Look for a VPN router that either comes with its own client or works with the free Windows client, otherwise you're spending big money and endless hours of configuration."
1,terrible,"This has to be one of the worst routers I've used. First, it gives me a ping reply only about 10% of the time and I have to hard reboot it to be able to log in and configure it. This results in me rebooting it about once every 2 days. Forwarded ports only work some of the time, and the only thing I have been able to reliably connect is internet to 3 computers. MY HTTP SERVER CANNOT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET EVEN THOUGH THE SERVER ITSELF CAN BE ACCESSED FROM THE WAN FREELY. HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?????????Terrible."
4,an affordable VPN box,I am attractived by the aggressive price firstly.But it did works fine. The VPN setting is introducedstep by step to establish a tunnel quickly betweenrouter and win2K.
4,Great solution for small business',"I set a small business up with 3 of these routers. The two remote branches initiate tunnels back to the main branch and they all operate as if on the same LAN. They are able to map drives and have an inventory program running that uses a distributed database. This is a great, low-cost solution for such an application!"
4,Great VPN Box for the Money,"I've read several complaints from people who can't get the VPN features of the router to work. Well, I can say in fact it works pretty well. The setup is difficult (as is with any VPN setup) but once you understand ""exactly"" how each parameter should be set, it does work. I've setup several connections to the VPN at my site with both the W2K and XP IPSec client software built into the OS. I rate it 4 stars because I've experienced some glitches with the unit (resets itself randomly), but it doesn't seem to be a problem that can't be fixed with a more current firmware upgrade. The overall features of the router are fairly impressive. However, if you need something a little more advanced, have a look at the Linksys RV082."
1,Terrible for remote access from a Windows computer,"I bought one of these routers two weeks ago and have spent many, many hours trying to get my Windows XP computer to connect to it as a VPN using the stock Windows software to no avail. The documentation that comes with the router is broken, and refers to an Appendix about configuring Windows XP VPN connections, but that chapter now only refers to connecting one Linksys router to another Linksys router using a VPN connection.After I started Googling around for more info, I find that this router can't actually connect via a VPN to a Windows XP computer using the stock Microsoft software at all!I liked my last Linksys product, but this one is terrible. Don't buy it. I'm returning mine.Gary"
3,Beware if you want to use this as a VPN server!,"Linksys markets this unit as having a VPN server that you can use to access the network it's connected to remotely (ie connect to your office network from your home computer). But be wary that this is not a simple task, is nearly undocumented, and may require additional 3rd party software if you have Windows XP Home edition. I spent more than a week and a half trying to make a VPN connection from my home PC, several tech support conversations, and used several forums and was never able to connect."
2,"Easy VPN setup, but requires massive amount of maintenance","The Basic router functions and VPN setup are easy to perform and work well.My problem is with the DHCP WAN connection. I havetwo of these units on RoadRunner and neither will renew theDHCP connection when it expires. Using the DHCP renew button onthe status page does not work either.As a result, we have to cycle the power on the BEFVP41 severaltimes per day to re-establish the DHCP connection.- a realpain! Of course many times this results in a new IP address,so I must change the security settings on the VPN to allowthe new client IP addresses to connect. This router takesfar more maintenance than it is worth - I could easily affordto spend 10 times the money on the hardware if the maintenanceissues went away."
1,Good for nothing,"(Tech support issued have already been described.)For me, a casual home user with a recurring urge to VPN to the office, it is important that the thing just work. It doesn't.It crashes (apparently, on the WAN side only) with symptoms ranging from DNS failure to complete disconnect, and up time ranging from mere seconds to 4 days max. I couldn't identify a ""killer app"" but I noticed that running VNC over VPN helps kill this poor device.I returned the unit as defective and got back another one, ""certified to comply..."" Same story.I've decided to just write off this bad expense. Looks just like what Linksys wants me to do."
4,Superb,The acting is absolutely superb. I was a bit disappointed at the very end. I had hoped that the future duke would have followed tradition and focus on his duty not his heart.
4,good kit for beginners,"If you're on a budget and you want to broaden your camera accessories for your Canon EOS- this kit is excellent for beginners. The tripod head doesn't necessarily work well with heavy, off balanced lens, but for the price- this is a good start."
2,Good buy for for economic telephotos lens,"I don't know in depth of lens technology, since I am new to this field and I don't hesitate to call myself a novice user in this field. However I have been learning of late about all this stuff and reading the reviews of lens.About Sigma 70-300 DG lens - I am happy with it; I get to play around a lot connecting it to Canon 450D. Worth mentioning that I got very good portrait pictures and macros using this lense. It covers quite a good distance. Backgorund blurr effect is amazing. Quality may not be called as ""Outstanding"" as compared to canon telephoto lens.I will post few pictures taken by this lens."
2,a simple review of magazine articles,"This book is possibly a light lecture, not really a well thought analysis of new patterns in new economy.The author simply makes a kind of articles collection and put everything together.Ther is no sign of interpretation or standpoint. That's all.You read the book, and in the end you possibly remmebr what you already knew."
2,ENRON Is One of the Dynamos?,"Seems heavy on the hype from the Internet frenzy that burned out in March 2000. How much credibility is there in a book that champions how ""sucessful"" Enron has been in exploiting the new economy?"
2,Why is this book so popular?,"After reading the reviews, I expected the book to contain good information. It does not. Yes, it mentions a lot of details about secret ceremonies, but the details are not correct. The book is written in a confusing manner and just not accurate."
2,Title Misleading,"Not as pleased with it as I thought I would be. I think the author tries to cover too much - he did a credible job with the beating the 106th and other units took the first few days, and I think he should have stuck with that and expanded it. He does very little on the countermoves and attacks, and what he did was done sketchily, I thought. He should have titled the book - The Bulge: The First Three Days - or something to that effect. He covers the captivity of those captured well, too, but the other parts - counter attacks - are glossed over - for example: 'The Second Armored Division, joined by the 3rd Royal tank Regiment, smashed a significant piece of the 2nd SS Panzer Division toward the western end of the Bulge.' That's all? Would have liked more on the I & R platoon's stand those first days as well. And then he includeds a section on Patton's attempt to free is son-in-law. Out of place. Worth the read, but set your expectations lower."
2,So so,"Yes, this is a collection of stories, some of which are interesting and nice to read. Annoying, however, are the many mistakes which make one doubt Mr. Astor knows what he's talking about (Waffen SS infantry wear black? Panzer IV Panther?). Some select individual get to tell us about their life before the war, who they married, what their father did, etc etc, rarely anything interesting to know. One wonders why this privilege is granted to some and not all, although I would personally preferred none of this."
2,Not To Good,"This book wasn't a very good book to start off with and I didn't enjoy it. The book was boring and I couldn't stay awake to finish the first chapter. When writing a book like this it should be written by the actual people but if not it should seem like they wrote it, which is the way the excelent author Stephen Ambrose does. My advise don't read this book unless you've had at least 15 cups of coffee before you start."
5,A Time In History No One Should Be Allowed To Forget,"I have had an interest in WW2 for a good number of years, mainly due to my mother's memories of my grandfather, who participated in both world wars. After reading two books from Germany's viewpoint, its interesting to read this account from the viewpoint of the allied soldier. A wonderful book full of insights, not only of battle in general, but the depravations suffered as a prisoner of the Nazi's. Truely a period in history that should never be forgotten."
2,"No maps, but lots of oral history",How can you write a book about the Battle of the Bulge and have no maps. I knew when he said oral history there would be no detailed analysis of the battle.
3,Not an SACD,"This is about the disk format itself, not a review of the sound or performance. It is positioned as a Hybrid-SACD While this may have utilized the DSD process at some point this is not an SACD. The cover and disk both have DSD but that does not be that the ""output"" is in SACD and unless all 3 of my SACD players have issues...it's the disk.Amazon should correct either the ad or the ""sending wrong disk"" problem because I have found that this has popped up a few times on boards"
5,A Folk-ish Sam Cooke,"An amazing record and one that is interesting from a historical perspective;the prograam was tailored obviously for the trendy tastes of the day, which would have been the mainstream, folk craze as embodied not only by Dylan (blowin in the wind is covered) but also Mitch Miller (a hootenany joke is made during If I had a Hammer) and his prime time sing alongs.Sam is the master truly. Great spirit and effortless sounding singing."
1,Rip-off!,I bought a SACD in Surround 5.1 sound and they send ma a standard stereo CD!!I would never Believe this from Amazon.
5,Worth every penny,Bought this pan for my mom and she loves the pan. She replaced her wok and can't stop cooking with the pan. Nonstick at it's best.
5,great size,this is the perfect pan for making fried rice or Asian fried noodle recipes..I'll be using this pan alot! Glad I bought it..
4,Seems to be what I was looking for,I haven't had a chance to read the entire book but it seems to be what I was looking for. Quick shipping. Item as described.
1,garbage. will only make you suffer further.,"I started putting great effort to keeping a good posture but the exercises are made to destroy your disc joints and overly stretch your neck very improperly. The pains increased, caused depression, and affected lifestyle.Please avoid reading or purchasing this book and read this http://www.drbookspan.com/NeckPainArticle.html"
2,This is a pamphlet -- not a book.,"Inside this 208 page book are 200 pages of fluff, bad writing, tedious repetition, and silly self aggrandizement.Go to the book store -- read the section on 'exercises'. It takes about 20 minutes.MW"
3,"Worthwhile,. however methods area bit dated ...","I've dealt with back-injury, pain, surgeries in both lumbar and cervical regions for 25 yrs.Have spent a small fortune on chiropractors, orthopedists, etc.This book has some good information,, some good exercises, especially for a beginner/newbie to back problems.While these methods will help over time, I prefer a more aggressive up-to-date approach which I found with,""PAIN FREE"" / Pete Egoscue author. This book will however benefit, IF you implement the exercises."
5,Recommended by our chiropractor - great book!!!,"Our son is a chiropractor in another sate and had given us a copy, recently we were having some issues and our Dr. here recommeded this same book. We sent it to our 2 other sons and are using it ourselves! Really worth the read and follow up for a pain free life!"
4,"Takes patience, and yes, heed the pain!","I'd recommend a slow and easy start with this book. This book is about extension (creating space between the discs so they don't pinch the nerves) but you also need to strangthen the muscles to get stronger. My back was healed mostly with swimming (try it!). I find that when I have to stand for several minutes at a stretch, the McKenzie exercises relax my back like magic. None of your muscle strengthening exercises will give you relief when you're really in pain. And it's better than traction as you can control how much stretching you can take. I had a strong and healthy back till my gym instructor introduced me to the barbell and progressed me too fast to very heavy weights. Which goes to show that when it comes to your body, take it easy and don't expect miracles....or you can end up worse than you started."
3,a rehash of his other books...,"while i found McKinzie's other books (treat your own neck, treaty our own back) to be great books, i felt a little duped when i got this book and it turned out to be essentially the same stuff..."
1,don't waste your money,"Compared to other book I purchased this one was a waste of money and time. Poor format, uninteresting and dull."
5,THE BEST,"For Back and neck problems,this is by all means the book. A friend of mine who is a physical Therapist referred me to this book. After looking at hers,,I had to purchase. It has helped so much with my back and neck injury's. A must for those to want to feel good again,,and heal. Perfect!!!! ***A plus,,get the Yamina ball studies also***,,,you will not regret it at all.Bought on her web site...."
2,Disappointed- was a gyp!,"If you've already read his ""neck"" book and his ""back"" book, then this is redundant, tho I didn't know that before purchasing it. I am amazed someone as renowned as he would do this. Clearly he was duplicating material so we'd buy it all as Ortho does when it produces the same pesticide and calls it three different names."
2,Tingling and Numbness,Don't buy this book if you have tingling or numbness.It tells you not to do any of these movements if you have tingling or numbness.After my t&n stopped I tried to do these movements and it came back so the book is right.This book is only for dealing with pain.For thoughs of us with tingling and numbness look elsewhere.
4,Great Therapy!,"I read this book quickly in order to deal with back pain. After reviewing it, and in conjunction with a physical therapist, was able to recover quickly. My physical therapist was impressed that I purchased this book, as he stated that McKenzie is well known and respected in his field."
2,7 Steps to Pain-Free Life,Bought this book recommended by friend. Have had back issue for many years and did not find any thing NEW to add to my years of experience and study.
2,Only works on disc issues,"These exercises only work if you have disc issues. For joint or muscle pain, they're pretty ineffective. You'd be better off with simple stretches."
2,Made my back pain worse!,I have an L-5 S-1 disc herniation with disc degeneration. I found that the exercises made my back pain almost unbearable and did not decrease my foot(sciatic)pain at all. Once I stopped doing the exercises I was able to bend forward more freely. I have found that doing hamstring stretches has helped with my foot pain. Just beware that what works for one person may not work for another. The author's one-sided opinion did not agree with the results I was having. I did however find the the tips on posture as well as sleep positions useful. I also have purchased the lumbar roll and use it at work as well as the lumbar night roll.
3,7 Steps to a Pain Free Life,If you have not read others books on the same subject this is a great first read. Suggestions do work.
1,Made pain worst.,I was really hoping this book made my neck feel better and it did the opposite. I followed all the instructions and now i can't even turn my head because of the pain i have attained by doing the exercises on this book. Not worth it.
2,"lee,lee",The tile sugest 7 steps so what could be so hard right? wrong you need a therapist or a doctor by your side to figure out the right positions not to hurt yourself! Take it to your PT or doctor and ask them if these exercies are good for your back or not? It will help some people with advice on sitting seating and how to move without re-injurying yourself.
2,Repetitive and uses the same diagrams,"Repetitive and uses the same diagrams over and over, should have been a booklet!!-could have said the important material in a few sentences"
4,Book works - You have to be able to treat yourself for neck/back pain.,"I had the worst 5 months of my life agonizing in neck pain....then I bought this book. I had scene 2 quack chiropractors (who probably made me worse), several doctors (who could care less because nothing was visible on an MRI) and a physical therapists center (which did basic exercises I've known to do since I was 12). None of them worked. Then I bought this book and shortly was on my way back to health. You have to stick to it and follow-it to the letter (I was doing a neck routine every 2 hours for a few weeks). It's not a miracle because you have to stick to it, but it gives you a real routine for self-treatment in every possible situation. Every now and then since I've been better I will re-aggravate my neck....and I go straight to the book for relief. Bottom line is with neck and back issues, you can't rely on doctors, chiro's, and PT, you have to be able to treat yourself...this book does that."
4,Works alright,"The sound quality doesn't seem to be much better than with the italk alone, BUT, on the plus side, it cuts down any harddrive noise from your ipod that gets picked up by the italk sometimes. I use mine for lectures in a relatively large lecture hall and the professor doesn't use a mic. When they do, the sound is great. I only have to turn up my volume about 3/4 for the sound to be good, but when they don't, I have to sit near the front and turn the volume up all the way. My advice would be to buy the italk by itself (or any other voice recorder, it's the only one I've used and I like it) and try it out. If the noise of the harddrive bothers you, THEN get the mic."
4,Great mic at a great price,"Pros:Inexpensive, records in stereo (quite well), lapel clip is very strong, and the mic swivels, so you can adjust it accordingly.Cons:The frequency is a little high, so some recordings may come out a little tinny sounding because there's little to no low-range on this mic. For the price, you can't really expect much. Also, I wish the wire was a little longer. It's pretty short, so you either need your source in your shirt pocket, or less than 2 feet from the mic. Also, it would be nice if they made this mic in black. Unless you're wearing a white shirt, it really stands out. These are all petty complaints, because the mic really does work quite well for the price, but there are a couple of drawbacks."
3,Doesn't work alone.,I bought this for my iPod Touch so that I could use it with VoIP apps. There is no passthru for headphones and the built-in speaker doesn't work when this is plugged in. Not quite what I hoped for.
5,Microphone for recording lectures,Purchased this microphone for recording lectures at the university. It works flawlessly and has good sensitivity.
1,Worse microphone,"I gave it one star just for its look. It doesn't work, actually it does, but I have to yell at the mic to get a tiny low voice recorded. Stay away!"
3,OUtput level too low,"While this works when connected to the mic input of a PC, it does not work with the camcorder I wanted it to work with. It turns out that the output level is just too low, and needs a preamp to put out enough signal. Make sure you know what you want to use this with."
3,Be aware - doesn't work with XtremeMac MicroMemo,"This lapel mic works fine with the Belkin TuneTalk Stereo recorder (and of course Griffin's own iTalk recorder), but it doesn't work with the XtremeMac MicroMemo. It plugs in and records as if it would work, but there will be no actual audio when you playback.The sound quality is good.The clip being flat, it doesn't attach very well on clothing."
1,Does NOT work with iPhone,"Contrary to several reports elsewhere on the internet, this mic does not work with the iPhone. You get no recording sound at all.Eric Monse"
2,Daniels is back,"I lost my liner notes for this CD. I am a jazz guitarist & I also play alto sax t It sure sounds like Daniels is playing alto to me. Daniels ruined gimself with that ""Bird"" album he did on clarinet. This one is selling for 1 cewnt & is worth every penny. I like Daniels, & hate to see him so down in his career. You can listen to the samples, so there's no need for me to elaborate on the tunes. For what it will cost you, buy it."
4,"Understated, sturdy, inexpensive.","This set works great for me, and it's not as gaudy or flower-centric as the others. I actually dropped the larger plate onto my linoleum kitchen floor, and it didn't even chip. YMMV, of course. Pick it up for the bachelor in your life."
1,Real Junk!,I have installed version 10 Plus upgrade and since than I have never been able to use the software. It simply crashes upon loading. Real junk! I wish I had paid attention to the negative reviews done my most Pinnacle Studio Customers and avoided wasting my money.
2,Caveat Emptor -- Studio 10.5 Keeps on Crashing and Keeps on Crashing,"While the ideas behind Studio 10.5 are great, the program execution leaves a lot to be desired. The program crashes for no apparent reason -- whether during movie review, editing or just a repositioning of the cursor. While, commendably, the program more-often-than-not remembers the last set up and position, you maybe repeatedly stuck at that particular point if the stars are not properly aligned. Also beware that each time the program crashes, Pinnacle wants you to file report; after the third time of the day dealing with them, the reporting screens become just one more point of frustration -- especially since Pinnacle does not seem to acknowledge or deal with the problems. If you have Studio 9, with its own annoying idiosyncrasies, you will avoid more aggravation by not upgrading to this much less than perfect product."
1,We demand a recall and a refund,"Never have I encountered a mega-software that is fraught with so much problem leading to a gazillion complaints. My wife and I bought Pinnacle Studio everytime a new version was released, thinking the problem of frequent crashes and instability will be solved. Now we have 4 versions (7, 8, 9, 10) of the product. All are unstable and a pain to use. The latest release (version 10) is by far the worst. Why such a ""reputable"" company keeps on selling new versions instead of coming out with remedies or patches to an existing product is a big question. When will they stop ripping us off. PS: We selected this product based on PC Magazine reviews."
1,Got it to work - Looking for another product,"I have to agree with the others who found this product less than impressive. I got it to work, but had frequent crashes with a 1GB of ram to work with. I had to restart the computer numerous time and yes, my DVD of extras was also unreadable. After using the product, I don't even care enough to get the DVD extras. Save your money and look at Sony Sonic Stage. That's where I'm headed."
1,Do not Buy,Product crashes and crashes. I thought it was my machine. read the pinnacle forums look for export error: real time. If you do not trust me. do your homework. pinnacle has issues.
1,Why are these still being sold???,I can't say enough about this program - it is a terrible joke. I had Studio 9 and had many problems with it so I figured I would try Studio 10 - thinking Pinnacle had fixed the bugs from Studio 9. How stupid of me.Please don't buy this product unless you want to be reduced to tears of frustration.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I hate to be so loud in my title, but this software is absolutely garbage. I work with software all day long and have never come across such an unstable worthless piece of garbage in my life. It's completely unusable...you will NOT be able to make a movie or anything else with this software. I've tried the tech support, forums, upgrades, and nothing will make this work. Even their tech support have no idea why it fails. You are allowed one call (long distance) and then it's $25 per call. It's $10 for every add-on transition that you want and they actually contribute to the crashing. Do not walk...run away from this software."
1,Incredibly Awful,"My first video editing software and the experience could not have been worse. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the software 3 times (each time takes hours), installed all patches and updates, but the product simply DOES NOT WORK. There are so many fundamental problems that it's not worth getting into specifics. I only wish I had read the reviews of the product before purchasing it. Save yourself a lot of aggravation and don't buy this."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM !!!!!,"I bought this program from BestBuy on sale before Christmas. It does not work right out of the box, the first thing you must do is download and install the patch. I was eventually able to successfully create ONE DVD project. Since then (mid December 05) it has NOT WORKED CORRECTLY. I've been through 2 tech support guys. The first gave up, and sent me to the second. The second, in 3 weeks, has done nothing but ask me to repeat what the first guy told me to do. I've uninstalled/reinstalled this program over 10 times, and it refuses to work properly. Unfortunately, that's the only thing the tech suppport guys can tell you to do . . . uninstall and reinstall again. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE HEARTACHE. Read the rest of the reviews, and I know you will make the right decision. I failed to do my research before buying, and am now kicking myself. Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!!"
1,Do you smell something???,"Do you smell something bad??? oh wait! it is Pinnacle 10 software that smells so bad. Don't buy this crappy software. I have a super fast computer with a ton of memory, no dice. It has crashed 32 times to 2 days and the patch didn't do anything. Save your money and buy something else. But...if your a moron and feel lucky....buy this product."
2,Buyer Beware,"If you were using Pinnacle 9.X to capture in DV Preview Mode, then switched to editing in Pinnacle 10.5.X you may find that the only quality of DVD you can burn is in the VERY low Quality Preview mode. Looks like Pinnacle forgot to bring this Disk space saving feature forward."
1,39+ testimonies can't be wrong.,"I agree, Pinnacle missed the boat on version 10. I spent (too many) hours attempting to produce my 1st DVD. Much of the time was learning curve, but much more was waiting and waiting, then killing the process and restarting after it froze. I thought my Sempron 2500+ was the problem, but after trying it on a new (HP) Athlon 3400, things didn't improve significantly. It just didn't freeze as much. Different than the last review the direct-to-disk worked the best for me."
1,Do not buy,"This product should have never been released. Not only does it have so many bugs that you spend most of your time trying to fix a problem and never get to actually create any movies, but the best solution Pinnacle Customer Support has is to uninstall the program and then reinstall it. I have had the program for about three weeks now and have not once been able to succesfully create a movie. Your money is better spent on another piece of software."
2,This product is not ready for market,"Getting ""Direct-to-disc failed, please try again"" 10 or more times after 8 or more hours of running each time. I do not feel that this software is to be ready for market. I would not recommend this software to anyone even version 10.1 from the company web site. The company should print what kind of video card required. I have to replace the video card to get rid of the warning message and to be able capture in MEG-2 mode but it failed again and again and .........System: Sony P4 2.4 GHz, 1MB RAM, and lot of hard disk spaces."
1,Piece of Crap,"I never heard and used such a crap product in my life.I wondered whether Pinnacle team really tested and QA this crappy software before release in to its customer.Even after installing their latest patch, product is of no use.Better they should recall this product and refund our moneyNever ever think of buying this buggy product. Better spend your money on some thing else."
1,It's like they all say....,"This program is junk. Pure and simple. It has many nice features. The trouble is they all crash your PC. I am a programmer myself and would be ashamed to release software that is this unstable - and charge for it! Too bad, it's a nice interface that is quite user friendly. Simply put, the program is not worth a dime based on it's complete lack of performance and high crash rate. Buy something (anything) else."
4,Lots of content and excellent results,"I can't believe the negative reviews here. I owned this and used it with Windows XP on a medium quality PC with a medium quality video card with excellent results. Yes, it did crash occasionally, but all of these video editors I've seem do that, even the new ones and Studio always restarted having saved my work so I never lost what I was working on. Anyway, I liked this program because it was fairly easy to learn, yet had tremendous power and was fairly fast.. faster then some of the other programs I tried out. I would recommend it to any one using XP and wanting a editor with loads of effects, all done easily and quickly."
4,Pinnacle and remote purchases,"I purchased Pinnacle studio plus along with 6 zenith remote controls. The controls arrived in fairly good time with a little delay. However, the controls still have not arrived and it is difficult to track their shipment etc. It is my understanding that they should arrive tomorrow although I don't have a tracking number and they were ordered on February 24th and even though I paid a heavy shipping cost. Outside vendors should be screened closer for their service."
1,Total disaster.,"Never have I had so much trouble with a software package before. While I may not have the swiftest PC on the block, I do have a pretty good Pentium PC with 512 RAM. Apparently not near enough for Studio Plus V10. The program takes five minutes to ""load"", continually crashes and is totally unusable. Be warned. Unless you have a super Craig and can take continual breakdowns, avoid this software. More bugs than a July swamp party in the Everglades!"
1,Very Poor Software,"This application is not stable even after applying the latest patch. Version 10? How on earth could any company write 10 versions of an application and end up with something like this? And how could they release this awful piece of software in the first place? The errors I encountered were not triggered by exotic commands but doing basic things. Either they did not test it or they tested it, found the bugs and then did nothing about them."
1,Do Not Buy This Software!,"I have to echo what everyone else is saying about this software. This software is faulty to the point of being unusable. It crashes constantly and has numerous bugs, more of which I'm finding with every use. The patches provided so far do not work. Buy something else because this program is a complete waste of your money."
1,If you really want to try it....,"I bought this software as a package ""Pinnacle Studio Plus 700 USB Version 10.0"". I was lucky because I was able to return it. I understand that stores like Fry's or Best Buy don't accept open software, but this one is not classified as software. Even though I agree this is THE worst piece of software I have ever seen in my life, if you still want to try it after reading all the bad reviews - this is the safest way to try it."
1,Pinnacle CRASH version 10,"I've owned three versions of this software due to varying hardware support, and I have to say it gets worse and worse with each revision. This latest steaming pile has a new feature in that after you install it, it takes over the file associations for all of your digital photos, so when you double-click a .jpg it launches a trial version of some software 1) I didn't want, 2) I didn't ask to install. Next, Pinnacle swaps out your DVD-ROM driver with it's own that in my case screwed up other applications that make DVDs. Third, it crashes so much I have yet to get a video out of it. Move along, there's nothing to see here."
1,Pinnacle 10.X Plus is the worst upgrade ever,Buyer Beware~ I used Studio 9 for the last few years with not a single problem. After the upgrade to 10 and all the fixes I have given up. I moved to Sony Movie Studio Platinum. Got it on Amazon for less than $100. Now I am a happy user and am creating great DVDs again. The product is a change but very nice. If you buy Studio 10 expect headache after headache.
1,Pinnacle Studio Plus 10.0 Waste of Money,After hours and hours of trial and error I nuked the CD's in the microwave then reformated my harddrive and bought vegas video 6 plat. The doctor says I will be fine and I no longer need prozac. Bottom line is do the same and move on. Pinnacle should be sued. This software is useless.
1,How long to provide adequate fixes,"I bought v.10 early on (late Oct. I think), upgrading from v.9. Was happy with v. 7, 8 and 9, but v.10 is completely useless. Since I already bought the product, I was hoping that sooner or later, fixes that truly work would become available. However, months later, the program is still useless. You can still buy v.9 some places, and I have had very good experiences with this one. I am still using it today while waiting for v.10 improvements ..."
1,Buggy Program,Run don't walk from any and all Pinnacle programs. They are buggy. They crash and lockup very often. Support from Pinnacle is much worst than average.
1,Be prepared to spend alot of wasted time trying to use this program,"I will not recommend this program to anyone. On two computers, both Pentium D systems with 2Gig memeory, etc... this program constantly freezes up... even following the 10.5 patch it still crashes when simply adding photo... can't even get to the point of adding audio... simply not worth the money... but most of all, it costs to much in time to TRY to use it!! AVOID THIS PRODUCT"
1,Avoid,"Very slow and crashes almost always--unworkable. Avoid. Fortunately, v.9 still does what I need for now. I would think three times before purchasing any future product from a company that sells such defective software. I am only giving it one star because NO stars is not a choice."
1,Doesn't do anything,"I got this software as a present so I thought it might be OK. but when I got it it hardly did anything. There are only 2 tracks of video so if you want to do anything fancy forget it. The summery says that it is simple to use. Yeah, a little too simple. I say, don't waste your money on this piece of expensive junk, buy something that really works like Adobe Premiere Pro."
1,AMAZON,"WHY DOES AMAZON WASTE MY TIME BY OFFERING ME A PRODUCT, GETTING ME TO FILL OUT FORMS, THEN REFUSING TO SELL IT TO ME SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN THE STATES???? WHY THE HECK DON'T YOU JUST COME OUT AND SAY IT ON THE OFFER???"
1,0 stars,"Software is horrible, I have been using studio for about 5 years and the new version 10 is awful"
5,this is great.,I am a junior in college majoring in Multimedia Design and I use this program all the time. I even use it for fun to make my own videos. It works with my camera even though my camera is a little old.
1,Pinnacle Studio 10 Fatally Flawed,"I have used Studio 9, and now Studio 10. Studio 10 cannot render a stutter free DVD! I have been forced to generate an AVI from Studio 10 (with titles and transitions, but no menus), re-import it into Studio 9 (which I thankfully did not uninstall), and generate the DVD with the older version. (All of this on the same machine in the same session).Pinnacle's user support response simply pointed me back to their knowledge base; they ignored my problem.Studio 9 and 10 are incredibly buggy, prone to crash, and Studio 10 cannot generate a DVD as well as its predecessor version.These are inexpensive programs, but you get what you pay for."
3,Do not buy it for dvd,"Pinnacle 10 is great for capturing and making a great computer file. Making a dvd should be done using software made for processing the huge amounts of memory necessary for dvd making. Even some of the best dvd making software can be difficult to use. Maybe making vhs tapes are better. They are easier to use and cheaper. Also- video on Pinnacle is for Pinnacle captured files only- trying any others is asking for trouble. And many found trouble, reading some of the reviews here. Maybe better to consider the negative reviews on this product as by people who triedvideo files done by other programs- should have never done it and then would not be complaining now."
1,Too Bad!,What can I say? I like the program (I have been able to create some succesful Dvds) but overall...due to many different problems...it has taken the fun out of editing videos. Hours on end wasted! The program simply doesn't work! If one problem arises and you're able to correct it another elvoes in it's place and so on... And pinnacle balmes it on your compter.Pooh!
1,Don't Buy,"Don't waste your money, especially if you have Studio 9. I wish I could give it zero stars. It's buggier than anything I've used from Pinnacle. Long audio dropouts capturing from digital tape 50% of the time and I never could transfer a finished project back to digital tape with Make Movie. It works fine with Studio 9. Pinnacle tech support by email is responsive but of no help. They just pull you through a knothole with useless downloads, updates, new drivers, etc."
4,Audiophile pleased with sound quality,I'm an audiophile I auditioned Amazon.com's Mozart choices on high quality audio gear and selected Essential Mozart and The Very Best of Mozart for about 2 cuts per CD I liked and I am pleased with the sound quality.
1,Physical CD Less expensive,"It seems foolish to get the download when you can get theCDfor half the price. Even if you pay for shipping, it is still less expensive to buy the CD.See:The Very Best of Mozart"
4,Reapply more than claimed,"You will need to reapply at least once more per season. The manufacture obviously uses optimal and unrealistic environments for its claims.The dispenser comes with a handy spout that helps spread the contents with little effort. I need 3 of these to go around a 3,500 sq ft home sufficiently.We use this as a part of the overall defense of our rural home. Along with Diatomaceous earth, Cy-Kick CS, bug bombs, and Hot Shot Pest Strips."
3,Killed bugs but not for long,"The granules are great because you don't have to worry about leakage. I followed the instructions and within hours, there were dead bugs. Unfortunately, the protection didn't last as long as it claims. I had to set another perimeter the following week...and again, the next week. By then, the container was empty. Great for quick kills, but not extended protection."
5,Kill. Kill! KILL!!,It seems accomplish the job that it says it will. I live in an apartment so it would be hard for me to get rid of all bugs.
1,Waste of money,"This product is VERY ineffective! Not only does it not keep bugs out, it hardly kills some bugs when you spray directly on them. I had a short stint of roaches (no help), stink bugs (they laughed at it), and spiders (they died after several minutes) and again, its not worth the money. Definitely a product that's falsely advertised."
1,Useless - DOES NOT KILL ANTS,"This product is used like a wall of sand, you put it outside and when the ants find it they have to walk around it. If you put it all around your house then the ants have to walk on the sides of walls (where the sand doesn't stay). Also if a little water gets on this sand, than the sand is useless. Big waste of money."
3,good item,"4 Alarm Digital Talking Watch with Date and StopwatchThis was a watch that I got for my Great Grandmother because her vision is poor and she can't see her clocks. She loves it. It speaks the time and date, and helps her out greatly."
4,talking watch,"this is a very impressive watch,every one that hears it call out the time is amazed that a littlegadget sounds so clear.This is the third one that I have purchased.One was a gift to blind friend andthe other was for an older person who was impressed with mine and wanted his own."
1,4 Alarm Digital Talking watch and date with oval face.,This watch never worked from day one. It is a complete waste of money. I would never recommed that anyone should ever buy this watch.
3,Didn't get good until it hit the underground,"The author could use a little work on his female character development. Just IMHO I thought she was written very slanted- like a man would view a woman. And of course every male character was in love with her, OMG. I love crime fiction & thrillers but was sort of forcing myself to get through this one. I'd never read a Ridley Pearson novel before and was unfamiliar with the characters. But once they found the underground, I was unable to put down the book. It got really good on the last stretch. The final ending was ridiculous, again, not reality at all, total cake. No way would Daphne want to adopt a baby, too unbelievable."
3,Not Typical Ridley Pearson,"I was a little disappointed in this book. Maybe it was because my expectations were so high that we were going to see a female lead instead of Lou Boldt. This was a good book but not what I wanted I guess. I am used to Boldt being the main character and in this one Daphne Matthews is. I'm not going to write a plot summary since so many on here already have. I enjoyed the twists and turns in this book, but it was just lacking. Not his usual excellent make me think stuff. I don't know why it just didn't click with me. I think it was because I didn't like how they made Daphne seem like she wasn't as smart as the boys and as smart and analytical as she has been in the past. Just felt like it was rushed. Still a good book and it moved the major storylines of the series along but I just missed the fabulous interactions and the thinking of the last books."
5,Pearson Has Done It Again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"LaMoia has beaten an addiction to oxycodone, and Matthews is turning into the workaholic that Boldt narrowly avoids becoming.Matthews does a favor for LaMoia and is sucked into a mess of stalking, voyuerism and murder. Her houseboat becomes an unsafe place, so she has two choices--move in with LaMoia or move into a hotel. Thank goodness she has the sense to know she needs to move in with a friend. Contrary to some reviewers, I found Daphne to be a strong woman again, but often unwilling to ask for help. Boldt is aware of a growing closeness between LaMoia and Matthews and it bothers him--but not to the point where it interferes in his doing his job. He's able to clear a relative(?) of Mama Lu's by proving he was murdered--then they find the killer(s) after Daphne is abducted. Too late to save the homeless, pregnant teen but not to save her baby, Daphne, and LaMoia."
4,Back Seat for Lou Boldt,"Lou Boldt & Daphne Matthews are characters from Ridley Pearson's long running series, but THE ART OF DECEPTION is weak and flawed. I've enjoyed the series, but for this one there are too many conflicts and unspecified undercurrents. Almost like the twisted streets of the old city that lies beneath Seattle.Bolt moves to the background as Daphne Matthews and John LaMoia moved to the forefront. The currents of physical attractions flow between Daphne and John when she is subjected to the attentions of a stalker from two directions.A good read for a late night, but nothing special.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
2,I guess I'm in the minority,"I am only one of few critics who did not like this book. As far as I'm concerned this book had two disjointed subplots. I had trouble determining the connection between the two. At times the plot, if you want to call it that, went on ad nauseum with literally nothing happening. I was bored but was determined to not put it down. I gave the novel 2 stars because the last 50 pages or so were intriguing and fun to read. More of the story should have taken place in the labyrinth of streets and alleys known as The Underground. It sounds like a very interesting place and alot of mystery could have been generated there."
4,Great infro to Pearson's work,Art of Deception is the first book I'v read by Ridley Pearson. I found it very entertaining and attention-grabbing. I am a big fan of suspense novels and I will be back for more Pearson.There were a few slow parts but overall I can highly recommend this book.
1,Painfully Awul & Slow,"I can't believe that writers as accomplished as Greg Iles and Michael Connelly blurbed this badly written book. It doesn't take off for at least 200 pages; the psychologist is as insightful as a talk show host and as authentic as a cartoon; the killer is so obvious it's embarrassing; the opening is incredibly vicious and confusing to boot. In fact, most of the action scenes are poorly written and the thoughts Pearson gives the first murder victim are just plain unbelievable, given what's happening to her. Worst of all is the flat-footed writing, with Pearson telling us, for instance, that someone acquiesces, ""less than enthusiastically."" Dennis Lehane can write rings around Pearson, and so can many other thriller writers."
2,"This book has a great plot, but it turns to lead.","Having read other books written by this gentleman, I anticipated a plot with some devious twists and turns. I hoped for something on the order of Parallel Lies, which I really enjoyed. Instead, The Art of Deception seems to be a scam pulled on unsuspecting readers. Pearson forgets that a sentence is supposed to have both a subject and a verb at the very least and the adjectives that he does use are used over and over again. This book is hard to focus on because the sentences within paragraphs are disjointed. The author has a great background scenario in the Seattle Underground, but he fails to describe it adequately. The budding romance, if one can call it that, between ""LaMoia"" and ""Mathews"" it dull and predictable. If you have nothing better to do, read this book."
3,Daphine Character Disappoints,"In this latest book,the character Daphine comes across as neither a competent psychologist or police officer. The author presents her as unsure of herself in either role. Being confused with the facts of a troubling and complicated case is one thing, but to have role confusion undermined her character. She was the least strong character and seemed to rely on the male characters to be rescued and supported. The reader catches on to who is quilty before her character ever has a clue. Otherwise, the story was interesting enough to make up for this one annoying character-development flaw."
5,GREAT CLAYMATION SPOOF!,Awesome claymation action combined with a great storyline and characters from many recent horror flicks will make you laugh out loud. I can't wait to see what these guys come up with next!
2,Sort of scary,"This was a really bad movie. But i had to say that it had some scary parts. That's why I gave it 2, instead of 1 star."
4,Still going strong (and getting stronger) after all these years,"Doesn't this guy ever get old? Here it is, nearly 30 years after his definitive live album, and Frampton still sounds like he actually still enjoys playing his old favorites on stage. Of course there are the inevitable Do You Feel Like We Do, and Baby, I Love Your Way, but what makes this album special is his unique interpretations of his newer songs from the Now CD. Verge of a Thing, and Not Forgotten both sound great, as do the rest of his numbers. Sad to think of Bob Mayo not playing here, but everyone here is a first rate musician. Hopefully we'll get another studio album soon from Peter with all new material; the Now album was his best since... well, I guess I'll just say it; it was perhaps his best ever. Also, am I the only person who would love to hear Frampton live with totally new material? Or maybe a disk featuring tracks with only Frampton's vocals from The Herd & Humble Pie years. (sorry Steve Marriot!)"
5,Classy and fun!!!,"This is the best CD I have purchased in years - beautiful vocals, great song selections, fun and innovative arrangements! It is a MUST HAVE for any music lover! Raul Malo has come up with a classy and brilliant way to present good old Country classics - it's like hearing these songs for the first time! Get out your martini glasses, sit back and enjoy! And if you get the chance to catch Raul Malo ""live"" in concert - GO!"
5,After Hours,"I have been listening to After Hours since it was released on July 17,2007 and I really love it. Raul Malo has the best voice of anyone today. He has such passion for his music and it shows in his cd's and in his concerts. His band is also very talented and were very good on this cd. They have taken these country standards and have made a cd that will be loved for years. I would recommend this cd to my family and friends. I think most people would be glad to have it in their collection of music."
3,Raul Malo - a great voice,"Raul Malo made others records better than this, but his voice singing traditional and old songs worth each penny spent. I still would buy this CD if I have comeback and having to decide....José Carlos from Brazil"
5,Marvelous Malo,"Just as I hoped & expected from this awesome, talented singer! Another great addition to my growing collection."
4,A great jazzy-country CD,"I listened to Raul Melo's 'After Hours' today in my car after buying it. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is a very nice country/jazz CD. To me it is more jazz than anything else and don't know why the album was the Hot Shot Debut on Billboard's Country Album charts at # 43 for weekending 8*4*07, perhaps it has something to do with him being a country artist. Anyway, my favorite track on the CD is #8, ""Husband and Wives"", it is a GREAT twangy, country/jazz song. His vocals on the CD remind me of Frank Sinatra. So if you like this type of music, I recommend this CD.KenLong Island, NY"
5,Smooth and rich,Raul Malo has become one of my favorite singers. After Hours is beautiful. Raul Malo has such a beautiful voice. I never tire of hearing this album or others he has put out. I hope he returns to San Diego soon!
1,What was Raul thinking?,"I love Raul malo - have most of his albums - and those of the MNavericks. But he has fallen off the wagon on this album. What was he thinking? The ""over 80"" market will just love this one - but not me. I've heard all these songs before - better performed and arranged... I gave it away to my 84 year old StepFather after only one listening - he loves it."
1,Extremely disappointing...,"I've been a big Raul Malo/Mavericks fan for many years and I've got to say this one is a major letdown after his last solo effort. There are a few good moments with ""Cold, Cold Heart"", ""It Only Hurts Me When I Cry"", and ""Husbands and Wives"". But others like ""Take These Chains from My Heart"" and ""Crying Time"" lack that soul and feeling Raul puts into his work. ""Pocket of a Clown"" is an embarrassment and I'm not quite sure what he was thinking on that one.I would have given this at least two stars, but subtracted one due to the album is just over thity-seven minutes in length. Unforgivable!"
3,Sorry Raul!,"Except for ""Husbands & Wives"" and ""For the Good Times"", I was really disappointed in this cd. Cold,Cold Heart makes me cringe! The other songs are only so so. I really wanted to like this album because I absolutely love Raul and he is so much better than this cd. If you've never seen him live, you are missing a great show. Better luck next time!"
3,chic thing,gave it a 3 because it is not for me. My bride likes it though so maybe I should have rated it higher???
3,First Alger I'd read,"Having never read anything by Alger before, I was excited to start this book. I'm a big fan of 19th century moralistic fiction (it's a weird thing to like, but whatever). I thought the first part of this book was really enjoyable -- a young man is left in the care of a horrible and greedy ward. Will he be able to use his wits (and exceptional moral sense) to prevail? Unfortunatly, the second half of the book was taken up with an overlong and tedious ship adventure.If the entire book had the pace and spirit of the first half, I would have loved this book. As it was, I found myself just longing for it to end."
5,beautiful beautiful shu qi,shu qi is one of the most beautiful women on earth. she is a great actress whether she does comedy or drama. any movie she is in is worth its price for her talent and beauty. i recommend this film and i hope the western world will appreciate her as much as the eastern world does.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Like many other reviewers for Scanpan pieces/sets, my experience with this cookware has been awful. I've tossed a complete set out after just four years of use. I'm aware there is a warranty, but why replace bad with bad? Besides, the process for warranty replacement has less appeal than a root canal. It's a joke.YOU REALLY OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check around on the Internet for consumer feedback/reviews on this overpriced and overrated cookware. Again and again you'll read about how the nonstick surface eventually discolors, then forms little bubbles, the surface degrades, then finally loses all its nonstick qualities. Take the time to read customers' 1-star ratings here on Amazon for both sets and single pieces, and you'll read the same thing over and over again. SERIOUSLY, FOLKS, THINK TWICE."
4,Simple operation,"I bought one for my girlfriend and she loved it. Easy operation and good instructions manual. The power button could be bettter, but I recommend it."
4,Great Little MP3 Player with FM Radio!!!!,Love the player...bought it for my teenager. Simple to use and very satisfied with the price and quality. I'm so glad I found this while searching for ipods on the amazon site. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that my husband thinks the headphones could be a better quality. I think they're great...I highly recommend this player due to ease of use and the fact that it comes with all the accessories ready to go.
4,Great little MP3 player,We are very happy with this product. We've found it to be very easy to download music.
4,Not A Bad Little Gadget!,"I bought this item primarily for working out and riding my bike. It has definitly served its purpose! It's compact, easy to use and comes with some very handy extras such as the case, arm strap and I also appreciate the fact that it comes with an seperate USB cable."
4,Couldnt be happier,"This is my first mp3 and until they change drastically again, it will be my last for awhile. This one covers all my needs and then some. Its small (palm size), light weight, easy to control, works with every downloading service I've wanted to use and sounds great. If you have basic ""I just need some music I can carry easily"" type needs like I did, or for a teenager or first mp3, this is a great purchase. I recommend it highly."
4,"Great combination of style, price and quality",The Xansa series of mp3 players from Sandisk looks really sleak and the music quality is just great. FM reception quality and voice recorder quality are good.Good buy...can also upgrade to 1GB version.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"If you are looking to use this player with audible.com, don't buy it!!I am on my second player (after returning the first to SanDisk) and have experienced the same problems with both players. The player skips pieces of the audio file (it's the same type of ""noise"" you get when talking to someone on the phone and their call-waiting beeps) and when you pause the player or turn it off, it won't begin playing where you stopped. It skips ahead 2-4 minutes. I have no idea how the player works with music files.Don't let SanDisk mislead you--this player is not compatible with audible.com."
3,"great little player but operation is ""iffy"" and ""flakey""","Quite a promising and cute player, and good while it lasted. I had it for about two months before it failed on me (stuck on ""finalizing update"" screen). Digging around for that error I found that way too many people had the same problem - and SanDisk didn't provide any hardware 'reset' functionality in the unit.They could improve their web site by adding some diagnostics so people with Internet can avoid a phone call. I'm now going through the RMA process that seems to be the only way to convert this back from a paperweight."
4,Great mp3 player,This is a great player for the price. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 was because of the earphones that come with it. They are adequate but much better could be purchased to replace them. Great sound from the player.
5,I'll stick with sandisk,"I've had this M230 for over a year and I use it mostly at work listening to audiobooks. I have had no problems with it at all. I have dropped it multiple times and it has gotten lightly wet a few times (4-5) and it still works fine. If I had to list a complaint it would be-the backlight doesn't work when the battery is low-it takes a few seconds too long to power downOther than that, it's awesome. My wife has the 1G model and has had no problems with hers and my daughter also has a different 1G model and has had no problems with it. Sandisk all the way for us, I would def. buy another."
2,MP3 Doesn't work,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. We opened it and tried to get it to work. Followed the directions and it does not power on. We charged it even though it has a battery already, tried to download songs, but no luck. We have tried and tried to get it to power on. If there is a special trick, please let me know. I have a very sad 5 yr old."
1,SanDisk Sansa m230 512 MB MP3 Player (Blue),Very disappointed with performance. Difficult to work with and user unfriendly. Battery dies after very short period of time. Inadequate directions. Instruction set up CD doesn't work with Windows Vista.
4,starter mp3 player,I was a little nervous about getting my first mp3 player but I was very pleased with this one. I wanted to download audio books to listen at work and in the car. The controls are basic and easy to use and it holds two average length books and some music. It connected to my computer fairly easily. I know I am way behind the curve but this was a good place to start.
5,Love it!,"It's very easy to add songs and is great for running. It's very light and small, so it's easy to run with it in your hand (I didn't like the arm strap/holder it came with)."
1,"three months, it's broken.","it doesn't read to the comp anymore, so i can't exchange my music, so everything i have on there is what's gonna stay on there... i thought when i read the other reviews ""naw i can't afford an ipod, and i'm sure it'll be fine"" yeah NOT.just save up some money and get what WORKS!sansa... you SUCK."
5,I love my SanDisk mp3 player,"I am amazed that such quality can come in such a small package and at such a small price. I can get about 12 albums on the half gig of memory. So that I have ready access to my music, I have ripped a number of albums into wma format and I store them on a DVD disk. It is very easy to delete albums from the mp3 player and to drag new ones from the DVD disk through my computer.I would love to have them accessible by folder, rather than album, but what can you expect for under $50.00.I think the ear buds are excellent, as opposed to some reviewers."
3,SanDisk M230 MP3,This MP3 player is an adequate first time player. I bought it as a gift. It was well received. I thought the memory was sufficient but it doesn't hold as many songs as it purports to.
5,SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player (Blue),Great MP3 no problems getting it nor using it. my only complaint would be that it does so much and there wasn't an instruction booklet.
5,"Great value, great product!","Got this for my six year old who just had to have an ipod. This was a very economical and efficient way to fulfill her request. She loves it since it displays the song names, the shuffle does not. Radio option is also great. So easy to use and great sound. Could not have asked for a better deal on a great product. Both mom and daughter are thrilled!"
1,Twice defective,"I bought a San Disk several months ago based on good reviews. Then the power button failed within a few weeks. I wrote it off as a fluke and bought another. On that one, the volume only played at full blast. I'm trying to work with the manufacturer for a return but it is a very convoluted process and I doubt I'll get anything out of it. I would not buy another."
1,SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player (Blue),Never received player.After numerous tries to contact the company. Nothing from them!!!!!
3,Good product for price/features w/notable exception,"I had a need for a low-cost, minimal storage mp3 player and this one does a good job. I downgrade it since I still haven't been able to create a playlist using included, purchased or freeware products. The software that comes with the product forces one to install additional unwanted software and it can't be unbundled. Sandisk website is not helpful nor is the manual."
1,Had to return to the store...twice,"I felt comfortable purchasing this product after all of the good reviews on this site. It did have good sound, but the particular player I purchased kept skipping from song to song after playing only a few seconds. Some songs would play for a few minutes and then skip to the next song, others would only play for five seconds or so. I returned the player to the store and tried another M230. The exact same thing happened again. As I returned this model again, the store clerk privately told me that there had been many returns on this particular model and he advised me to try either Iriver or Samsung. Hopefully it was just a bad batch that had arrived at that particular store, but I won't be purchasing a Sansa again."
5,Small and handy mp3 player,"I absolutely love this player. Its small, easy to transfer files to using windows media player. Transfer of files is a lil slow but then its not something you do everyday. I got it at an absolute steal price from Amazon and am really happy with my choice. Will highly recommend. The in-built FM Radio is a bonus!"
5,My son LOVES this ...,I don't think there is anything better for a kid. He loves his MP3 player and all this time I though he was careless. He never leaves his player laying around! I wish he could feel the same about all his things!
1,Didn't last,"I bought my m230 about one year ago. It worked perfectly until a couple of days ago when it froze. I called SanDisk. They were helpful, but they couldn't fix the problem. Now, I have to throw my m230 in the trash. That is not right."
4,Suitable MP-3 player for the price!,Bought this MP-3 player for my son's 11th birthday. Holds plenty of songs for a young music listener--and it picks up tons of radio stations.
2,Not such a good mp3 player,I have this mp3 player for over a month now I have to say that it is not as good as my previous mp3 player (Sandisk SDMX1). It freezes while playing songs and the navigation through the menues is really slow compared to my older mp3. Don't waste your money on this mp3.
3,"not bad, but could be better","Set-up and loading was easy, but WILL NOT hold 250 WMA songs. The most I could fit was 158, and there was ALOT of memory left.Also, to play Wal-Mart downloads you have to copy from computer to cd, delete from computer, rip from cd back to computer, then transfer to device. Battery life not close to 19 hours if using backlight. For $24 it's not bad, but it should at least live up to claims."
5,Great Product at a Good Price,"Product arrived in timely fashion and worked as advertized. It is time consuming to start listing in intermedite positions in a long file. However, the player usually remembers the position when it is stopped and restarted."
1,SanDisk Sansa M230,"SanDisk MP3 player is very good. Satisfactory regarding the price/benefit. I have bought 2 already, for both daughters.I recommend it if you don't need to load a big ammount of music. It is very fast to load music and create lists."
2,Read This,"I got this for Chirstmas, and it started out great. Then, about 8 months later, it stopped working. I'm planning on getting an iPod insted of this crappy thing."
1,ughhhhh! bad,"Probaly the only great thing about this thing is that it fits in the shape of your grip, Otherwise it is bad. Negatives:the screen is hard to read, the ear phones are very uncomfortable, chep carriying case, takes too long to shut off, bad volume, some times when I'm going through the playlist and I stop on a song, and it starts in the middle of the song, bad radio connection. I'd rather have no mp3 player at all than have this!!!!!!!! If you buy this product BAD CHOICE!!!"
2,waste of time,"reading its features and manual was not difficult, however try uploading music to the sansa mp3 and then you would know about problems. it's supposed to be compatible with windows millenium but guess what?; it's not. i think adding a couple dollars more and purchasing something from apple would have been worth the while.thnks."
1,Dont buy this,"There are alot of things wrong with this MP3 player.1. It takes a very long time to transfer songs into it. It takes about one minute per song.2. When the transfering was finnaly complete it only had the songs under song title and it is suppose to have it listed by Artist, Album, and Genere. It basically works like a slow version of the ipod shuffle.3. The directions suck4. It says that you can have 20 preset radio stations but it does not even tell you how to preset them.5. The stupid instalation cd got stuck into my computer luckily i got it out.I got this because my other mp3 player which i bought cheaply broke after 6 months but i deciede just to stick to my portable cd player which i have had for 2 years it is big and all but atleast it does its job."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I've owned this device since December 2005. If all you want to do is drag and drop mp3 files and play, it is OK for that. But beware! For virtually any other audio use, look elsewhere. For audible.com content the player injects static every minute or so making the listening intolerable. I've been unable to make it work with subscription music services, like Yahoo To Go. Every few days I have to reset the battery to basically cold boot the device as the buttons stop working.Also be aware that this device has two different modes, which I still haven't quite figured out, making it difficult to use on different computers. There is a mp3 file on mine I have never been able to get off because I loaded it from a PC I no longer have access to.Sandisk's technical service is non-existent. Sandisk's website is also useless.My recommendation would be to look elsewhere."
4,Good For Price,"Sound quality is really good. Recordings are excellent. Equalizer works well. My only beef is that it does not record directly off of FM, however other than that it's a definate buy, especially for the price."
4,Perfect for kids!,"Plenty of space for music and easy for my 5 and 7 year olds to use. They had a hard time keeping the ear buds in so I had to buy kids headphones but they love their ""Ipods""!"
2,mediocre,"This is really cute and has great sound. Love the style and color. Easy to use. Doesn't hold much music, though. I'd go for the one with a bigger memory. And, definitely upgrade the headphones. They hurt your ears."
5,Nice for the Price!,"I purchased the Sansa (512MB) player for a hiking trip and I have to say it works GREAT. The only complaint that I would have is that the unit is a bit bulk for todays standards, but not to bad.If you are looking for a no-frills MP3 player than this unit is a great value! Plus it comes in larger memory sizes and a built in radio to boot! The single AAA battery that the unit takes goes a long way too!"
4,nice but cheap,"The player is good, really good. Except that it is buggy. I have had to take the batteries out on 3 occasions in a week to reset the thing because it would lock up. Now all the featues on this thing are all nice. The voice recorder is good the radio Is very good and the interface is simple and fast. the player is also very light. light like you might crush it, not durable light. However the player is a pretty good bang for the buck."
2,Intermittent problems....bad firmware?,"As soon as I received my m230 I began transferring music to it. During the transfers the m230 stopped accepting new songs saying it was full _and_ all of the files I transferred disappeared! When looking at drive properties the m230 shown it was 50% full. I ended up downloading newer firmware for the device which fixed the problem, I thought.A few weeks later when I powered on the device it said ""device full...please remove 4mb"" Again it wouldn't play any music because it said it was empty. When connecting the m230 to my computer it shown the computer was 50% full but there were no files visible!Even worse Sandisk wants you to pay for their RecoverPro software to recover the lost mp3's on the device.Again I ended up fixing the problem again with a newer firmware (2.2.5) that was just released. But how long before this happens again?Too many problems with the m230! Stay away from this device!"
5,Great Deal !!,"Got for my 11 year old granddaughter for her Birthday. I wasn't to sure about the quality do to the low price, but she is only 11 and I wanted to be sure she would use it before I sank to much money into one. Well as it turned out it was a wonderful purchase. She listened to while on a 5 hour trip and batteries are still going strong. In fact her Mother borrowed it since she had a lot of her favorite songs on it also."
4,Haven't been able to part with this since I got it 7 days ago!!!!,"Bought this mp3 player on a whim while waiting in the *LONG* line in the BEST BUY day after Thanksgiving sale. I have been extremely happy with my purchase. I agree w/ the reviewer who said that the instructions were lacking in direction but if you stick with it, the pay off is worth it. For $40 (sale price), you can't beat the sound quality and ease of downloading your favorite tracks. I did have a little trouble downloading my Napster tracks but I eventually figured it out. If you have a little bit of patience, then this is the MP3 for you."
3,"Very slow transfer speed, but easy to work controls and display","I upgraded from the Sandisk Digital Audio Player line to the Sansa line when it broke; I was also hoping to get a faster fast forward. I was unpleasantly surprised that the transfer speed from my hard drive was extremely slow. To transfer 73 MB file (a 90 minute podcast), it took 53 seconds in MTP mode and 40 seconds in MSC mode, compared to just 9 seconds on the older Digital Audio Player. Also, the fast forward, while faster than the older Digital Audio Player, is still not very fast, taking a full 120 seconds to fast forward through 20 minutes of podcast to get to the place where I left off.On the positive side, the display is easy to read and the controls are easy to use. This is very important to me, but not enough to live with the frustration of a slow transfer speed. It's going back to Best Buy."
4,"Great, except....","THis player is great! Nice sound, no skipping, radio with presets, voice recorder. BUT I just wish it had more hard drive space. i have thousands of songs and i wish sandisk would make a 30 gb or 60 gb version"
4,"good functionality, easy to use, very low cost","The SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player is an excellent value. I would definately buy one again.Good:** Extraordinary value for your money** The readout and controls are easy to use and so is the menu** The included earphones are adequate** Drag-and-drop music loading** Haven't replaced the batteries yet . . .Bad:** A little too thick, about the thickness of a small flashlight** No clip. It includes a holder with elastic strap that isn't very comfortable when jogging."
4,Nice little player..,"This was my first mp3 and I'm very happy with it. It's a nice compact size so I can slip it in my pocket and has all the features I need, and more than I expected for something so cheap. I know some have had trouble getting radio reception, but I haven't so far, I've gotten all the stations in our area, one of my favorite features. It has an easy replaceable AAA battery so you don't have to worry about charging it. It was very simple to start using, which was good since this was my first time, and I had it full and ready to go in just a few minutes.I kinda wish it was a 1GB since I've already loaded this one, but for the price and just starting out, the 512MB is just enough. The navigation took me a little bit to figure out, but overall it's pretty simple. It's all sorted into genre, CD, Artist, etc. Very nice.I've been telling my family they should get one to start out with. So far it's been a great buy and I'm very happy with it."
5,Very Satisfied,Very fast delivery product brand new as stated would definatley purchase from this seller again!!
5,joined the in generation,now I can enjoy my music (40's and 50's) without anoying my grandchildren. good product and service.
5,Great Product!!!,"I bought this product in March to use for downhill skiing. I love the armband that comes with it. The one battery lasts forever and I don't have to worry about recharging it and waiting. I have never downloaded music and the program was simple to understand and easy to use. My seven year old daughter love this too. I have no complaints about this product and would highly recommend this to anyone. In fact I am planning to buy another one. I have used it biking, skiing, mowing the lawn, and boating with not a single problem. And I am rough on equipment. This is a must have!!!"
5,Sansa MP3 Review,"This is a wonderful player for the price. It's easy to load and navigate, It comes with a protector that doubles as it's carrying case, earbuds, and a set of starter batteries. I would recommend rechargeable batteries for this product though as it's not rechargable itself and it seems to only last about 12 hours or so on the ""cheap"" batteries. It has a digital readout that's easy to read and you can adjust the contrast to your liking. The website to this product offers support and instructions in case you don't know how to load one of these. Other than that, great product."
5,love this player,I have had fancier mp3 players from i pod shuffle to creative zen stone mosiac but by far this smaller 512 San disk is my favorite player.I do not need a special usb for this one. It's size is perfect for not taking up much room in your pocket or purse. The video screen is easily readable.The fancier ones do not have a you can replace it battery. To me besides the features the fact that is a simple triple a battery is very nice .I did try the shuffle and hate i tunes.Since i already have an extensive mp 3 collection this works very well with drag and drop and change things out when i want to.I ended up getting 5 of these for x mass gifts and got glowing reports on how much easier they are to deal with then other players....If you want something simple to work with your already have collection this is it. Best part is if something happens to it you will not kick yourself forever since the price is great!
4,Great Player,My husband brought me this MP3 playe last year and when I saw it I told him I wanted an IPOD but when I played it....I was like forget the Ipod! this player does the job just fine for me for more than half the price. I liked it so much I brought my husband one for Christmas last year because I was tired of him using my SanDisk Sansa MP3 player! It's a great player.
2,Poor Quality,"I actually ended up throwing this POS out. Poor Quality, wouldnt stay on, Awful Awful Buy."
5,Great value - good product,Works great - have had it well over a year using regularly - works like a champ.
5,Without all the Fancy Stuff,"If you're looking for an MP3 player without all the fancy stuff then this is the MP3 player for you. The Sansa m230 only holds a small amount but it's affordable and it is easy to use with a computer. So putting music on it, and taking it off is quicker and easier than with I-tunes. And you can decide the program you want to use with it."
5,Much better than my old mp3 player.,"One thing I love about this player is that I can skip through songs quickly. With my old player I had to click and wait and click and wait, and it was a HUGE pain."
1,Was good while it worked.,"I did buy it refurbished to be honest. Worked pretty darn good. Then it just did what it wanted, which was not much. Perhaps buying new is better. But if they had to sell it refubished that means new went bad. I would get another brand."
5,Great MP3,"This little inexpensive player is amazing. I listen mostly to the FM radio and the reception is always clear.I have abuses this player for almost 2 years now and it is still going. Bike in the rain, kayak and run. The battery last longer than most.Worth buying. The only negative is wiping it clean to add a new playlist, maybe it's me but it is a pain."
1,Terrible sound,"I had high hopes for this MP3 player, given the overall good reviews, but once my music was synced and I had a chance to listen to it, the sound was just awful. It was all crackles and fuzz. I tried listening with high quality ear phones and that didn't change a thing. I ended up returning it and bought a refurbed ipod for the same price."
3,It's OK,"When I first received this item, it was easy enough to connect to my PC and transfer music files. However, the next time I connected it, the PC didn't recognize the files and it took me awhile to figure out how to fix this problem. Sound quality is hit or miss - some songs sound OK, but others are distorted. Guess you get what you pay for - $25.00."
2,Player failed and was returned,"This player had a software/firmware failure where it would never boot up properly. After a long discussion with Sandisk tech support, they suggest that I return the player and get a refund. This is what I did."
5,Very Pleased!,My son used a gift certificate for this player and it has proved to be a great choice! The player fits in his pocket and the software is very user friendly. This is the first MP3 player anyone in our family has used and we all agree it is a great starter!
4,This little thing is cool...,"I bought this MP3 player for my 9 year old son. It has a couple of quirks - like sometimes it freezes up on us and I have had to pop the battery out to get it re-started. It's really small, lightweight and easy to use. The instruction manual, however, is VERY basic and it's been trial and error figuring out how to download and edit songs. All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with it for the price."
2,Dead after 1 month,"I got this MP3 player for my son for a gift. It worked for 30 days and completely stopped working. I can not find a reset button and technical support at Sandisk is non-existent. (I did get the white one, however, not the blue one) I ended up buying him the Insignia which has been working much better and has much better sound. What a disappointment. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because I got my daughter the same one which is still working, but the sound is awful"
3,Works but not for what I wanted,I bought this mp3 player to have the option of listening to the radio - FM stations are all static- anyone else have this problem? assuming you can't fix this? static where I usually never have a problem. The mp3 part works fine- seems the personalized playlist set up is more complicated than on an ipod. Automatically sets up lists by Artist and Album. But if anyone is wondering- this works fine with the MAC. Looks much better if you get the jelly case that they sell. Easy to use- if you are concerned it is complicated- it is not. I will probably give away but it is what it is...
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this product. I liked the size and the way it looks, but was unable to download music that would play onto it. I tried iTunes, Windows Media Player, and AT&T Yahoo Music. Occasionally, a playlist would download, and I would get a message that the songs were downloading, but when I tried to access the music, I received a message sahying ""No Files"". I spent 3 hours (or more) looking up online help, looking at the included CD, just randomly trying what works on my iPod, but to no avail. I became so frustrated, I returned the product and bought an iPod Shuffle. This was a gift for my 11 year old nephew and I was looking forward to it based on the reviews I had read. Perhaps I just had a bad unit (though the voice record and FM radio worked), but I would not recommend this product."
5,SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player,"The MP3 plyer is great. Easy to operate. Just as good as an Ipod, but without the price!!! My son is really enjoying it."
4,Good mp3 player,"Have a good sound, is easily to use, but the FM radio don't have a very good reception"
4,Good little mp3 player for the money,"Small, light, appears durable. And only $35 on Amazon. Perfect for my 7 year old. Loaded easy, nice little screen and easy to navigate menu. My 7 year old had it figured out in 10 minutes. A good purchase."
4,Works great for a great price,"Except for the two problems mentioned below All 3 of the units I purchased hav worked very well: the sound is good, it is extremely easy to use, the display is easily read. My 10 year old uses it easily and my eight year uses his but doesnt quite manipulate all the menu options yet.Two problems I have are:Doesnt store as many songs as it claims, we were able to store only about 90 songs.Occasionally you get an errror message that requires you to sync it with the computer to keep using the songs and it wont play until you get it done."
3,"Nice, but cheap","I got this MP3 player because I thought they looked neat and had nice features, big mistake. The blue paint started to chip the first few weeks I had it, then dirt got under the plastic cover and it began to get really gross. One day I wen to pick it up and the screen was cracked underneath and it would not turn on.It's a nice design and the features like the radio and how easy it is to select the music you want. You can select a certain, author, CD, or genre. It's really nice feature wise except for the fact that it can't play movies.It also turns on really easily if left in a bag or backpack since the button is one the outside and really easy to press.I wouldn't buy another and would not suggest it. It's really cheaply made and not worth the money."
1,It Sucked,"I wanted something inexpensive for work purposes, when the product was delivered, it looked just fine for what I needed. I put the battery in, and nothing worked. So I went through a bunch of bullcrap. To make a long story short, I payed almost $24.00 to recieve this item,sending it back cost me another $5.00, and they decided to refund me $14.40 for a piece of junk that I never even got to listen to. So all together it cost me $15.00 to write a review for nothing but a hard time. I suggest you don't waste your time on this item, or money."
5,Very Pleased!,"This product is very simple, convenient, and easy to use. I'm very pleased with this product."
2,Firmware problems,firmware problems with update software that's more difficult than average to apply should not occur in an item this simple
4,Great with the armband,"I've been using the Sansa now for a little over a year, mostly while I'm out riding a bike using the armband. I've worn it in the pouring rain on more than one occasion and it survived in addition to being hit with heat, cold and/or sweat. I use it for listening to the radio, music or occasionally audiobooks. The *only* think I wish I could figure out is how to fast forward within a track (very helpful for long audiobook tracks). Other than that, I totally love it."
2,Less than a year of light use and it died,For the price I did not expect superior sound quality or elegance of operation and I was right. But I did expect the device to hold up to light usage for more than a year. I bought it in July 2007 and it died in March of 2008 - not acceptable.
3,MP3 Radio/Download Song player,"The Sansa is a small, reliable radio and personal song MP3 player. It is practically weightless too. The only couple of matters I did not care for from this product was that the earbuds for the headset were a bit too large for my ears. I had to purchase a different style and size to have the headset fit my ears and it runs on 1 triple A battery which, the company product innovater says that one gets about 19 hours of play, but with my experience, it is less time than this."
4,Works Great!!,"I purchased this product mainly for the radio tuner to use at the gym. They have tvs that use the radio stations, in order to listen to them. The signal is great in the gym, don't have any problems there. It does drain the battery a little fast but I use rechargeable batteries. It has enough space to save several songs to listen to while working out."
2,"Ah, so so","Honestly, you get what you pay for. From the minute I got this thing in the mail, I loaded it up with music, put new batteries in and was ready to go. Unfortunatly, the device was not. I had to keep playing with the battery to get it to turn on. When it did finally turn on, I listened for a bit and put it on pause.....when I did that, it shut off and once again, I was playing with the battery to get it to work. I've tried Energizer Lithium batteries and Duracell thinking maybe it was the battery but sad to say, it wasn't. Like I said, you get what you pay for...what do you expect for 20 bucks? lol. When it wants to work, it is great....but those with little or no patience are urged to stay away from this device."
3,"good, but not perfect","bought this so i could be anti-Ipod... overall i'm pleased with it, but it could stand improvements. things i like about it:1. lightweight2. runs on a single AAA battery, so i can always carry spares3. decent price for the memorymy gripes:1. i still can't get my ID3 tags to display properly2. playlist support is not intuitive3. i only get ~15 hours of playtime on a battery - not bad, but not what's advertisedoverall, it's a decent mp3 player for those on a budget. you do, however, get what you pay for."
5,GREAT--SO FAR!,"This is a really great, little mp3 player--though I've only had it for a week (so it may break down later...). FM radio works great, like any other FM radio you buy at the store. Voice recorder works great (at least for the 10 seconds I tried). Downloading music WAS SO EASY AND FAST!!!This was my first mp3 player, and I can say I made a great choice buying this! This is probably the best mp3 player in the market at such an affordable price. Only thing I'm finding a bit annoying is that I can't delete songs or recording right on the player...will probably have to hook it up to the computer to do that. Otherwise this is an EXCELLENT product and I would recommend it to everyone!Edit: actually can't hold that many songs. about 80 songs for me. and my earbuds have stopped working."
4,A good mp3 player with an incredible price,"I bought this mp3 player last year and till now, I'm still satisfied with its function. It can play music, radio, and record. Most importantly, it's cheap!"
3,San Disk Sansa M230 512 MB,"I am over 70 and this is my first MP3 player. I have totally enjoyed the songs which I have downloaded to my Sansa M230. Clarity is exceptional. I also enjoy the FM radio which is able to pick up quite a few stations. I do not care for the earphones; they will not stay in place. And the buttons are very small and difficult to operate; however, I suspect that much of this problem is due to my age."
4,Love this little thing!,"This is a great little MP3 player, nice and small and the buttons aren't overly sensitive like my last MP3 player. I also love the built in FM radio feature."
4,Nice and Compact...,"This is a great MP3 player for the cost, but the only con that I have is the armband for working out. It is not very sturdy and doesn't have an actual pocket for the player on the armband, making it uncomfortable. It doesn't look like they have any other arm bands available to purchase for this. Other than that, very pleased."
2,Poor customer service at SanDisk,"Buyers BEWARE of doing business with SanDisk.....The MP3 player is great and easy to download on. Very easy to use, even though no directions are given in the package. My complaint is with SanDisk themselves. My MP3 player arrived in a sealed and non-damamged package- however the headphones had a short in them. You could only get music from the right ear. I registered the product with SanDisk and asked for them to please send a pair of replacement earphones. I was sent a response from them stating they would try to accomodate me, but the next time that I damage or lose an item- I would have to go to the local electronics store. The headphones are evidently poor quality and it is a shame that the company will not stand behind their product and then accuses people of damaging or losing items vs. admitting their headphones stink. I will not do any business with SanDisk in the future, as I now see how they treat their customers."
5,Serves my purpose,I have two of these type. I like the fact that you add aaa battery. This works for me as I travel and a pc is not available for charging. I have the other type but for travel and just leaving in the car for occasional use these fit my bill!!!!
4,best one I ever had,"This was my first mp3 player and lasted me for 4-5 years before I sat on it and broke the screen. It only held 125 songs, and wasn't super pretty, but it played great, displayed the music info, and even had radio and recorder built in. I have only been able to find one, the Raven, that was almost as convenient and long lasting."
1,Piece of Garbage,This thing was nothing but trouble from the get go. Accepts files and then says that there isn't enough memory for music files. The thing is just junk. Save your money.
4,"Cheap, basic, great sound.","Bought 4 of these for me and my kids 3 and a half years ago. They are very basic but have great sound quality. Battery life could be better but not too bad. Just a couple months ago two of our units finally started to have problems when connecting through USB. One was left frozen, the other eventually worked out. My kids have loved them and used them a ton. I paid $22 each three years ago. Remarkably they are more expensive now for some reason. They have taken lots of abuse so for only one of four to be out of commission three and a half years later, I'd say that is a win.I am replacing them with new Sandisk 4 Gig Fuze Video MP3 players with accessories and an additional 4 Gig Micro SDHC card for about $65 total each. Sandisk has been great for us so I am staying with them."
2,Disappointing...,"I received this mp3 player as a gift and was very excited. It was small, portable, and had many handy features. The big issue was that it runs on batteries. Well, it DID run on batteries until it broke and wouldn't run anymore. For some reason, the programing on it corrupted. I would not recommend getting this version of the SanDisk Sansa. After talking with a few other people who owned this same player, they also said they had problems with it and ended up buying something else. I would most recommend upgrading to the 1 GB version of the Sandisk Sansa."
4,still a good player,holds up to 84 songs and continue to last but is not water resisted so keep away from the rain.
4,Great little mp3 player,"I bought this mp3 player to go running and exercise with. You can fit approx. 3-4 cds on it, which is more than enough for an hour or so at the gym. This little mp3 gives off great sound, takes batteries, and is really light weight. It is easy to see and figit with. The buttons are so accessible that I can even change songs when I am running.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't come with an armband... at least the version I purchased. I had to buy a separate armband that didn't quite fit is and made it difficult to use.Other than that it is a great product and I recommend it."
4,Good little player/recorder,"This is my 2nd SanDisk 512. It has a good headphone connector, where others got loose.Recording is excellent, especially if you get some free audio editing software to cut the clipping and amplify the person furthest from the mike.Only drawback is that one cannot select ALBUMS or other ways to find a file except by the toggle switch, which is tolerable, but a bit annoying when files do not load in sequence onto the player. Nicer to be able to play by album or somehow, in sequence, when they do not write to the device in sequence.Otherwise, it is a good player and why I got a second one instead of another brand or a bigger capacity."
5,Review,My first try at an MP3 player. It is not intuitive to work the controls but fooling around will get it working. The instuction CD is small and will only fit on a player with a center post. I found one on a laptop I have but other then that it would have been useless for me.
1,horrible,This product is junk!! I bought one of these for my husband and then decided that I would like one too...they are both broken now. They work great for about a month or so and then they just start acting funny and die. I ended up purchasing an apple shuffle for my husband and it works great. I would not purchase this product!
2,Faulty players...,"I am hoping that people read this and take this into consideration before dismissing me as an idiot who isn't tech-savvy.I bought the Sansa M230 after reading a ton of great comments about it. However, my complaint isn't that I can't figure out how to turn the player on or off, that the buttons are ""too small"", that I can't find a place to download music, or that the player is ugly.Rather, I am sad to say that my player locks up when shuffling rapidly through the song database. It seems that it frequently freezes up and that I have to remove the battery in order to restart it. It really sucks to have to pop out your battery while running on the treadmill. Everything else is good though. You're rolling the dice on this one guys!"
5,it's waterproof!,It went through the washing machine all the way through to spin and still worked (new headphones were required). What more can I say?
5,Great MP3 Player,This MP3 player is so simple to use!!! Just plug it into your USB port on your computer and drag and drop the songs. No special software needed. The stored songs can also be played back through the computer if you like.The FM tuner works really well for such an inexpensive player.This one was bought for a Mother's Day gift but I am thinking of getting me one also.
4,It takes an effort to make the device work,i had some problems before i got the player to work.i didn't know how to turn the player on. the short manual was not very good.i had to go to the web to find the sansa manual that told me to press and hold the power button until it starts.i also couldn't sync it with the usb until i found a note that someeone wrote about turning the power off and locking the device before connecting the usb. this fixed the usb connection and i was able to transfer the music files to the device.the player really is very good once it works. i have an apple ipod and i was getting fustrated with the battery life on the device. the battery will die at the worst time. that was the reason i decided to purchase a music player that uses batteries. i always carry a spare battery just in case the current battery dies.i am still trying to learn how to use all the features on the player. i am just a little dissappointed that i have to do some much work to make the player ready.
1,I Feel Like Amateurs Made This Thing,"Save your money and get an iPod. The only reason I got it was that I switched to a MacBook Pro and could not download WMA-formatted audiobooks from my local library unless I used my old PC. Not wanting to spend the money on another iPod, I bought this thing, and it is awful. First, the battery that came with it was dead. Then-- worst of all-- the thing cannot hold its place on a track longer than 30 minutes. So, if you are half way through an hour-long track and pause it you have to start over! Just awful."
4,"Nice Size, Nice Price, Great Quality","At first when I bought this cute little mp3 player, I really thought I'd have it no longer than a few months. However, the quality is great and the battery life is outstanding. The ear buds are amazing and can compete with any other headphones I have in my collection. I tried out the iRiver H10 with 40GB and it was too huge and although it could hold alot of songs, it was too time consuming going through all of them. This play now (the Sansa) is just right. I put all of my favs on it and just go. It syncs effortlessly and comes with a nice little case so your screen wont be scratched and you can run with it. I honestly toss it in my purse everyday and it still works fine. I would seriously suggest buying this if you're looking for a cost efficient device with more features than the oh-so-famous iPod. Oh yeah and the bass is great too and the volume is serious on this tiny little gadget."
5,so far so good!,bought it at rite aid during their 3 day thanksgiving sale for my dad for a christmas present. i downloaded songs on it so that when he opens it on christmas day he will already have some music to listen to. holds alot of music! it was really user friendly and adapted to the standard windows media player instantly. no programs! no hassle! and it takes not even a few minutes to fill it up. GOOD BUY!! love the screen that tells you what you are listening to. the sound quality is also great. wish i would have waited for these to come out before i bought my ipod shuffle.
4,Great MP3 player for the price...would buy again.,"This MP3 player was purchased as a present for my husband. I myself already own one, a RCA LYRA and though I like it the darn thing sucks down batteries like nobodies buisness. The SanDisk isn't like that. It's been playing on the same battery for over four days now. The only problem I have with this player is that the back of it (the tab that holds the battery in) is loose. It often flops out like the latch is broke only it isn't. Weird. Either way this hiccup is not enough to make me sing anything other then praises. If your looking to buy an inexspensive, large MB MP3 player a SanDisk Sansa is the way to go. If and when mine dies I'll be buying this brand for sure!!!"
1,you get what you pay for,I bought this based on several good reviews. (there were also some bad ones). I guess I got one of the bad ones. It arrived in a timely manner and well packaged with no damage. I put a new battery in it and nothing. Put in another new battery (checked them with a volt meter) also nothing. Tried one more and still nothing. At that point I packaged it up and sent it back. I'am now shopping for a low priced mp3 that works. Glad I bought it from amazon because of there great return policy.
4,Worth the money,This product is simple to use and good value - I would recommend this product but do not bother to try the free trial with Rhapsody that comes with it - way more trouble than it is worth.
4,Good Product,"This is a great music player for my 13 yr. old. It has taken a beating and is still going, sounds good, and is simple but does everything even I would need in a MP3 player. Good product if you are looking for something simple."
4,A Great Little Device,"I am not an expert with this type of technology, yet the SanDisk Sansa M230 is easy to use and works very well. The most difficult time I had was figuring out how to mark songs as favorites. The directions were not very good. Other than that, this is great for the price."
1,Already broken?,"This review is limited to the battery compartment. My daughter took out the screw to open it, and now it won't screw back in. Pretty disappointing."
3,mp3 player,"i got this mp3 player for my daughter, she really enjoys it to the fulliest extent allowed, i am glad i was able to get this for her"
1,Not Good,"The item we got was nice at first, But it broke in just a few weeks, it really is a bummer when you think your getting a good deal, and then a few weeks later the thing breaks!!!"
5,very good cheap simple player,I bought this for my dad - I found it to have a very simple interface that he should have no problem using. The price is great and he'll be able to fit pleanty of his songs on here. The FM radio is a big plus too!
4,Great musical bang for the buck,"I bought this MP3 player on Amazon for about $28 - needed something for when I was on the treadmill, and I've found it to be great. I'm not a musician or a music maven that needs thousands of songs on my MP3 player - the 150 (.wma format)or so that mine seems to hold suit me fine. My only problems were with the headphones, which expired fairly quickly, and the fact that it didn't come with a manual (found that online easily enough). I am quite happy with this purchase - good value for the money."
3,a gift,I bought this item for my Grandchild's twelth birthday thinking it was less expensive than an iPod and was something easily programed. It turned out to be more difficult than we expected and even though the twelve year old loved it I feel an iPod might have been a better choice
2,No USB port,"It may have been my mistake, but when the ads say that this works with virtually all printers and it is becoming increasingly common that home printers come with a USB connection, why not make it clear that this will not work with those printers? I recently purchased two printers, an HP 6110 and a Samsung ML-1710, and both use USB connections and thus neither work with this device."
1,Not appropriate for workgroup or corporate environment,"I have 2 of these in my K-12 school and they need to be reset on a regular basis, causing teachers and me much frustration. I have had better luck with HP wireless print servers, but they aren't flawless either."
2,OK Product - Useless manual,"This product works fine - but don't expect to get it going without an hour on hold to technical support. The manual leaves a lot to be desired - there are several key steps in the set up that are completely missed. Tech support was fine, after the wait."
2,Not so easy to set up,"Unlike most Linksys products that I'm fond of, the printserver was difficult to set up. Once configured, it worked as advertised, but as a person significantly more experienced with Wi-Fi than the average consumer, I was disappointed by how much networking knowledge was required.Also, it's important to know that each computer from which you intend to print, must have a new Linksys software driver installed. Once installed, you must run a configuration routine to handshake with the printserver (on each computer). I happen to also have an Adobe Distiller print driver installed on one of my Windows XP laptops, and it rendered it inoperable.I will still use the Linksys printserver because the alternative of running cable is not a pleasant one, but be prepared to spend some time setting it up. Better yet, find a knowledgable friend and ask them for help."
4,"Good product, bad manual",Here's what I did to make it work in 6 easy steps!:1. Hook up the server to the printer. Make sure it prints (press the reset button for 2 seconds)2. Access the server directly first w/o wireless - http://192.168.1.783. Set the domain name to match your domain name in your network. Most home PCs are set to WORKGROUP. (Advanced->NetBUI->Domain Name)4. Connect to the printer: Start->Run->\\ServerName\\PrinterName. Mine is set to something like: \\SC0C65E4\P15. It will ask you to install the drivers for your PC. Install them.6. Print out a test page. You're done!
1,Nothing but trouble. Returned,"First, I am a network manager with loads of experience. Instructions for installation were poor and confusing. You must install and configure in a total wired network. Get is working and configure the wireless section (not very good instruction here). Then, power down, disconnect the cable from the linksys and power up.Never worked. Spent over an hour on the phone with linksys tech support. Did everything 5 times from at least 8 different angles. Didn't work. Linksys said return for a replacement. Not me, I'm returning for a refund. Steer clear of this."
3,Hardly plug-and-play,"I finally got this to work on my wireless network. My entire network is Linksys and until I bought this server I had been mighty impressed with the easy set up of most Linksys products. Not so here. I'm a professional network analyst and I still had major hassles getting this thing to work. It finally does, albeit without WEP. After all the hassles so far just to get it working, I'm not sure if I want to risk messing it up by setting up WEP. Beginners or non-experts should look elsewhere."
4,Easier than it looks,If you are using DHCP on your router than this is a snap... If not turn it on to assign an IP address and change it back after the print server has one. I have done more than one installation of this product and I found that having DHCP assign an IP address was the easiest way to get this thing working. Once it has an IP within your network it is much easier to work with.
1,Paperweight...,"It was advertised as being a decent little print server for the money... but I can't for the life of me get it working with a standard laserjet printer. Software is riddled with errors (lots of error codes) and when you can get it to find the print server, it can't ever find any attached printers. Let me add that the instructions mandate that the printer AND the print server need to be HARD WIRED via LAN to the router during install... a point not advertised. Kind of hard when you have a large, heavy printer on one end of the house and a router on the opposite side of the house. Product itself is crap... with more than ten years of networking experience, I can't figure it out... but the company was great in standing by me and issuing a refund on the order. For that, I'll definitely order from them again.... just not THIS product."
1,hit or miss,"I ordered the Linksys Wireless PrintServer (WPS11) along with the 4 port router (BEFW11S4) and wireless network card (WPC11). The router and wireless card were easy to setup and work great, but I've had nothing but problems with the print server. After spending 90 minutes on the phone with Linksys support (very helpful and they tried very hard to help set it up) I was told the printserver was defective and to return it. I recently received the replacement and once again received another defective item. As I said previously the router and wireless card work great, and the tech support at Linksys spent a considerable amount of time on the phone with me trying to get the items to work, but I'm 0 for 2 with the print server. Looking back I would have probably purchased a router/printserver combo.I hope this helps."
1,"Bug ridden, and poorly designed.","Troublesome from the very start, it has two ways to do setup, one is web based, and one is a setup client.This product is so poorly made, there are actually settings in the client program that are reversed in the web setup. (Netmask and gateway are reversed.)The online help is useless. If you try to use their support pages, they take you to the support pages for a previously released product. Worse still, they refer to features and settings that this product doesn't even have. (DIP switches!)Don't bother with this one.... get a real print server. If it has to be connected to your network wirelessly, just buy a wireless bridge and a small network switch."
1,not compatible,"Normally, I love Lynksys products, but after trying to install this myself and it not working on either of my computers I broke down and called techincal support. After 3 hours with them, and three different tech people I was told (even though it could find my printer on the server, it still wouldn't print anything) that the print server was incompatible with my hp printer. I was told i'd have to buy a new printer. Saver yourself the money on this linksys wireless print server and buy a wireless printer instead, it's much cheaper and just not worth the hassle."
2,Very poor documentation,"Finally got it to work in all Linksys network, but don't try to get it to work with other vendors' wireless products!"
3,I gave it a 3 for Maybe - See other reviews,"I did not buy the B unit, but I did buy the WP11 and it was just an awful experience. Before buying this unit, check with others users to make sure your not asking for trouble."
1,"Poor instructions, won't configure..going in the trash!!","I have a Linksys wireless network with 3 computers and a cable modem/router. The WAP's were easy to set-up and work very good. HOWEVER, this WSP11 is BAD NEWS. After reseting the unit 3 times I was finally able see in on the network in the admin tool, however after that one time, it was gone for good. The instructions are confusing and complicated. I can run a cable faster than the set-up time required for this device. I do not recommend."
1,Lousy tech support and poor documentation,"First off, this item doesn't work with multi function machines. This minor fact isn't shown anywhere on Amazon.com, and was only revealed to me by Linksys after pulling my hair out for an hour trying to set it up on my own, and then another hour going through all sorts of things with one of their...techs. Finally, the jerk asked about the printer, and when I told him it was an HP 4 in 1 laser machine, he said the two won't work together. Fortunately he wasn't nearby because I could have choked him!"
1,Not Wireless,I just got off the phone with tech support. The person told me that this could not be used as a wireless print server?! I was trying to connect this to the Wireless Access Point (BEFW11S4) as shown in the documentation that comes with the product. Don't buy this for the technical support.
1,Incredibly Frustrating Product,"As a prelude, let me say that this product may be quite good once it is configured and running properly. That said, I spent hours, and subsequently I had my IT department spend days, trying to get it to work. The best we could do was have it work intermittently. We were using Cisco and 3Com basestations with WEP on and off in two different physical environments that each had successful wireless LANs up and running.Linksys help support is borderline abusive. Once they heard I was not using a Linksys basestation, they immediately dismissed all the problems and advised that I return the product. Now I can only hope that Amazon does the right thing and returns my money. Caveat emptor. And Linksys, if you are listening, many a company has faltered due to crappy help support."
2,Wow - what a frustrating experience,"I just purchased one of these - thinking it would be easy to install much like the Linksys Router and separate Wireless Access Point/Router that I had purchased previously.To date, I have not been successful in making this thing work with my network. On top of it, this unit has an annoying high-frequency tone (defective?). The instructions are totally useless and using instinctive steps doesn't really get you anywhere. It sounds like from reading other reviews that this unit has trouble establishing an IP, I will attempt to force an IP using my DHCP settings. If that does not work, I will have to get assistance from one of those ""helpful"" phone tech support folks at Linksys.I am not sure this product is ready for prime time!"
2,Not working with all the printers,I have a Canon BJC 5100 but he will not work with this printer driver. Linksys confirms me that 'he is not on the list of tested printers'. THis list is only internal availibleErik-Jan
2,Printer Alert,"Just to save many of you time, I found out via Linksys tech support that this product does not support multi task printers (fax, scan, printer, copier)."
1,A new low for Mayer,"I had not been excited by the first several books of this series and would not have bought another one, but this one was available for free, so I decided to give it a shot.The primary benefit to me from reading this book is that I now know I am not interested in any more books from this series. This book essentially started out nowhere and went nowhere. There was really nothing going on except adapting some historical events into the book's framework.I like a number of Mayer's other books and will continue to read them, but I almost didn't even bother finishing this one -- and the end was a dud as far as I am concerned."
4,Good Book,"While I enjoyed the book, it was a little ""science fiction"" to what I expected. Still enjoyed it and still have anotherr of his Area 51 Series to read."
5,welll worth the read,"I read the whole series...I wish it was made into a movie...2 thumbs up..go for it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,truly legendary,"As always the Amazon's complete list of the Area 51 ""series"" from Mayer and Doherty, is non stop whichever one you read, and so very difficult to put down. LEGEND answers questions from all the others, and asks a few more.Great Reading, waiting for more."
5,Great series,"If you enjoy military and sci-fi then you need to read the Area 51 series. You can tell the author wasn't kidding when he says he is ex Special Forces by the correct military details and descriptions he provides throughout the book. All of the Area 51 books are nonstop page turners and are a great in-depth story line with a perfect ending. I highly recommend starting with his first book, Area51 and then move through the series so you understand the characters and the overall objective they are trying to reach. The books can be read out of order and still make complete sense but for the max enjoyment start at the beginning."
4,Area 51: Legend,"EXTREMELY INTERESTING. MR. DOHERTY'S ENTIRE AREA 51 SERIES HAS HELD ME IN THRALL. THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE ""STARGATE"" TV SERIES, IN THAT ALIENS HAVE GUIDED VARIOUS WORLDS. I HOPE HE CONTINUES THIS SERIES, BUT HIS ATLANTIS SERIES IS ALSO VERY GOOD!"
1,What a drag!,I made it just past two thirds of the book... I do not know if I can finish it... It is sooooooooooooo boring!!!! I will never buy books by this author again. It was the first and the last one.
3,"Acquired taste, indeed","This new collection features ten stories of idiosyncratic characters in exotic locales, from Alaska to Tunisia. Porter weaves interesting observations about life into the eloquent and sometimes lackluster tales that fill this collection. His opaque style defies the reader to connect with the characters, but luckily in the final two stories (""Scrupulous Amédée"" and ""Touch Wood"") the clouds part and the reader is invited into a cozy space. ""Touch Wood : Short Stories"" is a well-written short story collection that may not gain a wide audience, but for those who do connect with it, there is much to appreciate and upon which to reflect."
3,Something More is Needed...,"This cd has all the makings of being a great one. However, I feel the lead singer is holding back his voice too much. In many of the songs, I noticed if you turn up the music loud in a system you can barely hear his voice. I feel one thing that needs to be done is he needs to show more emotion in his words and use his ""screaming voice"" to his advantage. The song that really jumped out to me on the previous album was ""Over"", and this is because he used his powerful voice to display emotion. Many of the songs on this album are very powerful instrumentally, but the voice in many cases just doesn't match the music.There are some good songs on this cd, but it seems to get more boring as you move on from track to track. Most Evans Blue fans will like this album, but more needs to happen with this band if they really want to make it big..."
4,Disappointing but still worth the buy,"Easy to say disappointing cause their debut was amazing so it would have been hard to top that, but still a good rock album with only a few bad tracks so definately worth the purchase. I look forward to whatever these guys do in the future, hopefully they won't rush the next one."
4,One Word.....Awesome!,"I have to admit. I had my doubts about this album. Usually when a band releases their second cd so soon after their first, it turns out to sound rushed and have no good songs on there. But Evans Blue really surpised me. One reviewer on here said that the lyrics are like poetry and I couldnt agree more. The songs are incredibly catchy, especially Q, In A Red Dress and Alone, and Dear Lucid. Is it as good as The Melody and the Energetic Nature of Volume? No. But that shouldnt stop you from picking this cd up. You wont regret it...trust me. So what are you waiting for? Get up and go get this!"
3,"Good, but definitely not great","I keep listening to the songs, hoping that I'm missing something. Evans Blue has a cool sound, and a lot of potential. Unfortunately that potential seems to be largely unrealized in their songs. They seem to be trying to incorporate the best aspects of several sub-genres of rock (an excellent idea) but not doing it as well as, for instance, Fair to Midland. In addition, the songs on this album are generally not as good as ones from their debut. Sigh..."
5,Don't Just Mouse Click -- Buy It!,"The professional reviews that call this the best rock Christmas album ever are on the mark. Don't hesitate. If you aren't in the Christmas spirit yet, this will help get you there. I not only bought a copy for myself, I bought additional copies for friends."
5,"Even if you hate x-mas music, this is a masterpiece!","First off let me say if you only own one x-mas cd it has to be this one. So we all know Phil Spector is a little crazy, but who cares! This album is absolutely fabulous. It creates a timeless mood for the holidays that cannot and will not ever be matched. Like I said in the title it is amazing how these traditional christmas songs can be made so enjoyable. There are only two thing I look forward to every holiday season. I feel terrible saying this, but those two things are not family and gifts. They are this classic album and National Lampoons Christmas Vacation!"
5,Great Album and worth the money,This album has some Awesome Christmas classics on it. I would definately recommend it to any Christmas enthusiast. Every song is a good song and they are the ones that you hear on the radio during the Christmas season.
5,Wonderful Christmas CD,"This is my *favorite* Christmas CD full of Christmas classics done in pop style from the 1960s. It's perfect to have on hand for Christmas get-togethers and for listening to in the car during the holidays.It includes Ronni Spector's classic version of ""Frosty the Snowman"" and a really great song called ""The Bells of St. Mary's.""(My second favorite Christmas CD, which I am sure is also available for purchase on Amazon, is the ""Now that's what I call christmas"" compilation with Jingle Bell Rock, So This Is Christmas (John Lennon) Simply Having a Wonderful Christmastime, Little St. Nick, and many other cool Christmas songs.)"
5,A Christmas Gift for You-and you-and you-and you,"It took me one year to find this CD after watching Darlene Love on Letterman December of 2003. I ordered one CD for my brother who has 3 girls ages 5-13 and took another CD to work. We couldn't wait until the day AFTER Thanksgiving: we cranked it up the day BEFORE Thanksgiving! THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SING-ALONG. You simply cannot have a ""blue, blu-u-u-e XMAS"" listening to this CD."
5,It really is the best,I grew up listening to the record & this was the first CD my family bough...long before we even had our first CD player. Every song on here is perfectly performed. Its amazing. I cant wait to have children so they can enjoy it as much as I have.
5,A Trip Down Memory Lane,"During the holidays, I hear some of these songs on the radio and just love 'em, especially by The Ronettes. I just didn't see them in stores, even with the oldies and figured that even though radio stations play them, they have archives and these songs were out of production. Well man, was I ever happy to find this album...brings back muchos memories. One more thing...delivery was very fast."
5,Possibly the greatest Christmas album of our time,"Phil Spector has his problems, but he was a brilliant producer and mentor and this album is a must for any Christmas collection."
2,Amazon lies about encoding BIT RATE it's not 256 kbps - more like 128 kbps,Buyer beware Amazon lies about the bit rate of this album it's only around 128 kbps variable bit rate. Not 256 kbps. The quality is not great for the phil spector type of sound. So i'd say watch out.
2,A Christmas Gift For You from Phil Spector,The quality of CD is not as good as my other Cds. It plays but has some error problems advancing from tract to tract at times. The CD seems more flimsy than other CDs that I have. The music quality is good.
4,pure classic,"you can and should add this collection to your holiday music traditions. Captures an era and genre in a good way, for all to enjoy."
5,Classic,"As overused as the word ""classic"" might be, it's really apt here. After 35 years, ""A Christmas Gift for You"" remains THE rock 'n' roll Christmas album. Darlene Love's ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"" is the greatest among the great -- perhaps the most monumental rock vocal performance ever committed to tape."
4,The Best Christmas Album ever Produced,A perfect album in every respect.I've never been a huge fan of Christmas music but this album has artistic merit.
3,needs remastering from original 3-track master!,"I agree with ""Hear it in Stereo"" - this album is listenable ONLY in its STEREO form, in which all releases between 1973 through 1984 were issued. The current mushy mono version is like listening underwater! It is plainly BAD-SOUNDING! I know with the current technical state-of-the-art that the Rhino engineers could have gone back to the original 3-track master tape, and come-up with a smashing stereo release with sparkling trebles and clear sound. The fact they did not, speaks to me of ""quick-and-dirty"" marketing. What a disappointment. I will stick with my stereo original LP."
4,Classic Christmas,This is great listening music for Christmas....It's a must have for your collection...Thanks
5,Great Christmas CD,"I love this CD. Great Christmas music. It's just a fun CD, it brings you back when times were different and simple. A must have for the holidays...trust me."
5,Great in mono,"My copy of Sony's remaster of this Xmas classic arrived today. I have to say, this 2009 remaster from Sony is the best it's EVER sounded. My previous CD issue from the early 90s 'Back To Mono' box set is very flat-sounding compared to this new version.As for a previous poster's complaint that it's not in stereo, thank goodness for that! I have the stereo LP issue of this classic album and it definitely loses impact in that format. As Spector himself recognised, his 'Wall Of Sound' relied on one huge conglomeration of sound coming out of both speakers. With stereo separation of the individual instruments into separate channels, the Spector 'Wall of Sound' is effectively halved. The stereo mix is clearer, no arguments there, however in doing so, it destroys the very thing that Spector's original mono mix set out to achieve and succeeded in doing. So cats - go for it - Out with your old copies and replace them with this sparkling new version of one of the greatest Xmas albums of all time."
5,"Gran Trio, representante de la musica colombiana","Este trio, ganador del Concurso Nacional de Serenatas, del Premio Nacional del Bambuco, Ganador del Mejor Trio Colombiano, es uno de los mejores ejemplos de la nueva generacion de musica colombiana. En este disco, dedicado a Hector Ochoa, no solo hacen gala de su virtuosisimo, sino tambien nos enseñan algunas canciones no tan conocidas del Maestro Ochoa, descubriendo un faceta mas de su genialidad. Si quieren conocer algo mas de la musica andina de Colombia, este disco es fundamental"
3,Assembly fun but little long term play value,"My 7 year old son get this set for Christmas. He enjoyed putting it together, but once assembled he has not played with it. He loves the regular Bionicle action figures, but the play set was a waste of money."
3,Typical Bionicle,"My 10 year old enjoys Bionicle's and this was a great addition to his collection. It is typical of this line for durability, style etc. If you like this series this works well it has a mixture of regular legos also for those who like both."
3,no instructions,a great set for the average lego buyer if thats you disregard this and read another review. This is for expirenced lego buyers. The alternate model on the back is not makeable due to the lack of instructions. the instructions are not on any websites as of now either.
3,Best of the Three I did read. Will not buy anymore.,I have definately been spoiled by the Vince Flynn Series. I could not write fiction this good but I will not read anymore
5,Crochet Heaven!!!!,"I adore this spiral-bound book which is chock full of all types of patterns and interesting stuff! There is too much in it to actually describe it accurately; however, it contains everything from afghans, toys, clothing to baby stuff! My fav is the happy sad face pillow; love it! Worth the $."
1,Disapointed,"I had high hopes for this baking pan, but was met with disappointment. I used it twice, and both times it buckled severely from the heat of the oven. The second time it remained buckled even after it cooled. This pan buckles worse than the cheap pans you can get a discount stores. That hardly makes it worth the inflated price. I'm returning mine!"
3,quality of jelly roll pan,The pan does not lay flat already- Used it in a 375 oven and the bottom distorted. Cookies slid right off without any use of grease.
1,Very disappointed. Are these even real Doughmaker pans or fakes??,"I had two Doughmaker pans for six over years.. I loved them! So when it came time to buy a new one, I was happy to find them here on Amazon. But I'm very unhappy with this one. First of all, it's warped. I never ever had that happen with the ones I bought up in Ft Wayne, IN. Never. It's also turned a very weird ugly gray color. Not metal. You can't even see ANY of the metal after just a few uses. I'm SO disappointed. I want to return it but will they even take it back?! What a joke. Is this what the company has turned into or is Amazon selling fake Doughmaker pans now?"
2,Uneven pan,"I love Doughmakers products and bought this one for my mother who specifically asked for a jelly roll pan. I should have sent this one back. It was a gift, and I didn't notice until later that the pan does not sit even. It's kind of like a table that has a slightly shorter leg; it rocks back and forth and doesn't sit flat and smooth on a countertop. I am disappointed in this purchase."
3,"it didnt work for what i needed, i customized my doors","it feels kinda flimsy, but keep in mind, i live in a very bad neighborhood, so i need super security items, if you need a regular 'lock the door' type thing, this would work. i eventually had to construct my own locking system for my doors, but im always out looking for new stuff. id say this is good if you have little kids, its something they wont figure out fast, but any burglar worth his salt laughs at this.it may work for windows, i didnt try it though. problem with this is if you can fit anything thin ( like a slim jim opens a car lock) between the doors, you can easily pops this.if you do buy this, leave it on the floor, so it cant be picked up.but then again, a stick cut to fit will do you quite nicely."
5,Strong magnets in a cute little package,"These little magnetic clips are the best I've ever seen. They have a really strong magnet (for the size), and the clips are nice for little things (like hanging photos on your fridge) and strong enough for larger things, like holding shut bags of food. These clips are *much* better than Oxo's larger clips, so I would recommend getting only these small ones, not the combo-pack with the larger ones."
3,5 stars for the product - deduction of 2 stars for HORRIBLE pricing,"In 2008 I bought this exact same 8 pack from, ""sold by Amazon LLC"" for only $5.99. Now in 2012 it's $12.54???!!! That's ridiculous.The clips are stellar in performance though. Magnets are super strong and the clips hold extremely tightly, even 4 years later.Buy the white ones instead - you'll still get an 8 pack but they're only $6.99OXO Good Grips Magnetic Mini Clip 8-Pack, White"
4,Exactly as advertised,"I admit to being a bit of a brand loyalist and I do love OXO - and these magnetic clips are great, too. The magnet is strong but not insane, the grip is also strong but not impossible to pry open, and the colors are not too garish. I wanted something that didn't look ugly on my refrigerator but had good grip, and these fit the bill."
4,Strong,"Good strong magnet, and a strong clip. However, I thought they would be bigger. They are only about an inch big."
5,strong little things,"These clips were a little smaller than I was expecting, but the are very useful for a number of tasks around the house and they are super-strong!"
3,Beware: VERY SMALL,"I guess I was expecting something that I could use to seal a bag of Doritos. No way. They're about an inch long, and the jaws open to less than half and inch."
5,Not Just for the Chip Gulch,"Great tool and can be used on hanging goat skins too. I thought this was only for freelance 5 -16 oz chip bags but then realized that the open array diameter can hold up to 10 sq ozs, not bad, considering a crocodile's mouth can only give more psi per sq oz."
3,They are very good only too small,"The product is good, has good grip but you can only use it on very small bags."
5,great fridge magnets,They are small and don't take up a lot of room but they are strong. I really like that they are clips for school papers etc.
5,Smaller then I thought,But they are amazing little suckers! Very strong and good grip. I actually like that they are smaller and don't take over whatever it is I'm hanging on the fridge. I will be ordering more.
5,cant even begin to say how AMAZING....,"okay, all i can say is GET THIS ALBUM! i have had their indie release since august and havent stopped listening to it even though i continue to buy other music, this wont leave my cd player! the vocals are absolutely amazing...a range like jeff buckley... and the arrangements are full and keep you listening over and over and over! the musicians are all so individually talented! i still think how amazing it is that such a talented group of guys have found each other! i was BLOWN AWAY seeing them live. NOT just a studio band! grab this one!! nobody i have played this for has not LOVED it and begged me to get them copies! you will not regret it! PROMISE!"
5,Dancing,"This book opened my eyes to the beginings of the Laubins and their many contributions to the world of the American Indian. The very important contribution of ""The Indian Tipi"" has inspired many to learn how to biuld their own tipi, and to find out more about the Tipi. This thirst for knowledge has given many insperation to Dance and enjoy Tipi camping and living. It is a very good read to find out who these Authors were....Ken"
4,Interesting Noir,"THE CHASE Finally a decent print of this overlooked gem. The picture quality of this restoration is, comparatively, excellent (considering the options we've had in the past!). The sound has a slightly annoying ""hiss"", but this is tolerable and soon goes away because of the crisp clarity of the original soundtrack itself. So--the print is OK on this interesting well-done Cornell Woolrich story...and talk about atmosphere and MOOD!yum yumBURY ME DEAD has a fairly good premise but the film itself very quickly deteriorates untill it becomes annoying and tedious and laughable. Definitely not one of PRC's finest..."
3,Entertaining Noirs; Awful DVD edition,"Of the two films on this DVD, ""The Chase"" is the one really worth watching. It boasts a great cast (boyish Robert Cummings, French star Michele Morgan, and the unique Peter Lorre) and an interesting, dreamlike narrative adapted from a Cornell Woolrich novel.""Bury Me Dead"" starts off well, with a woman attending her own funeral, but, despite cinematography by the great John Alton, the film then becomes a rather conventional whodunit with a surprising amount of wisecracks thrown in and no star appeal.As for the DVD, the sound and image are terrible in both cases. I almost gave up when I first tried to watch them, but ""The Chase"" was interesting enough to make me glad I purchased this, especially since it seems unlikely either film will merit a ""Criterion Collection""-style release. The DVD also includes numerous extras, but be warned that the image and sound are downright awful."
2,Snoozers,"I found both of these to be rather dull & boring, it seems like any Noir outside of the major studies & is a public domain/VCI or Alpha noir are kinda flat..I cant recommend either unless you are a noir completest and must own them. This is the VCI print and its good, but the movies werent"
1,is this old shoe leather?,"I just had to try this product even though it has a negative customer rating. And boy is that rating ever right. This is the nastiest tasting stuff I have ever had, I do think it is a GREEN product though no not just the color but I think they are recycling old shoe leather for the beef taste part of the product. I think I will get rid of it when I have a bunch of the guys over and get em really drunk maybe they will eat this junk then. Do yourself a favor and avoid this stuff like the plague its really NASTY stuff."
1,AGE 3 & UP NOT APPROPRIATE,"I ORDERED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO WILL BE FOUR IN A FEW MONTHS, THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT STATES THIS IS AN ITEM FOR 3 AND UP, WELL WHEN SHE OPENED IT ON CHRISTMAS MORNING THE BOX SAYS AGES 5 AND UP. IT IS NOT FOR A THREE OR FOUR YEAR OLD. I DO NOTT IS TO HARD FOR HER AND SHE IS A VERY BIGHT GIRL. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS ITEM FOR ANY CHILD UNDER 5 OR 6.THANK YOU."
3,Not for 3 year old,This is not for 3 years and older. The box plainly says that it is for ages 5 and up. Waste of money for younger child of 3 years old because it is too difficult.
1,burn your money,"Bought this for my 6-year-old as her ""premier"" Christmas gift. What a disappointment for her and me! Some of the keys stopped working within two weeks. I'd strongly discourage anyone from buying this."
2,compression sock donner,This item was purchased for my husband who has a bad back and cannot bend. Had to return this item as he was not able to use it. He is not able to bend over so he could not put his foot into the sock donner. It is not designed right for people who find it hard to bend over due to back problems. The idea is good but not practical when using. Cannot get socks on from sitting position. Very hard to use. Do not recommend it at all.
5,Love it!,"I was frustrated with the dvd at first(in a good way), because it was challenging... but after doing it for a week or so, I could already see improvements.. and that motivated me to keep doing it. It had really changed my muscles and made my back feel so much better. I really enjoy this dvd and will continue to do it!"
2,Music is distracting,"I borrowed this DVD from a local library since it got wonderful reviews.As most said, it is a stunningly beautiful DVD but I found the music very distracting. There are some tribal music, middle eastern type music which I don't find particularly suitable for Yoga. Also, the music is too loud and I can't hear the instructions very well. If you are very experienced and don't need any instructions you should be able to turn down the music but if you like to hear the instructions, you will find very difficult to listen to.Overall, I would not recommend unless you are a very experienced with Yoga and don't need any instructions (so you can turn down the sound)."
5,A Classic,"This was the first yoga video I every purchased. I have a large collection now and I continue to go back to this one. I love the music, the scenery and the vocals from Erich Shiffmann this dvd provides."
5,most wonderful thing I ever did for myself,"not only does it tone and stretch muscles I didn't even know I had, but it also (more importantly) works on your mind, clears your mind whereby you are able to think more clearly and make better decisions. It also helped me to be slower to anger, more calm. My favorite part is at the end where I feel I am floating in the sky"
3,Somewhat aggressive - visually stunning,The pace is faster than what I am used to in yoga. The sound mix made the background music are distracting and I need to strain to hear the instructor's voice. The camera angles though off my balance. The people and the scenery are gorgeous. Overhyped.
3,nice to look at but could use improvement,"It was a stunning visual image to watch the multi-cultural, inter-generational yoga models perform perfectly synchonized postures in a lovely setting, demonstrating their extreme flexibility. Unfortunately, the video did not offer alternatives for people who lack the flexibility to safely enter the postures; a less visually appealing but more effective video might show some of the presenters using blocks, straps, or other props. Also, the video didn't start with any centering aside from a short breathing exercise. This video would be very well suited for someone who has studied yoga before and is looking for some interesting new routines to add to his or her practice."
2,Very Difficult for those new to yoga with little instruction,"Although the scenery and bodies in this video are lovely and nice to watch,the yoga poses move quickly from one to another with very little instruction on proper form.I am 31 and exercise every day and take a yoga class for 1 1/2 hrs a week. i am in good shape and throughout the video I couldn't help thinking how many people have probably gotten hurt doing it.If you are very experienced in yoga, I would say go for it. If not, pass on this video and consider one that is for beginner to intermediate."
2,You'd better be darn good...,This DVD is visually stunning. It's beautiful. But you'd better be a very advanced student of yoga to even think of being able to keep up.
5,57 YEAR OLD MALE YOGA STUDENT.,I HAD BEEN DOING YOGA FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND HAD NOT FOUND A VIDEO I REALLY LIKED UNTIL MY SON GAVE ME THIS ONE 14 MONTHS AGO. I HAVE DONE IT ALMOST EVERYDAY SINCE AND CREDIT IT WITH MY REALLY GETTING INTO YOGA ... WHICH HAS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL. I GUESS I WOULD SAY THIS VIDEO CHANGED MY LIFE TREMENDOUSLY AND I'M GRATEFUL TO MY SON FOR GIVING IT TO ME AND TO ALI FOR MAKING IT.
5,THE BEST YOGA VIDEO I HAVE FOUND,It was my first video and it was great because it had more detailed in struction while keeping the mode relaxed and enjoyable - complete thumbs up!
3,Absolutely NOT for beginners,I understand this is a great teacher (who works with Ali) and the scenery is beautiful and Ali looks amazing BUT...I found it very painful to try to do many of the exercises and only watched the tape once.
2,too easy,"i suppose it is a good video if you are truly a beginner and are not very flexible, however i am not an expert myself and i wasn't very challenged. believe it or not the meager buns of steel power yoga video is a shorter but much more intense work-out."
1,Sorry but...,this tape was not for me. I found the music distracting. I prefer subtle sounds so that I can just focus on the yoga.Also dissapointed that there were no mention of alignment in the poses nor were any variations given. It is very much 'as is'.p.s. I watched it again to see if I was mistaken but no- I could'nt help thinking there were much better tapes out there. Too bad cos I think Ali looks good in the video.
5,50-years plus reviewer,"I started with Yoga for Dummies. Then progressed to AM/PM Yoga. Both were just what I needed to learn in my own home with no stress. Then I ordered this Ali Macgraw Yoga. I love it. I cannot do everything, so it is challenging. But I can do 70% with some effort. It is longer and more difficult than the other two so makes a perfect step-up. I use it on weekends for a change of pace from PM Yoga."
2,tough for first-timers,"My first yoga experience -- and, although I am young and fit, I injured myself. Be careful if this is your first. Slow movements are not always safe movements."
1,Not at all relaxing,There is no way this video is for beginners. It is extremely difficult and the way the camera zooms around is awful. The whole video moves way too fast.
2,Not as effective as personal instruction!,"After having practised yoga for three years with an instructor, I found Ali McGraw's video both disappointing and ineffective. The poses were not appropriate for yoga beginners and I found McGraw's instruction to be, at times, annoying. The purpose of yoga is to reach personal goals in flexibility and in clarity of mind, not to be rushed into bending and posing without the proper relaxation. I was thoroughly unhappy with the video and do not recommed it to any prospective yoga participants!"
5,Flexibility for the mind and body,"I am a 30 year old woman who has never liked to exercise, but has always been naturally thin (yet flabby). I started yoga not to lose weight or tone up, but rather to reduce stress, and was fortunate enough to pick Yoga Zone's beginner series as my first attempt. After 6 months, I had a calmer mind, and, to my great surprise, a new and improved body. Looking for more challenging videos, I found Ali McGraw's tape two months ago. It's perfect for this stage in my yoga practice. My main goal has shifted to flexibility ---- in both my mind and my body. Daily practice with this video is the best thing I have ever done for myself. If you give it a chance, yoga can ""significantly change your life""."
5,A beautiful experience,This is an excellent dvd. Is not for the beginner unless the beginner is patient!
3,Exhausting! Not for the beginner!,"This is not for the faint of the heart. I run 5km 3-times a week and I do AM-PM yoga. But this video is 60 minutes of sheer hard work. This is not a teaching video. The camera moves too fast to different persons and the camera angle keeps changing. This is more like an aeorobic workout. I suppose when one reaches the flexibiity and strength of the actors in the video, one cold enjoy it."
5,"Beautifully produced, challenging, satisfying workout","This yoga DVD is very well produced. The location, with its blue skies and white sand is beautifully filmed. Erich Schiffmann, the yoga instructor, is an accomplished yogi who works through several poses, one after the other in a flowing manner, paying attention to the breath at all times. His voice is calming and the music is engaging. It will provide a good workout and relieve tension in only 45 minutes! This is an excellent choice for beginners as well as more advanced students."
5,First Yoga Tape! EXCELLENT!!,"I just ordered this tape the other day, and immediately used it the second I received it! WOW - is all I can say! I am a 3d-designer so I work with computers ALL DAY LONG, and get very ancy and anxious while working on projects. On top of that, I wanted to tone my body. Brisk walks and exercising relieves some stress...BUT YOGA WAS MY ANSWER!! The people on the video are so graceful, and the videotography was absolutely breathtaking! I felt like I had better posture and my muscles felt great the first time after doing it! Did I mention this was my first Yoga tape? If you do decide to try it - don't give up! I felt like I was playing TWISTER and was walking on a slippery floor the first time I used it..couldn't help but laugh at myself for being so ""unbalanced."" But slowly, I'm hoping to be as graceful and spiritual as the people on the video. If anyone has found a better tape than this, please let me know, because I think I've found it already!"
2,"Eye Appealing, But Don't Be Deceived","I bought this video for my sibling, and it was soon turned over to me. I was very disappointed with the video. It is visually appealing - white sands, nice video effects, etc. However, very little instruction about the poses was given. Watching the tape several times, you can sort of figure out what to do, but unless you know these poses prior to the tape, it could be dangerous for your body. Precautions on the poses weren't given. Unless you are looking for a video simply to walk you through the yoga you already know, save your money and buy a different video."
4,"Nice, quick yoga workout. Recommened for RUNNERS","I was really looking for a ""Yoga for Runners"" dvd, but can't seem to find one. I'd recommend this for RUNNERS as it has a nice balance of back strength/stretches and good leg stretchs. I like the workout...It's quick, not too intense and is a nice relaxing session. I like that can skip to whichever ""chapter"" you want to start with. Good stretching workout in between long runs or speed workouts."
3,Absolutely NOT for beginners,I understand this is a great teacher (who works with Ali) and the scenery is beautiful and Ali looks amazing BUT...I found it very painful to try to do many of the positions and only watched the tape once.
3,Way too advanced for beginners,"I admire Ms. McGraw & was excited to study yoga, but found myself in no kind of shape to do the excercises on the video. I'm a regular excerciser, so it's not like I'm in no shape at all."
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS!,"This is a beautiful tape. The cinematography is breath taking. For an intermediate tape, perhaps this video may be ideal. However, this video DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH INSTRUCTIONS for a beginner. Erich does not give alternatives for those who are not yet flexible enough for the poses. In addition, the beautiful sand covers the feet of the models, so one is unable to see which way to point the feet during the stretches. The shots of the clouds and the sand (albeit relaxing) detracts from the overall visual instruction of each pose within the video. Definitely not for a beginner."
5,The classic yoga dvd,"I'd heard of this yoga dvd for a couple of years. Finally I rented it from one of the online companies. I was really impressed. Even if you can't get through the entire thing it still will help you. It's difficult and does the Iyengar style of yoga (ie, lots of triangular poses). The triangular poses are great for people with*Hip problems*Hip bursitis*AnyoneI sweated a lot, dripping with sweat and I could only do 1/2 of it. I recommend this as you will feel fantastic after doing it.And as far as Ali McGraw is concerned in this dvd, she's just one of the 3 people doing the poses. She's not teaching it. Erich Schiffman, a reknowned yoga teacher, is the teacher. He has his own dvds so you can get his own dvds as well."
3,Too Difficult for a Beginner,"Although the scenery is beautiful and the actors represent all ages well, I felt the moves were too difficult for a beginner and some of the poses the actors could do were a bit intimidating for a novice.I think I would enjoy the video more after learning the basic moves and increasing my flexibility before attempting the poses in this video."
1,Terrible Workout - OK Poses,"I can't figure out why this video get such good reviews. The poses are OK, but the workout as a whole is terrible. The video is set in a staged desert environment - no mats - so you never know which direction to set your mat at the beginning of the workout. Also, the transitions are terrible - the video stops filming the people and shows the sand and plants - but the descriptions of what is going on is less than useful so by the time they start showing the people again, you are hurrying to get into the position the individuals are in. I much prefer learning the names of poses and then walking through them - with constant video of the individuals so you can see what is going on. This is terrible. My wife agrees."
1,Too Difficult,This video was the most painful yoga workout I have ever done. I wanted something to help me relax and this workout just made me more tense. I had to go to a massage therapist to get out the kinks in my neck and my legs! I wouldn't recommend this tape to anyone.
1,focuses on mental aspects,"I am in Tae Kwon Do, so I bought this video to help with my flexibility, as yoga is the stretching exercise we do in class. My main goal was flexibility, but this video was too slowly paced, and very boring. Even the instructor sounded like he was bored. This video was not challenging enough physically, and mainly concentrated on breathing. In the future, I will rent a video before I buy it."
3,Good with some reservations,"The routine is good, but I found that it seemed somewhat over-produced--too many cuts and sometimes unnecessary choreography. Somewhat hokey clips--rising sun, eagle flying, etc. Once you start to focus on what you're doing this is no longer a problem. But the narration has too much yoga-speak which I found to be off-putting since I watch the tape regularly. ""immerse yourself in the sensation of stretch"". Thanks. I'll do that, right after I immerse myself in the sensation of lowering the volume. But it's a good tape and I do recommend it overall."
3,The Layman's Science Book,"This book is a reflection of the scientific discoveries of the 20th century. Written in layman's terms, this book is fairly easy to read and understand. Not once did I come across a menacing differential equation or proof, so this book is truly for the non-scientific person with a desire to get familiar with at least the accomplishments of the field. I particularly liked the way the author tied everything together and showed how one discovery led to another. The author did this by starting with the premise of mankind's search for the ""theory of everything,"" the holy grail of science. The only thing that I was disappointed with was his brevity on the subject of superstrings, considering their substantial potential. With that said, getting the average reader to the present in light of the past is accomplished well with this text."
2,To Small and not very secure,"Bought this for my grandson of 18 months, he does crawl in, easy to tip over, too small."
3,Still dazing after all these years,"Phyllis Diller cut a distinct niche for herself during the hotly competitive ""golden age of comedy"" years in the 1960's. The routines on this CD demonstrate why. Themes like cosmetic surgery and airline issues are classic and require real insight and creativity to develop. Her unique delivery style adds to the comic impact. I found myself reasonably engaged through most of this listen, though the passing of years and changing of times, along with the short duration of this CD (36 minutes) prevent it from being higher on my list of recommendations."
3,Shallow but worth a read,"Mysterious submarines prowl the coast of Sweden, while a young an ambitious Soviet submarine commander receives new orders. A not so young, but even more ambitious Soviet general plans spy-missions from a secret base made to look like any prosperous town in the western world. Meanwhile, Kathryn Rule, a non-nonsense intelligence analyst, sees growing signs of Russian focus in the Baltic...""Deep Lie"" isn't the deepest of the submarine technothrillers that invaded bookshelves in the late 1980's (whether inspired by ""Red October"" or written earlier but reissued to cash in on the craze), nor is it particularly loaded with the sorts of arcane info that only Clancy was able to divine out of military technology (remember, this was pre-internet.). Yet ""Deep"" is still shallow fun in the way it develops disparate storylines and ties them together. Definitely a fun if forgettable read."
4,Riveting. Gets better the more you read.,"Stuart Woods' earlier books are more detailed and deeper than current books. I think he is just having a lot of fun with Stone Barrington, which I love. But the early Will Lee books are outstanding and I can't put them down. I read a couple of later Will Lee books, but decided I better go back to the beginning, starting with Chiefs, which is one of the best books I've ever read. Stuart Woods never disappoints me."
4,Excellent read,"I enjoyed the book by Stuart Woods as he is one of my favorite authors, this was a very involved story and I had to take my time reading it to be sure I understood just what was going on at all times, but I did like it."
2,Swing and a MISS!,"OK if you must troll the early beginnings of the Will Lee/Rule history, then bemy guest, but don't expect much.This Clancy-esque saga is a little long in the much to uncomfortable world ofinternational intrigue that just does not suit Woods' style. Its painful actuallybut again if you are a fan, or if you have to read literally everything StuartWoods cranks out then have at it. Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,Didn't Like This One!,"I don't care for the espionage/ warfare novels of Stuart Woods as the police detective ones. I feel that if you like these kind of submarine warfare novels then Deep Lie is for you, but if you don't, then don't read this one. Read Santa Fe Rules, that's a winner!"
4,Katherine Rule Rules!,"This is an excellent submarine thriller. It was quite refreshing having a female protaganist in an espionage book. This book is not as formula as Tom Clancy and that's a rather good thing. I love submarine thrillers, and this is certainly one of the better ones."
4,Kept me intrigued throughout the whole book.,I felt this has been one of Mr. Woods best books. The ability to switch characters and storylines without losing the reader was very nice. I will read all of Mr. Woods books.
5,Very enjoyable read.,An early Will Lee/Kate Rule that is very entertaining. Deep Lie is a glimpse into the last days of an ambitious 'Soviet' Russia. I strongly recommend.
4,A good spy novel,This is a great improvement on his last one which was a recital of how rich Stone Barrington has become and his unlikely child who with Dino's son do not seem even vaguely real . He is beginning to tie together the Will Lee series and Stone Barrington and it made me buy the original books that develop Will Lee.
4,Deep Lie,i like the Katherine Rule character. I also like the way Stuart Woods weaves characters into his books between series. It's like they are personal friends.
1,Deep Lie,"I had this removed from my kindle. I didn't get that it was all about submarines. Yuck! I am a huge Woods fan, so I didn't mess with it!"
5,Deep Lie Stuart Woods,"I did not purchase this book, so I have no review.I however have read almost all Stuart Woods books and have yet to be disapointed."
3,This is very small,I bought this for my granddaughter to take her blanket with her to preschool. This bag is VERY small. It is about half the size of a regular bookbag and I actually had to buy her a smaller blanket to fit into it.
4,"cute, small, great for overnight bag","this bag is really adorable, but not too big. We use it for overnight trips, or picnics. the zipper on the front pocket gets stuck frequently, and isnt stitched too well. if you only plan to use this as an occasional bag it would work just fine. if you plan to use it everyday, i believe the zipper would definately break. i do like the features of this bag. you can extend the handle to pull it behind you or wear it as a back pack. perfect for a little girl 3-6 yrs old."
4,Seems like a new book,The book I ordered was a used book however once it arrived it looked brand new to me. I also had the book within 5 days of placing the order. I was impressed with the note the seller included as well. Would order from this seller again.
1,Not my size,"Didn't fit my head. NOT one-size fits all. Had to trash it. Not worth it to return. But if you have a smaller head, then probably a good hat."
2,No consistency,"Ordered several of the same hats over the past several years.There is no consistency with the sizing and style of this particular hat. On this recent order, the crown is even lower and this hat fits more like a baseball hat. The bill is even harder and the material is even different.I ordered two hats, one white and one black and both of them were completely different from each other even though they were completely the same style in their description (foam mesh trucker hat)I now need to find another vendor to try to match the hat I got from these guys a year ago.Can I send you a hat that you sold me a year ago and replicate the exact fit/style/quality? It was perfect before..The hat gets the job done, it is a hat, but it doesn't fit my style. Hope you guys switch back to the same manufacturer as before."
2,Poor...1.5 stars,"This is really a 1.5 stars. Very bad lighting made fight scenes, or any other scene for that matter, unwatchable b/c you couldn't see the people. Fairly bad fight scenes and storyline but some fight scenes are good and some acting is okay. Overall, your life would be the same if you skipped this movie."
3,Almost a 4,"Some good fight choreography, and a pretty good plot make this an entertaining flic. Chen sing play's the role of the villian who uses the tiger fist. The heroes, two lifelong friends showcase the mantis fist (very well displayed), and the other uses his legs (very skilled). the final showdown pits chen sing against the two young fighters. see what happens. another well presented film by tai seng."
3,Too short.,"The poetry and novella here are very enjoyable to read. It is smooth, well-written, melodious poetry, and one realizes why Longfellow was so loved in his own day. Longfellow, with others, such as Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost, is one of the great American poets. Unfortunately, Library of America chose to only publish a selection of his work. As before noted by another reviewer, ""Tales of a Wayside Inn"" is only partial, though the ""Song of Hiawatha"" is here complete (thankfully). This seems inexcusable, since Library of America found time and space for all of Poe, Whitman, Frost, and Stevens, not to mention minor poets like Emerson and Thoreau. Longfellow, as one of the major American poets, deserves better. So 5 stars for his poetry, but 3 stars for this edition of LoA."
1,BIGGEST RIP-OFF IN COOKWARE,"Based on my experience after after six months of use, ScanPan is probably the biggest rip-off in cookware there is. Yes, I was thrilled about the performance the first two months, which fulfilled the claims made by the manufacturer. However, I started to notice the pots' ""nonstick"" properties became useless after cooking in liquid, such as boiling pasta or soups, and was a huge struggle to make macaroni and cheese in. The food would NOT stop sticking! The only somewhat useful pieces were the frying pans,which retained the nonstick properties (because of cooking in oil?) Also, all the pans and pots took too long to heat up compared to other pots and pans. I had to start buying stainless steel pot to boil my eggs in and will eventually have to replace all my pots.For about $500 per set, I expected these to perform much better. Pots not being able to last after five times cooking in liquid is just too big of a flaw. I seriously got burned!"
1,Good for Awhile,"We were excited about this set, but after a year, every piece but the pans started to bubble, and there was black stuff in our food as the bubbles popped. Next, the material in the pans wore off, exposing the metal beneath. The smaller pots not only bubbled, but at the usual ""waterline"" for the soups and sauces, the material simply flaked off. How much of this material have we consumed? I cannot recommend Scanpan. Even if you strictly adhere to each and every caution, the non-stick material eventually deteriorates."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased my Scanpan 2001+ back in 1996 when this was a huge expense for me. The first six months were perfect - the best cookware ever. But then the non-stick surfaces began to slowly deteriorate. The smallest saucepan was so bad I threw it out. Now everything sticks.The two large casseroles are the only items that remained perfect, although one did warp in the oven so the glass cover no longer fits well. I now use those two the most, even for frying.I followed the cleaning directions to the letter, did not put them in the dishwasher and I was the only person using the Scanpan.I just got my things out of five-years of storage which is what brought the defects to my attention again. Maybe I'll try returning the damaged items as some of the other reviewers have mentioned."
1,Great in the beginning...wait a few years,"I bought my Scanpan set 10 years ago. I love it when it's new. It cooks evenly and it's truly non-stick. My issue is that after about three years of normal cooking, the ceramic coating starts to bubble and flake off. I now have to send this back to them on my dime for replacement. To me, a lifetime guarantee means I shouldn't have to keep doing this.I have recently replaced my entire set of cookware with another non-stick set. (Pampered Chef Executive Cookware) I bought a few pieces of the other non-stick three years ago at the same time I sent several Scanpan pieces in for warranty replacement (again). The other/new set of cookware is going strong and is not in need of replacement. My scanpan is now a very expensive, though nice, set of camping cookware.For the record, I hand wash my cookware, I don't use non-stick sprays, I only use nylon/plastic or bamboo utensils, and I never use high heat. The long-term performance of this cookware is unacceptable."
1,Scanpan Classic Ceramic Titanium 11-Piece Chef's Cookware Set (Kitchen),"ScanPan Classic 11 Piece Set (20410) SPN20410 The cookware worked well for awhile,but after a time it started flaking parts of the interior off.Sent the dutch oven back for a replacement and received a new one, The second one alsostarted to flake off. I also noticed that the sauce pans also has this defect. Stay away fromthis cookware."
1,"WON'T TAKE A LICKING, AND SOON STARTS STICKING ! ! !","Like many other reviewers for Scanpan pieces/sets, my experience with this cookware has been awful. I've tossed a complete set out after just four years of use. I'm aware there is a warranty, but why replace bad with bad? Besides, the process for warranty replacement has less appeal than a root canal. It's a joke.YOU REALLY OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check around on the Internet for consumer feedback/reviews on this overpriced and overrated cookware. Again and again you'll read about how the nonstick surface eventually discolors, then forms little bubbles, the surface degrades, then finally loses all its nonstick qualities. Take the time to read customers' 1-star ratings here on Amazon for both sets and single pieces, and you'll read the same thing over and over again. SERIOUSLY, FOLKS, THINK TWICE."
1,Scam pans,"My husband and I spent several hundred dollars getting many of these pans. We followed the cooking instructions while using them and within a year the coating started bubbling and then peeled. With the lifetime warranty we wrote to the company and asked what we could to do to get our pans replaced. To our amazement we were told they would help us only if we had our receipt... So, now we are left with very expensive pans we can't use.. If I were any of you, I would really look at other options... We are very disappointed in the way we were treated and the quality of the pans."
1,ghastly,"Who said Angeles Mastretta was a good storyteller? this book is so cliched, it makes me cringe!"
4,Hey Digimon!Hey Digimon!,"It was a pretty cool book, but I warn you-there are bloopers!Especially if you watch the show, you'll notice everything wrong in this book.There is A-LOT of things they messed up on.Well any how, this book gives info on Digimon you never knew. A great book for the Digimon fans."
3,"Good info, save the descriptions","A. Ryan Nerz does a good job when it comes to the stats, but it's lacking something when it comes to descriptions. Most of them simply say what the Digimon looks like (as if the pictures didn't show us)and their attacks. That's usually about it, unless they add how scary or strong the Digimon is and that we should watch out for them. Sometimes they throw in an extra bit, like what part they played in the show, which is a plus. All in all, it's a nice book despite the not up to par descriptions. Extras include and FAQ, show information, and Digidestined information."
2,other than the mistakes it was fine,"I got this book at a boookstore in Niagara Falls,NY and when I first read it I noticed all the mistakes and my copy has pencil-mark corections all over it because I can't stand things like that."
2,Review of Digimon Digital Monsters: The Official Character G,"The official review of this book was misleading. As a result of the review, I expected to find each name written in both English and Japanese."
5,a great success,This was given to my four year old grandson mainly for the binos which he loves to wear and use. They are a good size for him and good quality as well.
2,marginal magnification,"The magnification these provide is pretty weak. But, my small kids still like them."
3,Not up to the Other British Mystery Series,"We love the different British mystery series such as Miss Marple, Inspector Morse, Poirot, & Midsomer Murders, but Tommy and Tuppence just aren't as good. Entertaining? Yes, but not worth owning. We recorded them off British TV, and after watching the series, recycled the tapes."
4,"Great Content, Awful Presentation","The stories are wonderful. The acting is cute and campy in a very good sense. Unfortunately, the DVD encoding leaves a lot to be desired. The main problem is that the 2 channel surround shunts all sound to the rear speakers (except for the first episode which is encoded properly). If you cannot turn off the surround sound on your system, this will become annoying quickly! It is very much worth purchasing, but be aware of the sound problems."
4,Amatuer to Professional,I watched this series on PBS originally and had fun watching in again. This set includes the pilot for the series and I had not seen it before. It gave a nice introduction to the two title charactors. The series starts out with the two taking over a defunct detective agency to help the British government catch a war criminal. They find after this case is cleared up that they enjoy the detecting business and the series goes on from there. Tommy and Tuppence handle each new challenge with verve and penache.
3,bottom end of the Christie quality scale,"The married detectives solve crimes by blundering onto the solution. You should be able to solve several of these episodes within one minute of having the general situation revealed.Once that is understood, the acting and sets are first rate. If you are into cultural anthropology, you will like the series. If you are into crime detection, you will be disappointed."
3,partners in crime-tommy&tuppence set 1,each disc has one episode that has no sound. thoroughly enjoyed the episodes that have sound.
2,great fun but poor sound quality,Tommy and Tuppence are Agatha Christie light. Good fun and not heavy handed. But the dvd sound quality on two of the episodes is dreadful. To hear the actors the volumn must be turned very high and then there is background static. What a shame to ruin this as the picture quality is better than some Acorn productions.
3,18 years and counting since . . .,". . . ""A Music Fan"" has pulled his head out. If you didn't like at least some of Sugar's Copper Blue, you gotta be braindead. yeah, yeah, husker du, the golden years, blah blah blah. get over it, move on, develop some new musical interests. i'm gonna see bob live in february and i'm sure i'll 'like it' just fine!"
1,18 years and counting...,"that's how long it's been since i saw Husker Du bring down the house in New York in 1987 during their farewell tour. unfortunately, Bob hasn't come up with anything i liked since then and this is no different. This is just WAY too commercial for my taste. I can't believe he used that stupid played out voice effect on one song like Cher. Any Husker Du song from any of their albums far exceeds any song on this album. Grant Hart's post Husker Du material is far superior. please don't buy this album. i would give it zero stars."
5,MOULD IS MAGIC!!,"Bob Mould is one of the most talented singer songwriter/Guitarists EVER! He really pours out his every essence of his soul. You can hear his heart in every song!'Body Of Song' is a mind blowing album. The production makes me sweat! It is so clear and pristine, yet there is so much going on underneath...swirling, moving about. This album has him cranking up his GUITARS nice and loud. To me there is nothing better than Bob cranking up his Stratocaster or Flying V! His adulation with electronica accents this album instead of over saturating it!Good Job Mr. MouldLove ya man!Bill Tolles"
5,NCIS - Best show on TV,"No show has ever quite affected me the way NCIS does, and it's because of the camaraderie of the cast and the guest roles."
5,Good Product,As advertised the movie's are great to have as a historical keepsake of the show. My daughter loves the series
5,Awesom,"I love NCIS, and to watch all the episodes without stopping is just great. I love friday night marathon of NCIS."
4,"Menu changed for the worse: no subtitles and no ""Play All"" function",The first two episodes' guest stars are Eyal Podell and Brandon Barash - both sleeper stars biding their time in the land of Daytime Television aka soap operas.
5,NCIS at a cost.........................,The ncis 4th Series was eagerly awaited and the programmes never fail . The scriptwriters must have excellent senses of humour but the thrills and sppills of intell. work are still there . No problems with the DVD's . However if you are buying from the UK like me you might want to wait for UK release as I was charged 11.99 tax - thats $24 so made this set rather expensive .GRRR.
1,Perhaps this would help,"I have yet to recieve my purchase, so i wouldnt be able to tell you about the product but i can honestly say that Amazons service is shocking!!! This was due to come in on the 20th Dec and it was a Christmas Present!!!! it has yet to arrive"
4,NCIS fourth season,I have not had a chance to view this DVD yet but it appears to be in good condition. Thank You
4,awesome show,"i've watched every episode of this show and it's effing awesome; i'm amazed it's not more popular. each season comes in a cardboard case with three plastic disk cases in it which is a piece of crap, they always break but totally worth it."
5,NCIS 4th season,We are collecting each season and re-watching the episodes as a family; it's a fun series to own.
5,Don Bellisarius does it again.,"What can be said? Another great show from the creator of Magnum P.I. I regret that I didn't start watching this show until midway through the third season.ell, I now own the first three seasons on DVD, and I'm chomping at the bit waiting for season 4 to come out. Great writing, wonderful characters, incredible directing. As a general rule, I despise most TV, but I cannot say enough good things about NCIS. It's a real standout."
5,NCIS is as good as ever!,"The fourth season of NCIS is great entertainment, just like the three before it! NCIS has some of the best characters on TV: Gibbs (intense), Tony (playboy), Ducky (quirky), Abby (funny) and all the rest of the cast. I have to admit, I miss Kate's character, but I've warmed up to Ziva. And she is the reason Gibbs returns to NCIS at the start of this season after he had retired to Mexico.One thing that makes the show great is there is so much camaraderie among the cast. Whether they're solving a crime or just giving each other grief, there is great chemistry there.My husband and I love the show, and will continue to watch NCIS for as long as it runs!"
3,Upsetting,Bit annoying when you buy an item and then cant download shows or movies because you live outside of the country. You are not told when you purchase the item that this is the case. Other than that the item is Kindle Fire is good.
5,More good stuff from Donald P. Bellisarius,"I was a long time fan of JAG and very disappointed when it ended. I finally started watching NCIS and find the same great writing and engaging characters.With so much junk on TV, I can say, these guys get it right."
2,Disappointed,"I was quite upset with the purchase of season 4, as I am an avid fan of NCIS, it was maddening to find that one of the DVD's was so scratched that I couldn't watch it, not to mention you can't return it, so be careful when buying movies and make sure that they can be returned. It is an excellent show but gets on my nerves with all the bashing that Tony and Ziva do to McGee. Im hoping that those two will be eliminated sometime in the near future."
3,No Subtitles!?,"Not sure why, but there were subtitles for Season 3; but they decided not to do them for Season 4? They did not do them for Seasons 1 or 2 other but it seems random to have Season 3 with them and then 4 not. Does anybody know if Seasons 5-7 do or not? I am deaf and hard of hearing so its hard to watch without subtitles. I can not get closed captioning due to the new LCD tvs and digital connections. It is really difficult to watch. But I love the series, since Season 7 when my husband got me into it.Just watching from the beginning now so I hope they can update all new dvds to include the subtitles."
3,"Well, not sure if I like it as much as the other seasons","as said above, I'm not sure wether I like this season as much as the other three seasons. It starts quite slow and it took me a while to get reacquainted with the characters. There are some really good humorous moments during the whole season but some of the plots have become foreseeable. There are also at least two episodes where the plot very strongly resembles episodes of other forensic series. Who covered from whom is not for me to say."
1,AMAZON SUCKS,I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!!
2,Por que no eta subtitulada o doblada al español??,"Esta serie me encanta, pero en esta ultima temporada no vino ni subtitulada ni doblada al español y deseo saber porque y si en algun momento tienen pensado ponerla en venta con esta sugerencia. creo que al igual que yo, hay muchas personas a la espera de esto para conseguirla y tenerla dentro de su colección.En ese mismo plan estan otras series que he estado coleccionando pero desde hace un tiempo solo aparecen en inglés. Quisiera que fuera como antes cuando uno podía conseguir estas series en el idioma deseado."
1,I Tried to put 0 stars but it wouldn't let me.,I was very excited to view this film but found myself incredibly disappointed. This movie was NOT in anyway about an adventurer or journalist discovering tribes or cannibals which happen to practice homosexuality but rather just a dull putz from New York who branched out to find different sexual partners.Tobias was in no way an entertaining man nor were the film producers very wise for creating this documentary which showed more about his homosexuality than it does entertaining footage of meeting with his reunited cannibal tribes or scenery.Taking a look at the cover and summary was far more incredible than the actual movie. I give the cover of the film an 8. Movie 0.
1,GREAT film HORRIBLE transfer,"One of W & W's best films, but the transfer is horrible. The print pulls out of focus at several points, and is so dark you can't make out the action. Some reels are better than others, the worst being reels 1,4 & 5. It's a shame that Warners put so little effort into this title as it's a great film, and than charge us collectors top dollar. Stick to the VHS and Laser Disc versions which are much better."
5,A terrific book,"This book is about making the best of your abilities, whether you're a graduate of an Ivy League school or Podunk State University. I wish I'd read this book when I was in my teens.I'll be buying copies for young people that can use this to develop ""real talent."" I consider it a near-perfect graduation present.As an aside, I could not disagree more with the earlier review that complained about overachieving and getting burned out. I didn't consider Rotella's approach to be a burnout one at all. If you've found what you love to do, then becoming really good at it is not a recipe for burnout, but rather satisfaction. It sounds like the sour reviewer burned himself oout at something he didn't really love, or couldn't learn to love."
2,Not much here,"This book lacks depth. It is like reading ""The Catechism for Dummies."" Read Richard Gula (Reason Informed by Faith) instead."
3,A lot of $$ for a mismatch set.,"I had high hopes for these glasses. The design is very elegant and the etching is all intact and in a beautiful script. However, the glasses are vastly different sizes. The ""Groom"" glass is much skinnier, and the edge of the glass at the top is about 1/8"" thick. Compared to the ""Bride"" glass, they look like completely different sizes of glasses. For $20 I was hoping for a little better quality. I'll keep them because my wedding is coming up fast and money is tight.Bottom line: If both glasses matched in size, it'd be worth $20. Sadly, I either received a fluke or the quality in general just isn't up to par."
3,Fun and Foolishness,"I'm not really big on musicals, but I am a big Jimmy Stewart buff. This is typical Stewart, high on fun and frolic, low on isues of substance. Music good .... greed bad. Okay by me.Reviewed by Kathie Freeman."
2,Not up to spec,"I'm sorry, I found this a step down from the Glasswright's Apprentice. That was a reasonably good book, but didn't really warrant a continuation of the story. The characterization is lame and Lasky does nothing to make you like these people, or care what really happens to them."
2,A dime a dozen.,"The prospective reader should keep in mind that this is very much a fantasy novel by a female author. It begins badly and ends well, but it is unclear how or why this comes about (magic!)."
3,Useful but not well built.,"If you need a reader that works in nearly anything (as long as it has a usb port), then this is a great deal. However, don't let it get banged around because it will break."
4,"Handy, portable, works well, but not ideal for the pocket.","I bought this adapter to put a spare MicroSD card to use. Transfer speeds are perfectly acceptable, it's held up well bouncing around in my bag, etc.However, it doesn't make the best pocket USB thumb drive, for two reasons. First is the fact that the cap that protects the USB end isn't attached (and therefore easy to lose). The second is that there's no place to thread it through a keychain or zipper or whatever. (The fact that the MicroSD card protrudes a little out the other end hasn't been a problem for me, though. It stays snugly in place).I only subtracted one star for this 'cause I'm not sure it was really intended to be used as a thumb drive; I was just hoping it would work out as one."
1,This doesn't work,"I tried to use the Kinamax MicroSD card reader with two computers using different Microsoft operating systems (XP and Vista). In fact, the card reader caused my Vista OS computer to crash. A complete waste of money."
2,"good music, bad recording","The Scottish Dances are some of my favorite pieces of music, and they are played well, but the poor recording job detracts severely from the music. Granted, it's not awful, but I tend to notice little things when listening to music. If you are thinking about buying this CD, I recommend you get a different recording of these songs."
3,It's ok,"Name on first page, I was not told about.I will consider using them but this left a bad taste."
1,Edwards gives no evidence.,"When I purchased this book I expected the content to be of much greater quality. Instead, I found unsubstantiated statements sprinkled with sarcasm.Throughout this book Edwards makes many claims of the historical, but not once does he say where he gets his information. A man with his level of education surely knows how to footnote and endnote. Maybe what he says is true, but how are his readers to know?For those who want to understand the early church I suggest readingWill the Real Heretics Please Stand Up: A New Look at Today's Evangelical Church in the Light of Early Christianityby David Bercot."
2,"Same thesis, better alternative available","While Edwards' premises are factual, he does not document them, thus the analysis underlying his positions comes across as 'prideful' (as one reviewer put it). The same thesis is presented with considerably better documentation in Frank Viola's ""Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices"". I understand that Viola is a friend and compatriot of Gene Edwards; he has done a far better job of making the case, in my view."
4,Startlingly original dissection of first-date discomfort.,"It may not seem that the awkwardness of a first date between typically lonely New York City coworkers would hold much interest, but Tom Noonan's film has enough twists and turns to make it memorable. His writing and directing are incisive and original, but his greatest coup was the casting of Karen Sillas as the offbeat law office secretary whose seemingly mundane life masks some uncomfortable secrets. Sillas, an indie film favorite, is one of the best actresses in films today; the power of her performance as it builds in nuance and intensity must be seen to be believed. The movie will definitely make you think twice about having a first date in a 'neutral' (and public) location. Highly recommended. END"
1,Big disappointment !!!,"Very! Very! Good movie, but...?It's only poor quality transfer from VHS to DVD."
3,Familiar songs/familiar stars sing for the tots,"Although there's no indication on the CD, TOYS FOR TOTS CHRISTMAS STARS sounds very much like a DELTA/LASERLIGHT product. Most of these tracks appear here or there on that budget label's holiday CDs.The song mix on ""Christmas Stars"" includes several medium-fidelity radio transcriptions from Crosby, Sinatra and Cole, as well as some modern-day recordings by reconstituted ""groups"" like the Platters and Drifters. These latter cuts feature a single member of the original lineups. The ""Drifters"" sides are the weakest of the 17 presented on this album because of a mediocre electronic orchestration.There are still enough fine performances here to make the disc worth playing-- in particular the Ella/Bing version of ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"" and Sinatra's single offering, ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."" Mahalia Jackson's two solos with organ are also both very nice."
1,literally the pits!,"I've had this set plus some open stock for four or five years. Just like others who rave about their NEW pans, I liked it at first but even tho I have not mistreated the pieces, they all stick, and worse than any other surface I have ever owned. The fry pans in particular must be scoured regularly and then seasoned as suggested but it doesn't help much. Saucepans stick as well and even pasta cannot be boiled without sticking and having to be scraped and scoured off. Two of the saucepans have also developed a couple of deep pits. I'm ready to go back to stainless steel, which is really easy to clean."
5,Superb accompaniement to visiting sites of Ancient Egypt,"Used this book during a visit to the ancient sites of Egypt and found it superb as an extension of the information provided by local guides. Really helped to bring ancient Egypt alive, even returned with a replica of the blue hippopotamus shown on page 219. Occasional cross reference errors such as Page 115 ref to 'illustration, p126' is actually on p122, and (I think) ref to tomb of Ramesses IV on p114 should read Ramesses VI, having visited the actual tomb in The Valley of the Kings. This however did not detract from the overall superb value including first class details of Egypts real treasures,'The Temple of Karnak' p208-208 and 'Inside the Great Pyramid' p182-183. These diagrams alone make the book worth taking on a visit."
3,It's OK but...,This book is OK but it says it all in the title: Ancient Egypt. By trying to cover all of ancient Egypt in a single volume it is short on detail. It is OK if you just want a quick overview of all the different aspects of all phases of ancient Egyptian life & work.
5,Ancient Egypt,This book covers every aspect of life and thinking in ancient Egypt. It contains a good amount of facts laid out in an easy to find manner. Most subjects are covered in two pages making it quite readable. There are numerous colorful illustrations that enhance and clarify the subject matter. The quality of the paper it is printed on is very nice addition.
4,Really liked this one!!,Although I 'do' have a bias when it comes to Andy Lau... I just love this actor... have seen quite a few of his movies.....
1,Shockingly bad,A big fan of Shu Qi which drew me to this movie. It was a big disappointment. Highschool plays could delivery better performance in term of acting. Story line is stupid with really cheap special effects. Please save your money. I rented this movie for $1.99 and still regret the money that I spent.
2,WHAT was THAT?!?!?,"Mix ""Men in Black"" with ""The X Files"" and ""Terminator"", add some really badly-translated subtitles and dubbed English dialogue, and you have a flick that doesn't even need the 'bots of Mystery Science Theater 3000 to make it funny. Although the date given for this film is 1993, [one website] tags it as a 2002 film. And, as the reviewer there notes, this film is ""deep hurting."" This one is strictly for (unintentional) laughs."
4,good interactive book,This book is good for focusing on the big-brother-or-sister to be. You include pictrures and go over the basic things of what will happen before the baby comes. My daughter still likes to read this occasionally and her brother is 2. She really liked that there was a picture of her for me to take to the hospital.
4,not a bad book,"I purchaced this book with the power tools for reason, and the producing music with reason. It has alot of usefull information and some interesting tips. The reason manual is good but lacks explination in some areas. It not a rewording of the manual by any means and it would be a good starting point for lerning more beyond the wuick start books."
4,Another solid Poirot adventure,"A young woman is murdered during a party where a fireworks display is featured. Just moments before, she borrowed a distinctive jacket from her cousin, who was wearing it. It seems clear that the cousin was the intended target. Once again, it is up to Hercule Poirot to ferret out the culprit. This is yet another solid entry in the POIROT series, with David Suchet providing the definitive portrayal of the Belgian sleuth. Hugh Fraser, Pauline Moran and Philip Jackson all provide solid support as usual. Another must-see for Agatha Christie fans. Highly recommended."
4,Crochet Today = Good magazine,"I subscribed this magazine b/c my daughter starts interested in crochet. My first issue we received arrived on time and had several good patterns. However, my daughter will need to learn all of the abbreviations before she can start follow.Overall, good magazine for beginner/intermediate level."
2,always charges account-- RARELY--DELIVERS PRODUCT!!!!!,i have renewed magazines 3 times now My account gets charged for a year subscription then in 3-5 months i get a renewal notice!!! delivery of magazines however is always interupted!!!it has been 4 months now with no magazines( the bad part is they are GIFTs)I get no where with the staff when i call. It is unfortunate that all mag scipts HAVE TO come thru amazon---going to a prison.Inmate sees one copy then not again for months!!!!!yet i pay to continue renewal so that there is NO disruption!!!!!!!
3,Crochet Today Magazine purchased from Amazon,I was not very impressed with the magazineThe best part about it was that I could purchase it online from Amazon
5,Worth it!,"I got a subscription to this magazine as a gift. I have already received 6 issues and I have not been disappointed with any. Every issue has helpful tips, and a wonderful variety of projects that are well written, and illustrated. The yarn choices used for the projects are very easy to find, and are usually quite economical. One of my favorite features of this magazine is a quick reference in the back of every issue that covers basic stitches, and yarn substitutions (by both type of yarn, and brand). I have purchased several other crochet magazines, and this one is by far the best."
2,nothing modern,Just more of the same patterns available everywhere. I didn't find anything new or exciting. I also dislike when you order a magazine and they send out the past 2 issues at the same time as the current one. I got three of my years subscription within a week.
5,Love it,So thankful to finally have my own copy! I now have a lot more ideas and how tos. Can't wait for the next issue.
1,Not happy with magazine,"When my subscription started, I was sent two issues at once, one already old. I contacted the magazine right away and a month later still have not gottena response."
