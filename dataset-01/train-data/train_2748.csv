3,Wartime Richmond Dectective Novel,"In this novel, all the parts are in place and the machine works pretty well. Wartime Richmond is captured in period detail: streets and building locations, interiors of hotels, prisons, and government offices, meals, clothes, smells, animals, etc. Characters are distinctive and memorable; the appearance of Lee and Stuart are a little distracting but they stay within character. The motives for crimes in question are well hidden but a bit outlandish; yet 'suspension of disbelief' is accepted because the background stories and the period detail works so well in the hands of a good writer. I bought this book for the historic location and was not disappointed. Also, as a mystery reader, I finished the last page thinking that I wouldn't mind seeing another with the same main character."
4,'Scared the [stuff] out of a then ten-year-old!,"When I saw the pilot episode of the classic sci-fi anthology, I was frightened beyond belief. The mouthless, glowing alien that the unwitting radio announcer ""yanks"" from outer space was enough to make a kid sleep with a nightlight on.As an adult, I can now better appreciate the social commentary built into this particular installment. Also, the acting of a young Cliff Robertson, fresh from his popular role in ""PT-109"" can be also be credited for the success of this entry.While the later ""The Bellero Shield"" explored a similar theme of reversed ""alien abduction"" with better results, ""The Galaxy Being"" was a great start to a show that should've lasted beyond its two years."
3,"Long and interesting, but I lost track of alot of things.","This book is obviously not meant for someone my age (14) or at least it seems, I lost track of characters throughout the story and often was confused, and i'm a pretty smart guy (3.7 GPA). This book was interesting and it showed me how people can corrupt all sorts of things including space. It has decent characters but alot of them are similar and hard to remember sometimes. I gave this book a three because i had troubles with it. You may not and thats okay, i was just in a rush to finish this book so i could start on a new one. All in all its a good read if you feel like exploring our galaxy. Or at least Jupiter."
3,"""King James"" style English sometimes hard to follow","I have this translation, the Yusuf Ali translation, and the ""Translation Committee"" in Istanbul (Ozek, et al) versions.Pickthall and Ali have some obsolete style English in them that can get in the way of understanding them; but combined with the Istanbul version it adds understanding. In many ways Pickthall's translation maintains more ""depth"" and some of the fluidity of the Arabic - at least according to some of the folks I know who read Arabic. Ali has some odd explanations from places like Shakespeare that seem out of place.So, I consider this one well worth purchasing - especially if you find the version that also includes the transliteration so you can learn to recite from it."
3,An Unpredictable Murder,"I think the book was quite good but I was told it was one of the best books I'd ever read but I didn't think it was that good. The book ""Making Up Magaboy"" is about a 13 year old boy who takes his fathers gun and goes to the local liquor store. He opens fire on a Korean man and kills him. He was a very good student and he is also a good kid. He doesn't have many friends, though. Since events like Columbine, books like this are much more realistic and believable. I would recommend this book to people who like books that are for the mind not the heart."
5,This is a real stunner.,"Virginia Walter and Katrina Roekelein have put a lot of thought into this small, tragic tale. It doesn't answer the question we all have --Why?-- but it's got more depth and more breadth than all the news stories put together. I had a couple of small disagreements with the graphics, where I thought the designer sacrificed reality and readability for design. But the people are marvelous: the pricipal with the one-track mind, the shallow material girl, and the good friend of whom Robbie's parents didn't approve. And Robbie, who probably has no more idea than anyone else why he destroyed all those lives."
1,trash,"This book was trash. It had no purpose, plot, or ending. It was just a way for 2 crazy poeple to get their bizarre doodles onto paper. Enough said, words shouldn't be wasted on this book."
4,almost anyone could find this book fascinating!,"This author has a fabulous way of blending ""self-help"" ideas in with valuable cultural anthropology. She does a great job of avoiding useless generalizations, yet points out real cultural patterns in women (and men) in regard to relationships. Her use of several myths and fairytales, plus real-life examples, grab your attention and keep the book juicy (not dry) reading! I have recommended this book to all my women friends and relatives, no matter what their personal experience might be. I found that the book was quite relevant to many women my age (mid-20s), but heartbreakingly even more so for women of my mother's generation. But I would also recommend it to any smart man for gaining some sharp new perspectives on women's psyches (and theirs, by comparison)."
5,Backroads of Washington,"This is one beautiful book. The pictures are superb and the writing is outstanding. A treasure to leave out on the coffee table to be perused at leisure and with the enjoyment of learning about Washington's unique beauty. A great joy, well done."
3,O.K.,Not a bad watch. The band could be a bit longer. The buttons are a bit stiff to push. If you want accurate ambient temperature of course you have to take it off of your wrist (duh!). Kind of fun for the price.
2,Not very good,This was not too good of a book . I thought it was very very boring . And the ending is terrible . But if really want to buy it I think the age range should be 8-11 . If you do buy this book I hope you have more fun reading it then I did .P.S You might want to try the book ''lindsy'' by the brand name americangirl instead .
2,Not what I expected,"Although the projects are interesting, it is a very old edition, so it seems very retro. I didn't like it that much."
3,Difficulties in Chinese knotting,"Unfortunately the book Chinese Knotting does not deliver ""creative designs that are easy and fun."" The directions are hard to follow, and although accompanied by pictures, there are not enough step by step detail in the pictures for them to be particularly helpful."
3,Poorly explained,"If you are already an experienced ""knotter"" you may appreciate the more intricate knots presented in this book. I, on the other hand, am a novice and found Ms. Chen's diagrams and instructions hard to follow.Also, the majority of projects shown put the finished knots in a more traditional usage than what I am interested in. Although an experienced practioner will no doubt find creative ways to showcase the knots, I found very, very few that inspired me to begin a project.I much prefer Suzen Millodot's Chinese Knots for Beaded Jewellery."
4,"A little experience, but not much knowledge",An excellent primer on the Eight Basic knots. Wonderful pictures and how the knots are used in projects.
3,book review,this book looks very interesting. I only tried one knot so far and it wasn't too hars to follow.the pictures of the finished products are not up to date showing chinese women posing the knotsin general- i think this book is a great inspiration for beaders to use in their beading projects[...]
4,loved it,"You don't even have to be a fan of instant star to love this cd. I personally am more into r&b and hip hop and yet I know every word to almost all of her songs.Alexz Johnson is talented and although I don't like the fact that Jude Harrison(the character she plays on the show) is always in a new relationship,that show is great and the soundtrack is better. I love Who am I fooling and natural disaster"
5,Absolutely Brilliant,Top Class item. Absolutely brilliant a really nice piece and good value for money.*****
1,No quantity. No sales!,I have not bought this item and would not consider it since there is no mention of the quantity you are buying. Why is that?
4,good cd!,"this is a pretty good collection of Ringo's finest stuff. the only song I wished had been included was a duet he did with Willie Nelson, titled, ""Write One for Me."" it was a great song from about 2003. that would have made this album perfect (for me)!"
3,The Starr!,"Good sounding collection. I would've put together a different type of collection of tracks spanning through his entire career which would've also made for more treasures on the video disc.This collection is pretty much the ""Blasts From Your Past"" compilation, along with a bigger handful of lesser known tracks. Ringo has much more to offer than what was put on this collection."
4,Could have been better,"I love Ringo's post-Beatles stuff, but I think the song selection could have been a little better. We could have did without the Atlantic stuff and I would like to have seen a couple more cuts from the ""Ringo"" CD. I thought the footage on the bonus dvd could have been remastered before it's release... Apple, Please wake-up!!!!"
2,Big Disappointment,"Its nothing that we dont already know. I taught it would talk more about the rumors that surrounded these celebrities deaths, instead it spent less than 10 minutes on each person just telling how they died. We already know James Dean died in a car crash, Sal Mineo was murdered, and Natalie Wood drown. It was a huge disappointment and definetly a waste of money."
3,beautiful,I like these but the stones are a little larger than i had thought . I have been wearing them and the are comfortable. I will buy from that department again
3,"Maybe, Maybe Not","This book is a small selction of lead generation methods. Whether or not they work for you probably depends on your product-market. Most of the methods that were emphasized seemed to discount the prospect's intelligence: classified ads and direct offers with copy reminscent of a carnival hawker. The chapter about strategic partnerships had the most valuable content.Overall, this book is a little light on lead generation methods - especially how to qualify them for your business. It also has a lot of fluff: a storyline, pages of questions with lots of blank space, and a long pitch for business coaching. I got more out of the author's cash flow book."
3,10 x 10 blue tarp cover,"This is a very nice tarp cover and for most circumstances would probably work for anyone. However, in really windy conditions it doesn't hold up so well. It was too thin, it's only 5mm thick. It also doesn't have enough grommets, only three per side. If you live in a place that gets windy, buy the thicker 10mm tarp. With more grommets."
4,Great for someone who loves Medical Mystery's!,"If I could give half stars, this one would be a 3.5. I'm rating up because I did enjoy the plot line.Mr. Nayes did a great job with his writing style on this book. The knowledge that he showed in his writing was excellent, but for me it was personally over my head. I found myself skipping through a lot of the technical and medical references.I did enjoy the storyline - and thought it was very creative. The characters were good - and there was enough depth to give some good insight on them and make them appealing.Someone who is very much into medical mystery's, enjoys and understands the medical references made in this book would probably find this a 5 star book.I do enjoy Mr. Nayes stories and will continue to read them as they are released."
1,Earlier version much better!!!!,Does not run well in Windows 7 - requires the program disc must be mounted while playing the game. Very poor design!!! Would not recommend purchasing!! Earlier version mmuch better!!!!!!!
3,OK... Reveiw,"I would consider this game OK. The graphics are OK the sound,all of that stuff is OK.But I still could see a better Battleship Game."
5,"A Very Fine, Honest Effort","Though not covering as much, and in a more objective tone, I found this book to be superior to Douglas Horne's book.ERG"
5,"Decent quality belt, good price","This seems like a good serpentine drive belt. Just installed it.The price, on sale, here on amazon was quite a bit less than at the local auto parts store."
2,Don't Buy this product!,"You guys better listen, if you buy this item, you will be very sorry. I've had this thing returned, and so called repaired, and it still only DVDs 50% successfully. Try to get help from those useless fools at Zenith is a total waste of time. This, with out a doubt, will be my last item I'll buy from them. They moved to Mexico and have become one of the worst names out there. Their TVs now are made badly.This unit is so bad, I can't say enough bad things for it. If you need to have a machine that make coasters for you, this is it, because you never know if it will ever work. Some days you maybe lucky and get it to work and somedays you are better off just turning the thing off."
2,Not for the well informed,"As mentioned in another review the first edition read like a childrens book. Even more insulting was the cartoonish scribbles used as illustrations. It is honestly not appropriate for anything more than an introduction to the subject for teenagers. In that role it would suit its purpose fairly well, unfortunately that is not the type of book the cover and title suggest."
5,Box of Bride and Groom Die Cut Invitations,The cards came in a timely manner and in great condition. Thanks so much. Virginia
5,Finally a normal looking cookie!,"I live in the S.CA mountains at 6000 ft, and since moving here I have been at a loss in terms of turning out a decent oatmeal cookie. I have made several attempts, with different recipes, but to no avail. The end result was, sadly, always the same: a flat disc.I had almost given up on my cookie baking when I found this book. I just finished baking up the oatmeal cookie recipe, and they turned out perfectly...just like what I remember from my old days in Orange County. There didn't seem to be enough of the ingredients including sugar and flour when I was making the recipe, but what do I know, the recipe turned out a beautifully plump batch of cookies. I am going to try a cake next and report back. What a thrill to successfully bake again..."
1,The Recipies are Failures,"I moved from sea level to over 7000 ft. I was a very talented baker. But none of my sea level recipes work at the new altitude. I was hoping this book would help me find a way to adjust my recipes. It does not . The 4 recipes I did try from this book tasted like dirt. I did follow the recipe fully and had high hopes. I moved from the USA to the mountains of Mexico. Not only does it take longer to cook any thing at a higher altitude, flavor is lost at a higher altitude and needs adjustment. This book does not explain that.I can not tell anyone to purchase this cook book and expect to be able to bake successfully at high altitudes."
4,high Altitude cook book,"I purchased a cookbook for high altitude cooking that was written at the University of Colorado.My son lives in Colorado and has taken an interest in bread baking. The cookbook came just in time, and he has used it a lot and loves it. He was a little disappointed in that it did not have a pizza recipe, but has tried several other recipes in the book and was very pleased with them."
4,Small but practical,This book is just what my Mom & I needed to learn how to adapt recipes in Northern Arizona from sea level.
5,12 inch round griddle,"This was a good buy: Good price (around $50), nice size, no need to grease, butter, or oil. Only negative is that the edge is low so omelets have to be made one at a time."
1,Very disappointed,"Before buying this griddle pan for my new Induction cooktop, I checked with All Clad and the vendor from whom it was purchased. I was promised that this pan would work with my new cooktop. It does NOT!!! I threw away the box and cannot return it which is very disappointing. It is advertised online as being suitable for all cooktops, including Inductions. Do not believe it!"
1,MADE IN CHINA,"I purchased this for the All-Clad name because this company makes everything in Pennsylvania, or so I thought. They actually make MOST things in Pennsylvania. When this arrived, the box cleary said Made in China, Hecho en ChineReturned for a refund.So if you do not mind preparing your family's food on products Hecho en Chine, then by all means, buy this."
2,More than you want to know about the writer's life,"Presenting obviously autobiographical information as fiction is both indiscreet and unfair. It is indiscreet because the ""characters"" in this ""fiction"" had a legitimate expectation that their private interactions with Justine Levy would stay that way. It is unfair because they can't defend themselves against unflattering portrayals of themselves in fiction.In spite of being unseemly airing of family dirty linen, or perhaps because of it, this book is passable airplane reading. To her credit, the author attempts neither to make her alter ego attractive nor to portray the husband who leaves her in too harsh a light. In fact, by the end of the book, I found myself wondering how he put up with her for so long."
1,DON'T BOTHER,THIS IS THE WORST CORDLESS I HAVE EVER OWNED . LOUSY RECEPTION BATTERY I CAN'T FIND TO REPLACE WHICH DID NOT LAST VERY LONG. GO WITH UNIDEN MUCH BETTER QUALITY AND VALUE.......
1,Low Battery Life,"Do not buy this phone. After 2 months of using the phone, the battery life has deterioriated to 15 minutes of talk time - even after charging it all night. The answering machine is not user friendly. To remove a message, you have to do it before it ends."
2,Ehh...,"The best thing about this movie is it sticks with the original ending rather than the My Fair Lady ending. Other than that... I made it through the movie but I could think of roughly a dozen more pleasurable ways to spend my evening. The acting was so-so, much of the humor simply wasn't funny, and some interesting interpretations of the scene. Granted, if you're looking for something to watch while folding laundry it's not so bad."
4,Stages of a Passage,"The process of writing of ""A Passage to India"" stretched over a decade. Forster began to write the book immediately after his first trip to India in 1912 but abandoned his work more or less one third into the novel. Years spent in Alexandria did not give him the necessary inspiration to take up writing, it happened only when the writer revisited India in 1922. On his return (nagged mercilessly by Leonard Woolf) Forster rewrote the existing drafts and completed the novel.This volume makes little sense with its complimentary volume the elusive Abinger Edition of ""A Passage to India"" - one can hardly read the novel from excerpts, corrections, changes, textual variants. If you put them together it invites you to a marvellous voyage, tracking back the path that lead to the creation of Forster's masterpiece."
1,"WARNING _ Same book, different title!!!","When I received this book (""Seriously Comic Fantasy""), I thought the stories looked familiar. They are. The contents are IDENTICAL with my copy of ""Mammoth Book of Comic Fantasy II"". The difference is that CFII was published by Carroll & Graf in NY, while Seriously Comic Fantasy was published two years later by Constable Publishers in London with the same cover but different title.If you already have CFII, be warned!!!"
2,Not compatible with newer oprerating systems,"My youngest really wanted this so dispite its lack of listing Windows 7 as a system, I decided to take a chance. No go, it will not run on Windows 7-even in compatibility modes. I ended up having to install it on a older computer running XP. The game works, but with it would be nice to update the description with, "" This wil not run on Windows 7 or newer"""
2,Router has problems,Problems with parental control feature of this router causes the router to reboot randomly or lock up or lose it's own login page. Zyxel has known about issues for 6 months. If your thinking of using this feature think again. You can search the forums on the site DSLREPORTS for Zyxel HS-100w for more infomation.
2,Parental Control require subscription,"To keep parental controls enabled over the trial period, one must purchase an icard - which runs in the $70 range per annum. This wasn't disclosed anywhere when I purchased my HS-100W."
1,This router lacks essential features,"If you want to be able to access your computers from the internet, this router will not work for you. When you access your IP from the internet, you get the router's configuration page. Otherwise, this router seemed to be unreliable, and the parental controls did not even support fast-user switching on your computers (for either Windows or Mac)! Overall, it is a poor product and I returned it as fast as I could."
2,ZyXEL doesn't seem to care about the problems,"Problems with Parental control ruin an otherwise mediocre router. While it can work, it reboots itself randomly. ZyXEL technical support listens, but does very little to resolve the problems."
3,Its ok but there is better,"This is not a bad compilation and has some good to influential house songs. However for value and getting a lot of these songs (such as finally or Gypsy Woman) and more I suggest buying the ""Anthems of House"" compilation by MOS. It is 3 cds, was only released a year after this album and is superior."
2,Not exactly what the Title suggest,When looking at the title one expect fire works ( best old classic house music) but it is not what it suggests.
3,I Love The Ball,"I love the ball, but I followed the height and size (55cm). It was too small I have to go get a 65cm. I also bought with it the ""Fat to Firm Fitness Ball Workout for Dummies"" It was a great workout. Other than getting the size wrong I love the ball."
5,Love it,I have lower back problems. My PT suggested i buy a stability ball to do some core strength exercises. I love this ball!Wish it came with a booklet of exercises.Glad it has it's own pump.
2,Received Defective,"I really like the look of this steering wheel because i have the mats to match, but when I purchased it from you guys, I received it with her eye drawn in with a pen which was very appauling to me, i was very upset. So I sent it back and purchased the item from another vendor."
4,Betty Boop Steering Wheel cover,Bought as a gift. It is what it is. It will please the Betty Boop fan.
3,She's done it again!,"This book provides yet another example of Michelle's intellect, integrity, and scholarship. The complete absence of any trace of those three qualities in her writing is simply remarkable."
5,A Conservative Classic,It's sure to keep your wingnut lips moving until the new Anne Coulter book due in '06!!!
2,I was born in Korea and this book embarrasses me,"Even though I was born in Korea, this book made me nauseus. I consider myself 100% red-blooded American, yet Michelle seems to excel at a brand of hate and bigotry that I haven't seen for some time. Please don't blame all Asian Americans for this kind of disgusting display."
4,Humor in its subtlety,"Without trying to go for guffaws or the lowest form of humor - sarcasm, Malkin makes us laugh at the absurdity found in the views of American Leftists. Great book, even if you are a Leftist."
1,"Light on fact, heavy on spite","Sorry, this one just doesn't cut it. One could have a field day debunking Malkin's central theme---that liberals are a bunch of loud-mouthed kooks. This is ugly, distorted stuff. Not even fun on a campy level. (And it doesn't help that her cover undermines her own point, since it is as shrill as the people she attempts to smear).But I'm sure the folks at Fox News will treat it as gospel."
1,Why did I bother,Malkin switches sides here. She had writtent the same thing about conservatives. But that was before she had O'Reily shilling for her.
5,Excellent book,Michelle Malkin tells it like it is. She gets to the heart of the right and wrong politicians are doing.
1,This is the end...,"With the publication of Ms. Malkin's new book, like Peter Schweitzer's newest, we see the neoconservative movement in its ""last throes, if you will"" (thanks, Dick!), reduced to ad hominem attacks, dubious charges of ""hypocrisy"" and shoddy scholarship. The Bush administration is bereft of ideas, of critical thinking, of morality in general. Ms. Malkin can offer nothing to reform, reawaken, or renew her movement; all she has is thrown feces. If I had a mind to, I wouldn't wanna be like you (thanks Alan Parsons!)"
1,Michelle Malkin gone wild and crazy !,"If I want a conservative to talk to, Michelle Malkin ain't one of them. Unless Michelle Malkin is from another planet, she must have been on prozac to even think that liberals have gone wild. Today's conservatives have gone wild and radical but she's too hateful to even think about it. Soak this book in Pine Sol before you read it or it won't make sense !"
1,anchor babies,"Mrs. Malkin makes me sad, because she acts like she doesn't like immigrants. She talks about babies with parents from other countries like they are trash. In school we learn about the statue of liberty and she doesn't seem to agree."
1,The Life Cycle of the Remora,"Another parasite feeding off the leavings of much more substantial species. Or perhaps a more apt ocean-related metaphor would be comparing Malkin's ""work"" to that of the brainless bivalves that cluster around sewer outflows, or the mindless jellyfish who flow with the ocean currents. But like the ocean, neo-cons' writings should be taken with more than a grain of salt.By the way, the reviewer below who wants someone named McCracken reported to Amazon. I'm sure you can take it. Instead, why don't you campaign for a zero-star feature for reviews. Or perhaps a fact-checking service for publishers of political vitriol like this work of fiction. I sure hope no public money has been spent on stuff like this."
1,Junior High Mentality,This book makes clear how far someone will go to put cash in their pocket. Let's stop attacking each other.
1,Her best yet!,"Michelle's never been ""on"" like this before. Definitely the best cover of any of her books. It's so cute."
1,And it's a Regnery!,"We live in a society in which hate has become a marketable commodity. Enter Malkin, whose mastery of the genre would be complete if she wasn't such a pedestrian writer. Sad person."
2,Failure,"I saw Malkin on TV and I couldn't believe that a professional political analyst could sound ike such a fool. What could be worse? Her book! I give this two stars because she tries, but that's just being generous. If you must read, use your public library."
1,Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"Does anyone actually care what Michelle Malkin (or her ghost-writer husband) think? I got this book as a gag gift for Christmas and I actually tried to read it before I realized that not only was it appallingly written, but it was completely devoid of factual information.Poor Michelle. Your fifteen minutes are ticking away.Tick...tick...tick..."
1,Hold Up A Mirror...,"...and you'll see why Michelle Malkin throws out the hate. She just can't quit hating others, and never stops to think why."
1,What a waste of time and trees...,"I read my sister's copy; she was using Malkin's data - which is only half (and a partially falsified half, at that) of the story - to try to make me believe that conservatives are better people than liberals. 'Fraid not. Anyone who uses Google could shred Malkin's ""facts"" and inferences in about 10 min. flat.If Malkin practiced what she preaches, she would have NOTHING to say. She's not a journalist, or even a very good writer. She's a propagandist."
1,Ugh,Here we have a person of color who makes her living spouting propoganda for people who desipse her. It would be sad is she wasn't such an opportunist and Coulter wanna-be. Her statements are getting nuttier and nuttier so she obviously aspires to that level of idiocy.
1,typical hysterical conservative nonsense,"There are intellegent conservatives out there, who present arguments with some consideration of rational logical thought. But if you like moronic name calling, this is the book for you."
1,Incoherent,"I haven't been able to stomach reading the entire book, but what I have read is pretty darn incoherent. It's a strange and nasty little screed with a lot of made up ""facts"" and bizarre anecdotes. Other than informing us that Ms. Malkin doesn't like liberals (which, I believe, we already knew), it doesn't seem to have any particular purpose as it rambles along. Stuff like this should be e-published because a lot of paper will be wasted after the book languishes for a while on the remainder table."
2,Guaranteed to drop your IQ by 15 per cent,"I must admit that I just couldn't finish this shrill book. Malkin makes the harpies sound like English opera singers. Books that kick liberals around have been in style for several years now, and, God knows, there's a lot to kick them around for. It is as if they wear signs on their tails that say, ""Kick me please."" At the same time, Malkin's book is like trying to eat an ice cream cone with 12 scoops on it. You might be able to do it, but you will feel sick at the end. Not only that, at the end of the day you end up wondering about the sincerity of, as well as the potential depth of the stupidity of, people who obsess on liberals. Perhaps they should start looking at their own demons."
1,False Light,"Malkin has been trumpeting this book as an expose of crazy liberals in power, but it turns out to be nothing more than the tales of some crazy kids who just happen to be liberals. there are just as many stories of conservative youths and activists, but people have better things to do with their time than find write about John Smith from Bumblescum, USA who yelled something rude to someone with a Bush/Cheney sticker. Get over yourself, Malkin, your book offers nothing."
1,"Well, what can I say","I like to read books from both sides of the isle. It gives a person a better chance of truly knowing what is going on with in the political parties. My problem with many of the political books out there is that many of the authors continue to ""lump"" everyone into the same category. Life isn't like that. People aren't like that. Everyone thinks independently, and each side has it's own extremists. I didn't even make it half way through this book before I trashed it. Though, I will say, MM is not nearly as painful to read as Ann Coulter."
1,Lies by Omission,"It's certainly odd that she constantly refers those who don't agree with her end of the political spectrum in the most vile and despicable way. What she doesn't mention about right-wing attacks on everyone who ISN'T in the right-wing clique could fill many more volumes than this scatological screed. As others have suggested, you can receive almost identical anecdotes and apocryphal ""reporting"" on most AM radio stations. Save your money."
1,And the point is....,"While many of Michelle's observations and anecdotes are oftentimes hilarious, it is equally hilarious and obsurd to somehow presume that only one political ideology (something even more general and amorphous than an actual poltiical party) is guity of one-sided ""wildness."" That is, ad hominem attacks, bizarre leaps in logic, and overall irrational beliefs. It's all the more puzzling that this book was written by Malkin, who is one of the more vitriolic political pundits writing today. It is obsurd to quote Sean Peann and say that his words represent all ""liberals"" and the beliefs of ""liberalism."" It would be equally obsurd to say Pat Roberton's remarks about assassinating the president of Venezuela as belonging to Republicans and conservatives in general. Indeed, if any such remark was made, Malkin would be the first to pounce on it, and likely attribute it to the liberal media."
1,Disappointing,"Again, this is Michelle Malkin we're talking about. So instead of 'disappointing' I should probably say 'right on track'. It was difficult to get through this book as an independant. It's pretty pathetic that instead of facts and sourced data, she relies on venomous, juvenile remarks to 'debate' her opponents. If you are a free-thinking individual that wants intelligent discourse and statements backed up with facts, then this is probably not for you. If, however, you are a lock-step Bush fan who thinks torture is great and Saddam caused 9/11, you'll probably be at home here. And as far as I know, I have not seen this kind of vitriol on the Left, what I see on the left is biting sarcasm, but with this administration, I think a healthy does of that is warrented."
4,This is a fine book about the insanity of modern politics,"The radicals have bulldozed their way into mainstream American politics, and it is hurting discourse and debate in this country on very serious issues.I recommend this book as a medium guide for people seeking clearer waters in the choppy seas of modern hate mongering- got ya politics.Good read- two thumbs up for Michelle Malkin."
4,A Valuable Expose,"This book was not the comprehensive critique or root-cause analysis of liberals-gone-wild, but it did serve as a valuable expose of unhinged behavior we might not have known about. In that regard, it has more in common with books on media bias such as written by Bernie Goldberg, than with in-depth reporting or analysis from people like Mark Steyn or Thomas Sowell. Still, it was very informative and well-written so I give it four stars."
1,Thinly-disquised hatespeech,"Michelle Malkin brays loudly in this one-note screed that liberals are 'slashinging your tires' etc, etc, bark bark bark.It's divisive hogwash, aimed at bottomfeeders and has absolutely no facts.Give it a pass, you'll be able to buy it at used bookstores for under a dollar - in under a month."
2,Michelle Malkin's Unhappy Book,"While I greatly admire Michelle Malkin and highly prize all of her words, I am sorry to see this book in print because of the very foul language repeated by her many offenders. I am sure that this world is filled with many deranged morons who will not hesitate to attack verbally anyone with strong political views, and to use such languages and thoughts that have dominated their own pitiful past experiences.However, I do not recommend this book for reading to anyone but the most callous social scientist of adult age and strong convictions.Some things that humans say are so pitiful that we who are so misfortunate to have to hear or see them should just forget what was said and move on, sort of like ""brushing the dust off our sandals"" when visiting an unworthy city.Again, I hold Michelle Malkin in the highest respect, but I do not recommend this book. It should have been throughly edited or never printed at all."
1,You do not even have to read this book,"Liberals are crazy, Conservatives are perfect, Liberals control the media, Conservatives are unfairly represented in the media etc....Internment defender Malkin is a liar pure and simple."
1,Illiterate,Truly silly and foolish. Now don't you folks who admire this lair start saying: Did you read the book? yes I did and it's completely false and stupid!!!
1,About What You'd Expect,"I found this book to be poorly reasoned and sloppily written. If you're primed to like it, you will like it."
1,Waste of Time,"A very simplistic book void of meaningful content. The best political books do not pander so gleefully to partisan politics but seek to understand the fundamental positions of each side, wether they agree or not."
1,Been done to death.,Hasn't this book been written about a thousand times already? It seems the wingnuts take turns writing the same book over and over.
1,"Poorly written, elemental tripe","This book is another attack on the Democratic party from the right. It is shrill, pointless and scary. When the government has a majority, it's puppets in the media feel it their right to attack the minority with impunity. Forget that the country has come around to a Progressive viewpoint. If you're going to call a group of people unhinged, perhaps you should look into your own hinges first to make sure everything is buttoned up tight."
5,To correct an error is a review above...,"""This is the woman who went on Hardball before the election and declared that she believed John Kerry shot himself on purpose in Vietnam..."" She never said anything of the sort. This writer shares the confusion Chris Mathews showed when he went apoplectic at the phrase ""self inflicted"". No wonder Liberals are so often confused, they don't understand the language.Malkin said Kerry was accused by his fellow officers (and I have no idea who's correct here, Kerry or his fellow officers) of receiving a Purple Heart for shrapnel received from his own grenade that he, himself had tossed into a rice bin (his own report said he used the grenade in this fashion). What Mathews and the nutcase above don't understand is that ""self-inflicted"" doesn't necessarily mean you did it on purpose. Neither Malkin or anyone else ever accused Kerry of injuring himself on purpose."
5,What??,[...] I found the book entertaining. It also is quite an indictment on politics as it stands today. Both the right and left have embarked on this course of ridiculous partisanship without regard to what is actually happening. The author has collected some pretty outrageous stories and presented them in an entertaining way.
1,More Brownshirt Lies Destined for the Remainder Bin,"Ya gotta love someone complaining about racism who has made a career out of defending one of the most shameful episodes of racial injustice in our nation's history. Can you say ""chickens come home to roost,"" dearie? Howzabout ""if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen""?Ms. Magalang (who has also made a big issue out of female leftist writers who have changed their last names to ""deny"" their racial heritage) has produced that favorite of the right-wing easy money hack: a cut and paste job with minimal comments addedTake the money and run, baby!Once the bulk sales die off, you'll be able to pick this up at your local Dollar Store. Why would you want to, you ask? Well, as a wise man once said, you can't prop open a window with a paperback."
1,Clever but Worthless,"Michelle Malkin is the cute, clever kid in class with a lousy childhood and big resentments, who tries extra hard to annoy people so she will be noticed. She's good with words and has a knack for turning cute, derogatory phrases, but has nothing of overall value to say. Anyone who wastes their money on this book is just encouraging her to continue, like feeding a stray dog encourages it to hang around the house. Malkin is to 21st Century American politics what flatulance is to a dinner party.""Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."""
1,ANOTHER Expensive Piece of Toilet Paper,"Dearest Readers,Why would you spend money on something you can already get for free? Most of the ""unhinged"" liberal stories she tells in this book can be found in her blog archives at michelle malkin dot com. The pictures of the so called ""wacko"" libs are there along with the news stories she compiled to ""write"" this tissu, er, I mean ""book"".Be a good conservative and pick up some of William F. Buckley or George Will tomes. Again, high quality, conservative thought even a progressive like me can respect.You'd be ""unhinged"" to even buy this fancy toilet paper from Malkin!"
1,Michelle Malkin is a Great American!,"I love Michelle Malkin! What an awesome book! She's right about rounding up all them Arabs, Muslims and liberals and placing them in concentration camps. And then, forcing them to watch Fox News and listen to Rush Limbaugh. That's what I do and that's why I believe Saddam was behind 9-11 and the GOP is really looking out for the underdogs like myself who work at Wal-Mart"
5,Terrific DVD,"I had no idea how really gifted Julia Child was as a chef until I watched this DVD of her technique. It was so inspirational watching her make croissants from scratch and soufflés. All of her recipes are rendered with such charm, making this disc irresistible. She really does make people want to learn not only how to cook but how to cook better. I recall my Mom watching her back in the 70's and feverishly writing down her recipes so she could try them out on us. They were always so delicious. No wonder I thought my Mom was the greatest cook; she was imitating Julia Child week after week.Thanks, Julia. You've made the culinary world more understandable for the average person and much more enjoyable."
5,A joy to watch,"It's so wonderful to have video archive of Julia's first shows. She really inspired me to start cooking, like the rest of the country. I will treasure these recordings. Unlike today's pale imitations, Julia really taught you HOW to cook. To her cooking wasn't drudgery but a joy. I heartily recommend all her videos to people who are not into ""fast food"" but real food prepared with a loving heart and joie de vivre."
2,Misleading description,The description states that the phone has an answering system. It does not. It also has limited ringtone options making it very difficult to distiguish between the two lines. Other than that it's great.
1,Phoneuser,"Reception is terrible - lots of interference. Battery life is just awful. Lasted about 1.5 hrs when first bought, now, 4 months later, lasts 30 min. BIG WASTE OF MONEY."
2,Not What Expected!!!,"I bought two of these phones ,after a month in one phone i had problems like ,Static And button problem, and in the other one i am having the battery problem, i have to keep the handset on the base all the time.not worth spending $$$ for this Cheap phone,definitly not what expected."
4,Very Indy,"Strays is very gritty and authentic, it's what independent film festivals thrive on. Vin stretches his acting and directing muscles (even his singing muscles! It is almost worth buying the DVD for those few minutes!). It's a bit riske at times, to the point of being unpleasantly real, but very entertaining and genuine. It makes me miss the 90's."
1,Strays,This movie was a true letdown - our whole family usually love VinDiesel movies - this movie is not even fit for adults to watch- it ends horribly-and through out the whole movie you just wait and hope for a story line- waste of time to watch
5,Insightful & Inspiring,"The author, Amanda Kipp, really brings to life the potential threats that the electronic society brings to the Internet-driven consumer world. This article is just as pertinent today as in 1999. Kudos to Kipp, and I'll continue reading her work!"
5,Great Anime,"This is a great anime to watch. Frankly I didn't enjoy this as much as some of Shinkai's other works, but that is also a very high bar upon which to judge it. You will not mind watching this quite a few times and taking something unique away from it on each viewing. Also, this is a great story that I think both 20 something men and women can relate to, so its a good date movie."
1,SLOWWWWWWW,"Did you wonder what this title means? 5 cm per second? Well let me tell you what it means. It's SLOWWW at a speed of 5 cm per second. I can feel it moving so slowly that I just about fell asleep. If I had a booger, I'd throw it at it-that's how much I hate it. One star for poetic language and graphics."
1,What a waste of 60 minutes.,This one's just awful! I've never seen a more vivid piece of trash in all my life. This Shinkai character really is the 'next Miyazaki'.
4,Buy or Rent? That Depends...,"I dont own this movie yet I watched it online via an anime movie website to see if i wanted to own it. For me I was nice, touching, real, yet a little hard to follow the last episode. Altogether a nice movie beautiful animation I wouldnt say it is for all. So preview it first via an online website or see if its available for rent somewhere and then determine if its worth buying to you."
2,Not bad but Hayao Miyazaki is much better,"I read the reviews and most people thought the director was better than Miyazaki, NO WAY.It has three chapters and the first two were kind of sad, but made sense. The last chapter was really sad and a little confusing. I know many animes have somewhat sad or not really satisfying endings, but this was one of the worst endings ever. I wouldn't bother buying this one, maybe if it's free on youtube or something, but don't bother buying it.Hayao Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli' is so much better."
2,2cm? Incomplete,"This appears to be an incomplete episodic series made for TV. As such the first two parts (episodes) work, the third seems to be bits and pieces cobbled together to fill up a DVD disc. It's a shame, really because the story line, for what there is of it, and the artwork are top notch. Perhaps someone else will take a stab at bringing the novel to the screen because it is a great love story."
2,No thanks,"No thank you, I won't be having seconds. I already own the original Ebony cookbook so I picked this one up with high expectations. What a let down! The New Ebony cookbook is full of bland recipes that I will never try. Considering that the orignal book is a treasury of Americas finest Black cooking there is no excuse for this new version to be so poor. Stick with the original."
1,Price Issue,"The deal Amazon is offering is to purchase The New Ebony Cookbook and Soul Food: Classic Cuisine from the Deep South for $23.02. But if I purchase them each seperately I only pay $21.53. Isn't a deal supposed to be a better offer, not more."
5,This is one of my all time favorites.,I read this book in Junior High School (which feels like a verylong time ago now) and have not forgotten it. I started looking for acopy to purchase about a year ago and haven't been able to find it yet! This is the kind of heart-warming story that every young reader should have on his or her bookshelf.
5,Truly a classic!,"This book will be lost somewhere in my growing list of 'favorites' for a long time. Amazingly well-written; I'm surprised it can't be purchased here. The perspective was completely unique (any cetacean lover will enjoy it) and the plot was exceedingly engaging. Steve Senn has created resilient characters and by the end of the novel you find yourself thinking of them in terms of actual people. Compelling and charmingly captivating, the book actually has something to say to the world. It truly deserves the five stars I gave it!"
4,A Police Perspective by Art Hogenson,"As a former police officer this was not always easy to read. That is because better police work might have prevented this tragedy. Even serial killers can be lucky at times, as this story points out. The story also points out that victims can play a role in bringing about some measure of justice, and that not giving up can be rewarded.The author, an attorney, doesn't spare us from the failings of the criminal justice system, and there are many in this story. He also doesn't spare us from the grief and fear a family goes through when the killer and motive for the crime aren't known for a long time.Justice for Marlys is a fast paced, easy read, but one you will long remember. And what this story brings home for me is a message police officers at all levels need to be reminded of, that police work is not just another job, anymore then brain surgery is just another job. It is very important that it be done well."
5,Madeleine E. Robins' Point of Honor,"Setting, plot and especially character all excellently crafted in this first novel in the Miss Sarah Tolerance series. You'll believe a woman can be a PI in Regency England. The second novel in the series, Petty Treason, is equally good. Here's a bit of dialogue from the second:---""Debts of honor--"" Miss Tolerance began, half to herself.""Oh, well, yes."" Glebb was disapproving. ""Gentlemen and them, they're all for blowing each other's head off for a farthing. It's not the way of good business.""---Can't argue with that, can you? You can't resist reading more, either."
4,Point of Honour,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I was caught from the first sentence. Anyone who can start a book with an amusing Jane Austen reference is a winner to me. Fans of the era and of historical mystery, please don't let the creepy, apparition-like appearance of the pistol-wielding woman on the cover deter you. The writing is good.Robins makes her home in an alternate universe, with Queen Charlotte the Regent instead of the Prince of Wales, and the Prince of Wales a widower to a Catholic (and thus removed from the succession). The alternate history makes an interesting twist which I hope will be taken further in future novels starring Sarah Tolerance. Overall, a fun historical mystery that is a delight to read on the train and after a long day of work. If you like the Regency era, I highly recommend the book."
4,Point of Honor,"This is a good book with an interesting heroine. Sarah Tolerance has led an unusual life and is an independent woman in a time that probably didn't allow for the type of career she has. Still, the story is interesting with lively characters like her aunt who is a madam of a brothel. Petty Treason, the book that follows is equally as good. Since both books are good, why have there been no more stories about Sarah Tolerance?"
4,London's Mean Streets,"If this book were a movie, it would be film noir. Sarah Tolerance shares a kinship with Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade. Brava!"
4,Deceptive,"While I agree with all of the laudable reveiws of Point of Honor, I must point out that the reviewers who said there was a ""bit of romance"" and a ""nice romance at its core"" were deceptive. I very much enjoy a good mystery, but I also feel that a love story adds to the mystery, especially if the book is one in a series of continuing characters. For the next person who may pick up this book and feels as I do, be warned that the romance ends in betrayal and tragedy. I can't help feeling that the author has lost at least one reader (this one) in making the main character suffer so. For those readers who love the mystery for itself and like a book set in Regency England, this book is exceptional - so read on!"
4,A great read despite the formula,"After reading a dozen inane romance novels, how wonderful it was to stumble across Leigh Greenwood's Cowboys series! He uses tight plots, interesting characters, balanced couples, and the atmosphere of the West seems to spark every scene. They are a delight to read -- with one caveat. Space out your reading, for apparently they all have the same general plot, even the same sex scene. After reading three at once, I was able to point to sections in the fourth book and say, ""covetous neighbor introduced here,"" ""first sex scene here,"" ""kidnapping here,"" and know that the woman would say ""please"" during the sex, which seems to consist of the same foreplay each time. It's fine to have a formula if it works well, and Mr. Greenwood's formula certainly does! Again, I emphasize how exciting and well-written (and crafted) his books are. But just don't read them all together or you'll get a serious case of deja vu."
2,I'm bored already and I haven't finished Sean of the Cobwoy Series,"I agree with one of the reviews, I loved ""Seven Brides"" a whole lot better than what I've read of the Cowboy Series. I also agree with the comment ""space them out""....I love Leigh Greenwood's writing, it's interesting and teaches me things I didn't know, not being born in America I literally knew/know nothing about the Civil War and the history of the West. So from that standpoint it's an interesting read. I do feel that the story of Sean drags on and on and I do not believe that Sean and Pearl are a good match, the plot seems to have been dragged across the pages."
1,Disappointing,"Leigh Greenwood started us off with a great story in the series the Cowboys, with Jake she has created wonderful characters, with the potential of some great reading. I liked Ward, Buck, Chet, what happened to Sean? She made a buffoon out of him. Come on if your just going to mass produced books to keep on with the series stop now...The boys all have wonderful strong personalities but you would never know it with Sean. Also his closest friend Pete you'd never know from this story they were, or the strong family ties with the Maxwells and all the boys. Read the first chapter and the last two chapters and you'll have the story such as it is. Leigh Greenwood owes her readers an apology for this one."
1,Great belt - for NON A/C ENGINES,This is for non A/C vehicles. It will NOT fit if you have A/CDon't make the mistake I did.
2,weak lyrics,"I listened to this expecting some good beats, lyrics, or at the least a good message; It's all weak though!! It was a huge dissapointment."
2,Disappointing,"Take this review with a grain of salt, as outside from E-Roc and Lil' Raskull I am not generally a fan of any that Grapetree has to offer. That being said, I think this album is one of their worst productions. Perhaps it's his rapping style, perhaps it's his slower beats, but I would strongly recommend that you preview this album before picking it up."
3,"Decent, but hard to set up and not a great fit.","This mobile will not fit all cribs. In fact it only fits one side of ours, a side I would prefer not to have it on, which as a result has it hanging down too low. It was a pain to set up, as you have to thread the dangling ornaments yourself, not easy for the swollen hands of a pregnant mom. Quality is not the greatest either, but this seems to be consistent with Koala Baby."
2,Not worth the price,"When we first started decorating our baby boy's nursury, I though this moblie would be the perfect accent to his moonbeam themed room, This mobile was so simple and had no character to it! I decided on the Fisher Price Nature Wonders Mobile, it had different music and a night light that shines patterns on the ceiling at night it also matches perfectly with the Moonbeam theme. Don't waste your money just because it matches, its not worth it!!!!"
1,worthless!,"I received this as a gift to match the rest of the nursery. We used it only two times before it broke. We could not wind it up after that! Do not waste your money on this...I read the reviews prior to registering for it for my shower and should have listened to the poor reviews but I wanted it to match the nursery perfectly....Even when it did work properly, the music did not last long at all...terrible!"
5,no problem,"My husband and I assembled this mobile in mere minutes:)It fit the crib just fine. Wondering why this mobile recieved only three stars, I read the reviews. I have to disagree with any difficulties listed about the assembly, and perhaps the mobile just happened to fit our crib well. It is adorable!"
2,Cute but too short of a musical cycle,This mobile's musical/turning feature only lasts a short time. It's not practicle if you have to re-start it every few minutes. Not worth the money.
1,Dead in 16 months,"This unit was fine while it lasted, but it suddenly went dead after 16 months. Unfortunately, that seems to be a common occurrence with this model (see comments for white and stainless, too)."
1,Great when working but...,We had this unit three years and it started sparking after a 3 minute use.It died and the inverter was replaced. One week later it died again.The repairman said these units are junk... I agree.
1,If you are after a long term appliance...,"If you are after a long term appliance, this is not the one for you.After 10 mos. of usage, the unit died. Although it was purchased before we began using it, Panasonic was not going to do anything about Warranty.When in operation, the turntable is very loud and the exhaust fan is very noisy unless on low. Operationally, it's does ok. Longevity sucks..."
5,Excellent Bible,"I have this Bible myself and chose to buy another one for my fiancé. It provides wonderful insight/commentary to all of the verse and includes great maps, explanations and charts to aid in your Bible studies. The Concordance in the back is top-notch and I would definitely recommend this Bible to anyone looking for a more in depth way to get into God's word!"
1,Not An Oil Pressure Sensor,ACDelco 213-928 Engine Oil Pressure SensorThe product pictured and sent to me was a temperature sending unit and not an oil pressure sensor.
1,not an oil pressure sensor,amazon got this one wrong-if you need a coolant temp. switch order thisthis is not an oil pressure switch-hello anyone-Beuler-anyone
5,Best Superhero Novel Ever!,"Maybe it's not exactly an overcrowded field (great superhero novels, that is) but this one is the hands-down winner. I loved Tom DeHaven's Derby Dugan trilogy (especially the second one) but this Superman novel even surpasses those three books. For the first time ever in a novel, I really cared about Clark and Lois and Lex. DeHaven's feel for the 1930s era in Kansas and Los Angeles and New York is pitch-perfect, and this is probably the best psychological look at Clark coming to term with his powers. Lex Luthor has never been more callously evil, either. There's also a new character here who I don't think comes from the comics: a scrappy, wisecracking newspaper photographer (not Jimmy Olsen). I can't recommend this book more highly."
5,An Alternative Treat,A thouroughly enjoyable alternative take on the American icon. I hope there is a sequel.
1,Don't waste your time,"Where to start. As the other posts have indicated, Superman hardly appears in the book.""It's Superman"" is the author's self-indulgent attempt at a book written in the pulp or film-noir(book-noir?) style. Consistent name dropping for no other reason than to show off. Some Jazz musicians have more time in the book than Superman.Save your money."
1,It's NOT Superman,"Superman throughout the years has always possessed honesty, intelligence, and the moral center that made him one of the greatest superheroes ever. Comic fans laughingly refer to him as the ""big blue boy scout"" even as they admire his steadfast stand for truth, justice, and the American way. Batman is darker and more complex, but the simplicity of Superman keeps you coming back. There's something we all see in Superman that we wish we saw in yourselves. That said, the Clark Kent/Superman in this book is NOT ANYTHING like that. This Clark Kent is a moron, lacks a moral compass, and has all the appeal of asphalt. Lois Lane comes off like a 1950's good girl gone bad. If you want to experience the real Superman, watch one of the good movies (Superman 1 & 2, and Superman Returns), the animated series, or even ""Smallville"". Listen to ""It's Not Easy To Be Me/Superman"" by Five For Fighting or ""Kryptonite"" by Three Doors Down. But whatever you do, avoid this book like green kryptonite!"
4,A surprisingly classy reinvention of a hero.,"Like when Frank Miller put his personal touch on Batman in the classic Year One telling of Batman's orgins Tom DeHaven puts his own unique spin on Superman making a classic hero fresh again.Set in the 1930's and with a great eye for period detail,a great collection of despicable characters that reminded me of Dick Tracy and some inspired surprises(Clark as a Hollywood stuntman!) this is a truly creative and ambitious novel.It's true that there's not a lot of superheroics here nor a straightforward plot and that the focus often drifts away from Clark Kent to the many other characters.Despite those offputting aspects this is a smart,darkly humorous sometimes just plain nasty entertaining novel that will leave you wanting more."
3,okay book,"the beginning is weird, doesnt follow as other books, husband who is a huge superman fan didnt like it neither did i. but ive seen worse!"
2,Too much focus on stupidity...,"Not quite sure why De Haven wrote this. From Superman confronting Lex Luthor in his socks, to being called ""stupid"" or a ""hick"" by almost every character in the novel, the author obviously wanted to paint him as being quite dim. Even Clark himself complains about his own stupidity, always wishing he were smarter. Nearing the end of the novel, I was expecting something to come out of this. Perhaps a kind of adolescent growing pain, which he outgrows and becomes stronger because if it. Nope.Through this ""coming of age"" story, Clark actually reverts to a whiny, sullen, and downright depressed soul. This is not the Superman we know and love (with character and morals to spare), but just another angst ridden post-teen that openly weeps at the drop of a hat.The book is thoroughly off target, and ultimately depressing. Was this De Haven's intention?"
3,Elmore Leonard Does Superman?,"This book is eerily similar to Elmore Leonard's ""The Hot Kid"" because both books begin with the title characters as young boys, and focus on an encounter each boy has with an FBI Most Wanted gangster. In Leonard's book the gangster gets shot, but in De Haven's book the guy is thrown into a wall after his gun explodes. Really, that's one of the few differences between the books.Both books chronicle how the main characters grow up to become crime-fighters, and feature famous villains, women, and real-life events to set the tone and place. Both books also feature clunky narrative writing that is awkward to read, and at times seems to be all about style and not at all about moving the story forward.The Superman we all know from reading comic books doesn't appear in this book until the very, very end. Overall, it wasn't worth the wait."
5,Images that flow straight into your heart,"In my practice as an animal communicator, I often recommend books to clients seeking indepth information. Because it's a beautiful, gentle introduction to the concepts of animal communication, I suggest this title to more people than any other book. It's also my number one recommendation for people coping with animal companions with serious illnesses or those mourning the passage of their dearest animal friend. By sharing her heart with us, Patty Summers gives her readers hope, joy and a spiritual understanding of the bond between animals and their people."
1,Don't be fooled by the cover,"I did, and this movie really stinks. There's absolutely nothing cool about this, and you won't find anything that can satisfy your piqued interest. The storyline is lame, the acting laughable, and the video quality unacceptably bad. If you feel like collecting suggestive covers like this, buy it. Otherwise, you'll be sorely disappointed. BTW I rented this from Netflix so my loss was relatively small, not counting the hour and a half wasted viewing this POS."
4,Good but for Adults only - NEeds to point at PSX Receiver,"These wireless controllers are excellent IF AND ONLY IF, you point them at the PSX unit where the receiver is and it is very sensitive with its line of site. I recomend them, but nobody can walk in front of you, and you have to always point the controller which means you may not be able to just lay down and play."
1,What!,"I got this controller and I thought the guy who review this was wrong. The controllers work for some games like Football, but racing games they do not. They are alright but you have to have them pointed at the playstaion I enjoy playing with them but they are not great for some games."
3,at least it's not fat possum,"well, what can I say -- at least it's not RL collaborating with a bunch of impotent indie-scenesters. I met a couple of you Fat Possum guys at the juke joint a couple years ago, and, though you seem to be a bunch of ok guys, this techno+RL stuff really has to stop. Rap and blues is a better combination, though only in theory, cause no one's been able to do it successfully! Oh yeah. I'm reviewing an album... It's pretty good stuff. I didn't give it a better score because there are a few better tapes out there, most notably one from Holland and a few scattered tracks on Arhoolie compilations. (and of course, Too Bad Jim -- on Fat Possum before they got wack -- is one of the greatest cd's on earth)"
1,Don't bother,"Unless you are collecting BD related materials just for collectings' sake, do not bother buying this book. It consists of a number of photos with captions...no break down info, no real insight. There are other, more useful 70's books out there...Ozel's...BD in You..Mishkin's Complete Belly Dancer.....Serena's book. This one is a waste of money considering what you will have to spend on an out of print book."
3,Fort Worth bought at Amazon's Western Movie Site,This trio was bought for a birthday present for a fan of oldie westerns and was a 100% hit - not seen by recipient for fifty years so it was so exciting. Thanks for this. Excellent shipping and delivery service too!
4,Convenience item works well,These individual packages make it possible to avoid mixing ingredients to be used in the nasal irrigator. Avoid mess and irritation.
5,Super Gripper,This product works fine. It has rough edges but smoothing would add to the cost. Recommended. Good value for the price.
3,A series of essays on women,A strong set of essays of women and how they have developed over the years and explanations of which socities where they are suppressed.
4,Great backup for your old home videos.,"We had tons of old home videos which were deteriorating rapidly. After doing a lot of research, we bought the Zenith XBR413. It is fairly easy to use and the end product is great. The DVD's we have produced play beautifully on our other DVD players AND the computer. Just make sure you use the right DVD media as stated in the product specs. It also works in reverse, copying your homemade DVD's to videotape for those family members that do not have access to a DVD player. My only complaint is that the process of adding a title to the DVD takes a little time as it is done with the assistance of your remote by selecting the letters for your title from the onscreen alphabet."
2,Zenith XBR413 Won't play DVD,We bought this a year ago and all was ok until now. I have some DVDs that I have played in this before and now they won't play. The audio plays but not the video. The disk plays on other machines so it's ok. I called Zenith but they couldn't help me.
2,Won't play on other DVD players,"This product was easy to use, but the DVD's I created would only play on the Zenith product! It doesn't work on computers and other DVD players"
5,Chafing Dish,"Purchased this for my daughter in law, gave her the larger rectangular version about a year ago. She loved the first unit, but actually likes this smaller round version more. It is more practical and will get much more use than the large unit in her opinion. If my daughter-in-law likes it, I like it. Robert L Brewer."
2,Go to the source,"Anyone familiar with Peter Drucker's writings will probably be disappointed with this book. Drucker is a better and more provocative writer. Anyone not familiar with Drucker's writings probably won't appreciate the Drucker ""world"" and might even be deterred from reading Drucker himself, which would be a shame. The best part of the book discusses Drucker's relationship with Albert Sloan Jr. at GM. The worst part of the book has to be the irritating manner in which Beatty incorporates quotes and fragments from Drucker's writings. At times, Beatty's only contributions seem to be a horde of ""ands,"" ubiquitous ellipses, and trite summations."
2,"save money, buy a Drucker original","The GWU/Richmond book club found this book tedious and hard to read. The author seemed more intent on demonstrating his extensive vocabulary than in protraying Drucker. He (the author) came off as pompous, and lost several readers in the first chapter. Those of us who plowed through the book found the Drucker quotes to be, by far, the best part."
2,A history book,"This book gives you glimpses of the influence Drucker has had on society. But, unless you are looking for a biography, I do not recommend this book. It is dry and tedious to read."
4,A Good Read!,"Peter Drucker's philosophies and theories have shaped management all over the world. Drucker is highly respected. He has always taught that people are an organization's most important resource. In 1954, Drucker virtually invented 'management.' Although, of course, management existed before, nobody had ever treated it as a distinct field.Jack Beatty's book about Peter Drucker is not just another biography. Beatty criticizes Drucker in some areas and extols his virtues in others. The book is sometimes entertaining and consistently well written. Enough of Drucker's ideas are included to make you want to read his books. Most of the book summarizes Drucker's work chronologically. Company leaders who want their top people to learn about management should make this required reading. We [...] recommend this book to managers in all industries."
4,Interesting Papers on Little-known Lowland Papuan Peoples,"This book contains 12 papers on the culture of such little-known West Papuan ethnic groups as the Isirawa, Berik and Tabla of the north coast, the Bauzi and the Iaw of the northern interior plains and the the Wandame and Mairasi living on the coast at the ""Bird's Neck"".All but one are in English.The contents would deserve 5 stars, but unfortunately the book was not only printed in a very unattractive matter (looking like a collection of typed manuscripts) but was so poorly bound that pages started falling out the 3rd time I opened it! :-("
3,A delicate subject cooked overlong,"It's sad that this film is written like a term paper on ""my dad"" because Aiyana Elliott's dad is so interesting and the rest of the characters (especially her obviously talented mother) are a TRIP to watch. If only she didn't spend so much of the film panning the country roads as her deadpan voiceover (sounding as though she were standing in front of the classroom reading a book report) dominated. Just give us Ramblin Jack, his crazy womenfolk and his great guitar-strummin and that would have been enough!On another note, I did realize why he wasn't a bigger star -- on the footage shown of him and Johnny Cash playing together, Cash's rhythm was so much more clear and his playing just spot-on in comparison to the tonal and rhythmic laziness of Ramblin Jack Elliott. That's something that causes people to switch off the music after a while, even if they don't understand why."
3,He made himself over,"The son of a Jewish doctor became a folksinging legend. He took up where Woodie Guthrie left off.The movie would be better if it wasn't about a daughter telling her father's storyand he was just not the family, settling down type?He seems to have married more than once with really mixed results.It is kind of slow and not a very linear history of a folk singerwho learned his craft by hard workand his reputation by singing a long time."
3,Now I Know Why He's Called RAMBLIN' Jack,"It's to stay one jump ahead of women like these. Jack nails it in the beercan episode commentary. Jack left home and never looked back because he is precisely the hen-peckable type. Falls into every female trap and has no other recourse than to run.Solid content, apart from appalling camera work -- especially in the ""performance"" segments.The scenes of whining women are close to intolerable. I really could have done without the daughter's input. . . and that ubiquitous ex-wife. . . whew!Ramble, Jack. For God's sake man, RAMBLE. Get out now!"
4,Interesting.,"Oh lets see... most of the negative reviewers complain about the so called right wing bias of this particular book.Lets try reading the title: ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science""This book is neither right or left wing, despite the protestations of various persons, -- at least one of which decided to spam their blog in their ""review"" How sad.But in any case, this book attacks ""scientific"" propaganda propagated by both the left and right of the political spectrum.It's worth a read."
1,Right-wing propaganda,"If you want to read some excellent science writing, skip this. If you enjoy right wing propaganda read this book and all the others in the serious. For excellent science writing, read The Beak of The Finch, The Botany of Desire, or Ominvore's Dilemma."
1,his wife says it's a great book!!!,"it's a sad day for an author when he has to have a 5 star rating to achieve 3 stars in reader reviews.it's a sadder day when the reason his book gets panned so often is that it is biased, dishonest and manipulative propaganda that has little to do with science.a waste of time unless you want a breezy summary of anti-science agitprop, that's bereft of depth or research, written by someone with no relevant credentials.if you want to read propaganda, you're better off going directly to behe and johnson--their arguments are hollow but at least they don't resort to cheap shots and beating the snot out of straw men.short version: a complete waste of paper even if you're interested in anti-science agitprop. glad i read it in barnes and noble and didnt pay money for this. it's too coarse for toilet paper."
2,Just to be fair I gave this two stars.,"If I ever make it through the second half I might take one back. I thought of ""Bill Maher"" when I read the title. I thought this would be a funny read not a religious one. Luckily you are not buying in haste and have the foresight to read reviews.If you are a Christian and hate Evolution, or any other part of science that contradicts your religion, this will be an enjoyable read. I just could not find this person nor some of his sources credible. A lovely twisting of facts.Enjoy."
1,Pure Evil,"One thing that the Right simply does not understand is that reality does not change itself to conform to their doctrine. This is nowhere more apparent than in this book. Everything here is the antithesis of science. The personal attacks, the appeal to faith, the appeal to the moral danger of accepting scientific conclusions, the cherry picking of favorable results while ignoring and defaming anything that isn't in lock-step with your desires.This is not science. This is theocratic fascism and a smear against all science. In a world where scientific inquiry is replaced by dogma we have very little to hope for.I note that Regnery Press, the publisher of this terrible screed, was the Nazi-sympathizing mouthpiece for Lindbergh and Henry Ford ."
1,Laughable,"Although the author has a fine education from Oxford University, he has less than a child's grasp of science. Repeatedly, he uses lame opinion in place of facts to support his weak contentions. This is one of the most biased, least rational pieces of misinformation I've had the displeasure to pick up. It's truly worthy of zero stars."
4,Pretty good but not perfect,"I'd really rather give this book 3 1/2 stars but I'll give it a 4-star rating because of its main point: science has been politicized to the point that almost all recent proclomations are suspect. Bethell is not trained in the sciences and his does make a few mistakes. However, he is very effective in pointing out how many ""reputable"" scientists have prostituted themselves out for grant money or a political agenda. Bethell is quite accurate in describing the increasingly political nature (pardon the pun) of reknowned journals such as ""Nature"", ""Scientific American"", ""Science"", and most sadly ""National Geographic"".Don't miss the forest for the trees when you read this book. Whatever minor mistakes are in this tome, the main point about the subversion of the scientific method in favor of a political agenda is dead-on and represents the most serious threat to science."
1,Worthless,"Wow. This has got to be the worst book on ""science"" that I have ever read. Lucky for me, Borders has a liberal return policy."
1,Stupid people will believe this book represents reality,"Personally, I can't believe that such a biased crapfest gets so many five star reviews. I mean really, only people who are mired in religious dogma or who have a political stake in undermining public confidence in science can even take this book seriously. It is worse, though really only slightly than the other PIG book on history."
1,Worthless right-wing trash aimed at the scientifically ignorant,"Don't waste your money on this poorly reasoned tome. The author is pandering to the prejudices and ignorance of his conservative target audience, but anyone with an educational background in basic science and a modicum of intellectual honesty should be able to clearly see the ideology that is at play here. If you really want to learn about science, avoid this book and read something by Richard Feynman, Roger Penrose, Martin Gardner, Michael Ruse, Thomas Kuhn, Ian Hacking or Sir Karl Popper instead. You will be much better served!"
4,Don't kill the goose that lays the golden egg,"A point that comes across strongly is that if there is enough hysteria about something, politicians will thrown heaps of money to scientists to study it, and lots of scientists are happy to tell the politicians and the public whatever they want to hear so the money will keep flowing in.The most surprising chapter is the one about AIDS in Africa. Can it be true that this pandemic is really a huge case of misdiagnosis?Each chapter really needs a book to itself, but there is plenty of recommended reading."
1,This book is a nightmarish disgrace,"This book is almost completely useless, it is painfully obvious that Mr. Bethell lacks basic scientific knowledge or understanding and is hypocritical in the extreme."
1,politically AND scientifically incorrect guide to science,"first, i'd like to qualify that i did not read this book. after hearing the interview with tom bethel and chris mooney on the science friday podcast 6/16/06, i wouldn't touch the book with a ten foot stick. if anything, the book sounds like a study in demagogery and devil advocacy. mr bethel could not defend a single point opinioned in his book, from global warming to intelligent design. listening to his ramblings, i was embarrassed for the guy. if you are considering this book, save yourself some time and money and download science friday 6/16/06 podcast."
3,cute for halloween,"these outfits were adorable on my twin boys for halloween, we called them ""little stinkers"" but beware they fit very big! buy a size down!"
1,An Apollo Nightmare,I inherited an Apollo System when I bought my current home. It has been a maintenance nightmare and I am finally throwing in the towel in frustration and disappointment. I am currently on my 5th control board in 8 years and the third armature. In the same time - the Liftmaster system I installed at a 170 space RV Park has required one maintenance call. If you want another nightmare in your life - buy an Apollo!
1,A Busted Product,"Everyone has told me Apollo Gates are the best. For some reason, I have the worst gate in the world. It was installed in May of 2011 and I have already spent another $2K fixing/maintaining it. I have had an awful experience and would not recommend you buy anything this company makes. Not a quality product!"
4,as expected,"Most of these movies I saw in the 40's and 50's. I enjoy watching them now to reminisce that life(my) era.Comparing my reaction,feelings at that time with those of today was very interesting. Is amazing the wonders that one thought was life at that time,since one felt ike living in the times the movies took place.I take this opportunity for some comments of another movie: ""Me he de Comer esa Tuna"" sent by a Huong Tuquach ,2120 Atwood Ave, Berkeley( can't read well the state,but looks like :Il ?) 60163. I was not able to play this DVD in the players I used to play the others. It is a different DVD or format? I have to see the DVD in my computer ...which is not nice. Thank you.nachin02"
2,Could Be Better,"This CD has a number of great songs from Lavay Smith and Bill Elliot, as well as other up-and-coming swing bands. However, it could be a lot better than it is. The cover of One Hand In My Pocket made me sick... Alanis Morrisette just doesn't transfer to swing. The mixes of classic swing songs like Jump, Jive and Wail and Blue Skies just don't do the originals (or quality Brian Setzer remakes, in JJ&W's case) justice. This is a good CD to buy if you're looking to experience a variety of new bands, but don't buy it if you're simply looking for a decent version of the classics this CD boasts."
3,Ultra Swing Nouveau,I like the Royal Crown Revue but some of the others are not my cup of tea. Thanks for asking.
5,Deep Knowledge of Ruby,"This is a solid Ruby language manual. It has more breadth than the Pickaxe Book, covering more libraries and advanced topics. It also provides more detailed, accurate descriptions of language basics, like exactly how the ""case"" statement works. I'm still working my through it: it is deepening my knowledge of Ruby."
5,"Wow, what an incredible book and so many angles not usually covered!","I am thrilled by this book. So many books cover things like sockets without going into detail on important things like non-blocking I/O... which is what you usually need. There's enough detail and especially sensible code to make it an excellent reference even thougn it covers many topics.A real treasure, and very readable as well as insightful. I've still got a lot of material to cover, and I'm looking forward to every minute of it."
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE,"This book is a waste of money, pure and simple. All of the topics covered in the book are totally obvious and repetitive. Not to mention the book is extremely hard to follow and poorly written. He tries to write in a ""hip to the kids"" street slang, which is incredibly annoying. Basically, if you know how to bevel and emboss, you don't need this book. Buy a regular photoshop book and the principles in this book will already be obvious to you."
4,Good product for a soft hold.,"This product works well and is a lot softer than what I have previously used (Dirty Trix by Matrix). The smell is much, much more pleasant as well. If you're wanting to mold hair but not have it hard and crunchy, then this will serve you well."
5,Dapper,"Every morning I soak my hair with hot water, towel dry it, style it, then let it air dry. Once it's dried out I get a little bit of Fiber on the tip of my finger and rub it between my dry palms. After that I apply it on the surface of my hair. It lasts all day (and often all night); while maintaining a matte finish."
4,For dry look it can't be beat,"Fiber is great for the dry look, and I haven't found anything else that gives as much hold with as little shine. It is tough to get out sometimes, and it will flake if you put too much in then run your hands through your hair later. Not perfect, but I still haven't found anything that is."
2,Too Much Negative Information,"This book is written by two knowledgeable professionals, however, it is full of negative information regarding what can go wrong during your pregnancy and all the bad things that could affect your fetus. Granted, this is useful information for a small percentage of women who are pregnant, but I've pretty much stopped reading it (and will skim some parts only) because the material can really scare you and make you anxious. If you are a first-time Mom like myself, I'd choose a different, more positive book on pregnancy and enjoy the experience."
1,Terrible-Depressing book-don't buy it,"This book is terrible, depressing and fills your head with doubts and problems. There is hardly a positive note, the doctor is a hypochondriac at best and every week (save for 3 or 4) has some horrible disease that your baby could get. I am not exaggerating, it is that bad. I know there can be concerns and problems do happen, but for a weekly pregnancy book, you should consider something else to keep you positive and upbeat. Pregnancy can be hard enough."
2,Below expected,"This book could be 4 times shorter. The same information repeats over and over again, very irritating. The book contains some info you will never need in your life and lacks some that you really need to know. I found out much more useful and interesting information reading magazines than this book. After I made it through first 200 pages, I started reading every 3rd page and guess what, i didnt miss anything, it was everything I already read before. Definitely not a book to read for those who have a tendency to be paranoid about some things. This book will scare the hell out of you for no reason! The only thing I liked in this book (and that's why it earned my 2 stars) is pictures of developing baby with a note how long it is and how much it waits week by week. Lucky, I bought it used and paid only 5$ for it, that's about how much it is really worth."
3,Good but unnerving,"This book had a lot of information; however, topics such as miscarriage, different deformities or birth defects, and other pregnancy problems were in every chapter- I would have preferred them to all be in one section. As a first time mom, it was unnerving to constantly see what ""could go wrong"" every time I read another chapter. Also, there weren't really any pictures."
2,Good if you have an extremely complicated pregnancy.,"This book is filled with things that can go wrong throughout your preganacy and barely touches on general information on a healthy pregnancy. If you or your baby have lots of major issues, this book will provide useful explanations of those conditions. This book could definitely make for a very stressful, anxiety ridden pregnancy if taken too seriously! Seems the people who wrote this one really want you to be paranoid. I suggest getting several books and taking it all with one big grain of salt."
1,your pregnancy week by week,"As a midwife, I was very disappointed in this book, mainly because of the negative, fear-based undertones throughout the entire text. ""Week by week"" a woman is educated about every tiny, rare complication or problem that could occur for her and her baby. I believe in education, but this is ridiculous."
2,a bit patronizing...,"I found this book to be written for moms that don't want too much information about what's going on in their bodies. It is written from an old fashioned perspective where birth is something that happens TO you as oppossed to something you are an active part of, where the doctor tells you what's going on -- and it is a bit patronizing at times. I found Sheila Kitzinger's 'The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth' to be a much more realistic guide to what happens to your body during pregnancy AND how to prepare for the impending birth (although it's not in a simplified weekly format). The books by William and Martha Sears are also great and positive, as is 'Birthing From Within' by Pamela England, which focuses on your role during the pregnancy and birth."
2,Condescending tone,"One of my friends recommended this book to me. But she also wanted her doctor to ""knock her out"" as soon as possible and not wake her up till the baby was born. The impression this physician-author gave me was that he comes from that old school in which the mothers *were* knocked out and a pregnant woman didn't need to worry her pretty little head because the (male) doctor would take care of everything. Although it's fun to have a new section to read every week instead of only every month, I found the condescending tone so annoying that I stopped reading it with about twelve weeks to go. The actual information in this book can be a useful supplement to a more comprehensive book, but this is not a ""stand-alone"" pregnancy book."
1,"10% content, 90% fear driven material","For each week, you get two pages that talk about what the baby is doing and what it may look at, very interesting. The rest of the section is filled with ""What could be wrong with your baby!"" I mean unless you are high-risk and have multiple issues, most normal pregnancies need not worry about all these issues. The way they present it, it just frightening.So buy this book if you have multiple health issues, and you have a high risk baby, and you want to worry about some new ailment your baby might have every week, no matter how far-fetched it is. Sometimes ignorance is bliss, and not worrying about all these possibilities might be better than the doom and gloom this book has to offer for you and your baby."
5,Best book I've read so far and I've read over 20!,"I loved this book it had loads of valuable information and because as my pregnancy progresses it tells me what is going on with my baby. The What to Expect book goes month to month and only tells me what my baby is doing by the end of the month. That's not enough for me I'm very excited and a little paranoid, I need as much info as possible! There is so much more information in this book. It also answers more of my questions than any other book. It has a companion book by the same author- Your Pregnancy Questions & Answers. Get it - its fabulous"
1,a.k.a. 'The Evil Book',"More appropriate titles for this book:""All that could go wrong in your pregnancy, Week by Week""""Pregnant? Let's start to Worry!""""How to create more Fear & Anxiety in your pregnancy""I open this book to the appropriate week, read the breif weight and length of the baby, and close the book quickly. Even the pictures (few and crude as they may be) are often of babies in distress! The only good information are the baby's weight and length, which can easily be found online. There are far better pregnancy books that are more informative, less anxiety driven, and have color photos to boot! Please, do not consider this book if you are pregnant."
5,My favorite book!,"This is my favorite pregnancy book! I like knowing what's going on week to week, and especially like the pictures showing the size of the baby and the changes taking place. I don't always have the same symptoms as what is listed, but who does? I think it's a valuable resource book, and I highly recommend it!"
2,so-so,"Like a lot of the other readers I liked the way this was set up by weeks, but I've read better books with more information. The best weekly guide I've seen is a new book called Your Over 35 Week by Week Pregnancy Guide. I liked the way the doctor was human and the question and answer section. My sister lives in California and is a patient of Dr Shanahan, so she sent me the book even though I'm only 25. The question and answer format is my favorite part of What to Expect When your Expecting, too. That is a great book, but doesn't have the weekly chapters."
2,Strange,"The weekly format of this book is in theory a really fun way to mark the passage of time during your pregnancy. However, it includes too much really scarry information that you can't do anything about. For example one week it goes into how dangerous it is to the baby when knots form in the unbilical cord but gives absolutely no information on what to do to detect or treat the condition. All reading that section did was make me worry about yet another thing.Personally, I found 'What to Expect...' to be much more useful."
4,Good book,"I liked this book very much and looked forward each week to reading about that week - it became my Sunday night ritual (though I sometimes read ahead . . .) I would advise to ignore ""What to Expect"" which I found unbearably patronizing and rely on this book instead. Much of the information is the same but you will not encounter the sneers and jeers in What to Expect and incessant preaching about your diet in this book. This book had a moderate approach. To those who say that the book is disorganized, I say - take a look at the index in the back. You can look up anything in this book easily."
2,"Not organized, Not helpful","I only wanted to buy one book for my pregnancy information, and this was a real disappointment. First of all, the book has information regarding pregnancy scattered throughout the weeks, so you almost have to read the entire book to know what is happening at the week you are on. For example, heartburn may not be covered until week 28 but you start having heartburn during week 15. Secondly, everytime I wanted to look up a symptom or pregnancy concern, the topic was never included in the book! I got very irritated with the book when week 30 included an entire section on ""cord accidents"" which are stated to be very rare, though seemed to get alot of space. Not worth the money...."
2,"Good week-by-week format, disappointing information","My husband and I sit down every week to read from this book together, and frequently find contradictions. The book contradicts itself, and other books we have about pregnancy. We get frustrated trying to figure out what to believe, and have come to the conclusion that this book is not very reliable. But we like the weekly format, so we keep reading because its good bonding time.The book provides very little useful information about what is actually going on in your pregnancy each week. It says things like ""you may be getting bigger now"" chapter after chapter during the beginning weeks. Each chapter also has a secondary topic that often makes up most of the chapter. This topic may or may not related to that week's developments."
2,Not a good reference,"I'm glad I checked this book out from the library before I bought it. I will not be using this book as a reference guide during my pregnancy. I wanted to find a book that allowed me to easily be able to look up various prego topics and and found this book had no logical order at all. The book goes week by week and includes a tid bit of information on exercises, nutrition, procedures, health issues, etc in each week. The problem is if you want to try some of the exercises or look up some information on nutrition you have to remember what week the specific topic was discussed in. The book jumps all over the place, one paragraph you are reading about eating fish and then on the same page there is a paragraph about stds. I gave it two stars because I suppose there is useful information if you know where to find it,but I'd pass on this one."
2,Talk about negative!,"This book should be called ""You're Pregnancy Week by Week: all of the things that can go horribly wrong and kill you"" From the very first page, this book is full of scenarios that will terrify you. I'm getting my money back for this little gem. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it has nice illustrations."
2,Very random information,"I like this book shows actual size of the baby at certian stages, but there is a lot of random information put in the book. The info is kind of thrown in, not in any order. I know the updated version is different but this one is kind of confusing. I did not care for it too much."
4,Pregnancy Book,"I really enjoyed this book. Especially for a first time mom. I really appreciated that there was only a few pages per week, but they included a nice description and drawing of what the baby would look like. I would definitely recommend this book to any expecting mom."
2,Not great,"In my opinion, this book goes into lots of detail about all the many things that can go wrong in pregnancy and will probably never happen to you, rather than talking about the things you want to know about."
2,Your Pregnancy - Expect the Worst,"Wow... At first glance this book looked fantastic and if you JUST stick to the brief information on size, symptoms, etc at the beginning of each chapter, it's great! It is informative and nicely illustrated.If you read BEYOND that, be prepared to have a nauseating dose of morality shoved down your throat and to be introduced to EVERY obscure complication that could occur. After reading this, I was convinced that I was having a miscarriage every five minutes and convinced that my baby would have some horrible genetic defect.I'd heard about how awful What To Expect When You're Expecting is as far as creating paranoid pregnant women so I got this instead but it's been serving as a door jam since about week 15. Get the NEW version of What To Expect instead!"
4,pregnancy week by week,"Only complaint would be that the shipping took a little while, but overall I was very happy with the purchase."
3,Take it all with a grain of salt,"I definitely liked this better than What to Expect, but I can't believe how many full-on errors it contains. For example, it says that you won't be allowed to eat or drink at all during labor because some women become nauseated. My midwives have advised eating and drinking something every hour as long as it's palatable, and research has shown that eating and drinking in labor can shorten the process by 90 minutes! Yet, Week-by-Week doesn't even present it as something that only some doctors don't permit; it dogmatically insists that everyone prohibits it.I found that it was more helpful earlier on in my pregnancy when I wanted to see how big the baby was and so forth. I didn't think it was as scary as What to Expect, but definitely found myself only cursorily reading everything and then verifying elsewhere."
3,Nothing out of the ordinary,"This book is okay. it is pretty much the same as every other pregnancy guide out there. It gives you important information such as the importance of prenatal vitamins and how your uterus is measured in the third trimester, but it doesn't have any significant insights. If you already have the popular ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" you definitely don't need this book."
4,Informative book but leaves something to be desired,I used this book during both of my pregnancies and it it was very informative and enjoyable to read. I looked forward to reading it each week to find out what was going on with my sweet babies. And even though I thought this book was nice I always wanted to know more. So in addition to using this book I also got other pregnancy books and subscribed to pregnancy websites. All things together gave the information I needed and wanted. But this book is a definitely a good start!
5,awesome book,This is the best book for pregnancy. I had a different edition with my first two pregnancies. I like this one even more! It has little exercises for each week that I really like too. GREAT BOOK!
5,great,a great and simple way to keep up with your pregnancy on a weekly basis and keep you in touch with everything that is currently happening.
1,Useless and Confusing,"like my title says...useless and confusing. I borrowed this book from my local library before actually buying any books and I hated it. It was confusing. I got the 4th edition of ""What to Expect"" and loved it! Try it instead!"
1,This book is extremely scary!,"This book scared the hell out of me! I loved the week by week idea of showing mother and baby development, but each week was filled with a new horror. One week it was car accidents, the next some rare condition called molar pregnancy which may result in hysterectomy! The woman on the cover of the book looks quite serene, obviously, she has not read the contents. A far better book is the Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth by Sheila Kitzinger. ALthough not in a week-by-week format, the book is wonderfully informative and positive, and the pictures are beautiful!"
2,"Some good information, laced with all kinds of scary things","While this book has some good information, the format for each chapter seems to be:1. What your baby is doing.2. How your body is changing.3. What sort of scary thing can happen to you during pregnancy.If you have a good imagination, you can supply your own scary stories of what can go wrong...this book only fed my imagination, and provided very little peace. It was good for a basic reference, but you can get that anywhere -- and online, the information is free!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The information in this book you can easily access anywhere else, both on-line and in better written books. Some estimations of size of fetus, etc. are not accurate. Most importantly, the section on labor and delivery is right out of the 1960's. Frankly, the tone of this text is absolutely insulting. I think I can decide for myself whether I prefer to have an enema before delivery or have my pubic hair shaved, regardless of what a hospital's routine procedure may be. Dr. Glade's point of view is that the obstetrician and assisting nurses make the final decision on all matters, stating that ""there are two patients to consider"". Yes, and the one that is an adult is the one that will be making the decisions. Expectant and new mothers (and their partners) need to know they have a right be consulted on the delivery and care of their newborn."
1,Book Review,"I purchased this book at the beginning of June, and never received it. Sent an email to the seller and he said he would check into it. I never heard from them again. I filed a claim with Amazon about never receiving the book, and the next day I was issued a refund. I am very disappointed with the book sellers on Amazon who sell used books."
2,Way too negative!,I am expecting my first child and received several pregnancy books from friends. This book was by far the most negative and disconcerting of the books I received. Each week the authors detail the development of the fetus and changes you may be experiencing AND all of the conditions that could possibly go wrong - even cancer (see week 30)! As a pregnant woman I was anxious enough without this ancillary information about rare conditions. I recommend the Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy and What to Expect instead of this book.
2,Subpar and poorly organized,"This book was really pretty dry and doesn't seem to give the information I was looking for. It was also poorly organized so that you would be in week 6 and it would take about something and say (see Week 11), where I wanted all of the information for that week right there. Also there were a few seemingly editing errors, but I was reading on Kindle so perhaps it was just incompatible characters. If you haven't read any other book or any web site about prengancy, this might be helpful for you, but the free week-by-week emails you can get from BabyCenter, TheBump, etc. are just as, if not more, insightful, than this book."
5,MUST BUY FOR 1ST TIME MOTHERS.,"This is THE BEST book I bought when I first found out I was pregnant. Very imformative, but @ the same time not overwhelming. The week by week break down is perfect. I read right along week by week throughout my pregnancy and that seems to work out perfectly. A MUST BUY FOR FIRST TIME MOTHERS."
2,Pregnancy should be a happy time......,"This book attempts to ensure that you will spend you pregnancy paralyzed with fear about what COULD happen.I also found rather contradictory information, the book mentions that cramping is normal, and the result of the uterus growing to accommodate the baby, but then also says that cramping is a sign of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and other problems, and is major cause for concern. Which are we to believe?Aside from those issues, which were enough for me to seek pregnancy info elsewhere, the organization of this book is nice for watching the baby develop and grow."
1,NOT a positive book!,"Each week starts out explaining physiological changes in the baby, changes you may experience and then describes everything that could possibly go wrong! Who needs that kind-of worry? What a negative way to look at the miracle growing inside you. Pass this one up and find a supportive, celebratory book instead."
5,Other Considerations,"As background material for this book, the reader is referred to ""The Scientist in the Crib"" (Dr. Gopnik, et al; Perrenial, 2001). It offers a fresh and detailed evaluation of the language acquisition process by infants. At about 6 months of age, a critical change seems to occur. The specific pronunciation patterns of the language(s) heard begin to be retained in a very focused manner. Also see ""The Monday Tape"" (The Snow Water Corporation) at Akilo.com for more insight into this process. This audio tape, one of a series, provides multilingual speech patterns for infants. It appears that they should help an infant (birth to age 2) gain good pronunciation skills for many widely used languages."
2,Not Enough Developmental Information,"This book has the potential to be an excellent companion for every pregnant mother, but it falls short each week. The weekly chapters are 8-10 pages long, but only the first page or so contains information about how the baby is developing and how the mother is changing. The rest of the chapter usually deals with something rather obscure, like the military's leave policy for expectant mothers, or with some horrible complication most women won't, fortunately, experience. My husband and I read this book each week, but we now joke about what the disease of the week will be. Save yourself some money and sign up for the weekly updates from BabyCenter.com instead"
2,Didn't really like it,"I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong.I would not suggest this book to anyone."
5,Excellent Pregnancy information,"Im in the second trimester of my first pregnancy and this book has done nothing but given me excellent information. Sure there are sections in there about what cold go wrong. Wouldnt you rather know about these possible complications up front than to not know what could happen at all? Those of you who are complaining about all the ""negative information"" need to realize that pregnancy is indeed a beautiful blessing but not all pregnancies are smooth sailing with no complications. The Dr. who wrote this book is just listing POSSIBLE complications, most of which have a slim chance of happening to most healthy women. So give the Doc a break people!!!!"
5,Very supportive,"Unlike ""What to Expect..."", I found this book supportive without being overwhelming. The focus is on what is happening within you, with regular notes on prenatal testing, nutrition, exercise and your emotional needs. The week-by-week schedule makes reading light and fun, something to look forward to each week. I highlye recommend this book."
3,Things to Worry About each Week...,"I bought this book when pregnant with my second child so that I'd have something detailed to read each week about the pregnancy. The book does contain very detailed information each week: the approximate size of the baby, physical developments of the baby, physical changes in the mother, etc. But then almost every chapter goes into some very detailed explanation of something that can go wrong during the pregnancy or delivery. Usually I feel that ""knowledge is power"" is a great motto but this book was frightening and worrisome to me - feelings no pregnant woman needs to have amplified. I feel particularly sorry for the first time mother who chooses this as her primary resource; there are other good books that provide great detail without spending so much time emphasizing the things that might possibly go wrong."
1,Do not reccomend,"Overall this book is a good source of information but there were things written in the book that should not be in it's content. Things like warning against back sleeping because it could endanger your baby's health and well-being and that taking a hot bath would boil your baby. Such information is untrue and only instills fear in a woman who needs accurate information and support not scare tactics that are untrue.While yes, back lying puts pressure on the vena cava and decreases blood flow, you won't kill your baby by doing so accidently in the night and I find it proposterous that a doctor would include such folklore in his book as boiling a baby in utero by taking a hot bath at home.A far better pregnancy book to buy is The Pregnancy Book by Dr. William Sears. It provides accurate information and loving support, he is a father of six children and the most renowned pediatrician."
2,If you want to know everything that can go wrong.,"This is the first book I bought after I got pregnant because it was recommended to me. I must say that I was dissapointed with the book. It does tell you week by week what is going on with you and your growing baby but that is about half a page. Then that's followed by 4 or 5 pages of everything that can go wrong with your pregnancy. If women want to be informed about everything that can go wrong that should definitly get this book. I on the other hand don't want to know about everything that can go wrong, I want to know about everything that can go right so I can keep a positive mind through my pregnancy. All the information that I wanted in this book I get on the internet by going on the pregnancy web pages online. So if your'e one of these persons that are sure that all the bad things happen to you, don't read this book because it will fill your head with bad ideas."
3,"Big, boring book","I didn't like this pregnancy book because the information in it was spread out in weird ways. For instance, they don't tell you not to drink diet drinks containing aspertame until the eleventh week. As someone who found out she was pregnant early on (week four), I had to make a point of reading far ahead to find out what adjustments to make as far as diet is concerned. If I hadn't thought to look for this information, I would've kept on drinking two or three diet drinks a day! The book itself is very dryly written, and is not at all a fun or interesting way to find out about your pregnancy. There have got to be better books out there."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it","I could not have gotten through pregnancy without this book. I really enjoyed knowing what was going on with the baby, and what could possibly go wrong. There is nothing worse than when something is happening and you have no idea what is going on. I have passed my book on to many of my friends and have purchased it as gifts for family and friends."
1,scary stuff,"I agree with some of the other reviewers. This book is scary. I've read a lot of the other pregnancy books out there (What to Expect, Girlfriend's Guide, Your Over 35 Week by Week guide) and yes, all of them discuss what can go wrong, but this book really focuses on the bad stuff, and doesn't pay much attention to the good stuff.My favorite pregnancy book is Your Over 35 Week by Week Pregnancy Guide, written by a ob who had her baby when she was over 35.I also like What to Eat When your Expecting for practical diet hints. although it is practically impossible to follow the guidelines completely."
4,"Better Than ""What to Expect When You're Expecting""","This is the 3rd book that I purchased when we were pleasantly surprised with the news of our first pregnancy. I liked that it was easy to read and that it's broken down by week. I wouldn't say that it's the BEST baby book that I've found - I have yet to find one that I would call the BEST. Unlike other readers, I didn't find the author's tone ""condescending"" or aimed towards hospital births."
5,This is a must have!,"This book is a must for anyone who is pregnant!Unlike other books, it goes week by week, not month to month. When you are pregnant it is often the happiest, most exciting time in your life. There are so many changes to track and look forward too waiting month to month is not acceptable. The pictures of the baby and your changing body are great! They really depict what you can expect."
4,a good book for those who think month by month is too long,"During my first pregnancy this was the only reference book that I used. I loved the weekly format, all the others I looked at buying had monthly, which seemed like such a long time to wait. I now also own the Mayo Clinic book of pregnancy, so all medical info is completely covered between the two. There is a bit of a focus on negative possibilities, but for humor I read Baby Blues comic books :)"
3,The growth pictures were the best part,"I bought this book with my first pregnancy almost four years ago. I really liked the picture every week showing what the baby looked like and the estimates for around how big the baby was. I really hated how there would be a complication of pregnancy described in each week. There was even an illustration of placenta previa with blood leaking out. I finally stopped looking at this book because it was freaking me out. All of the complications need to be put in their own chapter, not spread out with the weekly chapters. Also, the edition I had was outdated. He recommended that the woman be shaved and have an enema for childbirth."
4,"good, solid book on pregnancy","i liked the format, going week by week. you can follow the book as u progress thru your pregnancy. it was concise and clear, with enough information for me to understand what was going on and to follow-up with my ob/gyn with those that i need clarification on."
2,"Enjoy the pictures,skip the rest","The pictures were helpful in understanding changes. Very little space devoted to physical changes, and if you're looking for reassurance, don't bother. More than half of ""Week-by-Week"" describes what could go wrong and warnings that are more applicable to pre-pregnancy. Now is not the time to worry about syphillis, HIV, etc. If you remove the negative, condescending portions, you'll have a thin pamphlet."
1,Maybe for the first child,"I feel that perhaps this overly simple book would be allright for your first pregnancy, it really wasnt very helpful, and I felt that he talked down to the reader. ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" is a much better book, with information you can use, answers to your questions, and of course, being treated like a woman with intelligence. If you need your hand held and are unsure of your skills as a mother, this might be good for you. Want REAL help, look elsewhere."
1,Not good for normal birth or having a relaxed pregnancy,"This book is full of horrible information for anyone who would like to have a relaxing, stress-free pregnancy or for anyone who would like to deliver naturally. I'm not even currently pregnant and I'm full of worry just reading it.I truly feel sorry for any expectant mother who is reading this as their only source oof information during pregnancy. Instead of reading this or the What to Expect series, read something enriching and encouraging by a midwife or childbirth educator or doula. Something by Penny Simkin or Ina May Gaskin would be much better, especially if you want a natural birth."
1,"""What Can Go Wrong in Your Pregnancy, Week by Week""","This book has very limited helpful information. Each week has some useful information specific to that week of pregnancy as well as pictures of your baby. Other than that, each week spends a majority of its pages discussing all of the possible horrific things that could go wrong at that point in your pregnancy (most of them quite rare). I personally do not read 80% of the book anymore, because all it does is frighten me.If you are a worrier, don't buy this book. If you're not, you might become one after reading it!!!"
1,Shockingly idiotic,"I read this after ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" thinking it would give me a specific understanding of the progress of the pregnancy. But the title is just a marketing gimmick; assignment of advice to specific weeks is arbitrary, and the advice itself is oversimplified, patronizing, and idiotic: don't do crack while pregnant, and have your husband buy you a present... seriously?!?"
2,As someone said - too many complication discussed,"This book was a waste. First of all, they delay important information till the end of the book (weeks after 30 talk about nutrition). Then (and this is bad) they would say that your baby's eyes are developing this week and here are things that could go wrong.How bad is that?!?!?!?This book is useless! Buy Mayo clinic instead - there if you want to look up complications you can search them at the end of the book, plus it contains much more information - precise to point and usefull."
2,"Beats a Stephen King book, if you are pregnant","This book is informative, but is a litany of all things that can go wrong! After reading through this book, I was convinced that no Mom or Child can possibly survive and baby(ies) can be born without defects.Look around you and you'd see a world teeming with fairly healthy individuals, so mother nature has more control on things than you give her credit for in this book.Spine tingling!!"
2,Not that great,"I was disappointed in this book. I did not like the scare tactics, nor did the book offer any details about the symptoms or what you can do to make them better. I only read the part that talks about the babies development and skip the rest, because, I don't need anything more to worry about. I think a good prenatal book should offer answers to common questions, but didn't find any of that in the book and still find myself surfing the internet to get my questions answered. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Dont' buy this book if you're in your first pregnancy!,"I bought this book because it was the thickest book in the store's pregnancy section, and I am an information junkie. This is my first pregnancy, so the week by week analysis was very appealing to me. While this book is helpful in the drawings of the fetus week by week, and nutrition information, I am now scared out of my wits! I lay awake at night fretting about everything that can go wrong. As others have posted, this book focuses on all the bad things that can happen, with very little information for a normal, healthy pregnancy. The information that is in there is poorly organized, and it as it turns out, the book is so thick because it repeats itself frequently. I am already on the lookout for a new book because I am tired, and I need some sleep. Plus my husband is tired of me getting up at one in the morning to google whatever new health scare I have after reading the next chapter."
3,"Good, not great","This book was fun to read in the beginning when the baby is developing the most. Eventually I stopped reading it as much because each week talked about such random things. The ""Week by Week"" idea didn't make as much sense because a lot of what they talked about for a given week wasn't really specific to that week. It was just random information."
2,worry your way through pregnancy,"I bought this book because it was written by a doctor and was recommended to me but I am very unhappy with this purchase. The vast majority of the content of the book is negative in nature. From STDs, to ectopic pregnancies and on to every birth defect imaginable, this book spends most of it's space on the problems you could face. The first couple of paragraphs of each chapter discuss the growing baby and then it launches in to new problems for each week and not even in a helpful, precautionary way. Stay away from this book! Not good for nervous, hormone-filled pregnant women!!!"
3,Week by week isn't the way it goes!,"This book tidies up a scheduled read, but week by week isn't the way a pregnancy goes. There is much overlap among weeks and gaps in the so-so weeks that make this formula only a catchy title.I don't agree with those that say it says what can go wrong week by week. I think any information is better than no information, and you can't discuss pregnancy thoroughly without mentioning the bad stuff. Dr. DiLeo's ""The Anxious Parent's Guide to Pregnancy"" discusses everything too, but gave me a perspective on what the chances were of bad things happening, which made for a much more reassuring guide. (That book also goes trimester by trimester, which is a more applicable separation of pregnancy.)"
2,Unnecessary Scary Information,"It was fun to read week to week about changes and developments in the baby & mother. However, every week had a negative disease, problem, etc that could occur written alongside the development of the pregnancy. I think it's important to be aware of bad things that can happen, but to read about them constantly is very scary for an expectant mother. I would say skip this book if you don't want to be scared about the well being of your baby."
2,"Fun, but contains misinformation","This is a fun book for a first time mom insofar as it provides information about how big baby is and how he is developing. But do not rely on this book for accurate medical information regarding pregnancy, labor, or birth. There are several instances of factually incorrect information, for example, stating that routine episotomy is beneficial. Every other book I have read (at least a dozen others) have provided the exact opposite information. The book is good, and I have enjoyed reading it, but I am glad I have other sources of accurate information (that actually site to studies rather than just making upsupported statements)."
2,There are flat out lies in this book,"If this 5th edition says the same things the 4th edition did, there are lies in this book, plain and simple. It's a good thing I called my doctor right away when I had bleeding at 5 weeks, because according to this book there was nothing they were going to be able to do for me and my baby was going to die. As quoted from the week 8 chapter: ""No procedures or medication can keep a woman from miscarrying."" I was given progesterone 3xs a day for my entire first trimester and my 16 week in-utero baby wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for that, and he's doing just fine now. This book left me seething - if I had followed their information, I would have stayed home and let nature take it's course and be mourning what could have been instead of being excited about this new life. The other information in this book is good, but you can get that elsewhere without the added fear interlaced. First-time moms, do yourself a favor and buy any other book!"
2,"Loaded with too much ""worse case scenario"" information.","I love to read, so when I recently learned I was pregnant, friends and family gave me a large stack of the latest pregnancy books. This book is by far my least favorite.Specifically, there is a LOT, and I mean an EXCESSIVE amount of information for high-risk pregnancies. I did not like that in nearly every portion of the book, mingled in with the typical ""what to expect this week"" was data and information about expectant moms who are HIV positive and/or drug and substance abusers. I realize that this information is valid and real and may be useful to SOME, but a chapter devoted to it would have made more sense. I found myself coming accross tons of information about drug use during pregnancy that I personally have no use for. For that reason, I stopped reading this book and sought out information elsewhere."
3,Pregnancy Lite,"I bought this book for my husband so he could have a quick reference on what's going on week by week. I liked the pictures of the developing baby, but the actual information was not detailed enough and, at times, overly simplistic. And, I couldn't figure out why the author included some things. For example, in Week 22 he discusses appendicitis. HUH???Overall, this isn't a bad book, and my husband liked the format and soundbites of information, so it served it's purpose. But, I wouldn't recommend you buy this as your only pregnancy book."
2,Great pictures but terrible text.,"This book torments my husband and I. We can't help but look at it every week because of the pictures of the developing fetus, but we inevitably start reading the text, which we find irritating due to its condescending oversimplistic tone. The content itself is not great either; each week there is an ailment or problem discussed which is either frightening or not applicable, such as cancer during pregnancy, which I believe is filed under week 30. Is that the week I'm likely to get cancer?I know you can find pictures of growing fetuses online. I would do that, and avoid buying this book."
1,Not a helpful resource for pregnancy,"I received Your Pregnancy Week by Week as a gift. I would not recommend it to anyone. As other reviewers here have pointed out, the authors highlight a different rare problem every week. More pages are spent detailing scary--but unlikely--scenarios than explaining normal changes one can expect in pregnancy. Pages spent on issues like West Nile Virus make me think the authors just wanted to make the book thicker. A better decision would have been to group all of the pregnancy complications into another section. Bottom line? Don't waste your time or money on this book."
4,One of the best pregnancy resources.,"I have an older edition of this book that was given to me by my aunt during my first pregnancy. I found it just as informative as What To Expect, but in a different way. I enjoyed ""seeing"" how my child was developing and changing weekly, instead of monthly. While I understand some others' opinions of the book providing ""too much"" information, I don't agree. I personally would rather know what to expect and how to deal with an issue before it arises. To each his own. For those who want an informative, detailed description of the fascinating development of your unborn child, this is the book to read!"
1,Only read if you want to worry of what could go wrong instead of learning about your baby's progression,"The earlier editions of this book are wonderful for learning about your baby's development during your pregnancy; however, in this book, the fifth edition, there is very little information about your baby. It is filled page to page with medical problems. As a pregnant mother of four healthy children, I am getting rid of this book because it worries me needlessly whenever I open it up. If you want to scare yourself then this is the book for you. If your doctor diagnoses you with a problem that you want more information on, then get a book that focuses on that problem. If you want to feel a closer bond to the blessing inside you, try an earlier edition and focus on what your new baby is experiencing instead of worrying about the few and far between infinite medical conditions that could be traumatizing for you and your family.Best Regards,Melissa"
5,D. Braun,this is THE BEST BOOK to read during pregnancy...I had all the What to Expect series but found this so much easier to read. The Dad tips are a plus and I just saw an revised edition that I picked up to give as a gift that also has different work out moves to do during pregnancy.
2,Can't say I like this book,"I purchased this book when I found out I was pregnant. Most of the weeks I skip half of what they wrote because its ""what could go wrong"" and I just don't want that on my mind...you have enough to worry about right? If my pregancy is normal and healthy (which it has been) then I don't want to read a book weekly about what could go wrong. I haven't really found a great pregnancy book that I like so I can't refer you to anything. I love all of the books by the Sears family and would assume that The Pregnancy Book would be a great bet. I will check that out for my next pregnancy."
4,Overall Good...,"This book was overall helpful. I won't invest more money into it, so we'll just pass it around my family. I really don't know if it is any better than ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"". I would like to note that some of the things in the book were obviously written by a man, as they are completely clueless to certain things."
3,love the growth pics,"We bought this book so we could get an idea of where our baby was in the growth process. Initially we found it very helpful, and it provided some nutrition and health information. But it also dwells on alarming conditions and rare pregnancy problems - often two or more pages at a time. While it is a good idea to mention some symptoms if you are concerned, if I was diagnosed with any rare problems I would be consulting my Doctor, not a book. My husband felt like it was a bit much as we really just wanted to see what the baby looked like and what stage of development she was at - without concerning ourselves about potential pregnancy complications.I confess that we have not looked at the book in a few weeks - I can get similar growth and development information from the website babycenter.com - emailed to me every week for free! Stil, this book does provide actual-size illustrations that are great in those first few months when growth and changes are rapid."
3,"Helpful early on, disappointing in late pregnancy","I found this book to be more informative and useful in the first half of my pregnancy, as each early chapter seemed to provide a great deal of interesting information about typical changes and normal symptoms, etc. Now that I'm in the last trimester (and have been faithfully reading each weekly chapter), I'm somewhat disappointed with the book. It seems that most of the illustrations of the baby from this point on show some type of problem (knot in cord, placental abruption, etc.) and most of each chapter is now dedicated to a potentially dangerous or fairly rare medical scenario (e.g. cancer during pregnancy) that might arise but certainly won't happen to every woman, and definitely not in a particular ""week."" Perhaps a format in which more detailed information about baby's development (which I'm most interested in) was included in each chapter and possible medical complications were included in an appendix might have been more helpful."
1,an anti-woman book,"Of the 20 books on pregnancy that I read during mine, this was the worst one. It's obvious intent is to scare women into unquestioning submission to their doctors rather than give them accurate and empowering information to make wise pregnancy and birth choices for themselves. Giving ample information on very rare and serious complications, Curtis ignores the very real dangers of the common interventions he is so fond of. For instance, the only mention of fetal monitors is that they will be used in labor, but he fails to mention that studies show no improvement in maternal or fetal morbididy and a 25% increase in c-sections when monitors are used! He gives scant attention to prepared childbirth, and his only definition of pain management is drugs. I was most disgusted with his discussion on episiotomy, a normally unnecessary and universally-loathed surgery. I wouldn't recommend this book to any 1st time mom. Better to choose a more realistic book, like one by Sears & Sears."
5,Better than any other...,"This is the best pregnancy book. It covers all the pertinent information in a non-condescending or scare-inducing way. The week by week is perfect for new ""mothers"" who need more to read than one month at a time. I've given it to all of my newly pregnant friends and every one says its their favorite. (Dump ""What to Expect"" and read this one!)"
1,This book has scared the baloney out of me,"YP is the first book I purchased on learning I was pregnant, and it scared the living daylights out of me. I was literally in tears, worrying about neural tube defects and folate defficiencies, because I couldn't eat anything, and didn't know what I should eat anyway. After some serious research, I learned that since 1998 the FDA has required flour manufacturers to include Folic acid in their enriched flour, so it was all needless worry anyway.The author in my opinion spends way too much time describing what could go wrong, and little time on avoiding these complications.This is my experience with Your Pregnancy - Week by Week. I'll be tossing my copy."
4,Contrasting opinion to other reviewers,"I disagree with other reviewers' conclusions that this book is particularly alarmist about pregnancy complications. I read several pregnancy books over the course of my pregnancy, and found that ALL of them share one characteristic - disproportionate coverage of what can go wrong during a pregnancy. This book shared this characteristic, but was not distinguished by it!My husband and I loved reading this book, because it established a wonderful ritual for us. Every Sunday night we would read the relevant chapter aloud together. This would update both of us on the baby's and my weekly developments, and established a regular time when we could talk about the information and celebrate our experience. We really recommend this book!"
2,"Good for some, but buy other books too.","I found this book to have a strong emphasis on diseases and the effects of drugs (both recreational and prescribed) on your baby. If you are looking for specific information on one or a few of these topics, this book gives detailed information. However, I found it lacking on the more general topics that a pregnant woman is concerned about, such as nutrition, daily life style, etc. The organization was also a bit frustrating; of course I enjoyed seeing an illustration of the baby week by week and reading about timely topics, but not every topic in the book needs to be separated into the weekly chapters. I wish they had started with a long introduction that included all of the general topics, then made the weekly chapters shorter.In other words, reading the chapters week by week is not a good idea; some topics that you may be interested in right away may be buried in the middle of the book.(ex. I don't see why ""caffeine"" needs to be in Week 13.)"
1,do not buy,"I am very disappointed in this book. The first thing it did is scare me, every week there are only 2 paragraphs that are worth reading and they are tiny, the rest of the descriptions is of all the diseases and complications and problems that a woman can have.It is also very poorly structured. There is no easy way to refer to anything you've read before. Therefore, a useless book."
2,What to worry about each week of your pregnancy!,"This book gives you something to worry about each week or your pregnancy. It spends more time on what could go wrong then the beauty of what is happening. I found it extremely frustrating and unsatisfying. I would not recommend this book to anyone and plan to recycle my copy. The negative info that fills each chapter should be at the back of the book for reference if you are interested or find yourself dealing with one of the many ailments that fills each ""week""."
3,There are better pregnancy guides out there!,"I have read a number of books about pregnancy and I found this one to be poorly organized, sadly lacking in certain types of information, and as other reviewers have pointed out, progressively alarmist as the book goes on. What to Expect When You're Expecting is a far better book, covering every topic imaginable, presented in an easily accessible format. I did like the way the book describes, in considerable detail, the continuing development of the fetus, but overall I did not appreciate the seemingly underlying assumption that problems and complications are always lurking around the corner. What to Expect When You're Expecting has a much more assuring tone."
3,Conservative and simplified,"I found the information in this book ""dummied"" down and overly-simplified. There really isn't a whole lot of information in it that I didn't already know.The information they give also is very conservative in its advice. I don't like that it cites risks and gives advice on topics that there is more than one opinion on, but without reference where the data is from or presenting the opposing viewpoints. Perhaps this is a drawback in a book written by an OB, as opposed to a lay person who might present information from both the obstetric and midwife/natural viewpoints.Overall, I am disappointed, but is nice to check the basic info. on you and your baby's progress each week. If you want ""light"" reading, this is the book for you."
1,Useless,"This book contained TOO MUCH information that I felt was intended to scare people. If you are looking for a week-by-week guide to pregnancy, join a website like BabyCenter and read their information. You'll save money and certainly irritation. Especially useless for people who interested in alternatives to the Americanized birthing mindset."
2,Wanna worry for nine months?,"Then buy this book. I understand that lots of things can go wrong in a pregnancy, but I really didn't feel like reading about them every week during my first pregnancy. For instance, under 'How Your Baby Is Growing And Developing"" in Week 33, all they talk about is placental abruption!There is good information here, also; but it's presented in such a voiceless, humorless way that I found it boring. I should be anything but bored with my pregnancy! I much preferred the way ""What to Expect"" lays out the scary stuff, with a chapter in the back."
2,Scary Book,"This book is good for telling you where you are in your pregnancy week by week in terms of the baby's size and weight, as well as your size and what you can expect to feel. It also gives weekly exercises, which are nice, and drawing of what the baby looks like and the actual size.On the down side, most of the book talks about every possible thing that could go wrong with your pregnancy. I appreciate the information, but that really scares the crap out of me, especially with this being my first pregnancy. If you don't mind or want to know every little or big thing that could go wrong with your pregnancy, then this is the book for you. But if you are like most of us, this might just raise your blood pressure by adding a million more things to worry about. Good luck and congrats to all!"
1,I hated this book!!!! Don't waste the time or money.,"Not only are there much better books out there that are informative and inspiring, but aside from style issues, this book does a disservice because of it's haphazard presentation of information. The organization is terrible!! For example, they don't mention cord blood preservation till the 39th week, when it's way too late to order the kit. There are many such examples where they bring up a topic weeks and even months after a pregnant woman should know about that issue.I feel fortunate that I had access to other books but if this is the only book you're planning on reading during your pregnancy, you will find you are learning about things after the fact, almost useless. There are so many better books out there. Don't waste your time or money on this. I can't imagine how it's in its 6th edition???!"
1,Don't bother!!,"This book is just so wrong. It's negative and scary. It also contains wrong information which I see other reviewers have touched on so I won't go into them. It's so unfortunate that this seems to be a staple in every store and web store!I would really recommend you skip this book. YES you should know what to watch out for, but what IF something is wrong? You will know! This book just freaks you out early and for mostly no reason. If you want a Week by Week guide there is a pregnancy journal out there that provides some week by week. I would suggest searching the web too! You can find photos and information that doesn't induce panic and heartache.No matter whether you're mainstream or more natural-minded, I highly recommend The Natural Pregnancy Book: Herbs, Nutrition and Other Holistic Choices by Aviva Jill Romm as well as her postpartum book. They're meant for everyone, not just ""natural"" parents."
4,Decent Week by Week Guide,"This book is almost entirely week by week description, so the information is detailed. I especially liked the Dad Tips that are included with each week. There is also a tiny section on labor and lists of common events for the first several post partum weeks. I liked the simple writing style, but I often did not find the extra information for each week relevent to what I was going through at the time. I prefer You and Your Baby Pregnancy: your ultimate week by week by Dr. Laura Riley."
5,A+++++++++++++++++++,"This book covers everything there is to know about pregnancy, and the developing baby. I love it, I recommend it, no need to buy anything else, this book will answer almost everything (if not everything) you need to know, really AWESOME! (I also bought ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and I think this book, took it's place, ""What to Expect What?.....)."
3,One of the best pregnancy books out there,"I am having my second child, so I purchased the 5th edition book. I loved the 4th as it was very informative and had a detailed drawing of what the baby looked like each week. The 5th edition is a bit different. I still think it's very informative and the best book to have to guide you through these 9 months, but I wish the doctor would have put all the ""scary"" medical information in a ""special considerations"" chapter at the end of the book. It's a bit frustrating to have to read something negative every week. I also wish the doctor could explain a bit more about the development of the baby instead of just a few generalized sentences. Overall, it's alot more detailed than others out there."
2,I found this book to be condescending and of limited use,"The week by week concept is nice, however it does not lend itself to containing information you can refer to when you have questions. As another reviewer mentioned, additional information is haphazardly stuffed into the second part of the chapters for each week.What I found condescending were these little blurbs that the doctor apparently pulled from his/her office experience. He/she would list questions and answer them as though he/she were saving these women from themselves. The little picture of the doctor situated in these boxes almost has a look of smugness to it. I just found these items to be absolutely irritating."
3,A good read...AFTER the first trimester...,"This was the first pregnancy book that I purchased, and it scared me to death. It starts off with all the things I should have done before I got pregnant--it's a little late for that now, and makes me nervous that there are things I didn't do. Then, the book spends a lot of time covering miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies early on. I just found out I was pregnant, and truthfully, this book scared me to death.Having said that, I didn't throw it away, and want my husband to let me look at it again after first tri is over (he has hidden it in the meantime). I think it does have some good information, but for the newly pregnant for the first time, the beginning of the book scared me too much."
2,Book focuses on the negative.,"Although I enjoyed the description of the growing baby, the bulk of the book is spent describing things that can go wrong. Many of the problems highlighted occur in such a small percentage of pregnancies/births that I think the book only encourages paranoia."
3,I have read the book What to expect when expecting and what,"my girl friend is 3 months and she thinks the baby is moving witch she should not feel at this stage and she also tells me that at the age of 19 she was going through a change of life,And by reading this book she puts it in her head every little thing she reads out of this book she feels sick every minute of the day. So in my mind i think the book Ian,t that great signing off JAY .B"
3,scare tactics combined with some good content,"I was given this book by my insurance company and found it to be good in some points and incredibly biased in others. I enjoyed having the chapter broken up by week-- it was fun to have something read each week. I also enjoyed the sections about your baby's development and how big your baby is now. There was much relevant and interesting information. One thing I found troubling was the section each week which should be titled ""what can go wrong""--each chapter had a few paragraphs about complications that I found to produce fear and anxiety in me. What I found especially troubling was the section on labor and birth. I found it to be extremely one sided and imbalanaced. They say that homebirths are extremely dangerous (which isn't true), that you should never eat during labor, that you will probably want pain medication. There was little mention of any sort of natural childbirth."
2,"Negative and scary, not reassuring at all!",Being a high risk neonatal nurse I already know of all the things that can go wrong but this book really takes the cake! It discusses everything that can possibly go wrong and more! It never once eased my fears or made me feel relaxed and excited. It continually gave me one more thing to worry about and stress over until the next weeks chapter. The only reason I kept opening it each week was to see how big the baby was and read the few positive blips I could gleam out of each chapter. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. There are far betetr books out there that prepare and inform parents without scaring them.
3,Good but not great,"I really like the layout of the book. It goes week by week and lets you know the size of your baby, what you can expect, and an exercise. Overall it kind of seems like an outline or an abridged version of ""what to expect when you're expecting"""
4,Pregnancy books have been disappointing until...,"When I found out I was pregnant, I did the typical thing and bought What to Expect When You're Expecting. Well ,, I was actually very disappointed. The best odds diet was almost impossible to follow and I didn't think they described in depth enough what was going on with the baby. So I bought Your Pregnancy Week by Week and I love it. Pictures and actual sizes of the baby are great, disorders and issue are addressed that Expecting didn't even go into. I am just in love. I have given away 2 copies to pregnant friends and they are just as enamored. I will be reccommending, and using, this book from here on out."
4,a great tool to have on hand,i always look forward to reading the next week's installment of this book. it is very informative and gives good tips. it also has a weekly illustration of what your baby looks like which is an amazing thing to see. it's a great way to keep abreast of what's happening to both you and your baby on a week to week basis.
2,Not for the anxiety prone...,"Like others have said, this book is very alramist. Every week the author points out what could go wrong next. I had to skip over a lot of it or I would get freaked out. I liked the the first few months when the author compares your baby to an item so you can get an idea of how big it is. And the nutrition info is ok, but there are way better books. The Mayo Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth has write ups on every week, then a section all about possible complications that you can look at-if you want to. I also loved (in the Mayo book) how they had all the pg symptoms alphabetized so I could look up things as they happened to me (ie. round ligament pain, leg cramps). If someone lets you borrow it, check out some of it, but don't waste your money on it, I'm glad I didn't!!"
5,Best Pregancy Book Out There,"I loved this book!!! I read it from cover to cover! I was disapointed in other books that only covered what was happening during my pregnancy by month, or worse yet, by trimester. I found many of them were too general. Having a book that detailed information on how my baby was growing and how my body was changing weekly was wonderful. I cant recommend it enough for people who, like me, wanted to follow their pregnancys closer. I only wish I had found it right at the start because I was already about 4 months pregnant when I purchased it."
2,Frustrating method of organization,"While the week-by-week structure is nice in theory, it really doesn't work in the real world. I found I spent a lot of time flipping through the book, trying to find information on topics that didn't show up in the weeks in which I needed the information. The book has a lot of strengths (it's very comprehensive, for example), but I much preferred the thematic method of organization (e.g., all nutrition information in one chapter, all labor-related information in one chapter) that is used in The Unofficial Guide to Having A Baby by Dr. Sussman and Ann Douglas and The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas. If you absolutely want a book that is divided into chunks of time, buy What to Expect. The month-by-month format works better than the week-by-week format."
1,There is a reason this is in the bargain bin!!!,"When I was pregnant my insurance company actually sent me this book--I never would have spent anything for it. The male author of this book adopts a condescending tone that, as an intelligent woman looking for information, I resented. He medicalizes birth, and ignores the need for empowerment of women in an arena that belongs to us. Not a single mention of current trends in childbirth such as birth centers, water birth, midwives, doulas (or, heaven forbid a HOME BIRTH!!)...If you are looking to be empowered with knowledge for a rewarding pregnancy and childbirth experience, I recommend anything by Penny Simkin or Sheila Kitzinger. (the authors my midwive recommended to me)"
4,I like this book,"I do like this book, except the sections for each week are pretty short. Still, I do recommend this book. It is nice to refer to every week."
4,Bust A Move 2,"This game is hours of fun. There is no plot to the game, but who cares! There is hours of challenge action for people to play against each other. A great game for kids. No violence, nice cute animals. Highly reccommend"
3,application size shorter than required size,i purchased this belt off amazon and been over a month before i got around to changing it. the size is to short even though it said it fits my car. i wouldnt buy it unless you know what part number will actually fit your car.other than that the belt itself is actually a really good belt but you have to put the extra effort in finding a size that fits.
4,Koala Baby-Moonbeam Valance,The Koala Baby-Moonbeam Valance was everything I thought it would be and more. The colors are bright and cheerful and perfect for either gender. It really completes my nusery and I was very satisfied with the quick delivery. -Gina Ward
2,Valance has too much green!,"The 6 piece bedding is mostly blue with hints of yellow and green, but the valance strangely is more of the green color and it just didn't seem to ""match"" the bedding as well because that green just stood out more than I wanted. We couldn't return it because it came as part of the package."
4,koala baby moonbeam valance,It's a really nice little valance--a little pricy for what it is but it matches a carters crib set I already have. I couldn't find curtains or a valance anywhere to match --so I was happy to locate this.
3,"Good book, but, not as expected","Back ground information and display of characters is excellent. However, the character selection was a surprise and somewhat disappointing and the stroke order for the characters was a not emphasized. Felt that the calligraphy component fell short."
4,A Must Have for The Artist/ Student of Chinese,If you are interested in the history of the development of Chinese characters this book is for you. The evolution of the characters is valuable for the language student as well as the artist. Understanding the development of the chinese characters is a great help also to the student of Japanese. This is a wonderful book for the linguist as well as the artist.
2,Childish Scripts,"I am Chinese and I have practise the art. The scripts on the book look unbalanced, as if a child has written it. My advice to the author is:read the masters, ... Honestly, the modern ""standard"" (Kai Su) style is the hardest to master, harder even than the ""grass"" or ""walking"" (cursive) styles, because the balance between stability and fluidity is very subtle.The best way to start is from either ""Sun Su"" or ""Dae Su"", which are more stable and solid, where balance is easier to obtain, and whose strokes are also simpler."
3,Exquisite Chinese Characters,"Each and every Chinese character has a form of its own, representing a particular meaning and/or sound. This book is a good introduction to Chinese characters. An exquisite Chinese character, like thousand words, tells its own story and evolution. Through understanding these key characters, sometimes called radicals, one can discover the beauty of Chinese culture as well as civilization. (...)"
4,Difficult to install but worth it.,"It's a very cute wall border, but we had a hard time installing it. You have to put it VERY LOOSE in the water so it gets wet enough or you will have dry spots. I will recomend to intall it in pieces of 3' to 4'. We did it in very long pieces and have to use a brush to water it again (dry spots). Other issue was the top and bottom of it, they will not stay glued to the wall so we have to use multi-purpose glue and a thin brush to glue it back and it worked. Now that is in place, I have to admit that everything was worth it, the room is just the most beautifull I've ever seen."
3,hanging problems,"I love the design of the border, but I had problems with the top and bottom of it sticking. I had to apply wallpaper paste to the top and bottom after I hung it. It was kind of a pain to put up."
4,WENT UP FINE- LOOKS GREAT,"THE MOONBEANS BORDER LOOKS GREAT. IT COULD HAVE USED A LITTLE MORE GLUE ON THE BACKING, BUT SEEMS TO BE STICKING JUST FINE. I AM VERY PLEASE WITH THIS BORDER AND GLAD I PURCHASED IT. ALSO, GREAT PRICE FOR A DOUBLE ROLL."
1,NIGHTMARE - WASTE OF $$,The border smudges! It looks like it's been on for years and very worn. I went through 2 rolls and it did the same thing on both. I'm returning it to get my $$ back!
1,This border stinks,"We put this border up 2 months ago and the smell of the vinal is still so strong we may have to take it down before the baby comes. I am very disappointed, I already purchased all the matching products and wasted $50 on this border. It smells so stong we can not even sleep in our room with the babies room door open."
4,Pleased Overall,"My husband and I put up this border and it took quite some time to complete. The glue does drip down the walls, so it is definately necessary to have extra help. One person should not tackle this project alone; however, there is plenty of glue to apply it to the walls, so sticking is not a problem."
3,Looks great but refuses to stay on the wall!,"My husband and i bought this wallpaper because of course it matches the bedding set. We followed the directions and the wallpaper just does not want to stick to the wall. Its not the entire wallpaper sheet its just the top part, it keeps seperating itself from the wall then in one corner it refuses to stay at all the entire piece. The glue just drips off of the wallpaper leaving less to stick itself to the wall. Putting up this wallpaper made doing the nursery horrible which was really emotionally upsetting since setting up the nursery was suppose to be enjoyable. The aftermath is great the wallpaper is in the center of the room with the matching green paint on the bottom of the walls and white on the top. It looks great if it would just stay on the walls!"
1,I HATE THIS!!!,"I got a tamagotchi mini at the store.I was sooo exited when i opened the package!I have 4 regular tamagotchis and they are so much better!When i opened the package i pulled out the tab,my brothers were so siked when it started!When it hatched it does not tell you if it is a boy or girl!YOU CANT EVEN NAME IT!!!You cant play games and you can not connect with other tamas!!!All you do is clean up there poop,feed it,and give it medicine when it is sick.I HATE MINI TAMAS!!"
3,O.K.,I have 5 tamas right know JP and american and got this mini one when my friend got me it in her visit to Las Vegas. When I pulled the tag I was so excited after a while like 10 mins. it got really boring. Now it`s siting in one of my bags alone with some other Tamas that are scrached a lot. I don`t recomend you to get this. It`s well boring...
1,It is sooooo boring,My friends Kellie and Sarah got 1 and the next week it dosen't even exsist.Bad toy you can't do anything except put it to sleep and feed it.I hate it and so do my friends!
3,kinda boring...,i got a mini from store while ago. it was kinda boring only 2 growth stages reg tama hhas 5 no game no anything. cant even have tamababies. barely any charcters worse than original. well it not that bad 4 the price what do u expect from 6 bbucks. i recommend get 1 if u cant afford original it 15 bucks good 4 ppl with budget. but with new v3s coming out i suggest u get 1 of those instead its a wayybetter deal 15 bucks much more stuff more chars more functions 15 bucks kinda expensive but a lot better than this.i know i gonna get v3 my parents say yes. this not very educational teach u nothing.
2,Mini=Bad,"Ok this is my review. I have a friends who lost 5 black minis on a black table, [hehe] This is frankly like the first tamagotchis that came out, they were standererd, you feed it, play with it, it grows, it dies. End of my wonderful 12 tamagotchi's lives. I mean the mini thing is cute and i can see how some people might be exscited. But frankly, MINI""S ARE FOR COLLECTING NOT PLAYING. Anyway thats my veiw on them. If you want a cool collection to brag about to all your freinds, then great! if you want it for a gaming exsperiance, :/no good, unless your looking for that old tamagootchi feel.-Syaoran"
4,"So cute, but it breaks","It's really adorable, but the fluff ball popped off after about a week. However, with some super glue, you can reattach it."
5,This year's royal rumble was the BOMB.,This year's was cool with Stone Cold and the Undertaker and other superstars.The tag-match was cool and the world title match was great.
4,Best Royal Rumble!,"Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - ****, great match to start off show, good effort by all 4.Jericho vs. Benoit(Ladder Match) - *****, maybe the best ladder match of all time, everyone knew Jericho was gonna come out great since hes a high-flyer, but Benoit did great aswell, very surprised.Chyna vs. Ivory - ***, you could tell the end was really fake...HHH vs. Kurt Angle - ****, good match, lots happening outside of the ring aswell.Royal Rumble - ***** Best Royal Rumble match of all time, the hardcore part was probably which made it the best."
2,Dissapointing,"Well, i'm a big WWF fan and the Royal Rumble is my 3rd favorite PPV usually. But this year's was such a dissapointment.Dudleyz vs. E & C - 2 out of 5 stars. Very boring match. Not nearly as good as it could have been.Ladder Match for IC Title: Benoit vs. Jericho. 5 out of 5 stars. Excellent. The very best match of the night and very well of the year. Also remember, this was the last fued these two would have before Benoit turning BabyFace.Women's Title Match: Chyna Vs. Ivory. 0 out of 5 stars. The best part of this match was the fact that it was short.WWF Title Match: HHH vs. Angle. 2 out of 5 stars. Again, very disappointing.Royal Rumble: 3 of out 5 stars. Pretty obvious who was gonna win when it was down to Kane and Austin. Should have been Austin and Rock. But definitely a [cruddy] Royal Rumble.Folks, don't waste money on this tape. Get the best Royal Rumble ever which was Royal Rumble 2000. Now there's a great PPV!"
4,Very good PPV overall,"This was a great PPV, with an excellent effort by all, especially Benoit v. Jericho (IC Title Ladder Match). With the exception of Chyna v. Ivory, the card was spectacular, with no match being less than extremely good. Chyna v. Ivory has no value whatsoever, however, so I'd reccomend just fast-forwarding through the 4 minutes that takes. Anyway, thumbs way up for Royal Rumble 2001!"
3,mostly good,"I am a really big fan of the RR,and this was pretty good. The womens championship match was not good at all and the end was very disappionting and fake.the greatest match had to be the ladder match between Benoit and Jericho. They are both very good wrestlers and it was amazing how they can use a ladder. They killed each other. HHH vs. Kurt Angle was also pretty good in my view, But not nearly as good as Cactus Jack vs. HHHs street fight in RR 2000. the RR 2000 rumble match was better than this years.J.R. also said that Kane was in there for over an hour when I timed him at 55 min. If you are choosing between 2000 and 2001, choose 2000, it is truly better."
3,I can't really give an honest critique,This was purchased for a fan who reckons it's the bees knees. He's been a fan of WWF and the variations for a long time and in fact has been wrestling here and in Canada. So I bow to his knowledge of the genre. He reckons it's great
4,Very Good Royal Rumble This Year!!!,"Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoitthese 2 did it again but this time in a gimmick match that was almost impossible for these two wrestlers not only to win but to escape escape alive. it was the exciting ladder match that was easily a match of the year canitdate, they tons of creative and oldskool moves into this amazing match the only problem is that the endign was a little weird that brought the rating of the match down a bit but not too much. these two always have great matches but this was one of the best matches they had together. ****1/2 is the rating i am give the match i would of have given it a ****3/4 but like i said i didn't really like the ending of the ladder match."
5,*Rounds Of Applause*,"I have always been a fan of the ""independent film"" and Shades of Ray does NOT disappoint.The balance of dramatic and comedic elements was wonderful and the chemistry between the characters was fantastic. I found myself so pulled into the film that I wanted more when it was over.I highly recommend this for anyone!"
4,"Decent writing and natural acting, very good indeed","I wasn't expecting to like this one but was bored one afternoon saw it was free and what the he##. As Gomer would say ""SURPRISE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE"" this is really well done. Especially like the treatment of the 1st generation American characters, love the acting auditions, honest dialog and white comic relief. This is a better film than most of the big releases lately."
4,"Great message, typical Hollywood, but good","I like the fact that, given the chance to make his own choice, he chose someone similar to himself. Diversity doesn't mean you have to choose the opposite of yourself...just be true to yourself and don't make choices based on your family or friends needs/dreams/regrets or societies stereo-types for that matter. In Hollywood fashion, everyone was beautiful, so his choice was between a beautiful, white and successful woman over a beautiful, brown and socially conscious woman. Poor guy! LOL Either way, good message."
2,It's alright,"This pic is really not that good. I can't believe people are giving it 4 and 5 stars. It's ""good for a low budget indie"" but not that good. Kathy Baker gives the best performance but the whole production feels totally staged. There are a lot of well known actors working here but they deliver performances that are either flat or totally over the top. The roommate ""Sal"" is just annoying, not funny. Sarah Shahi is beautiful as always and delivers a decent natural performance. If you have some time and 1.99 it's worth a rental."
4,A film/director worth supporting...,"Just saw this film at a Lone Star Film Society screening in Fort Worth...I would definitely recommend this film to someone looking for a light romantic comedy. It was nice to see an indie film that could have been heavy with the full bodied emotions of a person's internal struggle with identity of self...intentionally stay light and airy.It is a film for everyone...the couple on their first date, girl's night (""Ray"" is so attractive it's hard to focus on the story at times), and anyone who every once in a while wants to avoid leaving an indie film with the feeling that there has to be some sort of melodramatic discussion at the local coffee shop afterwards about what each person's experience was in watching the film...its meaning...and its shortfalls/triumphs.Thank you Jaffar it was refreshing... -MJ"
4,a pleasant surprise,"Clicked on this not really expecting to enjoy it or even watch the whole thing but it suckered me in. Love the plot. Interesting the way such a fragile topic as inter-ethnic coupling is gently and genuinely portrayed. All in all, a good movie!"
5,the cowboy and indian critics,"Howdy partner and namaste. As a married couple, one a kentucky born football playing hick, the other a jersey born over achieving desi, we found the subject provoking, the humor refreshing, and the details rich like rava dosa and moonshine. Highly recommended!"
4,corky and funny,a lot of fun to watch! corky characters and smart witty writing. would definitely recommend watching this movie to my friends
3,Not bad!,"I really wanted a good puzzle game for my Playstation, seeing that you can no longer find Devil Dice (called XI in japan)for sale nowdays, I picked up this instead. Yes, the guy at the register laughed at me when I bought this, but I could care less, this game is kinda fun! The music is a bit generic, the sound is very loud and annoying, but the simplistic gameplay makes for a fun game. You have to arrange pieces that fall from the sky into platforms for Hello Kitty to climb in order for her to reach different things such as lipstick and fruit. Not a bad game at all, just a bit cutesy. Fans will instantly notice charaters such as Hello Kitty, Badtz-Maru, and Pandaba. .......................... You can always tell people that someone left it over at your house if your embarased to admit you own it."
1,the game that sucks,"this game is pathetic don't buy it what ever you do,the seller was great no problem their the game just sucks."
5,The Best of the Hello Kitty Games!!!,"This is the best kind of games for ANY ages! Yer NEVER too old for this kind of thing!! People say that this is kid's stuff; but the fact of the matter is ""WORK IS THE PLAY OF CHILDREN!!"" That's the problen with MOST people these days;they have forgotten what being a child is like. Or, like myself;their childhood was cut short by tragedy like Cancer at age 4 and theAir Force butting in!!"
3,"Well, uh...","This game is cute. Really it is. It's music is adorable too. For me it was a little difficult being that I was eating at the same time but heck. It's graphics are a little out dated, and the story line a little weak, but I guess it is okay."
3,Interesting but not overly informative,"Jancis Robinson takes the viewer on a interesting tour of current winemaking practices but the video lacks the thoroughness and specificity that I had expected from the prolific wine writer. Nonetheless, the video set was fairly informative and quite interesting...well worth your time for the price."
2,undersized item,Ordered for cradel....blanket so small it wouldn't cover the baby....??????? Was this made in china too?
4,A fine book about the merging of man and machine.,"A old french spacecraft is found after many years. It is discoverd that the ships pilot died in flight, but through some unknown process, his mind has merged with his ship. Another astronaut goes through an experiment to see if the process can be duplicated. He then goes on a mission in deep space"
4,Interesting & Entertaining,"I just got this book as a free selection today. I did enjoy this and the information the author gives not just on the seven women authors but in some cases, their spouses or other contacts and even inspirations who are in the writing business as well. The only thing is that I found parts of it hard to read. It seemed that the author told a very quick life story and then went back without warning to retell the events in detail. I tried to follow it and had to go back to read again certain passages and areas. The time lines did not stay consistent throughout which made it hard to follow. Otherwise I did enjoy the book and it has prompted me to look up some of the author's from yesteryear that I remember. It would be fun to read some of these novels- some for the first time and some for a second or third time."
1,"Might have value for someone, but I don't know who.","It's been awhile, and I admit I forgot it as soon as possible, but as I recall this book was supposed to be about women mystery-writers post ""golden age"". Instead it seemed to be just a lot of personal gossip about people the writer happened to know, but whom I never heard of. The exception was W. H. Auden, the poet, not a woman, who presumably wrote one or more mysteries, but the discussion didn't seem to go into that. I would have liked to have read one he wrote.,, oh well. For me, a waste of time and money."
1,Why use a fictional format?,"Although this book provides accurate historical information, it is presented in a manner that seems wholly out of keeping with its format. Why, if one wants to write an information book about the Holocaust does one write a purportedly fictional work, or a picture book. The children I have carried research out on, were unable to understand that the events described were real because the story format fooled them into thinking it was a work of fiction. Genres exist for a reson!!!"
3,A non-theoretical Darwin,"This is not a terribly interesting book; I bought it only because of my interest in his illustrious nephew whose powers of observation were far superior. What is interesting however is the book's representation of the extreme danger of travelin that era: of the five original travelers who began the journey, only Francis Darwin lived to tell the tale."
4,Great product,At first I was kinda wondering if it would be worth it. But after I recieved it I have no doubt in my mind that this ball is great. It does have a tiny dimple but you can barely even notice it unless you are ocd about scratches and stuff.
4,Hung Out wraps up the Mag Force 7 series,"Xris and Mag Force 7 have been hired by someone unknown for a mission. However, right when the mission is to start, Xris is arrestd.......for murdering Dalin Rowan. Everyone knows this charge is fake....but he gets sent to jail for another mission....to break the Hung leaders out of Jango. But Xris must do this by himself, while the rest of the group completes the mission. There is a rat in FISA, but who is it, and why do they want Xris dead?"
2,Okay - Book,"I read this book to my children last night and I found myself editing some of the words. It introduces animistic concepts I am not comfortable with my 3, 5, and 7 year old learning. Although the authors explain it a bit, I think it was not age appropriate. I am aware this maybe because of my personal convictions. The pictures are interesting and probably the my favorite part of the book. We loved the Abraham Lincoln book."
5,One Can Always Rely on Michael Bauer,"Michael Bauer is the most honest restaurant reviewer I have comeacross to date. Mr. Bauer has a cookbook out because he has integrityand only reports for the consumer and not the restaurateur, and thisis what has kept him in high standing. I have always found MichaelBauer's guidance reliable, and admire his ability to ""tell itlike it is""."
2,Disappointing,"Wish I would have seen the list of receipes before buying this book. Too many have items I would never be interested in like quail, squab and liver -- YUK!! Also, who has the time to grind their own meat for burgers? I am sending this one back ASAP."
4,Great features for the price!,"I bought this system for two reasons; price and features.I can switch between DVD, VCR and radio all on the front of the machine and I can change channels and chapters. Most systems just have play and stop on the front.The power is perfect for an apartment environment. Just enough to still sound great.The only ding I give this unit at this time is that it only seems to decode 5.1 channel audio in DVD mode. Surround sound channels from my cable box end up only in stereo, but the MATRIX setting works OK to send sound to all the speakers."
2,Awful product,"The overheating, shutdown thing just happened to me as well this week. From what I gather, it's a lost cause at this point.But even before that, there were problems . . .the amp wasn't especially strong, it wouldn't play some CD's, and forget about picture discs.I'm just glad mine lasted almost 3 years."
1,Craptastic,"Well, this unit was great until it died. Now, like a majority of people who have reviewed this, I am having the exact same problem. I turn it on, it's good for a few moments, (usually less than a minute), and then I hear some thumping from the Sub and deadsies. My guess is it's the power supply or maybe the cooling system, either way, there is a common theme among these units, whatever is defective in mine, is most likely defective in everyone elses."
2,Free is not cheap enough - Zero stars,"Originally, I thought this innexpensive and somewhat under-powered audio-video system did an almost adequate job for the price, but 2 months after buying it, our unit started to give us trouble when inserting slightly scratched DVDs. The DVD functions became unresponsive, seemingly stuck in a loop of ""reading"" and ""reading"" while a non-normal sound comes from the DVD drive. While the unit was stuck in the state, the DVD tray would not eject and the audio amplifier was silent, allowing no audio to come through the speakers. Often, we were forced to unplug the power cord to cycle the unit.NOW, just two days shy of its one year anniversary, the unit is unilaterally shutting off and making the same thumping noise mentioned by another reviewer. Also, while in this failure mode, the characters on the display panel are jumbled. Lame. Free would not be cheap enough. Avoid this unit at all costs."
5,Perfect fit,"I love this little hamper for my four year old. It's easy to store. And when it's full, he can pull it to the laundry room (he's a big boy, he likes to do this). Great purchase."
1,20 bucks for THIS?????,"I cannot believe this!!! I am a Sims 2 addict, and I am stunned with this new way to make a little money on EA's part! This Family Fun Stuff is a joke!! You get three clothing items for women, three for men, 9 for teens, and a bunch of useless costumes for the kids! And the ""MUST HAVE items"" it claims on the box are ridiculous. Yes, they are cute, yes, they could be useful at some point....BUT I dont think this was worth the $20 I had to put out for it, and you can download a bunch of custom content on most sites for FREE. The worst part is I can't get my money back. I can only exchange for the exact same thing. I am aware that this was not a full expansion, but give me a break! I will NEVER again buy one of these ""add-on's""."
2,No bang for your buck,"I love the Sims and was excited to read about this new fun pack, but when I loaded it I was very disappointed. It had some new wallpaper, flooring and decorating things but I was expecting much more for the 20.00 dollars I spent on it. Don't waste your money."
3,Lacking substance for the price,This stuff pack adds a few neat items but is not worth the price. I would only recommend getting this if you find it for about $5.
4,8 Out 10 Good Expansion Pack,Family Fun Stuff is a Good expansion pack with a great selections of extras. However it's not necessary unless you're a big Sims 2 fan and enjoy the games Customization features such as building and decoration your own home or business.Family Fun Stuff adds extra toys and custom features for your children and more.
2,Not what I expected,"That's what I get for not reading the reviews here first before ordering.I agree with the others that the amount of items don't seem right for the price.I would still buy it though, because the people who make the things for the online sites will probably be using some items from this pack for the mesh and without this pack, you won't be able to use the custom content from it. I look forward to what those artists can create using this pack!"
3,SIMS FAMILY FUN,IT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED TO BE AS FAR AS THE EXTRA CLOTHES AND FURNITURE. BUT I ONLY PAID $5 SO I GUESS IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY. WOULDN'T BE WORTH THE FULL PRICE THOUGH. AS FOR THE SHIPPER THE GOT IT TO ME FAST I ORDERED ON 1/31 AND RECEIVED IT 2/2. SO THEY SERVICE WAS GREAT. THE CONDITION WAS GREAT FOR USED.
3,its ok but dosn't have much of anything,its ok if you want to spend money on a package that dosnt really come with anything. Recommend not buying
5,good stuff,Ok I love the sims 2 ALOT! I am addicted to this game! So of corse I went out and bought this the day it came out! So I installed it! Then started my game! Well if ur like me u get a ton of downloads off the internet like furniture and houses and everything! Well it seems to wipe them from your collection of stuff! So that sucked! I had alot of stuff too! So that was the only down side to it! but the the stuff it gives u to make ur kids room is awesome! They are soo cute! I have twins a boy and a girl and they both have different rooms with both girlie or boyish stuff! So I recommend this to anyone but watch out if u download stuff off the sims2.com or any other site!!
3,Kids shouldn't write reviews,"Clueless kids shouldn't be allowed to use the internet. The red walls problem is associated with people using unsupported video cards. The problem isn't the game, but that they can't read a simple minimum requirements list.There are no viruses in the game."
1,Very Disappointed,"My ten year old daughter lost her copy of Sims 1 and a laptop during Katrina. When we finally got time to think about this fluff, we told her we would replace the software for her. With minimal (and as it turned out inadequate) parental involvement, she ordered Sims 2 Family Fun Stuff herself and her mother paid for it. After eagerly awaiting the arrival every day for a week, she was very disappointed to find out that this is not a stand alone program, but requires Sims 2. I just reviewed everything online and can see no requirements listed (other than Windows XP). In retrospect, we should have done more due diligence, but this requirement should be prominently displayed on this product. The lack of this warning borders on deception. Also, had we read the marginal reviews for this product, we would not have purchased it."
4,Know what you're getting,"If you know what you are getting when you buy FFS and want it, then you won't be disappointed. If you are expecting a bunch of new stuff and interactions, you will be.This is a stuff pack. It adds some new bedroom objects for kids, matching walls, decorative hangings. Clothes for kids to dress up with and tropical clothing for the whole family. If that is something you're interested in, you should get this. If you don't think it's worth it, then pass but save your complaints.That being said, I would not pay full price for this when it can often be found on sale or for a lower price."
3,Cute stuff but not amazing,"I got the family fun stuff recently hoping for more clothing choices and maybe some new actions for families to do together. Mostly it had things for little kids like castle themed beds and the like. I think I would still have bought it had I known what it really contained, but I think they should have called it Kid Stuff."
1,Disappointing and Waste of Money,"I always look forward to receiving my Sims 2 Expansion packs. I'm really disappointed with this one. Sims 2 Family Fun is just some new items, nothing spectacular and really, the Christmas bundle pack was cheaper and better. I think EA is really taking advantage of people on this one. I think $19.99 is alot for what you actually get in the game. I'll be sure to read ALL reviews before buying anymore expansion packs or bundle packs;("
2,Save your money - This Stuff Pack is SHAMEFUL!,"I bought this right after I bought Open for Business thinking that it would be a great compliment to my game. Boy was I ever wrong! There is a good reason why Maxis didn't give more previews of what would be in this stuff pack - it is a couple of low-poly, hideous objects, outfits, and recolors. I have spent more time on research papers than Maxis/EA did on this stuff pack. Would it kill them to make some quality hairstyles or even some new linens for the beds? If you want high quality downloads for your game, save your $20 and use it as a payment for a paysite or even go to a free site. The custom content offered on fan sites puts Maxis/EA to shame. Never again will I buy one of these stuff packs - it is basically stuff that is left out of expansion packs so that Maxis/EA can squeeze more money out of Sims 2 fans."
2,"Some nice new stuff, but WAY overpriced!","This is one purchase I wish I hadn't made, or at least I wish I'd waited for the price to plummet. I had read some of the reviews before buying this one, but decided to get it anyway since some of the download sites have stuff that are based on the meshes from this ""Fun Stuff"" pack. That is not looking like such good reasoning now.Pros:*Some of the new stuff is actually quite cool, especially some of the decorations and wall papers. Any quality new variety is welcome (hope that made sense).Cons:*No bug fixes that I can see.*$19 is way too much for the amount of new stuff provided. This should have been no more than $5 or included in the upcoming Pets expansion along with upcoming Glamour Life Fun Pack.In summary, A few nice new objects for an obscene price. Someone at EA should be thrown in jail for this robbery!"
1,Sucky waste of money,"More expensive than the Christmas pack with less stuff and just plain LAME!!!! There are no new actions. If I'm going to drop $20 I would at least like some new play, not just decorations."
2,Please no!,"As the other users said before, this game is just for money making. There are great FREE Stuff pages on the web with great stuff to download.I'm from Germany and this Stuff Package won't sell here very well, too. I mean Maxis promised weather and so on in the Trailers for Sims 2, didn't they? I mean they should include something interesting like Weather or Seasons or something like this into the Stuff Packages. That would make sense and that would be interesting, too.Again, I think that these Stuff Packages are just money making, and that's disappointing and unfair for us users, especially since we - mostly - bought Sims 1 and all the Expansion Packs before.Sorry Maxis - here's Game Over."
3,Gotta to have STUFF for my Sims,"What can one say about 'STUFF' for your SIMS? There's never enough stuff. Each stuff pack gives the game more things to decorate the Sims houses and surroundings. The one bad thing about it is not the game itself or stuff packs themselves, it is the amount of hard drive the game eats, I recommend that a few TB (Terrabyte drives) should hold the SIMS and all the goodies with no problem."
1,I don't think so,"Well I checked this out on several sources before thinking about buying it. I went to a friends home and saw that she had it so I took a hands on tour. This is the biggest waste of money I've seen so far by Maxis. I personally download alot of content off fansites that are 100% better than the offerings in this ""edition"". I've even dabbled in making my own objects,recolors, etc for the game. I think this should have been included with one of the other packs instead of a stand alone, or at least offered fro free at the official site. I've been playing sims since the very first pc game came out and this is a disappointment for us long time gamers."
1,No new item functions - just decorations.,"It was my assumption that the items in this expansion pack would have new functions. For instance, perhaps a new interactive toy for medieval fun, etc. I was disappointed - it was strictly for decorative purposes. You receive no new functionality and the new decorations are only a handful. If you don't mind paying the cost of a meal out for some new 'looks', then go ahead. Otherwise save your money."
3,"Not many items in this ""stuff"" pack. . .","First of all, this is a ""stuff"" pack, NOT an expansion pack. A ""stuff"" pack basically adds new items to the game and DOES NOT change gameplay at all. That being said, this pack doesn't have too much ""stuff."" It has 3 outfits for men, women, teens, and children. All the outfits are this floral-print, Hawaiian type clothing that isn't that great. The items mostly consist of things for kid's rooms. You can now give kid's rooms a theme like ""Under the Sea"" or ""Medieval Castle."" There are a few decorative items such as a globe or a ship in a bottle, but there aren't that many. These are mainly the only things this pack adds to the game. They aren't that bad, but this pack shouldn't cost as much as it does. If you really want the before mentioned items, pay no more than $10 for this game, but I recommend you pass up this ""stuff"" pack."
1,Try internet downloads first,"I would seriously reccomend trying free internet downloads first. I have NEVER had a problem with viruses or games crashing. Antivirus software installed and everything. Even with the pay fan sites, you pay about 5 bucks or less for an entire month to download much MUCH better items than Maxis makes. I love my sims game, but I gotta tell ya, if it weren't for the fan sites and their awesome downlaods, I would not be playing the sims."
3,Just a bit of info,"Okay, for all you Sim players out there considering buying this, this is just a side note. THIS IS NOT AN EXPANSION PACK. That's right. This is just a a disk filled with lots of objects and build stuff. That is why it is called a Stuff pack, not an expansion pack. This is only meant to give you more options for stuff to buy and decorate with, not give a whole new level of game play.Hope this helps."
1,MAXIS- You Can Do Better,"I am the ULTIMATE Sims fan and have all the expansion/add on packs for the game... I was so impressed and happy with the changes that Maxis made to the orginal game to create Sims 2- a Sim's fan paradise. I have always thought of Maxis as the company that put fans needs/wants ahead of profit... but this game clearly shows this is untrue. A handful of cute kiddie furniture that could have easily been put into ""Sims Open For Buisness"" expansion package- was turned into a meaningless ""Family Fun Stuff."" With only a handful of downloads this game is not worth owning or playing on it's own. For you can just as easily find the cutesy clothes and furniture on ANY Sim fanatic website and for FREE. All in all this game was a real disappointment not because of the content... but, because Sim fans we know Maxis can do better."
1,Don't get it,This was less great than I thought it would be. It started giving my computer problems so I would not recommed it
3,delightful tale of love found,"I found this to be a wonderful, easy read. Set over Thanksgiving and Christmas in the rough and hard New Mexico territory, it tells the tale of two people, lost in their private pasts and determined not to let go. With the help of a magical wizard, disguised as a gentle old man, each overcomes to find each other and true love. Grace, a lonely widow, trying to hold on to her husband's dream and her desire to provide something for her daughter from her father, no matter what the cost or sacrifice. Noah, a survivor of the war, a survivor of the horrible Andersonville prison, but a survivor only in the physical sense. He is an emotionally damaged man who needs the very people he shuns. A truly easy read with a predictable yet none the less, enjoyable ending. A must for those of us who can suspend disbelief for a few minutes and hope that good things like this can happen to people in real life."
5,Pretty White Platter,"Very pretty platter. The square shape really makes it stand out and the ~2"" edge being ""rumpled"" makes it even more interesting. I bought some other platters with smooth edges and I like them equally well. It's neither too heavy nor too delicate. There are so many possible uses for it...I'm using it right now under a square-bottomed plant pot that isn't totally waterproof."
3,Corelle,"Considering that the items ordered were Corelle, I did not examine the dinner plates, and did not notice that some of the plates were chipped."
4,I hate one liners,"Well, I just finished reading the book and am in an orgasmic after-glow. Yeah, Ecstasy Club was a trip. Hope Rushkoff writes some more novels."
4,Mellow Out!,"Geez, some of these reviews are a tad harsh! This book is actually quite good. It seems as though the ""Rave"" scene is finally coming into its' own as backdrop/inspiration for various mediums of expression. I'm not sure why this book would provoke such harsh criticism...It's well written, the plot moves forward with internal logic and the characters are filled out nicely. No, it's not ""Great Expectations"" or ""War and Peace"" but then again maybe that's a good thing! Sometimes I find it more helpful to my life to read something with a cool story and not an overwhelming message. I for one enjoyed this book and think that many others would as well."
1,Anguish!,"oh my lord, the anguish I endured, sitting through this drivel! I cant wait to tell the whole world about it, to share my pain! The beginning seemed promising for me, as I was eager to escape a world of office work, but things got awful. Everyone was so full of themselves and all this talk about creating time machines... I mean, I can appreciate diverse characters leading cutting-edge lives, but... three quarters of the way through I started skimming then just skipped to the end. They wanted to have rituals with this aborted baby and... somebody stop me!"
2,And...,"...and that emptiness and boredom and blankness are the only emotions which author transferred to me as his reader through the medium of his words and it feels like a disease which is called ""I am one of GenXers"". While being not exactly the effect the author probably aspired to achieve by his novel, it perfectly matches with the true state of lives and feelings of the people like the ones acting roles in his story. And by this, the work proves the eternal unity of the art and real life, both always creations of the creator..."
5,Ecstasyclub a view into each of us,"Simply the best book I have ever read! Rushkoff explains in his first novel, how it feels to be a ""youth"" How the people in the book actually made a cult in their pursuit to find some kind of ""nirvana"" and to beat down on cosmetology, a (rival) cult. The books succesfully mixes eachpersons own dilemmas, the club scene, The love/hate relationship that excists between very good friends, a couple of lovestories and action. Its just fascinating! After reading it, I felt like I had just been a part of something really big, that only me and the people that read the book knew about! And for you reading, Im not a drug addict, Im not a clubber, so Im not romanticising this book, for those reasons"
1,What a waste,"What a waste of time and effort. From the pointless descriptions of tacky sex, to the neverending unrealistically smart characters, this book clearly wants to be something else."
1,"Had promise, but failed miserably","Please DO NOT waste your time with this book. It is full of two dimensional characters who rarely act like a normal persons. Couple that with pure Sci Fi fantasy, and you basically have a book that tries to change the way the reader thinks about his world, but insteads ends up being an unbelievable book about a bunch of drug and sex-crazed wannbes. Maybe some of this stuff (though I doubt it) could happen in the future, but since the book clearly dates itself to have taken place in 1995, I'm not buying it, and I am VERY sorry that I bought this book. While enduring this book, I almost threw it out several times, but did not, hoping that soemthing redeeming might come toward the end. It never did.Stick with Jeff Noon for good writing of a similar nature that is more plausible."
2,mixed feelings,While the book was helpful in understanding the difference between some Linux distros it wasn't all that helpful since it is a bit dated compared to the latest versions of the distros it covers.
2,Very basic,"This book is easy to read but is also very basic concerning its information. If one is interested in technical assistance in order to solve problems with Linux, it probably isn't much help. It is more oriented towards an understanding of how the OS works."
2,One died after 3k miles.,"I replaced this along the strut mounts for my front 2005 mitsubishi lancer ES. after 3k miles the left side started to rattle when going on irregular road and started making weird noises when cornering. Had to replace the bearing for a OE one been fine since then. I dont know what happened but i dont recommended it. Also it was a bigger than the regular OE one although in the kyb catalog says it fits dunno if it has anything to do with it, right one is fine so far..."
1,Extremly loud.,Extremly loud. Pay no attention to the sones rating. I would estmate the rating at 6.0.I am online looking for a replacement.
3,fan good but grill broken,The fan works well and is a great deal except the grill was broken in shipment. I bought two and both of the grills were broken (in different spots). It was not very well packaged. I waited too long to report it so I couldn't get a replacement. I don't know where to find a replacement for just the grill.
3,I was expecting more...,"It's a good book, but I was expecting it to be longer. I was expecting more ways to ""live the resurrection;"" instead there were just a lot of long, almost meandering chapters. It was good stuff, but just... not what I expected. I was looking for more practical stuff about meals and Sabbath... which was there... but I was expecting more."
1,Most Disappointing,"This book was a big disappointment. It seems half the pages are just print outs of forms, budgets, etc. The information tucked between the pages of forms is the same stuff found in many more comprehensive and readable books. It seemed to be written by a computer, not a person. The index is weak as is the glossary. These folks made one movie and thought they could tell the rest of the world how it's done. The hubris is only exceeded by the vapidity. Sent mine back for a refund."
4,"No Kevin Smith interviews, Pleeeeeze.","The idea of an interview with Kevin Smith being a ""bonus"" is not appealing. Gimme REAL directors like Sydney Lumet or Jane Campion."
5,GREAT ASSORTMENT,"For those readers unfamiliar with Plastigage, it is a strand of plastic that deforms when compressed, by tightening the bolts (e.g. main bearing caps), between a bearing journal and the bearing shell proper. One compares the width of said deformed strand to a gauge mark on the product wrapper to read bearing clearance. Nifty idea and simple to use. This item includes ten packages, each containing a foot of Plastigage, of the following sizes:Five No. PG-1 (""Green""),Three No. PR-1 (""Red""), andTwo No. PB-1 (""Blue"").The numbers are the Perfect Circle numbers. Each color is for measuring a different clearance range: 1-3 thou, 2-6 thou, and 4-9 thousanths of an inch, respectively. With more of the product for the smaller clearances, which are more common, this assortment gives me enough to last a long time.I believe that this ""tool"" is the easiest way to measure bearing clearances."
3,Good For Puzzle Gamers,"This game is only enjoyable to those who like to spend long perionds of time working with puzzles. This game is a lot of fun, but only for a little while. It gets boring after you've beaten about 30 levels. The levels are also extremely hard and impossible to beat at times. If you like strategy and puzzles, get this. If you like graphics and a game that enever gets boring, stay as far away from this game as possible."
2,"Do you want gray hairs, or no hair","This game is the return of the classic lemmings game from the PC days. I bought this as soon as I saw it becasue on the SNES there was a 2 player option. That made things funny (Granted it's not the funnest multiplayer game) but it still had it's moment (Sabatoge). First off this game is 1 player, that cuts out replay value. THen we hit the puzzles which at first are simple but then we hit the big problem, further down. I swear to god this game is immpossible to beat without the use of Gameshark, it is so F****** frustrating that I gave up on it.IT's been two years no and I still don't touch the damn thing. It will remain as a memento to how I should search with caution before I buy."
1,JUNK,"I wouldn't even give this VCR ONE star, but that was the minimum I could select. We have not even had this VCR one year, and now my favorite tape is stuck in it, and it won't eject it and powers off. If I turn it on, it shows ""EJECT"" on the display, and then powers off. What a piece of JUNK!!!!!!!!!"
1,Junk Right Out Of The Box!,"Mine too was defective right out of the box. It wouldn't even power up! I returned it to BestBuy, and although my second one worked, it would sometimes eject the tape right after I put it in, (just like the review below mentioned), and the other time, it suddenly stopped in the middle of watching a movie, ejected the tape, and shut down... I again took it back to the store and demanded a refund. What a piece of garbage. I am gonna try a Panasonic and see how long that one lasts me. Stay away from this thing. There's obviously a design flaw with this particular model. Absolute junk."
1,0 Stars...Piece of JUNK!!!!,"First of all, I bought 2 of this model thru Amazon.com both units are JUNK!!!The only way you can get a record to playback properly (if you're Lucky) is to FF the tape to the half way mark of the tape then start your record.This is the only way you have good chance to watch without uncontrolable video roll along with audio pops and dropouts."
3,Good for the money.,"This Zenith VCR does everything it was supposed to do and I have no complaints. It plays commercially recorded tapes, it plays tapes recorded on other machines and on this machine. It's not state of the art and doesn't have all the bells and whistles...but it only costs 50 bucks for Pete's sake! I'm happy with it."
3,REPLACED SIMILAR ZENITH VCR'S,"As of this moment, I have a collection of hard to find new, or almost hard to find rebuilt VCR's. These Zeniths will replace similar Zenith units which joined others in VCR heaven. Delivery time was just fine."
1,Unfortunate,"I happen to be a fan of Instant Cash Flow so I had reasonably high expectations for this book. It is simply unfortunate. A poorly written rehash of the same ideas from Cash Flow, and then repeated over and over. Avoid this one and get Instant Cash Flow instead."
2,A big disappointment!,"As a fan of both true crime and forensic writing, I was very familiar with Henry Lee (although he lost quite a bit of luster for his actions during the OJ trial). This book contains no interesting revelations, and it is written (as a previous reviewer also noted) with a bizarre fictional character that detracts rather than adds to the stories.There are many forensic studies by other famous scientists which are much better than this lame effort."
1,A joke?,"I've been reading books on crime for many many years, including work by all the leading forensic pathologists. Never have I seen so sorry an excuse for a book. The whimsical character ""Sam"" is neither amusing nor helpful. And nowhere are the facts given in any comprehensive way. Nor were any facts put out that have not already been made available.I can't believe the publishers would go along with this kind of hoax on serious readers. A damn shame really. Anyone who wants my copy can send me a stamped envelope and welcome to it."
1,ditto on the 'big disappointment',I agree that the fictional character in the book (Sam Constant) distracts from any revelation or insight into criminology.
1,Not worth reading!,"I don't know why such a ""renowned and famous"" forensic scientist could write a book like this. A non-fiction book with a fictional character on it? Helloo! The authors gave too much emphasis on the O.J. case but not on the rest of the crimes of the past. Also, there's not much of a new information written in the book. If you have heard the case before, then you don't need to buy this book anymore."
3,A bit of a let down,"These cases have been done to death.The one case I'd like to have read more about is the one about Janet Myers, and Kerry Myers.Dr. Lee testified at the trial, and he had the jury spellbound.Pity Dr. Lee didn't write about lesser known crimes."
5,An excellent book. Great photos and ideas!,"This is an amazing book filled with all kinds of useful information. The projects and ideas are inexpensive and easy, yet look elegant and classy. A terrific resource for all apartment dwellers."
5,Recommended!,"This book has lots of wonderful ideas for making your pad unique and comfortable with very little money. There is a really great (yet short) section on one room living, and a DIY section in the back."
4,Post-College Apartment,"As a recent college grad attempting to create an ""adult"" apartment, I found this book full of great inspirations for a new look. The different projects and simple ideas were enough to get me started on some small scale redecorating. However, for a person on a limited budget, some of the furniture and decorating tools seemed a little too pricey. I would have appreciated a more thrifty point of view with both cheap and chic decorating tips. Simply put, I had to improvise on the book's ideas to fit my own budget."
2,If You Like Grandmom's House,I brought this book without noting when it was published. It's old and very tired. Who lives in apartments that look like this today? I'm 56 years old and it was really out of date even to me. Don't waste your money unless you like a NY 1970 look. I'm really disappointed.
4,Unusual and creative ideas for decorating an apartment,"I got a lot out of this book. I found the ideas easy and practical. Best of all, nothing cost a lot of money. I think this is the best book I have seen so far. My new apartment is decorated in a fashion that pleases me and didn't send my budget into shock."
2,Only an idea,I agree with the other two machinists/gunsmiths. The drawings were terrible and sometimes the tolerances didn't add up. This manual is good for a general idea on a design and nothing else. I completed mine and it shoots great but not before I redesigned about 30% of it. Don't listen to the one guy. It's obvious he's never cut a chip in his life.
2,Poor Drawings. Not for a Novice,"Speaking as someone trained in drafting, I agree with other reviwers that the drawings are pretty poor. Above all, they don't follow normal drafting practice and are confusing even to me. Given enough time, of course, someone familiar with drafting and machine work can figure it out. This is definitely not a book for a novice. In any case, for a general idea on how to build a 50 BMG, the book will at least get one headed in the right direction.I won't hammer the author's effort too much, since he makes it clear in the intro that he is up in years, almost blind, and has Parkinson's Disease."
3,So so,This book is pretty good. But don't expect to be able to complete the rifle in your hobby shop. It will take quite a lot of machining experience to complete as well as some engineering. All the deminsions are not there and the trigger sear combo won't work so you have to redesign that part. But the book will get you going in the right direction. Oh and order your Barrel from ima-USA.com. It worked for me.
1,yeah right,"Ok I purchased this i guess maybe with the wrong intent , the book shows you how to build a p.o.s 50 cal. rifle and yes it even has cutouts ,as if to use to cut out material. All in all if you dont own a browning 50 calibre rifle from world war 2 and you dont have a lathe .....dont buy the book ... waste of money ...or if you waant to buy one i 'll sell you mine on craigslist"
4,If you know how to use a lathe and Vert. Mill You can build a 50.,This is not the easiest read there is but if you can read a how to from a pencil drawing like most customer's ask you to make something from nothing You should be able to build this. Do not let this be your only guide but one of several I did not see the video that goes with this. the drawing and writing leave a lot to be desired For the price it is OK but who knows maybe I will have to write a book towards this area. If you need to have your hand held the whole way you need to do much more than this before taking on this problem.dray
4,Makes Ps2 Worth Getting,"I have 2 brothers and 1 sister, and only having 2 controller slots can make people waiting for their turn to get vicious!! Now that we can fit 4 people at once we can kick eachothers bums 3d-style :) 4 stars because ps2 should have 4 controller slots in the first place :)"
3,Acoustic Live in 1998--NOT Electric Sixties!,"Beware! This is not a rock recording from the 60s! Neither John Sebastian nor Zal Yanovsky is on it. This is a five-person group of two founding members: Joe Butler and Steve Boone, one almost original member (Jerry Yester who replaced Zal in 1967, but he did play piano on the original ""Do You Believe in Magic""), all in their 50s (""not that there's anything wrong with that""), and two new(er) members. With that warning in mind, this is the kind of music you might expect to hear on a ""Prairie Home Companion"" episode: excellent quality recording, nice chemistry among the members, and an appreciative audience. But it's not rock 'n roll (glaringly apparent on ""Summer in the City""), and I think it's downright deceitful that you don't know what you've got until you've opened it--and it's too late."
1,"Can You Say ""Rip-Off""?","I'd be as anxious as the next person to buy an album from a reunited Lovin' Spoonful, but this ain't it. Listen to the samples--that could be Joe Butler singing, but John Sebastian is nowhere to be heard. Zal Yanovsky on guitar is nowhere in sight either. Save your money and hope that after the Spoonful are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame later this year that Buddah will finally get around to doing justice to the back catalog of one of the best bands of the sixties! This album is strictly for those with way too much disposable income and a willingness to accept a pale imitation of a great original band. Run--don't walk--to the nearest exit!"
4,A great Buy,"This is a good buy if your television supports S-Video. What this cable does is separate the colors a lot better than your standard A/V cable device. This results in a much improved video quality as a result of more resolution. Your video games will appear more crisp and have more definition when compared to A/V picture quality. You might also see things that you might have never seen before due to the improved quality. I give it four stars though because of the price. This cable should be about $10 or $15 cheaper. If you are willing to pay this price, then you will like your results."
4,Sony Playstation 2 S-Video Cable,"The cable works fine. It is better than the composite cable the unit comes with. I was replacing another svideo I gave to my friend, but I am happy with the cable."
5,Superb Study of Dads,"John Snarey's book, How Fathers Care for the Next Generation, is a superb study of men in families. Snarey draws from a four-generation, four-decade study of men to show that the impact of good fathering lasts over a life time, and even over generations. With both statistics and stories, Snarey shows how various types of fathers' involvement in their children's lives is linked to their daughters' and sons' educational and occupational success. Equally remarkable, the book shows how fathers' involvement with their children forecasts their own work success and marital happiness years later at midlife."
5,Makes Perfect Sense,"It makes perfect sense that the Messiah would maintain a Kosher diet that would both benefit the body and satisfy the soul. So many ""devout Christians"" get so bent out of shape when challenged about their diet. The whole ""I'm under grace--not the law argument"" is used by most Christians to abandon the blessings of a Kosher diet in favor of the ""anything goes diet."" Eating pork & shellfish won't cause you to go to hell--in fact--if you continue to eat them, you just might get to meet Yeshua (a.k.a. Jesus) sooner than you thought. If G-d told Israel not to eat such things, do you think there just might be some benefit there---or does G-d just tell people not to do certain things as a ""Cosmic Killjoy."" The Torah is a blessing to all who trust in the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, & Jacob---even more so in todays world of processed junk food and refined carbohydrates. Maybe we should just use the fuel recommended by the manufacturer---ya think???"
1,Middle Eastern recipes from 2000 years ago are not hard to find,Do yourself a favour and leave the worship in the church and go out and buy your self a middle eastern cuisine cookbook. It will have better recipes and not make a mockery of JC. No one knows what Jesus ate and simple non-processed foods are easy to come by. I wouldn't buy this book because I didn't want to contribute to the A-hole trying to make a buck off a messiah.
3,Okay,"Having struggled with a weight problem for years now, I was overjoyed to see a book that would help me manage my weight the Lord's way. However, at times this book merely seemed to be cashing in on the What Would Jesus Do? phenomenon without actually caring about the reader. I must admit that I did lose 30 pounds while on this diet, but this may have been due to the fact that I was only allowed to eat fish and loaves of bread rather than to divine inspiration."
4,The way we should all eat,"This is a very interesting take on what Jesus might have eaten on a daily basis. The biblical references make it interesting, but I did not feel like much more research was done. I would suggest this book to anyone interested in knowing more about how to eat healthier."
3,Listen to your body!,"I won't buy this book, so my review is based only on a newpaper article that tells me enough to know that this diet is wrong for me. Having rigidly adhered to some very ""healthy"" diets and ended up endangering my health, I would caution readers that there is no one-size-fits-all diet out there. It took me years to discover that I require relatively high amounts of protein and fat, as explained in The Metabolic Typing Diet, by William Wolcott. Try copying Jesus' diet for a while and see how you feel. If the answer is fantastic, wonderful! But if not, don't make my mistake, be open to the idea that God may intend something different for you."
1,Life expectancy 2000 years ago was only 30 years ...,"Having read segments of Dr. Colbert's work, I can't help but wonder why he would chose such a topic as ""what would Jesus eat?"" It appears that he has shamelessly lached on to a popular concept without any regard for the irony of it all. Although I have no real data to back up my position (not unlike Dr. Colbert's approach), I believe it is fairly well documented that people in the time of Christ had relatively short life expectancies. This therefore begs the question: if life was short and times were hard, what difference does it make what people ate 2000 years ago?"
2,I Don't Think That Jesus Would Have Chosen Fat-Free Cream Cheese,"I was so excited to get this book, but I have to admit that I was dissapointed after reading it. It is obvious that Don Colbert is hanging on to ""Old School Nutrition"" that still pushes Low Fat Diets. I don't believe that Jesus would have chosen to eat Non Fat items. These kinds of foods are highly processed and are not natural. I think that Jesus would have eaten totally natural foods even if that meant eating natural full fat sour cream and cream cheese. I am not saying that this book isn't good because it is and it has alot of great wisdom but I think that the parts in the book that push Non fat foods are not correct."
1,Please don't buy this book,"Really, don't buy it. A healthy diet is a healthy diet no matter who eats it. Jesus may have eaten healty , but that does not mean we must eat exactly what He did. There are lots of healthy ways to eat. The Bible is as much a nutrition book as it is a flight manual. To use it as an outline for a diet is a blatent misuse of it's intent."
1,Who cares what Jesus ate?,"A more apt question would be; what do the Okinawans eat or what do the Hunza eat? Those are two healthy, long-lived civilizations. The Swiss rate right up there as well so why not ask what they eat?"
5,how to eat the way Jesus would like for us to eat,"alsolutely captivating, wonderfully written, very educational backed up with scripture. As christians, we need to be educated on what Jesus would have us to eat. This book lays the plan for eating health and biblical."
2,"Good Medical Advice, But No Theologian","I found this book to be useful from the point of view of good medical and nutritional advice, but was disappointed in the way Colbert frequently misunderstood or misused the scriptures. Bending scriptures and using them out of context is wrong, no matter what your good intentions are. I also was pretty startled to find that Colbert thinks that grace means we are now empowered to obey the law we were set free from. Did Paul misunderstand God when he wrote Romans and Galatians? There may be sound medical reasons to eat a kosher diet, but God made it abundantly clear that there are no spiritual obligations to do so."
2,"Superb quality, great picture.","Update: 4 years out, it just broke. Was expecting at least 6 years...This thing has been hanging over my fire place for maybe 3+ years now. Excellent value when I got it back then. Take note that this is a PLASMA TV so it's not all that new foo foo LED/LCD tech. Back when I got this thing, it was equivalent to LCD's and LED's weren't out yet. I wasn't looking for the highest quality picture and this thing delivered more than enough. In fact I would argue that 1080p is almost unnecessary when you're sitting more than 12 feet away.Anyways, its a great plasma, and it's been working well. It's a bit heavy, but its old tech, so, whatever. Highly recommended for an every day TV with or without HD signal. Good speakers too..."
1,Disappointed,The book is poorly written overall. It jumps from topic to topic with nothing covered in depth. Seems to be a collection of data gathered from other books or articles as the author doesn't seem to give anything but cursory commentary. Not worth the time to read.
1,There are better books on Pinehurst than this.,"I've been reading golf books for thirty years and this one has to be in the top five of the worst I've ever read. As I was reading this I noticed that I was reading the same paragraph, word for word, only in different chapters. If you want to read good books on Pinehurst stick with anything by Lee Pace."
5,Awesome read,"I'm not sure about those other reviews. I found the book to be quite entertaining. As an avid golfer, I appreciated Bob's insight into the cherished Pinehurst. I gift this book often."
3,Nice read about real people,"I like reading about real common people and this book covers that, but I don't understand why the man in the first book didn't just send a telegram to the lawyer to check out what was going on. The second book was a nice read also."
1,not worth 2 dollars,"i wish ther was a something wrong with this game like a scratch so i could return it for something!! if u r thinking of getting a golden nugget game, buy the n64 version. The playstation version isnt even worth 50 cents! dont buy this!!!!!"
4,A comic book not for kids,"Queen and Country by Greg Rucka is on my short list of Comics you should be reading right now but probably aren't. No super-powers or super-villains bent on world domination (except the ones CNN reports on), just a look at the fictional British secret espionage group the Minders. Protagonist Tara Chace is written like a real person whose job it is to go through extra-ordinary situations.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some may be slightly put off by the artwork. However, the art team is rotated with each story arc which gives each one its own feel."
4,Shades of Gray Written in Black & White,"Greg Rucka's excellent spy series follows the members of the Special Section of Britain's Ministry of Intelligence. This black and white series explores the moral ambiguities that flow in and around the dirty deeds done in the name of duty, patriotism, and having a job. The ""Minders"", or field agents, are not James Bond pretty, but are rather professionals in the field of espionage, often held fast by the peculiar rules of their trade. Eminently readable, it was one of those series that had me buying all of the trades as soon as I finished the previous. Also, look for the ""prequel"", Whiteout, also by Rucka!"
5,"THe name is Chase, Tara Chase","Greg Rucka is one of the authors, who can write believable Batman stories. Imagine how real he can get qithout the restrains of spandex-clad characters!This is a realistic spy thriller, full of real life and politicla situations. This is le Carre of comic books, really.Tara Chase is a British agent, sent to assasinate a rogue Russian general, who turned into an arms dealer.This book doesn't give you high-reaching conspiracies and years-old secrets, the conflict plays out much like it would in real life. But it doesn't make it less exciting.The art is very good. It seems cartoony at first, but it somehow manages to conway emotions very clearly, in fact, more clearly than realistic art, found in most action-adventure comics.Queen & Country started as a mini-series, but was turned into an ongoing comics. After reading this, you'll see why it's so.And you'll be glad, that there are other missions you can observe."
5,Beautiful,"I didn't think it was possible to write a detective novel with heart. I found myself crying at the end. It's not at all sentimental, just powerful. This is my first book by Markaris, now I can't wait to read more."
2,Disappointed,"Although the plot sounded good, I do not like this author's writing style. I can't really seem to get into it. I want to know ""who dunnit?"" but I don't know if I can finish the book. It seems like a slow read."
1,cheesy indeed,"Nonstop wiggly camera moves, fuzzy pictures and other creative modern TV effects that distracted from the story, which is presented in an overwrought Geraldo Rivera style. I gave up after about 15 minutes."
1,In 3 short words...,DOES NOT WORK! Dextromorphan polistirex is obviously NOT equivalent to Dextromorphan Hydrobromide..Total waste of money. And sleep when I counted on it.
1,waste of money,"plz people do not buy this...it did not work at all..kept on coughing all night...some said it has late onset of action,no it does not have any action even after 3broad taking it...totally a hyped product ...I immediately bought the routine Nyquil which is 100percent better...I took time to review this as no body should suffer like all of us.this product must be banned."
2,Ineffective,"I've had a lingering cough for over a week. Was looking for Vicks 44 Dry Hacking Cough and they were out; pharmacist said it's the same ingredient and it would be fine. I notice some difference, but not much, and I was up at 4 am again coughing like crazy and am exhausted this morning, just like before I took the syrup. I don't think it did its job at all."
2,It doesn't work.,"Unfortunatly it doesn't work at helping with my coughing. No wonder it tastes good! (It really does taste good, by the way) I suppose if the active ingredients work for some peoples cough then this would be the one for them to use based on the taste, but it doesn't work for me at all."
1,Ineffective & Overpowering,"I tried this on my son (almost 4 yr.). I gave him the recommended 1/2 tsp. before bed. He slept with me that night & still coughed ALL night. When I woke him up the next morning at 7am, he was VERY wide eyed and happy (he is usually completely grumpy). His pupils were dialated & he seriously looked high. It creeped me out so much that I didn't want to look at him. I remember now that I've tried it on my daughter (now 8 yr.) and had similar results. I will not give them this medicine again. It doesn't do a bit of good."
1,Are you insane?,"As of this date, this CAKE MIX is $59.95!!!!!! What on earth would possess anyone to sell (or even buy) this? It's a CAKE MIX!!!***edited 12/13/11 to add that they changed the price to $9.90. Buyer beware.***edited 12/22/11 to add that the price is now $19.99. If you're not careful, you can be ripped off."
1,Awkward,"This collection is a small, cramped collection, difficult to read. Much better to buy the full-size originals."
2,Way too small compared to original,"The edition in view (with three ""stamps"" on it)was already too small and now they are replacing it with an even smaller pocket version impossible to read with illustrations completely compromised. They sent us this new edition without warning and we are shipping it back. When we started collecting these 3-in-one books, the original sized Tintin books were not available to the American market. Now that they are they are well worth the extra cost of $8 for one adventure/book. The adventures and illustrations are amazing!"
5,Tintin Collection,I bought this item for my son. He is a big fan of Tintin. he bought most collection from London but was missing these few. He is extremely happy to have received his books that he has added to his collection that he treasures.
4,good game,The game seemed a little hard at first but once you understand it it becomes easier and a little hard to put down the control!
5,poetic & emotional,"This movie score is exceptional as it hits a perfect theme for each sequence of events. It has a poetic flow linked to the action on the field and the romantic story line away from it. I'm not a music expert by any means, but I know what sounds good and this music sounds great! For those of us who truly LOVE THE GAME, you will find yourself rooting for Billy Chapel to pitch his ""perfect game"" and to win his soulmate. The emotional crescendos are enough to make any tough athlete get choked up. A standing ovation, for sure."
1,THIS IS NOT THE SOUNDTRACK,"Don't confuse the ""Original Motion Picture Score"" with the ""Original Motion Picture SOUNDTRACK"". If you are interested in hearing the music and artists you heard in the movie. DON'T BUY IT!"
4,The cold hard facts,"A true classic of the genre, ""Scott..""chronicles the exploration of the world's last frontier: the great polar ice caps. The reader is emersed in the expedition as the pair of explorers plod endlessly in the tractless permafrost, unaware of the gaping crevaces hidden beneath the snow, but painfully aware of the howling winds that pelt their faces with stinging ice, and numbing cold. This very well written book is indeed a fitting tribute to those intrepid scientists who brave hostile regions to further man's knowledge of the globe."
3,Scott of the Antarctic,"Scott of the Antarctic belongs in any complete collection of books on Antarctic exploration. It has a wealth of good, basic information on Scott's Discovery and Terra Nova expeditions.But, having said that, the prospective reader must be warned that the book is a love letter to Scott, and has been utterly eclipsed by Roland Huntford's The Last Place on Earth, a far more scholarly and accurate account of the race to the South Pole."
4,PC User,Product works great. My only complaints are the start button is small and in the back of the unit and the software is not that great.
2,Even with a redesign they are flawed,"I have purchased a few of these drives and been generally disappointed. I have a 33% failure rate on them one year out. There are serious overheating issues, as is obvious on the redesigned version, which now includes an unattractive vent on one side. In spite of this, the drives still overheat and won't mount properly. Porsche Design has been a pillar of good design, but this is not worthy of bearing the name."
2,Not good for being on 24/7,"The heat is trapped inside the unit. With out the heat being trapped inside the unit, the failure rate is increased the longer it is on. If your using it just to back up files then turn it off its great. But again would not recommend for 24/7 use."
4,works well for me,"it's small, quiet, and does exactly what it says on the tin. only negative points are that the USB cable is rather short (but I changed it and solved the problem), and it tends to get rather fingerprinty, but a cloth can deal with that."
2,I liked it at first.,"It seemed like a great idea. So small, more then enough room to store the images I was taking for my first digital job on my first digital camera and super cheap. I'm not too tech smart and had a friend set it up to run with my MAC as it didn't recognize it at first. All was well until it turned over on itself. Now I know it was probably my fault. But just beware of 2 things if you are a newbie like me. The USB cord is very short and a little unstable in its connection. There is no room to wiggle if you are on a laptop. And second is they must be very sensitive right? if you loose every single thing on it just because it turns over! For the record it turned over I didn't drop it. Everything I had taken was lost."
2,Worked at first!,Got the drive and connected it to my Dell Laptop. Started transferring information right away and it was working great. Closed the laptop with everything attached. In the morning I opened the laptop and received an I/O error. Tried rebooting and now don't even see the drive. Anyone else encounter this? Should I just return it. It was in NTFAS format already.
3,Too big,"This is just a regular hard disk with an usb and an energy cord adaptor. The box doesn't give any protection for falls, I had an accident and it felt down to the floor, and the hard disk is now broken. I have one trancend and when it felt from my kid, and didn't broke, so I think is a better deal than the other, because is really portable, the lacie hard disk is just external."
2,"Very chic, but not sure about practicality","This drive looks great and is quite stylish, however, the manual/instructions for using the pre-installed software are terrible and while I seem to have successfully both of my small hard disks on to this drive, I have no idea how I can view them or how to restore them if I lost my files. When I click on the new drive, I can see that 170GB have been used up, but there is no sign of any files on the drive."
3,why no warranty?,I am concerned when a manufacturer offers no warranty. This product requires that you buy a warranty? When a manufacturer can't stand behind their product i'm a little concerned.
1,La Cie F.A. Porsche 320GB External Hard Drive,It was my understanding that this Hard Drive was a Fire wire connection. I found it was a USB connection.Please make your discriptions of products clearer. I have returned this unit and am waiting for a refund to be issued.
5,Works with Mac too.,"I guess it is naive, and maybe everyone already knows this, but just in case I thought I'd drop a line to say that it works fine to back up all my stuff even though it shows up as MS DOS (that scares me) and I have a laptop with OS X.It kind of freaks me out that it says MS DOS, and that might turn Mac people off, but I bought this unit because I heard good things from my Mac-only friends.I dumped 700 images, 300 papers and about 4000 mp3s onto this thing and I still have tons of room for more stuff."
1,WARNING!,"PLEASE READ!So i had this drive for a little over 3 years and was happy with it. It worked like a charm.UNTIL, last week when I bought a new computer. I decided to move ALL my data on to the external Lacie drive before I copy it on to my new system. The worst thing happened.. it DIED!!! After moving 100 gigs from my old system it started to make a faint clicking sound. I stomach sank. All my work, photos, emails was on this drive. I didnt hesitate to send it to DriveCrash data recovery.. paid $2500 for them to try to recover it. I got 10% of my data back. This is the worst thing that could have happened. They told me it was common with Lacie porsche drives because there is NO FAN!?! The internal drive is also a Maxtor drive.. the worst drive on the market.So my advice to current owners is to make sure you have a backup to this Lacie drive. My advice to buyers is DONT BUY THIS DRIVE! Please please please learn from my mistake."
5,Pleased,The Lucie external drive was installed and is now a complete part of my PC. It is used to store my pictures taken over the years and any data that I want to protect. I am perfectly satisfied. Tom Baird
4,Excellent product. Little design issues,"1. the USB cable is too short2. the power cord entrance initially seemed to be unstable, but the problem was that it was necessary to do a significant pressure to have it plugged properly.3. The led in the front seems to be a little bit displaced.4. Data Transfer is a little bit slow.5. The Backup program requires a lot of memory to run and might not be very functional, maybe I still need to explore it, but it won't update existing files i.e. for daily back ups. Instead it will create a new folder and repeat all files. I found it best to use it without the program, just as an additional drive mirroring my computer."
4,Works fast - easy setup - Good value,"Everything is very good. Fast, dependable. But the power plug into the drive is a little strange, and doesn't fit well. The power button in the back is hard to reach. Other than that is is sleek, has been dependable, and the metal case sucks the heat off the drive. I use it for video editing and no problems."
4,more like a hummer than a porsche,"I've had this for about a month now, and it's worked great (I'm still a little wary after my previous external drive crashed on me). It's a bit clunky, and I'm not crazy about having to plug it in separately, but it's so nice to have 300 GB of extra space to work with. It's a great value for the drive size and price."
2,Why Does Amazon UP the price of this so much??,I've always used Lacie products and find them reliable. My beef is with Amazon. Why do they have this listed as being regularly $197.93 when customers can EASILY check Lacie's website and see that the item is regularly $109.99 -- the supposed GREAT DEAL price through Amazon. Isn't this against the law? Why does Amazon continually do this? They lost my biz and my trust.
3,NOT 320 GIGA !!,Don't advertise for 320 GB if you're planning to sell 298GB harddisk. It works fine sofar (a month old right now)otherwise.
2,broke after 3 months of light-duty use.,"Seemed like an OK printer for a single user, until one day it displayed an e error message that even the techs at HP didn't know what it meant, so I went through a week of dragging the 70 pounds of it first to a local authorized dealer, who couldn't fix it, and then to UPS to mail it back for replacement. I can only hope it doens't happen again. Or, if it does that it is still under warranty."
4,Solid For Novice/Intermediate Users,"This text presents a thorough look at every facet of Crystal Report creation. It is very helpful for beginning and intermediate users. However, for more experienced users the authors fail to provide a useful summary of the built-in functions which are heavily used for manipulating the reports."
5,Good book for learning and reference.,"I found this book to be an outstanding tool for learning Crystal Report. It's an easy read and has many easy and relevant examples.Furthermore, since this is my first few weeks of using BOXI, I find myself referencing this book a lot. So far I have not been disappointed!"
4,Similar to Using Bo Crystla reports xi,This book is same as Using Business Objects Crystal reports XI.No CD available.The book presents topics with examples and not just an explanation of features like the (The Complete reference Crystal reports XI).One who is planning to buy (Using Business Objects Crystal reports XI) which is now very costly.Can manage with this book.
2,Not Very Useful,"I'm returning it. The index is missing many items mentioned in the book.It assumes you already know about many procedures. Example: I tried to find out about declaring and using global variables in Crystal Reports. Nothing. It tells you where to use them, but not how!If you already know a lot about Crystal Reports then this may be okay for you. That's the only reason I gave it two stars and not one star."
2,Michelin Paris Poche Plan (map),Disappointing map. It does show all of Paris but not in the detail I wanted. It sections out several blocks without including names of streets like better maps do. Wish I could return it.
2,Victorian england portrait of an age,"Disappointed in the book -I assumed -wrongly that it would contain actual pictures there are no illustrations even, it is all prose"
2,hamiton beach toaster,this toaster is not as great as it's advertised. When toasting waffles in the top slot it usually get stuck and fall into the oven area this is annoying.
1,Consider the source,"I'm on Amazon right now shopping for a new toaster oven, having made the mistake of buying a Hamilton Beach toaster oven just 2 years ago to replace a Black and Decker model we'd used daily for 15 years. As soon as we got the new one home we knew we'd made a mistake; there was no way to remove the glass door to clean it! We lived with a buildup of crumbs along the front of the unit.After just two years the Hamilton Beach oven failed; now it won't heat at all. We won't miss it. It was cheaply made, poorly designed, a lesson in ""you get what your pay for"". A true disposable."
3,Adequate - convenient,"This product is really ideal, looks a bit retro, but needs a tender touch. The top toaster mechanism frequently get stuck but can be easily fixed with a little patience. Other than, that it works great!"
4,Hamilton Beach combo toaster/oven,"I love this because it saves counter space. This is my second Hamilton Beach. Sometimes items get hung up in the toaster part and that is why the first one had to be replaced. Items hung up and the inside brackets broke. The toaster oven still worked but I needed the combo for counter space. All in all, I am pleased.I am very pleased with the shipper and I received the product in sufficient time."
3,Toaster oven review,"It's an excellent toaster, it looks good, it's small, compact , it looks modern, but the oven part is too small for most things...only flat items, small pizza, or flat food, not a muffin or small portion of leftovers, The oven is too low for food more than a few inches, so I was disappointed that I can't heat leftovers like I'm used to with a regular toaster oven. So I compromise for the space and the modern look and lose the oven use."
3,"Generally good, but one major problem","The problem I find with this toaster oven is that bread does not settle in the allotted slot unless I very carefully place it. I have had the unfortunate experience of, when the lever pops up, the toast sort of folds over and gets stuck in the machine because it wasn't resting in the slot perfectly. I don't know about you, but in the morning before I am properly caffeinated, my ability to use fine motor skills with my toast is out of my reach. Given the other good reviews, I'm wondering whether I have a poorly aligned version -- but this has been a considerably annoying flaw. (Hence, I am currently on Amazon looking for a new toaster!)"
1,Cute but doesn't work,"This design is great--sleek and takes up little counter space. But the bread tends to slide outside the prongs so the toast is always bent, the temperature regulation is awful, and I've never put anything in the oven part that doesn't burn. I decided to replace it when I realized I'd stopped using it entirely. Too bad."
1,Read the reviews -- Poor Design & Poor Quality,"The Toastmaster seemed like a good idea...I could deal with the design weaknesses with the benefits of flexibility and size, but then the top burner failed after about 3 months!Poor design & poor quality. What else is there?"
1,Worst Toaster Ever,"This toaster is awful. Toasting bread or a bagel on the 'toast' setting results in the bottom of the bread being burnt, and the top is raw. Not much can fit in the top, and truthfully, why would you want to be able to do this? This toaster looks nice, but it is awful. DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER."
1,Died after 4 months -- two strikes is too many,"Bought one in January because it looks nice and I liked the combination toaster/oven concept. The first one had something wrong with the switch that changes it over from toaster to oven--you had to push it REALLY hard to make it switch over. After a few days of straining my hand, I called Customer Service and the service person said no, it wasn't supposed to be like that, and to return it to the store. So I did, and the second one worked fine until this week, when the top heating element (the one at the back of the machine) stopped working. Like someone else said, it's a great concept but it needs some serious work."
2,waste of money,"I got this toaster for Christmas last year. The oven part lasted 4 months. Kept the unit for toasting, but it does a lousy job of that. I am now shopping for a new one, I can't stand using this one any longer."
5,Toaster and mini oven,I got this one for my granddaughter as I had one and liked it. She too loves it. Glad I got it for her and her family.
5,great little machine,"Very unique and useful concept for a toaster oven. My roommate had one so I got to test it out. Then when i recently moved apts, bought one for myself. looove it!"
4,Works great,"I recommend this toaster for families like mine where I like a toaster oven and my husband likes a pop up! It satisfies both in one appliance. It's attractive on the counter, and the pop up slot is roomy. I use homemade bread for toast and I find that the smaller slices don't always stay straight so it browns unevenly, but it's not bad. The oven is small but adequate for what I need. I don't like that there is no bottom tray to open and clean out crumbs. It's a little harder to clean than most toasters, but overall I'm very happy with it."
1,Very Disfuctional,"The lever that you pull down to begin toasting, doesn't stay down. It is impossible to toast unless you do this. You have to hold it down very hard to keep it down.Also, the rack on the inside is supposed to come out when you open the door, but it keeps slipping when ever the door of the oven is opened. You will end up burning your hand trying to get something out. Stay away from this product.Extremely bad quality!"
2,Save your money.......,"I have only one good thing to say about this product and that is....it's a nice compact size for a toaster oven combination. The drawback's are....the toaster part of it get's extremely hot and you have to watch it very closely. Also it doesn't toast like a conventional toaster because it has only one big heating element centered on each side, therefore, making your toast just have one toasted strip across the middle of the bread. And because it gets so hot, you really have to pull it out from under and away from cabinets or anything else on your counter and make sure it is setting on a heatproof surface....just to make toast! Personally, it's not worth the hassel or the worry. I'm going back to my regular toaster and conventional oven!"
1,"I'm returning this today - great concept, bad product","Bought this from Target after reading favorable reviews. What a mistake. The ""oven"" part is too small to reheat a ""real"" slice of pizza. I decided I could live with that. But the toaster is the reason I'm packing it up. I tried toasting English muffins. They fall off the metal thing that plunges down and get caught. The good news is that even when they got jammed in there, they didn't burn...because the heating element is too far away to toast anything. Disregard reviews that say you can't stop the toaster; you CAN, the same way you do with a standard toaster. But who would WANT to? This thing takes 3 plunges on ""dark"" to toast an English muffin out of the fridge. I'm gonna get a standard toaster and just reheat/melt things up in my oven. I'm done with toaster ovens. My old Black and Decker malfunctioned and almost burned my house down. B&D sent a new one but the top heating element died just after a year."
2,Too small for toast,The first thing we tried to do after purchasing this was toast two pieces of bread. We could not fit two slices side by side and part of the bread stuck out of the top. Returned.
1,Not what I expected...,"I was a long-time user of toaster ovens, especially because they're so good for those hot summer months when you want to bake something but don't want to heat up your kitchen. The only drawback to a toaster oven was not toasting bread as quickly as a pop-up toaster. I saw this one advertised, and begged my husband to get me one for Christmas last year. Well, it lasted about two months. I never could get a good toasting setting, and I was limited to two pieces of bread at a time. But the worst part was that the ""oven"" part of the appliance is too small. There was very little that I could cook in it, and I was used to cooking 9"" loaf pans of meat loaf, baked potatoes, 6-cup muffin tins, and other such things. None of them fit in the toaststation. I'm now the proud owner of a 6-slice toaster oven, having decided I'd rather have the space for more things in the oven, plus the capacity for more than two slices of bread at a time."
3,"its okay, some disappointment",the drawback I didnt expect was that you cannot use the toaster at the same time as the toaster oven. It does not clean up easily because crumbs fall into difficult grooves. Even tipping the toaster over and shaking doesnt get the job done. I do like the consolidation of the two units because it takes up very little space. Fits nicely in the cabinet when not in use. Received in a very timely fashion after purchase.
2,"Great idea, design needs work","Combining two appliances in one is a great idea, but this one doesn't perform either function very well. The toaster works fine if you have fairly firm bread, like sourdough or rye, but if you're toasting regular soft bread slices, beware! The parts inside the toaster that are intended to come together to hold the bread in place during toasting don't close tightly and only extend about halfway down the slice, so soft bread bends and folds, resulting in burned sections and causing the bent burned bread to catch in the toaster on the way up. The toaster oven basically bakes and broils at the same time. The upper and lower heating elements both come on and stay on, burning the top of anything you try to cook. I'm hoping mine breaks soon, so I can replace it with something else!"
5,Love this product!,"For a single person, this toaster oven is perfect. It doesn't take up much room on the counter and does everything I need it to. True, I don't do any real cooking, but for toast and warming up stuff, it's great. It performs just like the big, expensive units. It's just smaller."
4,It's OK,I wish I could have seen this product before I bought it. It's a little too narrow front-to-back to fit much in. It also seems to burn things easily. The toaster feature works great though.
1,don't buy this,"I liked the idea of a toaster and toaster oven all-in-one, but this is the worst toaster of all time. The toaster oven is small but worked okay before it broke after 18 months. Now I'm left with a ""toaster"" that puts a burned streak in the center of the bread while the edges remain untouched by heat. What a waste of money -- buyer beware."
1,What a disappointment!,"Like other reviewers, I, too, have found the toaster disappointing. Thhe main problem is that the toast jams and folds inside and, as other reviewers noted, needs to be pulled out--in pieces usually. The oven part tends to burn food quickly. So here I am, a year after buying this product, looking for a good, simple and reliable replacement. Shame!"
3,"Works as advertised, but....",The toaster is great. Works fast and just like a regular toaster. But...the oven is very small and some things tend to burn on top before they are cooked -- like frozen biscuits. I recommend turning the temp down at least 25 below what the recipe says.
2,Slice element broken within three months,This was very promising toaster and I loved how compact and retro looking it was but after three months the elements for heating the slice portion of the toaster stopped working which also means no heat from the top for items placed in the food belly. I still use it to warm toast but I have to physically flip it (as long as I remember to flip it) before the bottom elements burn it. I'd advise against this toaster.
2,"Good idea, bad implementation.","My Proctor Silex toaster oven was full of crumbs and it looked like it was about twelve years old because it was. I thought this looked nice and it had some good reviews from people who must work for Hamilton Beach. I bought one at Target thinking I would gain counter space, but now I have three countertop appliances instead of only two. It will probably end up in the Goodwill Industries collection box.The top toaster is worthless, it toasts unevenly. The oven does not broil, so I can't use it to make garlic bread as I am accustomed. It actually toasts well in the oven at 450? and quickly because of the small size- but you need to stand there and watch it because there is no toast timer for the oven."
1,Terrible for toasting english muffins,"I thought this seemed like a great idea - combo toaster oven and traditional toaster in one. But there is a design flaw that causes things like English Muffins to almost ALWAYS get mangled and stuck inside the toaster slot. Look at any other toaster and observe that when you depress the lever that inserts the toast, there's a mechanism that clamps down on either side of the bread to hold it in place while toasting. This unit doesn't have that feature. English muffins curl up inside the unit, and get stuck and/or fall down into the oven-tray area. Then you have to unplug it, and pry the muffin out with a fork. After 3 weeks, I am ready to throw this thing off the roof!"
4,Great Toaster Oven --If you don't need a timer,"Very Attractive Looking. Works great as a small oven. Works Fine as a toaster (Other reviews say it won't toast English Muffins Well - I haven't tried but for normal bread it works just fine, about as good as a normal toaster, and much better than most toaster ovens.Only thing that would make it better would be an auto timer to turn the oven on or off --If you can live without a timer, it's a great ovenWe bought it sight unseen for size and functionality, and were pleasantly surprised by how attractive it looks.."
1,"Mama ain't happy, daddy ain't happy","We bought the Toastation oven as a little gift to ourselves last Christmas. My wife was so excited because it is a great looking appliance for the kitchen counter.However, this thing simply has too many flaws. More often than not, the toast slips down and jams halfway into the oven section. When it does manage to stay in the toaster bin, it jams up. Then you have to unplug the toaster and use a butterknife to pry it out.We returned it with great disappointment."
1,Worse toaster oven I've ever owned,"First, this toaster is dangerous for kids especially, and adults. The surface of the cabinet gets very hot. It has a warning of course, but that still wouldn't stop a child or inattentive adult from touching the hot surface by accident. There are only two, somewhat large, round heating elements instead of a group of small elements on both sides of the unit, which causes toast to heat unevenly, sometimes leaving a dark bar across the bread. If your slices of bread or too wide, the bread gets pushed together and bent, causing even more uneven toasting. If it's not thick enough, the bread will bend in the middle. I finally resorted to just toasting bread in the oven instead of the toaster slot, but even then I find bread or frozen waffles are still heated unevenly."
2,No timer or shut-off on oven!,"I wish I'd noticed this before I bought it. I've already burned a few things because I got distracted for a few minutes, came back, and found my food in the oven burned up. So I'll buy a little timer which will help, but really, this oven would have been much, much more convenient with an oven timer that would shut-off when the food was done."
3,Good size; no timer,"Very compact, but a bit odd. The toaster opening is very wide (in the bread thickness dimension), so bread tends to curl up and become stuck inside. The oven toasts very quickly, but highly uneven between top and bottom. The biggest reason for my returning this was that there is no timer. Burned food is almost guaranteed...Keep trying, HB."
3,"Compact, but BURNS every time!","We bought this toaster oven a few weeks ago. It is compact and quality, but the toast burns every time we use it. Even if I have the dial set to the lowest toaster setting, I find myself needing to manually cancel the toasting because the bread is so dark. We have gone through a lot of burnt toast the past couple weeks!"
5,The COOLEST toaster that I have ever owned!!!!!!,"I ordered this to replace a toaster oven that I had picked up at Lowe's. I am so glad, I read the review and wasn't quiet sure how this would arrive. Man o man, THIS IS THE BEST TOASTER WE HAVE EVER OWNED HANDS DOWN!!! We are big bagel eaters at our house and I love the dual toasting capabilities. I read others say that the toasting is uneven and have to say that we have never experienced that, it is a great buy and looks cool too!!"
4,"If space is the problem, this is the solution.","We've been using this toaster/oven for about two years ago. Although it toasts somewhat unevenly it more than makes up for this shortcoming by taking up so little room in our small kitchen. The oven works fine although it's on the smallish side. This unit has been reliable, easy-to-use and I have no inclination to replace it anytime soon. Again, if limited space is the issue for you I don't think you can do better than this model."
5,Excellent product but small oven compartment,"A big feature is that the unit doesn't take much space on the kitchen counter. Of course, that is because of the small oven compartment. The oven size is OK for cooking or heating small things. The toaster is a beautiful design, is easy to use, and has a sliding door to cover the toaster section when not in use. All in all, a great design."
2,Very Disappointing,"There are several things that I dislike: English muffins get stuck; you can't stop the toaster part way through, therefore bread burns from time to time; and generally not well made."
1,Complete waste of money,"This is a great toaster if:- You want half of your toast burnt and half cold.- You don't want to stop the toasting process early.- You only like to heat very, very small things in the oven portion.If you want something that works, however, this IS NOT the toaster oven you want. This is a piece of junk, and I'd rather heat my toast over burning tires."
3,Nice for the price,"We've had this toaster oven for a few months and we like it. As one other reviewer noted, english muffins don't fare very well in this device, but they don't get mangled in ours; just a little curved. It's not the easiest to clean, either. But the oven works great, bagels brown beautifully and plain bread does well. And it looks really cool."
1,What a piece of junk,This is the perfect little toaster if you like your food burned to a crisp on the top and uncooked on the bottom!! And it can't even toast bread evenly! What a piece of junk.
5,Toaststation 101 for Dummies...,The way to pop the toast up on the Hamilton Beach Toaststation is by moving the lever from Toast to Oven. [LOL!!!] It only took me less than a minute to figure that one out. [LOL!!!]
4,Hamilton each Toaster Oven,Hamilton Beach toaster oven:I like all the features except I haven't been able to determine what setting to use for the pop up toast that suits me. Also when I want to pop the toast up ahead of the cycle it is very hard to do and when the lever finally pops up the toast comes completely out of the toaster! But it is never boring making toast!
4,HB Toaster Oven,"This product is a better toaster than oven, but works great, and serves two purposes! The oven section is a little smaller than the conventional toaster oven because the toaster utilizes the same space. You have to be careful not to insert anything in the oven section that's too high; space is limited; tray measures 6""x10"", adequate for most things. We like it!"
5,Great toaster and toaster oven,We really like this product so far and it takes up so much less counter space than having a toaster oven and a pop-up toaster.
3,mini oven,good for toast or a small item in the oven. Not alot of room for more than 1 serving. Doesn't take up alot of space and just fine for single person.
2,Not a good buy,"While this little toaster/mini oven looks great, it has turned out to be disappointing. I had to watch over the toast so it wouldn't burn. It does not brown evenly either, leaving light spots on all the toast. You can't just use two slots for toasting, because all four slots heat up at the same time. The BACK of the toaster gets hot, so you have to move it away from anything that might melt or burn. Not a good buy. While Hamilton Beach has been a good brand over the years, they need to go back to the drawing board on this one!"
2,Would not recommend,"Just as reviews stated, toast falls through, the thing is really too small! I think I need to spend more to get what I want. I returned it. Amazon is thr best about returns and paid for my return shipping. No discussion."
1,"uncleanable, disposable toaster oven (you're better off w/ a different one)","Have had for a year. It works fine until it needs cleaning. My biggest problem is that it is impossible to clean thoroughly. The door does not come off, the lower part of the oven is not removable for cleaning. You can remove the gril, the small pan and another pan at the bottom of the oven; however if crumbs fall anywhere else (e.g. the very bottom of the oven, the heating element protector, the door), they're going to stay. So, when this toaster oven gets dirty internaly, you'll have to toss it and buy another one.... better off buying a different oven."
1,"all looks, no quality","PROS:very nice lookingfits well in a small kitchenCONS:broke after 1 yeartoast, waffles, and bagels slip between toaster catch and oven making it very difficult to fish one's food out!no automatic shutoffno timer"
4,Works great,No probs. Need to read directions and experiment. Breads are different and the machine doesn't the difference. There's just two of us and it fulfils our needs
2,Won't last,"The idea is good but it doesn't last. The machine lasted a little over 1 year of light use. The inside rack becomes unhinged from the door and you can't close the door without removing rack. The oven is smaller than other smaller ovens (I liked it initially because the unit wasn't that big). Also, once the rack 'breaks' it'll effect your toaster-ation. The toasts won't pop up anymore. It should last longer than a year. No more Hamilton Beach. Black and Decker is better from my experience even though that's not exactly the top of the line."
1,I HATE THIS TOASTER!,"Sorry to be so blunt, but it truly reflects my sentiments. It was my first Hamilton Beach product, afraid it will be my last.I fell for the ""cute"" factor. Kept it for 6 months, mainly because I paid $40 for it and I was reluctant to spend money on another toaster for a while. I put up with it as long as I could. It burned EVERYTHING in the oven part, the heating element was too close to the rack. Nice, melty cheese on toast? Nope. Just flaky brown burnt cheese on burnt bread. Cinnamon toast? Nope. Just burnt sugar on burnt bread. As for the pop-up portion, it was impossible to get the toast out. I ended up giving it to my neighbor and purchased another toaster."
3,Toaster-oven combo,"Basically works well. Toaster does its job in just a couple minutes, which is considerably faster than toasting bread in a mini-oven. Evenness of toasting is not great but acceptable. Mini-oven warms up quickly and does acceptable job as well. On the downside, the oven has no timer to turn itself off. There is also a 1/4-inch groove at the bottom of the door on the inside that collects crumbs and is difficult to clean out."
3,WHY WON'T YOU SHUT!!!,"On the whole I am happy with this item but the door will not shut all the way when using as a toaster....arggghhhhhh.I already owned the same product, which I believe I bought years ago at Kohl's. I was happy to find it available online for a reasonable price. It came within days of ordering, which was great. The only problem is the door does not fully shut when using as an oven. Very annoying and frustrating."
2,My toaster is toast...,"Have had this for about 6 months. Don't use it very often - maybe 3x a week. Recently the toaster part stopped working - damn thing won't stay down. My daughter likes frozen waffles. I have now burnt several waffles trying to ""toast"" them in the oven part. Needless to say, this is infuriating. Burn me once, shame on me. Burn me twice, shame on you, Hamilton Beach. Shame on you."
3,great idea bad design,"This was a fantstic idea but the design is flawed in several ways...first the oven needs to be taller inside, anything of height burns on the top elementsecond needs a crumb tray, almost impossible to clean and remove crumbs even when turning upside and shaking"
1,Toaster Oven that can't toast or oven,"The oven burns the outside of food and leaves the inside raw. Yes, I played with the temperature to see if it just ran a bit hot to no avail. Items fall from the toaster slot and into the oven, making them difficult to dislodge them. Here are some of the items I tried to cook in the oven: pizza, frozen biscuits. Here are items I tried to toast in the toaster slots: bagals, eggo waffles."
5,The Gotta Have Toaster Oven,"This product was actually a birthday gift for my mother, but she said it's the most awesome toaster oven she's ever had. Coming from her, I'd say i out did myself this time! Thanx."
1,Awful product.,Awful design. Since the toaster part of the Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation toaster and Mini-oven takes up 3/4 of the space of the oven there isn't even room to bake a potato. I would stop stocking this item if I were you. Resented having to pay such a high shipping price to return it.
1,Great for setting baked goods on fire.,"""Hey, that's a good idea"" I said to myself as I shopped for a toaster-oven. But neither the toaster nor the oven do the job very well. I just came back from throwing this into the dumpster. I would give it to a thrift store, but I wouldn't want someone else to be burdened with it."
2,poor toasting,"The small size fits on my small countertop and the oven works fine. BUT, if I try to toast anything heavier than a small piece of bread it falls right through - waffles, bagels, 2 slices of bread, etc. So I end up trying to toast everything in the oven portion and it just doesn't cook the same. If I had to do it again, I would not choose a model tries to combine oven with pop-up toaster and just go for the good old-fashioned toaster oven."
3,"Ready, set, toast!","The best feature of this toaster oven is its size. For anyone with limited counter space, it solves the problem. The oven function is fine. However, as other reviewers have noted, toast tends to literally fly out so you need to be prepared. Toasting function is also very uneven: burned edges and under toasted center. I have yet to have an english muffin that didn't have charred edges or an under cooked middle. I yearn for my old Black and Decker spacesaver."
3,Problem is....,"Let's say you want to toast a bagel or half a baguette in the bottom section. You can, but you have to sit in front of the thing and watch it, because the toast selection knob only applies to the top section. So on the bottom section, you have to turn it on and off manually.Or let's say you put bread in the top section and it comes out not quite brown enough, so you push it down a second time, and then you need to stop it before it completes its cycle...if you manually pull the toast up, it flies across the room like in old cartoons. It's not a problem when the toast pops up on its own, but it is if you have to manually pull it up.Cute concept, but it needs some work."
1,KBC,"I'm amazed to read good reviews about this toaster. My husband and I both hate it! It toasts very slowy, and unevenly (tends to be very dark on the bottom and light or uncooked in the middle) and the ""oven"" part is too small to heat even a small loaf of french bread. The profile is wonderful.. it looks great on the counter but it is a waste of money! I will be putting mine in next year's yard sale."
1,horrible,"I'm on Amazon right now looking for a replacement for this junk. It burns almost everything you put in it, largely due to it's inability to toast evenly, you'll end up with a burnt line on a piece of toast everytime. I believe Consumer Reports also singled this toaster out as the only one to avoid in their test group. Stay away!"
2,"Uneven toasting, no way to manually stop toasting","Very disappointed. Toasting is very uneven - dark in some spots, light in others. Also, there is no mechanism for manually stopping toasting. If you choose ""dark"", you have to wait through the entire dark time cycle. There is no way to stop it once desired darkness is reached."
3,Hamilton Beach Toastation,"I love that this product is 2 in one. I have a very small kitchen and it helps to have both a toaster and toaster oven in one. The toaster works great. The toaster oven is adequate. Those small frozen pizzas tend to get a little burned on the top - I don't know if it's because the oven is so small. You really have to watch your food so it doesn't get burned. Even with this little issue, it's not a bad buy. I got mine with rewards points - so no loss. It would be nice if it came with a little bigger toaster oven. I actually would recommend it for any one with limited space in a small kitchen."
1,Doesn't do anything well,"If I could give it a minus star, I would. VERY slow at making toast and then bad, uneven toast at that. Can't put anything of any appreciable size in the oven. It's just unbelievable that a company can put a product like this out on the market. Now I have to go buy a real toaster and put this in somebody's benefit yard sale."
2,Not as large a advertised,"pictures shows toaster with two slices of pizza inside. Very misleading...pizza slices in picture must have been from a 10"" personal pizza. Product seems cheaply constructed and not very durable."
2,Too small!!,I really wanted to like this thing. It's cute. It looks handy. But it's just too small. A baguette will not fit inside the oven bit. It's REALLY small!
4,better toaster than oven,"my wife wanted a toaster, but felt that a toaster/oven combo would be a good compromise. This isn't bad, but it's more a toaster with a small oven than a true best of both worlds. the oven will do small things, and can fit a rather flat bake potato in it, but i have to reheat pizza one slice at a time. take a look at the dimensions of the oven pan as it might not be as big as you think.for the price though, it's worth it just for the toaster. i like the ""Cancel"" button that will release our toast."
3,Good toaster for the price!,"For the price, this is a good toaster/mini oven. It looks good, is light and slim, which I like, although it's slimness does mean it doesn't fit as much in the oven as the dinosaur it replaced. It also tends to cook a bit faster, even at low temps, so if you are used to a bigger oven, beware. It toasts fine. The only drawback so far is getting the crumb tray out-the door angle is awkward, so it takes a little finagling."
2,Toaster Worked Well Until It Didn't,"I was excited to get this toaster and loved the fact that it could work as a toaster over or a toaster. This toaster worked extremely well for a month or two, then tonight it quit working for no apparent reason. While it worked well while it worked, I do not believe that the toaster was worth the money for only being able to use it for about two months."
2,Disappointed in toaster function,"We use this primarily for toasting, and the toaster tray does not extend deep enough into the unit. Top of the bread does not get toasted. Looking thru the window it appears the tray physically could drop down another inch or so, but the mechanism won't allow. Also, there is no cancel function. If you need to stop the toasting process you have to force the toaster handle up."
2,Glass Shattered After 2 Weeks,"We liked this product while it worked, although it did take a bit longer to heat up in general and toast things. But after only 2 weeks of use, I was preheating the oven and the glass completely shattered for no apparent reason. Guess we'll be buying a separate toaster and oven."
4,Just like expected,"I read a few reviews when I purchased this toaster. I was worried about uneven toasting. So far it actually has been working good (I had the toaster for the past 2 weeks). I am having no issues with uneven toasting. And I actually like the idea that the crumbs fall on a tray in the main oven. Makes it easy to clean.The bottom oven is just a regular oven with no timer. So you just need to pay attention when you put anything in there.This toaster allows you to toast not only toast bread and bagels but other types of bread such as pita pockets.So far, I am satisfied."
2,Too small!!,"I never used this toaster oven. It appeared to be fine for toast, but I could not put a baked potato inside. It was too small to hold a baked potato or a French roll. It is only good for flat items like french fries or bread. What a disappointment! Clever idea to have the toaster on the top, but it is not at all practical. Nothing in the product description gave that information, which is pretty important to me. For us, the search for a decent toaster oven goes on!"
2,It is what it is....,"The fact you can't quickly 'pop' items that may be burning out of the toaster is a deal breaker for me. It does work well, but is very limited. If a slice of pizza is thick, it may not even fit in the thing. If space is limited, it is a nice little unit."
1,"Little toaster, big problem","I've used this toaster/oven for a couple of years now, and have never been satisified with it. The ""oven"" is so small there is nothing that will fit into it without touching the heating element. It is hard to clean too. The door to the oven is really tricky to get opened without burning yourself. When you use the toaster, it has to finish the time it was set on, you can't stop it early even if what you're toasting is charring! The outside of the unit heats up also, so be careful about touching it when heated."
1,Lasted less than 4 months,"My parents got me this cute little toaster oven last Christmas. I am redesigning my kithcen in a retro look and this one, in red, fit beautifully. Unfortunately, after only a few months the switch that changes the function from pop-up toaster to oven stopped working. The little door on top would close but the heat wouldn't turn on. Hubby tried fixing it but he couldn't get the body open enough to even see the switch, never mind attempt a fix.This thing was a huge disappointment."
1,Overly complex junk,"This toaster oven has a rather clever gimmick, i.e., that you can have a pop-up toaster and oven in one appliance. Unfortunately, the control which switches the appliance to oven mode broke almost immediately upon receipt, so much for Hamilton Beach quality! Unfortunately, also, the side lever which operates the toaster cannot be released once it is pushed down! It is locked down until the thermostat releases it. Fortunately, there is a work-around to this problem, namely, turning the darkness setting for the toast to its lowest setting. Still, why lock the lever? Bad design.Bottom line, buy a conventional toaster oven and save your money. This is a gimmick not worth buying."
1,Hamilton Beach Toaster Oven,"Do NOT buy this piece of junk. While our youngest was heating up an Eggo waffle, the door exploded, showering him and most of the kitchen in shards of glass.Contacting HB Customer Service is of little help as it takes 2 or 3 days before anyone responds to an email. So of course, by the time they got back to us to propose a remedy, the thing was long gone with the rest of the garbage, and since we couldn't return the dead appliance, they won't replace it (which I don't want anyway - the first one failed in a spectacularly dangerous way; why would I want another one?). And refunding my money is apparently not an option.I'm not taking any unnecessary chances with the safety of my family, so I'll be avoiding Hamilton Beach products all together."
2,Small but not so great,"I bought this unit to replace another (very old) one that had died. Two of my friends each have this one, and they said they like it. As soon as I bought this toaster- I regretted it. It is nearly impossible to get the crumbs out of the bottom- even when using the crumb tray. The toasting tray got stuck and I had to bend it to get it out, so now I can't get it back in. The door doesn't close all the way, as if it's twisted. I could go on and on, but let me just say that if you're looking for a space saving toaster- keep looking, this one is not worth it!"
3,toaster oven,"Hamilton Beach 22708H Toastation ToasterIt's very nice looking and doesn't take up a lot of counter space, but the toaster part, my bread gets caught in it and I have to fish it out. I haven't used the oven yet. I'm so so about it, but for the price it's not bad."
4,"Cute, Small and match my kitchen","I love the style, unique, cute and small. Never seen a toaster with a conventional oven before. Only thing I dislike is the cleaning part. Kinda hard to remove the burned stuff especially for pizza as I don't use the tray so I can toast the bottom part of the pizza but other than that, I love looking and using this thing... =)"
1,Small size doesn't not a good toaster/toaster oven make,"If you want a small toaster oven that does not take up much counter space. This is the toaster oven for you. Its got good heat. So, you might want to be careful with little ones around. Sadly, it does not cook evenly. If you only toast bagels. This is the toaster for you. It just is not good for toasting more than one piece of toast at a time. Also it does not have a cleaning tray to dispose of crumbs. I am just too obsessive for the cleaning method involved with everyday use to put up with the mess for long. I was very sad this did not work for me, but hey I learned something."
2,not a good choice,"I am disappointed in this product. It is cute and takes little space. However, the oven is useless. It is too small for most anything and even with small foods, the food burns rather than bakes. If I could return it I would. The toaster does not toast evenly."
5,Not bad for a little guy,"I bought this for work, I have a small office and we have to be in at 7:00 am. This is the perfect size for breakfest food, and lunches. One draw back, NO TIMER. Other than that for the price its great."
2,no timer,I thought this would fit the bill for reducing counter top clutter. Only problem is there is no timer on the oven and almost caused a fire as one has to watch it carefully. Otherwise it would be perfect.
2,Maybe australia power a bit much for this toaster,"This toaster looked like a great idea and like nothing I had seen here in australia BUT you put your bread in, the toaster goes bright in color and next thing your bread is buring and if you dont get it out fast enough you will see flames. I am thinking that because our power here is a different wattage and even though I am using a converter I think maybe not a good idea with a toaster, especially since my house is wooden. It just cooks way to fast even on the lowest setting"
1,"Beware - no ""Toaster Oven"" mode!","If you simply want to make some cheesy toast, or anything similar, there is no automatic timer for the oven part.This appliance is really just a toaster and a mini oven. It is not a ""Toaster Oven.""You can do timed toasting. You can use it as an oven.However, to use it as a toaster oven, requires manual intervention, because the timer only works in toaster mode."
1,"Good idea, but hard to clean!","I thought this toaster oven would be the perfect thing for my lunches at work. However, because it is almost impossible to clean, I have had several fires at work because of bits of cheese or bread crumbs on the bottom of the oven. There is no tray at the bottom which pulls out. Even turning the unit upside down does not get rid of baked on cheese that melted off a piece of pizza. I've only had mine a few months, but am throwing it out because I seriously consider it a fire hazard!"
4,Toastation 2-slice toaster & oven,"I ordered the Toastation to replace the one I had owned for several years. I didn't want a gigantic toaster oven taking up counter space and this one is perfect for smaller items, and for toasting bread, waffles, bagels, etc. If you are looking to do a lot of cooking in a toaster oven this isn't the one for you, but if re-heating or cooking small amounts of food and toasting bread or other items is the extent of your need for a toaster/toaster oven then I recommend the Toastation 2-slice toaster/mini oven."
4,Hamilton Beach 22708,Great to have this toaster. Perfect fit on counter top table. No bulky. Go for Hamilton Beach without any regret.
4,Great bang for a low price,"Mind you this is just a toaster/mini oven, but for what it does, it does it real well. We bought this because the original one we had was old and had been stained with various foods that had dripped onto the bread holder bar that goes across. Because of these stains, the toaster started to smoke a little from where the food stains were and that little smoke kept setting off the smoke alarm, so we decided to get another one.....another exact same one.Two Thumbs Up !"
2,Couldn't go the distance,"This toaster/oven combination is a good idea, but there are some design flaws, and ultimately it was a disappointment due to its short life-span. We got it less than 3 years ago, and the top heating element just quit on us. Maybe it's naive of me to expect anything to last longer than 3 years anymore, but I was most disappointed by this. Other than that, it works pretty much as advertised, though due to the toaster and oven portions using the same heating elements, it's not really designed to do either particularly well. It's also very difficult to clean. We replaced it with a Waring WTO150, which is a little larger, but seems to be designed better. Now just to see how long it lasts..."
2,Toaster Lever Broke After Only One Year,"Loved the size, design and look of this toaster/oven. However, the toaster lever which one uses to start the toasting process, broke after a year of use. Very disappointing!!"
2,Read this first,"I would have given this 5 stars when I first purchased it. I have a tiny counter and it looked just perfect sitting there. Now here's a list of problems:1) The tempature is totally OFF! At 350 degrees anything burns.2) The food next to the sides stay cool and the food under the 2 heating elements gets brown, totally uneven cooking.3) It really is for a single person living alone. If you try to put enough food in there for more than that it will touch the heating element on top.4) The toaster is a disaster! The breads keep sliding off the track. It also wont browns evenly and I could go on and on.So... For design it can get 5 stars but for function a zero!"
1,burned toast,"disappointed with this item - thin items like a slice of bread tend to fall from the toaster area down into the oven area, so bread comes out curved and unevenly toasted. Crumbs tend to collect around the burners so that every time I use the toaster, previous crumbs start burning and leave the heavy odor of burnt toast in my house. I have to turn on my oven fan and open my kitchen sliding door basically every time I use the darn appliance."
1,terrible toaster over,"This toaster oven is awful - there is NO cancel button - that little thing above the temperature control for the oven part is a red light only - ugh! there is no way to cancel the toaster except by forcing the handle up which is very, very hard to do and if you are able to, it is so hard to do that the toast pops out way on the other side of your kitchen! I do not trust that there is now a cancel button - I'd have to see it in person. I do NOT recommend this toaster oven!"
3,"Awesome design and cool look, but Amazon abused it","This toaster was for my girlfriend because she want a toaster oven that was strictly gluten-free. She opened it up and was so delighted and throughly impressed with its design, unfortunately we never got to use it. In the shipping process the Amazon packer decided to get all beginning scene of Ace Venture on it and really roughed it up. i am sending it back today, so let see how it goes, but it was a big hit for xmas, non the less. Here is your package sir. Sounds broken. Most likely sir, but I am sure it was nice. Sign here."
4,combo toaster,The HB Toastation is a unique combination that is over priced and works okay. The oven is really mini and the toaster side toasts unevenly. It's nice to have both options but it needs to be a bit larger and there needs to be improvement in the overall design.
1,Top elements broke after a few weeks,"I was initially impressed with the cute looks and space saving features of this new product. It even toasted bagels well (although thinner pieces of bread folded in the slot and toasted unevenly). The oven is perfect for a piece of pizza and maybe a few fishsticks. Anyway, I was satisfied enough until I attempted to use it yesterday. My bagel NEVER browned-soon realized the top elements were not functioning at all. I'm pretty disgusted especially since I just tossed the receipt and box as I planned on keeping it. I'm very disappointed in Hamilton Beach."
2,Get a toaster instead,"The toaster function works fine but the oven is too small and has no timer. Its basically useless. Just get a toaster, its smaller and will serve the same function."
2,Not the greatest,"Although this is a good idea, there are a lot of practical shortcomings to this toaster oven. Firstly, the absence of a timer on the oven function is a big mistake. Secondly, the oven itself is so small that it is impossible to even heat french bread without singing the top.This makes the item unusable as anything other than a toaster. The toaster function is only adequate. i.e. anything other than a standard piece of toast or a bagel gets stuck in the toaster opening. Also the cancel button torpedos the toast across the kitchen. Very attractive to look at, very inexpensive, great idea but not practically useful."
1,Awful Toaster,"The oven part of this works alright, but it is impossible to keep clean! The toaster however is awful! It claims to be the most even toast. It is everything but! The only heating element is in the middle of the bread slice, so ever piece of toast gets a burnt piece right along the center. The rest of the piece isnt even toasted!"
1,it HIT me with 20 VOLT!!!!!!!!!,"We bought this toaster about one year ago. Yesterday I put some bread in it and turned it on. Then I wanted to check if the oven is empty and touched the handle to open it. It hit me!!! We measured the voltage afterwards- the handle still have 20 volts!!! It doesn't hit you if you wont touch another electronic item or ground at the same time(I touched fridge), however I believe nobody would want to try it..."
2,Too Small Inside,"I had carefully measured the outside dimensions of my old toaster-oven, but had not measured the inside.The oven area of this item is so small it cannot toast a muffin or similar larger item without burning the top of it."
2,Fine As A Toaster. Not So Good As An Oven,"My girls are into toaster waffles and the like and we wanted a pop-up toaster.And it works fine that way.But as an oven, it is not very useful. The tray is tiny and the heating element is set too close to the level of the tray. Things burn quickly if unwatched--I've burned reheating pizza slices several times.Bottom line? I wish I'd stuck with the toaster oven--it's a lot more versatile."
2,misleading,"The oven does NOT have an automatic shutoff. The words ""automatic shutoff"" refer to a button on the toaster to pop up the toast. Very disappointing."
1,Toasterover Review,"Was very disappointed in this product. I selected this toaster and mini oven because it was a 2 in 1 appliance (toaster and minioven) so would take less space than having both on my counter. That was a mistake. I regret not checking it out in Consumer Report magazine. It does not toast well and the mini oven is very small - barely holds a mini pizza. And, it collects crumbs that are very difficult to get out - they stick in crevices and then start to burn when you toast something new. Recommend reading ratings on these products before ordering. But, Amazon shipping was excellent and on time. Amazon is the best!!"
1,Looks great works horrible,Bought this toaster oven with high hopes. Had one a few years ago (different brand) and LOVED it. We have had a plain toaster for a few years and missed the oven. Someone recomended this one to us. We were very excited when it came but it stinks. Works HORRIBLE! The bread toasts uneven and bends. One half of bread is burnt the other barely toasted. The toaster oven burns things to easily. Would not recomend this to anyone!!!!
1,"unevenly toasts, difficult to clean","This toaster oven toasts a stripe on one side of the toast so you have to keep turning it around to get it toasted on both sides. The oven is too small for any kind of pan to fit it and it burns things on the top. It is impossible to clean as there is no way to open the bottom to clean it and there is no way to get the stuck on burnt stuff off of the bottom so it burns and smokes when you use it.Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation 2-Slice Toaster and Mini Oven, Black"
5,AWESOME,"It works great, takes up minimal space and switching from the oven to the toaster is as easy and moving the lever! It rules!"
2,"Great Idea, major problem","I loved the idea of this appliance--a small compact toaster oven that toasted bread, bagels and English muffins the ""old fashioned"" way with a drop-in slot. The size and the toasting function are terrific. However, the toaster oven component has a huge flaw. It is almost impossible to remove or insert the oven tray smoothly or with ease or close/open the oven door. Right now, my Toastation sits with tray removed and and oven door jammed closed. I'm left to use my oven through the hot summer months! Cannot recommend this product."
2,Problems with door,"Purchased the unit because my parent have the four slice model (discontinued) and like it a lot... Used the toaster twice and when I was going to use the oven portion, had an issue opening the door. When I opened the door, it seemed to have bent the frame of the door and then could not close properly. The warranty policy with HB was a little difficult, and it is very annoying especially when the unit is only 1 week old. They are sending me another one under warranty, but annoyed with inconvenience."
2,Buyer Beware,I am greatly disappointed in the Toastation. If the slice is small it sometimes falls through to the bottom. The height of the bread can be a problem. If it is taller than a bagel it sticks up above the heating area. If the bread is placed too close to the side it sometimes burns around the edges. Removing the crumb tray is difficult and I have not been able to remove the oven rack to clean it. Would not recommend it.
4,HB mini oven and toaster,i like the product. It has nice wide and long bread and bagel slot for toasting. Easy to use. The mini oven is very small or rather not tall enough. Taller pastries burn and many do not fit at all. Good for cheese toast and pizza though. If it were just an inch or two taller this would be perfect.
2,Not What We Thought,"My wife and I bought this item because we thought we would have access to a toaster that toasted bread better than a toaster oven and also have access to an oven for other cooking needs. A single appliance that did the work of two and saved space. However we soon learned that the ""toaster"" does not toast as well as the oven, and more importantly, the ""oven"" is very small. There is vey little depth to the appliance. The literature indicates the oven can fit 2 slices of pizza on the rack. In my opinion, the slices would have to be very narrow, and even then you might have to place the slices on top of each other. But even that might not work if the end crusts were thick because there isn't much height from the rack to the bottom of the toaster section.Hamilton Beach offers a 4-slice toaster oven that probably offers greater depth but we will most likely purchase a traditional toaster oven soon."
5,Combination Toaster oven/Toaster,"I love it....just small enough to not take up too much counter space. So far, I use the toaster part most of the time; but this is such a practical toaster/oven for us."
2,Very small oven area,Oven area and opening so small that you cannot get even a medium size potato in for baking. Limited usefullness as an oven.
1,"not great ,too bad",a little big for being able to toast only 2 slices at a time. as toaster is ok. as oven not really good i would not consider it a toaster oven. is more like a warming chamber with a tendency to burn. good for warming pizza. i wanted a toaster and this allows me to keep the toast warm so it works for me. UPDATE:it started to burn everything! Not even a month. I'm returning!
1,oven too shallow for proper cooking,This toaster looks great along my stainless/ black top oven but it's performance it not great. The toaster works ok but the oven is too shallow. Anything taller than a slice a bread burns the tops before it is heated through. I would not recommend this toaster oven.
4,It's a Steal for the price,"It's not perfect, like some said, it does pop the toasts in the air when taken out mid toasting, but once it happens u be careful the next time and for the price, it's awesome. Does everything u need a toaster/oven to do! I'd recommend a friend to get it."
3,Great but Ugly/Hamilton Beach Toastation,"This product is great as it is a good toaster and toaster oven all in one! Less counter space needed. However, If you have a nice updated kitchen with granite, etc.......it is very cheap looking. The visual design could use some help."
3,Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation Toaster,I liked the concept of the toastation a lot so I purchased one. I noticed right away that you cannot put anything thin in the top and toast it as it will fall through to the bottom of the broiler. a bagle or thick bread works fine. The lever to pop up the toast does not work well and I have had a few burnt items because of this. I still love the little broiler and have taken to using it and forgetting about the toaster part of this little machine.
4,Toastation toaster oven / toaster,"Fairly basic as far as design and appearance, but it does the job! I like that it doesn't take up a bunch of space, and it works quite well. However, there is no ""broil"" and I wish the ""baking sheet"" was made with thicker metal (feels a bit flimsey) but again, it all works as promissed and the price wasn't bad, either."
5,A Gem!,"When needing a new toaster, I found this GEM on Amazon and ordered it. We quickly found the large single slot to be very handy for tall slices since they can be laid down to toast, unlike regular toasters with TWO slots. But the best part of this toaster is the small oven in the bottom of one side. It's just handy as a hip pocket for all kinds of things and it is large enough to accomodate warming food for two people. I highly reccommend this toaster. The price is reasonable, the quality is wonderful, and the versatility is (I'm running out of superlatives) a super idea which works beautifully. Buy it!"
3,good for small spaces,"I don't have too much to complain about this toaster ...It's much smaller than I thought it was going to be .. although that hasn't really been an issue since I haven't used it for anything bigger than a slice of bread or a bagel.The one thing I don't really like about it .. is once you start toasting something, you can't stop it. It's not like a traditional toaster that way where you can just open the door and the toasting stops. Once you push the lever down, you're committed.But I would recommend this unit if you have a small kitchen."
3,Toastation,"We bought this to replace our toaster oven which toasts very slowly. However, we use the oven feature a lot, and I have a stoneware baking tray that I use in the toaster oven. We ended up sending back the Toastation before ever using it because the oven portion of it was too small for the baking tray."
4,GREAT TOASTER,I PURCHASED THIS LITTLE TOASTER OVEN 2 YEARS AGO AND USE IT DAILY. THE OVEN WORKS GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO EATS TOAST AND BAGELS. ALSO IS GREAT FOR WARMING LEFT OVER PIZZA AND OTHER FOOD AS WELL.
2,Too Small,"This toaster is too small to really cook anything. The toaster wrinkles the bread and therefore will burn one end. Do not recommend this product. You get what you pay for, I guess."
2,Disappointing,"Usually browns one side more than the other. Only way to turn it off is to unplug it. Sometimes the toast flies out of the toaster, other times it gets stuck. Thermostat has a mind of its own. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Not So Good With Toast,"This is a very attractive little appliance but if you want actual toast then maybe you should skip it. Slices of bread constantly get stuck because I think the top portion is really made for bagels. It also produces hard toast, no matter what the setting. It looks nice with my stainless steel appliances but I think Hamilton needs to tweek the design a bit. I rated it 3 stars mainly because it's stylish, but if given a choice now I wouldn't purchase this model."
1,Don't even bother. A plain ol' toaster would be a better choice,"This toaster was alright at first, just minor annoyances, but after about a year of use, I just can't stand it anymore. The toasting bit goes down into the oven, so its just a little catch to hold up your toast. Almost everything I put in gets caught, which forces me to either a) unplug it and mutilate it with a fork until it comes out or b) violently jam the toaster button up and down until it comes loose. Waffles are especially susceptible. There is also no timer on this thing. NO TIMER? What the hell? You have to either have some external timer to use, or stand right there and watch it, as it goes from edible to burnt in a matter of seconds. Also, the tray that came with it does not fit inside, and the door doesn't close all the way when you use it.Talk about a waste of money."
1,Don't buy it!,Get frustrated with every use. Had and enjoyed my Black and Decker for years but bought this when B and D was unavailable. No timer... must stand by and watch... shoots toast out like a cannon (really funny). Every thing is like being top toasted when in the over part. Can't bake anything because the top is burnt and the bottom is uncooked!! Why I put up with it this long I don't know. Should have returned it immediately. Now can't find the sale slip. Still not certain which brand to buy as I'm limited in space.
2,I THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE !,"When I first bought this key safe I tought that it would be safe. It was encased safely into a rubber cover that fit snuggely on the box and I was convince that this safety box was truly safe. So I thought...It was installed last year. Once and while I would check to see if it was in good ordr and it was. I notice one morning that someone had tried to open the rubber cover and see what was inside. I knew this because the cover was left not exactly snug as it is suppose to be. Then last Saturday I locked my self outside. And lo and ehold it would not take the conbination. When the locksmith came, he use a medium size ordinary screwdriver and pop open easily the metal cover and I retrieved my keys...So easy it was for him to open this cover It was scary. So I am giving 1 star and I got a KeySafe Original 5-key Spin-Dial - Black from GE Interlogix SUPRA from a local locksmith store. This one nobody can open this box. I learned my lesson."
2,Tango and Waltz do not mix,"This video mixes two very different dances. Tango is so different from waltz that it should be in a separate video. Additionally, the tango here is of the ballroom variety, which looks and sounds nothing like the authentic Argentine Tango."
1,This game stinks,This game stinks because it has no point and is really dumb.No one should buy this because as soon as you get to the ice level with the Biesin it's impossible to beat. This game is also dumb because when you shot the person with a rocket they don't die. By any game but this one.
2,NO Mandrel For Holesaw - Picture Very Misleading,"There is not a Mandrel attached to the holesaw, which would be fine, if there were a Link to purchase one. I have yet to find one not only on amazon, but on the web. The box has a part number for the Quick change mandrel, but every search I do only yealds a link for a replacement bit for the mystical mandrel. If anyone could help, I would appreciate it very much. It would be nice to be able to use the hole saw, Or it isn't worth a dime."
4,I love it!,"When I first found out I was pregnant, I didn't know how I wanted to decorate the nursery. I first thought of doing Classic Pooh, but then thought a lot of people do that. I then saw the Moonbeam set and instantly fell in love with it. I wanted it even before I found out I was having a boy. It goes either way, even with all the blue. The only thing I did not like was the bumper. I found it did not fit right I tried several different ways to put it and it still never fit right. I also did not like that it only had ties on the top. I still recommend the set to anyone though."
4,Almoust Perfect,"Nice design. Goes well with everything ( except bright red ). There are more cool additions for it in your local baby's r us.If the sheet they included was 100% cotton, it would have been 5 stars."
5,Perfect!,"Adorable! The bedding is gorgeous and can be used for a boy or a girl. The bedding also has a lot of accessories for the nursery. We have the lamp, wall hangings and pillow. The colors are great and the bedding is very soft. I originally did not like the bedding when I viewed it online, but when I saw it in the store I knew that this was it!"
4,Great Set!,"We bought this bedding set, and 18 mos later, I have no regrets. The pattern is great, the fabrics are soft, and the matching accessories were nice. We used this set in a nursery that was painted a cream color, and it looked great. After a move, we used the matching border, and while it was a bit busy, our son loves it. The only drawback is the bumper. Most of the bumper only had top-ties (some of which came undone), but it was easy to replace them and add bottom ties. The bumper also has collapsed over time, sort of folded over, but this is probably due to rough toddler play. Overall, I am very happy with this set!"
4,This is so lovely.,"I am so happy to have purchased this set. The material is very soft and the colors create a very tranquil mood in the baby's room. True, the bumpers are a little difficult to tie perfectly on some newer-styled covertible crib such as ours. The ties are a little short. If you like the suns, moons, and stars theme, there are so many items you can buy to match this set."
2,Too short,"As a Collector's guide, any respectable one should have more than a few plate in color. Most of the image shown in this book come from other books published many years ago. If you take a look at the bibliography of this book you will be puzzle, so many good books are listed. So if it was the case, why Mr. Lumsden did'nt make a good summary of all of these books. It come short in terms of distinctive image. Short also in matter of description. If you intend to do a collector's guide, when you present a full battledress Waffen-ss you have to explained everything shown on the image, not just a collar patch or a belt buckle.I do not recommed this book to anyone wanting to know more about the waffen-ss uniforms, nor the firearms. It's so succint that it would'nt help you in a antique boutique. It's not even good to orient you in any specific detail._________________________Paul Bourgault2Lt/Fus MR21/34thCBG/RCAC"
4,A Helpful read! (014),"While I realize the limitations of a book of this size, I none the less found it a useful tool to help in the hobby of collecting German militaria. Of course a much larger format packed full of colour photos would have been better, but that is not the format of this book, and shouldn't be compared to larger, more comprehensive titles. As a general guide and/or an introductory book on the subject, it was well worth the money. I was very happy with it, and it prodded me to explore the subject further.A top read!"
3,Naughty Spanking Stories,Not worth your time. There are better books available about Spanking. This one needs to be spiced up and made for real. Too bland and 'white bread'.
4,Somthing for everyone - a little of everything.,"Its all here - M/M, F/F, F/M and M/F spanking action and it is all well-written, imaginative stuff. That is great if you like EVERYTHING. If your tastes are more particular, for example, you are not interested in one or two of the categories above, you may not be enthusiastic about some of the stories."
2,I liked it until it broke in less than a year.,"Call me old fashioned but I feel like an electronics product should work well until you drop it. This dvd-surround sound speakers worked great for awhile. One annoyance was that it wasn't compatible with our cable remote. Anyways, after about 9 months the thing stopped playing cds or dvds. No matter what you put in it says ""No Disc"". I had a ""fix"" where I'd take the top off and manually spin the cd when the tray was first closed to kickstart it into reading it. Less than a month after that this no longer worked. The year warranty only covered parts, not labor, but I lost the receipt so it's moot. Luckily I only paid $100, and I need a dvd-vcr combo anyways; since the speakers still work for tv I can probably patch them through this thing and still get some use out of it."
4,4 Stars For Being a Bargain...,"Got it at Circuit City for $120! Lots of bang for the buck. Plays almost all types of DVD and CD out there. So it's got only one audio input (and RCA at that), the 200w is more than enough for a medium size room."
4,"Slayers, so its good.","I love Slayers, easily the best series out there IMHO. Sadly though, its the last of the series. Try seems to lack a little of the story and animation quality that made the first two series absolutely fantanstic. Never the less, its Slayers so you need to buy this, right now!"
5,If you've followed the series you HAVE to get this one.,"Ok, I will try to make this short and sweet. If you already shelled out the cash to get the first 2 DVD collections ( slayers & Slayers Next) you have to get this one to see how to series turns out. Try is a very enjoyable series. Although not as good as NEXT, and not as fresh as the original, it is still crammed full of what makes Slayers such a fantastic series.Just go buy it, its better than 99% of whats out there."
5,Great Little Book,"This is a very informative book. There is much history and many little known facts that will surprise the reader. Good Job, Authors"
1,The worst game on any system,"What is this game supposed to be about? You pick a cartoony, deformed spice girl at the beginning and then you get to 'remix' one of their crappy songs and make it even crappier. Then you make some kind of video and get to change the camera angles while the deformed girls do the same dance moves over and over. That's all. Game over. There's also an interview with the girls that features terrible sound and choppy video, hinting that the game was made to rip money off spice fans who have probably never played a video game.Don't watse your money, even if you like their music."
3,It's fun for 2 seconds,"I bought this game for the nostalgia. I remember playing it when I was a wee little one. Playing it now, there's not much there. I guess, though, if you're still a die-hard Spice Girls fan (um...) it's got some interesting interviews. I'm probably not going to play this one much at all, but whatever."
3,Alright,"I bought the game in really good condition but the issue was it had the blockbuster rental sticker on it and I just wanted it normal.....it was still cool though, my niece loves the game"
4,Interesting and Informative,"I saw this video and immediately thought that it would make a good gift for some of my family members who stuggle with their weight. The video is really well done and Dr. Robert Pritikin presents well. Pritikin covers a lot of interesting information in the video. The topics that registered the most with me were the ones on how the human body reacts to surgar, and the tips on how best to develop an exercise routine. The video confirmed a lot of the advice that I have received over the years from other people."
4,It is an incredible suit,"Our little boy wanted an incredible suit for Halloween. He was only 2 1/2 years old so I was worried the suit would be too big, but it fit great. He loved the suit, and several months later he is still occasionally wearing it. The suit is well made and has yet to show any signs of wear."
1,"Poorly made, TOTAL garbage","While I know that Halloween costumes are typically cheaply made and over-priced for what you are getting, this is truly gives meaning to the word ""crap."" The thing, slinky material is see-through - you can't go trick-pr-treating in that without a few layers! Also, the ""i"" emblem on the front was messed up and looked like it hadn't been allowed sufficient time to dry before the item was packaged. To make it worse, returns are a complete pain. You have to email the merchant for a return authorization number or it will be refused at the door, and you only have until a certain date to return it. I will NEVER, EVER order rom this merchant again. Take heed to my warning no matter how much your little Peanut loves the Incredibles. Order from another merchant at the very least."
3,"OK, but cheaply made",We bought this for our son to wear for Halloween. Material is very thin and tore during the hour it was worn. Not what I would consider a quality item.
3,It's okay,"This is a good tool for pot weeding and don't leave in the sun and pick it up, it'll burn the heck out of you!!"
5,Super Sellers,The order I received was more than I expected. It included secondary filters for the vacuum which I had not thought about replacing. I also called them for some help with the installation and they were most gracious and patient. Would do business with them any day.
5,Bought for my SEBO X4,"OEM Box and contents. I go through a bag about every 3 months. Item was as described and shipment arrived quickly. You might find the equivalent for a bit less $ under the WINDSOR brand, which is the commercial equivalent of the SEBO brand. Many hotels use WINDSOR vacuums, but they are really SEBOs underneath. I love my X4 and these bags are perfect."
5,Heuristic value in the theory of morphics fields as memory,"As a neuropsychologist I found this book challenging. The theory of memory as morphic fields begins to explain phenomena such as the ""100 monkeys rule"" and the description of thought as a non-local event. Strongly recommend this book to any inquisitive mind."
4,exactly what we asked for,This part was needed for my son's car after we installed new stereo. Exactly what was needed and what we ordered. No problems.
2,a good collection ruined by over-filtering,"That Leopold Stokowski was one of a handful of truly great conductors of the 20th century is without doubt. This collection is at a good price but only for those new to his art. The set is of little or no value to collectors (hence my 2 stars) for 2 reasons: 1. recording dates are, for the most part, vague, and 2., the over use of filtering that removes the ""gritty"" sound of 78s but also robs the music of overtones that give life to the recordings, robbing most of the discs of their vitality. Only the Dvorak ""New World"" keeps the sound intact and shows what's missing from all of the other discs which sound flat and lifeless. Stokowski was always particular about the sound of his recordings from his earliest days but these fail to show that. Stay with releases on Andante and Pearl (both out of print but still around) or Archipel and other labels that preserve Stokowski as he was meant to be heard."
3,Great theme and creepy music.,"Don Davis's score for the high octane remake of William Castle's House on Haunted Hill gets off to an excellent start with the knock your socks off main theme. What follows that is nice, albeit not particularly special or memorable (with the exception of a cue or three), atmospheric enhancements. Great haunted house musice for those dark, foggy nights reading Stephen King or H.P. Lovecraft."
1,????,"When i saw the movie i wanted the soundtrack because of the marilyn manson song ""Sweet Dreams"" and to my surprise it was not listed in the tracks wassupwitdat?"
1,Terrible,"This ""Bloopers"" video has no bloopers at all. It has a bunch of fighters I've never seen or heard about, boxing like back in the 70's with no real words (other than a few announcers). The picture is terrible, and it is obvious that there were very low-tech camera's involved. On the box cover it shows some boxer punching out a referee, but that doesn't happen once in the video, and no like funny events at all. This was probably the worse video purchase I ever made."
2,Very little detail.,I was expecting a little more from a book entitled automotive electronics. If you are looking for a jack of all trades and master of none type book this one will give you an overview of most of the systems in an automobile but definitely not anything to do with electronics.
4,Finally!,"I looked for this book for a long time, and finally found it on Amazon. I was not disappointed. Anyone who is interested in the nuances of the Hebrew language (or, for that matter, any language) should read it."
3,Highly recommended!,"I would give it five stars, but Amazon tells me that that means 'I love it', and I don't emote in public, so I can only give it a neutral three, because of Amazon. I'll give it five, authors please note, when Amazon stops telling me what five stars mean. I know what five stars mean. I'm sure Amazon's customers are intelligent people, but it would seem that Amazon doesn't think so. Such is corporate ignorance, but I have no reservations in recommending it to anyone interested in Hebrew. I found it extremely interesting."
2,Not recommended for the novice glass collector,"Unless you are familiar with the Fostoria line, this is not the book for you. As a collector who is just acquainting herself with glass, the arrival of this book is met with great disappointment.Most pieces are unmarked, so a good reference to the patterns and color shades is valuable. Of the 240 pages, only 48 contain color pictures. The majority of the patterns are represented by black and white catalog clippings and silouette line drawings. Some patterns have no visual representation at all.There is also a small section dedicated to reproductions with the warning that no value can be given to reproduced items. However, there are no tips on how to spot a reproduction.Perhaps those already familiar with the patterns would find this a valuable tool, as the listings of pieces in each pattern appear to be complete and the patterns are sensibly listed in alphabetical order."
3,Check it out before you buy!,"I agree wholeheartedly with the other review of this book. However, I have faith that it one day will be valuable tool for me. For now, it sits on my shelf."
4,Enjoyable,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. At first, I wasn't quite sure where it was going and was pleased that I couldn't guess. Full of surprises, descriptive language that really kept me involved and turning the pages; I looked forward to my commute to indulge in this book. I found an excellent passage for husbands trying to understand wives...and excellent wisdom throughout about the importance of good communication in a marriage. Of course it is fiction but if you enjoy a good story about a relationship and it's ups and downs you will enjoy this book. I gave it four out of five stars only because it is Mr. Mizuno's first book and I don't want him to think there is nothing to top...I look forward to his next effort!"
1,Absolute worst experience with metrokitchen.com,"I ordered the Wusthof Grand Prix II but the seller sent the Wusthof Gourmet series knife which is inferior in quality. The seller would not honor the original transaction and blamed Amazon for listing the price incorrectly on this knife. Amazon said it's up to the seller whether to honor or not and will investigate which so far means that I am out of luck. I've never had such a horrible experience with a seller or with Amazon. I absolutely would not recommend purchasing items from this seller or with any third-party seller on Amazon. There are laws against misrepresentation and fraud but Amazon and its partner in this case do not seem to care. I am left unhappy and without the knife I purchased, promised only my money back (after many frustrating phone calls to both seller and Amazon). So how do I review a product properly if I'm sent the wrong one?"
4,Good product but a bit noisy,"This fan is good for a gentle breeze that does not blow everything off your desk. It's a bit noisy if you like it quiet, but if you normally have music playing you won't notice the fan noise. I bought it specifically to circulate air for my 100+ seedlings and it works perfectly for that. It keeps condensation off the seedlings but does not stress them."
5,Le Roi Arthus,I ordered this product on Nov 20. It took 25 days to arrive. The product was in good condition. This was my first experience ordering through Amazon. I would rate the purchase process as easy.
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I thought I had finally found a game my 3.5 year old could play and would keep her amused. I expected a bigger variety of games, but there are only 3 'challenges' on the CD. The box states there are three levels, but each level only increases the number of times you have to find a certain letter. So when my child found the letter X ten times in one game, the next level meant she had to find it 18 times. She got bored quickly as there wasn't much of a challenge and the scenery to each of the 3 games didn't change very much at all. It was fun the first time, but just became too repetitious after that."
2,Not really much of an adventure at all...,"Even though it is well beyond my age group and more suited for toddlers and the like, Elmo's Letter Adventure unfortunately lacks any sort of real content to keep your kids happy. The tasks are too simple and there's only three levels in all. It would have been wise for the programmers to have included more rewarding features for the kids instead of programming something just for sales. Let's hope Elmo's next Adventure offers more than just the letters."
1,"Take Mine, please.","I purchased this for my four year old to introduce her to gaming and maybe learn something in the process. She valiantly tried to like it, but the sluggish operation and boring premise were too much for her. My five and six year olds would not even touch it. Big disappointment. It has been gathering dust for a year. Buy a rugrats video- at least it is entertaining."
2,Look at mine,"This game is not good,according to my 4-year-old. He says it is boring and he should get some kind of reward at the end, like a parade, certificate, or party. But 3 levels? C'mon. They should give you at least 6 levels. 3 levels over and over has got to be boring. Where is it now? Gathering dust in it's case. Renting this game is good. My 4-year-old liked it for the first week. But caution- unless your kid loves this game, DO NOT BUY!!"
3,The usual thing,"I get so excited about books like this - where the parent and the child have so much fun together. Best of all, it's a DAD in this book - dads are so important.But we have so MANY books where the words are rhythmic - ""Vroomaloom Zoom - cackle lackle - splash dash wave crash"" - it just doesn't seem special anymore.Anyway, this is a fun sleepytime book about a girl and her daddy, with excellent illustrations"
3,Silly Noises to Make Your Child Smile,"If you have ever read to a child, you know how much they love silly stuff. The sillier, the better! The author puts his imagination to work, coming up with silly non-words to give the reader a pronunciation workout and the listener a laugh. Giggles are guaranteed. The illustrations are lovely, with note-quite-bold colors and broadly drawn scenes as a father takes his daughter on a nighttime ride to try to help her fall asleep."
2,A Little Over the Top,"This was seriously one of the stupidest book I have ever read. I understand the use of the different sounds and such, but they were done in a very poor manner. I think the book is a little extreme and has no real story to it.I wouldn't recommend this book. It seems like it does a lot of baby-talk and even as a baby, my parents didn't talk to me that way. I feel that by doing so, to some degree, you are insulting children's capacity and ability to learn."
3,Excellent--but dated,An excellent series (BBC. Jancis Robinson brings a certain wit & British charm to the whole subject. She has an amazing ability to stand outside of the wine hype and almost view it as an outsider. The only thing is this: this series has a 1995 copyright. And a lot has happened in 13 years!
3,Good but ....,"I was disappointed after watching the program for 5 hours; I was looking for something more about wine and wine making. It is a good start for someone who wants to know about wine, that's all. This is definitely not a course as what the title says."
1,"This is not a ""course"" as you might expect....","This video set is not necessarily a ""course"" about wine. This video compilation is more about Jancis Robinson crusading all over the world being seen with all these important vineyard owners. These videos are not for those who have moderate or less knowledge of wine and there seems to be nothing of substance for those who are trying to figure out why Chardonnay's, Cabernet's, etc...are the way they are. The information that is given is often vague and the dialogue is hard to follow. In the strictness sense, its a waste of money."
5,"Entertaining, Educational and Exhaustive",I recently starting studying for my WSET wine courses and have found these DVD's so useful. Packed with really useful information they are a great accompaniment to the book of the same name.I'd recommend them to anyone with an interest in wine.It would be nice if she brought out some more.
2,Caveat Emptor,"I checked this course out of my local library, and suggest you do the same. It is marginally about wine, and a lot about the effects of globalization on the wine industry. Interesting, but if you want more than cursory insights on taste, and wine making technique, keep looking.I am glad I watched it, make no mistake about that. Highlighting the differences between national winemaking styles alone is well worth the time. Interestingly though, I can't recall that it included discussion of the 1976 'Judgement of Paris' winetasting and its consequences.I found Jancis a bit annoying after awhile. The British have a well-honed ability to be condescending towards others, while having no native ability of their own. She has the unremarkable ability to drink wine. How that translated into something of celebrity status is a story of its own. None of it translates in actual ability to create good wine. Perhaps a little more humility on that lack would have reduced the gossip and catty comments."
1,And to top it all off.........................she's a dog.,"This woman is so overrated it's a sin. At a Wine Spectator event many years ago, she insisted the white wine being served was a White Burgundy and the bag of hot air even insisted on the region..............and then it was revealed to her it was a 1988 Chardonnay from Gristina Vineyards on Long Island. Oh well, it sure stinks to be a know it all.Not only is this not a course, it's such a pretentious piece of fluff I wanted to vomit."
4,parapper the rapper is afun game,"kick punch its all in the mind if you want to test this game im sure you'll find that the things it teaches ya will sure greet ya ,never the less you get a lesson of teaching!this game will blow your mind with grooves see the tight music of this action adventure!"
5,greatest game ever made,"In my own opinion.This is the GREATEST game ever made.Pick up the 2nd one also, it is also very good, or also UmJammer Lammy is a classic as well.Without this game we wouldn't have Dance Dance Revolution or any other games like that.Pick it up!"
4,Cool but the levels should be longer than 6,Cool but the levels should be longer than 6 like Um Jammer Lammy
4,Yea!,"Parappa is awesome! I'm surprised no one's reviewed this game yet.So it's not really much of a game, but it's so much fun. The raps get stuck in your head and you find yourself walking around saying ""kick, punch, turn and chop the door.. or I will fall to the floor"" It's hilarious.While it's much easier for people who have good hand-eye coordination and a good sense of rhythm, occasionally the icons on the screen that tell you when to click aren't accurate, so you do have to rely more on when it feels right. So if you're rhythmically helpless you will have lots of frustration with this game.The game's pretty short, but it's worth buying to watch the story and listen to the music, and it's fun to bring friends over and show it to them, even if it isn't a multi-player game."
4,AWESOME!,"I've never laughed so much playing a video game -- a totally unique and entertaining game! You must try it to believe, not your average game."
4,A one of a kind...,"This is an anomoly in my video game collection. Most of my games are either baseball, wrestling or boxing games. A few years ago though, myself and a bunch of my other drummer friends started playing this game as a means of practicing without going deaf. As in, do what parappa is supposed to do, but always change up the rhythms and see what works and what doesn't. Not only did our scores go through the roof, but it was an awfully fun way to waste a couple of hours a week. It's a great game, although it's short. Anyone can play it, almost anyone can beat it, and it hilarious even the 50th time through it. If sony is smart, they'll re-release this puppy (no pun intended) in a hurry. Better for them to ..."
1,"Good layout, keys too stiff","Echo most of what previous reviewers have said. This keyboard has a good layout, with the exception of the ""print screen"" row being flush with the keys directly below -- so I often hit ""print screen"" when I'm trying to hit another key. I like that the top-row numbers are in the right place -- the Microsoft keyboards consistently place the ""6"" on the left-hand side, which is not where touch typists like myself want to find it! However, I can only give this keyboard one star because the key action is far too stiff - the keys require too much pressure, and it's not healthy for my hands. I am prone to RSI and this keyboard just aggravated the situation. I'm going back to Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, even though I can't stand their keyboard layout."
5,nothing short of spectacular,"This book focuses on the Native American perspective of European colonization from early 14th century to the 19th century.It is detailed, well organized, the information is very thorough and completely cited. Casual readers will find the analysis fascinating and provocative. History students will find valuble insight and information related to the early Native American history. This book is extremely well written and the history is very well analyzed. The new perspective it provides gives the reader a much different view of the early developments of America. Excellent analysis."
3,"Informative, Yet Incomplete","Facing East is a refreshing take on early American history. Unfortunately, the book never lives up to its potential as it is rather hit or miss. The author will explore certain subjects, for example: ""the Powhatan Confederacy,"" in great detail, but almost completely ignore others such as the trail of tears. Furthermore, the book is almost completely devoid of information of native history in the southwest or in the great plains region. This would not be a problem if Dr. Richter clearly stated that his intent was to cover eastern North America during a certain time period, and then went on to explain why. As is, the author doesn't define any of this.Upon reaching the end of the book I was left wanting more, because the information that is presented is so informative and interesting, but also because there is so much that is lacking."
1,Damn.,"I have to completely agree with the ... review by ""punkk"". Listening to this CD made my bowels liquify and my eyes tear up. Everytime I hear this kind of [stuff] all I can think of is that time I saw a girl go into american eagle with an anarchy patch on her pants. Urge.. to... hurl... RISING!So yea. Don't buy this. Save your [money]. It may come in handy."
5,"AWESOME CD, IF U LIKE PUNK U NEED THIS","I got this cd after hearding NFG and Fenix Tx looking for some new bands that are like them. ONce I got it, I couldn't stop listening to it. It is a great cd that everyone should go out and buy. PLus, it is cheap, only 4.99, with a total of 23 tracks. Tjis is a rip off for drive thru, they could get so much more for it."
4,Controversial and amazing,"Written in 1993, this is the story of Professor Goodman, a 41 year old, married female with 2 grown children who finds herself unexpectedly pregnant. She opts, after much thought, to terminate the pregnancy, only to find herself arrested a month later and charged under a new law that retroactively makes abortion a capital offense. The book's cover says this could really happen which is impossible to believe but certainly may be possible. The outcome of the story is a surprize, but nothing like what I expected. The DA was a dummy, but her defense team, naturally, brilliant. The Judge should have been presiding over the OJ trial. Read it, it's very good."
1,"Technical maybe, but not expansive definitions",I found the product dissappointing. Definitions were short. Multiple interpretations and usage examples were not given. Equal or better on line dictionaries are available for free. See wordreference.com
3,ok,"I haven't used this dictionary much. It has a little homemade look about it when it arrives, so presentation could be a little better, but you can save it on your computer, so you don't need an internet connection at least. That's a plus for me. It seems to have quite a few terms but the presentation is poor."
4,Great for the Price,"Bought these as my hatch would not stay up anymore. They work well and were easy to install. Only complaint (and it must have been me!!) but I ended up ordering two of the same (two LEFT supports instead of one LEFT & one RIGHT). Instead of sending them back, I was very easily able to install both supports, thankfully! Well worth the money."
3,Europe by Eurorail,"For the first time Euro-traveler by rail, this book can take the guess work out of the train system in Europe. However, after spending a month in Europe, and with hindsight, I'm not sure this book has enough Useable information that warrants its cost.Many of the other euro-guide books will cover at least a small section on trains. Besides, there is not much to know about them in Europe other than where the train is located in the city you visit, and what time your train departs.This book did help discuss a few of the limitations of the trains and it did help a little with rail travel. It barely eeks out 3 out of 5 stars."
5,my puzzle can kick your puzzle's azz,"It's like tetris, but with punching. Of course, growing up in my house, tetris often did come with punching, and name calling, and the occasional thrown controller. Ah, the memories...where was I? This game combines the best elements of puzzles and fighting and puts you head to head against other players. The single player mode is fun, but the games truly shines when you're trying to beat a friend into bejewelled submission. combine like colored gems into power gems and strings and then use the breaker gem to shatter them all. your nemesis will then have a butt load of gems dropped on him that can't be broken for a set number of turn. your fighter will also perform an attack on the opposing character. the game is fast paced and can change drastically with only a few gems. I love it."
5,Cult Classic,"I've only met a few people that know this game but the few people I know love it. I actually had to buy a psone just to play this game since my ps2slim wouldnt play it but I don't regret it. It's fairly easy to learn and the way we play makes it so there's no one best person, different playing styles makes it so everyone beats another person sometimes. hard to master."
3,"As fun as I remember it, but how do I get it to look less pixelated on a big TV?","I loved this fun tetris-y puzzle fighter game in the early 2000's & I still like it, but I don't know how to make it look less pixelated on a 42"" TV. Any insight?"
5,"If you can get this game, IT IS WORTH IT.","Due to the rarity of SPFII, I decided to write this to contribute more ""I WANT THIS GAME NOW!"" fanaticism.This game is a very interesting single player challenge, even though the first two levels of easy mode are way too simple. Once the difficulty steps up, so does the skill of which you face off against. Even after you beat Hard mode, there is still one more level of difficulty to beat, which you must get going through the Puzzle mode. After you've thoroughly exhausted yourself with that, then the real fun begins. Invite friends over and challenge them. Within minutes, the entire house will be rocking. This game ranks as one of my top 10 video games ever played, and will continue to be in that ranking. BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
1,HORRIBLE JUNK,These idiots are so RETARTED it is not funny.For starters they're religious and all religious people are BRAINWASHED in their dogma beliefs.
5,Durable and Comfortable,I'm on my feet for about 6 hours a day and love these boots. I'm on my second pair and have been very happy with both.
2,Poor Value and since returned,"I wanted a timer to help me stop worrying about 'the clock' as I was trying to meditate. Thought this looked like a lovely option and was strangely willing to pay the price. When it arrived, though, the product was mostly plastic, weighed next to nothing and the wood veneer was water spotted and not pretty. The sound was okay and it worked as promised, but instead of worrying about the clock, I found myself feeling foolish for having spent so much on this item. I returned it (which I rarely do) and received my money back with no problem. I would NOT recommend it, especially since there is a free app for your phone that does the same thing and is MUCH more portable."
5,Much more than I bargained for!,"Mermer's book gave me much more than I bargained for! As a Professional Ski Instructor for Women's Clinics, I found her perspective on fear invaluable. Fear is real - it's not always rational, but it's real and we learn to deal with it. Males and females will both recognize themselves in this book. It was a big help to me not only as a teaching tool, but also in my personal skiing and most recently in a PSIA (Professional Ski Instructors of America) ski exam. Thanks to Mermer, I was relaxed and comfortable. Whether preparing to audition for a Broadway Play or to ski a steep, icy mogul field - this book helps."
3,Need a lot of elbow grease,This product did not soften the caulk very much. Took a lot of scrubbing and scoring with a knife as well
3,It Takes Awhile,This product requires a lot of time for the remover to be effective. It needs to soaked into the old caulk before you can start removing it.
5,It works ...,My shower needed to be re-caulked and I had already tried another product for a portion of the job. The other product worked but also required a lot of manual scraping to remove the silicone caulk. For the second part of the job I purchased the 3M caulk remover. The difference was significant between the two products. The first product required that the caulk be removed first then it would help remove what was left (sort of). The 3M product didn't require any pre-work just cover the caulk then wait at least 2 hours. I put the caulk remover on the silicone and left it overnight. In the morning I used my scraper and was surprised at how easily the majority of the silicone came right off. There was still a little residue left but nothing significant that wouldn't come off with a little scrapping. I wish I had started the project with the 3M remover! Note: my shower enclosure is ~3 years old so the silicone is not old.
3,Don't expect any miracles..,"Good: It does soften up hard caulk enough to make the job easier. But scraper is still required.Bad: The flip up dispenser nozzle is way too short, which makes it very difficult to apply. You will need a longer applicator to spread the stuff in corners. The consistency is too thin; it tends to run when applied on vertical surfaces. This product is also very expensive for what it is."
1,Does not work!,I applied this remover twice to the calk in my shower and it did nothing. I am still having to scrape it out. Did not work at all!
1,No magic bullet when comes to removing old caulking,I just tried it yesterday. A sharp knife and a putty knife will do the job. Don't expect to pull the chaulk by applying this product.
2,Not worth the mess,I thought this would make caulking a breeze. No way. Just got more messy as you go along. Did a better job with my finger. Scraper caulk remover piece of junk and the caulking softner remover was a waste of time. Removed old caulking better with a regular scraper.
2,Skin Care,I was taken off of this by my doctor before I could really determine if it worked or not. Sorry!
5,shoulder tees,I love these tees. they give me the exact height without having to think about it.One less thing to worry about!!
5,Wow,"This CD blew me away. It's so different than anything I've been listening to. The lyrics are thought provoking, and the music is great too. Who'd have thought a 2 minute track with no vocals (11) could be so interesting? It's like you're in some kind of trance. Anyone looking for something a little different should pick this up."
3,Decent... nothing great...,"The front of the disc said that Brazil's CD is a mixture of Yes and Sunny Day Real Estate. In reality, it's more of a mixture of 80's Rush and Green Day. The band references the former in their spare use of odd time signatures and bad keyboards, and the latter in their lack of virtuousity and the singer's voice.This is by no means a BAD album, but it's nothing that special either. If you're looking for some new prog you won't find it here. Check out Coheed and Cambria instead, they're far superior in just about every aspect from songwriting to instrumentation."
4,You will respect my authoriti,"I ordered this for a friend for Christmas, I hope I can part with it. Cartman features ""Mood Swing"" eyebrows and comes with Kitty, Alien Probe, and 3 sets of alternate arms. If you enjoy South Park you can't help but fall in love with this very accurate reproduction of one of its most famous characters."
4,A little too big,"The toy was a little too big for my collection, but hey it's South Park so what can I really say? 4 Stars!!"
2,Silly.,"The point of the double CD set is probably to get new fans of Oingo Boingo using another record company to get the money off of this release. Not a good idea considering the packaging isn't special and ALL of Oingo Boingo's Records are in print on CD. If you want a good Oingo Boingo collection of songs, get any of the other single CD collections and maybe the BOINGO CD (not BOI-NGO), if you like that, collect them all. I don't think Oingo Boingo has ever released a song on their albums that's worth missing. This collection is just too pricey for something you probably will buy again."
4,The Best of Boingo,"This item really makes a great gift to introduce people to power of Oingo Boingo. Danny Elfman has moved to many other amazing works, but there is something about the visionary drive and quirkiness of this early rock n roll mix that is seldom heard these days except in modern bands like Nightmare of the Elf. Think : Dada meets Nu Collapse meets The Phantom Limbs, the whole project launched by Richard Elfman! That's a powerful mix! Oingo Boingo began as a kind of cabaret, and if you want to imagine what rock and roll sounds like when it's on Salvador Dali, this is the album to check out!"
2,"Overpriced waste of time - still doesn't have ""Violent Love""?!","If you're a fan of Oingo Boingo, you already own OB's LP/CDs, this is ""complete anthology"" is an afterthought for completists - there are so many holes in this package, it's pointless - it might have been worth a fraction of the price IF they had seen fit to include the tracks from OB's long out of print original 10"" EP, featuring one of the best but often ignored songs, VIOLENT LOVE, not found on ANY CD yet - why why why? Oh well.Close, no cigar."
4,Great compilation - if you don't have any of their cd's,"Oingo Boingo is an exciting, fun band. This album is great to own if you are looking for a mix of their best songs. It has both studio recordings and great live stuff. The knock to the album is the lack of new material. There are no highly re-done songs that would make it a must have for a Boingo fan. So if you are looking to start a collection - get it, if you already have a collection - you're not missing anything!"
4,CanDo...a must-do!!,"Simply said, the most info in the least amount of space! My ONLY complaint is that for such a map, there is almost too much information (if such is possible). You must buy these maps to go with any book you have on the area, becasue the maps will be more current and point out things in a way the books can't. I have been to Cozumel three times, the Yucatan twice and now when I go, the Can Do maps are the only travel guide I carry. Get em...you wont be sorry!"
4,Great blues album!,"Great Dinah Washington recored this album in 1957. and while her voice (and personality!) was perfectly suited to material, her musicians somehow made music little bit too ironic.Eddie Chamblee who was a bandleader (and Mr.Washington nr.five!) probably decided to use instruments not as in original versions, but in some sort of mocking them, making some of the songs sounding like in burlesque, vaudeville theater.There are even some snare-rim drumms, which Bessie Smith NEVER used and which made this album hard to take seriously.Its a proof of Dinah Washington's genius that this tribute still have ageless beauty in spite of mocking music background.I love this CD more with every listening. (And her vesrion of ""After you've gone"" is better than original!) check the similar CD from LaVern Baker!"
2,Highly Flawed,"There is no doubt that Dinah Washington would be qualified to sing the songs made famous by Bessie Smith. After all, Washington knew plenty about hard living, drinking and the torture of loving the wrong kind of man. But this tribute album is highly flawed, mainly from the novelty arrangements. The instrumental tracks are arranged in such a way that should sound like they were recorded in the 1920's, but to my ears they come off as painfully hokey and frankly embaressing. I find no real fault in Washington's vocal performances, although a few are slightly mannered. She seems to feel these lyrics, especially on the live cuts, where she really cuts loose. I dislike this set for the same reason I dislike her popular albums like Unforgetable and What A Diff'rence a Day Makes. The instrumental backing simply does not do justice to the vocals."
2,Not their best.....,This disc has the feeling of being dashed off quickly. As if they needed an album to get out and tour with. I played this once and had to put it aside for awhile. I love this band but it hurt to listen to this repeatedly.
4,Good economy camera,"I read the reviews about the battery life so I bought some 2200mAh NiMH batteries and used one pair to take 100 pictures (half with flash), previewed the pictures, downloaded and erased the 128MB card I had and still has half battery power. Power crisis solved. By the way, all digital camera should use rechargeables. Buy more batteries than you need, you can use the rest for other purposes.Nice clear camera. Good bargain for a 3.3MP. No regrets."
3,Battery Eater,Only defect is the battery! put fresh batteries eat it within 10min. also the processing time actually takes quite awhile.
4,Excellent camera for the price,"This was my first digital camera and I'm not disappointed at all. A few great things about this camera are that it is a 3.3 Megapixel which means clear pictures, color LCD screen, it has an adjustable timer, shoots video in video mode, has an expandable card slot and all sorts of other bells and whistles. I haven't tried to print out any of the photos but they look excellent on my pc. It does eat up batteries but any camera with an LCD display does the exact same thing and the you can turn the LCD off to save battery life. If you go to Radio Shack you can buy a power adapter that can have any voltage tip put on it but I would still recommend buying some rechargeable batteries. Don't be scared just because it's not a brand name. It's an excellent camera for the price!"
2,For Neophytes Only,Can't complain about price. A little bulky. Definitely get rechargables and turn LCD off. Easy to use and has fairly good photo editing software. Flash leaves something to be desired. Not made for shooting at night or in low light. Red-eye issues when used in poorly lit room. But takes good quality photos in well lit situations.
2,SIPIX SC-3300 DIGITAL CAMERA,"The camera takes great pictures and is fairly easy to use once you print out the fifty six page manual. Which is ok, and not a hinderance. One does not have to print it out to use the camera.The camera is a little tough on batteries. I was told by a support staffer that you could not use rechargables but, on the spec sheet it says that nmh's are ok. i will give them a try. have only had the camera three days. My biggest dissapointment is that sipix does not supply an ac adapter. i was told to go to radio shack and get one. radio shack had a universial that worked but, the jack will not stay in place so it is worthless. so i am forced to buy a card reader to download on to my pc and spend, spend and spend on batteries. i will most likely return the camera ..."
1,"Nice Pics, Poor power consumption","Good pics, but this camera goes through batteries like they are a penny apiece! I put in fresh new alkaline batteries and downloaded some pictures and in less than 5 minutes, the batteries were D E A D!! The batteries in my old Olympus lasted through a whole day of shooting and downloading. Also, this camera gives no warning of the batteries running low, it just shuts off. Very frustrating when you are trying to get that crucial shot. This camera is good if you are taking snapshots at home, but lousy on extended outings due to the high power consumption. Be warned, the initial price is low, but you'll quickly make up the difference on battery purchases. Rechargeable batteries? Sure, but for the extra money, you might as well get a better camera that uses alkalines conservatively. PROS: Nice Pics CON: Sucky power consumption and poorly designed power switch. My advice: Spend a few more bucks and get a good name-brand camera."
2,You won't find an AC adapter,"It's a wonderful camera for which no AC adapter is made. And you will need the power of an AC adapter to download pictures. SiPix technical support says I should ask the firm that sold me the camera where I can get a 3-3.3V 2A AC adapter. ""We do not know of a specific brand or location on where to pick one up. We here at sipix do not make power adapters. If you can not locate a power adapter you may want to look into using a set of NI-MHsrechargeable batterys. These are great for digital cameras and you will not have to worry about the fuss of cords or having your camera plugged into the wall.""Spend an extra hundred dollars and get a digital camera that is supported."
2,DO NOT BE FOOLED,"After reading the other reviews, i thought this camera would be a steal at a 130 bucks. it is a steal-- the money the company stole from me for this piece of junk. First of all, it is HUGE compared to other digital cameras. The functions are extremely slow, and even when i put brand new batteries in, it keeps saying my batteries are dead or close to. Ive had the camera THREE DAYS. Ive used it ONCE to take a few pictures. I put a memory card in, and once i ejected it, it wouldnt go back in. it practicalyl chewed up my card and got stuck in the card slot. I'm extremely disappointed and wish I could get my money back. Stay away-- dont tell me i didnt warn you..."
2,battery eater,"I liked mostly everything about this camera except the fact that it ate through batteries like crazy! I changed the batteries 3 times during a 2 day trip. I wasn't even using the camera that much or leaving it on for very long periods of time (it automatically shuts off after a few minutes of not being used anyway). I also found that I couldn't see the LCD screen at all outdoors when it was sunny. I was also a little irritated that I had to print the manual out myself. I'm returning it in hopes of finding a camera that won't go through batteries so fast.But, I have to admit, I found the camera itself and the software it comes with very easy to use."
1,"Worthless, ... terrible battery life and software","Simply put, this camera is ... I should have known better than to purchase a no-name camera. I have been using digital cameras for about five years for work, so I know how one should work. The battery life on this camera is about 24 hours of taking shots (I only got 12). I can get almost two weeks from our Olympus at work. This is not, repeat not, with the generic included batteries but rather name brand digital designed batteries that I purchased beforehand. Two batteries is simply not enough for a digital camera. The included ""award winning software"" was probably only awarded by SiPix. Cumbersome on screen review of pictures by changing the buttons is archaic. You are better off buying lower pixel but name brand camera. Very disappointed. Don't waste your time and money."
4,Sipix sc3300,"This camera overall is brilliant, really clear pictures and brilliant features such as the cf card slot. It is really easy to load into my computer and came with grat software and the 3.3 MP makes it really good value. The only thing that stopped it getting five stars is it's battery life. I really do recommend that you buy rechargeable batteries for it and if you intend on taking it on a day out then do take a spare set. Apart from that the camera is great!"
1,Software is impossible to load!,"I have no idea how well this camera does or does not work because the software will not load on my computer!! I contacted the SiPix customer service several times and they keep routing me a different department, phone numer, etc... I have had this camera for several months and STILL cannot use it... and now it is too late to return it.... check, check, check, before you buy, or better yet, buy a different camera and save yourself some grief."
1,camera is ok!!..software [sucks!!!],"the camera is good,but the software is not compatible with some pc's.the manufacturer doesn;t send the right info.to download your pictures in your pc.i was very dissapointed and i don't recommend it unless they send you the right software!! watch out for this [product!!!]"
1,DOA! What else can I say?,"I made the stupid mistake of ordering this camera before checking the reviews. Although most reviews were about the batteries and power adapter problems, I was scared once I saw so many negative ones! I wanted to cancel but it was too late. The order had already been shipped. Well, I thought I would make the best of it until I received it and tried to turn it on. I called SiPix technical support. They answered the phone quickly and were very helpful but the camera was simply Dead On Arrival! I tried multiple sets & types of batteries as tech. support suggested but no success. The camera simply would not power on! I'm so glad though. I sent it back to Amazon and got an Olympus D-380 and am thoroughly pleased with it! All's well that ends well. :-)"
5,Let your little one feel like a big kid.,"This game is fantastic for a very young player. My daughter is 3 and she is able to play the game all by herself -- and win! It gives her confidence that she can play video games just like her older brother as well as reinforces what she is learning about numbers. I find a lot of video games that are rated ""E"" for everyone are still too hard and frustrating for a very young child. She has a lot of fun playing this game."
1,Disappointed,"This game is pretty slow and boring. My two year old couldn't get interested. I'm sorry to say this because usually Sesame Street does such a fabulous job, but not in this case. The game is slow and all you do is walk - very slowly - on a path looking for numbers. It is frustrating because you have to walk up to them in a certain way or you can't pick them up. Then there is no real ""reward"" to finding the numbers. Really boring."
1,Cute Initially but Not Challenging,"I got this game so that my toddler would have something to play on my Playstation. When he first received the game, he loved it (about a week); however, when he learned there were only 7 screens for play, he got bored (3 worlds with 2 adventures plus one that you go in each time you complete a journey). And, changing the levels (easy - hard) only changes the amount of numbers you must find but not the adventures. The only time he pulls it out (once a month, if that) is when I am not available to help him with another game. I feel I wasted my money. And, as another reviewer mentioned, it seems to use the same numbers over and over."
1,Out of Date,"This was the 5th edition of this book. While it was excellent for its time, it is now extremely out of date.The name of this book has been changed - it is now called ""J.K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 20XX"" (where XX is the current year), and the book is now published yearly, so you don't have to go by an ""edition"" number, which didn't really help the consumer to know he was buying the most current edition."
3,Not a typical Playboy DVD,"This is not your traditional Playboy DVD featuring video segments of Playmates. It is a historical biography of Hugh Hefner, and it also shows some of the events and ongoings at the Playboy mansion. What scenes it did have of Playmates, it looks like some scenes were taken from the Playmate Pajama Party DVD, but only small portions of it were borrowed.It is an interesting viewing into the life of Hugh Hefner, the man that all men in the world want to imitate, but I would recommend renting it first before considering to buy it."
4,Golf The Way It Should Be,"This book is better suited perhaps for the golf historian rather than just a fan. Within these pages is a warm and detailed history of the evolution of two vintage Donald Ross courses and resorts. It's all here, from their creation by those who created Pinehurst, through the fall from grace during the depression and war years, to the loving and careful nurturing back to greatness by two families, the Cosgroves and the Bells. It's about life (and golf) in a different era. It's about hard work. It's about love; love of family, the game, and the arena. It's about a place which still exists, a place where, for a short time, one can step back in time and truly appreciate what has transpired here. Mr. Pace has a deep affection for Pine Needles and Mid Pines, I believe. And if you read this book, and follow the tracks to the Sandhills, I think you will, too. This is one of my most treasured books."
1,Product ok,"By the time I paid shipping and handling charges, I could have bought the same thing locally for more than half the price and more quantity so I am not very happy but they work so will keep and learn lesson. Thought the shipping was free but guess not. Live and learn."
1,huh,this jack wasn't to my skills because it doesn't work nice inthe way that i wanted it to be and i am hoping they will refund my money back to me
2,The voice is not really clear...,"I order it for my grandma, and it is really cool, at least she knows what time is it almos all the time, except when it says 10 or 7, the recorded voice in the watch is not really clear, other than that, serves the purpose and for prize it's O.K."
2,save your money,I was disappointed. The story became quite predictable. The acting was wooden at best. I am sorry to have such a negative reaction. I really hoped to like it. The Broken Harvest made no sense to me.
4,Not the All Clad you know,"It works and clean up was easy as it's non-stick. The press is very heavy due to being a cast iron. Though its Chinese made, tt seems very sturdy. It made nice grill marks.Usage:PaniniBrauts/Saugages"
2,Not the best All-Clad,"I got this pan for free b/c I bought so much All-Clad. I love the rest of it, but this pan has brought me nothing but trouble. I do agree the sides are a little short. I also think it is awkward to hold and move around. Also, it says non-stick, but if you keep reading it says you need to use a little oil. Frankly, I think they give it away for a reason."
3,Not For Certain Cooktops,"I asked for, and received the All-Clad Panini Pan with Press as a gift. I was so excited and couldn't wait to use it; however, bad news arrived before I ever got the chance - while reading the Instructions I found that it is not recommended for flat top stoves. Since I have a flat glass cooktop, I decided to call All-Clad to find out why it is not recommended and they told me it is because of the way the pan and press are constructed, the heat will not distribute evenly and I would not get good results - and they definitely recommended against using the pan. Just want to pass this along in case you are considering - I'm returning mine . . . unused."
5,Necessary,"Bought two. One for beach house so always have it around for a quick sandwich. Easy to use, easy to clean"
4,Affordable AC Adapter Replacement,"I found this to be a solid replacement adapter for my aging Dell Inspiron 5100; works great to charge the battery. However, as other reviewers have noted, the fit is not a snug as I would have liked."
4,awesome,"My laptop cord was so old that it eventually severed. I called many places to get a price estimate, but they seemed so expensive. This company was resonable and shipped it to me in a timely manner."
2,frustrating solution,"I was in need of a new adapter after the new puppy got a hold of the original one. Dell was selling theirs for a lot more, so I decided to give this one a go.I'm now disappointed because it does not seem to fit my inspiron 4150 properly. It will work fine for a few minutes, then the cord gets moved the slightest bit...and my comp shuts off! This is really frustrating since I usually use my laptop on the bed and like to change positions every once and a while. Now I have to set it still and hope me getting off the bed won't jilt it too much.If you're looking for anything slightly mobile, get another adapter."
5,An AC Adapter that actually works,"This was my third order of an AC adapter. The first two were the incorrect voltage, even though both said they were compatable with my Dell Inspiron 8200. This one actually works.My orginal cord broke right where it attached to the computer, and this one seems to be better reinforced. I understand this is a common problem with Dell laptop cords. This $60 replacement works well, better than the slightly cheaper ones I tried first, and without the $200 cost of replacing it straight from Dell."
3,Adapter Review,This adapter works reasonably well but is not a snug fit into the laptop and keeps falling out.
2,Dell power supply,"The product arrived in a timely fashion. I was very disappointed with the product, however. The plug-in that goes into the computer was not a snug fit. I have to wiggle it around to get a connection, and when connected it is likely to disconnect if you move the computer much. The power supply that originaly came with my Dell still fits snugly. Sorry, but I'm not at all impressed with this product."
3,AC adapter,"Plug doesn't fit all that well into the laptop, I have to keep pushing it in to keep AC power. The AC power cord that plugs into the wall is very thick and makes everything quite bulky when packing it up. Seems fine otherwise."
1,Only worked for a month,This cable did not make a tight connection with my laptop and stopped charging it after one month. I had to get another one.
3,"Well, he's no Jesse Brown Wolf . . .","If you like the basic premise of this book (i.e., vulnerable young woman on the run from abusive ex-husband is rescued by mysterious stranger who walks the city streets at night, haunted by his past and being a good guy in spite of himself), go for the original: The Night Remembers, by Kathleen Eagle. In MBMB I was actually more touched by Seth's relationship with his sister than by his interactions with Molly. The brother-sister relationship wins this book its third star.FYI: I have heard that Night Falls Like Silk, Eagle's sequel, is nowhere near as good as The Night Remembers. So if you read Night Falls Like Silk and disliked it, don't let it scare you off from The Night Remembers."
4,A Delightful Read!!!,"Myrna MAcKenzie has writen a wonderfully romantic, delightfully poignant story with Morning Beauty, Midnight Beast.On her way home, Molly slips and falls, going into early labor. Seth finds her and rushes her to the hospital. He can't help but continue to care and protect her. Molly for her part wants to repay him for his help. The two fight their attraction for each other because both are running from things in their past. Can they overcome their pasts to build a relationship? You will need to read the story to find out. I am sure you will not be disappointed."
2,Sloppy and Unfocused,"Just a terrible album from Montell. When is this guy gonna stop fronting as some kind of player and just stick to what he does best--ballads. Montell's an incredible songwriter for other singers like Sisqo, Deborah Cox etc. but he just never seems to get it done for himself. He needs more songs like the ones off the Rush Hour and Nutty Professor Soundtracks. Lessen the freak songs and take more than a month to put it together (which is what it sounds like to me) and only then will we finally have a complete album from somebody as talented as him."
3,IT'S ALRIGHT,After his Let's Ride album which i felt was his best album of his career .. how he comes back after that one.. Well he is back but this time the results are not as strong as the latter mentioned .. the problem? we have heard it before borrow a riff there.. take something from another song.. however this album does have some good moments the moments come on these tracksGet it on toniteCant Get EnoughTime to say Goodbyethe rest of songs really dont go anywhere .. a very forgettable remake of Phil Collins' Against all odds .. Check out Mariah Carey's remake of this song far much better
2,"MONTELL FELL OFF AFTER "" GET IT ON TONIGHT ""!",I consider the rest of the CD more or less filler material. The song GET IT ON TONIGHT is has best - ever!
3,"This one is in the league of ""This is how we do it""","This album was one of those albums where the first song is misleading to buy the album. Get it on...tonite is a hit like ""This is how..."" but this album is better than that one. I applaud his attempt at originality with TRACK 17 but he shouldn't have split the slow and up-tempo and he should have put the Get it on...tonite remix instead of the last song. Now not like the other reviewers who love and adore everything he comes out with, I am honest. I have 5 of the 6 albums but I am going to tell the truth. This is better than ""this is how..."" but nowhere near ""Let's Ride"" & ""More to Tell""."
1,bad music except for 1 song,I have and have heard a LOT of albums and this one really is crap. All the songs are pretty much the same and the difference between the first half and the second half (separated by the artist)...well there is no difference. He was trying to have have club music the first half and bedroom music the second half.
1,Another KARAOKE remake!,"The biggest problem with hip-hop and such is that they take a song 20+ years old and add new words to try to make it their own. This title cut doesn't do it! The original is much better! (Claudja Barry's ""Love for the sake of love"" from 1977! ) For chrissakes if you are gonna steal a song at least REMIX it a little!"
2,I was so disappointed!,"When I heard Montell was droppng a new cd I was ecstatic, until I bought it. The only good song was track #2-Tonight. The rest sounds just like all the other junk that's out now. What happened to the Montell who wrote, produced, and arranged More(MJ's second cd)? His second and third cd's were so much better than this. Purchase at your own risk!"
3,Nice release,"I am by no means a Montell Jordan fan, but this CD is kinda tight. The single ""Get it on Tonite"" is the bomb, and most of the uptempo tracks are tight. I'm not even a Jordan fan and I enjoyed this album, so I know diehards will love it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"What happened to the Montell I used to know.. and love? This CD lacked EVERYTHING his other albums were full of... vocal ability, good production, and decent writing. Everything is overtly sexual, and the only decent song is ""Get it On.. Tonite"", so don't use the single to decide you want this album! The other tracks sound like they may have been written in a week, and the features are weak. Don't waste your time.. or your money! I would be more inclined to go back and buy ""More"" or ""Let's Ride""."
5,GREAT,"I've never heard a better R & B Album before. I never heard a better voice before. I never had feelings like that by listening to music before. I love this album. And I love this voice. The feelings he's expressing, no one is able to express than himself! His groove is like his voice and although I knew just 2 songs before buying this album, I love it more than anything else I've ever bought!! I'm from Austria that's why I had to search more than half a year for music by Montell Jordan. And that's why my English is not as good as yours!"
5,I love it!,"I am fan of Nespresso. I own their espresso maker and love it. I personally drink only black espresso myself, but for those of my friends and family that like some frothed milk action, this is the gadget. Previously, I had a handheld frother, but the disadvantage of this was that the froth was usually not heated. This machine froths and heats and impresses everyone! It is also supremely easy to clean. I recommend it!"
2,"Would love it, if it worked!","I was very excited about getting this frother. I thought, it was pricy, but I LOVE frothed hot milk! Two days later - frother does not work for the second time. I tried it several times this morning, and nothing worked. It gets hot, but the disc does not spin, and it makes this unusually loud rattling noise. I'm really disappointed, but considering the price, I am definitely going to take it back to Williams. Maybe they can give me some advice, but I can't image doing anything wrong. I guess, I'll try one of the hand held frothers... Too bad, because I really loved everything about it (well, except the price...) I would like to note, that it heated the milk to the perfect temperature, and I only had trouble with it, when using the Latte setting."
1,Not Great,"At first glance, this seems to be an awesome milk frother. Makes just enough for one cup of coffee, hot in under a minute, and doesn't make a sound!! EXCEPT that after about two months, it stops getting hot enough, it starts burning the milk at the bottom, becomes difficult to clean, and doesn't stay on for the full amount of time that it is supposed to. And this is the second one I have boughten. I would not suggest buying this milk frother."
3,for a teeny cup of coffee,The idea of a frother that both warmed the milk and frothed it seemed very desirable when my battery operated wand frother died. However I discovered that this frother was created for those teensy espresso cups of coffee. It was not made for the healthy mug I consume ever morning. You would have to spend several sessions with this device to get adequate foam milk for your normal to large cup of coffee. I ended up returning the nespresso aeroccino for a rechargeable wand frother.
2,"For three lattes, it was great.......","As with a couple of other reviewers, I was thrilled with this machine when I first bought it, 10 days ago. But after about three perfect lattes, the frother stopped working. I suppose some milk might have dripped on to the bottom, but if so, not much. So I trotted back to Chef Central and got another one. This time--fresh out of the box--no froth at all. So what now? I love my Nespresso D90, and I like the looks of this machine and the hot milk, so I may try a third round (the store must have 200 of them stacked up and ready to sell). Needless to say, though, my confidence in this product has plummeted."
2,Faulty Product,"Unfortunately product was faulty. However, must congratulate vendor Ace Photo Digital for prompt refund of price and postage on return."
1,Nespresso Aeroccino Automatic Milk Frother,"I purchased the nespresso aeroccino automatic milk frother in March of this year, 2010. It worked GREAT for all of four months. Since I purchased it inside the US and I live outside of the US, it is difficult to mail back to have repaired. All in all, if and when it works it IS great, but it is a major problem as it constantly breaks. It simply is not worth the problem of paying a fairly high price for a troublesome product."
1,"Good concept, poor reliability","This is a clever device, and quite simple mechanically. Thus, it is very disappointing that there has been so much difficulty with these devices after such a short time. I had the similar experience of power failure after about 13 months of use. Customer service was friendly, but wouldn't do anything for me because it is out of it's short warranty period of 1yr. They did offer me half price on a new one, but I'm staying away. Hopefully, Nespresso can get their reliability up a bit on these machines in the future."
1,Another dissatisfied customer,"Unfortunately I have to share the pain of other people here who thought this to be a fantastic machine at start, but were very disappointed after 2 weeks. The aeroccino just stops working, the milk stays cold, it will not run for a full cycle, it's too small for even 1 cup of coffee so you have to do 2 rounds and it spills very easily. I even called to complain and got a new replacement, which was good again for 2 weeks, but after that showed the same exact symptoms.Don't buy this product, you are guaranteed to be disappointed."
2,"Like others, loved it, but it stopped working!","My husband and I purchased this when we got our Nespresso (LOVE the Nespresso!) and it worked very well for a while. It was difficult to clean as the milk sometimes scalded to the bottom of the container. There is no real way to get it fully clean without getting it a little wet! I always made sure it was fully dry before using it again, though. The other day, it just... stopped. No heat, no froth. It was a little small, too, for us American latte-lovers, but I would have been fine with it if it had just kept working! The concept is great -- the easiest foam I've ever made, even with skim milk -- so there is reason to buy. But, watch out!"
1,Works only a few times and dies.....,"Saw this in Williams Sonoma and thought it was great. My husband got me one for Christmas. It is now February, and the third one now has just broken down. When i returned the first one, the WS ladies were shocked. When the 2nd one died, they made me feel like it was me - this has never happened before, WS only buys the best products, yada yada, and now 3 times is the charm. I just went on Amazon and read all about everyone's experience, and I am printing out all the reviews, majority of which say the thing dies and how everyone is their 3/4/5th one..... so when they are shocked today when i bring it back i can show they they are full of crap. These should be recalled and reintroduced into the market when they figure out why they don't work after a while."
3,This product is the BOMB!!,What a great gadget this is however like a bomb it leaves a mess. No matter which blade I use or what level of milk I put into the machine I turn my back to get my espresso and bam - milk all down the side of the pitcher. I am so very disappointed because it is so simple to use and so easy to clean and very fast but the mess of the milk all over the counter is annoying. I have used it half a dozen times and I am sorry to say it's going back! Not worth 100.00 if it cannot hold any milk? I measured at the lowest level in the container - 1/4 cup is the lowest level of milk and still overflowing! What kind of drink can you make with that? A shame because I really like the concept. Exasperating
3,"when it works, it's great!","The milk frother is really good...BUT, I am now on my third one. For some reason, it just stops working. I treat it well, never immerse it in water, or do anything wrong as far as I can tell. Each time it stopped working, the company replaced it without a hassle. Will they continue to do this? I suggest that they recognize there's a problem and fix it. This is a great frother when it works!"
1,It's not so good,The problem of this product is that the mill frother stop if the milk is hot. So you need to wait to the aeroccino become cold.
1,Nespresso Aeroccino is unreliable,"Our first Nespresso and Aeroccino were purchased in the USA (Florida) 2008, 4 years ago. We spent a total of 18 months in the USA during these years and our Aeroccino just stopped working!According to the lady on the Nespresso Club line it was one of the early machines, so do NOT buy a used Aeroccino. The newer models may be more reliable because the ones that we have in Asia have (crossed fingers) are still working."
1,Two of them have died mysterious deaths,"Completely unreliable product. The first one I got worked fine for about two weeks, then mysteriously ceased functioning entirely. You press the button, it whisks for a minute, but no frothing. They replaced it, and then the second one did the exact same thing except it died after two uses, not two weeks. Complete waste of time and effort if a product is going to be this unreliable."
4,Wife loves it. I like the service,"3 months after getting it, it stopped powering on. I did a chat with a rep from Nespresso and had a new replacement on the way in less than 5 minutes. I'm guessing they have a problem since his first response was, ""is it not powering on?"" but they are making it right with absolutely no aggravation and no fees."
3,Great WHEN it works,Altho it froths fantastically it breaks down easily. We are on our second one which broke within 9 months; the first one may have lasted 9 months or a little longer. I'm looking for another company which makes a milk frother.
1,Limiting and unreliable,"This product was a major disappointment.First of all, as others have mentioned, the device's capacity is frustratingly small. If you're trying to make a latte, for example, you'll probably want to run it twice -- very annoying.But worse is that the temperature is unreliable. Two-thirds of the times that I used it, the temp was okay -- not as hot as I'd like, but in the ballpark. But the other third of the time, it was NOT hot milk. What good is that?!Finally, for no apparent reason, on some uses, the magnetic paddle didn't seem to stir the milk properly, and it left a burnt-milk scum on the bottom of the device, as though you were heating milk on a stovetop and forgot to stir it.Find another frothing solution!"
2,good frother but breaks easily,"this is a great frother, fast and makes perfect foam but it has what seems to be a major design flaw, we have now had (and broken) 2 and both suffered from the same issues. As soon as some water accidentally gets into the inside (from the small holes underneath) while cleaning then you need to get your credit card out and buy a new one. as much as I love this machine and its ease of uses - I am buying something different this time."
4,Perfect froth!,"I love this device. I actually have a $2400 installed coffee/espresso machine, but I have to clean it out every time I serve cappucino or milk-based products. This appliance allows me to have a cappucino and not worry about cleaning my coffee machine. It's a little hard to clean, though, since you can't get the bottom wet and sometimes the frothed milk hardens a bit on the bottom and requires some scrubbing. Still its very fast and the froth is great. I use organic 1% milk and it does a great job."
3,"An idea: why not just say ""not for skim"" - how about that?","This is for the Aeroccino PLUS, which is apparently a newer (post-2008?) model.I mean, works fine (only had it for a few weeks, so I don't know about the reviews of others), and I bought it on the [...] website. I don't know about other vendors but I call the attention of potential buyers to the caveat in the booklet, but not on the SurLaTable site: ""NOT FOR SKIM"".And, indeed, it does >>not<< froth skim, or at least just a quarter or third as much as whole or 2% (complete surprise to me, if not to others). But it heats just fine. However, I have a stovetop, microwave, oven, broiler, grill, blowtorch, paint removal gun, engine block and fireplace which can do that.Christopher GrayNYC"
2,"Don't buy this older model, but Definitely buy the new Aeroccino PLUS","This original model is unreliable, hard to clean, doesn't make rich froth, and dies unexpectedly, among other problems. However, see my review of the new Plus model, which I gave an enthusiastic 5 rating. I gave this older model a 2 rather than a 1 because at least it did produce some froth easily, at least while it was working."
1,Great idea bad product,Haha I thought I was alone. I too gone through 3 replacement of this machine and they all suddenly stopped working. The new model and the blade problem. Funny you call customer service and they pretend they never heard about it or are unaware of chronic problem with this product!I thought perhaps there was something wrong with my electrical outlet! Great customer service though with Nespresso but this product should never been on the market. All positive reviews here are people who are about to discover it won't work one of these mornings for no apparent reason.
1,Too Tempermental,"This product requires way too much TLC for the price. If you have more than one memeber of your household wanting to use it, you have to wait until it cools back down. It doesn't make the milk hot enough or in a big enough quantity. In this economy, it is just too expensive and requires too much patience. Not worth the price, not even close."
4,My fingers are still crossed,"I've had this frother for 3 years and after a shakey start it has not missed working after a problematic beginning.As most others have mentioned, keep the bottom dry and never set it in the sink or turn it over after rincing the unit.A dishwasher cleaning would be certain death.I've used both skimmed milk and whole milk and it's always perfect.There really is no excuse for releasing a product with such a problematic design. Are you listening Nespresso?Update November 13, 2011 It died. Just a little past it's second birthday."
2,"Unreliable, expensive and does not heat milk sufficiently","I purchased an Aeroccino but found it less than easy to clean without scratching it, slightly unreliable, and too small to cater for more than 2 cups at a time. In addition it did not really heat the milk adequately when taken directly from the fridge. Eventually it stopped working and I had to return it.After looking at the reviews for Aeroccinos on Amazon, it seemed that many others had experienced similar problems. One reviewer recommended the Froth Au Lait, which prompted me to purchase one to give it a try.I have been very happy with the Froth Au Lait and in my opinion it is unrivalled in quality and price anywhere. It heats the milk perfectly directly from the fridge and the froth is amazing.I have since purchased another UK (230V) model, and shipped it to England since there is nothing to rival it in the UK market.My opinion: save your money, and take a chance on the Froth Au Lait. You won't be disappointed."
1,works great until it doesn't work at all,"I have had my nespresso coffee machine for two years and I love it. I decided to purchase the Aeroccino a few months ago. This product is a wonderful concept and worked great for about two weeks. I have had one replaced after two weeks and now the second one has suddenly stopped working. I had read that the machine should be unplugged immediately after use. I did this while using the second unit, but it has stopped working as well. I would not buy this product. This item is pricey and I expected it to at least last a year!!"
1,ink spots,The poor quality of the original recording shows what progress has been made in the music industry.
4,Very good CD but ---,The sound on this CD has been cleaned up and is more polished than some of the remastered originals. I enjoy listening to it but I still prefer the uncleaned up versions - warts and all. Old recordings are OLD RECORDINGS and that is part of their charm. I listen and enjoy but not as often as I do with the original copies.I would still recommend it to friends.
3,It Started Here,"To me, the Ink Spots were the beginning of modern music--the seeds of rock & roll and all that followed. Some of the songs here are classics and should be in any collection. Some of these songs are not the best; but hey, it's another 20th Centry Masters collection, and should be considered as such.Their trademark guitar lick introductions get a little tiresome when heard one after another, but how can you fault them for their trademark sound that worked in its day? I would guess that in a collection of music featuring various artists, I would appreciate this music a little more, as their sound would be in contrast to others, not running from one tune to another. Having issued such criticism, it is only fair to also state that there really are some musical gems in this collection."
4,Ink Spots,"I purchased this CD as a gift for my son. He's a real music buff, likes just about all music. He has become an enthusiast of music from the '40's and requested an Ink Spots CD for Christmas. He says he is really enjoying this CD."
3,Hang on!,"I agree, this Tamagotchi is very good. But, you must remember this is just a mini version, and it's not meant to be as good as the normal Tamagotchis. It's meant to just be a keychain that you can check on once in a while.If you are busy, but still want a Tamagotchi, I would recomend this one."
1,mini tamas suck!,"When my friend got a mini tamagotchi, I wanted to play with it so bad. When I asked her where all of the games were, she said that there aren`t any. All you can do is check what time it is, care for it when its sick, and clean up its poop. You can`t even name it!! Overall I HATE this toy. dont waste your money it buy the regular sized one because it is much more fun."
1,NOT interesting!,"I have a V2 tama and a V1 tama. This mini tama is soooo boring. It doesn't even have games or a gender! You can only feed it, clean after it and give it medicine! You can't even connect with other tamas! This tamagotchi sucks, BAD!"
1,overall crap,"clean up poop, feed it, give medicine, time.no games, names nothing intresting about it. not to mention it never changes after it dies..every time its the same character. ive used it perfectly time and time again and it seemed to me it just dies after about 2 weeks for no apparent reason. i even once left it with up to 6 poops the whole day and it still fell asleep and finally died like a day and a half later. wont be using it again!!! NOT RECOMENDED..unless you collect."
4,A very fine personal take on the subject,"Clearly the author, both a Jew and an Architect, has presented his take on a rather complex area. Similar works have been written that have differing subject buildings. One from France, by D. Jurasse for Adam Biro has quite a bit more of French Synagogues including those of Provence and perhaps some better photography for some entries.There are areas that I would rather have seen discussed in a bit more detail in either of these works, including Synagogues of the New World outside of the United States (Caribbean, South American, Canadian). Most of these works may not be major architectural feats, but do stand to some degree of scrutiny in addressing local cultural idioms in perhaps the best ways that the creators could achieve, given the local resources. At least a brief summary of these might have been nice."
4,you need the CD,"Carr provides a quick course in designing and making an antenna. The text starts off simply, with basic information about wave propagation and explaining such terminology like decibels and coaxial cable.Then the book describes each of the main types of antennas - Yagi, Marconi, Hertzian and others. Each is covered only briefly. But accompanied by simple circuit diagrams and illustrations. These should suffice to let you build them. Be aware that there are much large, more comprehensive texts on antenna design. Aimed usually at antenna engineers. Carr's book can be readily comprehended by an amateur in this field.The CD is useful, because it has a lot more background information, delegated to it by the text."
1,Wrong Book to Buy,"..the information is useful, but it makes much moresense to buy the author's Practical Antenna Handbookwhich contains much more useful information... if you buy this one, you pay the same price foronly 1/3 the information....."
2,Antenna Book,Book just had basic information; definitely not worth the cost. The disc that came with it did not work. Big time ripoff.
4,eBags TSA-accepted 4-Dial Combo Lock (2pk) (Red),"Attractive, well made, sturdy looking lock. However it does not insert very far into the locked position, only 3/32"". This might be a vulnerability.Mark"
5,Great little lock,I love these locks. Easy instructions to set the combination & the color is great!
2,Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song,"Was a decent read, but covered a lot of ground covered elsewhere. The meanings of the songs were more the author's interpretation, and it is questionable as to whether or not this is really the message the song was meant to convey. Okay, but not worth twelve bucks."
2,Not to be taken too seriously,"Sure Kurt's songs were great and beautiful, but everyone knows that his lyrics are somewhat crytic, sometimes seeming like just nonsense. This book makes an attempt to explain the songs, but don't take it too seriously. Kurt is often quoted for thinking it's funny when people would try and analize his songs. He says that often they are just lines from poetry books of his, and he didn't even realize what he was writing at the time. There are some songs here that have a definate inspiration and solid meaning, but others were just pretty much made up as he went along. Go ahead and buy it if you have some cash to blow and want some outsider insites on the meaning of his songs."
4,Almost excellent.,This book is a great one. My only quarrel is that they failed to mention the b-sides and unreleased tunes. But for the most part all the songs from the main albums are here and are very informative. A must for all Nirvana fans.
3,true,"any true nirvana fan doesnt need this book becuase i personally understand exactly what kurt is saying and surely dont need a book to tell me!but do to the fact that i collect nirvana stuff i have it, and have not read it though!"
3,I love Kurt forever,"I don't own the book because I don't think that a mere author of a book can tell me what Kurt was thinking or feeling when he wrote these songs. I know in my heart what Kurt was thinking and feeling. I love him. I probably will buy the book just because I collect everything Nirvana. So, if you're a true Nirvana fan -buy it but have your own interpretation."
4,"Great book, lots of history and vintage photos.","This book is a nice coffee table book about H-D racing from 1934 to 1986. The author gives a great objective look at H-D's racing successes and failures and pulls no punches when discusses the advantages and disadvantages (and the reasons why) H-D had over the competitors. A great history book of flat track and road racing, not just for Harley lovers, with tons of great old pictures."
5,What A FIXX,"This CD takes me back, I can't get enough. I always will need a FIXX like this. Thanks for putting such a fine group of hits together. It is THE ULTIMATE FIXX !!!!!!!"
4,good tune not for the meek,You must have an ear for new wave pop to get a good feel for this album.This music never wimps out.All original....
1,"Senco 3C0001N RoofPro 450 3/4"" to 1-3/4"" Coil Roofing Nailer","1 Did not like the gun because had to hammer ever other nail in.2 bent at lease one nail from ever coil out of ten, have to stop working unhook the air hose and use a 16 penny nail to push the nail driver back up in the gun.i called senco thay sad the gun is not for everday use i can see why.and i only used it for ten coils (120 nails per coil)"
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS GUN,"I purchased this gun from a local home depot. I noticed right away this gun was not working right. I have used may nail guns before and this as bad as it gets. It was bending nails over, breaking nail heads off and misfiring. I returned it to home depot and picked out a Bostich."
3,Base Solo Bass,"Dave Holland is one of the great modern jazz bass players. As a contributor to Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew,"" Chick Corea's early 70s trio and group Circle, and Joe Lovano's recent ""Trio Fascination,"" he has been a part of some jazz's all-time best albums. Even a few of his own recordings, the magnificent ""Conference for the Birds"" and his two duet albums with Sam Rivers, are easily among the best avant-garde jazz recordings in history. Unfortunately, ""Emerald Tears"" does not match these other efforts. It is a tribute to Holland from his label ECM that they would even give him the opportunity to make a recording of solo bass music. And while some of the tracks create a deep, rich texture and evocative mood, the album overall is rather thin and redundant."
5,A great guide to weekly ceremonies and meditations!,"Although my training is in a different American Indian tradition, this book ... and the author's guidance, has been very educational and helpful as I pursue my spiritual path. IMHO, the exercises (ceremonies and meditations) are useful to anyone with an open mind. And, especially, if you want a different perspective on life."
5,Better than a guidbook - and easier to carry!,"I don't think I'd go to a new vacation city without the MapEasy Guidemap. I've used them in Seattle, San Fran and now San Diego. They've helped me find interesting places to visit, tasty food and even parking!"
4,"In depth, well researched and of invaluable assistance.",A well researched book that reads more like a university thesis. Offers a brief synopsis of Forman's films (up to and including 'Amadeus' -1984) and critical analysis. Of invaluable assistance to students studying Czech cinema or any of Forman's films.
3,Old School but AWESOME!,"This is an AWESOME game!! The graphics of course are old, this was from back in the day! But the concept is cool! A little repetitive but you also have to go through mazes and solve puzzles! I enjoyed it alot!!"
4,I bought this game expecting the best,"I got it and realized it was the worst game I have ever played. As far as I could see there was really no storyline. The viewpoint in this game is awful, you see through the eyes of the person, much like Doom. There's no world map or anything. I played for like 5 hours and got nowhere. There's no battle screen, you just slash things a couple times and they die (this is all done on the main screen. The graphics are comparable to Wolfenstein 3-d (they're garbage) And the music is bad too. This game is only an RPG to those who consider horrible shooting games RPG's, for the serious gamer, this game is a joke. Oh yeah and the voice over at the beginning is real bad"
3,not bad,"It's just typical. That's the word of the day, it seems. Typical. Too many similar games available these days. This means you really don't need to bother with most of them, and unfortunately, this is just another game you can skip over if you wish.While the storyline is good, what you mainly do in Kings Field is walk around with a sword finding items hidden in treasure chests and... no, it's not Zelda. It mine as well be, though. Nah, it's not really a rip-off. I don't know what it's supposed to be, but I think the game was a bit too heavy on finding important items. It needed more action."
1,disingenuous title,The title of this book should be Victorian Cottage Life.Only 1/3 of this book actually shows cottages. The rest is interiors with romanticized presentations of the inhabitants and biography's of the artists.The author claims that most of the cottages still exist. It would have been interesting to have current photos next to the paintings tohave then/now representations.Overall it is NOT a good representation of Victorian cottages.
5,Excellent reading,"I was very impressed with ""Through Footless Halls of Air"", and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about history. Despite the fact that Canadians feature prominently in the book, I believe that people from other countries could also benefit from reading it. My compliments to the author."
4,Must Have,I bought this scanner cor my business and in my opionion it is a must have. Setting up plu was a cinch with it since I did not have to type in all of the codes and checking out the customers has been expedited!
2,ROYAL MACHINES PS700 HAND HELD BAR CODE SCANNER,I AM SORRY TO REPORT THAT AS MENTIONED IN THE SPECIFICATIONS IT DOES NOT SCAN FROM A DISTANCE OF ONE INCH OR EVEN 1/2 INCH. MAY BE I GOT THE DEFECTIVE OR REPAIRED PIECE.
5,A book that gets real.,"This book should be required reading for every Christian, but certainly for male Christians. Many men have the same difficulties relating to the historical portrayals of Jesus that Yancey did. He rubs off the Hollywood, takes off the dress, gets rid of the sheep under each arm, and describes a Jewish man, not at home with the religious elite, but ministering to people like you and me."
4,Good Companion to The C++ Primer,"I wanted to do all the exercises in the C++ Primer, and it bothered me to not have answers. This book helped, the explanations accompanying the source code were important."
5,Review By Robert Reid,I found this book very interesting and enjoyable. It is a little slow to start but becomes quite exciting and suspenseful. Realy a great book once you get into it. It is non stop action and I found myself hardly able to put it down. It was a treat to find a book with no swearing in it. Also has numerous references to God. It has a moral of what faith can do.
2,"""Murder on the Titanic"" could have been better","James Walker's ""Murder on the Titanic"" has an intriguing plot and enough historical accuracy to keep things interesting, but Broadman & Holman (his publishers) did him a disservice by editing the book poorly. There are misspelled and misused words, adjectives repeated too frequently and some very wooden sections in the dialogue. All of these things detract from the story and, for me, spoiled the enjoyment of the book. I kept thinking, ""I wish someone had read this over more carefully before it was printed!"" It also seemed like a whole chapter must have been cut near the end of the story, as it jumps from hitting the iceberg to the frantic search for lifeboats without any reference to that critical period on the Titanic when most of the passengers didn't believe she would sink. Although there is much that is good about the story and its message of faith, I wouldn't recommend this one to my mystery-reading friends."
1,I was very disappointed in this book.,"The author's research,if any,left something to be desired. He captured the details of the structure of Titanic rather well. His details of his characters on the other hand were rather confusing, giving a physical description of a character in one chapter and then completely changing it in a following chapter. Also his main character, Morgan, seemed not to remember people at all. Moments before the ship hits the iceberg he has a physical confrontation with a passenger. Later as the ship is sinking he again has a physical confrontation with the same passenger and he does not know who he is or even remembers confronting him before. Also every Titanic buff knows that the Astors boarded the ship at Cherbourg and not Southhampton."
2,"Ok mystery, week on Titanic Facts+","This book presents a good mystery and some feeling about what it must have been like to travel on the great ship. However, it does present a number of technical inaccuracies. Examples of such include: who got on the ship when and ""historical"" passengers who are not on any of the various crew and passenger lists that I have consulted (although these passengers have shown-up in other works of fiction). Also the suggestion that leaving the water tight doors open might lead to the ship staying afloat longer, while recently popular, has been shown through computer simulations to be erroneous."
3,"Interesting setting, mediocre story","I was interested in reading this book because I am interested in the Titanic, and for that element the story was entertaining enough. However, the plot itself is not very interesting or suspenseful; characters are one-dimensional, the political motif is far-fetched, and the romance that weaves itself through the ""mystery"" is formulaic, predictable, and not very convincing for the times. I think it's worth a read for the purposes of light diversion, but it's nothing memorable."
4,An engaging mystery,"I enjoy a good mystery, and this book provides one, with the back drop of a fascinating world event. The characters seemed real, and had to deal with life-threatening problems throughout the book. I got involved in the lives of the people on board the ship. Folks who like mysteries and/or the Titanic should enjoy this book."
1,not quite,"pity it looks hell of the lot cooler here, than this product really is. Oh and its not fitting on real grownup head. Too small, you see. So if you got head that leans toward large sizes - look for somewhere else..Did i mention that material is pretty horrible? There you go. Piece of cheap bike jersey wrapped around head will feel about same. I'd stick with cotton next time."
1,Disappointing map of Eritrea,"I bought the ITM Map of Eritrea hoping to get a detailed, up-to-date, and carefully drawn map of that interesting country in East Africa. I know Eritrea fairly well from several visits, careful study of their history, and friendship linking. But alas, this map is inaccurate, it contains few details, and the factual information inserted in the map is difficult to read. The map also contains a historical account of Eritrea. I find the narrative dubious in many regards. For instance, it is claimed that 'Arabs' developed the kingdom of Aksum by the third century, while historians now believe that the Axumite culture may well have originated in Africa. No mention is made of the interesting connection between Egypt and Punt (believed by many to be Eritrea) in the third and second millennium BC. To sum up: a very disappointing map - qualifying for one star in my evaluation."
1,"So good, then so bad",This was an amazingly good slow cooker... until the insert randomly cracked while in use. We thought with the All Clad name and reputation and the fact that its a $200 slow cooker they might do something about it. Nope. Its so disappointing because it worked so well and we thought it would last a long time. A long time being more than a year or two. But it didn't. Would not recommend spending the money on something that won't last.
1,MASSIVE FAIL,"This is the worst product I've ever bought. Period.This poor excuse for an All-Clad product just quit working after 3 uses. It sounds like it is a bad relay inside the unit, but i am not about to take it apart to find out. The first time I used it the ceramic insert cracked. I coughed up another 50 bucks to buy another insert to replace it, and now this. Totally worthless slow cooker. Avoid like the plague.All in all, a massive FAIL on the part of All-Clad."
1,Just awful,"What I hadn't figured out before I bought this thing was that it involved all the preparation of any meal, but I'd have to do it the night before, when I was tired and just returned from work, so what did I gain?When the thing conked out after 15 months, I didn't bother trying to retrieve my warranty money, I just tossed it in the trash and wrote the whole thing off as a bad experience. Crummy product, to fail after so short a time and definitely not any sort of time saver. If you want a crock pot, I'd suggest buying the cheapest out there, since this hugely expensive one is no better."
1,The REPLACEMENT was also defective!,"I am here searching Amazon reviews for a new slow cooker after our 6.5-quart All-Clad 99009 died tonight and ruined our dinner. The electical unit simply stopped working after less than two years.This is the SECOND electrical unit to fail. We had our first All-Clad for about two months when it failed and was replaced by All-Clad (a process that took many weeks).Oh yeah, we also have hairline cracks in the crock.Do not buy. Caveat emptor."
1,Horrible slow cooker - NOT worth the price,"I was extremely excited when I bought this slow cooker about a year ago. I love All Clad products, but this has been the worst item I've purchased from this brand. The ""LOW"" was very hot and it dried out anything I cooked. I even burned 2 pot roasts before I gave up. On top of that issue, the ceremic insert broke on me 3 times. Now, I am very careful with the inserts and have owned 3 crock pots/slow cookers before this one and have never broken one. I didn't use it on top of the stove out of the base - which was their first question. I replaced the insert 3 times and then returned the whole thing to the store where I bought it. I didn't buy mine from Amazon. I bought a Cuisinart one for $100 less and so far I totally love it. I'm reviewing that one next I'm sure. I wish I had read more reviews on this All Clad model before I trusted their name and paid so much for it. WAY TOO MUCH TROUBLE!"
1,Poor manufacturing quality,"Used the product for over a year before it failed. The problem appears to be cheap, poor quality manufacturing in the heating element. I live near the All-Clad facility in Canonsburg, PA, so I regret saying that outsourcing to China requires a great deal of effort to maintain quality control, which effort isn't shown in this product."
1,Not the real deal,"This is a knock off All-Clad product. The real deal has a nonstick aluminum insert that goes from stove top (gas or electric) to crock-pot to table and can even be used on it's own. The one sold here has a ceramic insert and is an inferior product, as far as All-Clad quality goes."
1,Poor quality and poorer customer service at All- Clad,I have owned my slow cooker for about 2 years and it just went out with expensive meat inside which I had to toss. The consumer line at All Clad didn't care. I would not purchase again. If you look on their website you'll see their supposed to be superior quality. Do not believe it.When it worked it was great but a product this price shouldnt fail so soon.
1,Dangerous Unit- BEWARE,"BOUGHT FIRST UNIT IT DID NOT WORK AT ALL. REPLACEMENT UNIT UPON 3RD USE BEGAN TO SMOKE AND WIRES BEGAN TO BURN, 3RD UNIT AFTER 4 USES ALSO BEGAN TO BURN.THANK GOD WE WERE HOME, IF WE HAD LEFT IT ON AS MANY DO, OUR HOUSE COULD OF BURNED DOWN.I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO CPSC ALSO.PLEASE BEWARE !"
2,Cover for All-Clad,"Was cooking Short-Ribs on low for 6 hours and 3 hours into cooking heard crack, ENTIRE LID had shattered ruining $50 of meat"
2,What a Crock!,The all clad pot lasted for about five years. The electronics are shot (won't heat). Was happy with it until now. Can't get any replacement parts for repair. Am stuck with the show cooker. Sure would like to repair it instead of throwing into the trash. What a waste! Hope it is made in the USA. Need better quality. Should not fry itself after only five years of light use. Buyer beware!!!
5,So far - so good,Have been using it a year now - the one thing I do notice is that it must work hotter than other slow cookers in recipes. Sometimes I have it on the least amount of time given in the recipe and the food is overcooked. I let it cool and then I put the insert in the dishwasher.I have used it 3 or 4 times so far and it worked really well. I am very careful with the ceramic piece after I read the other reviews. I rinse it out and then put it in the dishwasher. It looks nice sitting on the counter so fingers crossed
1,Most disappointing,"I wish I could rate this product 0 stars. I've had this slow cooker for about a year and used it quite a few times for a variety of recipes. From the very first use the machine has exuded a peculiar rubbery smell and I believe I can even taste it in the food. I thought I was imagining it until I started reading reviews of the product online. My ceramic insert hasn't cracked (yet), but with all the tales here about its failure I'm now afraid to use the unit while I am out of the house. Moreover, the ceramic is impossible to get fully clean--there's a chalky discoloration on the interior that cannot be removed--and the plastic surface on the readout screen cracked in several places after one use. What garbage. I got the thing as a gift and am about to dump it and get one that really does what it is supposed to do--make food that tastes and smells good."
2,Burned Out Heating Element!,"We've been fine with the All Clad model for two years. It's used mostly in Fall and Winter, probably a few dozen uses in all. Yesterday the heating element 'cooked'! Lights and LED display are lit but no heat. Very disappointing for the putative top of the line cooker."
3,Not Worth The Money - Use Your Oven,"I had electronics issues with a Hamilton Beach programmable slow cooker so I decided to take it back and get the top of the line slow cooker. This All-Clad was on everybody's ""Best Of"" lists, so I got a discount on a display model at Bed Bath & Beyond and ended up paying $150. For three or four months I used it constantly for chicken, oatmeal, ribs, beef, fish and even chocolate chip cookies. It worked great, but even though I was incredibly careful cleaning it (did I mention I paid $150?) soon I noticed cracks forming on the ceramic insert. I did some research and found others had the same issue and they were out of luck. I tried my favorite oatmeal recipe in a souffle dish in the oven at 190 (the slow cooker's ""low"" temperature), and it turned out just as good as in the slow cooker, so I took the All-Clad back. I'll just use the oven from now on."
2,Careful while washing!,"I loved my slow cooker until the day the insert broke. I was washing the insert in the sink, it slipped and tapped the sink at an angle and proceeded to shatter in my hands. Normally my clumsiness would have just annoyed me, but it was amazing how little pressure it took to shatter the entire insert. And to top it off, to this day, I have been unable to find a replacement for sale anywhere. It's really disappointing."
1,Don't buy the name,This is a poor product. The ceramic insert cracked after 8 careful uses. The temperature setting run very hot meaning you must adjust your cooking times and regularly check on what is cooking (which is not really the point of a slow cooker).For the money it is a very disappointing product which is a surprise for All-Clad. My suggestion is to look else-ware.
4,Works Well,"I have so far used mine a handful of times and it has worked well. I like the timer presets, i was finding on my old crock pot that was just on/off i was drying meals out on long work days. All Clad always makes nice products!"
1,Should be NO STARS,"I only cook in All Clad pots and pans and LOVE them. Super quality, beautiful to look at and made in America. I was given an this Crock pot as a gift. When I pulled it out last time to cook in it, it was covered with ""spider-like"" lines, inside and out. The ceramic surface of the crock was crazed and covered with what looked like mold. I cleaned it with chlorine, soap and water and then put it in the oven, and heated the crock to 200 degrees to sterilize it. To my surprize, the ""spider-webs"" were back in less than 10 minutes, inside and out. Something is seriously wrong with this product. It wasn't mold, but something leaching out of the crock through the crazes in the surface! DON'T buy this product, I've thrown the crock away and will never buy anything cermaic made in China again. Come on All Clad makers, I am willing to pay for quality, but I want quality not crap. I am very disappointed. Anybody know a place I can get a replacement crock that ISN'T made in China?"
1,broken after 6 uses,"may be a fluke, but this expensive crockpot broke after six uses...it's been three months and I'm still waiting for a replacement from the manufacturer..."
2,cracked insert x 2!! great while it lasted,"I loved the slow cooker... until the ceramic insert cracked! I was hearing little popping noises and didn't know what it was. Then I realized that the the insert had cracks! All Clad wanted the original receipt to replace it, so we took it back to bed bath and beyond and they exchanged it. The second time we just out right returned it. The cracks all happened within 3 months of use with no extreme temperature change William sonomas is recommending that we try the more expensive one with the heat-responsive cast-aluminum insert that functions as a cookware in itself (can go on the stove top)... a hundred dollars more!! but may consider it since it got really much better reviews. Btw, WS told us that many are reporting the same cracked issue with the ceramic insert and everyone has been thrilled with the heat-responsive cast-aluminum insert one... go figure..."
1,Made in China,Have owned this product longer then warranty period. Has had hairline cracks which have gotten worse over time. Contacted All-Clad this morning. Was told the ceramic bowls are not made like they use to be because no lead in the manufacturing process. My original crockpot from Betty Crocker days still works and cost under $20.00 dollars. This one cost $219.00. After being on hold for eternity the warranty person gave me a toll free number for some part company in Conneticut. The nice lady explained the replacement insert was $49.00 and back ordered until May ? All-Clad better take a close look at their product design and where its coming from. I have been a huge fan of All--Clad for years and have many products. However I will not be buying any electric appliances made in china with All-Clad's fancy name printed on the box. Buyer beware....
1,"Wow, complete fail...","I received this All-Clad slow cooker for my wedding back in late 2008. I put it on my registry thinking that ""Hey, it's All-Clad, it should be rock solid!"" HOLY COW was I wrong!!! I've used this unit only FOUR times since I received this as a gift, and the fifth time I go to use it this morning, it's completely dead... While it worked, it was perfect, but I expected to get many more then just four meals out of this... It's in PERFECT condition, not a scratch, and I've stored it inside the house with a towel over it so it doesn't even get dusty! Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed with this product. Shame on you All-Clad for charging so much money for this product, and especially for not making it right after obviously producing such crap..."
1,"Cracked Insert, Lousey Customer Service","I spent a small fortune on this All-Clad Slower Cooker from Williams-Sonoma - $250. The ceramic insert was treated with great care yet cracked within 6 months of infrequent use. Customer service was atrocious. The insert is not available BUT I was told that I could buy the new version with the metal insert. REALLY!? Although the cooker was not my first All-Clad purchase, it certainly was my last. I bought an inexpensive Hamilton Beach that is not pretty but works. Fool me once...."
1,Beware - Beautiful and Faulty,"We were thrilled with this product during the five times it worked. Then the electronics failed. Not what you would expect from All Clad, the looks or the price. Look for something else."
1,Never again All-Clad,"Performs as advertised as long as the pot lasts, which wasn't long for us.All-Clad's company policies prevented us from getting a replacement.Bad company all-together, my advice would be to look elsewhere."
1,stops cooking,"All our slow cooker model is older approx 3 years old), we have found that it no longer cooks at an even temperature. After contacting All Clad, they inform us that this model is no longer made and there are no replacement parts. They offered to send me a new one at a cost of $130. For such and expensive cooker, we feel like this model should have lasted longer.I SENT THIS BACK TO CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH A NOTE DETAILING MY DISMAY. THEY PROMPTLY SENT IT BACK TO ME MINUS A NOTE OR EXPLANATION AND ONE OF THE 'LEGS' WAS MISSING . TALK ABOUT POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. FOR SUCH A STEEP PRICE, IT IS A DUD.I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A CHEAP CROCK POT THAT WORKS GREAT."
1,The insert broke after 10 uses!,"The All-Clad slow-cooker did a great job for the first 10-12 recipes. Then I noticed a small crack running along the side of the insert. It doesn't look like it goes through the entire thickness of the insert, but from the other postings I'm reading on this product page, it's probably going to get worse and eventually lead to a permeable crack. I just imagine having the insert filled with a big soupy recipe for an overnight slow-cook, and the broth draining through the crack into the electric base while I'm asleep. Definitely not worth risking -- I'm looking for a new slow-cooker to replace this."
2,2x Cracked,"We purchased this from Williams & Sonoma and the first one cracked all the way through, as in, it leaked. So we put it in the box an brought it back to the store. They graciously gave us a brand new one which proceeded to crack on the second or third use. That's unacceptable. We've had Rival crock pots that last for years, but we thought we'd step it up with an All Clad. Couldn't have made a worse decision. We are going to demand that All-Clad gives us the aluminum insert for our troubles, but if (when) that doesn't fly, it looks like we'll be taking the step back down to Rival."
3,Superseded -- buy one with cast aluminum liner instead for stovetop!,"This is an older product. All-Clad recently came out with a new one with a liner of cast aluminum, not ceramic. The liner is intended for separate use on stovetop or in oven before or after use in the slow cooker. A great idea: brown your meat or vegetables first on the stove, cook in the slow cooker, then cover with a topping and put briefly under the broiler before returning to the slow cooker to keep warm during serving -- all in just one pan!!!As of today, the new version is available at Williams Sonoma for the same price Amazon is currently charging for this older version, though prices at either place may change... (keep an eye out in case the new one with the metal liner becomes available on Amazon!!)"
1,Poor quality...Go with Hamilton Beach - Better Value,"Slow cooker broke after 8 uses - electronics went dark. For $200, you expect much more.After several uses, I recommend Hamilton Beach Set 'n Forget Probe Slow Cooker. Hamilton is 25% of the price of the All-Clad. It is lighter weight (the All-Clad is a beast). It is smaller without giving up much interior cooking space. Hamilton Beach has more programmable options and has built in thermometer."
4,Lives up to the reviews,"All the reviews say this is the best large slow cooker. I'm a believer. l tried the Calphalon 7 qt. and I really wanted it to work, but it cooked way to hot. The All-Clad has done a beautiful job. It is worth the price and the only reason it doesn't get five stars - there's no cookbook. Better Homes and Gardens ""Cook once - Eat Twice"" is a life saver. Go buy it and save yourself time in the kitchen."
2,Worked great until .........,I have had my All-Clad slow cooker for four years and it has worked great. I am really careful about never putting in frozen foods and always let it cool before washing the insert. Yesterday I heard a loud snap while it was cooking and didn't think much of it until I served our soup and discovered the insert has a crack all the way across the bottom and up one of the sides. I'm so disappointed! After reading all the reviews about cracked liners I won't get a replacement so - - I'm on the search for another cooker. The first one I had in the early 70's lasted 17 years and I'm wondering if it was made in America?? :)P.S. When you're reading all the reviews please note the date written. You will find most of the older reviews praising the slow cooker and then more recent ones will tell you the real story of how inferior the liner has become. Save your money.
1,Don't Buy this!,"Being an All-clad fan for their pots and pans for years, I decided to buy this slow cooker for my wife 3 years ago. It has worked fine up till today. The curcuit board stopped working - similar to other posts for this item. Called Williams-Sonoma, they say call All-Clad. We called All-Clad, and were told it's out of warranty and we will have to pay for all repairs ourselves. So being a DIYer, I started to take it apart and figured if I just replace the curcuit board, all will be well. What an absolute piece of crap this thing is. Very thin gauge stamped metal pieces held together with the tiniest of screws. I decided it's not worth the 60 or 70 dollars it would be for a new curcuit board. It is now in the trash where it belongs.We are no longer All-Clad fans."
3,Most expensive is not always the best.,"I just started cooking with a slow cooker and was so pleased with the convenience of leaving for work in the morning and coming home to a cooked meal. Unfortunately I went for top of the line. My mistake as there isn't that much difference between All Clad and the slow cookers that have similar features. Save your money, it doesn't do anything different. When looking for a crock pot also think about the size, I found the 6.5 quart slow cooker to be very heavy and awkward when trying to wash it/rinse it out. Disappointing with All Clad was the lid cover. It becomes so hot you can't pick it up without grabbing a pot holder. My old slow cooker's (the one that started it all -$25) lid I could always pick up during the cooking process without burning my fingers. And lastly I too was disappointed that All Clad didn't include a slow cooker cookbook, it has a couple of recipes with their instructions, nothing too interesting."
1,"If it breaks, you have to throw it away","I was thrilled to receive this cooker as a gift eighteen months ago. I used it a lot, and was very happy. But when I plugged it in last week, the screen filled with 8s and it wouldn't turn on. The warranty is for only one year, so we went local to repair it. No luck - All-Clad doesn't supply parts. So we called All-Clad and were told that they don't do repairs. They told us to buy a new one.So it's a great cooker until it stops working. I think we'll use the ceramic insert as a planter."
1,so disappointed,"Purchased this item thinking it was the best product. I have probably used it 25 times in 3 years. Today, the display portion quit working. I am stunned to think I spent that much money and it gave out and there is no warranty. I will never buy All-Clad products again. My next email is to Melinda Lee, where I got the original review from."
4,great for easy meals,"my mother gave me this cooker and its really great. I have been using it a lot- you just put in the ingredients in the morning, turn it and dinner is ready at the end of the day. I recommend it."
2,Easy repair,"After just a few uses my ceramic liner cracked and started to leak. Do to fact my warranty was up, All Clad refused to replace the liner. A replacement liner cost $49.99 plus shipping. After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided not to invest any more money in this cooker. I had a tube of high temp epoxy glue that I had purchased at ace hardware for another project. I sanded the crack on the outside of the liner and applied a thin coat of epoxy over the crack. I place a sheet of aluminum foil on the outside of the liner before I insert it and I use reynolds slow cooker liners on the inside of the liner. The cooker works great and I have had no further problems with leaks. I learned to always turn the cooker completely off before I unplug it. When I plug the cooker in, I do not touch the controls until the clock appears. Most people who have had their electronics go out on this cooker have unplugged it prior to turning the unit off."
1,Ceramic Insert is Garbage,"I have had this slow-cooker for a couple of years. It's a nice cooker, but the insert is too fragile to take a chance on buying it and actually using it. While I was washing it in the sink, it slipped about an inch and hit the edge of the sink. This is evidently enough force to crack the handle and some of the side off. The replacement insert is about $70! So look at the price of the cooker and the insert replacement and then decide for yourself if you want to cook with and wash something that breaks so easily. Ridiculous."
2,"Great, But....","Loved this thing for the first year. No problem with performance. However, and this is the deal breaker, the ceramic insert cracked. Like a lot of others I've been disappointed by the lack of help from All-Clad. Unfortunately, the cast aluminum replacement insert requires a different cover which makes the solution almost as expensive as a new cooker. My advice would be to avoid this product and opt for the model that includes the metal insert if your heart is set on All-Clad."
1,Don't buy,I've had this for several years so it is out of warranty. I have only used it a few times and it has quit working. Obviously not reliable.
1,Cracked Ceramic Liner,"My wife purchased this item in August, 2008 and during that time we used it roughly 4 or 5x a year. Recently I used the croc pot for making Irish stew. Later while cleaning the ceramic liner I felt a rough surface on the bottom and upon examination I noticed a hairline crack running across the bottom. Prior to the crack in the ceramic liner the croc pine worked fine."
1,50 50 odds,"The reviews are mixed on this one, so I checked Williams-Sonoma, same thing there. Only 37 of 92 W-S customers would recommend this cooker. That's NOT good, I wanted to buy, but I think not."
1,Faulty electronics,I purchased this slow cooker despite the negative reviews. After 2 weeks (and my second use) the electronics failed. I returned it and will not purchase another one unless the model is redesigned. It did cook wonderfully while it lasted!
1,Won't last,"We received this as a wedding present and used it less than 10 times.We came home last weekend to cold pot roast.The slow cooker has died, and we are unable to revive it.I'm considering replacing it with theCrockpot SCVT650-PS 6-1/2-Quart Programmable Touch Screen Slow Cooker, Stainless, or I may just forget programmable circuitry and get theHamilton Beach #33162H 6QT Stainless Steel Oval Slow Cooker. I know I won't buy another expensive All-Clad P.O.S."
4,Aluminum insert version,"After reading other reviews, I opted for the aluminum insert version of this product, which is a Williams Sonoma exclusive. I've never owned a slow cooker before so don't have anything to compare this to, but it's wonderful so far. Because it's aluminum, I can saute in the inner bowl right on the stove without having to wash another pan. I'm a vegetarian and often add frozen products towards the end of the cooking time (Morningstar Farms veg. steak strips, etc.), and don't have to worry about the temperature change cracking the pan. Clean up is a breeze. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price - $250 is pretty steep, and with shipping and taxes from WS, the total price was closer to $300."
1,I returned it.,I returned this product because it was way too large and looked out of place on my countertop. Also the cooking vessel was too large as well. I felt I would have to be in the restaurant business and cook for a crowd to be able to utilize this slow cooker.
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I purchased this and it was one of my favorite kitchen items ever...until the SIXTH use when it stopped working. It is an electrical problem. SIX USES. Obviously, I do not recommend that anyone purchase this overpriced garbage."
4,one of the best fighter games,"This game is awesome fun. It takes you through missions in the jungle against drug runners, Russia in the winter, in the dessert. Lots of differnt sceneios are a lot of fun."
2,No Top Gun,"If you are looking for a great game for air-to-air or air-to-ground combat action, keep looking. (Try Ace Combat 2.) This game is really weak. The only two positive things that I can say about it is that (1) there's a ""no crash"" option which allows my four-year-old to play it with little difficulty, and (2) ...umm (I'll get back to you on two.)"
5,"Thank you, Myles Coverdale....","I make no pretense of being a music critic, but I must say that this collection of the psalms sung in the Anglican tradition is wonderfully uplifting. Myles Coverdale's beautiful translation of the psalter is used as, I believe, it is used in the Anglican Book of Worship. I don't think that anyone who reveres good, classical ecclesiastic music will be disappointed in this collection. Well, somebody will be, but...whatever..."
2,Lop-sided account of a divorce,"The author uses the bitter divorce of two people in theright-to-die movement to make an argument that voluntaryeuthanasia is unacceptable to society. Only one sideof the story is told, and there are numerous inaccuracies."
4,A good shooter for the Playstation,"G. Darius is a side scrolling 1 or 2 player shooter in the tradition of Gradius and R-Type. It uses polygons to form the characters and backrounds, and features an innovative new power up system that allows you to capture your enemies and use them as helpers. The great thing about the capture feature is that you can capture almost any enemy...even mini-bosses! G. Darius is of decent length and also has multiple paths so you don't have to play through the same levels each time, adding variety and replay value. There are a few factors which hinder it from perfection, though...like the drab colors in some areas, flat textures on some enemies, and occasional slowdown. Other than that, I believe G. Darius is a worthy addition to any shooting game fan's library."
2,Not Worth It ! ! !,I have this game and it is pretty good shooter game but doesn't have any action. The words are blurry so you can't see the text. It has good graphics but the gameplay lacks action and it doesn't hook you on to it to keep you playing it. The weapons are pretty cool but overall the game is worth 2 stars. :)
2,Thin material,"I liked this costume for my little one because she is always making animal sounds, and the cow is one that she likes :) The costume is cute, but the material is really thin, and the tail is heavy and so it seems that it will ultimately tear off the costume. I don't think it is worth the cost."
4,This book has it all!,"Jennifer Marsh is asked by an eccentric society matron to chronicle what she says are her last days. She thinks someone is going to kill her. On Jennifer's first night in the spooky (and some say haunted) house, she hears screams and is locked in her room. When she frees herself, she finds the old lady's bloodsoaked and empty bed. Who killed Mary?This was a very fast moving and interesting mystery. It has romance, ghosts both historical and recent, family drama, and a great murder mystery. This is Fitzwater's best book so far."
3,Survival/Horror/Puzzle-Solving,"At the time that Silent Hill first came out, it was like the best game ever at that time. Then soon comes out Echo Night. Sort of on the same premise, evil lurks around each corner. Figure out the clues, the puzzles and just hope you make it out alive. But in Echo Night....it's in a FPS view!!!! Cool!!!! But unfortunately the graphics were not up to par. That's the only thing I really didn't like. Now the sound FX were interesting and to turn to find that noise and to see a spirit right there behind you......wow!!!! I enjoyed the game back then but gave it 3 stars for the poor graphics. So if you liked Silent Hill, you might enjoy this. Just keep in mind the graphics were....not good."
3,"if you have a normal attention span, this may not be for you","echo night is about as exciting as horrible animation and impossible puzzles can get. the beginning will put you to sleep, and if you can find out what the hell you have to do in the house in under 30 minutes, well, you get a cookie. the ghost ship is haunted by one of the scariest looking little girls ive seen in a game, which makes you love to hate her. the best part of this game is the flashbacks. to help a ghost escape the ship you go back to their time and fix their pasts. after the first 4 or 5, they get rather hard, and you will pine for one just to get off the ship. the boat also could have been larger and more complex. its easy to memorize, and you loose the sense of adventure quickly. its fun to rent, but a waste of money to buy."
2,Not for your average gamer!,"I made the mistake of buying this game. I beat it in less than one hour, and was greatly disappointed with the overall story & puzzles. The interaction with the spirits was fine, but there was no challenge to the puzzles. After the first few minutes, you will start to wish the boat would just do a Titanic & sink! Please, buy a good game like Kings Field if you want a challenge."
5,Add this Book to your library!,"Having read the Doyle's book, ""Routing TCP/IP"", at least three times over, I was pleasantly surprised to find new insightful concepts and perspectives on the various IP routing protocols in Rudenko's work. Rudenko displays a mastery over the subject matter and offers unique scenarios and examples to illustrate the main points. This 'black book' is more comprehensive than most cisco press books on similar topics, and I would highly recommend this book as an excellent companion to Doyle's book or just by itself!"
1,Not thrilled with this one,This book is a tough read. The author uses 100 words to explain something that could be done in 25. It takes a simple subject and makes it too complicated to understand. The target audience is advanced users that want in depth information. Not what I would expect from the Little Black Book series. I would stick with Cisco Press on IP routing.
2,The Whole is Less Than the Sum of its Parts,"There are some fine songs on this, and yes, there is a thematic thread of being broken hearted in the lyrics, but the mix of material, artists, and styles just does not hold together -- ranging from hard R&B, to 60's Motown, to slickly produced 70's music that was the precursor to disco. If you are after soul music, most other compilations are better."
5,Scoobariffic!!!,My 4 year old loves The Scooby Doo movie and when I saw this item on sale I bought it and the Thelma doll.It looks good and has held up to her playing with it.My only complaint is that the shoes are way to big and fall off(but how many children keep up w/Barbie shoes anyway?).Over all I think that this doll is an excellent buy.
3,Shaggy Broke the first week,It's good because he's posable but my two year old ripped his legs apart way to easily
5,What more could you possibly ask for?,"I just got this item delivered today. So yes, I've only used it for one day but so far, my review is as follows: It came very, very quickly. It was brand new in the box as stated. The unit is of great build quality and blows COLD air. For the reviewers who say it doesn't work and so on, it's possible they got a defective model but I'd say for the most part these people are not very intelligent. In a while I might be back if the thing breaks, but as of right now, this thing works beautifully. Quiet, cold, sturdy. For the money you can't ask for more. Oh yeah, and this is the SAME EXACT unit Sears sells for 369 but you have to pay tax and shipping on sears. This is an Amcor unit, New Air just rebadges it. Here's the link to the same unit Sears has: http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_04210000000PI'm picky about electronics and I don't usually buy cheaper off brand stuff but this one kicks butt and I have ZERO complaints. Thanks!"
4,1st portable AC unit,"This was my first purchase of a portable AC unit. We are in a rental and I liked the idea of not having to bother to get permission to install a fixed window unit. We've used it now a few times and it seems to work fine. It is fairly quiet and cools the room. The window venting was less trouble than I thought it would be, although, if you move it from one window to another different sized window you may have to get out the tools to resize the vent frame to fit the new window properly. It is fairly easy to move around the house. This was a good choice for us... I do wish it was a bit more powerful... but would feel the same about a fixed unit of the same BTU and price."
2,"This thing is loud, Loud, LOUD!","I, personally, could never use it in a living area. It's very loud on high fan and it's very loud on low fan. Fortunately, I have an Amcor ALD12000 that is very quiet, that's in my shed, that I can swap out for this one. It will probably be fine in my shed, but I could never get used to that much noise in my house.My Amcor, incidentally, has a quick disconnect for the exhaust hose and this one doesn't and my Amcor came with a nice through-the-wall kit and this one doesn't.I haven't even used this air conditioner yet, so I hope I don't find anything else I don't like about it."
4,Compact Portable AC,"This is a 12000 btu portable ac unit. It was easy to set up and use and produced a good amount of cool air. However if you need a portable ac in an upstairs room,keeping in mind that warm air rises, you should probably get a 2 hose model. Single hose models take air from the room to cool the unit. That air has to be replaced from somewhere so I found that the unit seemed to be working against itself."
1,disappointed,"i looked through many portable ac units and decided to go with this unit based on its great reviews. i must have received a defected unit because a lot seems wrong with it. first of all the air that comes out of it is hardly cool at all! its not a good sign when i'm sweating while sitting in front of the ac. seems like i just purchased a huge very loud fan. another issue is with the thermostat, while the ac is on i noticed the numbers on the thermostat going up....either my ac unit just turned into a boiler or its giving a wrong reading..the final issue with the unit is with the auto mode...it just don't work. i pretty much gave it one star because the on/off button works."
2,Worked for 1 year,"I purchased this unit one year ago in the summer. It has worked extremely well to keep my bedroom cool, but after only just a year, it's begun malfunctioning. It randomly increases the set temperature and flashes ""E2"" on the screen. The button panel on the unit itself has ceased to function correctly. Pressing a button either doesn't work or causes a different button's action to happen. Thankfully the remote still works. I would recommend purchasing a different brand and a cheaper unit."
1,Not good,"This doesn't work at all. I have a relatively small one bedroom and it definitely doesn't cool the whole place, even with the bedroom door and bathroom door shut. I've tried putting it in just the bedroom and it works a little but not great. I've left it on all day and come home at night to see it is exactly the same temperature as it was when I left. Sometimes it is cooler outside than it is inside with this thing on. Absolutely do not recommend."
2,"Arrived dead, retailer is sending replacement. High hopes for replacement","The title says it. We received the first unit and it never blew cold. We let it run for 24hours nonstop with the cool setting turned on (not-auto). That didn't help. The temperature outside was consistently cooler by severla degrees then in side the 200sq foot room the unit was in. At one point it was 86 inside with the unit on, and 84 outside. Replacement arrived yesterday and I haven't had a chance to try it. The retailer air-n-water was very accommodating and sent replacement first with pre-paid shipping for the dead unit."
2,Returned it!,"Well, needless to say this product wasn't my best purchase. The thermostat really didn't work - If the unit was set to a certain temperature, it would stop cooling 5 degrees above that temp. So frustrating! Also, this unit is so loud when the compressor switches on. We now have the Sharp a/c unit from Home Depot (a much more expensive model), and the difference is amazing... I will say the air was cold however, when the unit was cooling...I will say this company was great about the return. They immediately sent a call tag to return the item (at their cost), and quickly issued the credit. I would definitely buy from them again - just not this product..."
4,Unit works; good customer service,"When the unit was first shipped, I opened it to discover it was covered in an oily substance, and when I turned it on it seemed the compressor was not working. The vent blew out room-temperature air. I reported the item as defective, and a new one was immediately shipped out with a free Fedex return label. The new unit works fine and is capable of cooling my 400 sq ft studio. Easy to install, and so far I've had no problem. The remote control is a nice bonus but batteries are not included (requires two AAA)."
5,"works great, and is quiet","Unit seems to work quite well, and is very quiet. Auto evaporate feature works nicely as well.So far seems to be good bang for the buck!"
1,Unit will not cool bedroom 1 degree,It's 78 degrees out side and this unit will not cool my bedroom to 77 degrees!The unit worked ok the first day and now it does not cool AT ALL!The unit also came with scratches and looks used. I wonder if they repackaged a broken unit and tried to pawn it off on me? I will be mailing it back today and getting a different unit.BE YE WARNED!
2,TWO YEAR AIR CONDITIONER,For two years it worked just fine. It is very noisy but I don't know if other units are also noisy. I hooked it up this year and it turned in just a noisy fan. No cooling power at all. I'm going to try a Black and Decker.
1,Doesn't Work,"This thing is junk. The compressor constantly overheats and turns the AC off. The manual says when this happens, to turn off the unit for a half-hour so the compressor can cool. I just did that and turned it back on. I timed how long the AC stayed on before turning off: 1 minute. What a joke. Find a better brand."
4,Cool like that,"We purchased this unit for our large bedroom with very high ceilings so that we can sleep up there in the summer, it had been working perfectly and does a great job! Well worth a little bit of noise and it's quiet er than a normal window unit. We and our 10 month old have no problem sleeping. I did alot of homework and the mixed reviews can drive you crazy, this is a solid buy for sure. Still have not had to empty tank after running for about 1 week full days at 80-90 degrees, and it does have auto shut off when full with indicator. We just purchased one from us kids for my mothers town home and she is now loving it, so no complaints here just check airnwater.com for sale codes this is where mine came from and I could have saved 30 bucks to order straight from them, amazon would not honor."
5,works very well,"I bought this to run in a small server closet at work. It runs 24x7 and does an excellent job keeping the room cool for all of the hardware. Overall, for my limited use it works great.Update: I had a problem not too long ago with the compressor but it was within the warranty period so I contacted the company, they issued an RMA # and all I had to do was return it and they sent out a new unit. Overall the process was pretty quick so I was pleased with the service they provided."
5,NewAir Portable Air Conditioning Unit,My initial package was received damaged. It was fast and easy to order a new one. I had it in my hands in 6 days flat. It works excelent! Easy to put together as well. It was well worth the money spent on it!
5,Wonderful book!,"I just finished this book and although it was long it was an easy read, and the time flew by as I read it. The characters are wonderful, they are so ""real"" and there is nothing unbelievable about them. It is an encouraging story of two sisters and their lives as they grow up and leave home. I would deffinately read this book again, and I recomend it to everyone! I am sad that it is over... you get really attached to the characters by the end."
5,tear-jerking,"I'm a very big fan of Lori Wick and I believe this to be one of her best books. I can see the main characters vividly and feel their joy and pain. I've never read a book which follows the characters from childhood to adulthood. Mackenzie and Delancey were like friends to me. It was amazing to read about their lives the way the author portrayed them. There were so many facets to the characters. I've read this book twice and will probably read it time and time again. It has some strong Christian viewpoints and shows how God's love can change even the hardest of hearts. If you like to be moved both emotionally and spiritually, I recommend this book to you. Wonderful!"
5,Prepare your emotions!,"After reading Princess by Lori Wick I decided to try some of her other books, and the next book I bought was Pretense. Although it was not at all like Princess, I loved it. I think every single emotion in my heart was stirred. I have been a Christian my entire life, so it was good for me to see what people are like before and after they get saved. I gave it to my best friend who read it in a day, and she said that Lori Wick portrayed unsaved people very well. (she was saved in high school) I also loved the sisterly bond that occured between the girls. It was such a real and true story! I couldn't put it down, and I would recommend it to anyone!!!"
5,Beautifully arrangened and emotion brimming.,"It was the most exciting novel I've read. It was worth the price and time. I couldn't put it down for more than 5min. The story line is so intricately put together. The lives of the characters come to life and I saw myself and my sister in it. I laughed, cried, smiled and felt the fellings that they did."
3,Good - but too long,"A good book overall however, whenever it seemed to lag, they would kill someone off. The storyline of the daughters inevitable conversion was predictable, yet inspiring. While slightly unrealistic, I finally got into it once I was about 1/4 of the way through the book. Many of the scenes seemed unnecessary. The core of the story was the search for God, and while I have mixed feelings about the book, that message was loud and clear."
3,"Lori Wick, my favorite author.","The story is good, but the book itself is a couple hundred pages too long. And also there is too much attention put on the outward appearance of the women and men. All young and handsome or beautiful!I have read 'Sophie's Heart' by Mrs. Wick about five times and feel like a part of Sophie's family. This story is believable!"
5,All-Time Favorite book,This is been my favorite book since it came out in 1998. I love that I can now carry it with me always on my iPhone and iPad through the Kindle app.
4,"Good, but long","This book is very good, but it's so long. It's a real tear jerker also, being one of the most realistic books I've ever read. It's a good read if you have time, but if you don't like long books or don't have time to read much, then I wouldn't recommend this."
4,Good but not great (like Sophie),"I read Pretense while on vacation. While I enjoyed the story and had trouble putting it down, I found the last half too long and drawn out when it didn't have to be. First Delancey gets sick and then she gets her guy and then Mackenzie gets sick and then she gets her guy. Also, I found that there were to many characters (who were insignificant to the story but present at different holidays, etc. that were listed each time they all got together). I found it hard to keep up with them and eventually skipped over it.Since this is only the second book of Lori Wick's that I've read, I will look forward to reading others by her. Of the two that I've read so far, Sophie's Heart, is my favorite. I loved Sophie so much that I've purchased copies for other people to read (so I didn't have to give them mine). I wouldn't have a problem recommending Pretense, and I also wouldn't have a problem handing over my copy."
3,"Could have been better, a bit overdone","Now, I normally like Lori Wick, but in my opinion, this wasn't one of her better ones. While the story line and plot was good, I found that some things she didn't finish filling in ""missing gaps"". For instance, the reason Marrell gets saved is because Sharon is first saved. It seemed like after Sharon got married and had a kid, Lori Wick dropped her as a character. I also found this book pretty depressing, although it does have a happy ending :) Also, it got overdone at points and I felt she was stretching one incident too much, and it made me less interested in the story. While I think Ms. Wick is a talented author, Pretense could have been a lot better if maybe she had a better editor!"
2,Too long that it really has to be.,"I enjoyed the story-line of this book, but I thought that Delancey and Mackenzie were almost too perfect. And what also got on my nerves was the fact that the author always used the expression :""Would that work?"" It really drove me crazy! I also didn't like the fact that Wick anouced peoples deaths a little too bluntly. For example:""Paul's dead."" And she also introduced Amanda to the reader without any warning. All in all I thought that the author could have said what she had to say in less pages. My friend read Pretense and it toke her like 5 days to get throught it. And she's a FAST reader! The whole time she was complaning how bad it was. The only reason she did'nt stop reading it was because she always finishes what she starts. I think Lori needs to take some lessons from Francine Rivers."
1,Disappointed.,I couldn't get through the book. All the books I have read by Lori Wicks have been great. But this one. I have to put it down.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I have read many Lori Wick books because they are good wholesome stories; I was, however, disappointed in the author after reading ""Pretense"". The book showed an interesting story-line, but as a Christian reader I was appalled by the unnecessary, explicit detail of the young girls' sinful lives. I understand that non-Christian's--such as the characters were--will not lead moral, Christian lives; but I thought much of the detail was extremely unnecessary. I also tired quickly of the dialogue. Much of it was over-used phrases and non-realistic conversation. I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
2,too long and drawn out,"I have read many Lori Wick books and enjoyed them all. This book, however, was much to long and drawn out. The characters were not as good as what I am used to from Ms. Wick. The book seemed to go in circles. The beginning and ending were good, but the middle was boring."
3,MUCH TOO LONG,"This was my first book by Lori Wicks. She is a nice writer, and her sentiments about the Lord and our need for Him are well founded. The characters were interesting for a time, and the plot feasible. BUT, after 400 pages, it began to lag, droning on and on, until I had to force myself to finish. I have read books with 1200 pages, and thought each word needed to be on the parchment, but this was an exercise in futility the last 300. I will read her again, but I pray she will realize that more is not better."
4,Epic novel,"Pretense is about two sisters' journey from disinterest in, rebellion towards, and finally surrender to God. The first third of the book focuses on their mother while the girls are growing up and gives the reader a good idea of the girls' background. I enjoyed that part of the book the most since the girls' parents Paul and Marrell Bishop made such a romantic couple. I am a huge Lori Wick fan and will read anything she writes, but I wished she had taken her own advice and chopped off all unnecessary scenes from the book and cut it down from 700 to 500 pages. Overall, a good story and enjoyable reading--I read almost non-stop and finished it in two and a half days."
4,Pretense,"While I enjoyed this book, I thought it was not her best work. I think she let things drag out a little too long. And a few of the early scenes could easily be deleted as well. But in parts, it was absolutely gripping, so it is still a very good book."
4,An important contribution,"An important contribution to a critical subject. Change management consulting often suffers from ""hack"" approaches. Whether change can in fact be managed is another issue."
3,"It swivels great, BUT DOES NOT LOCK IN PLACE!","It does exactly what I wanted it to do....swivel the kitchen TV from side to side. It swivels easily and smoothly, but I've discovered that it does not lock into place once you've positioned it where you want it. I'm using it with a 19"" flat screen TV. We have cable hooked up to the back of the TV, and the cable is thick and fairly inflexible. As a result, the inflexible cable pulls/pushes the TV on the swivel plate back to center because it does not lock in place. I have to use a heavy paperweight to ""hold"" the TV in position. It's annoying and a hassle, but I'm going to continue using it until I find something better. At least I don't have to shift the TV itself from side to side, and I can avoid leaving fingerprints on the TV frame and screen.If I didn't have the cable hooked up to the back, then I would have given a higher rating...4 stars. It's not the manufacturer's fault that I have to attach a cable to my TV, but it still doesn't lock into place."
4,Using on 21 inch monitor,"I bought for my 21 inch computer monitor. It works well, but as others have noted, it has a tendency to not stay where I want it. By positioning the wires straight out from the monitor, this helps to keep it centered."
3,dc99er,"This product does what it was designed to do. However, the quality of this product is not what I expected. The swivel is very ""tinny"", and not put together very well. I guess you get what you pay for. The price is cheap, but after you add in shipping costs, I don't think it is worth it."
1,"Way too ""spinny""","I read all the other reviewers complaining about how it doesn't have a locking mechanism, and I thought it wouldn't apply to me since I hadn't planned on putting it on a slant. But even on a flat surface, the heavy gauge antenna cable in the back of the flat screen tv pretty much controls every movement. This turntable spins so easily that it'll simply spin to where the antenna cable decides it is most comfortable. Very annoying, and maybe giving the turntable more friction or tension in the mechanism would prevent this from happening. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this."
5,Can you really go wrong?,"With a title like ""The Gas We Pass?""Santa brought this to my step-daughter (the flatulence queen). Good, good stuff. :)"
4,great ironic gift,"Hilariously lacking in cohesiveness. Filled with non-sequiturs and random farts, some of which are emitted from animals that make you wonder, ""what the hell is that thing?"" There are probably better ways to educate your child on farts. However, like ""Everyone Poops,"" it makes an excellent ironic gift for adults to give each other, and can add a few chuckles to a party."
1,Not as expected and not recommended.,"I was dissappointed with this book. While it starts out ok, it quickly deteriates. Imagine, telling children to go ahead, let that fart out. Not that I think a child can't fart, but, what about some common courtesy to those around that may have to smell that fart. This book was also too technical for children or at least not written to a reasonable level. Not Recommended, keep looking, there are better books on the subject, ones that will review the subject in an educational but entertaining manner."
2,The gas we pass,This book didn't keep my kids attention for very long. To me it felt like I was reading a health text book. Also the pictures were not drawn real well.
2,Not that Great,"This books starts off pretty good. I like the fart humor, but then it gets into the scientifics. i am not against kids learning the science of gas, but it almost feels like two different books. the beginning seems like a good book to give a young child who is just learning about bodily functions. but then it starts getting into specifics and it feels like it needs an older audience. it's not a bad book. it's just not the books i was expecting."
5,This is gasalicious baby!,"This book was incredible! Farting is soooo great! Everytime I fart I kill a plant! My gas is actually a very thick substance that smells likes old puked up mice terd! O man, if I could fart all the time, trust me I would! My favorite fart noises are the silent but deadly ones. Mine aren't deadly though, they're just viscious! My house is like a natural gas tank! When my baby sister was born she almost suffocated from my toxic waste! We called her Anal after me! When I'm in school i pass gas in my teacher's face if i'm tired of listening to her! Touting is something that's very healthy and effective, so don't be afraid to do what i do best: FART!Sincerly, Lucy Ray the gas-loving hobo!"
1,No pedo/science for my family thanks.,"The Picture of the naked young boy and man in the bathtub was unnecessary and just a little too Pedo/science for me.Some of the facial expressions make the people look angry or just plain weird.I'm sending it back, not what I want for my kids."
1,so bad,"Bloody idiots! You sound like two year olds! ""My friend Rachel Ferachi has so much gas..."" ""My baby sister almost suffocated because of my farts..."" Seriously, COME ON! I have blue hair today and even I know how stupid that sounds!!! Yikes! And to Shinto Cho, if ya read this: If you really aspired to be an author, wouldn't you have worked a little harder? This looks like it was thrown together in like, how long? Twenty minutes? No, probably less. And I'm a KID and I can draw better than those illustrations. I wanna see a resume from this illustrator! Can she draw any better than THAT? I'm actually considering that as my career since SHE made it. But no more dissing today. Off to review GOOD books. Unlike this one."
1,"If only it had a good old-fashioned ""scratch n' sniff""","Decades ago, even Larry Flynt saw the beauty of putting a well-placed scratch-n-sniff in his magazine. So why not these authors? They didn't even do that with their other in-depth analysis of ""Everybody Poops"" (something I'm glad they wrote because, frankly, until they told me, I thougt I was alone in that regard). Anyway, there are definitely closeted issues going on with this Amanda lady and her choice of subject matter for kids. She's definitely trying to bring to the surface some type of fetish issues of her own, and, maybe that's ok when it's cleverly disguised as ""Willy Nilly the Boobly-Goobily goes 'PFFFFT' and it gets all stinky in the room."" But, again, there's definitely something amiss in the house of these authors. Just be aware. Enjoy otherwise."
1,The Gas We Pass,"Nasty! A big stinker! Plus why would an author write such a lame story about farts! In my opinion, this book was practically funny because it was cheesy! Don't read this book because farts are so inappropriate to write about! Note: WATCH OUT FOR THAT ELEPHANT--he may cut big ones!"
1,stupid,"I rated it one star because you cannot rate lower, that is the lowest rating. This book is(pardon the expression)RETARDED! It is ridiculous how enamored people are with passing gas. As for that kid who said he has a friend named rachel, and he and her enjoy tooting together, let me tell you: You sound like a three year old, and your friend Rachel sounds like somebody needs to jump on her back once or twice and get all the gas out. PLEASE! PEOPLE! THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE SUBJECT! I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF PUBLISHER WOULD PUBLISH THIS GARBAGE!! Okay, sorry about the tirade, but honestly people..."
3,A More Advanced Book than I'd Anticipated,"I really thought that this book would appeal to my 2 year old, who I am potty training. I was wrong. This book is really more for a 5 year old or possibly older. After all, what school age kid doesn't think that farting is hilarious. The pictures are great, but the story isn't appealing for small kids."
5,The Lords of Flatulence Approve,"Yes, I DID send this wonderful little tome for my wee young nephew, but not before the Lords of Flatulence (John & David, if you are interested) passed their approval as well as a bit of intestinal gas. Sure to delight young boys (and a few gals) and to move you up to Eccentric Grownup Status too. I'd change the age range from 18 mos.-4 years to 18 mos. to 50 or so."
3,Well done,Nice job on the book. How can people not like books about farts? Check out the lastest by Bach Anon called Dropping Almonds to see how poop serves as a good metaphor in corporate America.
5,The Gas We Pass : The Story of Farts,This has to be the most hilarious book I've ever read! I fell out of my chair at my doctors office waiting room I was laughing so hard. The girls in the office love watching the patients reactions to this wonderful read. This is such a great way to explain farting to kids. Very interesting!
4,Hilarious book but there is some things to look out for...,"Bought this book for a friend's daughter who turned 10 this July. I thought this book would be a perfect gag gift that's actually somewhat useful. I was torn between buying this or ""Everybody Poops"" but thought this was more appropriate.The book is hilarious and definitely something a preschooler or kindergartner could read with their parents. There is some innocent drawn nudity (boy bathing with his dad) so if you're wary about that, I'd suggest buying something else. But honestly, it's like a kid's drawing and you could tell it's not intended to offend. Just a forewarning for those worried about things like that."
5,so very Japanese,"My husband and I found this book in a store in Little Tokyo (LA) and laughed. It is ""so Japanese"" as my nisei HD pointed out. Later when we had a kid we made sure this book was in her library. It's one of her favorites! Not only is it educational it is fun.The illustrations are cartoony and anatomically correct; which will likely freak out most Americans, but it's just biology and teaches kids that what's going on in their bodies is natural and that everyone does it.Defiantly a good book for kids curious about their bodies."
1,To the reviewer below mine:,"I'm the one you wrote to, remember? Wanted to let you know i did NOT read this book, I read it with my best friend to her little sister because she so desperately wanted to hear it. Also, I reviewed the book because I wanted to warn parents and kids not to buy it. Thirdly, like, you get a life... you're writing to people who reviewed stuff badly? C'mon."
1,rubbish,this is a book by an asian lady that talks about gas yes farting now im just not cool enough to pay money for a book about gas whenever i see something this incredibly stupid i realise how much smarter and charming i am than most of society
1,Don't think you are safe!,"We thought we were safe from the wrath of disgusting books! But alas, publishers once again chose to re-disturb all of us. There must be a problem our country has about not knowing where poop and gases come from! I personally must be a genius to have known about these things since I was very young. As a matter of fact, I'm so proud of myself I might just go on a tour to teach the people of America about these crucial moments of ones life! Adios! I am off!"
4,Pretty funny,"I got this book along with ""Everyone Poops"" and they just crack me up. Very good books! Pictures will have you rolling on the floor laughing!"
4,No Gassing in the Classroom Please,"Here's an amusing little book that explains the physiology of the fart. The amateurish-looking graphics actually give the book a classic timeworn look, as if it were a classic fairy tale. Some of the ""facts"" are interesting, such as the amount of gas released by a fart and the gas amount released by a person in a day.I like the inclusion of potato farts and the comment that potato farts don't smell bad. The claim that bean farts also have a benign odor is open to debate.Overall I think young boys (and their fathers) might get a kick out of this book.Be aware that there's a picture of the farting boy standing naked in a bathtub. I don't think it was necessary to show his ding-a-ling. We know he's a boy."
3,cute book,"This is a cute book to explain a ""tabu"" topic to your kids.... it's funny, but biological and matter of fact. The only thing is it's really for an older child that can read books that are kind of long and understand more complicated concepts and words. My 1 1/2 yr old loves ""Everyone Poops"" and I thought this was similar but it's completely different, better for a 6 or 7 yr old."
3,Venona Files Critic,"Naming names in the Verona Files isn't exactly a credible indictment of thosed named, because the Soviets never used the actual names of real spies in their communications. When they were talking about their real agents, the Soviets always used code names.Whenever they used a person's real name, it was in some context that had nothing to do with spying (or perhaps as a target of their real spies), or they expected the communication to be intercepted, and were passing on disinformation. The Verona files don't really ""prove"" anything and the information is only useful to the trained intelligence communty. Unfortunately, they've been misused quite frequently by McCarthy apologists and other propagandists to sucker the gullible."
2,Pre-seen,"My cousin works at a movie store and he had just got in a very small order of Witch Hunter, we watched it(with the ok from his boss)and we laughed at how bad it was! I gave the movie the 2nd star because i was too entertained by laughing."
1,This Is NOT Beat Street,"I went to this site expecting to find the real Beat Street movie, and deflated like a balloon when I realized this wasn't it (It took me a second, though). Be careful, folks! Don't Buy This One!"
1,not the real BeatStreet,"this aint the beatstreet that we all love and enjoy, it doesnt contain raimo, kenny, lee, or crazy legs and the rock steady crew. BeatStreets like a heart beat"
1,THIS IS NOT THE REAL BEAT STREET!!!!,"DON'T LISTEN TO THE OTHER 2 PEOPLE THAT REVIEWED THIS, THIS IS NOT THE REAL BEAT STREET THAT THE TRUE HIP-HOP HEADS KNOW. IF YOU ORDERED IT CANCEL YOUR ORDER.(I SENT MINE BACK)!!!!!"
1,BY THE WAY...THIS AIN'T THE MOVIE,"So check it out. It is obvious that Breakin, Breakin 2, Rappin, and BeatStreet are no longer available. It's a shame. These movies are iconic of a definite stage in a particular social structure of our lives. I sure hope these movies are documented somewhere. I am a music teacher and we just did a study on HipHop as a culture. Fortunately, I was able to find Breakin I and Breakin II. If ANYONE has these movies on tape, I would love to see them. Please respond to the email address below.Thanks. Ronrfl@ebicom.net"
4,Not pretty but very functional,"The cone filter holder works well for making single cups of coffee. It's not really necessary if you do have a coffee maker, but perhaps good if you just have a tea kettle or other means of heating the water.The set of the mug and the cone is an odd pairing of two different shades of red that are not asthetically pleasing to me, but the cone fits on other mugs and travel mugs so I don't bother with the included one. I don't know why I expected it to match and look pretty!Also, the shipping is a bit steep for such a small, inexpensive item, but it came well-packed in lots of padding."
4,inexpensive and does what it says it will,"for a bare bones freeze alert unit, this one is excellent. I tested it to see if it would sense the cold temperature outside (was in the 30's); it worked and called the number I'd programmed. I think it needs a longer than one minute send time for its message. I had it call my cell phone and I needed to change the number of rings and the length of my cell message to assure I'd get the alarm call. (Or keep the phone off which wasn't always practical.) Other than that, it was just what I needed for the price. Customer/tech support was fine, too. At $[...] rebate it was a very good deal."
4,Robert,"I have a cabin in northern Mi.and during the winter in the back of my mind i wonder is the furnace running? One night on my TV news home inprovement tips they showed the freeze alarm and I couldnt beleive it this is axactly what I needed , that night I started checking on the internet and found Amazon.com had the best price and I find that a small price to pay for the peace of mind I get . I found it easy to program and although I didnt test in my freezer I did the key board manual test and it called my cell phone so Im happy and one day ill put it outside and check it out for real but for the time being Im happy."
1,Cheap,"After one year you replace the battery....however, the wire connector to the battery breaks! Out of warranty after one year...let the buyer beware!"
4,This can save you a lot of money,"Simple to hook up and easy to program. This will dial a phone number to alert you that you may have a potential freeze up situation. This early warning can save you thousands of dollars. If you are in a cold climate and have a vacant property or are going on vacation, this is a very inexpensive piece of protection. It will call every 2 hours until deactivated. I know it works, it saved my home!"
