5,AACKS,I HAVE USED THIS SET OF COMMENTARIES FOR YEARS. THE NEW MATERIAL IS HELPFUL AND THE FORMAT MAKES IT EASY TO ACCESS THE PASSAGES I WANT TO STUDY
5,Excellent Study Guide,"Searching for a Matthew study guide/commentary on Matthew's gospel for my adult class, I decided on NT Wright's. Hemming and hawing as I usually do, I read a review that said, ""This study guide is almost as good as William Barclay."" That settled it! I have used Barclay's Daily Study Bible off and on for forty years. It is hard to beat. Readable, smart, inspiring, faith filled - you can't do better. Barclay was a man of faith, a man of extraordinary scholarship, a man with a gift from God to take the most esoteric scholarship and make it not only readable but enjoyable, a man with a pastor's heart, and a love of the Lord. I have some tapes of a Barclay speech where he says, ""The Bible is a book about Jesus."" People WANT to prepare for class when they have Barclay in front of them. My class loves it!If you know the ""old"" Barclay, rest assured this update is even better!"
4,Convenient!,This little volume is very handy to use--makes me wish I had the whole set on my Kindle! I'd recommend this to anyone!
4,The Rest of the Story,"If you are a reader of the Bible, I am sure there area questions that arise about what was going on in the world around Jesus and his disciples when they were conducting their ministry. Barkley lets us in on what was happening in the world at this time and how Jesus relates to it. The Sermon on the Mount is made more meaningful and we find it was probably more than one sermon, not spoken all at one time. This is just one of the things I am finding very interesting."
4,good study tool,I LIKE STUDYING THE BIBLE AND THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW HAS HELPED ME IN UNDERSTANDING THE GOSPEL TEACHING.THE BOOK ALSO WAS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AS PROMISED
4,met expectations,One of my most favorite biblical authors. Would recommend any of his books. Scholarly yet understandable to the average reader.
3,Good way to study for church.,"If you need to do research, or just want to read more about The Gospel of Matthew, this book is for you."
5,Very special,"Celibidache was a truly great musician who, on principle, refused to make edited studio recordings. All his recordings with Munich are live concert recordings. There is great beauty of sound and a wonderful ""breathing"" flexibility in these performances. I rarely just sit down and listen to a recording--especially of pieces I've played for years and which I know so well. If I do, I tend to be fairly critical and hard to please. I, however, found these performances to be very beautiful and moving.There have been many great recordings of Brahms Symphonies through the years and I would hesitate to recommend one version as ""the best"".Celibidache, though, is definitely near the top of my list."
1,Plastic!,It is almost impossible to determine if these wall supplies and holders are solid or plastic. Even the spec sheets don't always tell you. So I will let you know that if you are looking for solid brass don't buy this item as it is plastic and weighs almost nothing. I can't imagine this holding up to constant use by putting a heavy shower head in and out of it. And it is very expensive for a piece of plastic. I will keep looking.
4,Good Christie,"This is one of my favorite Christie books because the plot is easily imaginable even by today's standards. As she often does, the mistress of mystery builds a great detective story around a seemingly simple plot."
5,A CLASSIC IN ITS GENRE,"Although first published in 1950 ""A Murder Is Announced"" by vaunted mystery writer Agatha Christie has lost none of its zest. Deemed a classic in its genre this suspenseful tale is mesmerizing.When invitations are sent reading ""A murder is announced, and will take place on Friday, October 29th, at Little Paddocks at 6:30 p.m.,"" everyone, including the indomitable Jane Marple, would anticipate an unusual party game. Such as, someone will be chosen as the murderer, the room is darkened, and the victim meets his fate.It's not all fun and games when a real dead body is found. Miss Marple, on your mark! With her inimitable skill Agatha Christie allows listeners to enjoy solving the crime, step by step, just as much as Miss Marple does.Curl up in an easy chair and revel this remarkable tale."
3,"A game of ""murder"" leads to a young man's death","I thought some of the back story was slightly interesting, but the investigator characters seemed under defined. A few details of the story placed it in the 1950s, but I really didn't feel engrossed in the plot. I think it was a so-so read."
4,Vintage Christie,"Many characters - intricate and subtle plot. I didn't get it until the murderer was identified, which was almost on the last page."
5,from the Medical Herbalism journal,"The most popular materia medicas on Chinese herbs, by Bensky and by Hsu, for the most part leave out details of scientific research. This book fills that gap in the current English language literature on Chinese herbs. Zhu offers extensive details on in vitro research, and, when available, human clinical trials for all the major herbs in use in China today, as well as a brief overview of traditional use."
4,a facsinating eye opener,"""johnny in the spot"" is a facsinating story, that outlines clearly, the choices, complications, implications, and predicaments associated with the simple, but not so simple issues of sexuality.A must for every young adult living in the twenty first century era."
5,SOMEONE BRING BACK THIS GEM!,For god's sake wil someone do the world a favor and bring this book back into printing. Every square inch of this book has a small joke that makes you laugh so hard that drool runs down your face and you will be unable to think until you calm yourself.
5,Please Reprint!,"Will the world listen to the plea of thousands and reprint this masterpiece of 60's parody!!! I cannot face the future without seeing Ms. Armbruster one more time! Also, I need to see the Dacron, Ohio newspaper parody too! Please, dear lord, to see the joy in my teenage children's eyes as they read these wonders for the first time would hearten my soul forever!!!"
5,A must read!,"This book is one of my favorite romance stories this year. It will make you fall in love with Jake. I also love the character of Catalina, she's innocent but feisty. Sandra Marton does not disappoint. She's a superb writer."
3,Cute Story by Marton,"Though her skills for romance have definitely faded with her latest 2007 batch of books, Marton is on point here in the final installment of The Ramirez Brides series.That the male lead, Jake, is relatively well-adjusted is a breath of fresh air. He's clever, but not without a sense of humor, strong and stubborn but not the overdone ""Alpha Male"". Though he dates beautiful women he is not the typical playboy so wary of the grasping gold-diggers of the world.The female counterpart is naive and stubborn due to being raised in a convent- that being said, it is surprising how quickly she and Jake fall into bed together but then again this is Harlequin!Not a bad book, in fact it is one of my favorites."
5,quite perfect : ),"Because it`s a little different than below I write the back cover text also: She`s young, innocent and rich...Catarina Mendes, at twenty-one, is finally free and independent woman. However, it`s freedom at a price...Bound to a stranger...Jake Ramirez has become guardian to Cat. He must protect her from unscrupulous men and find her a husband. By her most precious gift! Jake is overwhelmed by Cat`s beauty, but she`s still a virgin. Can he resist bedding her-before he finds her a suitable husband...? *The Ramirez Brides-serie...three half brothers, on opposite sides of the globe: each must find a bride, to find each other...*"
5,a great documentary about a documentary,"If you liked The Leopard Son, you will like the film about making that film. The movie had natural beauty, the ""making of"" has even more of it, as ""what did not go in the film', because that footage didn't have any leopards in it. You will love the Serengeti after watching the film (about the film). It is also nice to see all the people who made The Leopard Son possible. And yes, there is about 6 minute os Stewart Copeland making and talking about composing his wonderful score (for Copeland fans)And it's only a few bucks, don't miss your chance to buy it!"
3,128MB version much better value,Don't bother with this model when the 128MB model is only about $10 more.
5,A MUST SEE DVD!!,"When i saw this movie on television, i was wondering why wasn't this on dvd to begin with because there were parts from the original that were missing, and this dvd clearly shows the important parts that were missing from the original dvd such as Dr. Lomis warning the other doctors that Micheal is dangerous, that to me is the most important part of the dvd and such others. I am glad i brought this dvd because when i found out that this was out, i was searching for a long time including going from store to store and had no choice but to buy it online. I highly recommend people who are fans of this movie to buy the dvd because if you watch this version, it makes more sense than the original dvd"
5,Halloween,"This is without a doubt thegreatest modern horror film.It is genuinely scary, evenafter repeated viewings. Themusic score is awesome. Itremains the greatest theme music of all time.The similar films which cameafter it(Friday the 13th,Scream and the like are by no means of a quality evenremotely close to this. Buythis video now, but be sure to get it in widescreen format. And do yourself a favor and avoid ALL ofthe sequels as they will justmake you scream for more of this original classic."
4,Halloween,"This movie was pretty scary with all of the music in the background and when Michael was chasing the girls around. I did think that there was going to be a little more action or gore, though. But I did enjoy the movie!"
4,New meaning of Halloween.,"This movie is one of the best horror movies of all time.If you like the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street series (witch are great movies)your gonna love this series of horror movies.In this movie when you think he's gonna pop out and just kill somebody,he dosen't and when he kill's someone your not expecting it.It's made poorly,but it dosen't really need any special effect's,and since it was made in the 80's.It's hard to believe it's Jamie Lee Curtises first movie.She play's her part like she's done it before.Not all the actor's are great but it's a great movie.If you like horror movies like some of us in the world see this movie."
3,the orignal and best,i really think this is a great movie. it set he slasher genre some friday the 13th fans try to say that jason was better but really he just a copy of michel. this flim devilers scare and gives you a creepy feeling long after wards. i relly like the haunt shot at the benging of six year old micheal holding the knife with that look on his face.
5,best movie,this is the best horror movie ever made. i dont see why it does not have all five stars who is the loser who did not give halloween a 5 star should be killed by Michael Myers. i have all the halloween movies and can not wait untill HALL8WEEN comes out.
3,So much potential...,"Generally, I don't like slasher horror flicks. I like on-screen violence, therefore it does not scare me. However, I decided that I should probably at least rent the definitive slasher flick, which turned out to be better than I expected. I think the biggest problems occured in the second half of the movie, when Michael Myers actually kills people. I found little to be frightened of at that point. The beginning of the movie, on the other hand, was unbelievable. The scenes when Laurie finds Myers stalking her at every turn bring chills. As far as movies in this specific horror genre go, it is of course the best. However, I think that the director could have done much more with the movie if he could have kept the eerie random appearances of Myers as the main source of scares rather than the murders themselves."
2,"Nowadays, this is pure B-comedy!","The first one in the series of (so far?) seven Halloween movies probably was a superbly scary thriller-horror movie in 1978 - but for today's public, it rather appears as a comedy.There is barely any blood in it, and Michael Myers is easy to knock down (even though he doesn't die, of course...) by a young Jamie Lee Curtis who, by the way, look like herself, she only had longer hair and a smaller behind back then.The real surprise in fact comes in the beginning of the movie where we see who Michael Myers really is!"
1,What a missed opportunity,"I have the 20th and 25th anniversary of Halloween, and both are valid and worth having. Besides the film, they each have different special features that are ""totally"" informative about the making of this classic. This new release sounds like a big waste of time and money. I've never been a fan of Halloween 4-9 so that's certainly no incentive to buy this. Especially when you consider it's missing 2 and 3. For the 30th anniversary this should have been a blowout dvd with tons of new info attached. Do yourself a favor and get either the 20th or 25th on eBay. Screw Anchor Bay"
5,"""Halloween"" is one of these BEST HORROR films","If you are looking for a horror movie where it will make you feel a spine-chilling, ankle grabbing and grasping in every minutes then this one you're looking for!"
5,5 stars!!!!,"15 years ago a little boy kills his sister and now it""s 15 years later and he came home-very scary-iam telling you to watch 1,and 2 of halloween to get an idea of Halloween H20[twenty years later]."
5,A+++++,Halloween is the best horror movie of all time. It is responsible for making me the horror fanatic that I am. John Carpenter is a master mind at scaring people. His plots are very good and he did a great job with this movie.
5,Watch it on Blu Ray!!,"I don't need to go over the story of Halloween. But, I do need to tell you about the fantastic Blu Ray edition of this film. The sound is great, and the picture quality is unbelievable. The high def picture of this old film is astonishing. It is so sharp, crystal clear and life-like that it makes you feel as if you are actually there. You haven't seen the original Halloween unless you have seen it on Blu Ray."
2,"""Halloween"" a tedious and routine slasher flick","For some reason, John Carpenter's 1978 horror film ""Halloween"" is regarded as a masterpiece by not only horror fans, but respected critics as well. ""Halloween"" is a simple, poorly acted, overly-routine, overlong, and extremley dull slasher movie that should not be confused for a better, more sophisticated film. The only reason this trash gets two stars is because of Carpenter's unique and inventive directing style and intresting camera angles."
2,Two stars for bonus features,"Were this a review solely on the film, this would have rated a one star. The transfer has been altered, with blues and oranges washed out. Along with that, it is the theatrical version of the film. Nit picking maybe, but you would think a 25th anniversary edition would have warrented the film being presented in its full glory.The bonus features are basically the only reason to buy this DVD. You can't ask for anything more from the commentary and excellent documentary. Just too bad Artisan couldn't make this a real treat for the fans."
3,"Scary mood, atmosphere but ultimately fails to scare.","I watched this movie for the first time right before Halloween hoping to get in the mood with a good spooky movie. It turns out, this movie - overall - did not frighten me the way the reviews say. Honestly, it has got a great atmosphere and mood, but ultimately it fails to deliver. Why does it fail? Because Michael Myers is just not scary enough for me because he is human. Even though he is psycho, he is still human and his dark motive is initiated by his disorder and not his own ideas. I just think it is just not enough to create Myers as a scary guy. This movie is more disturbing if anything, but definately not terrorful."
3,Good If you don't own one,"The pack is pretty good,This stuff is recommended if you don't own one.The only issue i felt was the mask coming along was considerably smaller than the picture posted.Anyways I am really happy to have to have this collection"
2,UGHHHHHH..............,This movie was nice and scary but there are a few things that this halloween movie is MISSING: this movie has NO gore 2nd does not show michael myers and 3rd ITS BORING. I think halloween 2 4 5 6 and H20 was the best in the series but if u want nice gore and see micheal myers killing people in gory ways than watch the others in the series but stay away from this crap! and stay away from HALLOWEEN 3 that has NO micheal myers and NO gore again!
5,Mike Myers Horror Fans,Cause it came undamaged and I love Halloween moviesI would recommend it to anyone who a big fan of Micheal Myers!!
5,Purchased DVD for a gift,This was purchased as a gift and haven't heard of any complaintsand yes I would recommend this to anyone and everyone :)
5,The Start of Michael's Never Ending Reign,"This was probaly the best of the Halloweens and I thoguht it stunk the first time around. Then the second time I started to appreciate Michael in a different way. I thought of him as a good guy not a bad brutal serial killer. I've seen all of them except 3,4 and ressurection but people say 3 and ressurection don't count anyway. Dr. Loomis doesn't have such a big role in this one but he sure does in the next few one's. Out of the 3 huge killers Michael's my second fave next to Freddy but Halloween's plot is so rich I could watch them all day. Jamie was good in this and she was good in 2 and H20 but this series really belongs to Donald Plesence."
2,"Boring,but ok","This is just another plain low budget 70's movie,it was a little bit creep,it did go pretty slow,but Michael Myers is just too dam good,i only liked it cause its a Halloween movie and i love them too much,but still great movie,just a little too slow,it is worth the watch or even buying it."
4,Good...for a horror movie!,"I really enjoyed this low budget filming masterpiece. This film has basically not one drop of blood, but it does not need it. This film revolutionized horror films, and if you watch this film on Halloween night with the lights off, I guarantee you will be paranoid to get up when the film is over, because you know Micheal Myers is waiting for you behind a closed door. BOO!"
4,HALLOWEEN- THE SLASHER MOVIE THAT TERRIFIED A NATION,"Penned by John Carpenter and Debra Hill in 1978 neither writer would never have realises how famous this slasher flick would become. To date several sequels have been added to its original, which are not half bad to say the least. Enough about that it is time to review Halloween in detail. This film to be quite honest, scared the wits out of me. Michael Myers, institutionalized for the murder of his sister escapes 15 years later. His doctor (played by the late Donald Pleasance) makes every effort to catch the psychotic killer before anyone falls victim to him. Jamie Lee Curtis (her debut movie) plays Laurie Strode, the person Michael Myers is mainly after. this film is very exciting, full of surprises and I was very pleased with it. The music really sets the scene of a crazed stalker killer coming to kill and kill again. Get out the popcorn leave the lights on when you watch this movie! It's not for the fainthearted."
1,"Halloweener? No, a Hollow Weiner.","This movie is not good. ... Past mindless complaints, this movie is fairly plotless, and riddled with idiocy. For instance, why does the killer spend three-fourths of the movie standing around as scary music plays? The horrors of men standing in silly masks, save me! Save your laughter for the scene in which his standing theme resembles the sound of a jet propulsion system. Also, pass the time wondering why Jamie Lee Curtis does not figure out that the killer is probably not dead when she stabs him in the thigh. While this might kill some, he has already survived a coathanger in the eye and a long needle driven into his ear, so you might not want to turn your back. She does, so he can try to kill her again. Also, the killer is generally more impotent than pre-Viagra Bob Dole. Real killers hang in movies like ""Welcome to Spring Break."" ...Skip Banacheck is a better hero than Jamie Lee any day."
1,John (Over-Rated) Carpenter!,Released at the same time as Dawn of the Dead. I would pick Dawn of the Dead over Halloween any day! The mask of William Shatner on Michael (The Shape) Myers face looks like he just came back from a Star Trek Convention! I recommend HELLRAISER instead over this piece of tripe! We have such sights to show you...
1,very WACK,"This aint no classic, this is a boring piece of [stuff].For one thing, the curse of myers and H20 are much better.This has no gore at all, but I will say that Myers is a scary lookin [dude], but this doesnt compare to any of the friday the 13ths even jason takes manhatton is better than this so please dont waste yo money on this pile of wack."
1,This is not a treat but a trick,why do people like this trash it isn't scary nor interesting and the movie is slow paced that it looks like director John Carpenter shot this while walking slowly and the movie is low budget there is hardly any blood or good special effects instead fans like it for its so-called suspense and laughable scares. The main plot is a boy who murdered his sister and returns years later to kill babysitters in his hometown. Halloween is no treat but a trick. Fans of horror films should rent something better. The only good part is when Jamie Lee Curtis is laying on the ground and in the background Michael Myers sits up slowly looking at her.
1,Knifes and Pumpkins abound in this avant-garde blood fest!,"Blood and nudity abound in this tasteless thriller, starring Jamie Lee Curtis as a good girl babysitter, whose scanty friends get slaughtered off one by one, by a killer in a mask.All is well, until Miss Curtis' friends, who are babysitting at the neighbors, don't answer her phone calls and she notices all the lights next door are off. So Miss Curtis heads across the street... From there, things fall apart until they reach an asinine conclusion.The terrifyingly haunting music is the only thing that keeps this show from being a complete waste of time.Despite other opinions, this film DOES deserve its `R' rating, due to its gruesome themes, let alone the violence, language, and semi-clad babysitters.All in all, enjoy ""Halloween"" if you must, but PLEASE don't consider it to be a favorite."
5,Happy Halloween fan here.,The one that started them all.This is truely a instant classic. The way Donald Pleasance gives those very eerie speeches. A not to mention the start of the lovely and talented actress Jamie Lee Curtis. Michael is always the best. (Was that the boogeyman?)
4,Great movie,Got this movie for my wife and it's cool... Love HD I would get it to bring Halloween to another level...
4,"""Horror Classic!""","Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis star in John Carpenter's1978 horror film. A doctor hunts an escaped killer stalking ababysitter and her friends. This is one of the 1st dvd versionsI've bought and it not only has good picture and sound, butit's extended with 4 scenes shot for tv. You can also findthis extended cut in the 2-disc limited edition. Definitelyadd this horror classic to your collection."
2,Not All There!,"For anyone thinking they are getting ALL the Halloween movies up to this point be very clear, this overpriced release includes:Halloween (three versions of the original masterpiece: Restored, Extended, and Blu Ray)Halloween 4 The Return Of Michael MyersHalloween 5 The Revenge Of Michael MyersHalloween: 25 Years Of Terror (Documentary Disc)Cheap MaskThree movies,one doc,one mask, $45. That is all."
5,Awesome!!!,It's my favorite horror movie and now I watch it on bluray it's freaking awesome and I love it even more.
3,GOOD BUT.....NOT COMPLETE,"This is a pretty good dvd. Although, things were missing that were very important. First, the extended edition which had the 12 minutes of deleted scenes in it should've been included in the dvd. Also, due to the film being shot during spring the crew had to paint leaves for the neighborhood. As I recall this movies name is Halloween, it doesnt look like that compared to the old version because they made the grasss so bright than it took away the fall colors. It now looks like spring in the movie. The special feature disc is great with all new interviews w/ the cast and crew which is 87 minutes and more on that disc. Anchor Bay, I wish you had included the extended editon and I'm not spending another 20 bucks for another movie that I already own in 3 forms. Anyways it has good sound and it gives you a storybook to go along with the DVD. Even though they forgot to include some things it is still mi favorite Horror flick."
4,Halloween 25th Anniversary,"I am not sure what all the whining about the ""color hues"" is about, but the picture is sharp with little, if any artifacting. An excellent picture! My only gripe is it would have been nice to have the TV footage as well. The extras are great with new info. It is a great supplement to my 1999 double disk from AnchorBay, with a better picture."
5,An Absolute Classic,"The original Halloween is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and my personal favorite. Even though I've seen it numerous times I can't get enough. On Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his sister in the small town of Haddonfield Illinois. Now, 15 years later, he has escaped from a mental institution to reek havoc amongst the trick or treaters. Jaime Lee Curtis stars in her first role as Laurie Strode and is pursued by Michael Myers throughout the entire movie. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Myers doctor) and warns Haddonfield Police of Michael's return. Hesitant to believe the wild accusation Dr. Loomis must hunt Michael down before he can do anymore harm. Halloween will scare and delight you at the same time. The music score for Halloween is still creepy almost 25 years later and is synonymous with the movie. If you only see one horror movie in your lifetime, see this absolute classic, Halloween."
1,WARNING!,"This is the EXACT SAME DISC that was released in 1998! If you own that then you already have this disc! Do not be fooled by a fancy new slipcover! Anchor Bay is notorious for selling us all the exact same discs over and over with different covers, don't fall for it this time!"
4,We know the movie is great.. but the blu-ray is amazing.,"I love this film, I have always loved this film. What classic horror fan hasn't. But this Blu-ray takes it a step above. Looks, and sounds incredible. Everything you have always loved is here, plus more. Great extras too. If you love this film, get the Blu ray, trust me, you won't be disappointed."
5,The only good one in the series,"I'm serious Halloween 1 is the best one the only good sequel after this one was Halloween 2 there should have been No Jamie Lloyd, No Thorn story line Halloween 2 worked because it takes place on the same night as the first one did stick with this one and part 2 otherwise screw the rest"
5,correct information,I just wanted to inform the public(who probably picked up on it anyway)that there are no refrences to other horror movie's in halloween.Dr.Sam loomis is just as the name hint's at. He is the shape's doctor(not a cop).I Read ........ review and just wanted to set the record strait. All in all the best suspense/slasher movie ever to grace innocent eye's.
5,Interesting Plot,This is the first video in a set of 6 or 7. The 'Halloween' series is fantasrtic. It's about a boy who borrows a costume for trick-or-treat. This costume is evil and makes him get posessed by the devil. He starts killing people! He kills his first person by the age of 6-8. The police work on it and it goes on. Great Horror Movie!
1,Horror? I'm not so sure,"As a rabid horror fan, I've never been certain why so many other horror fans go ""ga-ga"" over this 90 minute film of predictability. It lacks any suspense. Albeit, Zombie's ""reimagining"" was MUCH worse. This film is so bland and dull. Carpenter's orchestration is the best ""thing"" to come out of this film. The characters are dull and lifeless, there is obviously NO talent involved within this film.I must say that the story written for ""Friday The 13th One"" is far superior to this jive. I simply do not like this film. The character is never given any light of purpose. Horror fans are a savvy bunch, we deserve better DEBRA HILL!"
5,One of the scariest movies ever!,"Where do I start? First off, I believe that Halloween is one of the scariest movies of all time. It practically created the slasher genre and inspired countless imitators. Unfortunately, more recent slashers, such as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, while fun to watch, are not scary at all. Halloween, on the other hand, scares me to death. What is it that makes Halloween so scary? Is it that theme music that you can't ever forget? Or is it that expressionless mask? Maybe it's the way it all looks like it could happen right in your home town. Whatever it is, no matter who you are, Halloween is one of those movies you will never forget. Watching Michael ""The Shape"" Myers slowly walk down the street is one image that will, I guarantee you, send chills down your spine."
5,AWESOME,"I can ( and HAVE ) watched this movie a MILLION times. I first saw it when I was a LITTLE girl, and it scared the bejesus out of me, and it STILL spooks me when I hear that music and see Micheal Myers casually strolling after Laurie. Great movie!!!!!!"
5,The Gone with the Wind of all Slasher Flicks.,"This is what I would like to call a perfect film. There is nothing wrong with it. The acting is natural. The cinamatography is spooky and inticing. The score is bone chilling. Everything about this film is good. Michael Myers is one of the scariest villains the movies has ever seen. Jaimie Lee Curtis did a wonderful breakout role in this film. Donald Pleasance gave the greatest performance of his career. The movie is one of the best films of the 70s and definately the greatest horror film of them all. ""every one is entitled to one good scare"""
5,"This version still slices and dices, but a little extra is thrown in the mix.","This version still slices and dices, but a little extra is thrown in the mix.Halloween needed a little more time added to be aired on NBC, so scenes were added that would also connect wit Halloween II. The additional scenes definitely add to the movie. The score doesn't leave your mind easily, and you never want to fo to the laundry room in the dark again.Oh, and it is amazing what a clothes hanger can accomplish. I am stoked I got this edition."
5,HALLOWEEN,"IT DID GREAT,ARRIVED ON TIME ,WAS IN A SHRINK WRAP,WAS SCARY.AND I GOT FREE SHIPPING ON THIS GREAT MOVIE.EXACTLY AS THE WEBSITE SHOWED.THIS THE MOVIE TO SEE ON HALLOWEEN FOREVER!!!!!!!!"
4,Never looked better,This Blu Ray is an a very good transfer taking into consideration the source and age of the film itself. Fans of Halloween shouldn't hesitate to pick this up as this is clearly how Carpenter would have intended the movie to look...and that's not a bad thing here.
5,Read this review,"This is addressed to all those who disparaged Halloween...and to explain why it is well nigh the greatest movie ever made, with Suspiria a close rival...first, the brilliant casting of Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis, and the real (sorry) star of the film, Nancy Loomis...the music is phenomenal. Really outstanding. The fright is not from seeing lots of blood (as if that's really frightening and not just unseemly), it's from the idea that on a little night in 1978 evil visited small town U.S.A. and then left as mysteriously as it came (I don't consider any of the sequels anywhere near this film at all). Evil visited Haddonfield. And sorry, the scene were Jamie enters the house and finds all her friends dead is the scariest scene ever filmed...not for shock value, but for disturbing terror. Get Halloween, love Halloween, watch it at least every October 31 - Samhain."
5,"A ""MUST-HAVE"" FOR ANY TRUE HALLOWEEN FAN!","This DVD edition of Halloween is BRILLIANT. Anchor Bay have totally redeemed themselves by re-releasing the best horror movie of all time. Their first release was badly done. This special edition is so cool. The picture is THX and is so clear (you would think the movie was filmed in the last few years - the only thing that dates it is the clothing/hairstyles etc). The sound (if you are watching with a Dolby Digital receiver) is amazing. The extra features are excellent - a 30 minute documentary that has been very well done with interviews, footage of the locations as they are now and how they made the movie), over 100 behind the scenes photos. It is an excellent DVD and worth the money. Thanks Anchor Bay for re-releasing this classic horror movie!"
4,HALLOWEEN,"this is by far John Carpenters best movie.A psychotic killer escapes from a mental hospital and returns to his old neighborhood, He begins stalking local teenage girls untill he strikes with a vengeance during Halloween night. Very scary with lots of suspense. Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie is terrific as the killers prime target,Donald Pleasence as DR. Loomis is good as the psychiatrist hunting his patient and pj soles as Lynda standsout amongst the rest of the actors."
3,Halloween Is Awesome! But what's with the Stupid Widescreen?,"Halloween is an awesome movie. But one thing I find really stupid is the widescreen (2.35:1 ratio) meaning if you dont have a widescreen tv, the picture will come up with humongous black bars along the top and bottom of the screen, making it halfscreen. I would rather see the whole picture instead of half!"
5,"""GREAT""",This movie was amazing. I read another reviewer that said the movie had no plot. I partly agree. BUT I was wrong. In Haloween 6 it explains that Michael Meyers was tormented into killing his family so the movie has a very good plot.I rate 5 stars.
5,ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME!,"HALLOWEEN IS MY SECOND FAVORITE HORROR MOVIE(PSYCHO IS MY FIRST). IT'S VERY SCARY AND TERRIFYING! I WAS SO SCARED THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS MOVIE. MICHAEL MYERS IS AN EXCELLENT KILLER, AND JAMIE LEE CURTIS IS AWESOME IN THIS MOVIE. SO ARE HER FRIENDS AND DR. LOOMIS. THE CHASE SCENE AT THE END IS ONE OF THE BEST MOMENTS OF HORROR HISTORY! I TOTALLY RECOMMENED THIS EDGE OF YOUR SEAT THRILLER!"
5,Good Scary Movie,This movie is scary. It is better than any other scary movie I have ever seen. It is an older movie but the older the better in my opinion.
2,Not a Fan of the Re-mastered version,"I really like the original ""Halloween"" in all it's 70s glory so when I went off to college that was one of the movies I had to have. So just to let you know my review is not about the movie but how it was re-mastered.I HATE THIS DIGITALLY MASTERED VERSION!!!On the back it says ""This is Halloween like you've never SEEN or heard it before!""That's true... You can't SEE anything! Everything is so dark and smooth looking.And seeing that a lot of the scenes happen at night, if you haven't seen this movie before you would be totally lost!The sound quality is good and I do like the Special Features. But overall not happy with this buy.If anyone knows of a Halloween DVD that's not re-mastered let me know."
3,"Great Movie, Poor Product","As for the Halloween movie itself it deserves 5/5 stars. However for this BluRay edition I have to give it 3 stars because nothing special is included, the insert isn't anything either, and the blue ""hue"" lighting that looks amazing at the end has been removed from the film completely. That was an awesome part of the film for me. It really made the film feel spooky. Other then that, the transfer is beautiful. I just hope in the future there is a better release for this movie on Blu Ray that includes a good insert, special features, and the blue lighting. Oh, and I got it for $5 at Walmart."
2,Not needed extra scenes,"The reason I gave this two stars is: When you origanlly watch a movie and you enjoy it, then they add extra scenes to fit a time slot on T.V. it is like they tainted the first version.(in my humble opinion) That is why I rated it two stars... I am however a huge halloween fan (except for number three), watching this is still better than most horror flicks."
2,Rick,This is not at all what we thought it was. The first three movies are same. 1 is a Blue-Ray. 2 is a DVD version of the original film. 3 is an Extended Version. 4 is a documentry Disc. 5 is Holloween 4 and disc 5 is Holloween 5. So we are missing movies 2 and 3. We thought we were getting the first six films. MY BAD.... Don't waste your money if you think your getting the first six films !!!
5,happy halloween,"Was looking for this movie for Halloween. Was $10 or more in stores.Found it here brand new,never opened for $7. Movie arrived quickly and in excellent condtion just in time for halloween.Would do business with them again."
1,Not a good movie,"The most overrated horror movie ever,Michael Myers kills his sister and on Halloween 1978,he returns to kill his other sister Laurie a babysitter,she must protect her kid she is babysitting before Michael kills them both.The plot is original and the movie dosen't need gore to be scary,but this boring low budget mess is not worth it,The Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition DVD is alright but lacking deleted scenes.Don't waste your money on a rental or buying."
1,Pointless,"I'm sorry but I just don't see why everybody loves this movie. Don't get me wrong, I love horror movies, but Halloween is just pointless. I just can't get into a movie where the killer can't die. They've got to have some sort of weakness. I could hardly stay awake for this film. Personally I like horror movies like Evil Dead, The Re-Animator, and Suspiria a lot better than this ..."
2,"Oh, please!!","I know Halloween is a classic, but it would be nice if it was a good classic. This is the second worst movie I've ever seen(the worst is Friday The 13th). I like to watch horror movies but watching this is just a wast of time. Almost the whole movie is boring, it's not scary at all and it's just very poorly made. If you want something scary go buy The Amityville Horror, that movie is good. Halloween does not deserve to be a classic, so don't waste your time and money!"
1,Hmmmm... Let's talk about Halloween!,"Everybody says that this is such a good movie. I heard that this is better than Halloween H20. Well, that's good, but this isn't. I'm sorry, but I don't like this!"
2,A very overrated movie.,"I don't understand what people saw in this movie. I bought the movie because it was cheap and I was looking for a good horror movie to add to my collection because I am a big fan of the genre. However, the movie itself was a huge disappointment. It was very slow moving, not scary and overall, the plot was weak. It basically is about a mass murdering other worldly person named Micheal Myers who goes around and slaughters people for no reason but to kill. Not only are there not many kills but hardly anything happens in this movie and it was just very boring. There was almost no action except for the final encounter at the end. Critics said this was one of the best and most scariest horror movies made. They were dead wrong. To name anything positive about the film, I liked Micheal Myers theme song but that's it."
4,halloween o god make the series stop!,"halloween was not a bad movie for its time and i expected them to make a few more but now, they have pushed it way too far. Forget the sequels, Halloween is a timeless classic."
5,HALLOWEEN,THIS IS A MUST HAVE COMPLETE SET FOR THE MICHAEL MYERS FAN. YOU GET EVERY DVD THAT WAS PRODUCED IN THE HALLOWEN SERIES ALL IN ONE COMPLETE PACKAGE. IT IS TRULY A MUST HAVE!!
4,One of the original slasher movies,Halloween is a great one to get you in the mood for Halloween. It has some comic relief. Jamie lee Curtis was perfect in her role. I has become a tradition to watch on Halloween for me.
2,Anchor Bay should recall this edition & correct the tranfer,"I have the prior limited edition from 1999, which includes a very nice transfer indeed. I bought this edition for the commentary, but was also expecting an improved transfer, given the comments on the front of the disc. Nope. It's a loser. What a shame that they couldn't get the color timing right or improve on their prior four-year-old edition. Very hard to understand given the popularity of this title.."
3,Making you pay yet again,"Here's another reason to get annoyed with the way they release movies on tape and DVD. How many versions of Halloween will they keep coming out with?This movie has one thing going for it: the 10 extra minutes of footage. The material was shot in 81 while they were shooting Halloween II because they needed extra footage for the TV version which was cut under time. So they wove a plot twist--the Michael Meyers/Laurie Strode sibling relation between them which is actually key to the neverending legacy of the series.And that's it. Wasn't this material already included on the limited Halloween DVD? And why don't they just put all this stuff on one disc--it's 10 extra minutes.Not worth it. There's a scene of Loomis pleading with the medical board to keep Michael Meyer's in maximum security. Then the shot of the hospital room with the word ""sister"" written on the wall. Buy the theatrical edition with the documentary and the better sound mixes."
5,You will never forget it....,"I have yet to find a movie that instilled as much fear in me as the orginal story of Michael Myers. This movie is not about the gore snf blood we so often see in movies these days, yet, it scares you to the core. Michael Myers is more than just a killer, he is a fear that stays inside you. Run all you want, he will walk and he will find you. You can't overcome his strength. This movie will make you look behind you to make sure nobody is following you, and trust me, you will not want to be in your home alone after watching this. This is a classic and will always be. By Far the best horror movie ever"
5,Halloween is the greatest horror movie ever.,"Halloween was and still is the greatest horror movie ever. John Carpenter did a brilliant job executing(heh heh) this masterpiece.While I love the Limited Edition version I found a couple of minor things about this version I didn't like. I didn't like the scratchy loud music in the sudden shock scenes. Also I wouldn't have made it widescreen because I prefer fullscreen and I thought the fullscreen view was a lot better. But I loved the Halloween: Unmasked segments, trailers and the TV scenes but I would have put them in the movie.If I were you I wouldn't miss this, but I don't know how many are left."
4,Halloween,"On Halloween 1963, Haddenfield, 10-year-old Michael Myers, estranged and mentally unstable, is imprisoned in Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis for the murders of his mother's boyfriend, his older sister, and her boyfriend. Now, 16 years later, he escapes and now in search of his baby sister Laurie and Dr. Loomis must warn the residents of Haddenfield and get to Laurie before Michael does. This movie does make for a very admirable companion piece to a horror classic, blending the old and the new into an entertaining and thought-provoking fright movie."
1,Buy the Divimax version instead!,"Do not waste your time purchasing this unless you want an inferior version! The divimax version is far superior to this. It is slightly more expensive though, so unless you don't care about owning the best possible version available on DVD then this version should be an option.This has been about the sixth time Anchor Bay has released this movie, and the same amount of times that I've purchased it. I've never been disappointed with the new version they put out, until now! As soon as I started watching it I realized it was very inferior to the version I've been watching the last couple of years - the Divimax version.So leave it up to what your DVD standards are and purchase this version to save some $ and get a decent looking version, or buy theHalloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)and own a great quality DVD with plenty of features!J"
2,Love the movie but...,"First, let me say that I love ""Halloween"" so this review is not about the movie itself.I purchased this DVD new. Upon inspection, both discs appeared to have bounced around the case many times. Both discs were scratched and stained and even appeared to have fingerprints on them. The center disc holder was broken on both sides, which may account for the disc damage.I am playing the movie as I write this and it appears that it is in acceptable shape. However, when you purchase something ""new"", you expect ""new"" quality.I love the movie. I hate the fact that my product was damaged and, possibly, used."
2,The mother of slasher films?,"This one is definitley the mother of slasher films. But why? This movie is packed with cheap acting, dull score, bad editing, and a real no- good thrills. I appreiciate John Carpenter's work, but it's so overrated! One of the most overrated films I've seen. But the thing I liked is that scenes that you can see in Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, or other slasher flix were started in this film. For example, when Mike Meyers was wounded, Jamie Lee Curtis looked around towards another place and when he looked at the place where Mike Meyers was lying down, he's not there! Nice try Carpenter, but sorry for giving you 2 stars!"
2,Not the best.,"This Halloween movie is the one that started it all. It was okay. The effects were fake. I personally don't think it was so good. Halloween 2 was a little better, but Halloween 4 was the one that really started it all!"
2,An Obvious Marketing Ploy,"I'm into everything having to do with Halloween. But there's no way I'd pay this much (fiddy bucks) for this ""Package""."
1,New Halloween Release with Only 91 Minutes!,"It appears that this release is simply the theatrical version of the movie, which I can't say I prefer. I really enjoyed the extra material that they shot for the television release, which puts it at 104 minutes as opposed to 91 minutes of the theatrical version. For me, thus far, the only good version of Halloween on DVD came when they released the extended version on DVD some time ago. With it, it included the R-version of the film, which is discernable by watching the opening scene with Michael in the mask, with no edit and overlayed template to mask his sisters breasts as he brings the knife down. I am sure the new release will be welcomed by some, due to the new transfer and captioning, but I can't say that I will be buying this one."
4,Great Scary Movie,"It's not the camera work or the lines, it's the quiet streets that hide the mayhem of a small town. Donald Pleasance was great in this film, read his bio, very interesting, WWII POW."
5,The BEST version yet!!,"Please don't let the picky whiners deter you from picking up this amazing set. It has the sharpest and best picture quality of any previous release! The ""concerns"" over some minor color differences have been WAY overblown! Everyone who knows anything about this movie knows that it WASN'T shot in the fall...it is obvious regardless of which version you choose to view. But what is better besides the sharp picture quality is the commentary and the extras that are included. If you a call yourself a Halloween fan, don't be a fool...buy this NOW!"
3,"GREAT FILM, TERRIBLE DVD","The three star rating only applies to the DVD, not the film which should get five stars.It is a shame that this really great horror classic was so poorly transfered to DVD. The picture is dark, and seems out of focus. Also, it has no extra features, just the trailer. I agree with the previous viewer who wrote that you'd be better off with the VHS version. One of the few cases where a DVD has gone wrong"
4,"A real ""treat"" for fans...","This double disc set is well worth the money for fans as it provides a bevy of promotional material for the first film, info about why the television version is different, and best of all, a nice clean print.While it might have been better (and cost effective) for some to have had the eleven minutes of footage filmed for NBC simply placed in an outtake section, providing a second disc with the scenes incorporated into the movie (and the stuff NBC didn't want taken out) makes for an interesting comparison, turning the film into a more psychological film than horror.All in all, it makes a worthy purchase for hard core fans of the film who want both the elusive t.v. version and a great presentation of the original (the ""making-of"" documentary is wonderful).On a side note -- is it just me or are there a lot of leaves still on the trees on Halloween night in Haddonfeld? And none of them have changed color! I love stuff like that...Enjoy!"
3,This orgional DVD release willnot play sound,"The movie is a Halloween Classic, however only the video trailer would play sound. I tried 3 different copies on 2 different Sony 3000 Model DVD players and got the same resultes. Im hopefull and the new limited release has this corrected."
1,Bad News!,"I always loved the Halloween movies. The problem with the 25th anniversary DVD is, it doesn't have any of the original edited seens. There is about 10 minutes that has been cut from the movie.(very important parts). All of my other DVD's have the outtakes from the original movies. I don't understand why they didn't include these in the 25th anniversary edition. Without them, there is no understanding the movie at all. It's just another slasher movie with no plot. I was very disappointed. It's not worth the money that they are selling it for."
1,The night THEY cashed in!,"OK, I LOVE Halloween, it remains to this day as one of my favorite movies to date. I have both the 1978 and 2007 versions. I have the latest DVD of the 1978 version, and I am happy enough with that one as it is. But this set it $70 for something you already own as well as not H2 but 4 and 5. C'mon, Mr. Carpenter. I already own a DVD of your classic horror masterpiece, I DON'T NEED ANOTHER ONE. You're becoming just as bad as George Lucas and the Star Wars movies. Simply put, this doesn't bring ANYTHING new to the table. It's just another case of Anchor Bay going through the motions because it's time to make more $$$ again. Quite frankly, if you already own the movie, you don't need to buy this."
3,"DISAPPOINTING, but still entertaining","Well, I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this, but I just don't see what all the hype is about concerning Halloween. Yes, it is well crafted, and yes, for it's time it was scary. But it is also EXTREMELY slow and plodding, with countless shots of Mike just shambling around, stalking Jaime. Get to the point! It seems as if John Carpenter wanted to go for an atmosphere of dread and horror, but I believe that other movies (which were made either during or before that time) were better at it, like Suspiria and Night of the Living Dead. The film is too routinely paced and routinely directed to stand out in the viewer's mind, and really is nowhere as scary as its reputed to be. Give it a shot, but just don't be surprised if you aren't as blown away (or scared) as everyone said you would be."
5,The Ultimate in Terror,"I know everyone that is in to the horror genre has seen this movie. This movie, by far, is the most suspenseful and scary movie ever released. If you notice, while you're watching this movie, the abscence of blood, guts, and cheap tricks to keep you watching. John Carpenter does a great job of keeping you on the edge of you seat with background music and a story line that was new at the time of the picture. I know some horror fans think that the Friday The 13th Movie was the movie that started it all but that is nothing compaired to the actual fear and suspence that one will watching Halloween."
5,A classic in every sense!,"Let me first start out by saying please disregard everything written by that reviewer before me. Obviously (s)he has no idea what a good movie, good acting or good directing is all about. Either that or they must've seen another movie.John Carpenter is one of the best known directors in the annals of horror movie history and did a phenomenal job of making one of the most suspenseful and influential horror films in the genre's history. If there was a horror movie hall of fame. Carpenter would be inducted first ballot along with the character Michael Myers. Halloween is not just for horror fans, it's a well acted suspenseful roller coaster that is made even more effective by the incredible score (done by Carpenter himself)If you haven't seen Halloween I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who loves a good, gripping suspenseful movie. One other thing to the reviwer before me (ever heard of Jamie Lee Curtis??)"
2,Bad print of a great movie.,"Be warned, the remastering of the movie might be crystal clear, but it completely erased the wonderful use of the colors blue and orange in Dean Cundy's photography. No amount of extras are worth a washed out print."
5,Orginal!,This movie is my favorite movie of all time. It is very original and has an amazing storyline. Halloween is my favorite movie/horror movie. This is a MUST see for all horror movie fans. Buy this for this halloween to watch.
3,good,"I thought this movie was a good classic. the story plot was pretty good and the acting was ok. the movie didnt have any blood and it has some nudity in it. the movie needed abit more action in it, mostly it just showed myers stand in one place and disapear. if you like slasher movies, then rent or buy this."
2,Disappointing Set,"I was anticipating on this set even though I have every one of the Halloween movies on DVD. I was hoping for a complete set but I guess that's not possible since Anchor Bay don't own the rights to Halloween II or H20. Most of all what's even MORE DISAPPOINTING is the fact that Anchor Bay have released Halloween so many times and they still don't even release the original movie and the Extended aka as the TV Version with [CC] CLOSED CAPTIONING for the Deaf & Hearing Impaired or have any SUBTITLES, even Halloween BLURAY is not [CC] or subtitles. Anchor Bay seem to be lazy and not release a proper release with extras, an uncut version or extra footage along with everything CLOSED CAPTION... I wish they get it right for once and quit do with the lazy and quick put together set, believe me the mask and box set idea is pretty lame and an embarrassment."
3,Horror,"This movie is truly a classic horror movie from Director John Carpenter but,although the sequels were many the remake (Uncut Version) by Director Rob Zombie at least explains the why for Michael Meyers insanity with causes from parental abuse & bullying by his peers and sister."
5,"Not afraid to say, this was a great buy!",My daughter was disapointed after an in-store purchase. She was left hanging after paying a big price for a Halloween special trilogy that didn't contain the original movie with Jamie Lee Curtis.
2,"""Kane Hodder should have played Michael...""","Well, I liked the music in it, it was really good, but, sadly, it lacks a lot of Michael Myers. What I mean is, it doesn't show his face/mask a lot. Plus, Michael Myers is just plain looking, Jason and Freddy are more dead and scarier than this. But, the score was great, and the whole concept was good. Another thing, the body count was too low! Jason usually takes out 10 to 20 people in every one of his movies. And plus, Michael Myers should have been played by Kane Hodder, than he would have been a lot creepier than whoever plays Myers now. Jamie Lee Curtis was an extremely bad actor, and her voice was just too manly! So, I'd really only recommend this because you need to watch it to understand the whole concept and because it has an excellent score, but if you understand the whole thing already (I mean, before seeing any of the movies) than do not watch this."
4,"Fair transfer of film, however laserdisc is better...","Colour transfer was fine, and the monoral sound was crisp, however the Criterion laserdisc was much better with it's essential goodies attached. Apparently another totally new 5.1 channel DVD collector's edition is soon to be released."
5,BEST scary movie ever,"this was the scariest movie ever,if i would i would give it 10 starsDaniel Leahy"
5,THE BEST,"You CANNOT go wrong with this. If you are looking for something creepy, evil, and disturbing, this is it. No other horror movie can compare with this."
5,Halloween is the face of Horror,"Halloween, simply put is the best horror film of all time. It is an original idea that works. I found even the theme music to be quite moving, it sent chills down my spine. Who would of thought that shere evil could enable a six year old boy to slaughter his sister. This movie is brilliantly acted as well. Jamie-Lee Curtis is and will ever be the original scream queen. There is so many things to say about the movie that have already been said. So in these words I will say - Halloween is a merciless horror film that takes you for a ride and will never let go! a 11 out of 10 hit! My favourite film."
1,Took away directors vision,"Scenes in other dvd releases of Halloween had blue tint to them. The movie also had a fall season look to it. Anchor Bay messed up once again. Sure the picture is sharper, but all the blue tint has been washed out. For example there is a scene where we see a door which is tinted blue, now the door is more white and shows no blue at all. There are a lot more scenes like this as well. The fall season look is gone too. Anchor Bay now has all the grass looking bright green. For them to change the classic vision of the movie is pathetic. The only reason anyone should buy this is because of the extras. If you want the movie with a great transfer check out the LE or the restored version. This supposedly great dvd also does not have the extended version. WAY TO GO ANCHOR BAY!"
1,"Great movie, terrible transfer to High Definition","This review is for the high definition disc only. This is a really good movie that is one of the standards of excellence for very low budget motion pictures, but this high definition transfer is unwatchable. The colors are ugly and wrong. In addition, the excessive use of digital grain reduction technology has both softened the picture and robbed it of much of the detail in the image. Looks like something that was done by amateurs on a home system. Extremely poor and should be avoided -- The worst transfer to high def disc that I have seen."
2,OVER RATED,cmon r u serious. greatest horror movie ever my ass. it was prolly good in 78 but it doesnt compare 2 some of the movies today. i meen all the reviews for scream said it was pathetic but it sure was a hell of a lot better than this. i thought it was scarier than this 2 and it wasnt that scary itself.
1,SCREWED IT UP,"Buyer Beware! This edition is hideous. The extras are good, but the actual film has been butchered. The colors are all wrong.. I could go on & on. Anchor Bay should just re-release the 2 disc special edition & be done with it! Stay away from this one-- try the previous edition instead."
2,Overrated...,"I watched the 1978 film ""Halloween"" a while ago and was thoroughly disappointed in it. It's not scary, it's slow moving and there's basically no plot whatsoever. It rips off of 'The Exorcist' (vastly superior to this film). The detective in this movie is a complete knock-off of the detective in 'The Exorcist', (same accents, same appearance). Overall, ""Halloween"" is pretty, well, hollow. Give it a rent if you're a horror buff."
1,this has to be the most suspenseful horror movie ever!,"This movie is great. It is highly terrifying, highly suspenseful, and has an engrossing plot. That of a child killer, put in an asylum for the criminally insane, escaping, and going back to the hometown he came from to seek revenge and recompensation. The methods and ways he kills in many ways seem to almost bring out the fear of ""what if..."" one of the childhood killers of this day were to get out. Its over 20 years old but it is the BEST in the series (I have seen them all)"
3,Disappointed,"I like the Halloween story line. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. However, I was disappointed that it shows nudity. One of the girls boobs are showing several times. Why Hollywood thinks they have to put nudity in all the time is beyond me. I think it ruins the film. Otherwise, it's a great horror flick. Love the theme song. It is so fitting."
5,The first horror film to keep me awake,"This little horror film came out back in 1978 and scared the hell out of almost everyone who saw it back then and it continues to scare people today.It scared me so bad I couldn't sleep for two months.Great directing,acting,great and creepy score and most of all one scary character Michael Myers."
4,Great slasher,"This movie is legendary and very influential. The style is great, music adds to the tension, and I like the killer's eye view from behind the mask, that was brilliant. The trip to the mental hospital was scary, from then on you know nobody is safe. The last half of the movie is very well done, Michael Myers is no Jason Voorhees but he can still cause a lot of mayhem. Part 2 is just as good."
5,scary fun,It is a great movie to watch in the dark.I first saw it on halloween night 2004 and i loved it.It would have been better if they hadnt shown us mikes face.
1,Utterly Ridiculous,"Anyone who thinks this is a ""definitive"" version or a ""director's cut"" is sadly misinformed. For the record, Carpenter filmed these 'extra' scenes for tv as the censors had cut so much material from the theatrical release that it wouldn't fill the necessary time-slot. That's why the 'new' scenes are not widescreen. Furthermore, and more importantly, Carpenter has said that he HATES these scenes. Just his to his own words on the Criterion LaserDisc commentary. That this version is marketed and hyped is pathetic."
3,A great young upstart by Jamie Lee Curtis!,"A good slasher film that started the series of other ones(and influenced others as well) A definete cult classic! Of course this isn't Jamie Lee Curtis' first taste in acting(I saw her guest star in an episode of the Nancy Drew Mysteries, which was made a year and a half before the release of this movie). Other slasher films that carried on the tradition like this one are Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, and Scream!Curtis, 20 years later, returned to finally kill Michael Myers, but none of them are as good as this one.I always watch this one close to Halloween!"
5,Best Horror Movie Ever!,"This is the best horror movie of all time. The gorgeous graphics the PSP gives the movie is outstanding. I am a true fan of Halloween. I own them all, including number 3, which has no reference of Michael Myers. I love the fact that I can watch my favorite movie on the go! Granted this Halloween isn't graphic like its prequel done by Rob Zombie, the bone chilling factor of having someone stalk you without you knowing is scary enough to freak the heck out of me now as it did when I first saw it in the late 80's. Awesome Movie!!!"
3,"The Boogie Man, Scary stuff","The landmark horror classic that lauched the slasher movie & introduced Jamie Lee Curtis is a terrifying scene to scene creeper, a nightmarish classic, a thrill ride to strike terror in those who watch it, see John Carpenter's ""HALLOWEEN"""
5,If u are a fan u will GET THIS...,"So we have all the halloween movies more than once. So this set does not include parts 2,3,6,7,8. So there are no damn...extras ?SO WHAT THE HECK ?It's michael myers babe in a new collectable dvd box set and I'M GONNA BUY IT NO MATTER WHAT cause babes MICHAEL is the most famous horror icon together with FREDDY, JASON and...CHUCKY (LOL) and everyone who considers himself a horror fan has ALL 11 F13 MOVIES, ALL 9 HALLOWEEN MOVIES, ALL 8 NOES MOVIES AND ALL 5 CHILD'S PLAY MOVIES.WHAT ? THERE'S A NEW HALLOWEEN BOX SET IN THE MARKET ? BRING IT ON..."
1,Where's the plot???,"I thought movies were supposed to have little things called ""plots."" Well, Halloween has absolutely *no* plot whatsoever. The film is downright boring. The first hour of the film is sooooo boring and slow. The last hour isn't exciting, but it is more suspenseful than the first 60 minutes of the film. I was surprised at how much nudity there was in this film as well. I can't imagine a mother (or father) letting their child watch this film. It's gruesome and demented. I did not like one single solitary thing about Halloween. I do not recommend it at all."
2,Not the best way to start a trend...,"I did not like this film. In fact, I found it to be one of the worst of the famed slashers. It was not at all scary, nor did it have many creative kills (there was one, in particular, that I did like though). I guess at its time, just people getting murdered was scary enough, but not in today's world. Also, Michael Myers is not supernatural, so why does he not die? He just keeps coming back to a point of redundancy. Its just dumb and predictably pointless. A cliffhanger ending is an alright lead into the next film, which, I must say, is a much better movie than its predecessor."
3,Halloween,"A good way to start this franchise. chilling story about killer believed to be pure evil escaping from mental hospital after killing his older sister as a kid. The plot focuses on him trailing after his sister played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Donald Pleasance does a wonderful job as Michael's doctor. One of the more successful horror franchises, but sorry, it and michael do not compare to Friday the 13th and Jason Voorhees. Although it is one of the 3 best series.(the other being Freddy and A Nightmare on Elm Street series)"
3,Slasher.,"This is probably the prototype slasher movie. It's slow moving, but somewhat atmospheric. It's a movie one should have seen, but it's not quite as good as it's reputation."
4,This DVD is good but there is something you all should know!,This only has the TV version in Dolby 2.O mono sound. The 2 disc set collectors edition that is now out of print came with this TV version in Dolby 2.O mono sound plus the other disc was the normal version in an OUTSTANDING Dolby 5.1 digital remaster. I have seen the extra footage on the tv version disc but I always watch the regular version because the sound is really great. It sounds like a brand new movie. Yes this new version is good but it is a shame they left out the new enhanced version of the film. That is why I give it 4 out of 5 stars. But I read somewhere that a new 25th aniversary edition is going to be put out next year and I bet they make it a 2 disc set or at least have the Dolby 5.1 theatrical version in the set. I also read that it will have a directors comentary on it! HALLOWEEN FANS just hold out a little longer for this version to come out so you have both versions of this great horror classic. TRUST ME ON THIS!
5,One of the greatest Horror Classics!,"I love this movie, The one that started the Halloween series franchise! All Horror Movie fans should have this in their collection!"
5,Guerilla filming at it's finest,"This is how horror movies should be done. It is just freaky. I mean, Michael Myers himself is scary. I love Jamie Lee Curtis. She is a really good actress and is amazingly great for this being her first movie. Don't watch it with the lights off!"
4,The Night HE came home...,This is absolutely the best in the series. It's about the night HE came home and he does it with a style. I really admire how wisely Michael Myers kills all the witnesses around his sister Laurie Strode... and then we see this little domestic quarrell wich makes this movie woth of 4 stars. Just take my simple advice: Buy it.
3,"Good, but not Great","This conclusion to the Lear family trilogy is good, as London is a fun and fresh writer with great characterization and hip storytelling. Perhaps I didn't personally relate as well to Rachel as the other two sisters, and could not get into the witchcraft part of the story at all.London's ""brit-speak"" for the character Flynn is funny and witty, and I loved the way she continued the story of Bonnie and Aaron and neatly tied in the other sisters and grandparents. If you enjoyed the first two, then you should read this, but you just may not re-read it as many times as ""Material Girl"" and ""Beauty Queen""."
1,Disappointing painful drivel,I am generally a Julia London fan. I found this book to be painful in the extreme to get thru. It's slow and plodding Rachel is annoying and takes being a doormat to an entirely new level.
2,Better than the 2nd =/,"Ugh Rachel Lear.... I get what London was trying to do but it didn't work. She tried so hard to make her the likeable, youngest child that she made her into a pushover. I wanted to slap her, tell her to stand up for herself and stop eating brownies. The witchcraft angle was old after the first one, and they proceed to do several more after. My pet peeve with writers is when they just want you to buy a romantic spark by just writing it. That's just being lazy. I don't see why either of them liked each other. The ending was anticlimatic, the plot predictable, the characters blah, and yet I still liked it better than the second Rebecca Lear story."
2,The writing's good but the heroine in TSTL...,"After reading Ms. London's BEAUTY QUEEN, I was anxious to read MISS FORTUNE. However, the book just never caught on with me and the heroine is definitely someone I wouldn't want to know or be. I have a problem with romance novel heroines who are in their 30's and still living off their parents yet get angry when their life goals, etc. are questioned. After a while I gave up on Rachel and wondered what anyone would see in her. She really had no redeeming values. I did like the book's hero more and loved how Ms. London used a lot of British slang with this character. I found him charming, but once again, couldn't see what he saw in his lady love."
1,"After 50 pages, I skipped to the end","I was so dissapointed by this book! I read the first two and thought while they were not up to Julia London's previous books, they were light airplane reads. After 50 pages of Rachel not doing anything but letting her friends use her and eat, I was bored, bored, bored.I only skimmed throught to see her parents moving forward.I do not recommend this book at all!"
2,"Meaningless, without a center, disappointing","Leonard's style is to create strong, engaging characters and ""see what happens."" This story has neither interesting characters, nor does very much happen. Leonard is also famous for looking into the lives of petty crooks - but these are among the pettiest. A couple of selfish and self-indulgent losers get their kicks throwing rocks through the windows of homes. The readers are invited to giggle with glee at the stupid fools who live within, and stumble into the night to see what has happened. I tossed this book after reading the first half - a first for me. I have read every Elmore Leonard I could get my hands on. But this one, I couldn't wait get rid of. Skip this book."
3,"Elmore, entertaining as always","Jack Ryan is a small-time migrant worker/burgular/baseball player who's never accomplished much, aside from getting arrested a couple of times and finding a job as a hotel handyman. Nancy Hayes is a rich man's girlfriend who's made a life out of taking advantage of men and whose idea of a good time is shooting out windows and running people off the road. When the two of them get together, Nancy sees a guy who can help her latest boyfriend pay off, while Jack just sees someone attractive and interesting, but whom he can't quite figure out.It's hard not to like any of Elmore Leonard's books; the characters are always shady, the plots are always interesting, and the dialogue is always fantastic. The Big Bounce is no different, though the ending is a little odd. This isn't Leonard's best book, but it's still entertaining and a pretty quick read. If you like Leonard's other work, you won't be disappointed with this book."
2,Lesser Leonard,"I am an avid Elmore Leonard fan and have lost count of the number of books of his that I have read. Some of them rank with the best crime fiction ever written. However, this is not one of them. In fact, this is the first one I have read that is actually bad. The main problem is the very thin plot, which Leonard all too frequently compensates for with flashbacks to the character's earlier life, which have nothing whatever to do with the plot. It is obvious that he does this just to fill space and stretch this short story out to book length.That having been said, I must say that I liked the book's ending. It was surprising and abrupt. But this book is only for Dutch-ophiles who may be curious to see what the master's early work was like."
4,A gripping story by a great storyteller,"Dutch Leonard doesn't like to let you relax. He keeps you wondering if Jack Ryan is a bad guy or a good guy with some bad habits. Every time you begin to get comfortable with the direction of the story, a new twist triggers the anxiety attack that won't allow you to set it down. And then there's Nancy, I've known a few like her and she's downright scary. A book that will genuinely hold your interest."
3,"Two good characters, Plot doesn't hold together","Elmore Leonard has done much better than this and I am usually a big fan. Jack Ryan and Nancy Hayes are two very good characters and are well developed.Unfortunately, a lot of Elomore Leonard's usual humor is missing from this book. Somehow the pacing seems off as well.Leonard's ability to find distinct locations for his capers and describe them well works here as usual. I would never have suspected that cucumber farms and Michigan beach vacation spots for a crime novel"
2,Nothing too exciting...,"A bit slower than what I expected. I was more interested in the quick flashback sequences between Jack Ryan and Leon Woody. It was entertaining, but slowed to the pace of a geriatric bingo game, at times. The plot's not too engaging, but Leonard's knack for writing from a character's point of view keeps you amused.I'd recommend ""Maximum Bob"" as my favorite Leonard book, so far.A sidenote, but Detroit Tiger fans may get a kick out of the last few chapters."
2,What happened to the ending?,"I am an avid Elmore Leonard fan. While this book is dated, the basic premise of the story had all the traditional earmarks of a Leonard novel.Once the book begins hitting the climax, the book takes a totally different direction. The main storyline is aborted.I was listening to an unabridged audio version of this book. I returned the book to Amazon since I thought I had an incomplete book. The book ended on the 5th tape with no warning that it was complete. A sixth tape was added which started with an Elmore Leonard short story that was included in a previous book.Don't waste your time with this book."
2,Where's the ending?,"There is no real ending in this book. After the reading the last chapter the book leaves you asking yourself, then what? The characters are interesting and Nancy is surely a woman to stay away from and not unlike some women I have known in my lifetime. Your led to believe in the book that the climatic scene will have something to do with the theft of a large amount of money that they have been talking about for half of the book, but it ends with indecision about the heist and it leaves the reader clueless about several points."
1,Cheap,"Stay away from these. I bought them on amazon because of the reviews on here. Do not be tricked. They are simply cheap stop watches that break right away. You get what you pay for. If you just want something cheap for one-time use only, then maybe buy them. Otherwise, if you want something to last more than a month, buy a quality stopwatch."
5,Joyous and Inspiring and a Great Gift,"The audio version of this book is so well read -- it is well worth the cost. You cannot help feeling cheerful and energized about your own life, as you hear it. I gave the paperback version to a couple of discouraged women friends who prefer to read rather than listen to books. Both women loved it, and were inspired to face their own hardships more buoyantly. The very gifted author has blessed us with a wonderful history and narrative!"
5,Letters of a Woman Homesteader,"Nice read. This is the kind of book that just cannot be laid down. Well written. The description of the landscape is excellent, makes one feel as if there are there among the homesteaders."
4,Window to the past,"This book was great, the author obviously had amazing courage and a real zest for life along with an exceptionally positive attitude.If you want to know something about the life and times of pioneers to the west than this is a real window. I had to keep checking it wasn't a novel at first, quite an adventure. Enjoy."
4,Good book,Very good book. WAS easy to read. I really enjoy reading about the past and she paints a really good picture of the surroundings.
4,A Personal View of History,"This first person account of homesteading in Wyoming in the early 1900s is both interesting and enjoyable. The attitude and spirit of the writer and the characters she describes tells you a lot about the people who not only lived, but thrived settling the most remote corners of this nation."
4,Letters of a Woman Homesteader,Letters of a Woman Homesteader is an amazing book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I especially like being able to get free books and reading them on my Kindle app. I like books that have some historical value to them.
4,Letters of a Woman Homesteader,"This was a fun read. Not too long and it often made you laugh but did end quite abruptly. Reminds me of ""These is My Words"". Good, creative 'jourmal writing'!"
3,Letters of a Woman Homesteader,This was about her life so it was as interesting as it could be. lA fun read for someone who can put it down and continue later.
4,Interesting accounting,"I enjoyed this woman's accounting of her life as a homestead. I especially enjoyed the Christmas story. It is hard to imagine what homesteaders endured, but E. Stewart gives a very clear picture of the hardships and the joys. A good read for anyone interested in this type of history."
4,Did you grow up reading On The Banks of Plum Creek?,"This is the story of a widowed mother heading west and finding ways to like what she's made of her life. A good, satisfying read by and about the kind of person I'd like to know."
5,Wonderful and highly recommended,"This was a great peek into the life of a woman homesteader. I was delighted to see (through Ms. Pruitt's writings) how many other women homesteaders there were in that time. She has such an engaging writing style and it kept me riveted for the entire collection of letters.By chance I noticed that one of the films on my netflix list is called Heartland. It's a movie from 1980 whose main character, Elinor, is based on these writings. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie even more after reading these letters.If you like smart, spunky, DIY characters, you'll love Ms. Pruitt's writings."
1,letters of a woman homesteader,I found this to be boring and slow moving. I kept waiting for interest to build but gave up. I would not recommend it.
5,i can't put it down,"this is a book that completely took me by surprise. i wanted to read it from a historic perspective, but came away with deep respect for the woman who was self-educated and found the time to forge deep friendships and to write these amazing letters. it was educational, but painlessly so."
4,Engrossing,"Captivating read of a woman determining her own destiny. Hard work and hard ""play"" gave Elinore a gloriously fulfilled life. Her interest in people made great stories. Kept me engrossed no matter what was going on about me."
5,Entertaining social history.,"Not only an entertaining light read, but a real historic insight into how events would have occured. Uninventable and moving, this writer has a natural talent for depicting human interaction. If she were alive today she'd be writing a successful sit-com."
5,Inspiring,"This book was a great read. My maiden name is Pruitt, which is not too common, and is why I chose it in the first place. I would certainly be proud to have Elinore as a relative, as she astounded me with her skills and fearlessness. She takes her child out camping overnight in the woods, where she kills their dinner, dresses it, cooks it over a fire she has started by herself. She does this because she considers it fun, but it was a tremendous amount of work, not to mention dangerous.I love her sense of humor. And this account tells us just how tough our pioneers were."
4,"delightful reading, so much better than a history book!","I can hardly believe that most of this took place more than 100 years ago; Elinore makes her adventures so real and immediate. I kept being surprised by her beautiful prose (for never having had formal education) and how easy life seemed to come to her. I was impressed by how positive she was about everything even though the reality was so difficult.One reviewer questioned that this was a legitimate account, so I did do a bit of browsing through some history websites and confirmed that Elinore was legitimately a homesteader who did what she says in her letters.By far the best free book I've read! Very worthwhile read."
5,Insight into homesteading in the turn of the century Wyoming,"Wonderfull stories actually written by Elinore Pruitt Stewart. The woman was a tireless worker with a special kindness to her fellow man. You can picture in your mind just what she lived. Her descriptions are as good as they can be. Her kindness will melt your heart. She makes me wish I had lived in the area at the same time. It's such a world of difference from todays progression. I'm not so sure we have progressed to a better life. Even though it was a hard life and a short one I think it may have been a slice of heaven back in old Wyoming. She will tug at your heart at times and make you smile at others.A great easy enjoyable read. I highly recommend it.Steve from Boulder Creek, Ca."
4,questionable,"The book was easy reading and interesting but that woman was CRAZY with some of the things she did. That country was wild and untamed at that time and taking a baby out camping and on road trips in the dead of winter where she ran into strangers where she or the baby could have been killed, raped or abducted was insane. When she let that horse go in the mountains was fool hardy, her thinking was way off. If a horse comes home alone, that can only mean disaster to the person who finds it back home! Where would a person even start to look for her and the baby? Of course I am sure she didn't leave any notes. I too noticed the flowers for the wedding were way out of season. I think she had a very vivid imagination."
1,lois,I read it for a book club. It was a Kindle free book. It was over priced. It was a waste of time.
5,Delightful & Amazing Woman to Read of,This was an amazing woman and story teller through her letters to her friend. What she accomplished in her day was inspiring. Her accomplishments were absolutely astonishing.
4,wow what a life!,"This book was packed full of good writing, good characters and fascinating information. It will not be soon forgotten by me."
2,Boys Swim Floaties,"This product might be good for a very small baby, but there is no arm room when each side is inflated. I thought that there would be alot of room and the bands could be tightened with the velcro closure. I am inserting material and adding more velcro to make them fit. I cannot imagine how small a child's arms would have to be for these to fit. Maybe a stick figure..."
4,safe and easy to use for beginner swimmers,"My 3 and 7 year old have quickly built up their swimming confidence with the use of this product. I love the fabric - very comfortable for the children, and you can inflate the floaties as much as you need to help the product fit the size of the child's arm."
4,Grat stuff,I got them for my boysthey 3 and 17 moalthough theese armbands are bit heavier than plastic onesthey are realy soft and feel good on the skin
2,not for skinny kids,"i thought these water floaties would be better than the plastic floaties that are out there but these don't seem to do the job in keeping our son afloat. maybe it's because he's quite small (18 months and 19+ lbs.). i guess we can try again when he's older but from the reviews i had read, i thought these would be good for smaller kids. although they are easy to blow up and deflate, my son's arms seem to disappear within them and we can't seem to get them on tight enough to stay."
3,For small arms only,Ok i got these thinking my son will feel comfortable being able to stay afloat but they barely fit on his arms and he is 2 years old.
4,"SOFT, COMFORTABLE, GOOD FIT.",I purchased these arm bands along withSpeedo Begin to Swim Classic Swim Vestsize lg. for my grandson. He is no longer afraid and will swim along with us. When he can swim better then the swim vest alone without the floaties will fit him for a few years. Right now the arm bands are very necessary!
4,Water wings,"They fit my 18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company, and they sent a replacement pair immediately. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second pair. I think it may just be the way they're made."
4,Good buy.,"I wanted floaties that were going to be durable as well as safety tested, and i didn't mind spending a little extra to ensure that my two year old would be safe this summer. I was happy with how they fit and how they were adjustable. The fabric was nice and didn't have sharp plastic corners like the cheaper ones would get when filled with air and creased. They wont even deflate if the plug is removed, the plug has to be squeezed at the bottom to deflate. Did i mention a life time guarantee? I am very happy with these."
5,Water and Power,"Susan Hayden takes the gift book format to new heights with The Enchanted Bath. The writing is brilliant, informative, mythic and soothing. Coupled with a packet of bath salts (or not) it is the ultimate intelligent hostess gift."
1,Another dumbed down handheld psp version,Def Jam Fight For NY was the best fighting game hands down to me. It is still fun to play nd its been out for like 10 years. This game is not fun. Its just a game they tried to put on psp nd ended up being stupid like alot of handheld games. Not worth anything
2,"This is not ""powder""","I realize the description is not always what you get, but this is extreme. This is nothing more than shredded coconut that can be purchased at many grocery stores."
1,Out of Date,"This is an old, old bit of scholarship that is not deserving of the name - - instead, try some of the Gospel ""Parallels""."
3,adequate,"Since this book is out of print and my local library no longer carries it, I was happy to have at least an intact copy. My copy is sadly looking its age in terms of paper discoloration and slight shabby edges but the pages are clean and the binding solid."
5,More Than Cest La Vie...,"What an awesome book! It's about time that someone begin to write about real-world possibilities that aid in teaching compassion and acceptance of the innate differences between people. My daughter, a 4th grader, introduced this book to me and I loved it so much that I had the author sign a special dedication inside of it when Ms. Weeks came to our school."
1,"Book is excellent, too bad it is misiing pages.","This book is so good, however when I got to page 156, the pages started over with page 93-124, then began again at page 189.So I missed some important chapters. Not sure it is worth the money to mail it back for another book, but sure was disappointing to say the least.The characters in this book were so likeable and the little girl, Heidi was so persistent in her quest to find out about her mother's background, it made a wonderful story.My granddaughter is the one who recommended this book to me to read."
2,Okay...,"I read this book as a summer reading assignment. I have to say I was extremely disappointed. No offense to anyone who likes this book, because a few parts a liked, but I just don't think it's my type of read. It seemed to have sloppy and unorganized writing at some points. I think anyone who likes family mysteries and finding out who you really are will enjoy this book, though. Don't let one bad review from not buying it. Enjoy!"
4,Good Story - thought provoking,"The audio book was well read and easy to listen to. The story was good and my son and I enjoyed it a lot. I kept wanting to ""listen"" on so I could find out what was coming next. Good easy read - language was easy for kids to understand. I would recommend it."
5,This book is 5 stars,"This book was interesting. Each chapter led to another interesting one. Heidi wants to know about her and her mother's past. All she knokws is that she and her brain damaged mother was standing at her neighbor's door. They have been living with her neighbor ever since. When her mother started repeating a certain word, Heidi starts searching for their history. This book is great. Most importantly , this book is unpredictable and very thrilling."
4,This book draws you in!,"I enjoyed this young adult read immensely and read it in a few hours. It was a unique and original story line, and I really enjoyed the relationship between the main character, Heidi, and her mentally challenged mother. I think there are a lot of wonderful lessons in this book but it is also just a very interesting read!"
5,Very Honest,"When my daughter recommended this book, I looked at the title very apprehensively. Once I began reading, my opinion quickly changed. This is a very heart-warming, painfully honest book about friendships and family."
3,So B. It,"I agree that it is indeed a touching book. But I gave it three stars for many reasons. First off, this book was very realistic to me. Alright yes, the beginning is believable, but the ending? Not to me. What girl goes across the country by herself with permission and never gets in trouble? Also this book wasn't one of those page-turners. In fact I found myself bored a lot of the time. I think this book would have been a great story-if only it was approached differently."
4,so b. it,This story is about a girl and her mom and the mom has a disorder...and the only word the mom knows is SOOF. This is a great book..because at the end of every chapter is like a cliff hanger. And has a very interesting plot. The little girl has to help her mother and trys her hardest to do so. Also the book keeps you coming back for more.Its an awesome book and i recommend it to everyone.Expescially for people who like sad and happy times in a book.
5,The Shannon Perkins Prize for Outstanding Literature,"Okay, so that prize does not exist, but this book deserves accolades. The gentle narrative and mystery in this tale keep you lulled into an excited, desperate world of concern, satisfaction, hope and gratitude throughout this amazing book. Sarah Weeks has treated the subject of mental retardation with grace and honesty. The suspence of the story is simple: what is ""soof,"" (a word the narrator and main character's mother says with a smile almost daily) what is the personal history of Heidi It, our sweet, smart 12 year old heroine and what lies ahead on her journey. Gotta run, but you must read this book. It is a heart pleasing joy."
5,One of the saddest books I've ever read,"Heidi It and her mother ""So B. It"" was found one morning outside Bernadette's apartment. So she took them inside and ended up living with them. Heidi's mother, who calls herself ""So B. It"" is mentally disabled. She only has twenty-three words; which Heidi keeps as a list in the cabinet. One of Mama's words puzzles Bernie and Heidi. It's ""soof"". And one day, while cleaning out a closet, Heidi comes upon an old camera. She develops it and finds pictures that are taken at a Christmas party at ""Hilltop Home"". To find out more, read this touching and amazing story by Sarah Weeks!"
4,Can't go wrong with Helloween,I'm not going to go into detail about each track but if you're a Helloween fan..... Get it !!!!
2,This thing is an ink hog!!!,"I recently bought this printer due to features and price. While it does a great job, it uses way too much ink. I don't do a lot of printing and I am having to buy ink cartridges on a weekly basis. I had an Epson before this printer and will be going back to the Epson brand.I personally think that Lexmark is making their printers affordable and then sticking it to you with the ink usage and cost of cartridges. I would not recommend this printer."
3,Uses a lot of Expensive Ink,"The printer does an adequate job on printing b/w and color. Previously, weused an HP Inkjet that did much better on draft copies and consumed ink at a much slower rate than this printer. Add to this, how expensive the ink is (three cartridges of black equals the cost of the printer) and it's not a real bargain.I do like the scan feature that can make copies even with the computer turned off. That's time saver for me.The ink consumption and the way Lexmark keeps you from buying other ink are real drawbacks."
1,Horrible Product-Lexmark selling broken printers.,"I bought this because it was cheap. I seriously got what I paid for. The printer wouldn't connect with either of our computers (vista or xp). It took me two weeks and four phone calls with customer service for them to believe it was the printer, not my computers. The first week they sent me a new usb cable because mine was ""old"". That didn't work because the problem is their shoddy product.Then they told me my usb ports were not active in either of my computers, which is garbage, because I use them for my flash drive and my mp3 player. I finally had to threaten to talk to a manager before they would send me a new one.This was a horrible experience and a horrible company to work with. I will never buy a Lexmark again."
1,JT USA Delta Faceguard Airsoft Mask,"the quality of this item is too bad, it's only for the protection of eyes, because the mask was broken, when i tested it for the first time. I mean the black part of mask, which protects your mouth and face. It's not for the 500 feet and less velocity airsoft guns as it's written in the description..."
1,Stay away or petition Nuance to upgrade!,"This is a product that Nuance has abandoned for many years. It is not fully Mac designed or friendly. They had to improve installing recently just so it work for being bundled with scanners as a SE. It is not feature parity with its Windows version. After talking with sales/support, I have gotten the impression from them they don't like or understand the Mac market. Don't buy it unless you're willing to fight for a refund. I had to some years ago. I do wish they would improve it so we Mac folks can do some serious OCR work. If you really want a Mac OCR, pound on them to make Omnipage X better, or go with ReadIris, which is OK but not as well done as Windows Omnipage 16. Oh if you are thinking of using a VM tool with Omni16, they wont let you due to how product activation is done. A shame, they could be making money instead of making buyers go elsewhere. But they own the OCR market and can afford to ignore the Mac world. Be warned."
1,Does not work with Snow Leopard! And no free phone support!,"A cautionary tale. Nuance offers no free phone support for this, and apparently all, their products. Nowhere on their web page or in the Amazon description do they indicate Omnipage Pro X Mac will NOT install on Macs using Snow Leopard! SL has been out since Aug. 2009!If you call their technical support number, gleaned from their documents and web page, a phone message points you right back to the web page! I had to call customer services to get the non-free technical support phone number. It took 5 minutes for the ""technical"", I use the word loosely, person to determine what their Web Page or Amazon information should have told buyers. To add insult to injury, they refuse to pay return shipping! Nuance used to be a fairly good company. Omnipage was a great product while it lasted. I would beware purchasing any of their products."
1,Does not work on latest versions of OS X!,"What to say....1. It simply would not install (OS X Tiger, Leopard, and Snow Leopard). It has very clearly not been updated in a long time, and appear to be an abandoned product. They should not be selling this until they update it to the point that it can at least be installed successfully.2. Calls to customer support were incredibly painful.3. Eventually they sent me another installation CD, which supposedly had a different version4. It also would not installI can not say this strongly enough: DO NOT BUY.You will be out $400+, and you will have to deal with a terrible customer support to try and get it working. And in my estimation, you, and they won't be able to get it working.Perhaps their products are great on Windows - I wouldn't know. But I won't be buying anything from Nuance ever again.Nuance: Take this product off the market, please. And invest more in your customer support - its terrible."
1,NOT compatible with Mac OS 10.6! Do NOT Purchase!,"Nuance has NOT upgraded this product to be compatible with MAC OS 10.6.6. It would have been nice for them to mention this in their product info, but they hide this fact both on AMAZON and on their website. I didn't discover the incompatibility till I tried to install it, and it would NOT work. After investing the FAQ's on the Nuance website... there is an admission (small print so to speak) revealing that their product is incompatible with MAC OS X.6 Nice! Now I need to jump through all their hoops in order to get a refund. Hopefully this negative review helps save someone else from making the same mistake I did."
2,Fun but with disappointments,"I've had great fun with my Geko 301, but it's also been somewhat frustrating. I see that other reviewers have also experienced problems such as no functionality in forests. If you're spending a day walking in a forest, the device is essentially useless. I wish someone had told me that beforehand. I'm in South Africa, incidentally. Worse, my second Geko 301 in a period of three years has just experienced display panel failure. The whole screen goes black and you can faintly see the information if you hold the screen to the sun at an angle! The first time this happened to me, Garmin said there was nothing they could do. I wonder if they're going to say the same this time."
4,Great small GPS unit,"This is a great, small GPS unit. It is very light and full of great functions. It won't map, but I use it to just keep from getting lost. Also, the altimeter and the electronic compass are great. The batteries last a while, but I only turn it on occasionally."
2,"Horrible Video Quality, No Subtitles","We all know how funny Black Adder is; we've usually seen them countless times before deciding to own the set, but I was stunned by the shoddy video quality BBC Video came out with, and only the cheapest of DVDs these days are produced with no subtitle function at all. Very disappointing; I will probably return II and III, which haven't been opened. I regretted that their enclosed feedback card was only a viewing survey and had no entry for feedback."
3,Work in the making,"Blackadder 1 or the name of its original incarceration 'The Black Adder' is a series that, looking back, showed promise but wasn't quite on the money. Poor lighting and underdevelopment of characters made it more of a start of something rather than an affirmed instant classic. As The Black Adder, Rowan Atkinson's character is snivelling and cowardly with a speech affectation that may come across a little annoying, far from the later series, where Ben Elton came on board and fleshed out the characters better and morphed Blackadder into the scheming, sarcastic and witty despot that we know him to be. This transition isn't explained at all in Series 2 which is a bit of a head-scratcher but we'll forgive it.I would say to anyone looking at investing into the Blackadder series to start at Blackadder 2. Still one of the best comedies Britain has ever produced and one of our greatest comedians."
3,Digging for the comedy gold may tire some,"I'll make it brief: Rowan Atkinson fans will want to see this, in particular the fans of the other seasons of Blackadder. Those not accustomed to British comedy will be better suited avoiding it. There are some instances of truly witty dialogue and classic situations, but they are beset by a mire of disconnected jokes that feel more like ""in"" jokes that you weren't supposed to get.This is easily the oiliest of the Edmunds...and the smartest of Baldricks. (It's all downhill from here for the Baldrick family.) British icons Brian Blessed and Peter Cooke are as wonderful as ever."
2,Terrible image quality,"I LOVE this show, but the image quality is so bad on the DVD that I can't watch it. You see even older TV shows like the original Star Trek being enhanced and fiddled with to the point that they feel comfortable putting it on Blu-Ray, but they can't at least moderate the crappiness of the video quality on this? They could have run any number of image enhancing or cleaning programs on it but it looks as if they absolutely did nothing to it at all.It's ridiculous how bad this looks. As if it was transferred from a VHS tape. I'm very displeased. I wish I'd been able to see a screen capture before purchasing it."
2,Abismal Sound quality along with overly dry humor.,"Try Mr. Bean instead , much better comedy and more up to date sound quality. Good british humor for the average American."
4,Black Adder I,"An absolute ""must see"" for anyone with a sense of the absurd and interested in English history!"
1,Struggling to make any sense of the last 5 episodes,"The first was kinda funny in spots, but painful to watch the rest of the season. I kept thinking it would get funny, it didn't. Don't waste your time on this season."
4,Excellent,"I saw this movie back in the 80's when we first got our cable television. I've always wanted to see it again and am also a big Albert Finney fan. It was exactly as I wanted it, bringing up nostalga. It is not a four star (1 1/2) movie for many more than myself. I was excited to have found it and now own it. Thanks."
4,Childhood Memories Last Forever,"I was six when this film was released. I remember vividly, watching and being fascinated by this film. Forever since I have fondly thought back to the days of childhood and this movie is resident in memory. It is awesome that this film is available for purchase, it is shame that such a classic is so hard to find. This film is definatly a must see, if for nothing else, the impressive laser imaging of the nude models =) It was great being a kid."
3,"Interesting Idea,","I saw the movie for the first time 8 or 9 years ago, it caught my eye as I am a huge Crichton fan, and I was born in the same town as Albert Finney. sure, it is low budget hokum, but in all honesty it did raise the idea of digital image manipulation and subliminal advertising long before the ""RATS"" episode in the past election. I thought that given the constraints of the budget and of Crichtons very limited directing talent (as anyone who has ever played spot the boom mike in Coma will attest)The movie was really not that awful, and the power pop theme music is worth a couple of stars alone."
4,Forgotten movie,"I have been looking for this movie for years. I remember it from when I was just a kid. It was nice to have finally gotten my hands on it and been able to see it again. The movie was ahead of its time. The basic idea is a company starts using digital representations of real life models and no longer needs the real person anymore. This movie came out in the 1980's, so imagine that! The movie has more suspense too as the models are being killed."
3,Slightly prophetic,"When this movie first came out I recall thinking it was fun - average acting, little suspense, neat optical guns. Seeing it now some 26 years later it hasn't aged too well. The acting still is only average. And like some other reviewers I'm not sure what the motive was for murdering the models - seems like the bad guys could accomplish everything they wanted and not drawn attention to themselves if they had not hurt the models.Why rate this a 3 and not less? The reason why this still rates a 3 after all this time is the very forward-thinking premise about using computers to create digital actors and actresses. It was viewed very suspiciously in the movie. Today we accept this as nothing special, and even appreciate the value of such technology. I'm impressed by Michael Crighton's ability to see the future in this back in 1981.Good movie to own? Probably not.Good movie to rent and watch? Absolutely."
1,Looker - I can't believe this is a movie by Michael Crichton!,"Speaking for myself Looker was a terrible movie experience. Based on my lofty expectations for a Michael Crichton (MC) production I can only score it at one star. I realize the majority of Amazon reviewers don't agree with me, but I have loved everything done by this amazing science fiction writer in the past, and this film just didn't do it for me. I even watched this movie twice, once without commentary and a second time with MC narration. It just didn't work. I am glad to see that the majority of reviewers really appreciate what MC can do, even on what for me was one of his ""off days"". I also think the actors did a fine job under very difficult circumstances. I scarcely need mention some of my favorite MC films but I absolutely loved the Andromeda Strain, Coma, Jurassic Park, Congo, not to mention all of his other fine science fiction and non scifi novels."
4,Great futuristic oldie,"The movie came timely and accordinly. I've seen it years ago in the early eighties, and I enjoyed watching it again now. Thanks!"
3,L.O.O.K.E.R.,"Michael Crichton's film, 'Looker' is pure 80's film at its most fun. The film deals with plastic surgery and the effect and manipulation of television advertisements on people's minds. The film is very interesting because as Crichton points on in his commentary and introduction, the film has in a way become science fact, especially in its take on the advertisement agencies.I like this movie. It's definitely not a great movie, or even a 'good' movie in the traditional sense. It is however, a fun movie, a movie that, if you like Michael Crichton's novels or movies, you will absolutely find enjoyable and intriguing. Highly recommended for Crichton fans and 80's film fanatics."
4,Does Exactly what I wanted to...,"It was hard to find a charger for this old Palm Zire, but I found this. Wish it had a wall adapter, but the vehicle charger will have to do.It does exactly what the description said it would do."
1,I can't finish this book!,"I read Trinity in February, 1978, and I loved it.I have been trying to read Redemption for six weeks now, and am just now fighting the Turks.The character development that enabled Uris to give us background information on many characters (like Caroline, Seamus, Shelley, Atty) without confusing which characters were his clear focus (Conor, Tomas and Kiltie) is missing here. The book bounces around between too many characters and too many story lines with not enough time devoted to any of them to let the reader know whose stories are the crux of the book.Perhaps the problem is that Uris goes over already-told Trinity tales and can't get focused on his main characters. Outside of seeing the word ""redemption"" batted around by different characters, I can't find anything that unifies the stories contained in this book."
1,Unbearably dull,"What a disappointment! Trinity is Uris's best work. When I heard about Redemtion's continuing Trinity's story, I was eager to read it. What a disappointment! Here's hoping Uris already is working on another great book to redeem himself from this debacle!"
2,waste of time after reading Trinity,"I read Trinity 10 years ago and loved it. I picked up Redemption because I enjoyed Trinity so much and because I have read and thouroughly enjoyed every Leon Uris book I read. However, half way into Redemption I felt as if I had already read it (e.g., big wrought iron screens, firemen in Baltimore). I also thought there was enough good history to write about and that Mr. Uris' focus on torid sex was pandering to marketability rather than good writing. I wish he would take one more stab at Ireland and stick to the historical theme more -- there's a lot to tell,"
4,A Good Story,My only regret with this book is that I think I read it out of order. I believe that Trinity was the first of a two part story. But even by itself it stands as a really compelling story. I wasn't prepared for the places it would take me. It was surprising but nice to be transported to New Zealand. And the story of a very bloody battle (Gallipoli) which I had no previous idea of. I first thought that Leon Uris would only be an author of middle east books (having read Exodous and The Haj). But it was a pleasant surprise to find he is a master story teller.
5,Must Read - Irish history in the lives of a few incredible characters,"If you ever read Trinity, but didn't get this yet. Do. If you haven't heard of either before start with Trinity then go straight into this..... Fabulous tale of life, love, loss and how world events shape nations and individuals alike."
2,Trinity it is not,"I loved Trinity. I was psyched to see there was a sequel. Man, the first 200 pages are disappointing. I like the review that said it was a long book report. That's exactly it. Just summary. Booo Leon Uris. You could have done so much more."
4,A Kiwi's View,"Great literature... perhaps not. As the the great nephew of an ANZAC killed on Gallipoli, and the grandson of his brother severely wounded in the assault on Hill 60, I feel that Uris brings more of the history and humanity of Gallipoli than any official record or contemporary history such as Pugsley's. He does for the ANZACs what 'Battle Cry' does for USMC. I am buying a second copy for my children and grand-children.."
3,sequel to Trinity-Redeemtion,I was disappointed that the first 52 chapters reviewed and repeated what he had written in Trinity. I should have started at chapter 53. I was determined to get through both books and I did. I have read almost all of Uris' books and want to read them all. bb
1,Please say someone else wrote this and stole Uris' name!,"BORING in the biggest way possible! I honestly didn't care who won or if anyone won the stupid battle. If I had not received this book as a gift from loved ones who were watching me read it and waiting to see how much I enjoyed it, I would have put it down quickly.No, I would have put it far, far away or given it to a book sale.I'm a long-time Uris fan and I truly hope someone else wrote this awful waste of paper and merely stole Uris' good name.Let's hope the author and the publisher make some charitable contributions out of the money they make on the sale of this book because it ought to be good for something.Deliver us from any more like this one!"
1,"If you Loved Trinity, don't read this","I don't understand WHY the author felt he had to rehash the Trinity story. I loved that book, and was looking forward to the creation of some other three dimensional, admirable characters. There are none in this book. I wish, as someone else who reviewed this book mentioned, that I hadn't tried to read it, because I loved Trinity so much.If I could I'd rate it NO stars. Or minus three."
2,Redemption,"As other readers have noted, this book is not nearly the book Trinity is. Wish I hadn't read it, the first was so good.I guess that's the trouble with sequels."
1,Don't believe the hype,"As a Uris fan and Trinity lover, I ran out to buy Redemption when it was released. What a letdown. It was a Trinity review with some Clancy-like battles that lasted forever. Never thought Uris would put out such nonsense to make a buck."
1,At least it was good for something,"I received Redemption as a gift, but noticed prior to reading it that Trinity was the first book in the series. So I read Trinity and loved it which made me excited to get to Redemption. What a let down. I can't understand how an author would follow up such a great book with something so awful. It was basically a review of Trinity with a little more detail...boring! Although, I'm glad I got to read Trinity. I hope Uris' other books are as good."
1,This book is no Trinity,"Hate to have to rip Leon Uris, but this book seemed like it was written just to quiet those people who clamored for a Trinity sequel. Either that, or he did it to make an easy buck. After reading this, you would swear he wrote the thing in about a week. The writing on Galipoli isn't bad and this book might be okay if it had to stand on its own. But as the sequel to Trinity, it captures none of the inspiring qualities of the original masterpiece."
3,Why rewrite Trinity?,"Leon Uris is one of my favourite authors, but Redemption was comparatively disappointing to Trinity. It was unfortunate to revisit much of Trinity's story in Redemption, and in a more poorly written style that seemed to exist only to avoid exact repetition than anything else. It did improve somewhat in the second half, but it was somehow spoiled for me. I felt patronized in that I, as a reader, could not be trusted to read Trinity first, or take the ""Redemption"" portion of Redemption as a novel unto itself. Do read Trinity. Then read the second half of Redemption. I've not given up on Leon Uris by a long shot, though. He truly is a fabulous and captivating author. More often than not, at any rate."
2,gave 2 Stars only for Gallipoli,"I read 'Trinity' because I was curious about the IRA and the whole situation of Ireland & England. Just wanted to know what the hell it was all about.And I got all the information I wanted and so much more. Trinity not only gave a complete history on the situation but told me what Ireland meant to an Irishman.Now why am I reviewing Trinity instead of Redemption? I don't know. Maybe its because the sequel cant even hold a candle light to its predecessor .Redemption just drags on from basically where Trinity left off. Nothing happens until Gallipoli. But there, the book completely switches pace and becomes very interesting.The Bloody hills of Gallipoli and the British, Australian & the New Zealand forces invasion is described in vivid detail. But that's it. You have to suffer through the rest of the book to get to this part.Give this a miss. Read Trinity instead and hold on to the memories."
3,"Continued saga from novel ""Trinity.""","Trinity was based upon Uris's Irish experiences. While living in Dublin, he had written a photo-essay entitled Ireland, a Terrible Beauty. Trinity was a chronicle of a Northern Irish farm family from the 1840s to 1916, whose fate is connected with two other families, one representing the British aristocracy and the other coming from Scotland. The central characters are a young Catholic rebel and a Protestant girl, who try to find their own place in the country divided by religion and wealth. The story of the Larkin family continued in The Redemption. In these works Uris developed further one of his central themes, the restorative capacity of love and forgiving. Also the situation in the Northern Ireland, from Ireland to New Zealand, Egypt, and Gallipoli."
2,Gallipoli novel derailed?,"The 200 or so pages in this novel that Leon Uris devotes to the battle of Gallipoli Peninsula in WWI are very well-written and extremely interesting. I have to wonder if Uris originally planned to write an entire book about Gallipoli but didn't have the energy left in his old age. He knew he'd make a pile of money with a sequel to his popular book ""Trinity"" so he stuck the Gallipoli story into the sequel.The first 300 pages of this book are a rehash of Trinity and I skimmed over them very quickly. The parts after Gallipoli are mildly interesting but not worth spending a lot of time on."
1,Not the genuine article,"After reading ""Trinity,"" I cannot have been the only one who hunted high and low for ""Redemption."" I see from other reviews that I am not the only one who was, let's say, mildly appalled by what I found. ""Redemption"" has all the earmarks of a novel written for contractual purposes and I'm frankly surprised Uris put his name to it. In my opinion, it is not the genuine article, not by a long shot, and if you're still chasing around to find a copy by the time you read this, then stop. Go on to something else."
2,What a shock,Jessica Simpson once again returns to the music that was widely praised when boy bands ruled the airwaves. Instead of being music foward she has once again choosen to do the same stuff that sounds just the same only now shes dancing around in a bikini. What happended to the morals she use to present saying she would not want to be a sex symbol like Britney Spears? Her new CD is bland; sounding exactly like her old stuff. Save your money and listen to her old stuff.
3,Missing Most Quotes,"Free is free, but the many dozens of quotes the author refers to are missing from this Kindle text. Definitely needs an upgrade."
4,very enojable book,Kristin hannah is a good storyteller. My wife says she enjoys her narrative style which is enthralling. Hannah is gifted at describing relationships between females of all ages. My wife says the book was hard to put down once she started reading it- a compellng story.
1,An Early Work by Hannah?,"Obviously, this is an early work of Kristin Hannah. I've read most of her books, and can honestly say, had I read this first, I never would have read the others she's written. I've never been so happy to put down a book in my life. I thought it would never end. The first novel of Hannah's I read was Home Again and I've read all her works since then. This book isn't even in their league."
2,Original premise but plot is missing.,"The hero is unusual, and potentially endearing. The heroine deliberately different, though less endearing--meant apparently to be redeemed in the course of the book. BUT....The pace is so SLOW, and the plot virtually non-existent. I used to love to read romance, but lately the books seem to drip long overblown blah-blah-blah paragraphs and pages and pages supposedly about emotion while nothing at all is going on, or is about to either. In some books, passages are endlessly repeated while plot is nowhere to be found. Ms. Hannah isn't quite as repetitive as some; but though I need characters I care about, even more I need to read a book that is going somewhere sometime somehow. The snail's pace lack of plot here, or one that could have been handled in about five chapters, just isn't what I want to read.I will say on a sentence-by-sentence level, Kristin Hannah is an okay writer; but THE ENCHANTMENT put me to sleep. I know this nice lady could do much better."
1,One of my all time least favorite books,"This book was so bad that I put it down for 6 months. After I had forgotten how bad it was, then I tried again. I forced myself to finish it thist time but I did not enjoy it. It is just a silly romance that was sprinkled with only a TINY bit of adventure. And the adventure part was the most appealing thing about the story. Everything else was boring or silly. And when I say silly, I'm talking about the sappy love junk that isn't realistic, especially on the guys part. And the worst part about the book is that Kristin Hannah is obviously not a Christian because she continues to use the GD phrase throughout her books. This is the 3rd one of hers that I've read and it may have to be the last since I cannot such constant disrespect for the Lord. I'm not a holy roller Ms. Hannah, but couldn't you be creative enough to use words that won't alienate such a huge population of people?"
5,A good read.,"After a devastating crash on Wall Street, Emmaline Hatter finds herself completely broke with no one to turn to. Deciding that she really has NOTHING to lose, she joins Dr. Larence Digby's search for the lost city of Cibola. Cibola is rumored to have a wealth of riches & Emmaline wants her share of them. Larence has his own reasons for the search but he's unwilling to share them with Emmaline who scorns his beliefs & ideals at every given opportunity. However, the two find true magic & their love story will enchant you."
4,Nice kit for the money,Compact and effective. The blower stopped working after about a year's use. I'd buy another though.
3,Precision 6 Piece Cleaning Kit,This kit is a little bulky and stays at home when the cameras go out. I like the air blower to clean out the cracks and crevices of the housing. The brush is not protected so I don't see it lasting very long. I'll give it to my wife for her makeup brush shortly.(that's what it seems like)
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"I never leave reviews, but this thing is a disaster. Upon opening the outer box, I discovered the inner packaging was open! The ""lens cleaner solution"" had leaked all over the other materials in the kit and everything was such a mess, I don't think I can trust to use it on my camera lenses.I would definitely go to the brick and mortar and purchase one so you can see what you are getting. I am not going to take any chances with my expensive material..."
3,it's an ok product...,"I got mine as part of a package deal with some camera gear.The blower works fine, but I've always found them to be mostly useless, and the rubber smell on this one is horrible. the blower went in the trash. as for the rest of it, it's just common lens cleaner, q-tips, lens tissue, and a microfiber cloth. the microfiber cloths have become so ubiquitous, that I have at least a dozen of them around the house that never get used. I actually prefer a nice soft, well-worn, cotton bandana. lens tissues are a good choice as well, except that they are usually too small.bottom line: get a can of compressed air, a bottle of lens cleaner, an old cotton t-shirt, and you're good to go."
4,Nice Fit,I bought this clutch hose for my old 95 Ford Probe. It fits perfectly and working great. This part is rare to find and I have tried different local auto part dealers but no luck. I then tried Amazon and found it. Great price!
1,BORING!,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! IT IS LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY. IF YOU HATE HISTORY, YOU WILL HATE IT EVEN MORE, AND IF YOU LOVE HISTORY YOU WILL BEGIN TO HATE IT."
5,Xmas CD,Awesome CD so glad I found it wanted to share with myclass couldn't find the first one I bought glad I found ithere
2,"long winded, fact deprived","Reads like an inquisitors manual but unfortunately only repeats tired charges with the same scant evidence and thin standards that the original inquisitors used in their investigations. In the first third of the book only one piece of ""solid"" evidence is brought forth linking the anabaptist and the manichee. This fact being the common usage of the idea that ""Christ passed through the Virgin Mother as water through a pipe."" This is about as conclusive as asserting someone is from Alabama on the basis of saying ""kit and kaboodle."" The book is certainly fun to read, fans of Knox love it, it is full of inuendo and characterizations. ""Heretics"" meet in ""nests"" and the ""virus"" of protestanism spreads throughout the land. Obviously this is antimodernist hoopla which makes fun reading for those interested in Catholic historical narratives before the rise of sound scholarship. -JL"
2,CARAMEL COLOR in their 6 year old Balsamic...,"I purchased their 6 year old balsamic and it had that cancer causing caramel coloring in it so when you pay 10 times the price of something I could have bought at a local store and it has the same unhealthy ingredients in it, it doesn't make me want to chance purchasing a more expensive item from the same company. I could have bought 32 two liter bottles of Wal Mart cola for the amount I paid for one bottle of their 6 year old balsamic if I wanted to buy something with this cancer causing ingredient in it."
2,OH LESLIE WHERE ART THOU?,"Leslie Nielsen is finally in a film that didn't make me laugh much. That's saying a lot for this talented gentleman who gave us so many laughs in THE NAKED GUN movies. But this lame effort from director Rob Spiers is so painfully strained for jokes that when a potential funny one comes along, you've already expected it. Skeet Ulrich looks like he's sleepwalking through the whole movie; Natasha Henstridge looks embarrassed, and Lochlyn Munro looks constipated. There are few funny moments in this film, and it's a shame Leslie is reduced to such a humorless performance."
3,Silly but entertaining!!!!!!!!!,"You have to watch this movie for what it is....the punchlines are silly and the acting is over done, but it is entertainingin it's own way. The scenery is worth watching the movie and thedogs are wonderful!!!!!Don't take life too serious and certainly don't judge this movietoo serious!!!!"
1,Written by a salesman for SAP and AC,The only good thing about this book was that it told of the importance to revisit the project and measure its success after go-live. Aside from that I found this book to be useless. It was clearly written by someone who has never implemented an ES. This book is what an SAP salesman would give to CIO/CEO level customers. The big bang methodology he endorses is nothing but a recipe for disaster. When this is used the only thing it ensures is that an organization will be dependent on consultants for the forseeable future. He is way off base and delivers very little proof or personal experience.
2,Misleading Title,"With this title, I expected something related to complex issues on design, implementation, integration and operation of rea-life information systems. For me, this book was a dissapointment. At least, the title is misleading. By ""enterprise system"", the author means Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) packages such as SAP and Baan, and most of the contents are about very basic overview on ERP. This book should be titled as ""Managers' Guide to ERP"", and could be useful for uninitiated managers who want to know what major ERP products there are."
4,As a college student...,The book was really easy reading! This made the assignments that much easier to complete. Its just like any other book for school.
4,ITS REALLY IMPRESSIVE,I being a first time reader of this book actually fell in love with the book. It is self explanatory and will leads u to become a good IT auditor if u got a comprehensive auditing back groud. i appreciate the effort by mr weber.
2,A Student Perspective,"As a student, I have found this book to be a very difficult read. The chapters were filled with impossible to understand details. Perhaps for a practitioner the book is useful, but as an introductory textbook in a university course, it proved to be a very thick volume with litte useful information."
4,"Great, but doesn't have many of the best songs","This two CD combo is great but sadly its missing some of Tito's best songs. Since coming to New York, I've heard an endless amount of Tito's music and have seen it used for many dance performances, but many of those great works weren't on this compilation. Examples include ""Ran Kan Kan"" and ""Timbalero""; how you can have a 'Best of the Best' Tito Puente album without ""Ran Kan Kan"" is beyond me -- quite simply, you can't.Although I believe this album is a great buy and I gave it four stars, don't be fooled, the title DOES NOT say it all..."
5,Funky Broadway is the bomb!,"From the time HB was on Letterman back in the 80's til now, he has shown himself to be musician of the highest caliber. Funky Broadway is the bomb as well as Until I Do. This is a classic."
5,Fromall Sides,I have this CD as well as all of Hiram's music. He is very talented and has a unique and captivating style. This guy plays so many instruments and also has stage appeal. Keep jammin' and Keep being the KOOLEST Hiram!!!!!!
2,replacement battery not holding juice,Battery came with no initial charging instructions or installation details. Installed the battery anyway and initially charged until cell phone indicated a full charge. Have used it for 3 weeks and find that the battery quickly shows that it has lost one half of its charge. Then it holds onto the second half of the charge pretty well.
4,Fascinating Book!,"What a wonderful story! In this fictional rendering of Malchus, the slave of the high priest famous for losing an ear to the Apostle Peter, we are treated to one possible insider's view of first century slavery, religious corruption and, most importantly, Jesus. While there is much detail to debate and discuss, the story is well written, enjoyable, believable (mostly!) and very thought provoking. It reminds us again that the world into which the Bible was written was, at the same time, very much like our own and yet very different. While we can relate to the shallow, selfish evils of humanity depicted, there is much about the culture of the Gospel completely foreign to us. This makes for very interesting reading."
4,Interesting read,"Pretty good book.Cool story conceptKept my interest,nice little easy read.I like more of an indepth book, but once in a while a nice easy read like this one is good for a poolside read."
2,not worth buying online,the scent doesn't seem to be any better than the candles i pick up on sale at bed bath and beyond
3,Not a bad book for a Jython kick-start,"This book focuses heavily on demonstrating key concepts with the Jython interactive interpreter. While this method is not entirely without its drawbacks, it has the distinct benefit of letting you try out code one line or block at a time (which is one of my favorite benefits of Python in general).Some books are noted for their depth, others for correctness, some for the range of concepts introduced, etc. And of these, I'd say that this book demonstrates the absolute basics of a wide range of Jython areas better than anything else I've read so far. It's the sort of book you can pick up, open to the middle of, and start coding quickly (assuming your system is set up properly, of course).While there is room for improvement in future editions, this seems like a good first edition."
4,Very nice,The content of this book is excellent. I am a novice jython programmer and have been playing with jython for about three years. I have tried numerous tutorials and even have obtained jython books. This one is the best so far. It covers things I did not know existed in jython. The presentation of material is logical and follows a nice gradient of complexity. My only peeves are that the examples are sometimes erroneous and that my book did not come with the examples on disk.
1,puzzle un done,"i love the story of noah... i am so excited to see the whole thing done. so i finished it in no time, unfortunately theres one piece missing and to my frustration theres nothing i can do to replace the missing part. i was advised to get onother one or to just dispose it. WHAT?!!!.... and with a teary eyes, i just throw this puzzle in the garbage.. what good is the puzzle with one missing piece?! zzzzzzzz! =,("
2,Not at all what I was looking for,"This book, while the sketches in it are nice, is not at all a helpful book. It seemed to be just an excuse for the author to publish her sketchbook. No real instruction."
5,Excellent for the beginner,"I love this book, I have been painting for about a year and decided to start drawing my own pictures. It takes you through all the necessities. It may also be excellent for the expierienced drawer, but can't make that statement yet as I am not there yet, but this book is helping me to."
2,Comes Up Short,"Sadly, this book is similar to most on venture capital in that it is based on interviews of VCs. The weakness behind this approach is that it provides unorganized content that lacks depth and utility. In short, while it doesprovide some important insight, these insights are neither unique or critical and can be found in other books that provide a much better resource to the entrepreneur."
1,False advertising,Both book jacket and the book say you can download images from the sybex.com site which are used as samples in the book lessons. Unfortunately that is not true. The Sybex site only has images from a couple of chapters. Three out of 27 chapters!! You need to have your own catalogue of all kinds of pictures available which match the book lessons in order to use the book. What a waste of money. The publisher should refund everyone's money who bought this book under false pretenses.
3,It's just ok..,This is the second notebook pad I've purchased. The first one did not raise the notebook up at all so there was no airflow. This one is designed to allow airflow underneath the laptop. The fans on this model are not very powerful and you can barely feel the air moving. It keeps my Macbook Pro 2.14Ghz around 84 degrees. The previous pad I had stayed around 80 degrees.
3,Cheap piece of junk,"Not Sure what the other reviewers are talking about. The product works & does cool. It is so quiet I kept checking to make sure it was working. But it's very small. I got a 14 inch laptop & it's a tiny bit too small. I would not recomend it for a 16 inch. I used it about 5 or 6 times maybe less than 10 hrs. before it just stopped working, It is very cheaply made & wieghs about a 2 pounds or less. Please do not buy from sellers who are charging $60 for it. I paid $30 down at wal-mart for mine & feel ""taken"" after looking at better deals on Amazon (this thing really is cheap & flimsy)."
2,It's too noisy,"I bought this item from Amazon about 1 month ago. Firstly it worked great, completedly satisfy with this product. But now it makes too much noise. I cannot turn it on at night or in my office."
1,"Would Not Recommend This, I Will Not Buy Another","Cheap plastic, poorly designed; Bottom line: After 12 months the cord frayed and it is now nonfunctional garbage; I will not buy another Targus cooling pad ever, and recommend you avoid this model."
1,Garbage,"I was using this with my macbook pro.This is a horribly designed chill pad. It doesn't raise the laptop up enough to allow any significant air flow, to actually make the fans worth the battery consumption (which wasn't too bad). The two rubber feet on the top edge that raise your laptop up will melt onto the case, and leave black marks. The little dongle switch falls apart, constantly, and you have to push it back together. And WHY is everyone making chill pads out of PLASTIC??? It's called aluminum! Use it!I had this for about 3 months before it stopped working. You cannot set your laptop on your lap while using this, it doesn't even come close to covering the bottom of my laptop, and the fans are laughably weak. Unfortunately, this seems to be the case with most cooling pads."
5,Great Value and Work for Price,I bought this because my very old laptop was overheating. It keeps my computer cool and was a great price when I got it. It is a little loud but other than just great.
2,Use and discard in 2 months,I bought one and it worked for 2 months and then I had to discard it. Would like it to last atleast a year or so
2,Don't bother,"Interestingly enough, this product was offered on the HP site when I ordered my new DV9000 laptop. As previous reviews have stated, it is indeed made of low grade plastic. I find it puzzling that HP would recommend this item, considering the fans line up in no way whatsoever with the laptop's cooling fans. The USB cord is too long and comes with an ON/OFF slide switch (which failed quickly). I cut the switch and wired it directly; it worked OK for a while. Now the USB plug on the chill pad itself has to be in just the right position to power the fans. A waste of money; don't bother."
1,Nice until it died,"I bought this cooler at the same time as I bought my Acer Aspire 5600 laptop (almost 2 years ago now). It worked well for a few months and then began cutting in and out forcing me to jiggle the connector the USB cable plugged into to keep the fans running. Eventually it stopped completely. I took it apart to see if I could repair the connector but it wasn't possible. I've been using the laptop without a cooler but I'm very careful not to block any vents. So far, so good."
2,Worked fine - for about 6 weeks,"I bought this item back to complement my new laptop that gets pretty hot when running high end applications and computer games. It worked great but after about 4 weeks the plug that connects to the cooling pad became loose and the fan would only come on if I moved the cord ""just right."" A couple weeks later it stopped working for good. I would recommend buying another cooling pad and maybe spending a little extra for a higher quality product. This cooling pad is cheap for a reason - and it makes no sense to have to buy the same thing twice. I am now looking at replacing this chillpad, seeing as how it doesn't work at all anymore."
2,Short Lifespan,This cooling fan worked for about 6 months before the USB power cable frayed and it developed cracks in the plastic. I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to be messing with the cord much.
2,stopped working after 3 months,"At first this worked great, but three months after I bought it stopped working. The point where the power connector plugs into the Targus stopped transferring power. If I hold the connector at a certain angle and don't let go then it will work. Very disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Buy new but received used one!!!,"Do not buy from this company that originate from Brooklyn. The cooling pad was delivery 2 days after I order but when it came, I immediately wrote for refund and nobody has yet to reply me (today is 2nd day)The pad I bought is used because there are scratchs mark over the cooling pad plus the two plastic cyclinder where the fan is blowing is scrap.Moreover to further confirm my suspectious I check the opening gap of the console and find that the dust being accumulate below the fan. This is redicules as new pad would not have any dust on it!!!!!Pls beware of this company!!!!"
2,Cools...But Won't Last,"It cools by forced air, which is the best method. The raised top and channels in the top surface allow for air dissipation, and the intake channel in the back supplies air to the fans. But...the power cord doesn't last. I just went through my 3rd one of these in about 14 months. Unfortunately, I've researched for another option and cannot find one that I believe will work effectively. Since my exhaust fan is small, a pad that sucks air might cause a vacuum inside the notebook housing resulting in overheating. I think that I'll purchase another one of these, locally, keep the receipt, and return or exchange it when it breaks down."
1,Quit working,I bought my laptop and decided to buy the chill mat to keep my laptop cool. For some reason it has quit working after only a couple of months. I will not buy another one.
1,Lasted a Week...,After 1 week the performance seemed to degrade; after a month it no longer worked. For that first week it cooled quite nicely though.
3,chills but dies in about a year,"will adequately cool your laptop however, my unit started shorting out after about a year of use. The on/off switch was also faulty."
2,Good when it works,"I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first."
1,Piece of JUNK,I bought this and have regretted it ever since. The fans are too loud and the cord does not stay in the cooler.It's cheap for a reason.
1,"Poorly crafted, no noticeable affects.","My laptop has no difference in temperature than sitting on hardwood. So it's job of cooling my laptop left a lot to be desired, but hey, it angled it nicely for typing. About a month after I bought it though, one of the rubber pads that elevates your computer slid off, it was merely glued. I can't imagine what I could have done to prevent this, as it never left my desk... so I'm going to attribute this to poor craftsmanship.All in all I love Targus products but this felt like trash, you get what you pay for definitely is true here."
2,Works well -- but only for 45 days,"This product worked really well, until it just stopped working. I had the unit for 45 days and then it ceased to work. I think it is probably a short in the cord, but it is cheaply made and I got what I paid for. I should have read the other reviews and noticed that others had, had similar problems."
2,0 for 2 on this product...,"I had a problem with my laptop overheating, so I picked this up. For the three weeks it worked, it worked well; no problems with heat whatsoever, laptop was completely cool even after many hours of continuous use and the internal fans rarely had to run.However, after about three weeks it just stopped. The problem seems to be the on/off switch or connections to the switch. I would look for a different product with a sturdier construction.Update: I got a replacement for the one that stopped in the review above, and even while being *extremely* careful with it (particularly the power cord) it still died after just five months. Fans would either run slowly or not at all. Again, while the fans actually ran it did a great job of reducing heat, but these don't seem to be built to last."
2,Doesn't Really Make A Difference,"I use a laptop since I am always on the go. I noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time. I thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop. It works and the quailty of the product seems to be great, but it really doesn't do much, if anything at all. I think the idea of the cooling pad is great, but not effective."
2,I returned mine...,"I thought this would be a great item but when it arrived I found that it just wasn't what I was looking for. The fan didn't alway work, there were no adjustable legs on it and it just didn't live up to my expectations. I returned it for the iCurve laptop stand and am estatic."
4,Very Good Product,"My computer was overheating even when doing very basic tasks. It was constantly blowing out hot air, very hot air. This product changed that and now it only blows out cold air. The only gripe is that it barely fits under my zd8000."
1,Does not work,"When I bought this, it didn't run all that well although when the fans did actually work, my machine was definitely cooler. However, the fans continued to stop for no reason and now the chill pad does not work at all, and it is only 2 weeks after my purchase. I would not recommend this product. Although it did cool my laptop, the fact that it stopped working after only two weeks makes the purchase waste of money."
1,Terrible - Breaks down in weeks,"And it just makes the cycles of heating and cooling worse. Before, the max temp was 60deg C, and that was a concern. Afterwards,the temp of the laptop went as high as 80deg C. Terrible result. But I lived with it for a few more weeks, as taking the laptop off the pad cooled things down. Yes, with heavy maintenance, it led to lower average temps. But it is much more work than should be necessary."
1,Cheap plastic low flow,"I purchased this product and found it to be extremely cheap and flimsy feeling. The right front screw housing broke when pulling the unit from it's packaging. In addition, the air flow from the unit is extremely weak."
4,A little more than a year so far...,"We purchased 4 of these for our 4 laptops. They come with an on/off switch on the cord and connect directly to the lap top for power from the USB port.Out of 4, two stopped working so we sent them to our ""electronics junk drawer."" Going through my file cabinet, I found the warranties for them, which had expired two weeks ago. argh.So I emailed them anyway. They had me check to see if it was the unit itself or the power cord. Using a working power cord, I found the two ""broken"" units do work, it was just the cord.I now have an email that they are shipping the cords out to me and they should be here in a few days. Can't give them a perfect score, because after all, I spent most of the last year with them in the drawer because something was broken.My daughter says her chill mat doesn't keep hers cool enough and it is always shutting off overheating. But that could be another story.It defintely helps relieve the heat on the lap when sitting on the couch."
4,WORKS PRETTY GOOD!,"I have a 19"" laptop, so trying to position the chill pad is awkward, but it's not a problem. It works great and keeps my laptop cool. I also noticed the battery lasts somewhat longer. I can actually place it on my lap without my legs getting hot. If they made a wider one, it would be perfect."
1,Noisy little sucker,"Got it on sale...what a waster. Really noisy. Ended up turning it off and using it like I did the cheaper version (portable cool pad), just for the elevation off the table."
2,Great Idea - Very Poor Execution,The cooling unit works great - WHEN IT WORKS. Virtually silent when running. But the USB/power cord sucks big rocks. The switch housing is cheap and unreliable. The power connector (not the USB end) also cheap and unreliable. Worked for 2 months - NOW DEAD.
2,"Nice at first, but then downhill quickly","This product worked perfectly for a few months. It was quiet, cooled enough where my laptop's fan's didn't kick in as much as before. It saved my legs from laptop burns, but then the fans started getting louder, the on/off switch snapped off in the off position so i couldn't use the item any longer. I bought another one and the same things happened with the fans, they were quiet for a couple of months and then they started skipping and squeaking. I'm in the market for another laptop cooler..."
5,Chill Pad,"Arrived on time and in excellant condition. It works very well, my laptop is much more comfortable to use."
1,Complete piece of garbage,"Purchased this item, power cord started bugging out within a month. Had to forcefully tape the cord into the back of the unit after it crapped out to even get it to perform marginally.Huge waste of money."
4,Works Great,"Purchased the product two days ago and it came in the mail yesterday. I've been using the chill pad since last night.First of all, like others before me have mentioned, the picture of the chill pad online is not representative of what the actual product looks like. The one I received is gray, shaped like an hourglass and doesn't look as sturdy. However, I have an Inspiron E1505 which is quite heavy but it seems to hold up just fine. As far as the wiring goes, it is not made of the strongest material but since I primarily use it on a desk with little movement, it works just fine. The most important thing is that the chill pad actually chills my laptop. My only concern is that my laptop fan still works fairly hard even though the bottom only feels slightly warm. That may just be my laptop's problem though. Oh and also the price dropped by 10 bucks the day after I purchased it. What gives?"
2,"Very poor quality, but works.","I've had this for roughly 2 years now and it's worked alright. It's nothing spectacular, but it was able to alleviate the heat problems on my Dell Inspiron 1520. However, the build quality is garbage; the plastic feels cheap, and the USB cord is abysmal. I don't know if it's truly proprietary, but if it is I know why other companies haven't had a similar design--because it is awful.The USB cord on the cooler's end is a fairly sharp needle-like plug which has a small hole which connects to a single pin in the cooler. The issue is this pin and the cord are both flimsy and prone to getting stuck. Well mine did not get stuck this time, it broke off.I've seen the new Targus ones and they seem to be of a better design--hopefully that means Targus learned their lesson.I suppose it gets the job done, but for the price... I'd keep away from this model."
2,Get something better...,"One of the first things I noticed about this was that the rubber grips didn't grip my laptop very well. It's not uncommon for the laptop to slide around on it if I move it any.Another problem I've had is some form of ""sputtering;"" that is, it runs for a while, then randomly turns off for a while, and turns back on after another while. I've left my laptop unattended on it to come back and find my laptop very warm.It's not that expensive, so I'd rate it as a decent buy and better than nothing, but I'd get something else."
1,Cheap and a Waste of Money,"Got two of these for two brand new laptops just recently purchased - the first about 1 1/2 months ago and the second 2 weeks ago. The first one lasted about a month before the blades started breaking. By then I had already had bought a second one - which I regret. The second one lasted a week before it started emitting horrible horrible grinding sounds and the first fan blade broke off today.My suggestions, spend the extra money on a good laptop cooling bad that'll last at least a year because if you buy cheap crap like this every 1-4 months - that just adds up anyways."
3,Worked great when it did work.,"In the beginning the fans were very powerful and effective. Also, the concave shape allowed for great air flow.If it simply had a power cord instead of a faulty plug for the power cord, I would still be a happy customer today instead of wiggling the cord to get it to work.I did buy a worse fan pad though, and I have revised my review for that one."
3,Lasted exactly one year !,I bought Targus cooling pad together with my Dell laptop . It has always been very noisy but did a fair job on keeping my laptop cool until yesterday when the fan just stopped working . Very cheap product and a terrible value for the money !
3,"did the job well, as long as it lasted","It did a pretty good job of cooling my G4 notebook; it prevented the weird mottling I was getting on my leg because of having a blazing hot surface on it all the time (I actually use my laptop on my lap, my apartment is too tiny to have a desk). It's not that well made though - as other reviewers have noted, the rubber cord casing (around the red and white wires that actually carry power) tends to pop out of the power switch which is integrated into the cord. You can stick it back in, but it definitely suggests a flimsy product.Mine died after about four months of use, which seems rather short to me even for the $25 I paid at retail. Full disclosure: I did leave it on overnight a few times, maybe seven or eight total, which I'm sure shortened its life, so if you're using one or planning to get one make sure you use that on/off switch. As for me I plan to get a more substantial product."
3,cord needs improvement,"Works great, but the cord started malfunctioning within weeks of purchase. I resorted to blindly pushing and pulling the cord in different directions, and twisting the on/off switch. Eventually, even that stopped working.Luckily, it's not a tough fix if you're experienced in soldering (thanks to my brother), so the cord now works like new. However, I assume most people wouldn't be able to fix it, and the pad is pretty much useless without it, so that's a huge problem. My brother suggested superglue-ing the edges of the on/off switch to prevent the cord from slipping/getting pulled out of place. Perhaps if you do that when you first get it, you won't have a problem with the cord malfunctioning."
4,10-15 degrees C core temp drop,"This product provided a drop in my average laptop core temperature of 10-15 degrees Celsius depending on the processing load and the room temperature. Unfortunately, overheating had already caused my computer damage before purchasing so I can use it for the same computing load any more: the graphics card fried itself so I can't play games.I would like to see a bigger drop in temp, but for a purely external solution working on a laptop with poor cooling, it is more than satisfactory. It is quiet and doesn't draw much power, although the cord is comically long. I didn't even unravel the cord from the factory supplied twist-tie and it's still more than long enough."
2,A good concept poorly executed,"While my laptop is certainly much happier with a cooling pad, I'm much happier with a different cooling pad. The Targus is cheap for a reason - I've already been through two different cables to connect it to my laptop (the wires came disconnected from the on-off switch); the point at which the cable connected to the pad quickly became loose and I'd often have to jiggle the cord to get it to stay on; and the feet first left marks on my desk, and then eventually fell off and got stuck to things. While I'm glad I discovered the world of laptop cooling pads, I wish I'd discovered something other than this Targus first."
5,Does what it says,I like it. It moves the air out the back pretty fast. Keeps my legs from melting with my HP shooting all the air down. Now I can actually work in longer stretches because I don't have to take time to air out my lap.
1,Lasted 20 minutes then died,"This was a major waste of money. It lasted 20 minutes out of the box. Even if it was just a fluke that I got a defective one, I need to note that it did occur. Shoddy craftsmanship. It looks and feels like a toy."
1,Don't Bother,"Product worked for about 4 months. The unit was used for probably 10 hours which were not continuous. It no longer works. Unknown if it is the cord or the dual fan motors. Tried the unit on other computers with negative results. No cosmetic damage, still looks brand new. When it worked it drew the heat out of the computer."
4,"Works well, switch is gone","It works very well. I've been using it more than six months. The switch was gone long time ago, so that I have to connect the cable again myself. But not a big deal. I don't have any overheating problem with my DELL INSPIRON 600m model. Got noisy a little bit, but cannot feel it during the day."
2,Save You're Money,"I received the Targus Chill Pad for Christmas. I turned it on and in less than 10 seconds I was ready to throw it away; It is too loud. I gave it two stars becuase it does keep my notebook cool, but the constant humming noise of the fans is more than I expected. Previously I was using something homemade which worked great and no noise; I've gone back to using the homemade item.The Chill Pad isn't large enough for a 17"" laptop. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Holds it's functionality,"My mom and I have had our Targus's about a year now, and they're still very effective in cooling off our Mac laptops, but after about 10 months, we both noticed that they got a little louder than they had been originally - which still isn't super loud. They're just not as inconspicuous as they once were, and we can definitely hear the whir of the fan as it is still cooling the computer, thereby extending it's life."
4,Good choice for notebook cooling,"I purchased the Chill Pad so I could use my notebook on my lap without getting 3rd degree burns. The Chill Pad with its two fans dropped the CPU temperature by over 10 degrees F. The fans are also very quiet. I can barely notice the noise from them. The Chill Pad is a little too small for my 17"" Gateway, but the size difference does not bother me at all. As in other reviews, I noticed that the power cord is much longer than it needs to be. I just used the same twist tie it came packaged in to take up the slack. I rated it 4 stars since I'm not sure how long the all plastic construction will hold up, but otherwise, I'm very pleased with it. Check some local stores as the Chill Pad seems to be on sale a lot. I picked mine up for $20 at Office Depot."
1,Doesn't handle heavy use,"It worked perfectly for the first month I had it. Then it just stopped working completely. My laptop stays on for about 8 hours a day and so the heat can be pretty intense. It could be that I just need a mat that can stand up to that kind of use and I just wore this one out. If you use your laptop a lot, I would suggest getting a higher quality mat that can stand up to a lot of use, but if you just need a mat for occasional use, then this might be a good item for you."
1,Defective,"So I figured I just got a lemon. It happens. But it seems I'm not the only one. I bought this a couple weeks ago to use when I ran a high-graphics program (only time my computer runs freaking hot). So it's not like it was running constantly. It was working fine this afternoon and all of a sudden this evening I noticed I was starting to smell something akin to clothes left in the dryer too long and my legs were burning. I fiddled with the connections to no avail. It's dead. The most annoying part is this is the only laptop cooling device in this town so now I have to take this piece of crap back to the store and get another one until a better model arrives in the mail. Sure it's only $[...], but for $[...] I'm sure I can find something that, oh, I don't know, works for longer than two weeks?At least the fans were quiet."
2,Was wonderful for the first few months...,"It cooled my 15.4 laptop fairly well for the first few months and then out of nowhere starting making this grinding noise from the right fan. I don't understand what could be causing this because I don't ever move the cooler, it stays on my desk all the time. I would poke at it and sometimes it would quiet down but nowadays even the gentle poking isn't working. It's LOUD and GRINDING. But again, it's a good investment if you need something you'll only use for 5-6 months."
2,"Great for a short time, but then...","This is a very quiet and effective laptop cooler, while it lasts. I'm on my third and last one (it's the only one I could find in my area). None of them have made it past the 5 month mark."
4,"Cool pad, but overpriced.","I use it on my lap for my 12.1"" notebook that heats up pretty quick. It saves my lap from getting burned. I also use it on my desk for the fact that it swivels. I love that because I can easily get to the back to the notebook for plugging things in and out. I couldn't imagine not having one. However, it loses 1 star for the fact that 2 pieces of plastic with rubber pads costs as much as it does."
4,"Nice product, does what it says...","I like my CoolPad very much. It does minimal cooling for the laptop, but it REALLY keeps my lap cool. New laptops just get too hot to leave and work on your lap. With this product, I can leave it on my lap all day with no problem. Also, the ability to rotate it in a meeting is very helpful. $20 MSRP is steep, but you can find it anywhere from $10-$15 and that's reasonable."
1,WORK SUCKS BUY THE OTHER BRAND,THIS FAN WORKS OK BUT EASILY TO BROKE. I BOUGHT THE WIRE FOR SECOND TIME. I USED IT ONLY A MONTH. IF YOU HAVE OTHER CHOICES GO FOR THE OTHERS. THIS FAN IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY
3,Better and Cheaper out there,"This is great if you have a small-sized laptop, but the dimensions are rather small. It would not fit my Compaq Presario 2800 (too small). Also there are other Notebook coolers that have more than 2 fans (I have found up to 4 fans). Though these other coolers are thicker, they seem to cool down the laptop much better and are significantly cheaper. Cheers."
5,Great fan,"I use this fan for my Mac because it tends to run pretty hot, my husband even had a battery semi-explode so I try to keep mine on a fan whenever I use it. This fan is surprisingly quiet and feels really sturdy. It fits great under my 15"" laptop and under my husbands 17"" as well. The newer version of this has a great new design. The price on Amazon is much cheaper than I saw in several online and regular stores when I was shopping around. All around great buy!"
2,OK product but doesn't last long,"Expect this item to last about 5 or six months with rigorous use. I have had 3, 1 died in a couple months, one lasted about 5 months and the third is still running after about 9 months, but I bought a backup because its going to die soon. There is something with the fan location that usually causes the pad to make noise after a few months, making it unuseable. At list price it is expensive...I see it is now ten bucks and at that price, buy a few, and, you'll have ONE good cooling pad."
2,Targus Podium Coolpad,"The Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad for laptop / notebook computers is best used only for a single location. Its multiple ""Lego"" type parts for adjusting its tilt angle can come apart quite easily and be lost if it is used as a portable device. Losing only a few of the stackable pieces can make the coolpad unusable as designed. The oginial Targus Coolpad has only one pre-set tilt angle, but is far more user friendly, especially as a portable unit, which is pretty much the purpose of a laptop / notebook computer. Targus should start making the original model once again."
2,Not good enough,"The power cord fatigued into uselessness quickly. Slipping the pad in and out of my backpack caused me to lose the rubber footies in short order. Even when the footies were there, it didn't cool that well unless I overvolted the fans to 10 V. Look elsewhere."
2,My review,"It didn't work as I thought it would. The laptop didnt get hot as fast but it was still quite hot. After about two weeks, the fan stopped working for some reason."
3,Cheap price,"Get what you pay for. They become noisy every couple of years, but fit my notebook stand perfectly. Bought two."
2,Average,"I bought this for my Dell Latitude D510 which I use several hours a day. The Targus Chill Pad looks nice, but it's not as useful as I hoped. F1. As another reviewer noted, the power cord often comes out of the plug & I have to check the fans several times to make sure they are still working.2. The fans, while quiet, are not very powerful. I think one with a higher RPM will be more helpful.3. The cooler is about an inch too small (all around) for my laptop. This doesn't bother me very much, but for those of you with larger laptops, the Targus will be much too small.4. Finally, even when the fans are working full time, the wristpad is still very warm to the touch, even after only using the laptop for 10 minutes. This is my first notebook cooler & I plan to return it & try a different brand."
2,"Worked great for a year, then got really loud!","I bought a Targus chill mat a little over a year ago, and it worked perfectly up until recently. It still turns on and cools down my HP 15.4"" laptop, but the fans make so much noise that it's incredibly irritating. It makes it difficult to have a a conversation or watch tv/listen to the radio. The warranty is only for a year...oh well!"
1,Just a Warning,"This review is just a warning to buyers. I bought this item at Best Buy about 2 days ago, and already this cooling pad is broken, and I'm going to return it. It will work, but I would have to hold in the power cord very tightly to keep it powered. There's a reason why Amazon has such a ""good"" price for this pad. I paid 30 at Best Buy, knowing that Targus usually makes quality products, but this is there one downfall."
2,Only worked for nine months,It did a fine job while it lasted but wore out after about nine months of light use.
1,Second chill pad to quite working.,This is my second purchase of a Targus notebook chill pad both stopped working after a few weeks.
3,Its OK but...,"I bought this product 1 year ago. It works great for 1 month, after that the fans stop working. The solution was simple, cut off the switch (its not necessary) if you plug it into a UBS port, its bucause you need to fan you computer.After this simple operation, its working again. I think it worth the money that you pay!"
5,Travel Coolpad,"An essential item to keep your laptop running cool while traveling. The podium coolpad is a better choice for home or office use since it tips the laptop up a little more and allows for better air curculation, but also is bigger and doesn't fit as well in a laptop case."
1,Targus Chill Pad,"This cooler stopped working 2 months after I got it. I think it shorted out in the cord, but whatever the problem, it still doesnt work. I would not reccomend this chill pad to anyone."
4,Chill Pad,"I love my new chill pad. My Dell laptop gets extremely hot during use, but the Chill Pad completely cools the laptop."
5,Great!,"I've had this item for a while now, and it works great. It is quiet and it keeps my laptop cool. I actually just bought another one as a gift, worth every penny"
4,works well,the chill pad works really well if you have one of those laptops that overheat (like most dells). however i'm not sure about how long they last b/c my last chill pad started making weird sounds b/c hair somehow got caught in the fan and i couldnt take apart the chill pad to take the hair out. other than that the chill pad does what its supposed to do.
2,Works well...'til it breaks,This is a great idea and the price is right. However it is not well designed. The on/off switch is on the USB power cable and is very easily broken. I think placing the switch on the side of the device itself or at least making one that is more sturdy would improve this product immensely.
3,It's OK...,"This DOES make a difference, but I found myself wishing that it worked better than it does. On the positive side, it is lightweight, (although I see what some reviewers mean by the cheap feel), and the fans are relatively quiet. However, it doesn't move nearly as much air as I wish it did, (which is probably the tradeoff for the quiet fans!) When all is said and done, while it helps, my laptop still runs pretty hot when using taxing applications. Just a so-so product for me."
3,"worked great at first, but burnt out quickly",I bought this product about 6 months ago and I was very happy with it until recently when it decided to just stop working. I personally don't like buying things that I'm just going to have to replace again in a few months so I would recommend going with another brand.
4,Coolpad works!,"I've had my Coolpad for over 4 years and love it. It is simple and I would have given it 5 stars if there was a bit more thought in the design. But it is simple, reliable and compact."
1,Targus PA248U Chill Pad,Worked for all of a month. Fans began making noise almost immediately after purchase. Then one of the fans stopped working. Save your money and don't buy this item. I finally threw the thing away and bought an Antec cooler.....after 7 months it still works great.
1,has too many issues,"I have gone through three of these coolers. All with the same issues. Either the wire stopped working or one of the fans. It is made very cheaply and isnt meant to last long. It does keep your laptop cool but its durability and reliability are very poor. Go with the antec laptop cooler, excellent unit that has worked great for me for over a year. The antec is built much more durably than the targus so go with that one."
1,There are 2 different PA248U models,"The chill pad in the picture (silver rectangle) is NOT the model that's shipped today. The model pictured is the older model (item #21) and it was great. It was made of very sturdy plastic and VERY quietly cooled my laptop like a refrigerator. My only complaint with it was that the switch on the cable got broken.The new ones have the exact same model number PA248U (only the new one is item #22) but is a brownish gray, curved like an hourglass, and the switch is on the pad not the cable. Targus was either dumb or deceptive on the model number. This model is a piece of junk: it apparently uses less rigid plastic, runs very loudly until the plastic heats up. Then the fans hit the inside of the housing and either quit working or make even louder scraping sounds. I bought two (thinking I was getting the original pads) and thought I'd try them out. Oddly, they both become defective right after the Amazon return date. Don't waste your money."
1,Poorly designed connector,"I've been through two of these chill pads in the last month. The reason is the power connector: it's at the back of the pad. If you ever use your laptop actually on your lap, for example sitting on a bed, you're going to keep bumping into that connector. The connector itself is cheap and doesn't fit well into the cooler's socket. The result is that it eventually breaks off and stops working. If you use your laptop anywhere other than on a desk, I would strongly recommend skipping this one and getting the Antec cooler instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BVYTV"
1,This really Blows!,The product worked great for about a week. Then the blades of the fan started to fall out one by one. Then it had a machine type oder. The fans continued to get stuck. Now only on fan works. Would not recommend this product. It's a waist if time and money.
1,Not so good,I bought this chill pad some time ago. It is not at all good. Just after use of a month or so .. the wiring became loose and now i have to keep it at a specific angle to keep the fans running. Fan's run slow also . Not as good as other products in the market.
3,Wrong Item,The picture they have for this item is wrong. I wanted to receive the old chill mat but they shipped the new model. The new model is a different shape and runs louder. Make sure which one you want.
2,Fourth replacement of this pad,"I have had to purchase this item locally on four (count 'em) four different occasions. The pad works great for about 3 or 4 months, then just shuts down. It's cheap enough and the only option locally, so I kept buying it. Now that the 4th has shut down, I've had more than enough hassel and will be purchasing another pad here on Amazon. It works, but be prepared for it to not be a permanent solution to your laptop cooling needs."
1,very bad quality,This product is very flimsy. do not buy it!!!!! will not last for mroe than a few weeks unless you baby it.....
4,Depends on your use,"I have had this since January 2008. It has done a very decent job of helping to cool my Dell 1525 laptop.Which does a decent enough job on its own i must admit. Yes the picture is different and it is made of plastic. If you are a busines user I do not know if this will help, but for Home use on a normal scale, I would say this product helps to keep the Laptop cool.P.S My brother has an HP Laptop and is a Journalist. he uses his laptop a lot. His Laptop Fan does not do a good job at all of keeping cool. This Product has helped tremendously.Also Best Buy are selling this for $31."
3,"Flimsy, different than picture","First of all, the cooler I got looks nothing like the picture. It's more hourglass-shaped than rectangular. That makes it hard to firmly hold the laptop and the cooler at the same time when lifting them.Which leads directly to my next point: the cooler won't tolerate any drop at all, even the one foot length of the USB cable. Mine broke two fan blades; it happened the first day I had it.It still works, but it vibrates quite a bit on my lap (or I would have given it one star, ha).It does prevent the laptop from cooking my legs, which is what I bought it for. But I doubt it'll last the week."
3,laptop fan pad,"pad works as stated although wired connection to pad sticks way out in the back. Also, the resting pads only in the four corners doesn't support my laptop correctly, eg. one of the rubber pads makes contact with my laptop's battery instead of the laptop's frame."
2,Pacific Cooler is better.,"While this product did last me for more than a year without malfunction, I recently bought the Pacific Cooler which is much better. Given the choice between the two, I would not buy this laptop cooler again."
2,Cheap wiring,"This cooler worked great - at first. The cooler itself did a fine job. However, the USB cord that connected it to my laptop pulled apart at two different places and exposed the inner electrical wires. After a week of the wires being exposed the cooler stopped working completely.If you don't mind spending [...] bucks every few months, go ahead and get this - because a few months is as long as it's going to last you."
3,"Three Stars, No More","It does what it says it does.But it didn't prevent my laptop from getting too hot to touch.Silent, so you may not be aware it is working.It collects far too much dust for a device that is supposed to exhaust the hot air out the louvers in the back. I would have expected to see the dirt behind the laptop. not underneath it."
2,Ok at First,"I got this to keep my laptop from setting my lap on fire. It worked pretty well if I moved it so that one of the fans was actually under the CPU. This sort of threw the whole system into an oddly unbalanced set up unless I was at my desk. But then, after less than a month of use, the power switch on it broke off leaving disconnected wires and no power. I got out the wire strippers and put the thing back together temporarily, but this thing is just poorly made. Its not a notebook cooler if the fans won't spin.What I did like about this is that it is lightweight so it doesn't add extra pounds to my already too heavy bag, and the fans ran pretty quiet."
4,good product,i had very good service i like the unit only wish it had a usb extra hub to plug other add ons but for the price does keep laptop cooler .
3,Works well when it works...,"I've owned two of these now, and my biggest complaint is the USB power cord. I have to jiggle it now to get the fans to turn. The first Chill Pad I bought lasted approximately eight to ten months. It's power cord was then lost in a move, so I bought a replacement. The second Chill Pad has lasted less than one month. I'm planning to contact Targus, but considering that I no longer have the receipt and the product is a month old, I'm not hopeful. All in all, it has done it's job, but I wouldn't recommend this particular model."
5,"Works Great, Easy to Carry","Like this product for several reasons:- Lightweight. I carry it to work every day and while traveling.- Compact. Easy to carry whether on travel or not.- Great swivel feature. Great when sharing the screen with the person next to you.- Good for ergonomics. Without it, I find myself shifting my hands to an awkward position or I end up shifting the laptop. Now I just nudge it left or right."
1,Tornado,"I purchased this product about 2-3 months ago, and it has already quit working! It did do an okay job, but what a waste of money it has turned out to be. It is worth purchasing a better-quality laptop cooler!"
2,cupcake or muffin pan,"our inspirion 8200 notebook kept getting so hot when i was using it while sitting it on my lap...""laptop"" anyway it would get so hot at times it would leave burns on my leg in desparation to help..my husband gave me a cupcake/muffin baking pan i simply turned it over and placed the computer on it. Wha-la our laptop stays much cooler and no longer shuts down and we didn't have to spend any money. Just a little good ole fashion ingenuity!!"
2,Probably will not hold up,I have had this for about 5 days now and it has worked pretty good for the first few days. Now i will look under my notebook every so often and the fans are shut off. I have to fiddle with the power cord for it to turn back on. A simple rotation of the cord around the power hole seems to get the fans going but i can't imagine this will hold up much longer.The one thing I like about this is that the cord is long. This is sometimes a distraction but when i am near a deskop I can plug it into that computer instead of my notebook even if it is on the floor below.
2,Died after 2 months,Works great for cooling your laptop. After 1 day I noticed that the wires near the on/off switch were exposed. I had to keep pushing the cable back in to get it to work. Today it completely stopped working. I just ordered a new cooler different brand. For now I just turned it over and put it under my laptop. It lets air get under there so it does keep it cool just not the way its supposed to.
2,item is not in good condition,"I like this product, but it was not in good condition when I received it. damn it...!"
1,One fan made a scraping noise,"You're money is better spent on another product.It's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made. A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet, damn near silent, if it isn't damaged. I had one fan made a scraping noise.The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop, but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought Targus because of it's price and ratings on Amazon. I'm disappointed with the results I've gotten from this product. After a month or so, the fans stopped working. I received the same product from a friend and only after a few minutes of work the fans stopped working yet again. It has been my conclusion that the fans stop working at a certain temperature (ironic, isn't it?). I still have both Chill Pads, and when they occasionally stop working I switch one for the other. All that money wasted..."
3,Would actually rate this a 3.5 or at most 4 ....,"Well, I purchased this item for my Gateway 4026GZ laptop cuz I noticed it was running a little sluggish and a friend told me try getting a cooling pad and see if it runs the computer a little cool and give it more speed. So I tried it and I can't really tell if it's working or not. I installed new memory chips and now got 1GB. So I don't know if it's the memory chips making it run faster or the fact that there's a cooling pad. I still feel hot air blowing outta the side of my laptop. :P On Winter months I use it as a hand warmer that's how warm the air is. Kinda like a laptop with a mini heater on the side. But it seems to be working find via USB port and not too loud of a sound. I can't say I'd recommend it cuz I don't know if it's even making a difference but at the price you're paying for it. All I can say is just TRIAL and ERROR !! Buy it and you see for yourself if it's JUNK or TREASURE."
2,Stay Away,"I'm in the habit of sitting on my bed or sofa and using my laptop, and I bought this so I would be able to play Warcraft without burning my legs. It worked pretty well for about a year, and then the fans died. Figuring that it had been dropped or otherwise mishandled, I went out to buy another one. It died after a month. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. I went back to using my senior yearbook as a heat shield rather than buying a third. It gets two stars instead of one because it actually kept my computer (and my lap) comparitively cool...still, you'd be better off cooling your laptop with a ziplock baggie full of ice."
5,just get it,"Yes, the cord is too long. yes I've hooked it a few times and almost put my notebook on the floor. BUT, it makes my Ferrari 4006 - that previously could be used as a hair dryer or popcorn popper after only a few minutes - totally cool both to the touch and out the vent.If you have a 15.4 widescreen like the Ferrari (exact same chassis as the travelmate and new macbook but the ferrari's AMD64 runs way way hotter then either the solo or duo intels, way better chip has it's cost) don't worry it is fine, the puter is wider but it's held securely by the rubber pins.Major TRUE & NOTICEABLE difference over just having a non-fanned air-venting ""lap desk"". Originally I was only using this when at home but now it goes in the case with the puter and I use it at every table.Look, it's cheap enough to buy a couple (about half the price of one good thick computer book, right?). Everything breaks, this is worth having a spare and living with a 6 month individual lifespan."
1,Did not work for me!,"I bought this product an I do believe less than a month later it stopped working. I also have a friend that purchased it, and it stopped working a few weeks after she bought it. I really regret buying this."
4,Inexpensive and very helpful product,"Inexpensive, lightweight, and really cools down my laptop! The one I bought from Best Buy didn't last for more than a month (the fan just stopped working for some reason). However, the one that I got from Amazon works perfectly!"
2,Good Idea - Bad Implementation,"I had high hopes for this product, which is perhaps why I'm not giving it a high rating.This Chill Pad simply does not work. The idea is great, I'd love something that takes the heat away from my MacBook Pro, but this simply doesn't do it. My hands and lap are sweating as I type this review.For $20 I can't really complain. But buyer's beware, this won't magically take away all of the heat. It does provide some sort of shield between your lap and your laptop, but a book or newspaper can provide the same protection. The fans do little to no cooling."
1,Not that great,"I have this chill pad and all I can say is I wish we had taken it back. It is not good if you like to use your laptop on your couch on your lap, it might be better on a hard surface. If you use it on your lap the laptop will constantly be sliding off the unit. We have had ours for a little over a year and the fans just went out, not that they cooled that well in the first place. I wouldn't waste your money if you want something you can use for a while."
3,not a high speed fan,have been using this daily for a while now and the fans are weak. it does circulate the air but not with very much force as my last cool pad did. it is still working and with my new computer the pc fan rarely comes on. with my old laptop the pc fans would run constantly when watching movies. i wouldn't recommend this pad for any serious cooling needs.
1,Don't buy it,I received the package. When I went to plug it in to use it it didn't work. Plain and simple. The product also was put together very cheezy.
3,You Get What You Pay For,Great design does what it says.It Keeps the laptop from getting to warm.The problem is its got some really cheesy made fans that are quiet at first...Then after a week or so they show just how cheap they are!They wine vibrate and sometime they just quit!So you have to tap it on the side to keep them going or quiet them down!
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I purchased the Chill Pad after seeing my brother-in-law use it. I use it with my MacBook Pro. MacBook Pro's tend to get pretty hot on the left side, but the Chill Pad keeps it probably 15 degrees cooler, making it much more comfortable to work on. I'm very, very pleased with it. My only gripe would be that it is kind of noisy, but since I usually have music playing while I work, it really isn't that noticeable."
2,New model is too LOUD,"I've had the previous version for about a year and was happy with it - until the power cord failed. A few times I forgot the thing was attached to my laptop's USB port and jerked the cable pretty hard.So for ten bucks, I didn't hesitate to buy another. Unfortunately they've redesigned the unit (doesn't look like the picture as shown on this date) and the two fans are a lot noisier now. It looks better I guess, but the sound is going to drive me nuts until I find a replacement.Can't recommend this product."
1,waste of money,"complete waste of my money. the first time i bought it, worked fine for 2 months, then the stupid on off switch cable was comming apart, so i bought a new one. then the new one had the same exact issue. in addition, i have a 17 inch laptop, this cooler barely does the work, it will work fine for anything smaller than a 17 inch. i purchased a coolermaster notepal and that cooler is so much better. the only good thing with this is that it works fine if you want to work on your lap, other then that, i would not invest my money on this."
2,Good product but not durable,"When I first bought this product it was great. It kept my laptop cool, its light weight and its very quiet. But it fell apart quickly. The on/off switch broke off and I ended up just securing the wires by hand and lots of duct tape. Then the little plastic pieces over the fans broke off. Granted, I used this daily for two years and took it around the world a few times so I got a lot of use out of it. I suppose if you just keep it at home most of the time it would last a lot longer.BTW: I recently bought the newer version of this (dark gray and thicker) and it sucks, its much louder than the older model."
5,unexpected uses,"I gave this as a gift because my boyfriend is always saying how hot his legs get with his laptop. What he really enjoyed about the coolpad was the swivvle feature and the angle it puts the computer on. He couldn't be more happy with it. so, it had more delight then originally anticipated. The shipment arrived on time like it was predicted and there was nothing that went wrong. I was very pleased"
1,Don't buy Targus products!!!,"I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought. They last about 2 months before they stop working. Either they will just completely stop working or the fan blades will start tearing off, and then stop working. After about a week they start making a loud sound like something is caught in the fan blades. Unfortunately, they were the only brand available in my local stores, so I had to settle. I will never trust Targus for any product ever again!!! Sure, they offer a warranty, but to be honest, I'm not going to keep my receipt and warranty information in order to get them to replace the junk they sold to me with another piece of junk that will stop working in the same amount of time and charge me over half of what I paid for the product for shipping."
1,Targus Chill Pad Vibrates,"Please do yourself a favor and forget about buying this noise maker. The chiller seems to convert your computer energy, via USB, into vibration noises. The air current seems to simply be a by-product of the need to rattle. Opt for a sturdier, more effective chiller. I'm avoiding this brand simply out of spite."
2,Find something else,"I should have read reviews for this product before purchasing, but I just picked it up quick at the store, and I'm sorry I did. The product is very cheaply made. The fans make too much noise. And now, after only typical usage, nothing heavy or out of the ordinary, not even a lot of travel, the fans are working only intermittently, and I am going to have to replace this product. Definitely not worth the cost."
3,didn't cool enough,"I liked the chillmat, but it doesn't blow air onto the bottom of the laptop, but it sucks air, and blows it out the back of the chillmat, and i guess, for some computers, it's okay. Mine wasn't much cooler to the touch than w/out it. I guess since mine tends to get hot on the lower left, where my palm rests, it wasn't as nice as I would have wanted for the money. I ended up buying another cooler from Vantec (lapcool2) which actually blows air onto the bottom instead of drawing air. It did a better job. I still have the targus chill pad, but won't use it unless the vantec breaks down. So in my opinion for my AMD Turion 64 laptop, I'd prefer the Vantec over the Targus."
1,WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!,"I am a long time very satisified Amazon.com customer. I recently purchased this Chill Mat manufactured by Targus. After owning it for approximately 3 weeks I noticed permanent black stains on my dining room table and coffee table where I regularly use the chill mat. The stains are a result of the little black rubber feet on the bottom of the mat.My furninture is permanently damaged from using this product, and I just felt the need to warn others that may be considering purchasing it."
1,Targus Chill Pad is really disappointing,I bought this to use at home with my powerbook. I use an Antec cooling pad at my office which works very well. This cooling pad is really disappointing. The fans barely move and my powerbook's fan still has to come on to supplement. I bought this one to save 5 bucks. I should have just paid 5 bucks more for another Antec cooling pad. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,It's cool!,"Good price and fast shipping. But, the fan noise may lull you to sleep if you enjoy the white noise. I can't realy complain for the price was nice and the product does do what it was intended to do, and I do like that it has a USB connection and you don't have to plug it into a wall outlet."
2,"In theory this is an awesome product, but...","in reality, it isn't. I have had my Chillpad for some time now. I don't take it with me, so it stays in the same spot on my desk all of the time. I have had some of the same problems other reviewers had: the on/off switch has fallen apart completely and the fans can be pretty loud. The product itself seems cheaply constructed and I wish the fans were moved to the back and not in the middle of the pad. With that being said, the fans do help keep my laptop cool. Long story short, if your laptop runs too hot, this will help. I just would shop around for other alternatives first."
2,Glad it was on sale!,"I bought this in February and the price was 13.99. I thought it was such a great deal with all the good reviews so I bought it. Well, it doesn't look like the picture...it's the one with the curved sides. But that didn't really bother me. It worked great at first, it was just kind of loud. Now it randomly chooses to work at all! I don't know if it's the connection or what...but now it's merely a surface to sit the laptop on.I suggest not bargain shopping on this sort of thing. :-/"
2,would have been nice if it didn't break!,"this notebook chill pad is a great product...until it broke about a few months later. It's not like I man-handled it either. It's was quiet and it did cool the notebook off very well, but since it did stop working I have to rate this low"
3,Mediocre at best,"I'll start with the good. For its price, the device does add a fair amount of circulation to the underside of your notebook. I don't recally my MacBook getting particularly hot while using this, even during downloads. I'm usually wary of powering devices with my computer's battery, but I didn't notice a substantial difference in battery life.That said, the price is what it is for a reason: it's cheaply built. I've only had it for a few weeks and one of the fans is making distracting noises and most of the rubber inserts have fallen out at least once (and they're easy to lose). Also, said inserts have a tendency to leave nice black markings on your notebook. They come off easily, sure, but it's still irritating. It's also not particularly comfortable on the lap, if you're using it for that.Personally, I'd go for something slightly more expensive and better quality."
1,Horrible!,I orderd this chill pad in May. Didn't actually open and use it until the end of August. it has abruptly stopped working as of last night! Piece of garbage..........
2,Cheap and Dissapointing,"Sadly, I bought this cooling fan without researching the market. It is not powerful enough and makes a loud whirring noise. My laptop is still ultra-hot, the cooling pad is now just used to prop my laptop up so I can direct a mini-fan under it.I contacted the company about my unhappiness towards their product and they said to bring up my issue with the store that I bought it from. Which is okay, but I only realized that it was terrible after the returning period ended."
1,look out,I went out and buy the Targus PA248U Chill pad because my last cooling pad was a Targus that I had for long time befor it stoped working and it was agreat chill pad but this new Targus CHill pad didnt do any thing for my gateway MX6453 computer all I do on it is use the internet to watch movies and talk to friends and listen to music mmm but this chill pad was loud and didnt do any thing for my notebook computer if some one asked me if they should buy it I would say dont go look up othere chill pads/ cooling pads over all it was loud and didnt work at all does not matter how I set my note book computer on it
2,Targus Turn Upside Down,"I have owned other Targus laptop Chill Mats and/or Pads that have worked very well for me. With the exception of this particular Chill Mat. I have been using this Chill Mat for four or five months now and have noticed that it was actually hotter using the mat than without using the mat. After comparing it with other devices, I noticed one single flaw. The device pushes air upwards towards the laptop. I saw a Technology Demonstration on Youtube.com, and I was using the mat in exactly same way as it was demonstrated. I have since turned the Chill Mat Upside down[opposite the mat direction as orientated in the above photo]. After turning the mat upside down, it is now pulling the heat down away from my laptop, making the laptop tremendously cooler. Either the Targus Chill Mats were improperly designed to push air upwards, or I received the Mat that missed the quality check. Either way, make sure the air is being pulled downwards and this device will work fantastically."
4,Chill Pad for Laptop,This product works great when using your laptop as a true laptop. My laptop would get so hot that it was uncomfortable to hold on your lap. The chill pad works great to keep the laptop from overheating.
3,little horse,"good product doing good job for good price......till the switch fall a part and then just keep twisting the wiresto keep the fans thing running...little detail to screw good product.especially when you forgot that the fans are not running,because the wires are disconnect and your notebook dyed on you somewhere in middle of your work..."
2,Good while it lasts...but not a long term product!,This product worked well for the first 5 months then started making loud noises. I've had it for 8 months now and the chill pad is dead.
2,"Great idea, but fell apart",I have been using a Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad for quite a while now and it is great. I bought this Traveler Coolpad for one of my nieces since it was a bit smaller and less expensive.One of the pieces (that elevates the laptop) broke off after only a couple months. She's a freshman in high school and not particularly rough with her belongings.This was really disappointing. Next up: buying her a Podium like I have.
3,"Ugly but functional, however, consider this alternative ...","... from APC (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00022KJFC/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_3/103-8464419-5683020). It's a few dollars cheaper, and just LOOKS a lot better than the cheesy looking Targus Podium CoolPad. So if you cut and paste the above link, you can read my review there."
2,Overpriced and Only Marginally Effective,"At $25.00+, this product is grossly overpriced. In terms of cooling capability, it is strictly passive (i.e., no fans or other cooling mechanisms) and isn't even constructed of endothermic material that would draw heat away from your laptop; any cooling that occurs is soley dependent upon the stray breeze that may or may not flow under your machine. The device does allow you some modicum of tilt adjustablity, but only within a 1/2"" to 1 3/4"" range. Additionally, the lego-like system used to make the tilt adjustments is cumbersome. On the plus side, the swivel feature works well.This product would be worthwhile at $10.00, but at $25.00, I would avoid it."
4,Fair...,"It was what i spected; Kinda smaller than the dimentions they specify in the decriptions, but it works good..."
2,Works great...at least for a little while.,"My husband's laptop was overheating constantly while he was doing his work, so we bought this chill pad to help alleviate the problem. The chill pad worked nicely for about a month. The switch broke soon after, and I put it back together, but had to seal it closed with tape. A few months later it shorted out and hasn't worked since. It was disappointing to say the least. If you don't mind buying two or three of these a year, it does work well when it's working."
1,worked for a week,it worked ok for about a week maybe two then became unreliable. I have yet to find a chill pad that works well. I would not recommend spending your money on this one unless you consider your money extremely disposable
1,this sucks,I've bought this product 3 different times and each time it lasted MAYBE 2 months b4 it just died. The wires alway get loose inside so it's basically just a table for my laptop. Don't buy this if you want goood value for your money!
2,"Fragile, fragile, fragile","Let me state upfront that I have no problems with the product doing what it claims to do. The product worked really well for me and I was very happy with it--for a couple weeks. The switch that turns the fans on and off is very fragile and even though I never really used the switch (I generally left it on) After awhile of moving the unit, the cords going into and out of the switch loosened and the fans quit working. For awhile I was able to push the wires in to get the fans to run, but eventually even that failed. :-( The company does have a warranty, but they didn't seem to enthused about replacing my unit. I wanted my money back, not another poorly made unit. Save your money and buy a better made unit!"
1,Does not cool anything down..,"I baught this to try on my friend's Dell Inspiron 8600 notbook. It did not help at all. Using books to lift up the back end of the notebook gave the same effect at no cost. The notebook barely fits on the device and may be the reason that the device did not work. May be this will work with small notebook... If you have a big 15"" or up notbook, look for somthing else."
3,Cord is a Bust,"I bought two of these for my daughters laptops. One hasn't had a problem with her powercord at all, but her laptop stays on her desk at school. The other one moves hers all over the house, we have been through one power cord already (Targus replaced it at no cost). I have just emailed them again, to see if I can replace the cord. It is past the one-year warranty, so it will be interesting to see if they will charge me. I'll keep you posted on whether it was free or how much I had to pay. Other than that....the chill mat is great. It keeps the laptop cool and is so quiet, you can't tell if it is on. Too bad they wouldn't make that on/off switch durable. (I may just put electrical tape around the on/off switch and just turn it off by unplugging it from the laptop."
3,Eventually runs out but good while it lasts,"I purchased this about 8 months ago because my laptop would get so warm where my hand rests that it would almost burn. I was VERY impressed with it when I got it. I have an extended battery so the fans were able to pull the air away very nicely.It is light weight and compact - fitting in my bag without adding too much weight or bulk.Like another reviewer, the cord was rather annoying long and the on off switch is not the best. I also wasn't too happy about losing out on a port, but all in all have been happy with it.About a month ago, it started just turning off in the middle of my using it and now it is completely dead, I can't get the fans to turn for anything. I do use it a lot more than is probably average and I don't know if it is a wiring problem or what."
2,Be sure you know what you're getting - could be dangerous!,"The picture of this unit appears to be an older model. I had the silver version and it worked well for more than two years. It had a vent in the back to channel air out. The model I replaced it with is black (but still has the same PA248U model number on back), and is much more dependent on airflow from underneath. This means that as soon as you place it on an sofa arm or pillow or something, it will immediately start to audibly strain. However, it does provide a lot of airflow when unconstrained on a table or desk.But the final straw came when one of the fan blades started making a scraping noise. I lifted my computer up to see what was happening and - I kid you not - one of the fan blades came shooting out of the unit and landed two feet to my left. This thing was pointy and sharp and could have taken an eye out - if you're lucky enough to have it come out the top!I want my old silver one back... This one is being returned."
4,Good,"great Fan and cooling, have had to replace the cord twice..perhaps because I use it for hours each day."
2,Cheap electrical connections ruin an otherwise okay chill mat,"The design of the targus product is fine, but cheap electrical connections and cheap fans limit the life of this product to a few months if used regularly. It does keep the laptop sufficiently cool to alleviate overheating. The Antec mat is better for about the same price."
1,bad connection,"I own two of these laptop coolers. Bought at the same time and used with two different laptops. Both have the same problem. After about one month of use, the socket on the cooling pad works loose, so the device no longer receives power and the fans stop working. The fans do an excellent job of cooling both laptop and lap until the hardware fails.If I could figure out how to crack the case, I might try to repair these devices. Instead, I'm shopping for another brand with better construction."
2,Power Cord issues after a few months,"This fan was easy to setup and use. It did a great job cooling off my Thinkpad T60p. But, after only a few months of fairly normal usage (no drops/excessive wear/etc) the power cord connection went bad - I even tried taping it into place to hold it in better, but it didn't work for long.Also, the plastic fins on the fan can get bent - not sure how, but they do. And then they catch, making that fan not work (there are 2). I've gone in and fixed it - mostly by removing the bent fin."
3,too loud,"when i first got this cooler, it worked fine, except that it was really loud. it was really noticeable from when it was turned on and off. it did cool my laptop though so i was ok with it. after a year, the plug doesnt work anymore, i have to jiggle it into place and make sure it stays a certain way or else it will come out. im considering buying a brand thats surface is metal so it stays cool naturally. i dont understand why these coolers only have 2 fans that are directed toward the middle when the fans on a laptop are located on various areas of the laptop. also, the cooler has small vents on the side which i think is stupid because they barely release any air. i suppose after one year i should let the cooler retire, but i couldve found a similar priced, quieter cooler that also has a longer life."
2,Worked for a couple months.,"I bought this product as a precautionary measure for my new laptop since I had one burn out on me. It worked well for a couple months with minimal use. The first problem occured when one of the fan blades broke off while in use. I was able to shake the piece out of the way (since I couldn't get the unit open) and continue to use it. Soon after, the power ""thingy"" (place on the cooling pad where you plug the USB adapter in to get power) became loose. I had to hold it in just the right place for it to operate. Now it doesn't operate at all and I just use it to protect my lap. I would not reccomend this product."
4,"Targus Laptop ""Chill Pad""","I think ""cooler"" would be a better word to use in describing this item. It's fairly quiet and seems to do the job of cooling not chilling. Must be used with the AC adapter or you get zip for battery life.....like you are running two fans. For the money, it's perfect. My iBook G4 fits on it perfectly. I'm sure it helps to deter wear and tear on the ""innereds""."
3,just OK,the chill pad was thicker and louder than i expected. i also did not notice any heat difference in my laptop. ive seen better products out there for around the same price. i ended up returning mine.
1,better off investing in a more expensive fan,"I am very dissapointed with this fan, it worked great for a few months, then it broke down, I had it replaced, then it broke down again, it was then replaced a second time, and now it has broken down yet again. Customer service at targus is great, however to replace it each time is $5 (pay for shipping) and at this rate I have spent as much as a more durable one would have cost me.Pros:when it is working properly, it keeps your laptop very cool.Cons:-It is flimsy, I don't recommend it for laptops over 5 lbs-The cable is what has been breaking down on me, so its obviously cheap-The rubbers fall off that hold the notebook up at an angle-it is made of very cheap plasticLike I said its good when its working, but dont expect this to last you over a year."
4,Different model,"The item I received was black and looks a ""tad"" different but it serves its purpose well. A little noisy but the price was right. Bought it at $14.99 Lightening Deal offer."
1,WORST COOLING PRODUCTS EVER!!,"I bought this item originally from Wal-Mart. This is my FOURTH one in a little over a year. Every one I have had has died within 4 months. So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one, or buy a new one and return the broken one. Then it looked like Targus redesigned the PA248U because even though the model number was the same, they changed the casing completely and added an on/off button. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, so I got it. It was improved. Now it doesn't die outright. The fans will just stall out until you move the mat around and angle it up until the fans will restart. And to get warranty service, you have to pay to ship it back to them. But it costs over half as much to do that as it does to buy a brand new unit."
2,actual product model delivered is not of the pictured shown on amazon,I received a targus chill pad that was different from the one being shown by the seller. seller needs to update the image. chill mate cools the laptop but it is noisy. the fan noise can become annoying over time. I would not recommend this model.
2,Targus PA248U,"This products is not recommended for PC 15 inch, the service for Amazon is Good, Thank you"
4,awesome coolpad targus pa241u,"Feel very comfortable using it. Very light and well built.Provides bushes for height adjustment for Laptops such as 17'' ones. Freely dissipates the heat generated by laptop by natural flow of air.Good angle to type.Must buy for any laptop size ,especially for 15 or higher.Thank youAditya Maturi"
2,Would be good if it didn't break,Bought this online from eforcecity. It's a nice powerful fan if you have a really hot laptop. Unfortunately within a day of getting it pieces of the fan began breaking off. Then 3 and a half months later the connection that powers the fan from the computer broke off.
1,The USB cable is a piece of crap,"The pad cools better than nothing, but the chord that connects to your laptop is terrible. I've gone through at least 4 of them over the last year. Consistently the part of the cable that connects from the cool pad to the on/off switch has a break in it. All I do is wrap up the cable, put it in my bag, and otherwise use the device on my lap. I'm not sure how to limit its exposure much more. Only good thing is Targus will replace the cable for you, but it takes a few weeks to receive.Also, the rubber nubs that hold the laptop in place are often lost with no replacements readily available. I'm looking for a better product at this time..."
1,Does NOT work,"The PodiumPad by Road Tools (rebranded as Targus) is the big sibling of Coolpad. Basically it just has adjustable rubber balls as opposed to fixed ones on the Coolpad. Neither one works at all when it comes down to cooling down your laptop computer. It's also very inconvenient to type on the laptop when placed on the Podiumpad, and adjusting the height of the rubber thingies is a pain. Do not waste your money. Search for a product called Bytecc Notebook Cooler ...which is cheaper and has built-in fans which actually cool down your computer."
2,Not recommend if yours is a heavy duty laptop,"I used this product to cool my laptop which is a server. Therefore I ran this notebook cooler for 24 hours a day. After running it for 3 months, I realized that one of the fan slowed down. A month later, the fan stopped running.Overall, I don't recommend this product. The cooling power is not strong enough especially yours is a heavy duty laptop. I recommend the one from AntecAntec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler. I've run mine for 2 years non-stop. So far it still works great."
1,Broke after two weeks-don't buy this!,"This worked great for two weeks and then just stopped working. I fiddled with the cord and it started again. Then it stopped and completely died. Don't buy this, it is something about the connection cord that is defective and quits working. If there was a way to rate it at zero stars, I would."
2,"Worked for a few months, until it broke","The chill pad worked great for my HP Pavilion that had been overheating on a regular basis. Then one day the fans stopped running, and the on/off switch didn't work. My husband, a mechanical engineer, determined that the problem was that there was a break in the metal wires. I think I'm going to try another model that doesn't involve mechanical parts..."
2,"Good cooling, but not a reliable product","The first one stopped working for no apparent reason after about one year. The second one is way too noisy. This means that the third one will definitely be a different brand. Too bad, as this model is cheap, lightweight and it does the job... as long as it works."
1,Flimsy and poorly constructed,"This chill pad worked for about 2 months before I ran into problems. I found that I had to wiggle the power cord where it plugged into the chill mat (on the side) in order for the fans to come on. Within a week, I couldn't get power to flow to the chill mat at all."
5,My Dell notebook used to overheat all the time,"Works great! My Dell notebook used to overheat all the time, but now I canwork without interruptions. I am extremely satisfied."
2,Not as cool as I thought,"The cooler is a help, but no shortage of heat still produced. It's smaller than the laptop as expected, but not by much (dell 1705)."
2,Can't say I recommend this.,"I should have checked here first, too. I bought this through Officemax less than a year ago and it worked well while it worked, but after less than a year, it's now dead. For $[...]in plastic and motors, I expect better than a one year obsolescence. I won't be buying this brand again."
3,Not a tornado,"Well, the unit operates. But as you can expect, it does not have much air flow. And the fans blow down and out the back or front, depending on how you place it. My computer (Toshiba Satellite) wants the air to go UP from below, not down. So I could not use the Tornado on my lap. I can use it on a desk and prop my laptop on the exit side. But the bottom line is that it did me no good. In the end the solution to my laptop overheating was to take my home vacuum and suck the lint back out through the fans. It runs cool as a cucumber now!Good Luck"
2,Cheap quality,"Mine did help keep my Dell Inspiron 8500 from getting too hot, but the USB cable leaves a lot to be desired. About a month after getting mine, the fans stopped working. I found the problem to be in the silly on/off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable. I removed the switch and spliced the cable. However, now, approximately six months after I bought the unit, it appears that a wire has broken near the USB plug, and as far as I know, replacement USB plugs aren't available. I guess now it's buy a 5V AC adaptor and wire into the thing. Needless to say, I'm not impressed."
4,Targus Chill Pad,"The pad works just as described, the only thing I have had trouble with is the power connection on the pad. When you attempt to remove the cord from the pad it pulls the entire unit (power cord assembly) out. Otherwise great."
3,not as good as others said,"got it and used it, the result is not as good as others said. it is ok product, but not great."
3,Does the job well - just not very long,"This is my second purchase of this chill pad. The first one, I had bought and used for a year before the USB cable cord somehow couldn't work anymore. I then bought this second one, played around with a few combinations between the old and new pads and found out that the problem lay in the cord. The new cord works with the old pad, so I'm guessing that a wire in the cord got loose? So if you pad doesn't work anymore, just try to find a cord that is comaptible with the pad instead of buying the pad again. Anyways, I think I've said the word ""cord"" too many times in this review."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this when it came out, it was very expensive and it broke within 2 months! Very terrible quality, do not buy!"
2,not recommended,"The good : it does the job, provides cooling as expected for this price range product.The bad : Exceptionally noisy. I just installed Cooler Master and I thought it was broken because I could not hear it! Targus was running like a motorcycle.Inferior quality. The left fan is malfunctioning, smell of burning PVC. Unfortunately out of warranty. If you can afford an expensive laptop worth cooling, you can afford a better cooling pad.Let me put this piece of junk into the garbage bag."
1,IT'S CHEAP,"I brought it because I needed it but the complaints about the openings being to much in the center is an issue. I remedy the situation by off setting the laptop off the fan to where one of the fans blew into the side where the laptop fan opening is located. The fan started off great but it stopped working, the cord has some type of shortage. Many times I have to plug the cord in order for the fan to move. Sometimes one fan would be moving while the other was still. Upside it is cheap, downside it will stop working and you would have wasted money on it."
3,Blows down,"In addition to this item, I also own the ""Laptop Notebook Cooler Pad w/ 3 Fans"" that's about the same price as this, and the ""Antec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler"" that's currently about triple the price. I place them under stereo equipment that has problems with overheating. Unlike the other two units, this pad sucks air from the top of the unit and then blows it out the back. This is less effective than blowing up and through my units, and they are noticeably hotter with this unit than with either of the others. However, if your laptop fan blows down this unit might work for you by pulling away the air the fan is blowing out."
2,"Great chill pad, too bad it died after 5 months!","This Targus did a great job keeping my notebook cool. Unfortunately, it died for no apparent reason after only 5 months of use. It never left my home. I kept it in my laptop backpack and babied it as I do all my computer equipment. It looks brand new, too bad it's a useless piece o' crap. Shame on Targus, I specifically bought it for the Targus name, thinking it would be dependable! What a waste of money...."
4,Targus PA239U Targus Traveler CoolPad,Good item to help keep your lap top from getting too hot. A necessity for lap top computers
1,Very Unsatisfactory,"I bought not one, but two chill mats for household computers.Neither one lasted more than two months. The connection plug from the USB port to the mat broke down in both instances. While the connection plug worked, it was fine, but this is a serious issue with the product.I discourage buying this chill pad."
3,"Too small for 17"" notebook !!!","I bought this along with case and returned next day, because base is too small and can't work right with notebook I have."
3,Okay for awhile,I've gone through 2 of these with a Dell notebook. It is definitly not a long-term solution to an overheating problem or a preventative measure. I would recommend only using it if you are just trying to get your notebook to last a few months longer until you can replace it.
1,VERY SMALL,"It's a small unit. I have a 15"" Macbook Pro and I can't use it. I'm just gonna give it to someone with a Macbook. I whish they made them to work with a 15 or 17"" Macbook Pro."
1,Waste of Money,"Targus PA248U Notebook Chill PadThis product is a waste of money! No matter if I use my laptop for a little while or for a long period of time. It still I have had the pad for about 11 months and it always has a problem. The fans don't even line up with ANY laptop's internal fan! The wire is cheapy and therefore you have to pinch, move it around, tug on it for the connection to be made! Don't waste your money! Buy any other cooling pad with larger fans and even on an incline, which allows for best airflow."
1,"Short term results, then complete letdown","This fan was great for the first 3 months of so with daily use, but today it just fell apart. The power chord connecting to the fan, became dislodged from the input. In other words, the chord randomly separated and ceased to work. I suppose you get what you pay for, and I am convinced spending an extra ten dollars will be worth it in the long run."
4,"Works very well for the price, good starting point.","If you don't have a lot of money but have a hot Dell like me you're going to want to buy this. It does make a huge difference in cooling down the computer. I recommend turning it on before you turn on your computer, it works much better if you give it a head start. If you play games or are just on the computer for long periods of time this is a great way for the money to cool down your computer."
2,Very noisy,"I bought the Targus PA248U Chillpad. The fan is very noisy and after a week, the left side fan is making a loud buzzing noise. Got it for a great price ($13), but wouldn't buy it again. We have a Targus PA248UX for another laptop. Its much better."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I've had this cooling pad for a couple of months now, and I haven't had a problem with it yet. I like to have my laptop on my bed when I'm at home, and it used to be a problem with the heat that it generated. I used to prop up my laptop on books and have a fan blow underneath it to try and cool it off, but it didn't work. After a while I couldn't deal with the heat, and I went out and bought this chill pad. I have to say that it has made it so my laptop is completely cool (just like it is when it is off), and I never have a problem with using my laptop in bed anymore. At first it feels kind of cheap and that you could break it very easily, but it is surprisingly sturdy and has no problem supporting my laptop. Overall this has exceeded my expectations with no problems, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
4,The short of it.,"I have an HP dv9000 that I use daily for rendering video and playing games. The laptop was running hot, to the point of lock ups and hard reboots. I bought this product, my first cooling pad, and it has done the job well.I agree with ""monkeyboy"" in that it would be nice to have the fans further back, but with some trial and error, I found the right spot to get maximum cooling."
1,Dead on arrival,"This is my second Targus chill mat and my last. The first one lasted 9 months and even though it was still under warranty, I didn't bother to return it. I think they count on it being too much of a hassle. While it was working, I usually had to jiggle the power cord to get the fans going. The second chill mat didn't work from day one. Not even blowing on the fans made them move. Returning to seller for refund. Any suggestions for a replacement?Note: item pictured (and ordered) is not what I received. Actually received PA248YO3U with a sticker attached to package with upc code for PA248U."
5,Targus chill pad,I love the Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad. It does all that I had anticipated it would do and I would highly recommend it!
2,Great Until It Stops Working,"I actually loved this item, so you can imagine how sad I was when it stopped working.I have purchased laptop cooling pads from different companies and unfortunately none of them have worked for more than a few months.I chalk it up to cheap products made in China.If anyone has purchased a laptop cooling pad that has lasted and is still going strong, please let me know."
2,Not what it seems,"This product is not as show or described. It looks like a replacement for the Targus Chill Pad that goes into a lap-stand. The model shown is a great Chill Pad that has high speed fans and fits into the Targus stands. However this model is super thin is low speed fans. There is also no room to vent the heat out the sides or top or allow cool air to be blown by the fans. The fans also began to freeze up after a week of use. I ordered two and regret it. Don't let the fake picture fool you, this is a low model of Chill Pad and is poorly designed. There are much better models out there, such as the actual one pictured."
3,fragile,"It works, sure, but it's thin plastic with a small on off button that broke within the first week of use."
2,SUCKS!,"I've had the Targus Chill Pad for about 2 months now, and I say thumbs down. Money can be spent on a more worthy cooler. The adapter part that plugs into the cooling pad often gets to have a poor connection, thus shutting off the fans. Also, plastic = bad. Heat dissipation was alright when I first bought it, but now...it's not performing up to task. Why?! THE FANS BLADES BROKE OFF!!! The left fan is missing one blade and the right fan is missing two blades! Like I said... plastic = bad. Spend your money on an aluminum cooling pad..preferably with ball-bearing fans.Research before you buy!!!"
2,Ehh...,"I bought one of these shortly after Christmas to keep my laptop cool. Although it did a good job of keeping my laptop from overheating, I was very dissatisfied with the cord.I have had to return it twice in less than two months because of breaks in the cord, once by the on/off switch, once by the plug."
2,Not happy,At first the chill pad worked really well and kept my notebook cool. But the fans stopped working after only a month. I was not happy with the product.
5,DVD's were poor quality. Give us blu-ray!,"Love Babylon 5! it is a classic, but the DVD's were disappointing quality. Hoping for the blu-ray treatment soon and that they do it right."
5,5 Stars!,"""The Venus Wars"" was one of the best anime movies I have ever watched. It was well worth my time and it ranks right up there with ""Tenchi Muyo! in Love."" If your into fantasy, Sci-Fi Romance . . . Watch this movie!"
3,It's OK,"This movie reminds me of Akira, though it's really that good. It is a film worth the money but Akira And Ghost in the shell are still THE GREATEST MANGA EVER MADE"
3,Not bad,"Not a bad piece of anime, certainly superior to the inept Big Wars, which followed a similar plot. Very well acted for an anime, but the characters lack any small amountof appeal."
3,Not Robotech style action but entertaining.,"Is a good anime because is HIGH BUGET ACTION-PACKED. But it wasn't cool as Robotech (Macross), the action scenes weren't THAT fast, the kid (main character) doesn't shoot to many bad guys with his ""battle-motorcycle"" and there wasn't to much battle war shooting like in Robotech.The action is top notch because the motorcycle runnings were cool, and the action scenes are very reailistic with tons of shooting but not on the battle wars (only on the normal action scenes). And of course, the drama is great with an easy storyline to follow.The dvd wasn't good because the anime wasn't remastered, so the colors can be dark and annoying sometimes.Adios."
3,Boy To Man In Half an Hour,"There are a lot of characters in this cartoon. So, I am expecting some sort of id-ego-superego (or what the other one called?) kinda model used in many American movies. like... One character represents the ego, another represents the id and the other represents the superego. However, this is not the case. Character development is very little. The boy is a kid and then half an hour later, he is a man... with little development at all. It is like they cut away a big piece of the cartoon right in the middle. And I think this is what this cartoon is all about: from boy to man and becomes a hero. The story does not focus much on the other characters either.On the other hand, the animation is very good. It is one of the best looking cartoon I have seen.So, to sum it up, if you look at this as an epic movie, it is a bad epic movie with a little bit of action. If you look at this as an action flick, it is pretty good action movie but it is very short."
1,Lego table,"When we received this lego table, it was made for the larger sized legos which wasn't evident by the photo. To return this table, it took several phone calls to get the appropriate approval to return the table for a discounted credit."
2,Ho-hum evil aliens destroy civilization and then get zapped,"I bought this book because I bought the first book (yeah, I know not a real good excuse). You have the evil Sauron, which are basically beetles on steroids, The Ra Na, which a furry little dwarfs and a collection of human refugees.Humanity has been reduced to 3 billion souls. The only kind of religious fever that could survive in this apocalyptic world are white racists.Most of the action is confined to a revolt on the rbiting fleet and what remains of Washington State. (I don't know what happened to the rest of the world, but the last time I checked there were people in Asia, Africa and Europe).Of course, the bugs (as they are called) have a weakness, and the good guys manage to wipe them out.There are good aliens-invade-the-earth-and mankind-wipes-them-out books, this just wasn't one of them."
3,Good fun,There were many stories in these two books. Many of which take place in Sauron ships dealing with different aspects of the alien society. I enjoyed the story of Ivory and the white racialists. Ivory starts out as a big time loser and ends up a decent leader (misguided racist pig but a decent leader).I must say that the last third of the book was somewhat of a let down. Maybe too predictable I am not sure.
2,Repeats,The Show Is Great But It Is Only One Episode That Was Already Released In The Ultimate Collection ......Beware
2,Disappointing!,"Mixed race relationships are a big issue today. The recent imbroglio over Sen. Strom Thurmond's half Black daughter reveals the interest in the subject. Professor Randall Kennedy's book, however,is simply a string of stories that already have been told. Although well written, the book lacks a common thread and it reads like a lengthy monologue about interracial relationships. I find Rachel Moran's book Interracial Intimacy, with which I do not agree with on many points, much more thoughtful, enlightening, and challenging intellectually. Unlike Kennedy, Moran looks well beyond Black/white relationships. In this way, Kennedy appears to have been caught in a time warp."
3,it records but has no cursor control,"Targus is touting the product as the newst item on their website, stating that they are the first who came out with a recorder+presenter. It works fine. It has volume control, and the usb is tucked inside the handle for storage. But it product lacks mouse control. So someone doing prsentations that require mouse clicking has to approach the computer and move controls manually. It would have been useful if Targus pointed this out rather than create hassles for people who must return it.Also, the recorded voice quality is not very good. The movements of the hands are recorded and interfere with the comprehension of the voice.The utility of the product depends on different people's needs."
1,It was broken when I tested it.,"It was broken. I cannot use it to control slides. Since I live in Thailand, I cannot return it easily compare to cost shipping from Thailand to USA.I called Targus USA about warranty; they said that I need to ship it back to USA only. I then called Targus Thailand; no one receive my call. I left the message at Targus Thailand; no one call back like it said ""please leave the message we will call you back"":(I would not recommend anyone to buy this model at all.ps. I bought it because it was the cheapeste one for Targus. I am so disappointed:("
1,You get what you pay for!!,"This product is horribly designed. I was trying to replace another Targus model presentation tool but opted for this one. I have not been able to set it up and have tried on several computers. In addition to the basic functions, there is no indicator light to allow the user to know if the item was properly paired."
4,Works Just Fine,"It works well. Sound quality of recording isn't great, but functional. Certainly not abysmal - well worth the price I paid for it ($10)."
2,More novelty than anything else,"I bought the Jabra for the express purpose of using it while my phone was 15-20 feet away on my desk. I experienced heavy static from that distance (despite an advertised 30 foot range). Also, when the side of my head with the Jabra on it was facing the phone, I got better reception than when I turned away. I am, apparently, thick headed.Using the Jabra in the car was an awesome experience, since the phone was so close to me. There were no wires to interfere with my driving, and I could answer calls easily with the Jabra itself, never even touching the phone.But $80 is too much to pay for wireless convenience in a car. Until the technology improves or price drops, the Jabra is just not as vaulable as a simple wired handsfree device. I returned my Jabra after one week."
2,Very poor battery life,"The Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not ready to be utilized in the business enviroment. I have used it for three months with the new Sanyo Multimedia 7400 phone, I found: a VERY SHORT battery life, average reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 10 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive noise in the background when a moderate wind is blowing."
2,Lifetime of unreplacable battery: just beyond 1 yr warranty,"I got a BT200 (appears to be nearly the same as the BT250) 15 months ago. It worked well and I liked it a lot despite annoying background clicking and short battery life. Now, after just over a year, its battery often won't last a day of standby let alone conversations. Jabra support says they have no spare parts or service and offered me a 20% discount on a new one. In other words, beware that this is a disposable product! I also have a BT-110, which uses a AAA cell that has much longer life and can be removed for recharge and/or replacement."
4,"Great Device, has some problems","I got this after i sold my BT200.. well i can say i'm not having the range issues as the people in the other review say..the only problem i have is that after leaving it a while it goes dead, even if it is off.. i dont know what its problem is but i have it sitting there and i dont know if its charging becuase the blue led isnt lit up :("
5,Works great as others reviewers indicate,"I just got this headset with my new Treo 650 phone, and it works fine. The pairing process is fairly simple, there are two versions supplied in the book to allow for different capabilities in various phones. I've never used a Bluetooth headset before this one, so I can't compare to other models, but sound quality and usability seems great.It does take some getting used to in terms of how you put it on your ear, but not overly so. I can definitely recommend this product."
3,Jabra FreeSpeak Headset,"Jarba FreeSpeak is a great headset for 2 1/2 years, after that the battery dies.This is where the bad part comes in. YOU CAN NOT REPLACE THE BATTERY!So, keep this in mind when buying one. I found out the hard way."
3,pity it did not live for longer,"The BT250 worked well for about a year, however it simply stopped working...just outside of the warranty period...and of course Jabra would not help. So now I'll go and buy someone else's product as I expect a device like this to last longer than the warranty period"
3,"Very Reliable, with drawbacks","I owned the 250v for 3 years! and if the piece that held the eargel on hadn't broken I wouldn't be in the market for a new one. This unit is great, with some inconvenient drawbacks. First, turning this thing on and off is supposed to be a matter of holding the multi-function button for 5-10 sec. Good luck with that one....I never turned it off because I couldn't. Also there is a tiny blue strobe on this thing that let's you know its on. Yeah not a great feature when its stays lit constantly while it charges on my night stand. I can't speak for its standby or talk time because I charged it nightly and had a car charger for long trips, but I never ran out of juice either. Would I buy it again?....Yep, its too comfortable to pass up."
2,FreeSpeak 250 - Not That Great,"I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however, the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not all that great. With regular usage for three months with my Sony Ericsson T637, I found: a very short battery life, mediocre reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 7 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive static in the background and that it was hard to hear me.This technology could be great, but its a little overrated right now with the cell phone accessories that are currently available. I have had good luck with previous Jabra products and this one, the FreeSpeak, is just disappointing. Maybe I will try this again in a few years. For now, it's back to the ""wired"" headset."
3,I guess I must be in the minority,"I've had my 250 for about three months now. While I realize this hardly makes me an expert or a Bluetooth elite, I am not that enthused with this headset.In the first place, the general feeling I get when handling it, is that it is of marginal construction and ""quality"" was, perhaps, sacrificed to get a unit out on the market.While I will say that it is very comfortable to wear, it fails in one major area - that of ""user"" volume. I am forever being told that I cannot be heard or that my audio is so low as to be almost a whisper. I didn't buy a headset so I could stand in the corner and yell into my phone; I've seen enough of these ""ego heads"" doing that in airports and restaurants; talking so loud as though everyone should be interested in their conversation.So I am actively looking again. Maybe the thing to do is just to wait it out and see if SOMEONE can't come up with a headset that is comfortable to wear that actually performs as it says it will."
3,Doesn't fit securely,"I like the operation, but not the fit. The eargel falls below my ear canal, and therefore falls off too easily - it would be better if it were adjustable to different size ears."
2,Lots of static and white noise,"I thought the Jabra FreeSpeak would be a much better bluetooth headset than a lot of other products on the market. Boy was I wrong! Once I got started with the headset, I heard a lot of static on my end and the people I called could barely hear anything I was saying.Heaven help you if you have an 802.11x setup at home! I have a wireless network at home which seemed to cause a lot of interference with my headset. Even when I tried the headset on the road or elsewhere, the static was unbearable. You could barely keep the headset 1 foot away from your phone before you started hearing static.I returned this puppy back to Best Buy the very next day.I have since purchased the Bluetooth headset from Logitech which works GREAT!!Note: I have a Sprint PPC-6601 phone"
4,Generally happy,"I have been using this device for two months, and have been generally happy with it - the audio fidelity is good, the unit is comfortable, the battery life is long and, although I haven't tested the maximum range, I usually use it at 10 to 12 feet from the phone (Nokia 6820). My house is in a marginal reception area for Cingular, and using the headset allows me to put the phone in a ""sweet spot"" with an unusual orientation, giving me three or four bars instead of one.The ""belt clip"" is a joke."
3,NOT COMFORTABLE,"In general I am okay with this headset, I am using it with a TREO 650 which lends itself to other issues, the headset is not advanced enough to work automatically with the treo. My main complaint is it is not adjustable to my ear. I actually have to use the big ear gel to get it to stay on because the part that goes over your hear is about 1 cm too high over my ear, so the big ear gel holds it up.... It fits my husband perfectly, so maybe it is that I have smaller ears, it just seems to me that there should be a better way to make it fit."
1,one star is too good for this junk...,"cracked body twice and reception for both was problematic at best.crack on the body is one thing because it still works...the call button after 6 months broke, this was on the replacement and they don't replace warrantee replacement item. ear gel piece come off and gets lost easy. too heavy and uncomfortable compared to whats out there. you can hear fine...but it's mic or transmission is very noisy and full of static. I recommend the g2.what a waste of my hard earned money!!!"
2,poor quality product!,"I loved the idea of wireless for the convenience and safety and was loving the Jabra until it fell apart on me. The distance from your headset to the cell was definitely short range, maybe a few feet away before it got fuzzy. What was worse is that after 4 months of owning it, the earpiece (that holds the rubber plug) broke off and the headset surface started fading. The piece breaking off meant I could not put a earplug on there and it was not covered in the warranty (the customer service suggested I super glue it!) I bought another Jabra thinking the last one was a fluke...but other things started falling apart. Very poor quality piece...I would rethink buying this product!"
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"I have used this headset with my Treo 650 and have been very disapointed with it's performance. It may be a function of the Treo's Bluetooth capabilities so keep that in mind and do not waste your money on this headset if you are using a Treo.It has very poor range; arm's length at best. Outdoors it is useless. It has times when it will refuse to pick up a call. The voice quality is also poor with hissing and crackling. The only place it seems to be remotely useful is in the car where it is within arm's reach and the hissing is only moderate. This is pretty expensive to only be able to use part of the time. Talk time is also much shorter than advertised.My $.02, save your money for something else.Update: Recently purchased the new Treo 650 headset by PalmOne. That is the new Bluetooth 1.2 version, not the clone of this Jabra. Much, much better. Now I have a headset that I can use all the time. I have completely replaced all my wired headsets."
2,"Neat concept, imperfect implementation","I have 2 of these headsets for a Sony Ericsson t637.I second other reviewers regarding poor range. The phone has to be in line of sight, within a few feet. If the phone is in mypant pocket, reception is marginal.Also: I am unable to use it to record my voice tags. I have read other reviews compalining about this.When I am voice dialing a phone book entry with multiple numbers,I do not get any audio feedback that the phone is waiting for meto say(e.g) ""home"" or ""work"" to select one of the numbers.I find it pratically unusable for voice dialing while driving.I guess for better voice tag matching, you would have to record your voice tags in the car, using the Jabra which seems to beout (see above).Oh by the way, the phone uses battery power at a much faster ratewhen connected to the headset, i.e enabling bluetooth increasespower consumption."
4,Comfy thought provoking book,"A most interesting read, which gives ideas on how to be a caring individual, quotes from Einstein and the Bible that you may not find familiar, and enough character details and mystery plot to keep you involved. I just reread it, and found details I'd not noticed the first time through."
3,Cute Shoes but....,"I have to say, I was excited to get a really cute, funky KC summer shoe but let me tell you, these ""suckers"" hurt. If you wear a 9, get a 10...run on the small side. Otherwise, you're getting a fabulous design, great shoe, pretty colors (esp. in Chocolate)for the price.Enjoy shoe shoppers :)"
3,Pretty nice,"Nice padding and nice feel to them but why do all of these snowboarding/ski socks have to go passed your knee? Seriously, that is ridiculous. I'm almost 6'-0"" tall and do not have short legs yet all these ""over the calf"" socks are really thigh highs. They really need to make them just an inch or two shorter."
1,This book is a copy!!..,"This seller sent me a copy, this book has no table of contents, it is clear which is a copy and not an original book!"
3,Quality Isn't The Best!,"Although the packaging was fine, and the product arrived on time, I was very disappointed with the quality of the series. Some parts of the disks seemed lots darker than others. However, I'm satisfied with the price, and will keep the product. John S."
4,Nostalgia,"I vividly remember this series from watching it when it first came out. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the sound track CD was included in the package. As will most television recordings from this era, the quality is mediocre at best. Still, it was fun watching them again after all these years; it was a shame that the sponsor killed the very popular series after the first season."
1,Not totally happy,"One of the CD's arrived damaged - cracked and unable to use. It was a gift for my husband which make it worse. Amazon should replace thr CC for me, but to offer so far."
4,Buy this sticker directly from Free Tibet Campaign.,"In 1950, Radio Beijing announced that: ""The task of the People's Liberation Army for 1950 is to liberate Tibet."" That October, 40,000 Chinese troops invaded Tibet. In the more than 50 years since, an estimated 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed by the Chinese. The Chinese destroyed thousands of Buddhist monasteries and established Chinese as the official language of Tibet. Young Tibetans are educated in Chinese schools which have re-written Tibet's history, with references to an independent Tibet omitted. To further their attempted eradication of Tibetan culture, the Chinese have encouraged settlement in Tibet to make the Tibetans the minority population there.The Free Tibet campaign is working for an end to Chinese occupation of Tibet and to free Tibetan political prisoners. I recommend buying the ""Free Tibet"" sticker directly from the ""Free Tibet Campaign"" to you can be sure that the proceeds will go to that cause."
2,1 of every 4 defective,"I normally do not write reviews for items, but, I was so dissatisfied with this product that I felt I should warn others of the quality. I purchased a package of 100 screws, and I am glad that I had plenty extra. I ended up throwing away 1 of every 4 screws. I discovered 2 problems with the screws. The first is that the threads are bad on some of the screws and would not thread into the #8/32 bolts I have. I know it was the screw because another brand I purchased (shorter length) always threaded with no problems. Also for a good screw in this batch they also threaded with no problems. The second problem is that the hex head is not a consistent size. some heads would not accept the hex key in them, being to small, others fit just fine.Good price, but consistent quality is definitely an issue."
4,Superior camera..Instruction book very confusing,"Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3A 7.2MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Blue)This is just a fantastic camera. I have always loved the Panasonic cameras that host the Leica lens. Very sharp and clear. I have yet to figure out, though, all the features, as the instruction book is very confusing compared to other Panasonics I have purchased. The camera is a bit heavy to hold with one hand however the pictures make is worth it.Very fine price and delivery through Amazon."
1,Poor Pix Quality,"Well, the selling feature of 10x optical zoom had me hooked. Unfortunately, the picture quality was terrible(not just the zoom pix). I had a Kodak for 4 years and it took MUCH better pix. My daughter's Olympus had great pix of the same events that I took with the Panasonic. I returned it after using it at a weekend basketball tourney; I purchased a Cannon A710 as a deparation purchase the night before I left for a big trip and was thrilled with the pix quality and features."
3,Lumix TZ3,"A great small digital camera let down by the lack of a viewfinder. I have yet to see any small digital camera with a screen that works in bright, outdoor light. Sadly, the TZ3 is no exception, which is a shame, really, because everything else about this camera (esp. the lens and the image stabliser) is first rate."
5,Excelent,"The best camera in his type.Incredible images, very easy to set up y take the best snap !And, believe it or not... takes SD memory !!!Simply the best."
4,Great camera,"My only complaint is that the LCD screen came with a flaw. If you look at it from certain angles some weird lines appear. But I'm sure it was just mine. Bad luck I guess.Other than that it's amazing considering the price and the size. It's rare to find a camera that fits in your pocket and has such great zoom. The picture quality is great, low light, high light, night shots, even pictures of the night sky are amazing. All in all, it's a really good camera."
3,There is a bug.,"This is a nice point and shoot camera if you are lucky enough to get one where the lens cover does not stick. I have had two of these cameras, both of which worked fine for a couple of weeks, but then developed a problem where the automatic lens cover does not open all the way.It's hugely irritating because you can't even help it open with your finger without touching and smudging the lens. It happens every time it is first turned on. You will see the same complaint from other reviewers. If you buy one of these make sure it's easy to return.Otherwise, pretty good - in daylight, anyway. It's hard to take a decent flash photo with any camera, but with this thing it's probably impossible. I leave the flash disabled since it inevitably blows out every photo if it fires. If there is not enough available light I don't bother with this thing.I'm still looking for the right digital pocket camera."
5,GREAT camera!,"We purchased this camera just before leaving on vacation, so have not spent a lot of time playing around with it or reading the instruction manual. With all that said, this camera takes amazing pictures! The colors are absolutely beautiful and the pictures crisp. The zoom is wonderful also. We were at the Grand Canyon and the pictures that this camera took are comparable to an expensive, professional camera that a friend of ours had with him. Absolutely would recommend this to everyone!"
4,DMC-TZ3,"I just bought this camera a few weeks ago--it's my first digital camera & I really like it. I've owned a Pentax SLR for 30 years, so I wondered whether I could get used to the lack of a viewfinder. Well, it's easier than I thought. I'm starting to work the programs & the incredible zoom. On ""idiot"" mode, I have been taking photos on the fly just to practice. It stops action very well, but I found at maximum zoom, you really do need a tripod to avoid shake. Love the beautiful bright 3"" LCD screen."
4,"It's good camera, but not the best","The camera is OK, I could get nice photos however, till now I'm trying to take a portrait with blurry background, but I can't. I don't know if this is feasible with this camera or not."
3,lumixfan,"I purchased a DMC-TZ3 in 2008, it has been working well. it's easy to use,good quality pictures, the price is good at the time. However until 3 years later, out of blue, the camera does not function right. It only shows the strange image with purple color in LCD. I have contacted Panasonic, seems like it has CCD problem. the camera has passed warranty, I don't know how much will cost to fix.Well if you think $200+ for 3 years is good enough, you may consider buy it. otherwise it's a risk."
1,Very disappointing! Totally unreliable.,"Bought this camera in February 2008. Being very careful about my cameras, I was totally disappointed to realize that, suddenly, last September 2009, the display showed only blurred and purple ""images"". When looking at menus, display was perfect. Diagnostic from Panasonic Service Center: CCD dead! Cost for repair: USD 130.00! (by the way this is the price of a used TZ3 on Amazon). Panasonic, you have lost a customer. We nevertheless decided to have it repaired by the Service Center. Today, in October 2011, after having been used sparingly, the camera again shows the same blurred, purple screen. I liked the lens quality and the 10x zoom range, but now it becomes: ""Panasonic, never again!"""
1,Only 2-year lasting toy,"I bought this camera (panasonic lumix) 2 years ago and its CCD is totally crashed now and shows nothing. Warranty of CCD is 6 month. So, if you want to use a camera for 6 month and ready to trash it, then I recommend you to buy this. The color is unrealistic(Canon was much better), CCD accepts images very slowly, so the camera makes a lot of motion blurs.AdvGood for 1 yearGood for outdoor with bright sunshine10x zoom with bad lensDisDo not work after 1 year (CCD Warranty is 6 month, Panasonic cannot guarantee their product no more than 6 month.)Do not use indoor or in cloudy weatherBad color quality and pixel quality(2MB quality, they may just interpolate the pixel values)."
5,Great camera,"Great camera! Not too bulky, 10x zoom is awesome, and the 3"" screen is bright and clear. Highly recommended."
5,Top of the Pile,"Japanese made, metal body, Leica lens, great price, great pics, low noise.Only other brand is Canon to consider which has probably a better sensor due to Canon's cutting edge CMOS technology giving maybe 1 stop of advantage on the noise stakes. However, in real life I think this Panasonic edges it out on top with the quality lens and overall package. Highly recommended."
4,Lumix DMC-TZ3K,"This camera is an excellent small compact camera which combines wide angle and telephoto capabilities in a small easy to use package. I use it as a travel/vacation camera and at the end of a month, no mechanical problems and great versatility and picture quality. So if you are tired of lugging a SLR and want to have a camera available for the special pictures this may fill the need."
4,Wonderful compact camera with a good zoom,"The Panasonic TZ3 is a great camera to take along with you on any trip. It has a decent zoom in a small package that will fit in a purse or pant pocket. It has a large display which is great for framing your photo as well as reviewing it afterwards. The TZ3 allows you to take a few low-res shots and save them in the internal memory (works well if you want to take a picture of a map or itinerary and not have to worry about losing it when you switch memory cards). The camera is very user friendly, even for those who are afraid of digital cameras, but stills has many features to make a more experienced user happy. All things considered, I have been quite happy with the photo quality, features, and battery life from this camera."
3,"plastic, nylon, or metal gears","Does anyone know what are the gears made of: plastic, nylon, or metal! My Canon Powershot failed too quickly due to gears gone bad. I contacted Panasonic regarding the same question and the reply was that the information is proprietary. Why would a manufacturer wish to hide this information if the product is made of quality components. Anyone with any insight to this, please post a review."
5,superb,"Panasonic did a great job wth this camera: pictures are great, zoom unbeaten in the class, portable...The only objection goes to the cover of the mini USB and battery: plastic made and likely sensitive to mechanical damage. In summary: EIS awarded and the best value for the money in the class.!"
2,"Too bulky, and pics are nothing special","Let me go against the grain here - I ended up selling mine, although there was nothing wrong with it (no defects).I purchased this as a second camera to complement an ""oldie but goodie"" Sony F-707. I thought that the 10x zoom and the smaller size would help me be able to take photos in more places - when I traveled, took walks, etc.But I found that this unit is too big and heavy for a pocket - and I needed to use a hard case to carry it. At that point, it was almost no different than my (very large) F-707, and the photos it takes do not approach the Sony.In short, it was the wrong compromise for me. I suspect this would be a good camera for a lot of people as an ""only"" camera, but it did not fit my needs as a portable. Perhaps I am spoiled by my 6 year old Sony. I will be buying something else for traveling, but it will be ultra small as opposed to the mid-size and weight of this."
4,"Very good, but not for a beginner","I purchased this for my wife, which isn't very good with cameras. She had a hard time getting it setup to take good pictures and changed several setting that caused her to take bad pictures. The camera takes great pictures, once it is setup correctly.I would strongly recommend the camera for anybody that knows a little about photographing.If you are a beginner, do not purchase this camera."
5,Fantastic Little Camera,Great product for the price. I especially like the 10X optical zoom. This was one of the main reason why I decided to get this camera. I'm glad that I got rid of the FinePix F40FD. Great product Panasonic!!!
5,"Wow, great camera",After almost a year of research I picked this camera as the one I wanted. I am not disapointed. I am able to take hand held pix at 15X (the extended zone) and they come out very nice. I have taken pix at 60X on a tripod and they are amazing. This camera does so much more than it says in the write up.The only thing I miss in this camera is a view finder. It would make taking tele pix much easier.
4,Love it!,"This is a great camera. I was going to get a digital SLR camera because I wanted a faster shooting speed, but after researching further I realized everthing I would give up. This is the best compromise between a compact and a larger SLR camera. I love the 10x zoom, it has a nice big LCD monitor to review pictures and position shots. I've become addicted to filming video clips of my kids and sending them to friends and family thru youtube. My only wish is that it could be faster when shooting multiple shots, but I think it is still better than most compacts. Also some pictures seem to come out a bit darker than I would like, but that might be the photographer. I'm a point and shoot kind of person."
4,Extaordinary Zoom Lens,Panasonic has put an extraordinary Leica zoom lens (28-280mm) with excellent optical image stabilization on an average 7 mega pixel camera body. The lens makes the camera very attractive for travel but somewhat larger and heavier than its competition. This is the essence of this new camera and the rest is just commentary.
4,Big features in small package,Great camera..10x super zoom in small package wow!! Plus16:9 format in video and still photos.I use mulit-burst w/ optical zoomon ocean waves crashing on beach for beautiful color images.Deleting photos takes a bit longer than a cannon I own but themulti-delete is very useful.All in all I say its money wellspent considering all the options you get. Just purchase anextra battery(Frys $35) and a 4G card and you can shoot all day..video included.
1,Panasonice and planned obselesence,"The CCD stopped working correctly after about three years, and the cost to replace it is worth more than the camera. You will see that this is a common problem with this camera, even in the reviews here on Amazon. If I had known that Panasonic builds planned obsolescence into their products, even a camera for several hundred dollars, I would not have participated. So now I have a camera that doesn't work and also the guilt of having to find a safe way to get rid of this thing so that it is not clogging up a landfill somewhere. I won't be buying any Panasonic products again.I think I am going to go back to low tech and just build a pin hole camera until the manufacturers can build a camera that will last more than a few years with the expected abuses that a camera will experience. If such a device exists already let me know in the comments. No Panasonic though!"
1,Buyer Beware,"Lumix cameras extremely susceptible to electrolysis from normal household conditions which will result in camera failure -- probably around the time the warranty expires. In my case, it was two weeks after -- Panasonic said to send it for repair to the service center, which contacted me to tell me the charge would be $160 to fix the camera. I reluctantly agreed. Three weeks later the camera was returned along with a note that said it was ""not cost effective for them to repair the camera"", which they did not fix. They included a thank you not with the bill for $160 -- for shipping and diagnosis!!! Beware of Panasonic."
2,Disappointed,"Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K 7.2MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)I wanted so much to like this camera. The 10X zoom is awesome and the LCD screen is huge! The facts are though, that I need to take action shots in low light and this camera was terrible at that. I tried every setting this camera offers (and it offers many) but just couldn't get quality prints out of it. You can forget using the zoom with this camera unless you have a tripod. Who can take around a tripod for action shots? Like I said, I am very disappointed that I couldn't use the camera. However, Amazon stood up to it's excellent return policy and gave me a full refund on the camera, SD card and battery I purchased."
3,"Camera almost great, Panasonic miserable.","Only had camera two months and the lens cover has stopped opening and shutting completely. I have to manually open and shut. However, the pictures, ease of use, etc are really quite impressive.The downside, it seems ridiculous that I have to pay for the shipping to get an under warranty camera repaired. (not too mention needing to get a 2 month old camera repaired). The Panasonic call center and the Panasonic repair center give conflicting instructions on shipping. If you like circular automated customer service, then Panasonic is for you.In summary, as long as the camera works, its great. If you have to deal with Panasonic make sure you have plenty of free time and lots of Advil."
5,Best little camera in the Great Northwest,"This was my second TZ Panasonic camera purchase. Since they both are good,it is difficult to rate one better than the other, but my new TZ3S does topthe TZ1S. Its great 10X wide-angle lens allows me to take interior shotsthat the TZ1 doesn't and it is even easier to set up for bad lighting conditions.As the late Roger Dangerfield would say, ""I don't get no respect"" - well thePanasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3 camera definitely should get its due respect."
4,Pretty Great Camera,"We did a lot of research to find a small camera with a good zoom and good features. The zoom being 10X is the best part of the camera. There are also several shooting modes to choose from for what/where you are shooting. The image stabilization is also a major plus and we can see a major difference. The images don't seem to be great all the time and especially in the dark I think that my Canon A95 was better in quality. All in all, I think for this size camera and the features that it offers, it's about the best you can find."
4,Great Camera,Pros.Small form factor10x optical zoom28mm wide angle7 mpmenus intuitive.simple mode for my son (7years)Cons.formats high capacity (8gb) cards with format unreadable by standard card readers. must use data cable to access.zoom during video can not be changed.
5,Still learning this camera -- but so far very pleased,"I purchased this camera on the recommendation of a camera store sales associate. I have only had it a few weeks, but so far it has met all of my expectations. I love the 10x optical zoom and the picture quality is fantastic. I find that it has a quick response time and the menus have been fairly easy to navigate. There are reviews from more avid camera enthusiasts out there, but from a mother of a 14 month old who takes lots of pictures and has enjoyed dabbling with photography for several years, this has been a great camera so far."
5,Very Capable,"This camera is perfect if you want lots of features in a small package. The 10X zoom is particularly helpful as well as the relatively wide-angle lens (equivalent to 28mm on a 35mm camera). It's easy to use, the large screen is great, especially for ""older"" eyes! The fact that the lens is made by Leica is a real plus. So far, there are no negatives - and I expect that not to change."
4,Lots of features to explore,"My husband I made a quick pic purchase based upon some customer reviews and industry ratings. Everyone was on point. This camera can be a simple, yet effective point and shoot for a true novice but it also has a variety of settings that are fun to play with. We had a lot of fun while in the Dominican Republic using the sports setting to try and catch motorcycle taxis zooming by. We also got great vibrant photos of many beautiful flowers and the wide angle lens allowed us some gorgeous shots of the oceanside and beach. The water looks almost as blue in our photos as it was in real life. The only downside that we've experienced so far, is that when we go to upload new photos to our computer it automatically pulls all of them, which can take a long time if you have many photos stored. However, there may be a simple fix for this that we have not uncovered because neither one of us have bothered much with the manual :)"
5,Great Camera,"Without going into a lot of technical details, this is a fantastic pocket-size camera with enough features and adjustability to satisfy anyone who is less than a professional photographer. Like any product, there are a few photo situations that could be better but not enough to rate this camera as anything less than outstanding...particularly for the cost."
4,Travel photos,We purchased this camera before a vacation trip. We were interested in good zoom capabilities plus being able to carry the camera in a pocket. It has thus far performed very well in all types of settings and lighting conditions. The scene settings are fun to use. We've only had the camera for 6 weeks so our impressions are still forming.
5,Superb Camera,A professional photographer told me about this camera. I've had it three weeks and it's superb in every way. I also have a Nikon SLR system - as a comparison.
4,Outstanding value,"The TZ3 is a fantastic bargain camera, definitely maximizing the price/performance ratio. The Leica lens is the best lens I've ever seen in anything short of an SLR, with zero distortion and no purple fringing. Menus are easy to use. The camera offers burst shooting, exposure compensation and auto-bracketing, an excellent widescreen movie mode (although it can't zoom in movie mode), and can produce 16x9 images with very little cropping.There are two key shortcomings. First, there are no manual settings. Second, noise reduction is heavy handed, producing poor photos with ISO 400 and up. Nevertheless, this is still a great all-around camera, and easily worth much more than its almost $200 price tag."
2,Panasonic Lumix,"While the LCD image is clear and sharp in good light, it is distored in low light and at distances. What good is an ultrazoom lens if you can't see what you are shooting?"
1,Poor Customer Service,"Overall, Panasonic's customer service is atrocious. I would not buy any product from them. Horrible."
4,Panasonic Lumix,Great Product easy to use. Small compact and all the features we need. Much better than the Son we had before
1,So-so camera,"I am used to a responsive camera. I owe a Canon Rebel XT and 30D, but bought this camera based on its reviews. This camera's response time is SLOW. The subject is standing still yet it still has a noticable lag in shooting. This results in mostly lousy shots. The subject blinks (even though I count 1-2-3). Mostly I shoot people. In summary, I have to delete 90% of my shots. Maybe its OK for scenery as the lens is sharp. I don't care how many pixels a sensor has. The camera has to be responsive. I would rate this one star at best. Save your money."
2,Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K 7.2MP,I'm very disappointed with the picture quality of Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K. My 3 year old model Canon PowerShot S70 is still a better camera. Now I'm stack with the bad camera that got great reviews.
3,Beware-no viewfinder!,"Although there is a description of this camera, it takes some careful reading to find that it has NO VIEWFINDER. While this is not a problem some of the time, any picture you try to take in moderate to bright sun is hopeless. There is no way to shield the large screen, so you just point and hope for the best. The reason for the missing viewfinder is the technical configuration to allow it the 10X optical zoom - which is wonderful. I think Panasonic should mention the viewfinder at the beginning of the description of this camera."
5,Digital Camera,"I did a complex research on this Camera before I purchased it. Everything I saw pointed to ""That's the Camera for me"". Since I have now used the Camera, it lives up to all of my expectations. The Camera is easy to hold, easy to use and easy to set different settings. I love the large display. I just love everything about this Camera. I'm glad I did so much research prior to purchasing it. The research gave this novice a wealth of information to compare and decide. The price was very, very competitive. I would highly recommend this Camera to anyone.Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3S 7.2MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)"
4,Panasonic Luminix,"I LOVE this camera. I love the size of the window. I can see what I am shooting easily. I love the fact that I can use the new type of card. I love the fact that I do not have to remember to remove the lens cap. DUH! I love the way it feels in my hands - I can hold onto it since it is not super small. I love the way I can set it on a ""dummies"" setting, or I can really get into taking pictures and learn a lot about taking pictures without having a big camera used by professionals. I really LOVE this camera!!!"
4,Glad I bought it,"I bought this camera because it had the best zoom I could find on a small camera. Now, after returning from a special vacation, I can say I'm extremely happy with my choice. The variety of menu options for picture taking was at first daunting, but after experimenting I was glad I had them. I could take great indoor pictures with the ""warm"" color setting, or outdoor pictures using the ""natural"" color setting, or boost the color on an overcast day using the ""vivid"" color setting - and there are more. The only minor complaint is I noticed a somewhat slow shutter response that caused me to miss a few ""action"" shots - very minor."
2,Poor Picture Quality,"The more I use my TZ3, the less I like it. I cannot take a picture on a nice sunny day without having vertical lines across the horizon. This renders the image useless. Pictures taken using the flash are either totally washed out or they are underexposed. Quality of images taken with low light levels are also poor. This leaves a limited range of lighting conditions where a decent image can be taken.Based on my experiences I would not recommend this camera. There are many positive reviews on Amazon so perhaps my camera is simply defective. I have contacted Panasonic and they will not help me because my camera is out of warranty.We have several older digital cameras including a Kodak and a Canon and they do not exhibit the problems that I have encountered with the TZ3 so I know that what I am experiencing is not normal for digital cameras.I'm at the point where I will soon pitch this camera into the garbage and buy a new camera. However, I doubt that it will be a Panasonic Lumix."
3,Not good for action or low light - otherwise very nice,"Starting off with the bad - unless you use the flash indoors, the pictures are rather dark, or blurry, if anyone, including you, move too much. Taking pictures of my kid's soccer and basketball games were really blurry unless they were basically standing still. The good about it is a great wide-angle and telephoto lens in a small package. Great battery life, nice LCD screen. Good menu's and the buttons on the camera get to common fuctions fast. Overall, a nice point and shoot with a great lens."
4,"good shipping, good product","Very good product, I like all picutres I'm getting with it.I strongly recommend for all point and shoot photographers who wants a 10x optical zoom camera."
5,dmc-tz3,"great camera. easy to use(i have 3 other digitals). lens cover is the weak point, which i knew from other owners, so i found an old plastic lens cover that fit over the whole lens area(nikon 52mm), problem solved!"
1,Camera DMC-TZ3 Rate,Met all my expectations. Excellent stabilization even at 10x. Very good automatic ISO function. This camera is a dream and very easy to use. I had some trouble seeing the LCD screen in bright light. The absence of a viewfinder is noticable but the other features of the camera made it a good trade-off.
5,A great camera,"I had a bit of a problem at first in using the camera because it was more complicated than my old camera. I quickly learned how to use it without reading the manual. The battery is awesome. It lasted for a week with no recharging even though I took well over 100 pictures. The accessories made uploading to my computer a breeze. All of the pictures were clear - even the ones I took with maximum magnification. By the way, I had bought the same camera for my 13 year old granddaughter and asked her for her opinion before I bought one for myself. She loves hers too, obviously."
4,Great pocket camera,"wide angle lens, fast, pocketable, very good quality photos. So, down side: menu and choices not user friendly, Nikon is better for this. Overall, probably one of the better compacts out today, so if you want quality, wide lens advantage, go for it! Just bring your patience and intelligence with to fathom out the menus."
4,only one weakness,"This is a replacement for the same model that was stolen in a mall...ick!I like everything about it (with my 2G memory upgrade) except like many (all?) non-SLR digital cameras, the delay between pushing the shutter button and the actual picture being taken is often painfully long.Much of my picture taking is of my 3yr old twins and unless I pose them (seldom natural looking) I can't get a clear picture even with the anti-blurr feature in this camera. Worse yet, the LCD window lacks the precision to examine the picture to see if the blurr is there or not (unless you zoom the window which takes so much time the enjoyment is gone and naturally, the moment has passed for the kid's activity). So, this is NOT a good camera for action shots.I had an SLR film camera for decades and NEVER got blurred shots as often as I get here. I still like the camera but it's best to stick to still shots unless you like that ""blurred action look"" because that'll be what you get here."
5,"Great music, enjoyable to watch","I have been a fan of Kate Rusby for the better part of her performing career. She performs the trad-folk music extremely well.John McCusker was also a strong performer here as well, and his musical talent shines through this as well. I particularly enjoyed the tune medley.I would highly recommend this to the seasoned Rusby an. However for the others, I would suggest starting with 10 and Hourglass first."
1,Nonplay cd,I ordered two copies of this product and neither would play on either of my cd players. Returning the product was also a hassle. I am not sure that it was ever resolved after all my efforts.
4,Thus ends an era,"Many people will probably give this one five stars because it ends the Mathew Waterhouse era of Who, but I'm one of the few people on the planet(perhaps the galaxy) who liked Adric. This is an emotional ride from start to finsih and one of the Fifth Doctors finest hours. The ending still packs a punch"
2,"""Classic""?!?","This is a workaday pastiche of prior Cybermen episodes, most notably ""Revenge of the Cybermen."" At an apparent loss to add anything novel to the franchise, the writers turn this into a general shoot-em-up, in the process flouting three longstanding traditions in the series:1. Cybermen cannot be shot down; only gold is ""hostile to their function.""2. Firearms will not work in the TARDIS.3. The Doctor does not shoot his enemy with a firearm; certainly not at point-blank range.Robert Holmes was the heart and soul of this TV program. Virtually every story he wrote or edited is worthwhile, and virtually every story that was made without his input is mere flummery (""City of Death"" is the notable exception). His was the ""larger consciousness"" that could breathe life into such wildly improbable characters. Consider ""Revenge of the Cybermen"": Arguably the poorest of the stories that Robert Holmes redacted, it is still far superior to this."
3,Read the fine print...,The band is okay for younger people; kids in particular but it's too small for anyone over the age of 15.
1,DOA ! (Dead On Arrival),"Received this pump (S/N 2065) today. It would not run. Problem was traced to the GFI (ground-fault-interrupter) plug, which was inoperative. Replaced with a normal plug and the pump now runs.Upon disassembly the inside of the GFI plug is found to charred and smells of cooked electrical.I will use this pump with my replacement plug. This is easier than returning it."
4,Works great,"It is refurbished as the item description states so as expected it was not 100% brand new. However, it works just like new and I am very happy with it. It seems to pump very well - so well I sprayed water everywhere at first. As long as you don't mind having a gently used pump this is a great deal."
2,read the whole add,"the item has worked fine but i didnt like the way it was represented nothing about it being a factory reconditioned unit till the very end was my fault for not reading every detail but i still feel it should have been presented at the begining not hide away after the order form , was my first amazon buy and if i ever use it again well read every detail to the very end"
3,Uncle John's,This is one of three Uncle John's books I bought for gifts this year. It is hard to buy for someone that has everything they want. So I gave the gift of humor and maybe even knowledge.
5,"Fresh, tasty soup!","The Soup never sounded better than they do here. The engineering is crisp and the production subtle, yielding a clean, excellent presentation of the guitar rhythms and brass riffs. If only there was a way to sound this clear at the average club gig!Good music of any kind is a matter of working within the limits of a genre and thoroughly exploring them. The dry humor of Dan's lyrics plays well with the brightness and drama of the horns and rhythm section.Very tasty! I'm glad that Amazon and others are giving more exposure to this band."
5,Luxury,"These are very soft and absorbant towels. My husband prefers a rougher towel and wasn't happy with the feel of these at first, but now he likes them. So far these towels seem to get softer and even puffier with each washing. They feel like luxury. Guests love them."
5,"CAPTIVATING, SENSUAL, SUPERBLY WRITTEN","Ms. Jernigan has once again written a well researched, captivating, exciting story. She has brought Elizabeth and Jonathan to life in a story that will warm your heart and soul, as well as other parts of your body. One minute you'll be reaching for your winter coat, the next wishing you were wearing a bikini. Jonathan can warm up my chilblains any day. Once you read it you'll know what I mean. I highly recommend this book. What a great way to start the new year. I can't wait for Ms. Jernigan's next book Dance On The Wind."
4,Beautiful Song!,"I'm a fan of the show Serial Experiments Lain (the anime cartoon) and I must say this is a nice opening song for it. Boa sings a beautiful song with a sort of sweet mellow tune to it, and yet it has a sort of freakish flow. It just fits in great with the show. After listening to it a couple of times you find yourself singing it over and over again because of the great tune. If you like artists like Dido or a beautiful not too loud, not annoying, and sweet gentle voice you'll like this single. All in all it's worth your money and a must buy."
2,Packaging Shotty/Mixed,"The first time I received this item, the box was somewhat torn because the aerosol cans were loosely packed. The second order came in a much smaller package, but the cardboard was paper thin. The package bottomed out after I started to walk it back from the post office, so just be wary.But hey, the aerosol smelled nice and even lasted relatively long. I've recently switched to a solid freshener, because the aerosol sometimes only mixes with bad odors instead of eliminating them. I also have asthma so I think the solid freshener is the better option."
2,Does not spray finely,"This stuff smells nice, but the spray nozzle is worthless. All you'll end up doing is spraying globs of liquid on the ceiling. I thought the first can was perhaps an anomaly, but the second one I tried was just the same."
1,Not your mother's Glade Powder Fresh !,"We used Glade ""Powder Fresh"" (PF) in the vivid blue and white container for years, loved it. Then came the ""NEW Powder Fresh"", washed out/faded colors on the container matched the product now inside. Undoubtably a formulation by the accounting department. It has more of an odor of swamp gas and Chinese Chestnut blossoms than any talcum I've ever smelled.I called S.C. Johnson & Co. thinking they'd run a bad batch. They sent a FREE coupon good for any Glade product. Before I used it I sampled the ""NEW"" PF store product on the shelves and found it was ALL watered down. I left the free coupon for someone to use on another Glade product.Remember when the bean counters at Coke invented the ""NEW Coke"".If you can find an old can of Glade Powder Fresh with the cheery blue sky and clouds on the can, buy it. If you like the old time talcum smell you'll be pleased - treasure it - they don't make it like that any more. PF is now PU."
1,"Perfect in the beginning, Nightmare in the end.","I was a big fan of this scanner until recently.Opticbook scans books fast without damaging spines.I used it very carefully.I used another scanner of mine for non-book materials, because I didn't want to waste the lamp life.The result? The lamp died after around 200 scans!I used it intermittently, so I was out of warranty when the lamp died.I've used scanners of several manufacturers, and this is the first time that a scanner lamp died on me.In sum, $300 for 200 scans is not recommendable at all.Added: I got another reason to hate this scanner. Service of the company is horrible. I sent several emails about my problem, but never got answers."
3,Good for A4 book sccaning. No Vista driver. Bad service.,"Aa long as you have no intention to upgrade to Vista, and if you want to scann books - this is the right scanner. But knoking on the company's door for service, no matter how strong you knok - no body home... All my mails to the company asking about Vista driver were not answered. The scanner is good the service s.........s The Plustek company doesn't understand that good scanner + bad service = bad scanner.I can only imagin what will be my fate if the scanner will for some reason- stop working. In this case my friend turn your plustek 3600 plus into a nice cofee table... I am looking for another scanner...."
3,Hardcover scans only,"A nice fast scanner, it can scan a page in under 10 seconds. I was able to scan a 400 page book in just over an hour. Not bad!BUT... and this is the killer for me... paperback (""mass market edition"") books don't scan very well because the print normally goes all the way to the spine. If you don't mind destroying your book (cracking the spine) then you might be able to do it but I like to keep my books in good condition. This made the scanner useless for my needs.The ""edge"" of this ""edge scanner"" scanning plate isn't quite at the edge of the machine; there's a good lip, which also prevents close scanning of paperback text close to the spine.The OCR software is relatively accurate; it gets confused by large fonts (eg what you sometimes see at the beginning of a chapter) and by fancy headers/footers, but overall not bad."
3,"Great Scanner, Lousy Software","For books, this scanner is awesome - faster than my Epson and my Canon all-in-one. On the other hand, the Epson works much better on photos, and the Canon is best for quick scan to email or to make copies. Mine came with Vista drivers, no problem there.The software, however, is another story. ""It sucks"" is being kind. One of the programs wouldn't even install (I tried on both my XP and Vista machines)and another crashes every hundred pages or so - no help on the website for the software either. Figure on purchasing some OCR software (Abbyy Finereader $400 or Omnipage $450) to get full use of the scanner."
1,Zero Support,"I purchased a Opticbook 3600 plus. Works ""ok"" with XP, but the drivers will not initialize on my Vista laptop. I even took the scanner and laptop into a computer shop and they tried to get it to run on a newly installed Vista system with ZERO success. Calls to the service center go unreturned, and email is not answered. I find it hard to believe Plustek cannot get their scanner to work on Vista, or find a service center in the US that knows the meaning of SERVICE !!"
3,Great introduction to DB2/400 access methods,"As in his seminars, Don Denoncourt attempts to reach two objectives in a very limited time. The first is to teach object-oriented concepts to RPG programmers. He does a pretty good job of this. The second objective, not covered by any other book I am aware of, is to introduce us to the invaluable tools of record-level access and JDBC, as well as PCML and a few other means of interacting with the 400. These sections of the book make it an essential tool for any programmer transitioning AS/400 databases to Java access. I only wish he had included more information on connection strategies such as applets and EJB."
1,They provide NO help,"I bought my unit three months ago and it worked just great - for two uses. Now it doesn't generate any pressure so I may as well just use a hose. I tried their online help twice. Got cut off the first time and waited 45 minutes before hanging up for my second try. I've emailed them 5 times over 5 weeks and have gotten their reply ""We'll get back to you in two days"" - And they don't. Want to escalate your problem? Good luck finding a company address or phone number. Guess they don't want pesty customers bothering them. This was a BAD BUY on my part."
4,Makes tough jobs easy,"It seemed like every place I went another friend had a power washer, so I decided to look at them online. I came across this one, so I bought it. This was a great buy. It has power, 2 nozzles, and its priced right. The best part was when my friends saw what I bought. They all said the same thing. After I took it out, it took them 5 seconds to say, ""No way, yours has a reel for the hose. I sure wished mine came with one.""There has been a oouple of times when I've turned it on and tried using it, and nothing happens. Its like it is just blowing air, but I walk over to it, adjust the washer so its sitting level, and then it works great!!Look around if you want, but for the money and power, you'll be satisfied."
1,Poor workmanship,"I used the powerwasher (1750) right after I purchased it and found the pressure not as ""powerful"" as I hoped it would be. I found the reel not easy to use for the cord. The next time I wanted to use it (recently), I found the clear, short tubing had broken off the washer at the brass fitting and could not use it. I give it a poor rating for water power and workmanship."
3,misleading product description,"Bad:(1)No onboard detergent tank!(2)Onboard storage is useless.(3)The manual is poorly written.(4)When dealing with online powerwasher customer service, who was playing a game and even does not know if the washer has a onboard detergent tank or not. Finally, promise to send me one. Get nothing yet.Good:(1) It works well.(2) Amazon customer service is very good."
1,A visual Heimlich maneuver,"... only someone emerging from total isolation in a cave somewhere, and then being shown ""Showgirls"" as the first movie they had ever seen in their life, would even consider recommending it to someone else (and even then it'd be a stretch). Synopsis? Let's see - horrible acting, terrible and uninteresting plot, unsympathetic characters. In short, the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE. It's a shame Amazon won't let me give this a ZERO STAR RATING because even that is more than it deserves."
1,"Okay, there are worse movies","...Not as unbelievable as ""Pretty Woman"", but certainly better acted than anything Juliet Roberts puts out. Seriously, even as camp, this one stinks"
1,Dreadful!,"Poor writing and bad acting can certainly make for an enjoyable camp romp. Unfortunately, this movie did not manage to achieve that level for me. For the most part, I found the lead female character (""Nomi"") to be unappealing, and disagreeable, which made it impossible to care very much about the story. She was a total turn-off. The lowest point in the entire film however is when the one truly decent human, the lead character's main friend ""Molly"", is brutally raped in a particularly revolting scene. This in turn leads to a completely ridiculous retribution scene dealt out by the wretched ""Nomi"". Which then leads to the best part of this film - THE END."
1,Saved by the bell?,"This movie is a modern day miracle. It is chalk-full of beautiful women and nudity but somehow manages to be anything but sexy. The story is silly. The acting is bad. The sex is not a turn on. I basically rented this movie because I've got a thing for Gina Gershon, yet somehow they managed to make her naked and unsexy. Sigh, I should have just watched 'Bound' again. Don't waste your time."
1,Plan 10 From Las Vegas,"Plan 9 From Outer Space was worse than this steaming pile, but they didn't have the lavish budget to waste that this one did.Every show biz cliche imaginable is dragged out, but in such a clumsy, trying-but-failing-to-be-manipulative way, that your jaw drops to the floor, and you are entertained, almost against your will. Also, there are really spectacular dance scenes, and lots of female flesh for the eyes to feast on.But the story and the dialogue and the direction are stupid. The red haired actor who plays the choreographer also played the Wig Master for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat on an episode of Seinfeld. Kramer somehow misses seeing the show and as consolation, is allowed to walk down Broadway wearing the Tecnicolor Dreamcoat. He is then mistaken for a pimp and arrested. Perhaps that whole sequence was intended as an homage to Showgirls, and one can only wish that Joe Esterhauz could have been arrested for pimpin' this ridiculous movie."
3,Too bad ALL horrible films can't be this good!,"Yes, it was terrible. But hey, Elizabeth Berkley really DOES make a really awesome-looking stripper! And Gina Gershon plays decadence so very well! Whenever she and Berkley were on the screen together, I paid close attention! Other than that, it was mostly awful."
1,And We Wonder Why...,"Why women are continually looked upon as sex object and why they continually get assulted....good grief people, why do we wonder about these things? Women, KEEP YOUR FRICKING CLOTHES ON!"
4,"does anyone know why the ""fully exposed"" edition is rated 'R?'",172 minute R-rated showgrils sounds kind of boring . . .
2,Really inappropriate,"I don't like this film and because of it, it gave me a different perspective of the original as an immature movie.It's great for adults but anyone under 17 don't watch it i guarntee you thatI am 13 years old, so pretty please with a cherry on top, recommend my review PLEEEEEEEEEEASE or else!"
3,Showgirls,"Saw it awhile back,no big deal but since Jesse From Saved The Bell is in it,Why not? Don't expect great acting just Elizabeth Berkley Trying to shock everyone,I guess she wants to save more than the whales!"
2,Trashy goodness.,"Showgirls starring Elizabeth Berkley is complete and utter trash but this film does have cult-status so I give it two stars instead of one. Berkley is no actress, she wasn't even that good on Saved by the Bell. Kyle MacLachlan always plays a creep well but otherwise than that Showgirls lacks sensuality. Horrible film from a good director."
3,An objective observation,"Just from the cover & the title, one would have a fairly accurate idea of its content -- so don't be surprised to see so much exposure & nudity. I haven't seen a live show yet but if this film is as real as it seems to be, then, we don't only have a glimpse of the stage glamour but the bitter truth behind the curtains as well. There's the age-old dream of ""rags to riches"" & the age-old moral of ""what goes around comes around""."
1,The Elizabeth Berkley School of Arm Flinging Acting,"This movie is now promoted as being ""camp"" but not so when it debuted. Even Gina Gershon thought the script was camp, only realizing it wasn't shortly after filming started. Bless her professional heart for not quitting. Liz Berkley is not only an awful actress but a horrible dancer. I lost count the number of times she flung out her arms, either in anger or ""dancing."" Fries over here, ice over there. Her character is supposed to be irrestitable to men & women alike but she looks like a cheap hooker throughout the whole film. Blonde is not her color. And that overbite is not Gene Tieney sexy at all. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers; her body doesn't look so hot when she's naked, which is frequently. I don't know why Joe Eszterhaus hates women so much. His films are very mysoginistic. I will give it credit for one of the best (unintentionally, of course) movie lines ever. I use it as a joke all the time. ""It's a versase."" Versace"
5,Simply the Best!,"I've seen movies like Mildred Pierce to Death in Venice and everything in between, but when people ask me which movie is my favorite, I always answer: Showgirls. My favorite scene is when Nomi Malone is eating a hamburger on top of a terrace and the background is Las Vegas at dusk. Just beautiful!"
1,Showgirls - Disc problems,"I enjoyed the movie even though I was only able to watch it in segments. The first time I tried to watch it, after about 20 minutes, the screen went to digital gibberish and my DVD player hung up so that I couldn't even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power. I had to unplug the DVD player, wait, and replug the power cord to remove the disc. Overnight, I decided I needed to replace my DVD player. However, the next morning, I tried a different DVD and it worked fine. It still works fine on all my other DVDs. I complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of Showgirls. Unfortunately, this one has the same problem. It plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my DVD player. I gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without Showgirls. I use my DVD player almost every day and it works fine except when I try to watch Showgirls."
1,bad acting,Mabey Elizabeth Berkley should go back to Saved By The Bell. OH yeah that show isnt on anymore. Well there is always Taco Bell.
2,"As Pure Camp it's OK, As a Serious Film...It Sucks","The People that like this movie are mainly pervs who love T&A even if there is any point to it or not, my advice go rent a porno. This movie is a fun time for the absolute 100% disaster of it all. The acting is B movie grade, and that even includes Kyle Mchlachlan slumming here(David Lynch come and save him). The story is paper thin and silly, laughably so in fact. This movie received notice only because it was rated NC-17, which is the main reason I have a loathing for this film. True sincere films that also got hit with this rating suffer from the impression that they like this one are simply brain dead gratuitious trash. Movies about strippers and dancers always suck, it's just the way it is. Striptease was even worse than this one, with the exception of Burt Reynolds. Watch this movie only for a good laugh, it's all that it's worth."
3,"Okay, I like this one, so sue me...","i watched it recently on video just to see what the fuss is about to see if it was really that bad...of course, some scenes in the movie are very rank, liz berkeley making a man climax by giving him a lap dance is the ultimate in raunch, but it definately is a turn on ! She definately leaves her ""save by the bell persona"" behind. maybe she just wanted to try something different. the other women in the film are gorgeous too. and you get a good feel for what the life of a showgirl is about...degrading? maybe. but these women knew what they were getting into when they got into this business...this film shows you the sleaziness of the entertainment business in contrast to the women who will stop at nothing to make their dream real... Gina Gershon( america's favorite 'almost lesbian' ) has a nice role here as a cutthroat. this is simply a guilty pleasure movie; enjoy it for what it is: a nice display of t and a"
2,THE Funniest movie I have EVER seen!,"Showgirls is the most entertaining, (un-intentionally) funny movie I have ever seen. From beggining to end, it is filled with cheesy scenes, bad acting, and hilarious dialouge that will have you rolling on the floor!""Showgirls"" tries to be sexy, but completely fails. The film is crap, thats why I only gave it two stars,one because it has good production values, and the other just because it honestly isn't worth just one star. But it get five out of five in being entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny!"
1,THIS IS SO BAD.,"SHOWGIRLS is so bad, I've watched it 4 times (including paying to see it opening weekend in 1994) just to see if it gets better. It doesn't, Liz Berkley and the VIP Room lap dance sequence aside. Only Gina Gershon has the right idea here: camp it up, cash your check and move on to star in BOUND (1995). Atleast the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace look great."
5,Show Girls,It was a great movie with a great price. I was extremely satisfied with the fast service and delivery. I would highly recommend the movie and the service given by Amazon.Showgirls (Fully Exposed Edition)
3,Treat yourself don't cheat yourself,"You should absolutely buy this DVD. It is cheap, and don't forget Gina Gershon gives the performance of a lifetime. This probably has the worst acting ever in it. I mean Nomi Malone, wow, she is a bad actress. But did we mention Gina Gershon is in it. So is the guy from Twin Peaks."
2,WATCH IT JUST FOR THE NEVER-ENDING AMOUNT OF NUDITY,"A GIRL HITCHES A RIDE TO LAS VEGAS WITH THE HOPES OF BECOMING A PERFORMER. VERY DUMB MOVIE. IT'S BASICALLY A BUNCH OF SOFTCORE PORN MIXED WITH A BACKSTAGE DRAMA. GETS 2 STARS ONLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE NUDITY THAT THIS FILM HAS. IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS MOVIE FOR MORE THAN JUST THE NUDITY, SOMETHING'S SERIOUSLY WRONG. LORD, IF THIS MOVIE DIDN'T HAVE THE AMOUNT OF NUDITY THAT IT HAD, THIS MOVIE BE TEN TIMES WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS. THE LESBIAN KISS AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE IS A BIG PLUS. 61 SECONDS OF FOOTAGE WAS CUT FOR AN R-RATED VERSION."
3,Not the worst movie in the world,"After getting this movie more or less accidentally, I decided I mind as well watch it.. see what the hype (or lack thereof) is about.Overall, this movie isn't that great. The acting is actually quite average.. nothing special, but certainly not horrible.. this was probably the thing that surprised me most... I was expecting acting on par with a (bad) porno.Somehow, they managed to make the nudity (and there's a good bit of it in the movie) completely nonsexual .. even the scenes where there's actual sex going on. How they did this, I have no idea.I could concievably imagine a story similar to this happening in the real world, which is the other thing about the movie thatsurprised me. I expected it to have the believeability of a badly written 1950's science fiction movie. So, this was a nice surprise.If they'd used decent actors, and even if everything else had stayed the same, they may've actually had a good movie to show for it."
3,Great for the price,"I got this movie for under a dollar and the DVD itself was in great condition. The movie is not a great movie, but I knew that before I bought it so it wasn't any surprise to me."
3,"Mediocre story, beautiful women","To me, this basically seemed like a film contrived to showcase a nude Elizabeth Berkley to sell tickets and DVDs. I guess it worked with me, as I could not resist seeing the class president from Saved By The Bell in her birthday suit. There was some plot beyond that, but I think that, for men at least, the only real memories of this will be the showgirls. To be fair, that is the title of it, and that is what it is about."
5,Showgirls...Schmowgirls!!,"I first saw this film at the Theatre about 14 years ago. It has lost none of its ""appeal"" over time. Kyle Maclaghlin gives a particularly ""wooden"" performance, following his success in ""Twin Peaks""!! ... and before ""Desperate Housewives""??!!"
4,Let's Go Camping !,"I have loved the movie Showgirls since the first time I watched it! Although the director didn't intend it to be, this movie is so CAMPY. It's fun, sexual, musical, fast moving and visually stunning. I don't take this movie seriously - that the characters and story should be realistic or politically correct. I think they are realistic enough for Las Vegas.This movie may not be suitable for Aunt Matilda or for children but for adults - set up the home theatre surround system, get a drink, sit back and be prepared for a fun ride.This particular box set is okay with the additional items (shot glasses, cards etc.) but not mandatory as just the film itself is all you need.Have fun!"
5,Guilty Pleasure,This film has the worst acting ever. That's probably what makes it so entertaining to watch. The costumes and the dancing are very entertaining and the plot is pretty ridiculous. The VIP set is great with the shot glasses. Definitely a movie you need to see at least once.
2,IF THERE WERE ONLY MORE OF GINA!,"This movie is a hoot!GINA GERSHON is THE only redeeming virtue in this film.SHOWGIRLS, is the first movie that I had ever seen GINA perform in,and I fell in live with her at first glance.The acting,other than GINA, who is playing her role totally tongue-in- cheek is terrible.The script is BAD!PLEASE HOLLYWOOD GIVE GINA A DECENT SCRIPT!"
3,Um...,"Hey, ""viewer from USA"", if you burned your DVD after the first 30 minutes, then how exactly did you know about the ""demented/crazy rape scene"" at the END of the movie? That's weird..."
2,This interview says it all:,"TW: How would you compare [working on Blue Velvet] to say, Showgirls?Kyle Machlachlan: That was pretty embarrassing."
3,Even better with blu ray,"Blu ray is the only way to watch movies, especially the older ones. Take Casablanca, The sound is spectacular but the viewing of the movie is even better, you can just about count the hairs on Bogart's head. As far as this movie, ""Showgirls"" I don't watch if for the girls I watch it for the brilliant photography. Give blu ray a thought, i wish they would make more of the older great movies in Blue ray."
3,THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!,"IS THIS MOVIE AWARD WORTHY? NO. IS THIS MOVIE ENTERTAINING? YES. IS ELIZABETH BERKLEY A GOOD ACTRESS? GOOD ENOUGH. FROM THE DIRECTOR OF ""BASIC INSTINCT"" AND ""HOLLOW MAN"". ""SHOWGIRLS"" WAS MADE TO ENTERTAIN, AND IT DOES JUST THAT. ANYTHING ELSE IS IRRELEVANT."
1,Complete Waste Of Money!,I knew what I was getting when I bought this movie. What I Didn't know was the the picture quality of this blu-ray disc is horrific. It came packaged with a blu-ray disc and a dvd. The dvd's quality is actually much better than the blu-ray. The blu-ray is fuzzy and grainy at best. This was an absolute waste of money. Totally disappointed! Very poor job of transferring to blu-ray.
1,WARNING! Can't Remove Subtitles! :(,"Just bought Showgirls off Amazon.com. This is obviously a foreign dvd.. It's written in both English and Chinese.. The movie itself plays great. Only problem is you can't remove the subtitles. As crazy as it sounds.. It's true! The dvd automatically started playing with the subtitles already on. I tried to turn them off. I clicked on subtitles and the only options it gives is English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.. There is no option to turn the subtitles off! My best advice for anyone wanting to buy this dvd is don't waste your money and go with buying the original version from another seller.. Probably not Amazons fault in all this. The manufacture is to blame.. The movie itself deserves 5 stars. But, I gave it one because of it being defective!:P Hopefully Amazon will get this problem resolved.. :("
3,Works Only As Camp...But What Great Camp,"Like ""Mommie Dearest,"" ""Valley of the Dolls,"" and so many others, taking ""Showgirls"" seriously will disgust and shock you - but watching it as a camp classic will bring howls of laughter. The DVD, with commentary from the Director, Stars, and Writer is a bonus because these guys take this film as a serious piece of art ! Reviewing this film is a waste of time - the writing, directing, acting, dancing - it is wretched. Elizabeth Berkley just is'nt showgirl material - she looks and talks more like a hooker than anything but Gina Gershon pulls off her part fairly well. Kyle MacLaughlin is simply ridiculous and his sex scene with Berkley is the biggest laugh-riot of the film and poor William Shockley as the ""hunky"" Singer Andrew Carver looks like a shaggier, sleazier version of Michael Bolton."
3,Free DVD when you buy these party supplies!,"i seen the film before and didn't think it was worth buying, but then i read about how this set is pretty much designed for getting drunk, so i figured there must be an entirely other dimension to the movie that is only apparent when intoxicated. Isn't that kinda sad? Its as if the studio felt bad for you for buying the dvd, so they figured they'd help you get drunk in return with the shot glasses and drinking games.Its worth it just for the party supplies. People will see your ""Showgirls"" shot glasses and you can say ""Yeah. I actually own those."""
1,Disappointement .....,Extremely disappointed. Exact the same movie no deleted scenes or any additional scenes. However there are scenes which exists and were not included in the movie. No comments from actors no interviews ..... I don't even know why it was called fully exposed version.
5,showgirls fully exposed edition,EB is great in the movie.she came a long way since her days in SAVE BY THE BELL.SHOWGIRLS IS THE HOTTEST MOVIE
5,Hot bodies,Although the movie was campie it was full of some of the hottest bodies on the planet. Especially the one who is taking off her top to dance right before the lap dance scene. Great movie.
4,legs'n breasts,"Though I was somewhat prejudiced against it, it did not bore me or make me hate Verhoeven. This film does not have any more depth than the shows it's based on; but it also does not ""pretend to"" have that. The difference of attitude between Robocop and Starship Troopers proves that Verhoeven can both make the ""real"" thing and a ""good"" parody of the real thing. Showgirls is closer to a parody of what you'd expect to see from an acclaimed director, but I gave it 4 stars for the sake of its sincereness and the abundance and quality of eroticism it depends on. If I watch it again, it won't be because I liked the story - I liked the ""girls"" and the ""show""s. In short, this is ""showgirls"" all over. Direct, strong, sexy, cheap..."
2,Lots of girls showing...,"It's an eye opener, reading the reviews, that the kitzhiness of a movie can also be good. A cheesy story, actors who cannot act - I have to admit that watching this movie I felt like I was transported to another planet. A fascinating experience in its own way. Some of the nude scenes are arousing. This movie plays best when you have the mute button on. I'd pick Basic Instinct over this one any day because there the story line is better even if chaotic."
3,Trash,"Trashy flick about Las Vegas Showgirls (DUH!), but a great place to see Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon in all their glory. Both ladies make a great effort to get something out of the script and characters (with Gerson winning hands down) but in the end the film is empty and void of any characters you would ever like in real life."
5,Good movie,"Showgirls is really good. Don't watch it thinking about what you have read about it, go into it with an open mind. The dvd includes the making of. Showgirls is not a comedy. If you buy this get the NC-17 version.I ordered the dvd, and am waiting for it to get here. I mailed the check yesterday. I have already seen the film, though."
4,hey hey hey what is going on here?,"first of all laugh all you want but i actually thought that this movie wasn't all that bad.i do think that gina gershon played her part really well.i also think she could have played elizabeth berkley's role too.i thought the movie was way better than striptease.i've seen both the r-rated and nc-17 versions and i saw no difference.i also didn't see much reason to rate it nc-17 either.the funny thing was i was sitting there thinking to myself,you know mr.belding and screach got to work with liz all through her teen years and they probally saw this movie.hell they probally own it!!!!-jason zabka"
1,This is a piece of crap,"If there was a negative rating, I would have picked that. All who were a part of this disaster should be whipped or something. Im sorry I bought it and feel sorry for those who actually liked it"
5,I like this movie alot,A very good movie I enjoyed it alot every time I watch it and that has been more than four time so far
2,TRASHY,Over hyped! Not even good photography. Would not recommend it. Don't waste your money. Try to find some other film.
4,Awesome skin flick,"I finally rented it after hearing all the negative [stuff] about it. Just goes to show you need to see a movie and judge it for YOURSELF! I enjoyed it beyond any expectations. I have now purchased it for my DVD collection. Elizabeth Berkley is hot (except her rear view wasn't all that great...) but Gina... YUMMY. The very ending was a bit easy, but comical. I loved the movie."
3,"underrated film is not that bad, actually, its almost good","what do people find about this movie that is so bad. I liked it. it's not the best movie ever made, but it is fun to watch and the performances are not that bad. The only reason thsi movie got three stars insted of four, actually, i give it three and a half, was because of the truly lousy ending. That was the only flaw in an otherwise good, visually dazzling film. I liked it."
1,"Showgirls, A.K.A. How to kill your career in one easy step!","My dad gave me this DVD when he couldn't make it through the first 15 minutes of it. I have to commend him on making it that far. I've tried to watch it three times now, and ten minutes is the most I can take. Sure, it's full of very attractive and very naked actresses, but it's also full of some of the most reprehensible acting and dialogue I've ever seen. It's truly painful to watch. The whole (short) time I spent watching this, I kept asking myself of everyone involved, ""What were they thinking?"""
1,Yeeesh!,"I had the misfortune of stumbling across the last 45 mins. of this (bowdlerized) flick on TV a few nights ago. I had hoped to stumble upon a redeeming quality, but I never did. This movie can best be described as high-gloss, highly-produced, heavily-veiled porn that passes itself off as mainstream entertainment. It's a great movie if you're into exotic dancing and topless girls, but if not, you're better off moving onto something else.I cringed at each sight of Elizabeth Berkley's straggly, curly mop hair and too-big lips."
1,GARBAGE,"This movie is not pulp, camp or even a wildly over-the-top mess - it is simply a revolting and mean-spirited porn film with the backing of a few Hollywood heavyweights. The grotesque violence and human wasteland depicted here never begin to be titillating; instead, they turn your stomach. This might be the most repugnant movie ever made because it portends to carry a message, and fakes redemption. Don't be fooled. This movie, which doesn't only hate women and brutalize virtually anything sexual, is like angry bile, and if you get too close you will get sick."
5,For the money; a nicely priced skin flick,"Well, to be quite honest, this is the greatest NC-17 rated movie I have ever seen. For the $$$, buy it, it is worth owning."
3,"Technically impressive, but not very enlightening","From a technical standpoint, this movie is quite impressive -- great photography, great choreography, great sound, and gorgeous women. But as far as being an accurate portrayal of what a showgirls life is really like, I feel its a failure. It gave me the feeling it was written by an avid fan of this sort of entertainment, who was relying solely on imagination and conjecture. I realize Im on shaky ground here, being no expert myself on what happens behind the scenes of the adult entertainment business. It just seemed like every twist and turn the plot took, including the brutal rape sequence, left me feeling like I could have imagined it myself. There wasnt one detail that made me feel the least bit enlightened. Overall, this movie ends up being not much more than another piece of adult entertainment itself, albeit an impressive one."
1,Poor Quality DVD,"These DVDs are absolutely rip offs. M-1 had some great fights, however you only see the action that was on broadcast TV. Each of these only come with 5 fights and many cut out rounds 1 and 2. The DVD's only hold about 50 minutes of action. I am a big time MMA Fan and these DVDs are just not worth it. HDNET should have bundled the fights together and made compilation DVDs"
4,Funny,Used it for our ladies golf league fun night. Was fun and brought many laughs. Light-hearted movie. Makes you laugh at golf.
5,Great version of the musical!,"I'm so happy that they're making these CDs again. There was a time when you couldn't find this version of Martin Guerre ANYWHERE! I got mine off of ebay, but I can assure that this is a beautiful CD! If you're familiar with the 1999 version, it's very similar, but the lyrics are different and the storyline was a bit different.I prefer Stephen Weller and Matt Cammelle (1999) to Iain Glenn and Matt Rawle (this version), but all in all the whole cast is fantastic. Jerome Pradon is at his best here, a truly marvelous performance as Guillaume. He's reason enough to buy the CD. (his ""I will make you proud"" is SOO much better than ""Justice will be done"")Get this CD! It's beautiful orchestrations and smart lyrics make it a must have for any Boublil/Schönberg fan."
4,perfect for extra practice,"I home school my son and these hot dots are a nice addition to our box of activities. They allow him to have a break and reinforce skills in a fun, independent way."
2,Great steering wheel breaks in less than three months,"First let me preface this: The Thrustmaster Steering wheel has some excellent features: Adjustable steering sensitivity, button setup, and nice throttle sensitivity make it a very nice playing wheel. I've had a great time with it, until a week ago.I had some worries about the controller from the beginning, as it made some ominous creaking noises out of the box. These concerns were confirmed last week when something snapped in the wheel during Rallisport Challenge. This has caused a steady increase in slackness in the wheel, resulting in a deadspot that makes the wheel unusable. Bummer.Let me add, this is my first bad experience with a peripheral, I've never broken anything else in the past, including other third party wheels (Logitech<PS2> and Mad Catz <DC> are two other steering wheel peripherals used extensively). Purchase at your own risk..."
1,This is by Thrustmaster!?,Totally disappointing. The dead space is unbelievably large and the 8-directional button keeps misinterpreting input strokes. Can't believe this junk has the Thrustmaster name on it. The wheel is cheap plastic construction and has a very flimsy feeling. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
1,The Steering wheel sucks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The steering wheel is offline, it sticks and goes to one direction. Also the bottons on the steering wheel are all backwords. The is the worst steering wheel I have ever used."
2,"Arcade OK, but simply not up to standards for simulations!","Here we go!! just got myself a XBox, F1 2002, and this steering wheel...My conclusion is simple and dreadfull... it's just doesn't give me accurate control over my car!! The deadspot in the center is just to big, and the forcefeedback get's a 2 out of 10. The experience with my PC and wheel is better!! and thats not the reason for me to run to the shop...But ok, as an objective reviewer i can give it 2 stars as it is useable in arcade like games."
4,Not a good choice,"The only good thing I can say about this wheel, is that it worked as soon as I plugged it in with no set up or configuration (other than the table clamp)I tried several games with this wheel.. Apex, Gotham Racing, Need for Speed, RalliSport.. and in all the games, the results were the same.Firstly, the wheel is too small, it needs to be a little bit bigger. Second, there is alot of play in the wheel, for racing, you want the wheel to be responsive to small movements. This is not the case. Third, the button positions could be much better, they are difficult to reach while trying to drive.I would not suggest getting this wheel, it just doesn't do racing justice"
2,Wheel Woes,"This is a decent steering wheel if you want a basic arcade-style experience. For those who are a bit pickier about the driving, the wheel has a large ""dead-spot"" in the middle of the steering range which makes precise steering adjustments next-to-impossible.Some positive notes are the programmable features and the Microsoft-style cable break-aways (which allows controller extension cables to be used)"
5,hard to believe,"I knew Grace was a bad company, but did not know how bad the medical community handled this problem. Hard to believe they followed their healing oath."
3,Partially a good resource but flawed,"The vital records collected and available in this book are very useful but the genealogy of the families is quite flawed. A researcher would want to verify each bit of information. My own families (Browns, Prestons, Van Hooses, Williams, etc) are in this book and the mistakes are numerous."
3,not as good as the old ones,These containers aren't bad. BUt they are not as good as past tupperware storage containers. These tend to let a little moisture in. I find my sugar and brown sugar get lumpy. I never had that with my old set. But that set was about 29 years old. They don't make things like they used to.
4,easy to identify whats in there,"the reason i did not give this a 5 is because out of 5 sets i bought there were 4 lids that don't fit tight but got replacement. watch out though, if you go through TUPPERWARE they want to charge you $6 for shipping to replace and you have to pay to ship to them! BUY FROM ""Virtual Hot Deals"" they will take care of you if there is a problem!!!"
5,Love these!,"The tupperware canisters were exactly what I was looking for to replace my old ones. There is LOTS of room in them and I can even put an entire 5lb bag of flour into the big one! My old ones were never big enough to do that! I love how they close and the ""peak thru"" windows at the bottom are great! I didn't really think I would use them, but I find myself noticing if they are getting empty and remembering to get refills at the store! Love them!"
2,tops stink,"Was hoping for tried and true Tupperware here, remembering the Tupperware of my youth. These stink. They are very hard to work with and I do not like the push tops at all. Wish I hadn't spent the $. Great seller, bad product."
4,Canister Set,I wanted a Tupperware canister set because I had one before and liked it. The covers on the canister are little hard to put on and off but I imagine that comes easier with use. I believe the price was right and it came on time.
4,Very pleased with this purchase,"I am very pleased with the quality of these canisters. The lids lock on air tight with just a push to the center. I chose red, however it would have been nice to get color that would match my decor or something in a nuetral shade."
3,Russian Grammar,"This book is definitly not for beginners. I'm sure in time I will be able to use it and it seems to be very comprehensive, but not a good book to start with when there is still the need to learn the basics like reading cyrillic and being able to pronounce the words correctly. Should not be listed as a beginner book at all especially with the cost of it, a hard way to learn that I can't use this book for quite a while."
3,It'll get you through most of your basic needs,"I always have my eyes open for good reference books.I took four semesters of Russian in a two-year college program, over ten years ago. I still have problems tackling even the basics of the this language's complex verbal system.This is just what I needed -- a schematic look at the grammar of the Russian language. Its has a detailed index and a comprehensive scope; quick answers can be found easily to anyone who understands the basics of this language.This is the best guide I've found so far, and I still haven't found anything else to replace it. Please remember, this is not a text book, it is a well-made reference guide to the Russian language."
5,Perfect,"Truly comprehensive; I bought this to continue my grammar studies after returning from a two month intensive Russian program in Kazan' through the State Department. Wade seems to focus a bit more on the (sometimes) many exceptions for each grammar construction, but overall this is an amazing book. Organized from beginner grammar to advanced, I highly recommend for anyone seeking to learn the ins and outs of Russian grammar. Whether new to the language or multi-year veteran, you will learn."
2,Not his best,"As a longtime fan of Gore Vidal I was disappointed in this latest work of his. I have read most of his work in recent times and have even given his books as gifts to friends, but this latest effort is not up to Vidal's usual high standard. The literary essays are fine and in several instances wonderful. However in the political essays there was a sameness about them collectively that seemed to render them shrill and unreadable. It is not the content that I object to, merely the repetition. There is only on essay on politics in this volume and Vidal has repackaged it several times, reheating and serving it up again and again."
2,"mostly illogical, but intellegent","Gore Vidal, clearly one of the great essayists of our time, a wonderful man to read. He speaks to the best iun us and one must be educated to fully comprehend his literary indulgences. Unfortunatly for all his grandeur this publication is mostly flawed. its essays ont he Japanese intentions in WWII, its view of Islam and his biased, illogical hateed of the Republicans and his view of Americas role in the world are all flawed.Nevertheless I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a fair and intellegent critique of the conservative agenda. Most of illogical trash that documents Americas sopposed obessesion with dominating the world is not worth the reading. Pick up Gore's book but I would recommend bringing along some other sources so you can better be academically equipped to rebut Mr. Gores comments."
1,Really bad quality,I got this cd and its really bad quality music. Its like someone recorded tape himself and then made it even worse. This really is not worth this money. Its junk
1,Very poor quality! Listen carefully to the previews.,"I listened to the previews for this album and thought it was just a fluke of the ""preview"" mode. It's not.The audio quality is very poor and choppy, like most of the songs are created with audio samples from a couple tunes.This is clear if you listen to all the previews, but I went ahead and bought the album anyway. My mistake.If you like ""Amazing Grace,"" it's actually quite well done here, and if my hypothesis about sampling is true, it may be the one tune that gave rise to the others. Go ahead and spend that 99 cents, but don't buy the album.I suppose these might be OK as ring tones, but they're not quality pipe music to bring in the haggis!"
3,Disappoints,"This is an undoubtedly solid game. However, it suffers severely from plain looking graphics, and the play control is a bit gawky at times. Probably the worst bit is that the main baddies are unbelievably tough to kill, so I'm not even past the first chapter. Overall it gets dull and eventually you just give up on it. It had great potential, I love how it would tell a story, but it needs better design."
4,Could be better balanced,"You get too many of the air filters for the number of oil filters you get. Nice to have them in a package and all, but if you end up with leftovers it's not so helpful. Maybe if there's a package of just oil filters you could keep the proportions right over several purchases."
3,*,"Just received my new deep fryer recently, and ordered the replacement filters at the same time. I have only used the fryer 3-4 times. The filters don't keep the odor down as much as I expected."
4,Good Filters,"If you have a fryer, you'll need these filters. Eliminates some odor, smoke and grease. But there will be some residues."
4,pleased with this purchase,The best way to find filters and you do not have to drive around looking for them. Very pleased with the order and rec'd items in a timely manner.
4,Raging hardcore!,"WHN is leading the pack of the 80s positive hardcore revival bands. What started out as sort of a joke/tribute band has blossomed into a serious and powerful musical force. WHN features members of several bay area bands (Spazz, F--kface, All You Can Eat, Your Mother, Artimus Pyle, Plutocracy, etc) which is probably what helped them get a leg up in the begining. This is their first official full-length following several other releases (3 or 4 7''s, a few compilations, a 10'' and a CD that compiles everything before Standfast. Anyway, if you like your hardcore fast, loud and with intelligently written lyrics, WHN is for you. The video footage included on the CD is also very entertaining."
2,cheap planter,"I have been looking for planters like some I already own and have not been successful. I thought I found the right planter, but it is not what I expected. What I got was a cheap flimsy pot. I would not get this again."
4,Nice flower pot,We received them fairly quickly and they are a nice bright red. A little scuffed here and there so that's why its only 4 stars but otherwise its a nice pot and works well for our needs.
3,Ehh...,"I expected the plastic to be a bit more solid. Once I filled it with soil and planted my ivy, the bottom bends and wobbles a bit when I picked it up. Nonetheless, once in place it serves it purpose well and looks nice."
3,Not bad.,"If you want a very light-weight planter ,then this is ideal. You may however find it wobbly to move around."
2,Not as advertised. Cheap product.,"This planter is not high gloss, but the typical cheap planter available at any discount store. The planters I got were a dull red finish, cheaply molded plastic with scratches, scrapes and excess plastic at seams."
4,What can I say,It's a plastic planter. It works. Buy it if you need a planter and don't want to spend much. Simple
5,As advertised.,"I like the way it holds dirt. It looks good, and is of good quality. I would order this again."
3,Color way off!,I ordered quasar blue and it does not look anything like the color in the picture! The color I received is more like a teal. Disappointed! The pot itself will work. It isn't very thick. Too bad they don't sell what I was looking for walmart.
1,Scratched & scuffed in many places!,"Item arrived scratched and scuffed in many places all along the outside! This is junk -- soft, scratched-up plastic. I can't put my nice plant in this and expect it to look decent! Has this been abused in a Dollar store, then consigned to be sold here? This is junk. Waste of time & money RMA."
3,"""Acid"" Green","It's not a bad planter for what we need, but we were disappointed that the Acid Green wasn't the vibrant neon shown in the picture. It's more of an avocado green."
5,Beautiful,"I only was able to look at this book at a bookstore (I couldn't afford it), but it was one of the most beautiful books I've ever seen. The black and white photographs illustrate women of all races and ages, with one thing in common- they love other women. I'm sure each story is very amazing, but I didn't get the chance to read them (they discourage reading whole books in bookstores ;) ) If you have the money, I definately recommend it. It is absolutely beautiful."
4,Reasonably priced and do the job,"I recently had a set of these door visors installedon my 2009 Honda Element EX. These are installed by way of adhesive; I'll see how well they stand up to a Canadian winter. Fit and finish are good! And these have already paid themselves back after we forgot to fully close a window overnight. It rained but with these visors installed, no water entered the vehicle."
4,This Movie Sure Has Class!,"Class Of Nuke Em' High Part II is a bad movie. But it's so bad that it's good. There's always something crazy going on, so it's impossible to be bored by it. However, it's too dumb to be great trash so it's just good trash. There's lots of nudity, gore, and slimy special effects in this sequel. Also, the theme song rocks! See it if you love Troma...of course."
2,Okay,"""Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2"" was an okay film, but not a great one. The original was better. When I ordered this, I thought 'Alright, I finally get to see Tromie, the Nuclear Squirrel.' I thought he'd show up at the end, but the makers of this film had to ruin it by showing the end of the film at the beginning. That's why I didn't much care for this one. Also, I didn't like the theme song. All they said was ""Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2"" over and over again. But I'm glad I only had to pay 5.99 for this movie and not 13.99."
2,crap,"Bad acting scantily clad women,gross special effects,and a totally off the wall plot are all parts of this tongue in cheek flick from the wackos at Troma Inc.Remember, its supposed to be this bad."
5,very pleased,This product is great my daughter was thrilled and has been enjoying it! It is exactly what was expected! It was made of solid material and very durable.
1,Cheap..don't buy,"This product is made of cheap plastic and is not worth the money. I bought two of these guns for my little girls at Tweetsie Railroad. Although they are pretty, they were not good for much else. The paper caps kept getting jammed in the gun and the trigger was very hard for my daughters ages 4 and 5 to pull. After firing the guns a few times, the seam began to split. Luckily, the store let us return the guns and exchange them for something else. We bought the ""Bill The Kid"" gun which was much better."
4,Pretty Good Dictionary For Learners,"This is my first dictionary for learning Irish, and so far it's been pretty good. It is fairly complete in terms of entries, and often has examples of how words are used. It doesn't have pronunciations, which is a bummer on the Irish side but, in some ways, even more so on the English side because when I want to look up the Irish word for ""live"", for example, so I can talk about where I live, there is also an entry for ""live"" as in live music. So I have to go back and forth a bit. But overall I like this dictionary."
5,A must for every kitchen,"This was the best ""investment"" I've made in the kitchen. If you love to cook, you MUST have this roasting pan. I use if for everything; chicken, roastbeef, prime rib, turkeys, pot roasts. It has never let me down. Everything turns out to perfection. You will not be disappointed. After going through several cheap roasting pans, I splurged for the ultimate. It's worth every penny."
2,Overpriced,This pan fails to deliver. This pan is the black sheep of the All Clad line. It is made of solid stainless steel and is not an aluminum triply pan as it is advertised. It is also made in Korea unlike the other All Clad products which are made in the USA. Shop around there are better products out there for half the price.
5,Clarification,"As many reviewers have said, this is an excellent roasting pan/rack combo.Just to clarify the above information, this pan is NOT made of stainless-aluminum-stainless ""sandwich"" construction. It is entirely stainless steel (albeit very heavy duty and very high quality). The rack is not as high quality, and I have seen them break at the welds. (Note also that there seem to be two varieties of rack, those with handles on the ""short"" sides and those with handles on the ""long"" sides. The latter seems to be the newer variety and more sturdy than the former..."
3,One heckuva CD,"HELP YOURSELF is one heckuva CD. ""Get A Life"" and the songs on tracks 6 through 12 comprise the meat of the work. Julian Lennon has been criticized for sounding like his father John Lennon. Well, tough toenails, because you can sound like John Lennon or anybody else and still create enjoyable music, which Julian does on HELP YOURSELF."
2,Critical,"I know people might say I'm too critical of Julian and not giving himcredit where credit is due. I also will note that Julian is not John in any way. I always believed Julian was much better than he sounds or I should say, makes himself sound anyway. I believe there is John inside Julian somewhere, but we have yet to see that in his lyrics. I don't think the lyrics are that good honestly, and the sound is more like a 1980's retro alternative than modern day. I suppose what I'm disappointed with, is missing the sound that John developed over his life and I wish Julian would transition back to some of that. I also wish Julian would perform more of his father's music, to grab onto that feeling. Or perhaps I just miss John as most of us do. But I still think Julian can do much better than he has."
3,Nothing Really Wrong With It Per Say But&#65533;.,"This album is pretty bland inoffensive stuff, similar to THE SECRET VALUE OF DAYDREAMING. It's not exactly bad, but it's not exactly good either, in fact it's not much of anything except fluff. It's especially disappointing considering the promise he showed with Mr JORDAN. It does make one wonder, would Julian have ever got a deal without his famous name? I doubt it. Look for more mediocre artists with famous names to come (anyone remember Wilson Phillips?)"
4,A great deal in a small package!,"I used the 2000 edition of this book as I traveled around Europe. It was not always 100% accurate in its pronunciation guidelines, but it was close enough frequently enough to still be worthwhile. I found it helpful in 9 or 10 different countries, and it was nice to have one (compact) book for so many places. Based on my experience with this book I'm planning to get the South-East Asian 9 language phrasebook for my upcoming trip to that area."
4,An accurate description of life along the upper river.,"Madson's book is a refreshingly accurate and honest disclosure of the lives of those who have made their lives along the banks of the upper Mississippi. He takes the time to get to know those people and then he welcomes the reader into their homes, stores, and living rooms. Reminiscent of a Steinbeck, ""Travels With Charlie"", the reader is charmed into the history and personality of the river towns and their people from Beaver Island to Harper's Ferry. Madson's understanding of the river and his ability to share it with all readers, regardless of their previous Mississippi River experience, is a tribute to ""River Rats"" everywhere. This book is a Terry Redlin in text form."
1,"Incredibly dated, not at all romantic.","I'm a huge Nora Roberts fan, but this is the worst romance novel I have ever read, and that is saying a lot. This is the kind of romance novel that gives romance novels a bad name (minus the bodice ripping and sex- this one has no sex. At all.) Originally published in 1984, but republished in 2003, Sullivan's Woman features a moody jerk of an artist and a completely innocent dreamer of a writer. Of course she's stunningly beautiful, so he must paint her. Over the two months of their sitting she manages to fall completely in love with him, but heck if I can figure out why. So far as I can tell, they didn't actually talk and he just yells at her a lot. In the very final chapter we find out that he can't live without her and they live happily ever after. What? Huh? This is exactly the stereotype of a romance that makes everyone think they are all crap. Spoiler: They aren't all crap."
2,One of my least favorite Nora books......,"Cassidy St. John is out of work and is thrilled by artist Colin Sullivan's offer to pay her for modeling for a portrait. He treats her terribly throughout the whole book and then wants to marry her in the end, because he is haunted by her face. I doubt anyone would fall for such an abusive, domineering man in real life.Excerpt from the back of the book:""Fired from yet another job, Cassidy St. John hardly expected the solution to her difficulties to come looming out of the fog on Fisherman's Wharf. However, the darkly handsome Colin Sullivan seemed the answer to any maiden's prayers.When Colin offered Cassidy a job modeling for one of his paintings, it seemed her troubles were over- but one look at his blue eyes and Cassidy knew they were just beginning. How could she hide from the pitiless honesty of Colin's artistic vision when with every stroke of his brush he exposed her love for him?"""
2,It's a reissued story by Roberts,"Written in the early 1980s, I would guess that Roberts was just getting her feet wet in the land of romance writing. But spend your money on her later stuff instead, I wish I had. (And I love a lot of her work.)"
2,Story? What story?,"I gave the book two stars because I did actually finish the book but that says more about my desperation for something to read than the ""interest holding power"" of this Nora ""Light"" book. Definitely an early work, it is the first time I found absolutely nothing to like about her hero. And how can you like a heroine who would fall in love with someone who does nothing but snap, snarl, and bite at her?"
1,A waste of time,"Set in San Francisco, Cassidy St. John is a writer working minimum wage jobs (and writing her second book) while waiting for her first manuscript to be accepted somewhere. Since she's between jobs, she agrees to model for world-renowned artist Colin Sullivan. Colin was born in Ireland and has lived in the U.S. since he made it big fifteen years ago. They fall in love.I pretty much didn't like anything about this story, especially how dated it is. Cassidy says no and he ignores her? He shakes her, manhandles her, grabs her by the hair? Maybe that was cool in the 80's (not in MY world, it wasn't) but why reissue this mess? Why? This book should NOT have been republished without a major updating."
1,Old and Tired,"This short story isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I only happended to buy it because of the Golden Gate Bridge on the cover. The book was very weak in plot development, character depth, scene descriptions, etc. Cassidy and Colin - the two romantic leads - could have been developed much more if the book was longer and the writing stronger. I think the publishers are just cashing in on something Roberts penned in high school - the writing is pretty bad. Save yourself the time and money and buy a more recent Roberts book."
3,Not the best of Dorf,"Our family is a fan of Tim Conway's Dorf. We enjoyed this movie, but not nearly as well as his others. This one has some great scenes, but they are countered with scenes that tend to repeat the same gag a bit too much. Some of the content seems to try too hard to be funny, and some just is not funny. We did not find the name calling and spouse fighting worth a repeat watch. If you desire a complete set of Dorf videos, you should add this to your collection. If you are out for one great Dorf video, this is not it."
1,Disappointed,This is absolutely the worst video I have ever watched. It is so bad that you might want to get it to see how bad a great comedian like Tim Conway can be.
4,Just about perfect,"This was so well crafted. You actually felt like you were in Victorian England (well with demons). The heroine is resourceful and loving. Adrian is smart yet not over bearing. He is not a super alpha male hero, but he shows such care and love. I love the fact that he makes difficult choices and is not apologetic about them. No quirky, zany characters or last minute saves from new people. This is a tightly drawn story you will soak in. The only real problem is it ends a little abruptly. I could have gone on for another 100 pages."
1,Couldn't finish it,"Emma Holly conveys a sexual freedom in her work that is addictive and luscious! This was not one of her better works. The sex became monotonous and extremely ""not-special"", the flip-flopping of the main character was pathetic ad-nauseum, there was no substantial action or secondary situations to hold interest and I found myself just not caring what happened..... because, Duh! You KNOW they will end up together with a baby in the end anyway.... so the ""how"" just didn't matter. This is the first time I have ever been able to let a book go without finishing it. I found Sherrilyn Kenyon's Born of Fire MUCH more interesting and satisfying."
1,Thinly guised soft porn,Just like the title says...thinly veiled soft porn under a very weak layer of fantasy. She should write for the skin magazines and not even be considered an author in the SF&F genre.
4,Very enjoyable,"I picked this book up because a friend of mine had read it, and told me about it. She described it as, ""Victorian, only not"", and I think that's a pretty apt, if short, description. Emma Holly gives us two main character who are flawed, but not in an irredeemable way. Holly also has a flair with showing us the internal conflicts her characters are going through. This book is definately adult in content, but the erotic content compliments the main story, instead of overwhelming it. A good read, and very much something to be read more than once."
3,Great with any LCD or PLASMA,Love the Media Lights behind my big plasma HD..Bring out a good mood to the living room when watching tv or movie.
5,Philosophy Book for Common People,"This is a philosophy book, but different from other philosophy books in many ways.First, this book is for common people and all people,not just for those who teach and study philosophy at college.You do not have to crack your brains to understandthe terms and expressions in this book.Instead, you can taste and smell a variety of lives,reading the dialogues, discussions and stories in this book.Second, this book is a drama.One day a successful journalist put an end to his job,and started a new life,taking a courageous step towrad a journey of planting philosophy across the country.He calls himself Appleseed of philosophy.Third, this book is a virus.The virus of passion for truth, story, the virus of childlike curiosity.This virus may infect readers, turning them into a voracious questioners.This virus may go beyond that andtransform readers into ¡gadflies¡, which may irritate the establishment or society."
2,cute book but thats it,"this book is very cute but does not have any real substance. the idea to travel around and discuss philosphy is beautifull but if you are looking to read a book that will help you venture deeper into philosphy, this is not it. the book has some nice, fluffy conversations. the main idea of the book could have been summed up in a page, which is ""ask more questions."" so if you are looking to read something in line of ""zen and art of motorcycle maint."" this is not it but if you are looking to read a easy to read, fluffy book about philosphy then go for it.Also, at times this book gets way to idealistic without any regards to true facts of life that human beings have to deal with. I mean, can a person with a family and kids travel around discussing philosphy without getting paid for it?can a person quit their job and go pursue their dreams[as the book suggests] without any regard to taking care of their families? way too idealistic at times!!!!"
4,I like it,"For a book about Socrates, it is very ""light"". It gives you a sense of what Socrates was about, what he did and how we can do it. In this book, you can see that you don't need to be an intellectual to understand Socrates, that every opinion counts in the search for truth."
1,Not worth the money,"Though this book may seem for the ""common people"", it is really a waste of money. I think Socrates would be embarrased to have his name on a book of a sophist."
1,Not Socrates Cafe.,The Socrates Cafe is a poorly written book. Christopher Phillips was to busy using fancy words to realize that the reader has to spend 15 seconds on words just to pronounce them correctly. I like his ideas but he came up short putting them into words! Using fancy language is not always a good thing. The best writing is writing that is clear and precise.
3,John Dewey's Cafe?,"It's hard not to admire the enthusiasm of Christopher Phillips in his efforts to revive interest in philosophy among a wide variety of contemporary persons. Questions arise, however, as to just how socratic his modus operandi is. He declares he's no self-help guru, for instance. Yet is his readiness to descend to tears and therapy rather than ironic tough-mindedness, this is exactly what he ultimately most resembles. His repeated disinclination to answer questions put by an interlocutor and his preference instead for returning the question to its asker strikes me as even more guru-like and unsocratic. Finally, his eagerness to avoid extended one-on-one question and answer encounters in the presence of a group, preferring rather the role of the ""facilitator"" who gets everyone talking, reveals him more as the unwitting heir of the flattering John Dewey than of the ""offensive"" Socrates who claimed to know nothing, but was able to show smug others that they knew even less."
5,attention all thinkers and seekers -- this book is for you,"Packed with brilliant philosophical meditations and soul-stirring wisdom, this book is a thinkers' and seekers' delight. ""Socrates Cafe"" is one of those rare finds that will still be talked about and explored centuries from now."
4,An Entertaining Read,"Socrates Cafe is an easy and entertaining read. Mr. Phillips fills the pages with a good overview of philosophy as we know it, intermixed with his experiences while establishing this ""cafes"" or discussion groups around the country.As an independent scholar, I wish there was more practical information on setting up and promoting a discussion group. This information is available on his website (...), but it would have been nice to have some information in the book.Nonetheless, it is an excellent overview of philosophy."
2,"Cheap media, poor compatibility and reliability","Radius Technology DVDs ID as ""OPTODISC"" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many ""coaster"" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata)."
1,Waste of money,"Burned 3 - All 3 had problems like freezes and skips. Total waste of money. As somebody else has said, get Ritek instead."
1,Do Not Buy,"I wasted money on four packs, every burn has failed. I used about ten before my burner went dead and stoped reading dvds all together, so I had to buy a new burner and they still don't work. You get what you pay for."
4,OK for my purposes,"I set out to design a decent floor plan and thats about it. Many people gave this software bad reviews but they failed to mention that this software is NOT a 3d rendering software as you would expect from Lightwave or 3ds max, but instead it is software for designing floor plans.As far as changing scale ALL home blueprints in the us are typically 1/4 : 1 so it's pointless to want to change it.With a little preplanning a slight knowledge of drafting, anyone should be able to use this software to design a house.Hint: If you need to add a component thats not available, print it out and add it yourself with a pencil and a ruler."
3,PSEUDO-NOIR THAT FAILS TO DELIVER,"Despite an intriguing set-up and attractive cast, this tepid wannabe film noir blows its potential with uneven pacing, idiotic plot twists, and a weak third act. The abrupt, out-of-left-field ending, replete with a half-hearted attempt at a dramatic payoff, only adds insult to injury. The supposedly black comedy that other reviewers mention seemed to have eluded me entirely. The rip-off wave between friends is set up nicely, but the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the self-consciously stylish cinematography didn't help in getting into them, just leaving a hollowly stylish exterior. A drab and ultimately forgettable film, not a bad way to kill an afternoon perhaps but surely not a keeper."
2,Waste of money,"This makes for a good late night HBO movie when you are bored. Not worth the money spent to own , nor the time spent watching it. IF it was 20 years ago I might have said it was a good movie , but nowadays its just too boring and obvious."
3,The Desire to Leave...,"In the town of xxx it seems like nothing ever changes and Nick desires to get out of xxx. When Nick's father dies he thinks he will be able to leave with the help of the inheritance that his father has left for him. However, on the way to the funeral Nick meets Lissa. Nick and Lissa become lovers and after some problems with the inheritance it seems like Nick cannot leave xxx. This in turn leads to some fishy business that snowballs and the story takes some interesting turns that build up a dynamic plot. Best Laid Plans is a contemporary film-noir that offers a suspenseful plot with intriguing sub plots. This leads the audience through a deceitful story that is built on a terrific script, which at the end seems to plunge due to some awkward moments in the film. Overall, this film provides a tolerable cinematic experience."
4,Very Interesting,"I expected this movie to be a teen movie,but it wasn't.I was surprised at how much I liked the movie .What helped was it made you care for the characters + plus it had nice plot twists. The plot does seem familiar though, seems like a mixture of other movies like Indecent Proposal,Requiem of a Dream plus some that I can't quite put my finger on.Anyway it's defenitely worth watching.Especially if you like Reese Witherspoon."
4,The Ending Will Shock You!,"I recently rented this movie, ""Best Laid Plans"" and fell in love with the fun loving relationship between the main character Nick played by Alessandro Nivola and his love interest on screen Reece Witherspoon. There on screen chemistry was GREAT! It kept me rooting for them during the entire movie. I wish there could have been more scenes between them.....but, I digress. When, I first started to watch this movie I thought I had the plot/storyline all figured out, but I was WRONG! The ending was a shock! Just for that reason alone it is worth renting and checking out for yourself."
3,"good movie, great ending","The plot was a little weak, but the ending was outstanding. I liked the cast. DVD picture is good but sound could be better."
3,"NO BIG DEAL, BUT IT WON'T HURT YOU ...","This film wished to be different and intriguing but it somehow fails along the way, even with good acting fom the main couple ( whitersppons and Alessandro ). The final conclusion is that it is a sometimes enjoyabole film, but, in general, bond to be forgotten soon after you watch it."
3,Big and clumsy,"If you have solved Sudoku puzzles before, this book just contains too many easy puzzles, the hard ones aren't that hard either. And on top of that it is huge! Not practical to bring with you and a bit clumsy to hold when you are solving the puzzles. I prefer his other books to this one."
4,Not too bad,"I agree it's a bit big, but on the other hand you get all the puzzles you'll ever need - maybe even a bit more than you need, but then you can do what we did and rip the puzzles out and split them between family members. I know, it's an awful thing to do to a book, but still... In summary, high quality puzzles, just like we've come to expect."
2,I've lived long enough to see electronic music sound dated!,This album may have been great sounding when it was first released but it now sounds very dated. Hasn't aged well.
3,good contemplative music,"Although the sounds on this cd are a bit dated, it is still a good cd for contemplation or to listn to as you fall asleep."
5,Gripping thriller!,"Jeff Deaver is a master of suprise twists and turns and will have you on the edge of the seat turning pages as quickly as possible to see what happens next. You will think you have it all figured out and then Mr. Deaver hits you upside the head with a doozy.The subject matter of deaf children as hostages was done very tactfully and well. I learned a lot about deaf culture and the courage and strength of the people in the culture.Characterization was done extremely well. I was able to get to know the characters and feel the passions, anger and anxiety that they felt.A thoroughly enjoyable read from the get go"
1,A ridiculous waste of paper!,"I was grievously disappointed with A MAIDEN'S GRAVE, especially after reading THE BONE COLLECTOR. Certain weak premises are unforgiveable - such as frequent the use of the word ""stoat"" by numerous characters, including the deaf ones and their interpreters, when a sign-language interpretation of that word would be automatically translated to ""weasel"". This is Kansas, not England! All the characters are poorly-defined and broadly unsympathetic, except the smallest children who are barely more than props shaken at the reader like helpless puppies. The ""suspense"" in this book left me feeling dirty and voyeuristic."
2,Not the Deaver I know and Love,"Having read Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer before I read this one...I expected more. I am happy that this was not my first Deaver novel, I may not have read anymore of his works!!The story was weak and slow."
1,Thoroughly Disappointing,"Vulgar, violent and tasteless. I regret wasting my time and money on this book. Jeffrey Deaver will not be included in my library."
5,Deaver never fails to deliver!,Another fantastic novel by Jeffery Deaver where you never know what's around the next corner. Always suspenseful and entertaining. I'm hooked!
4,Catching up with Jeffery Deaver's books,I have only just lately started reading Deaver's books so I have a lot of catching up to do. This one has thus far (I'm about 3/4 of the way through it) has been a great read. I find my self reading far longer before bed than I intended :-)
3,"Choppy, but has a good ending","This book feels like it's the awkward kid on the playground. It's a novel that should have been a script. Paced like a film, described like a film, dialogue like a film, it feels like A Maiden's Grave missed it's true calling.It's a great story, just not as a novel."
2,Not my kind of book.,"I know this book got a lot of good reviews, but I would give it 2Stars. I found that the hostage plot made the novel a chore to read. Perhaps my opinion is this way because I prefer a good murder mystery when the killer/s are completely unknown. Don't get me wrong, there was a twist at the end, but not a big one. A good novel for anyone interested in long hostage negotiations, otherwise try something else."
5,Mr. Deaver Delievers,"Another great book by Mr. Deaver. Even though it did not have Lincoln Rhyme it was still great fun to read. As with all of his books, there are always some twist and unexpected things and this book is no exception. Just when I thought I knew it all Mr. Deaver throws something at me to keep me off balance. A fun read but not up to The Bone Collector status. Enjoy!"
2,WARNING,"i thought the book was really good. there's only one problemwith it and that's the rape scene that was way to descriptive. i wishhe wouldn't have put that in, it spoils the book. it bothers me alot to read that kind of thing, because then i'll have that image in mind for some time. besides that i thought the book was one of his best. it had well written character, a good plot, and not a bunch of technical terms they spend pages explaining to you. BUT had i known about the rape i would not have read it."
4,I ALREADY REVIEWED THIS BOOK!,"I ALREADY REVIEWED THIS BOOK AND MY REVIEW HAD BEEN PUBLISHED BUT FOR SOME REASON IT DISAPPEARED LAST WEEK, PLEASE EXPLAIN!!!"
4,Great thriller,"A gripping thriller, ideal for a long train journey or flight. What makes it stand out is its compassionate and intelligent portrayal of the world of the Deaf (with a capital D). Any run-of-the-mill writer would have used deafness as a McGuffin without taking it any further. Deaver's sensitivity makes his book stand out from the rest of the pack."
4,good read,"Actually, I bought this on a whim. Some Deaver novels are better than others. This was quite good. Plot moved along well and kept me interested throughout the novel. Deaver provides ample twists and turns, so even when you think you have it all figured out, you probably don't!His character dialogue is very believeable and he gives his people ample flaws in character and their fears and indecisiveness make them real to us. I would certainly recommend this one."
5,Excellent thriller!,This has to be one of the best thrillers i have read; I finished reading it within 24 hours and then couldn't stop thinking about the characters. Even though I didn't find the 'love story' between Arthur Potter and Melanie to be at all credible this didn't spoil the story for me. Highly recommended if you're looking for a good page-turner that makes you think.
4,"Deaver Dithers, but WOW!","Deaver's love of excruciating detail has certainly exasperated many readers caught in his exciting stories: come ON!! Get on with the story!!!I am not going to spoil the ending of this novel for you (you're welcome). Simply allow me to say, the plot really picks up just when you think all the dust has settled.So find a comfortable chair for the long haul, and happy reading!PS: If you read at night, you will probably want to turn on ALL the lights."
3,Good police insight but doesn't pull the heart strings,"Eight young deaf girls and their teachers are abducted by three escaped convicts and held hostage in an abandoned slaughterhouse. Arthur Potter, senior hostage negotiator with the FBI, is called to the scene. He soon finds in Lou Handy, the convict in charge, a diabolical adversary. Deaver is at his best when describing police procedure in detail without complex jargon. Excellent juggling of multiple scenes and varied characters."
2,I had high hopes for this book - they were dashed,"I was excited to begin this book, as I had read ""The Bone Collector"" and loved it. After I got into ""A Maiden's Grave"" I found myself searching for any periodical to read to avoid finishing ""Grave"". Deaver does a great job with narrative, making you feel as if you were there. The problem was that the plot dragged on and on. I felt like shouting ""let's be done with this, already!"" There also seemed to be a sense of hopelessness that pervaded the storyline - that doesn't make for enjoyable reading."
5,His Best One!,"I thought I was a Deaver fan before this, having read Coffin Dancer and others, but A Maiden's Grave is definitely one of the best books I have read this year. The characterisation of Arthur Potter is excellent and the girls' strength during their ordeal will make you go from feeling sorry for them (for being deaf) to forgetting the disability and concentrating on how strong the main character is. Deaver's explaination of the Title of the Book is a particularly poignant scene."
1,JUNK!,"No where in the description of this product did it mention rebuilt, remanufactured, or refurbished. The pump came in a box that was beat up, had newspaper stuck in the outlet hole, and had a hand-written note on the cover of the owners manual. Clearly not a new pump, but I needed it and installed it. It didn't work either. Not Happy! I buy alot from Amazon but this is the second major issue I've had this year and can't help but wonder if they no longer require high standards from their suppliers. DON'T BUY!"
2,wawne water pump,"The wayne water pump sws50 failed after installing. I only ran for 5 min. then kicked the circut breaker. There must be something wrong with motor. I pur chased the pump to replace an aging pump that still worked so i was able to reinstall old pump. I did not get the pump installed right away. There was was 35 days from time of purchase. So i called the warranty hot line at wawne water pumps. they told me to send it back to where I purchased it. That any time I had problens with this product i would need to go through amazon. I called amazon would not send me another pump just refund my money and i may not get all of it back, because I was past 30 days.What a hassle I don't know if I will purchase large items again if manufacturer is going to give me a hassle about warranty because of where I purchased this item."
5,Working Great,"We originally installed this in May 2012 to replace an older pump that had gone out. As of February 2013, I can report no problems.Happy with the quality of the pump. I wouldn't buy one of the cheaper plastic models."
4,Pump is good Amazon's service was great!,The pump was ordered to replace a defective Wayne SWS50 pump which lasted only a few months. This replacment pump is working well. What I was most impressed by was Amazon's return policy and customer service. Amazon exceeded my expectations and I give them 5+ stars.
4,Great Pump!,"This is the second pump in last 20 years. The first one was my mistake, or could of lasted 40."
3,yellowing cuts,"cutting that yellow have too many leaves, and is trying to suck more nitrogen then it has available."
2,Disappointing,"I just received my book yesterday. Upon looking through it, I was quite disappointed. I expected a book ""for the vegetarian gourmet"" to use mostly fresh ingredients. The majority of the soup recipes (and several other recipes throughout the book) use boullion instead of vegetable stock made from fresh vegetables. In addition, while ""Boboli Pizza"" is quick and easy, I do not consider it to be a gourmet recipe. The recipes in this book are quick and simple, and a lot of them look fairly tasty, but I think it is a stretch for the author to call them gourmet."
1,Disappointed,I was really disappointed with the product. It is to thin and the chain turns a dark color after a few wears. I have only had this item for 3 weeks and have had to clean it four (4) times already. Would not recommend it for purchase.
4,I don't know of a better piano piece by Babbitt,The pivotal works on this lovingly planned disc (all the music was especially written for Nonken)are the Babbitt and Finnissy items.Allegro Peneroso by Babbitt bubbles over with chirpy melodic motifs ingeniously scattered around the entire keyboard and one is left wondering how all this warmth of spirit could possibly derive from a serial system of any kind.I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to hear the 2nd Piano Concerto which Nonken infectiously refers in her programme notes.Finnissy's discursive North American Spirituals might've collapsed in less imaginative hands than Nonken but she invests color and nuance where others might simply have forged ahead.An almost Baroque like clarity peeps through the murky ruminations and wrongly harmonised hymn tunes though the abrupt ending is paradoxiacally less startling than had things resolved more neatly.
4,Nondual prophesy,"In The Hebrew Prophets, Rabbi Rami Shapiro gets downright apocalyptic in many of his interpretations of Hebrew prophecy. The chapter titles say it all. From Ignorence... To Truth; From Injustice... to Justice; From Despair... to Joy.Shapiro is not afraid to wag his finger at the reader in his interpretations of the prophets, inviting us to step out of the darkness and into the light in his own imitable interpretation of those terms. As such, this text has a decidedly strident tone that is not found in some of his other works. But we can still find his uncompromising non-dualism in Hebrew Prophets, even in the prophetic garb.In this work, Shapiro psychologizes the message of the prophets, but in a very Jewish and Universalist framework. As such, there is something for many different types of readers in this well-written book."
4,"Great game, annoying issues","I love lemmings games in general, and this game is no exception, it is very fun to play. But there are two majorly annoying things about this game. One, is that everytime I start the game, I have to sit through a two minute AVI. No way to skip it. Pressing ESC, or any other key doesn't do it. So I burned a CD-ROM copy and replaced all the AVI files with blank AVIs. Problem solved (for me). Second issue: it runs ONLY at 640x480. Which means each pixel is 1/4"" square on my 20"" monitor (do the math). I don't think anyone ever made a 3D accelerator (required to run the game) that doesn't support 800x600, or even 1024x768. And unless you have an old 80386 machine with 8 Megs of RAM, you can most likely get good framerates even at 1024x768 (this is not QuakeIII, it is a cylinder fixed in the middle of the screen, with little lemmings walking around on it). Very annoying."
1,You Can't Go Home again.,"Disappointing. Fans of the former Lemmings games will be disappointed. The game requires installation of DirectX 7, supposedly included on the CD. After several attempts at installing the game and DirectX 7, the game would not play. The simplicity of the original game is lost."
4,Excellant Puzzle game for PC!! Addiction Personified!,"This game doesn't do too much to the Original Lemmings so maybe 'Revolution' was not an appropiate name for it. It does look and feel fantastic to play on the turning wheel mechanism with a very easy earling curve and interface.But beware - It DOES get tough and you will do well to complete all 200 levels (yes 200!)Reviews of this game were not to hot but this is one of the most addicitve games I've played in ages. Even my girlfriend (who is not a big games fan) is hooked and wont stop till the level is completed!!Theres not much to this game but the levels are well designed and its great for all Lemmings fans.The game hasn't evolved too much with 3d advances, new ideas and originlity. Many people may decide that this is just a cash in but I got mine for 19.99 so it wasn;t at full price.Its definitely more of the same with great graphics and gameplay.Pure addiction! Goodbye social life!"
5,Lemmings Revolution,Lemmings Revolution is the best Lemmings game out there. The old lemmings just dont cut it compared to this one. With all new puzzles this game never gets boring.
5,Another great Lemmings game,"For those of you new to Lemmings, they are puzzle-solving games (that get really difficult) that don't really require co-ordination. All in all, this is a great, mind-taxing, highly addictive game! If you know the other Lemmings games and liked them, you'll like this one too. This game has some new stuff; there are several different types of lemmings - some can walk on water - which helps complicate the puzzle-solving. Also, all the puzzles are rotated on a cylinder, which gets a bit annoying and doesn't really add anything. By the way, I don't have either of the problems that Hamid has. The game works just fine for me."
2,A really good game but buggy as all get out,A neat game to play with your son or daughter but has several serious bugs particualraly at the higher levels. I have not been able to find patches for the errors and the company seems completely out to lunch! If anyone has info please post...
2,Kind of junky,"Not really worth $250... ""leaves"" are just cut from flat sheet-metal, not all the candles are exactly vertical, and the chandelier i received was missing a hook for one of the crystals."
3,Nice looking.,"This is an attractive light fixture, however I was not pleased with the quality. The decorative leaves were easily bent (flimsy). I prefer a more substantial fixture."
1,Bad customer service,"The light arrived and was missing a few crystals. I contacted the seller for a few replacements and was told ""we are only an ecommerce company, we don't have parts"". When I pressed them they then said, I was past the 30 days I had (it took me about 60 days before I opened the box and hung the light). They were no help at all. So I called the manufacturer (World Imports) and they ultimately offered to send me a few crystals. I had to push pretty hard though as they wanted to to return the light and reship another. Well, I had the thing hung already. Just a huge hassle. Also, the wire they provide to hang the crystals has to be rigged and bent. I ended up going to Michaels and buying an earring post and made my own. All that being said, I think the light is very pretty especially at $150. The one star is for the seller not standing behind their product."
5,"BUY IT, IT'S GREAT!!!","This album is fantastic. I bought it last week and I listen to it several times a day. I bought it because I loved the song Bailamos so much and I had seen several interviews with Enrique on television in the last few weeks. He is very passionate about his music and his fans and it comes through on his album. The songs are really great. I am currently studying the Spanish language and even though I don't understand all the lyrics yet, Enrique conveys the meaning with the feeling and emotion in his gorgeous voice. There are two songs in English and even people who don't speak Spanish at all will enjoy the other songs. I love this album so much that I intend to buy all of Enrique's other albums, past and future!!!"
4,I love the song BAILAMOS!! I can listen to it forever!!,"Well, I think Enrique did an incredible job on the song BAILAMOS!! Personally, I couldn't stand Enrique's whining voice when he first started. Don't get me wrong he writes some beautiful songs like ESPERANZA! When I heard BAILAMOS, I was amazed with the great Spanish rhythm & the lyrics of the song. Well, about the rest of the album...I liked the original versions of the 2 songs that have a club music rhythm. Again, I have to say I LOVE BAILAMOS!!"
5,ENRIQUE IS MY TRUE LOVE ........,"Enrique's new album is great, well all of his albums are great. My favorite song is ESPERANZA because it's a beutiful song. I also like his new song BAILAMOS it's a song that you can dance to and i like that, in that song his voice is so hot! thats why i like his new ablum."
3,Remix version,"The product was delivered on time and in great condition. I was what I expected, except that there are a few tracks that are the remix version instead of the original song."
1,One word: GARBAGE,This is the worst cd i have ever heard!! it lacks any contentDONT BUY IT!!! Any cd on the shelf would surpass this one.
2,Bailamos all the way.,"Only the song ""Bailamos"" can stand the test of time. If you are non-latino (like me), you can safely switch off the CD after the first song. I am thankful to the manufacturers that the best song is the first one. I don't even have to forward the CD beyond the first one to listen to the rest of the songs. It might be attributed to my little knowledge of lingua-latino, but I am not sure. I bought this CD when the latino fever was at a feverish pitch. Ricky Martin, I forgive. Enrique, your album is all greek and latin to me."
5,enrique is the greatest,enrique is my favorite . singer the moment i heard bialamos he has been my favorite singer.i even like all the songs of his album named 'escape'.but it is really tough to describe his latest album'seven coz he's got that extra something in his smooth voice that clearly stands out.all the songs are a treat to ear.
5,GGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT,cool CD Man .... all his songs are cool
2,The song Bailamos is Great !!,"I bought the album for the song Bailamos, which is a fast-paced song with a latin rhythm. Unfortunately, most of the other songs on the album are slow, syrupy ballads. I was hoping for more of a mixture of fast and slow songs, and more of the latin sound. Thank goodness for the skip button !"
4,As a fan from Miami I think it is a very good start...,"The CD is very good and everyone is talking about the new song and how it is going to be in the mew movie ""The Wild Wild West"". The only thing is that the rest of the songs are repeated from his remix CD. But it is still very good and my friends and I really like it. Even the ones who are not Enrique fans."
1,English Crossover? DREAM ON!!,"The English song Bailamos is Enrique's awful attempt at trying to crossover, but unfortunately, he does not compare to Ricky Martin. His bad accent and vocals makes his English sound HORRIBLE. The rest of this collection consists of 2 new remixes from his last CD,(which was a major dissapointment) and some old songs from his first 2 CDs."
3,Why such popularity?,"Call me crazy, but when Enrique sings in Spanish he is just one of the many good singers out there singing in Spanish. When he sings in English he is the best, in a class by himself, an unmatched talent. Some people seem to like this better, I don't know why. Compared to Cheo Feliciano he is just average."

5,ENRIQUE - THE KING OF POP,ENRIQUE IS SURELY THE THE KING OF POP.HIT AFTER HIT.I FEEL HE SHOULD BE DECLARED A LEGEND.HE HAS IMPROVED HIMSELF SINCE HIS FIRST SINGLE.I AM A GREAT FAN OF HIM.I ALWAYSADMIRE HIS SONGS .HE IS MY FAVORATE SINGER AND HE WOULD ALWAYS BE.I WISH HIM ALL THE BEST FOR HIS FUTURE.RECENTLY IBOUGHT HIS NEW SINGLE 'SEVEN'.OVERALL IT IS A PEEPY COLLECTION.MY FAVORITES ARE'CALIFORNIA' AND'ADDICTED.HIS SMOOTH VOICE TRUELLY RULES.
5,I JUST LOVE BAILAMOS I HEAR IT MORE THAN 10 TIMES A DAY,"I JUST LOVE BAILAMOS I HEAR IT MORE THAN 10 TIMES A DAY CAUSE WHEN I HEAR IT I FEEL ROMANTIC, EXCITED,... I JUST WANT TO DANCE. I ADORE YOU ENRIQUE EGLISIAS, I WISH I COULD SEE YOU PERFORMING LIVE."
5,Just perfect for any mood that you are in!!!,"This album has a little bit of everything for anyone. If you could only buy one album of Enrique's, this one should be the one. This album has a little taste of how good the rest of his albums are."
5,ENRIQUE IS WAY BETTER THAN RICKY MARTIN,"HEY, HOW MANY OF YOU PEOPLE LOVE ENRIQUE, OH YEAH I KNOW THAT IT'S MORE THAN 100,000,000,000,000,000, BECAUSE HE IS NUMBER ONE AND NO ONE, NO ONE CAN IS BETTER THAN MY MAN ENRIQUE IGLESIAS!!!!!!!! THANKS WITH LOVE FROM ELIZABETH"
2,Avoid This,"Bailamos Greatest Hits was released by Iglesias' first recording label, Fonovisa, after he had left them and signed with Interscope (who promptly sued Fonovisa for using Iglesias' first Interscope hit song ""Bailamos""). Despite the title of Greatest Hits the album contains mostly album tracks which were never released as singles (""Nunca te Olvidare"" and ""Esperanza"" were both hits for Iglesias but appear here as radicaly altered remixes.) Despite the album not being endorsed by Iglesias or his management, it sold over a million copies worldwide. The album was released during the period in which Iglesias was recording his English debut abum and it has been speculated that many bought the album mistakenly thinking that it was his first English crossover album. Beware."
4,"""Bailamos"" has potential in English cross-over.","I really like Enrique's voice, much more than Ricky Martin's. Unfortunately ""Bailamos"" is not as strong as his two previous releases. If Enriques wants to cross over to English, he should write his lyrics in English and not translate Spanish to English. The songs would flow so much better."
1,E.I. - What a Waste,"I love E.I., including some his father's music so when I heard about this CD, I rushed out to buy it. And, to this date, I regret it.The album has a poor mid-to-late eighties sound (with the exception of the first track). The musical instrucments don't blend well with his crowey voice. Electric guitars don't help him any either. Therefore, to all the die-hard fans, stay away.This album is a disappointment"
5,Fantastico,"I choose this CD for my free gift for upgrading to realjukebox and I'm listening to it as I write this review. It's a great mix of toe tappers and moving ballads. Since I'm bi-lingual I am able to enjoy the lyrics and sing along. I do prefer the songs which are sung in Spanish. I especally enjoyed the haunting Falta Tanto amor which loosely translated means without any love. and the catchy Vivire y Morire (gonna live gonna die) For Spanish speaking fans, I'd like to say nesasitas comprarle. A must have."
1,"For the Love of God, don't buy it!","In regards to the last review: I have heard Latin music before, and this simply isn't it. Enrique is Latin American, but he has butchered the sound of his people's music so much that it is a disgrace. There's no room for a techno beat in a Latin song, and anyone who is truly interested in hearing soulful Latin music should put down this album and slowly back away. Instead, buy Buena Vista Social Club-now THAT is real Latin music. But, if you're a tone-deaf teenie-bopper who cares more about how a musician looks than how good his music actually is, then by all means, throw mommy and daddy's allowance money away on this."
4,A lovely little exhibition catalogue,"This is an exhibition catalogue on pre-Columbian textiles held at the Bruce Museum of Arts in 1999/2000. It's not a large book with only 44 pages. It does however have some beautiful illustrations (it's all in color)and examples of pre-Columbian textile work in the Andes. The work covers most of the different cultures that flourished in the Andes up to and prior to the Inca. There is also weaving and featherwork on featherwork on display. A slim, but very nice book with a good selection of items. This book is heavy on illustrations, light on text, but each section has a nice succinct introduction to the culture of the items being illustrated."
5,Nice set of speakers.,"I was cautious about purchasing these speakers due to the low price. I must say that they are excellent! They produce amazing low frequencies even though the woofers are small and the highs are crisp and clear without being overpowering. To top it all off, they even look great! I highly recommend this set of speakers.-dougl"
5,a very musical pair of speakers,"The vendor AcousticSounddesign shipped out the tower speakers promptly. The tower speakers (one in each box) arrived undamaged, to my relief. These Acoustech HT-75 speakers doesn't need that much power to produce decent volume, living up to the ""high-efficiency"" description. The sound coming out is bright, accurate, quick and detailed. For more low end, a sub-woofer is recommended to go with these tower speakers. The construction is on the thin/light side. I suspect that if the huge front port is made any smaller, resonance will form inside due to the light construction. Overall, these speakers look as good as they sound. A good value for sure."
5,A Great Book!,"This book kept me on the edge of my seat till the very last page. Wow! What a ride!! This true account of three people lost at sea in a capsized trimaran has several themes going on at once. The struggle for survival against all odds, the struggle against religious fanaticism, and basic human nature when it is put to the roughest of tests.Bob Timinenko's courage and unbelievable strength was such an inspiration. On the other hand, I became so frustrated with Jim Fisher that, as another reviewer has stated, I wanted to dive into the book and shake some sence into him!That is the way this book is. Once you start reading, you will become so involved with the lives of these three people, that you will not be able to put it down. It is way more than just another true adventure story.I highly recommend it!"
3,Times have changed,"I bought ""Stay Away Joe"" on the recommendation of a good friend who read it in the 1070's and who thought it was one of the funniest books they had ever read. I didn't laugh once from the first to last page. Why? Because I think this is really a fair depiction of much of what went on in day to day Native American life on the Reservations of North Central Montana at that time. And it wasn't (and isn't) funny or pretty!!! However, the view and appreciation of their circumstance has changed radically in Montana over the last 40 years. So Stay Away Joe can now be read as evidence of an ugly part of Montana's history highlighting issues that still exist (hopefully to a lesser degree) and which continue to deserve a lot of thoughtful time, consideration and attention."
2,"sadly, a shoddy work","Arthur Ashe made many fine contributions to America, but this isn't one of them. Not up to the standard set by the other books in the series."
5,"Godzilla Vs. The Oxy ""Pad"" Gen Destroyer","It`s an amazing film with amazing effects, my favourite is Godzilla`s death, such sad music....i loved it.The end scene was such a passionate and unforgettable one, just like the ending of Godzilla 1985...i loved the endings to both films. You should get a copy of Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah, Gary recommends it as a-must-see Godzilla film....>"
5,Godzilla 2000,"Godzilla 2000 is the BEST Godzilla movie EVER! It had great special effects, and it had the best monsters. I went to see it when it first came out in theatres, and couldn't wait for it to come out on video so that I could buy it!"
4,Great movie but the dubbing stunk!!!,"This is definitely one of my favorite Godzilla movies, however, I'm one of the lucky ones who has seen the original subtitled version. The dubbing stunk on this movie. It seems that Tri-Star, when they released these new Godzilla movies in the last year, put their C team on them. Anyway, The special effects are really good, except the scene where the little detroyers are swarming around. The story is great- Godzilla on the verge of nuclear meltdown. The movie is very emotional-Junior's apparent death and the death of Godzilla. Man, that scene where Godzilla melts makes me want to cry. Akira Ifukube's music during this scene is among his best themes. Amidts all of the movie's apparent flaws, I highly recommend this movie. If you can get a copy of the subtitled letterbox version."
3,godzilla dies?,"i haven't actually seen this dvd, but i have both of them on separate vhs tapes.godzilla vs. spacegodzilla is a great godzilla movie! my favorite in the heishi (Did i spell that correctly?) series! if rodan and baragon had been in it, and if it didn't have the scene with the spider in it, than it would have been perfect! i loved it!but godzilla vs. destroyah is mostly garbage. godzilla vs. megalon was a lot better than this. hopefully, godzilla final wars will end the godzilla series better."
2,lousy movie and a phenomenon,since i cant rate it a 3.5 im going with 2. first off space godzilla. ilike space godzilla but the director mustv been the hedorah faluire who i hear is directing the new godzilla movie. very bad and gives this pack a bad name. i recomend destroyah.now destroyah is really coll.and this movie did a god job ending the heisei series. the ending was depressing because 1 godzilla was melting 2 the muisic was sad 3 they did a good job with the camera. i recomend going to [...] (destroyah only) if you can get it to the us. i have a goal of collecting every godzilla movie so yeah...
2,It's not what I heard,"I was sorely disappointed. Sorry, guys, but this was a waste. I love BigG, but the writers were really stretching this time. To summarize the plot, a scientist revisiting the destructive power of the Oxygen Destroyer (""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"") creates (inexplicably) monster-sized micro-organisms which can, at times, mutate into one giant monster. This behemoth of a bacteria (Destoroyah) spontaneously degenerates into little bugs and reforms time and again. The whole movie is just too trippy for my taste--I loved King of the Monsters, GvsMechaG, Destroy All Monsters, and GvsSpazeG, but Destoroyah shames the good name of Godzilla."
5,Sweet Godzilla,"I will tell you about both movies:Godzilla Vs. Space Godzilla: Created from the cells that Biollante shot into space, Space Godzilla forms and heads towards Godzilla and his son. While a madman tries to take down Godzilla by weapons....Space Godzilla and Godzilla clash, while a super robot tries to help the King Of Monsters to defeat the invader from Space!Godzilla Vs. Destroyah: As Godzilla's body starts to meltdown, scientists beleive they only have limited time, untill Godzilla's meltdown destroys the Earth. In the meanwhile a type of chemical monster forms....Destroyah! As the monster causes damage in Tokyo, it seems the only way to stop Godzilla from destroying Earth is to put a device known as the Oxygen Destroyah in the water, which will destroy Godzilla. But as Godzilla fails to defeat Destroyah...his son Godzilla Jr. takes hold of the battle!"
5,A monster movie classic.,"This movie is the perfect climax to this series of Godzilla films. The plot, graphics, and music combine to set the atmosphere for the death and resurrection of Godzilla. The ending of the movie will bring a tear to any Godzilla fan of any age.This movie is a great prequel of the Godzilla movies to come in the next century."
5,"Good-bye, sweet king.","This was the saddest thing I've ever seen! I hardly ever cry, but I couldn't help it! It had spectacular SFX (waaaaaaaaaaay better than those cheep modern Gamera films)! This isn't a must-see, it's a can't-miss!"
5,"GODZILLA DIES ON SCREEN, BUT NOT OFF SCREEN","When I first heard about this film, I hated and said I would never buy it. Why? BECAUSE GODZILLA DIES! I been a G-fan since Kindergarden I'm in the 6th grade now)and he was going to die. He's better than even King Kong! But this was because I thought the series was going to end. But soon I heard about and waited for ""GODZILLA"" (1998, and I must say I was really disaptend). And ""GODZILLA 2000: MULLENIUM"" (1999) has been relased, and is going to be relased in U.S.A. on August 11, 2000. Plus, Toho has annouced it's seqale, ""GODZILLA VS. MEGAGUIRAS: G-ERADICATION OPERATION"" which sould be relased in Japan this December.When I bought ""GODZILLA VS. DESTROYER"", it was preety good. And with Godzilla Jr. still alive, it just goes to show you: You can't keep a popular monster down."
4,You mean there were Godzilla movies made in the 90's?,"Tell most people that there were many Godzilla and other Toho monster films made in the 1990's they look at you with a blank stare. The only current Godzilla movies most folks are aware of is the big, lumbering, boring Tri-Star film of two years ago.Lots of fun, action, and the certainty that there is, in fact, an actor in a rubber suit smashing fake buildings...(isnt that the real reason we watch Godzilla movies? ) much more fun than some nerd computer programmer pushing buttons, eh?I worked in a video store that owned a copy of the Japanese laserdiscs of these movies and they never failed to get a big response from our customers any time we played them!My only complaint is the lack of any supplemental material, and no Japanese soundtrack. But, I suppose having two films on one disk prevented that....and dubbed in English is better than not existing at all...and they ARE letterboxed, so I suppose that is all I can ask for!"
4,GODZILLA'S FINAL BOW A GREAT ACTION/ADVENTURE STORY,"This is what the TriStar atrocity should've been like! Fast-paced action, great story, and outstanding effects that didn't rely on cartoonish computer animation! The opening attack by Godzilla on Hong Kong is terrifying, and the drama surrounding the monster's imminent meltdown is top-notch. Fortunately, Toho is new working on their own new Godzilla film for December 1999, ""Godzilla Millennium."""
5,Very Good Godzilla Movie!!!,"Godzilla vs Destroyer is awesome! If you haven't seen it, I wont say anything. This one is one of my favorites. My very favorite is Godzilla vs Spacegodzilla. The only one I havent seen is Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla 2 because it is not on video so no rating for that. I suggest you see and buy Godzilla vs Destroyer and Godzilla vs Spacegodzilla. I always say a godzilla movie is a good movie especially the heisis serie movies. You have to see THIS MOVIE!!!!!!"
5,Great double feature for Godzilla fans...,"At six bucks apiece, these two films are a pretty darn good deal. As a fan of forty years, all Godzilla movies seem enjoyable to me, but the second one (with the nasty Destroyah) is really well done. Heartily recommended."
4,I think godzilla vs.destroyah is awesome i hate to see godzi,the melt down in the movie was awesome i didnt know godzillas body was going to disolve.
4,I would prefer the Japanese version instead,"Although I have seen both the English and Japanese versions, I would have to say to those Godzilla fans out there: Watch the Japanese version instead. I will admit that watching Godzilla die is hard, but at the film's end Godzilla Jr. has grown up to take his father's place. The Japanese version's translations are precise, but the English translation of the film doesn't follow the movie itself. But all in all, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is one movie that you don't want to miss."
5,"very, very sad movie (Still, I liked it.)","This movie was the ultimate. Godzilla looks cooler, and Destroyah awesome. At the end, when godzilla dies, I felt it. It was hard to watch him die. MIKE"
4,Double the monster action,This is a double feature dvd set.1 of them is Godzilla vs Spacegodzilla and Godzilla vs Destoroyah.If your a Godzilla fan like me than i reccomnd this set.
3,Could have been Alot Better!,Don't aspect much from this movie. It is better then Godzilla Vs Mecha-Ghidora but not by much. It was A sad script or maby I was aspecting to much this being the movie the big G dies in. But if you like Godzilla has I do you'll still buy it.
3,Startin' to Hate Double Features!!,"My second heisei DVD and to a pretty low quality. Unlike ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II"", the Japanese audio tracks aren't included in either film and still no Toho logo. Same old boring menus. No wonder its two films for the price of one, what crummy quality!! This DVD makes the GMK DVD look good."
5,Gozilla is awesome,Who doesn't love Godzilla? They are so bad they are GREAT. A wonderful collection to watch on a rainy cold Saturday as you sit on the couch eating cereal.
3,Continues the Godzilla Tradition,"This film honors the Godzilla tradition of dealing with political issues metaphorically. The themes of Hong Kong being returned to China and the controversy regarding the O-Daiba area of Tokyo, which was planned for the World's Fair, appear in the film. Much of the music is variations on previous scores. The B&W sequence at the end, a nostalgic look back on the genre with the Godzilla theme playing, was edited from the English version, big disappointment."
5,Gojira tia Disroyah (Godzilla vs. Distroyah),"I got this movie in origonal Japanese format (subtitled), and all I could saw was ""WOW""! Then I find out that it came out in the U.S.! Basicly, it is a great movie with an amazing climax, but to understand it, you have to get G. vs. Machagodzilla '93, and G. vs. Spacegodzilla '94."
3,The End of Godzilla,"Godzilla vs. Destroyah is a good film but this DVD is a mixed bag. First of all, it combines it with Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla. This makes sense in a way, because that was the next-to-last film. But it is also the weakest of the last five Godzilla films. (Somehow, one of the best, Godzilla vs. Mecha-Godzilla, seems to have been skipped for DVD.)Also, while the DVD quality is good, the cut most of the credits to Godzilla vs. Destroyah. The credits in the film are supposed to run for a couple of minutes, with scenes of a number of Godzilla films showing while they role and the appropriate Godzilla soundtrack music playing. The DVD chops this after about 10 seconds or so. I don't understand this, in that DVDs are aimed at the real movie fans, and that's just the kind of stuff real movie fans would like.My rule in the future for Godzilla DVDs: rent before I buy, and don't buy if they do such things."
4,Go Go Godzilla,"If you like Godzilla these are pretty good movies, I highly recommend them and my triplet boys love them as well. I gave these four stars as far as Godzilla movies go, Space Godzilla is one of the better of the recent Godzilla films."
5,Drag queens love this,"Ever since I saw this back in the late 1980's, I have been obsessed with it. it is quirky, funny, and drag queens have been performing parts of it for years. Me & Mrs. Jones is a personal favorite. My friends and I will try to slip lines from the show into our everyday conversation whenever we can."
4,This DVD is crazy!,"I remember seeing this DVD a long time ago when it was a special on HBO. I recently found it and purchased it. I laughed as much now as I did then. Highly recommended if you like raw, in your face, comedy."
3,The live audio release was better....,"...as this just comes across as a little too ""staged"". Sandra's live show that this is based on was released on audio cassette many years ago (1988?), and is a very vivid listening experience--you feel like you are there. This movie, however, leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied. I saw it when it first came out at the theater, and while we all had a grand time, showing it to friends afterwards, I became aware that this presentation is a bit too dry for most, and watching it alone, it isn't nearly as funny. However, it's still a decent flick, but you would be better advised to get either The King of Comedy or I'm Still Here, Dammit! for your Bernhard fixes."
2,Odd Duck,"This movie is an odd duck. If you watched it in 1990 when it came out then you'd probably think it was funny (like I did) but after buying it in 2006 and watching it again - I could barely sit through it! Sandra's humor is very ""New York"" and in some ways very sophisticated so if you don't know the name of designer furniture and clothing many of her jokes will go over your head as could many of the jewish and ethnic jokes. If you're into that type of humor then you might find it hysterical. It's a musical in case you didn't know but some of the songs are VERY SLOW (and, um, sorry to say... boring.) At the end of the movie she does strip down to a stars & stripes bikini and dances away to Prince (formerly known as) - which could be worth the price of admission for some."
5,One of a kind,"This movie, WITHOUT YOU I'M NOTHING, is based on Sandra's off-broaway, smash hit one woman show. Whew.. that was a mouthful. Anyway I wasn't familiar with Sandra's work before I saw this but after I saw this, I was floored. It's funny, touching, silly, and crazy. It's one of the best movies/shows I've seen. During WITHOUT YOU I'M NOTHING Sandra takes jabs at people but she's also an incredible storyteller/comedian. She also sings and dances thoughout. This movie is like no other. It's dark humor, crazy stories, and Sandra's eccentric attitude is sure to entertain."
2,They need a divorce attorney,This is the only book I read where I thought the characters would need a divorce attorney before the end of the year.
1,Just not good.,"Started off well. Then, went down hill. It didn't focus on characters, made it boring. Tried to fit too much plot into a small book. It didn't work."
3,Cute but not in Japanese as advertised,"I'm sure all the fairy tales will be cute. The biggest disappointment was that while the audio languages listed are Japanese and English, the audio is English, French & Spanish. My daughter just began Japanese school and I was looking to support her learning."
2,Did not live up to expectations,"Did not live up to expectations, other always seem to bully Hello Kitty, hard for an adult to sit through, drags a bit."
2,Not the DVD kids wanted,"Contrary to another review, this did not contain the same stories the kids wanted, such as CinderKitty and Snow White kitty. Nor did it contain The Phantom of the Theater, Frankencat, Catula, The Pawed Piper and Rumpeldogskin as indicated in another review. Check carefully if you are looking for a specific Kitty DVD."
3,Good review and inspirational messages,Thought this was more expository that it turned out to be. A little disappointed in that. Should have read the reviews closer.
2,some other time...they made a good debut,"the only thing i have to say about this record is that only 4/5songs are worth the band's debut, which was a really great album."
3,Fun and good for the price but nothing great,Not much energy from 101 Strings but if you enjoy these old classics it's worth the money they are usually cheap.
3,Errrr.....,"Guess I have got the wrong book. I am looking for a book on female tricster of Native American literature but this book delves the muslim female trickster. The author indeed has collected ample stories but unfortunately, without specific explanation. So, if you are looking for a book with stories, this is it. If you are for a book with analystic information, you'd better try another one. There is some, but definitely, not enough.By the way, this book is toooooo expensive...."
1,A waste of time and money.,"This product doesn't have the tools needed to design much more than a flat, square flower bed. The wizards and tools are not user friendly or complete.I have used Sierra LandDesigner for years and was looking for something with a larger plant base and better terrain handeling.I had seen a good review in a gardening magazine on this software, so I purchased it.I have just spent several frustrating hours trying to get the house and garage to remotely resemble my home.I am a computer programmer and have used PCs for landscape design for years.When is someone going to make a decent landscape design product?"
4,Believable yarn,"I hadn't read any books by this author and chose the book because I'm interested in reading about Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi. The story held my interest even though the language was certainly more salty than it needed it to be. My son told me that is how Moore's novels are. Good believable yarn. Would have given it five stars if it hadn't been quite so ""salty"" which is saying it nicely. I am a lady after all."
1,not what i expected...,i think this was old or something...it looked like the bottle had been used when i got it....and the packing was all tore up. I just threw it away...that was $20 that could have been better spent
1,VERY OLD PRODUCT !!!!,"I normally love this product but not this one and I'll explain why.Shipping was great I do applaud that but this product is sooooo OLD on the back it has the year it was made and when ever I buy this product in a reatail-store it's usually 2008 or 2009 but the one I was sent had 1999 on the back CAN YOU BELIVE! and the normal looking texture for this lotion is very white and creamy and smells okay but the one I was sent by this company was YELLOW & WATERY and smelled bad...This lotion works great for dissapearing strechted skin when its not older than my brothers! I messaged them about wanting a new one because the one I received was old and they told me no they wouldn't send me another with out paying for it, BUT they did say they would refund me if I sended it back but I doubt they would actually would and didn't want to take that hassel for just 20 bucks.. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS LOTION ONLINE ONLY IN STORE WHERE I CAN SEE YEAR IT WAS MADE"
1,Many Miles Away..a tribute to The Police,Some things are better left untouched. And this is the case with this cd.Being a professional touring musician this reeks with stink. I can't believe someone would release this to the public. Not a single track on this cd is worth anything.Next time leave it alone...The Police are the masters and you people are still in kindergarten.
5,The Language of Letting Go,This daily reader is the best one I've seen. The readings are appropriate for any issue one might be dealing with.
5,Another great Amazon experience!,I bought a used copy of The Language of Letting Go and it looked like I just brought it home from Barnes & Noble! And I received on time. What more can I ask for?! Thanks Amazon!
3,Great!,"This book is a great self help book if you have lots of willpower. I don't suggest this book for anyone who has serious addiction problem.Also, I got this on ""free Delivery"" as I purchased other items. The mail time to receive it was atrocious! I did not receive the package for more than 2 weeks!"
2,wallowing,"depressing. (Ha) really, though, i just can't imagine anyone wanting to put themselves through that kind of hell everyday. i think that we need to spend more time reading the many powerful novels that are out there - ones that let us laugh, cry and celebrate all the aspects of life's ups and downs. i think the book was written in the best intentions and with a true desire to share and help another individual and commend the author for sharing difficult times and pointing to faith based values for salvation. we could all use more of that in the world, but it just struck me as TOO, well, maybe boring is a good word, ...wallowing. i saw a lot of wallowing. also, all the separateness and disconnection may have been too much. it just doesn't feel healthy. probably said like a co-dependent, right?!!"
4,Good daily affirmations.,"This book is an excellent tool for one learing to cope without being dependent. Daily meditations/guidance is organized chronologically. The only bad comment I can male is that there is no way to look up a specific topic which is immediately pressing. But, this book is worth the $ to the ones who need guidance."
3,not impressed,"Although this is well written, some of it is sloppily thought out. I found it slightly helpful and I sure could use the help."
4,awesome!,"I found when I am looking for some words of wisdom or guidance, I open the book to a random page and there are the words. Try it and you will see that it isn't just some random words. Your higher self is at work."
4,Daily Inspiration,"I bought this book along with another of Melody's. I think she is a very caring and understanding person and this book gives me daily readings to keep up my spirits and know that I am not alone and I can fix my own problems. I wasn't expecting a daily devotional type of book, but I am so glad now that I have it. They say one day at a time.. and right now that's what I'm giving."
2,Book for a friend,"The book that I ordered was for a friend. When I ordered it the rating of it's condition was good; the book arrived in ""outwardly"" good condition but when I opened it there was a very personal and romantic inscription written inside the jacket. It seems to me that the seller A. reduced the rating/price and B. Checked the book more throroughly.At that point it was too much trouble to go through the return/refund so I made a joke about the cover in my inscription to my friend and gave it to her.One other problem: the mailing return address on the package had a name that did not match the sellers name/business on line. Since I had ordered 2 of the same book at the same time, but from different sellers, I didn't easily know who to contact about the book. And there was no receipt/invoice in the package..."
1,language of letting go,"HAS ANYONE NOTICED...ITS ALOT OF GOD BEING USED IN THIS BOOK, BUT NO BIBLE VERSES TO REFER THEM TO. WHAT KIND OF A PERSON WHAT PUBLISH A BOOK LIKE THAT? WHY IS SHE TRYING TO DECEIVE US? WHAT IS HER TRUE INTENTIONS? THE 12 STEP PROGRAM. AND CONNECTING. 2 DIFFERENT LANUGUAGES. DONT WALK AWAY - (RUN AWAY) FROM THIS BOOK. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOU MIND. BUY A DIFFERENT BOOK. AND ANYONE THAT LIKES THIS BOOK. I WOULD HATE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. IF YOU CAN GRASP WHAT I JUST WROTE. JUST BEING HONEST."
5,Love this book,This book helped me so much thru a difficult situation. I pick it up whenever I need reassurance. Great book.
3,Great,Love this book. I never knew this was my problem and my therapist told me about this book and it has helped so much!
5,life saver,This book says it all for me n as a counsellor I recommend it to my clients that are struggling to make sense of wounded ways of existing that defeat the very thing they seek most - self acceptance.
5,Start your day right,The Language of Letting Go is my daily reading. I first purchased the book 20 years ago and I have found that giving it as a gift is so very much appreciated by all. The readings are so relevant to everyday life and they only take a few minutes to read.This is one of the best books I own and I think everyone should own a copy. You can't go wrong with this one! So glad I can get it on Amazon!
5,Great for everyday use,"This is a wonderful book for anyone. It helps you deal with the issues that plague us all....from self doubt, self esteem, and the feelings we've had from how others have treated us.I buy this book as a gift and I own one myself."
5,"A ""must have"" in daily meditations","This book is a ""must have"" for people learning to grow and move beyond codependency and the effects of a dysfunctional family. The down to earth daily meditations are insightful and clear. This book is a staple for any self-help library."
5,Easy does it,"Although I just started reading this book in April 2009, I've found it to be very helpful in starting my day with a positive and soothing message. I believe that it is written from an Al-anon angle, but works fine for an AA angle as well. The book covers many topics (via a daily passage /reading)that are potentially difficult for those in recovery (and those who don't have a program as well). I highly recommend this book to anyone (in a program or not) that is looking for a daily meditation book to help them deal with everyday issues (internal and external) that are beyond their control. The book avoids religion yet remains very spiritual in an easy going, no nonsense (non-new agey) manner."
5,Recovery for Anyone a Woman or Man,This book has an inspirational meditation for every day of the year. I have had mine for 6 years and I purchased 4 for some friends and they love it. It gives me things to think about for the health of my mind and soul on a daily basis. I love this daily meditation book.
5,Love This Daily Read,I love this book. This is the 5th copy I have purchased for friends.The daily reflections are short enough to read in a few minutes but are powerful enough to keep you thinking and reflecting all day.This book is a daily part of my life.
5,Great book,This book was recommended to me a while ago and I have found that everyday it mirrors where I am and helps me get through the day or at least reflect. I love it.
5,The Language of Letting Go,"I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has lost a relationship especially for any reasons beyond their control, because this book will help in the letting go process of the loss of the relationship."
5,THE BEST DAILY DEVOTIONAL BOOK EVER,"Ms. Beattie offers depth and encouragement to life's daily problems and adventures... I have had this book for 2 years and keep giving it to persons that I know are hurting, because it is such a good book of daily life lessons... DEFINITELY A BUY!!!"
2,Ok,Not what I expected it to be. More religious than I prefer and definately works with the AA platform which wasn't what I wanted.
5,Great gift for a broken-hearted friend,"I bought this book for a friend who was recently dumped (over the phone, no less!) She was inconsolable, but somehow Ms. Hirsh's words seemed to get through. At first, all she could handle was the great lists of movies to watch, songs to listen to, etc. But she eventually read the whole thing and is a whole new woman, even more confident than when she was with her idiot ex-boyfriend. Thanks for bringing my friend back from break-up hell!"
1,Boring,"This reads like 1,000 other articles that I have read in women's mags at the dentist's office. If you have never been to the dentist, or the doctor, or if you have never thumbed through a magazine while waiting in line at the grocery store, then hurry: READ THIS BOOK!"
5,Laughed so hard I forgot about my boyfriend,"This book is exactly what I needed at a most devestating time in my life. Ms. Hirsh remindes us that breakups are something we all go through and it is also something we can quickly get over if we have the right attitude. The book made me want to bond with my girlfriends, pamper myself and turn the whole ordeal into a positive, even fun experience. I ate anything I wanted, went to the spa, shopped with my friends and rented all of the movies the author recommended. She helped me realized that breaking up can actually be fun. Next..."
1,Repetitive,"I found this book to be repetitive and boring. I bought it because I thought it would make me laugh, but I never reallycracked a smile. It does not contain a hint of originality."
5,Every women should have a copy of this book,"Only a week ago I was sitting at home crying hysterically about my latest break up, and now I am even able to face him at work. All thanks to Ms. Hirsh. This book was a gift sent directly from heaven. It gave me confidence to pick myself up and get back out there."
1,Annoying,"After reading this book it becomes obvious why the author is, as the blurb says, ""the veteran of many break-ups."""
2,Good if you are high,"Legalize It, and read this book. The two together are a winner. The book alone is not worth it. But together, the two are a match made in heaven for the matchless on earth."
1,Colonel Mustard in the Library,"Fooled you! It wasn't really Colonel Mustard who killed me. It was boredom. Excruciatingly painful, death-inducing boredom! Before you too fall victim to this evil killer, buy a different book. As for Marnie Quinn whose review is ""spotlighted"" above, I'll give you ten-to-one that she doesn't really exist. Marnie Quinn is either a pseudonym for the author, or the editor, or the milkman of the author, or of the editor, or...of Colonel Mustard for all I care. There's no accounting for taste, but no real human being would actually find this book THAT enjoyable."
4,Sensitive and enjoyable,"Freeling mimics Simenon's ""Maigret"" in his Van der Valk character but misses Simenon's simplicity of touch and dialogue. Rather, Freeling finds his own entertaining voice in the atmospherics of Amsterdam, the countryside of Belgium and the mid sixties tension between the Dutch and Belgians. With two to three strong characters and believable dialogue, this mystery ends with a sensitive tragic love story in the last twenty pages but hiccups in the middle with the implausibility of Van der Valk solution to the crime."
2,Curious Coincidences,"This was the first Freeling book I've read. It's an easy read, and the characters and situations are very interesting, even engrossing. However, the book is driven by a string of highly improbable coincidences. A drunk just happens to remove the license plates from a car. The detective just happens to keep running into Lucienne on odd occasions and critical junctures. The detective just happens to be struck by a painting hanging on the victim's wall. Lucienne just happens to be in a location where some Italians just happen to be talking about the victim's wife, in a language Lucienne just happens to understand. The victim just happens to withhold from Lucienne his crucial conversation with his wife. Van der Valk didn't solve the mystery, the solution just happened to fall into his lap (with some loose ends that are never explained). So after following an interesting enough tale, one is left with a strong feeling of dissatisfaction."
3,Kind of hard to stay with,"I love that the Women Write Pulp people have reprinted this title. When I was a girl Gypsy had already hung up her G-string, but I loved Gypsy's talk show. My parents were slightly alarmed, but I found her amazing in a way I couldn't put words to at that age - brassy, ballsy, and uncowed I would say now. But I found this mystery very tough to get through. The writing left a lot to be deisred and unlike some other pulps it doesn't move along very well. Still I love that it's out there and it's historical/hystorical value makes it worth a look."
2,Pretty bad,Originally written in 1941 this is about a murder at a burlesque house and a bunch of strippers involved with it. The police try to figure it out but Gypsy Rose Lee and the fellow strippers will ahve to figure it out themselves.Needlessly convoluted and pretty poorly written. What's frustrating is that this has some well-written passages and interesting characters but then it just gets confusing and/or dull. Lee was obviously no author. It is a somewhat interesting look back at burlesque houses (which are long gone) and the people who worked them but that can't support the sloppy writing and confusing narrative. This was considered pretty risque back in 1941 but todays it's tame and silly. Some people love this (look at the other reviews) but i found it pretty bad.
1,The worst proofed book in the universe,"This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. I can't believe I'm writing this as a review, because I can normally overlook a few typos. However, the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read. I can't believe I paid money for it."
1,"Great Product, Horrible Shipment","Drive installation is pretty straight forward, but a bit clunky because of the way the steel brackets clamp together. The company did not think through how the duplicator controller should be placed, and the connecting cables get wired. The case weighs a ton when it shouldn't have- e.g. the company could have used aluminum instead of steel, which would've made it lighter and better for heat dissipation.The product was also shipped to me straight in its original box- no packaging to ensure things didn't break or chip, as they most certainly did. The rivets that the screws were going into had bent, making the case I received very unstable. I had to disassemble and re-assemble it with some patchwork fixes to make it stand straight. The case was bought a year ago and I did not have time to follow up on requesting a refund."
5,The perfect introduction to a towering talent,"If you've never read, Iris Murdoch, start here -- A Fairly Honourable Defeat is perhaps the most accessible of her more substantive novels. It's engaging, funny, deeply affecting, and provocative, with a plot that can be appreciated on many levels. No one need be daunted by the novel, and everyone will be entertained by this allegorical tale of the battle between good and evil."
3,"A bitter, rather nasty book","Of course Iris meant it to be bitter and nasty, a satire on upper middle class life and love in London in the 70's. I found most of the characters rang hollow. And Tallis' squalor and his annoying father seemed artificial and overdone. Having said that it was an interesting read. Not one of her better novels. Dare I mention that it does not compare favorably with some of the better Muriel Spark novels?"
2,Poor Quality,"I had it take it apart and reconnect one of the wires because one strand was crossing over to another terminal. The issue was the left turn signal circuit was overlapped with the brake, causing the brakes to engage when the left turn signal was applied! Once I took it apart, I realized what was happening. Poor assembly workmanship on Hopkins Towing's part, although once fixed, it works great."
1,"""rigged"" into an adaptor - NOT OEM","I received this adaptor in OEM packaging, but it was certainly not OEM. The female 7-way RV plug was attached through the male 6-way plug correctly, but the wires were haphazardly wrapped in a fabric-style tape. My 7-year old could have done a better taping job. For OEM, I would have expected a solid coated set of wires between the connectors."
4,works as advertized,"My truck was wired with a 6 plug round and I needed the 7 plug flat to hook up a fifth wheel. They wanted $90 to wire a new 7 flat plug in the bed of the truck and I couldn'tunderstand how to rewire from the websites so I opted for this adapter. Works as advertized. My only problem is that because of its weight and how it hangs off the bumper, it could work its way loose and come apart while driving."
5,Robin's Book are Solid,"I think I have every one of Robin's books, except the Apocalypse Chow one. I find her books to be reliable, but this one might possibly be a fave, if I had to pick one. The lemon-mint pesto rice with beans was one of the best meals I've had and the leftovers were great cold. Make some extra rice tonight and have dinner started for tomorow! Also includes recipes for lesser known rices."
5,Evolutionary Progressive Music,"This LP proved beyond doubt that Italian prog bands could be much more than derivatives from the UK bands like Genesis, Gentle Giant or Yes. The Banco del Mutuo Soccorso (or Banco, as everybody here in Italy calls them) was able to mix classical influences, electronic sound and astounding live performances. The gorgeous musical structures engineered by the musical minds of the band, the Nocenzi brothers (keyboards) were the background for the wonderful vocal performances of the singer, Di Giacomo, one of the greatest Italian voices ever. In case you like prog music, have enjoyed the likes of VDGG, Emerson, Lake & Palmer etc. and wish to try something a bit different, do try Darwin."
4,Amazing Italian Group,"This is one of the best albums of Banco. If you like prog you should try this album. The voice of Vittorio is amazing, specially in 750,000 Anni Fa l amore. This group with PFM showed us that not only England had good prog."
2,Tins bonded together,"Great idea but would be even better if the product worked 100% or even 80%. At least 3 of the 12 tins on the board have bonded shut somehow, so now I no longer have a usable tin and I can't use the spices that I bought and put in them .... a double waste."
4,Great Idea,"I purchased this item last week and it just arrived- I have a very tiny kitchen and decided not to use the actual rack- but put the tins on my fridge! Still a great value without the rack though, the spices seem like they are pretty good quality."
4,Decent spice rack.,"I really like this spice rack. I mostly use it for storing loose tea, it's the perfect size. I will be buying another one soon."
1,Dont do it! There are better options.,"I strongly suggest buying your own metal strip or board or painting your wall with magnetic paint and then buying some higher quality magnetic spice tins from a retailer elsewhere.These particular tins are made very cheaply. Spice gets stuck under the plastic front and metal edge, and it's pretty gross.They are easy to knock of the wall when you take one because the magnets are so weak.The magnets will eventually just fall off he back of the container and then the container will fall to the floor, getting dented and spilling spices.I have found much better options elsewhere, dont write off magnetic tins from these cheapies. They can and do work -- however these won't."
2,TIN magnetic Spice Rack,"I think I was just so excited about the price and when the only metal listed in the product detail was ""stainless steel"" I impulse purchased this. The containers are tin the STAND is stainless steel. The problem with tin is the smell and the durability. 2 of the 12 containers in my set came dented. The smell will definitely over take the spices eventually. I think in the product detail it also suggested this be used for crafts, I think that would be a better use."
2,Cheaper Than It Looks - Cheaper Than It Costs,"The product looks nicer online than it does in person. When I opened the box, the stand was intact, but 10 of the 12 magnets had popped off the back of the cannisters and I had to reglue them myself.There are 12 spices included with labels, but it would have been nice if they provided more pre-printed labels for other spices, or at least blank labels you could fill in yourself. Overall I'm pretty disappointed."
4,Stand Broke Off,"After reading the prior review, I was compelled to write. The rack looks great, works great, and does come with a full complement of spices. Unfortunately, my stand was also disattached from the face when it arrived. It is easy to see why as the metal attachments are very small and appear easy compromised. This is a design flaw. Fortunately, I was planning to hang mine anyway so I am staisfied with it."
3,A bit unclear,"I thought that I would be able to mount the whole silver back to my fridge, but it is meant to stand on the counter and has a back that doesn't allow it to be mounted. So I just stuck the containers to the fridge. It works fine, but not exactly what I expected."
5,Best Brandenburg,"Of all the Brandenburg Concertos I own or have heard, a list that includes accounts by Marriner, Pinnock, Goebel, Karajan, Klemperer and Menuhin among others, this is my favorite. Benjamin Britten, an astounding composer in his own right and a seemingly unlikely choice as conductor, leads the English Chamber Orchestra in truly magical performances from 1968. Please note that you can get these very same Brandenburg recordings as a Double Decker, or can just buy this title and its companion (Concertos 1-4) in the Penguin Classics series. Of course with the Double Decker set you get two incredible Bach Concerto performances by Neville Marriner tossed in, while here you get one Violin Concerto with Arthur Grumiuax. The Double Decker set also costs less than the two Penguin Classics titles, but either way you are getting the best Brandenburg available."
4,It was so hot this summer that mine melted!,"I purchased this hat two years ago and I used it mainly for kayaking. I loved the hat. But, this summer, it got so hot that the foam inside melted and shrank and so it's really small now with the excess outer fabric loose and wrinkled.Granted, Kavu does warn that if you leave the hat on a car or in the sun it will melt. But, why would one wear it in the shade? I think they need to update this hat with better materials that comply with global warming! hehehe"
5,Extremely Well Ventilated,"I bought this after trying on a friend's. I LOVE the look, first of all. But immediately after putting it on -- I was stunned by the ""airy"" feel of the hat. This hat is the best ventilated hat I am aware of. Not only does it provide fantastic coverage of your face and neck, but the part touching your head is mesh -- so that even on the hottest day, you can have a nice breeze across your pate. Absolutely fantastic hot weather hat! I have two of them."
2,Too small,"As the other reviews suggest, this hat is too small. The diameter should be increased by at least 6"". Other materials should be considered as well."
4,"Deserves attention by fans of Emily Dickinson, much material here","Even if you think you've read much of what is out there which foucses on Emily Dickinson, this book may provide new perspectives on her place in history and it will also give insight into the lives of Women Writers. The detailed appendix focusing on Dickinson and Pulication, notes, works cited and an index of poesm are all helpful.But the gist of this book is in its contention that Dicksinson was NOT exclusively a post-modernist poet. She combines literary history, contemporary feminisit literary theory and more to make her points. Intriguing!"
2,Looks nothing like the motion picture.,"Saw it on the bookshelf, grabbed it to buy it for my son who really liked the movie, opened it, returned it to the shelf. You don't buy a book like that for the story -- you buy it for the story and the pictures -- it's a book for younger children after all -- and you hope that the pictures will bring back the fond memories of seeing the story on big screen. But this book is so modestly illustrated that it seems totally unrelated to the film. Even the characters look different. All excitement and all that underwater magic are gone. 'Toy Story' -- from the same series of Disney books -- is illustrated much better."
2,disappointed,"Big disappointment. The illustrations are very poor. Nothing like the computer animated graphics in the movie. The characters look like the impressionists version of those in the movie. Bruce the shark is practically unrecognizable, neither is Nemo or Dory. The story is ok, too complicated for a younger child to follow."
3,Odd but an interesting premise,The gist of the story is revenge by Dr. LeSange against the town who didnt appreciate his ideas on behavior control...the music is typical tangerine dream and enhances the moodiness of the film..i saw this on HBO 20 years ago and videotaped it...not as shocking as when I first saw it except the scene where the cop's son is given the injection...ive seem worse horror films and would recommend it
2,Shoddy slasher peice!,A very strange film about kids being turned into murderers by a mad doctor. Notable only for a scene where a guy start's pissing blood!
4,A Garner good film,"I just watched the Warner Archive Dvd version of They Only Kill Their Masters. It stars James Garner. It was made in the 70's and is a gemI will not go into plots or bore you with a synopsis. I will tell you that it is a fun movie. With a stellar cast. Edmund Obrien,Peter Lawford and Harry Gaurdino just to name a few. The story is well plotted so you do not get bored while watching.Garner is the star and does well in carrying the movie. it is great to see him in something that did not just having him survive on his charm. It was this movie that had me actually start to check out other Garner films.I recommend this movie for mystery buffs and Garner fans. It is a bit steep in price so be willing to shop around."
3,Doberman's out-act humans!,"The doberman's are the ""gimmick"" in an otherwise average movie. However they are an impressive gimmick.The trainers get the dogs to do some amazing things. Imagine a ""Benji"" movie for grown-ups. If you are interested in animal training or dobermans, you'll like this movie."
3,"Simply written story, typical of Wells work","Like all of Wells' work, which I have read all but one of, the story is written with simple characters. None of Wells characters seems to grow much, and they make major decisions at the drop of a hat. Characters fall in love without actually having spoken to one another, and the romance is usually non-existant.The story was an intersting enough tale, that could have been helped with more character dialogue. Another 50-100 pages might have made the story truly good.I give the story 3 stars, based on the fact that the concept was good, but the character development and interplay was poor. As with most of Wells's work, it is more suited to a Junior High or early High School student than an adult.If you like strong character development and dialogue...skip this book. If you like a basic tale without too much of the above, then by all means, read it. Personally, I need more to really enjoy a book."
5,Wonderful First Classic Album,"This is Chayanne's first album after leaving the group los Chicos. It has excellent songs that just bring back so many memories of growing up. The song ""Y que culpa tengo yo"" was his very first big hit where he became known as a solo singer and known worldwide. The videos that were also filmed are lovely, innocent and humble as he has always protrayed himself to be. It is a shame that this cd is so difficult to acquire."
1,Para coleccionar..,Este album de Chayanne es con el que se da a conocer. Manteniendo aun el estilo del grupo de adolescentes del que proviene. Aun no se aprecia la calidad de interpretacion que ahora nos brinda en sus nuevas producciones.

3,Sat in during the original recording,"I was fortuate to be the photographer for this album. Interesting facts. The cover was a napkin drawing by a friend artist of the band. He flew in to Tampa from Los Angeles and surprised everyone with the restaurant napkin illustration. Randy loved it. The artist did some reverb vocals on the album. Randy enjoyed recording especially with his step dad Ed Cassidy. He had written many songs for the recording which did not end up on this album. Randy was nice to speak with. The concert was in Tampa and also recorded there over a few week period. Though this music in my opinion is no where the level of the original Spirit, at the time it was good seeing two original members play together. Barry Keene was the bass player. The band's manager was the nephew of Milton Bearle.It was a great experience for me and am very excited that it's on a C.D. I will buy it with fond memory's of the experience ."
1,Music Dribble,"I am a late commer as a Randy California/Spirit fan. I mainly know Randy's music from the posthumous albums, and also ""The 12 Dreams"". I listened to ""12 Dreams"" a lot when it first came out. I have been listening to it, and three or four Randy California posthumous albums lately. I think I can only recomend ""Spirit od 76"" for those die-hard Spirit fans who want to know where Randy, and the band was at in 1976. For me overall the album was meandering, and very dated. There were only a couple bright spots in the 2 disc album. I listened to it twice, and then pitched the album in the trash. I knew I would never listen to it again. Over-all a disappointing experience. To me, only of value to see how Randy, and the band had progressed. I can highly recommend ""Cosmic Smile"", ""Sea Dreams"", and even ""Son of America"". But not this album. - btk"

5,My favorite pan,"This is one of my favorite pans. I love making casseroles and this pan is just the right size for me, I always have enough left overs for taking to work. I think I hear some chicken and dumplins calling me from the kitchen right now..."
5,GUY ECKER es caliente!,"Lots of action, hot soundtrack, the movie has four letter words, some nudity, hence the MPAA 'R' rating. An inde production, the producers made a small budget go a long way. Puerto Rican location is fantastic. ""Let the Love Begin"" should be a single CD (movie soundtrack). A BIG low-budget production. Don't Miss it!!!"
5,"""DINERO SANGRE"" (Blood Money) EN ESPANOL!","Filmed on location in PUERTO RICO in WIDESCREEN , this colorful action-adventure drama stars GUY ECKER, of Spanish-language Novelas (""SALOME""2002).

3,No Ginger Taste,"I bought these because the Altoid Ginger mints are no longer availabe in stores and you need to spend $20.00 or so and get boxes of them at Amazon. Unfortunately, these ginger candies did not do the trick for my nausea. They don't even taste gingery. They do have a pleasant enough taste though."
3,Somewhat soothing...,"I was looking for anything to ease my pregnancy nausea. I read good reviews about these candies, so I promptly ordered them. Although they don't really take the nausea away, they do provide a somewhat soothing relief and take the edge off a bit. I've found that with my pregnancy sickness, I often get a yucky taste in my mouth after I eat, but chewing gum makes me feel even worse for some reason. These at least leave a pleasant taste in my mouth."
1,Really wanted to like these,"I got these in an effort to combat the combination of morning sickness & carsickness on a two-day bus ride I was taking. I really wanted to like them, but the taste was absolutely awful. If you're thinking ginger flavor like ginger ale, this isn't even close. They were spicy and bitter and just plain icky - I tried twice, but couldn't keep one in my mouth longer than about 45 seconds. Bummed that I wasted the money on these, I could have bought Preggie Pops instead for the same price - and they actually taste good!! Would recommend ginger root capsules instead."
2,Expired?,"These candies taste okay, and helped with morning sickness a very tiny amount ... but the ones I received were long since EXPIRED! ....Why would anyone be selling expired candy on Amazon?! Maybe if they were FRESH they'd have tasted better and worked better too."
5,Gin.Gins,"I really like the taste of this candy, just the right amount of ginger.I have to take a fair amount of medicine in the morning after I eat breakfast. I find at different times, I will become nause or get an upset stomach from the medicine. Gin.Gins candy really stoothes my stomach and makes it feel better. I even use this candy as a breath mint, when out and about I take along some of this candy in my purse to refresh my breath."
1,yuck,"I bought these while I was pregnant because I was having terrible morning sickness. Me thinking I was getting something I could actually take was very wrong. These are not what I would call ""candy"" They are very spicy when you put them in your mouth. I did not have more then 2 before they went in the trash. I would rather have morning sickness then eat these."
2,Gin Gins,"Well, I tried them but did not enjoy them. I like gingerale but I guess I don't like ginger candies. If you like ginger you may enjoy these."
3,okay for morning sickness relief,"From week 6 to week 12 of my pregnancy I threw up twice a day, and felt nauseous almost 24/7. I took anti-nausea medicine, but still felt awful and was searching for any relief. These got good reviews so I ordered 2 bags. I didn't even finish half a bag. They were ok, and somewhat took the nauseous edge away, but they weren't my first choice to try for relief. Honestly the best relief I got for morning sickness were sour icebreakers, and then lemonheads. I would buy these Gin Gins only if you enjoy ginger flavor and would eat them as regular candy anyways."
2,Cant say for sure...,"Basically, they worked while I was sucking on one. But it felt like a jolly rancher or especially sour apple rings worked the same if not better...I dont think anything would of worked for me at that time in my life. Maybe for mild nausea this product would be better but not for severe nausea."
5,Just love this candy,"I usually get this ginger hard candy from ""Down to Earth"" store but they were out of it for over a month. Decided to order it from Amazon. I use it especially when I feel a cold coming on or coughing. It really soothes the throat and clears up congestion. I prefer the hard candy over the chews although the chews are good too. It also helps when your throat is dry. It's worth it with the free shipping."
1,yuck,"I hated this for my morning sickness, too sweet, made me even sicker. no thank you! I would recommend the Preggy Pops"
5,awesome shirt,"This shirt is awesome; I am surprised how many people walked up and talked to me about Meshuggah; even people who don't know who they are like the design. Hell yah, it's sweet."
3,The language and images are compelling,"But I couldn't finish this book. This is not the sort of book I'd normally choose to read but it was assigned by my book club. I savored the lovely images and have a great respect for the originality of the story, but ultimately I didn't care enough about the characters or the plot to continue with this lengthy read. Loved the opening chapter and was really pulled in with it, but then I got bored."
5,SHOULD BE 10 STARS!!!!!,What an incredible book!! Plot was so unusual - so intriquing - so engrossing - I couldn't put it down! I look forward to reading more by this author - but I wonder if anything can top this story. Read it for the ultimate reader's high!
3,Does not fullfil its promise...,"This book starts off really promising, interesting and off-beat. But half way into the story it looses its zest. Too many complicated characters that are not fully explored show up. Too many story lines and issues that never get addressed fully. The last part of the book becomes quite boring and disoriented. It is a great story but I think the author was too ambituous in its scope and therefore ended up with many half-told stories. The only story that comes to somewhat of a closure was that of Agens/Father Damien. The rest of the characters remain in limbo. It was a dissappointing read after such a great start. I had a hard time keeping up the interest to finish it up."
5,One of the best books I've read this year,"Although I have long been an Erdrich fan, I have to say that this book stands alone as one of the most beautifully written novels I have read in a long time. From a bear baptism to an ugly Virgin Mary to a death by flatulence, this book is alternately funny and poignant.Louis Erdrich continues her tradition of intelligent, respectful and captivating writing with this book. Rather than elaborate on the specifics of characters and background in this novel, I will just say that this book gave me an overall sense of a writer who has found peace and come to appreciate life's joys."
5,Beautiful character study,This book will stay with me for a long time--the characters are diverse and yet all connected. The merging of Christianity and traditional Native American beliefs is lovely.
4,Very Interesting,"The first Erdrich for me, and it was actually very enjoyable. I will most certainly sample another of her novels."
3,My Opinion,Didn't care for the story. The Round House was much better. I love the way Ms. Erdrich writes however and would read her other books.
2,A little more action,"...and a little less intricacy would make this a much more worthwhile read. The unsolved murder is easily solved, the coincidental events too convenient and the secret identities force one to suspend disbelief. However Erdrich weaves some wonderful characters into the story line. I wanted to learn so much more about them. I yearned for their thoughts and feelings, especially during the third quarter of the book when it seemed that nothing eventful would ever happen and I was anxious to bring this novel to a close."
3,Struggled with this one,"I have read all of Louise Erdrich's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them and became involved with the characters. However, I labored with this book. Maybe it was too long, maybe the main character, Agnes, was too unbelievable. Erdrich gave her the voice of a wizened educated old man/woman. But her past indicates otherwise. And if you're Catholic, you will definitely have issues with this book. The story jumps around a lot leaving you desperate for her to tell a story, any story so that you can become deeply involved. I would recommend Love Medicine or Beet Queen if you are new to Ms. Erdrich."
3,ho hum,"Unbelievable story with very effective, if often disturbing, imagery. Very choppy. Quite dark.I would only recommend this if you really had lots of time on your hands and nothing better to do."
2,A Confusing and Boring Read,"This book was off to a good start, but quickly lost my attention and interest. The main character, a former nun, meets tragedy after tragedy, and eventually assumes the identity of a young priest, sent to spread God's word to the residents of an Indian reservation. She is so obscure, as are many of the characters in this book, and was impossible to relate to. My mom and I both read the book, as did the eight dedicated readers in my book club, and out of the ten of us, three actually finished the novel. And even those who finished didn't like it because of its confusing storyline and bizarre characters. I made it to page 100 before I threw in the towel and moved onto a different novel."
3,good but...,"I found this book to be good but also slightly flawed.I read it for a class (a University English class) and have been blown away by all the books so far but this one hasn't quite hit me the way some of the other novels I've read for the course did.It started out great, I was really intrigued, but then sometime after page 100 I lost interest and just wanted the book to finish so I could write my paper and be done with it.I really wish though that the book said somewhere on it that it is basically a part of a series. Until I came to the Amazon website and read a bunch of reviews I had no idea! Maybe reading more of her novels would have helped me get through the novel better in the first place!"
2,The Empress Has No Clothes,"In a few words: Boring. Overblown. Pretentious and unrealistic. Poorly written. Clumsy, clunky sentences.Give me a break! A few wonderful visual images do not redeem hundreds of underdeveloped characters, unfinished story lines, and poor editing, and chalking it up to ""circular Indian thinking"" is ridiculous.I give two, as opposed to one, stars due to the potential of a great story---ie, the author has imagination. Beyond that, I don't get the hype."
1,ONE WORD !!BORING!!,"I thought this movie was going to be a serious hardcore movie delving deep into the life of a prostitute.This movie barely scratches the surface of what these women go through on a daily bases.The movie wasn't even explicit sexually or really nudity wise,I'm sorry maybe my expectation were to high but for me this movie was boring as hell and didn't make sense.If you want to see a movie that truly puts you in the life & world of a prostitute and is very explicit violence,nudity,and sexually wise then you need to rent or buy the movie !BAISE MOI!"
3,Where's the theme song??!!,"After finding Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater on Netflix, my toddlers fell in love with it, especially the cute little theme song! I was happy to find this and other episodes for a low price. I pop it it, press play- no theme song! It goes straight into the episodes. I know it's not the biggest deal, but that song was so cute and catchy and my kids still sing it together."
1,Not age appropriate,"This DVD was given as a gift to our two-and-a-half year old daughter. Our daughter loves the Hello Kitty character and we, too, think it is very cute. But this DVD is definitely not for children under the age of 5. The stories are quite scary and a child at the age of our daughter cannot really distinguish between fiction and reality. The stories are rather for older kids but then the characters are not interesting for this age group anymore. So I think, there is no appropriate age group for this DVD. I cannot recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to buy it for kids. In fact, our DVD ended up in the trash."
4,popular with 2 year old,"sturdy, but a little boring on its own. baby doesn't always fit neatly into cradle but overall a sturdy, well-made toy"
2,editing needed,"My main impression of this book is that it would have made an excellent (long) magazine article or series. It seriously needed some editing to hit the highlights instead of going on and on with details. For instance, the whole storyline of the trees being razed for a parking lot, and the way the author could never fully understand it, was quite tedious. That being said, I did read an advance copy of the book, so it may have improved before publication. (I still think it would have been better as an article)This book does provide a great peek into an ordinary life, and I've come away with a different view of certain aspects of Japan. I was surprised to learn of how the teenagers fight with their parents, and dismayed to see how much time the Japanese man spends at work instead of with his family (or anything else, for that matter)."
1,"Enjoyable, but not nearly intelligent","This book about Japanese society is written from the point of view of an American. It is highly readable and enjoyable, but here and there are typical American's biases. If you want to know why American's way of living is different from Japanese's, this is the book for you. If you want to know why Japanese's way of living is different from Americans, look for a more intelligent book."
4,A great look at the grass-roots...,"The best books about other cultures are those that start at the bottom and work up. In this book Elisabeth Bumiller interviews a Japanese women and her family, friends and others linked to the family to give a very detailed picture of a Japanese family from 1991 to 1992. We get to join festivals, sit in at PTA meetings, visit mobsters, learn about local politics, find out what family issues the Japanese have and even the family's view on America and international events.NOTE: The author has very strong views of her own and will state them, but don't let that get in the way of the rest of the book. She digs up a LOT of information and makes it clear that while the Japanese might have different ways of thinking or doing stuff, they do have some of the same goals, dreams and fears."
3,A Quality Read,"Like many African American women, I haven't had many intimate contact with women of Asian ancestry so I was really excited about this book when I found it at the local college library. The author does a fantastic job of observation into the life of a ""typical"" Japanese housewife. The book gave me a deeper understanding of one aspect of Asian culture that I couldn't have learned otherwise. At times, the reading lags a bit because of its ordinary-ness but at the same time it is the ordinary day to day struggles that Mariko encounters that makes the work so engaging. I recommend it highly to anyone that is willing to spend a day reflecting on something other than themself."
5,The Best feeling and fitting,"I wore these skiing in Switzerland, kept me super warm. I purchased the medium (I am 5'4, 127 lbs), they fit perfectly. I don't like them too tight."
5,Love these!,"Love these! The material is quite thick and not see-through at all, yet they are VERY stretchy and form-fitting! I bought them with the intention of using them as warm underwear only, but because of the quality of the material I've had no problem wearing them as casual pants on warmer days. I have big legs and a small waist, and oftentimes leggings are too loose in the waist and tend to slide down as I exercise; these stay put! I'm ordering more of these."
4,Hot Chilly's,"Good product. They keep my wife warm, worth the money. However I do not like being told how many words I have to put in a review."
3,Good But Not Great,"Just thought it was an average mystery. Very little romance. I'm not going to write a plot summary since so many on Amazon have already did that. I had problems getting into the characters. I just felt like she didn't truly explore them and get you to feel what they were feeling. I enjoyed some of the plot twists but one of the reviews here had kinda ruined it for me, but it was also easy to figure out. I liked the premise of the radio talk show psychologist host. I was hoping that Ms. Kane would go into that area more to heighten the mystery thriller part of the book. As for romance, there wasn't any build up to that and you didn't feel their instanteous attraction either. Just wasn't believable. I will definitely try another one of her books just because of her plot premise. Don't want to buy this book. This is strictly a library checkout book."
2,"Excess drama, little meaning","Insert favorite cliche about sound and fury signifying nothing here. Kane's book is talky like a soap opera, has idealized but unrealistic characters, and plenty of sex appeal but little in the way of an actual mystery. In fact, this particular book is evident from the first two chapters; its conclusion surprises no one who was attentive. Language is bare, tepid. She sells millions of books. That this seems to be in contradiction with the quality of the book is a paradox I have learned to tolerate."
2,2.5 stars Not her best...,"I had a really hard time getting into this one. And that really stinks since I had it on back order for so long. For some reason, I just couldn't get into it, or get a good feel for the characters. It seemed really boilerplate in places. And frankly, the ending was really obvious. I mean, it's been done before (like just about everything else out there). I finally skipped a good chunk of the front and moved on and was able to read the mid section. Then, when it dropped off again, I just skipped to the back. (I did go back and read those skipped sections to make sure I didn't miss anything. It was like returning to a soap opera after two years to find the exact same plot line.) Trite and obvious prose in places, this is a story that has potential but falls short of what I expect from this normally fantastic author. (sorry Miss Kane!!)"
4,Suspenseful and Easy read,"I really liked this book. I am a fan of Andrea Kane and I was thrilled when she began writing in this genre. This book moved quickly. As other readers have said, if you are reading carefully, you can probably figure out the plot. Even though, I still liked the pace of the book. The characters are deep, and you can easily relate to them.Good read. I can't wait for more!!"
2,Too predictible and unlikeable characters,"I read this entire book, but only because I didn't have anything else to read. It's the kind of book you could put down at any point and not miss the characters or wonder what happened to them. You know what happens to them and who did it to them almost from the very beginning. AND, you didn't really care what happened to them because they weren't likeable and you felt no sympathy.I see this author gets good reviews on many of her books, so I might try another. But I wouldn't buy it."
3,Predictable,"While the book was suspenseful enough to keep you interested, it was extremely predictable. The culprit's identity was easy to figure out early on, and the ending of the book explaining everything went on way too long.I also really didn't care too much for Taylor or Reed...their romance seemed forced and unrealistic. And I particularly hated the happily-ever-after epilogue -- it drives me nuts when an author puts a whole slew of unknown characters into a scene and overpowers you with dialogue where every single character must have a say or a role."
3,"3.5 Stars, but not quite 4","It was a little ""out there"", you really have to suspend your disbelief. Very cute and fairly different setting, in the music world.The side characters just got to be too much for me. I did not feel as if they focused enough on Kylie and David, Ms. Brandt was trying to get side stories going, and that part just did not work for me. She kept introducing different characters, and a couple you could never see the purpose of brining in to the story line, but overall very enjoyable.Kylie is an adorable doofus, and David is a tight, I can't love anyone, because of my awful childhood type. Kylie loosens him up. Fun read, especially if you skim the extra parts, (you will see what I mean). Maybe get this one at the used store though."
5,Very nice sheets,My son loved his new sheet set and loves his bedroom now because of his Scooby Doo bedding.
1,Boring!,"Whoever said there is no such thing as a grumpy ukulele player hasn't seen this one. The instructor looks and sounds like a mathematics professor. His ""lecture"" is on music theory and how to read music. He could really be talking about almost any stringed instrument. Give this one a miss."
2,Where's the Funk?,"To be honest, I only bought this recording to hear more of obscure organist Jymm Joachim Young who was so outstanding on Steve Miller's song Fly Like An Eagle. On Boz Scaggs Band his (and everyone else's) talent is wasted. None of these songs are memorable (and I've listened to this CD about ten times). So called standout tracks like Monkey Time and Runnin' Blue have great titles but are ultimately forgettable.Perhaps this would be a good keepsake for those who saw Boz Scaggs in the late sixties or early seventies. For the rest of us, the question comes to mind: where's the funk?[DW]"
3,Math,"This seems to be ok. It hits the basics of math. I haven't had much time to use this yet, but as far as what I saw it looks ok."
4,"good, but not warp good","this is a good album , but it lacks something that the rest of the savath & savalas releases have, maybe because its on anti instead of warp, maybe because Eva Puyuelo Muns isnt on the album. every warp release has had a certain signature sound, this release seems to wander more into Scotts heritage roots sound and has less or no glitch beats. i really like the album, but listeners who lean more towards the apropa't, rolls + waves e.p., and manana e.p., or Scotts prefuse/delarosa + asora sound, might wanna take a listen before purchasing. very nice and relaxing as always though."
5,Very good value and performance!,This center channel speaker has a very crafted high quality appearance. I took the grill off and was impressed by the speakers themselves. I never realized how important a center channel speaker really is. I invested most of my money in the front and surround. I hooked this speaker up and it really filled the void you feel when there is not much activity from the other speakers when you hear dialog from movies. I thought they had good high and mid range. The voices and other center channel output sounded rich and strong. The 6 1/2 inch woofers are better than I thought they would be based on some other reviews I read.
