4,Totally worth your money,"A must have for all you clubbers, sure reminds me of my clubbing days. If you like DJ Sammy, Alice Deejay, Fragma, Lasco, etc........you won't be dissapointed."
5,A very worthy purchase. You will not be disappointed.,"This is by far one of the best CD's ive bought in a while I have purchased many cds in hopes of the rest of the cd being as good as the single hit you'd hear on a radio. While many would leave me disappointed, I certainly have not been in this case.They are more commonly know for their songs ""Walking in the sky"" and ""I see right through to you"". While most cd's usually only come with one chart topper this one comes with two leading me to believe this was a worthy purchase. The rest of the CD has a great complilation of songs written with contemporary dance rythms and slower paced music, offering a nice mix of tunes.Overall, ive been very happy with the disc in its entirety and its definately going to be a keeper for some time to come. I'd highly recommend this cd if you're interested in artists such as dj sammy and kylie minogue"
1,1 star for a good song,"this album is not the worst ive heard but it could have been better!!!!! i love the song ""i see right through you"" but then it just falls off!!! sory no encore"
4,Fun and funky and in English!,"This is probably not a ""seminal"" work like Moebius and Plank's other effort ""Rastakraut Pasta"", or Moebius, Plank and Neumeier's ""Zero Set"", but it should indeed be essential to anyone who has interest in the German electronic scene. If only for the fact that it had such a long shelf life and it features the great Conny Plank, who is no longer with us. I'm happy to hear it done in English and ""Taras Bulba"" is a mightly slab of industrial-quirky-electro-metal greatness. As only Moebius and Plank can serve up. I would probably give this a 3 1/2, but 3 don't cut it. Don't miss this one before it is gone."
1,Read the product description!,"The title of this product is misleading. ""The Joy of Painting Series"" is not hours and hours of Bob Ross episodes; this is only 9 instructional episodes for an exorbitant price. I'd like the whole SERIES of the show; not a select collection."
4,DVD's good but the case was cracked-hence the 4 star,"I love Bob Ross paintings; so I was very happy to see them. BUT, I received a case that was broken in the lower back part and the front cover plastic and paper had a small slit in it. Plus, it was not sealed like they do in the stores, so I am not sure if it is a used product. I know it isn't suppose to be; it is suppose to be brand new and factory sealed. I have contacted the seller through Amazon and will let you know how I make out. These DVD's are good so I plan on keeping them."
5,Simple and Relaxing,This DVD set taught me many of the basics of oil painting in the wet on wet style. I would recommend this set to anyone interested in oil painting in this style.
5,Fantastic Offering of Painting Techniques,"I could'nt ask for a more detailed and complete how to paint product than this has offered me. I relish the opportunity to hopefully become a master, at least in my own mind, when it comes to painting."
4,Fabulous series on painting,Love watching this on CDs. Convenient to us when we want to watch rather than waiting for re-runs on TV.
1,NOT PRODUCT ADVERTISED,"This DVD set is not actually the Joy of Painting series. It is a set of instructional videos. The actual series is a different item, not to mention MUCH longer. HEADS UP."
5,"Oh dad, you had such talent","Everyone knows that Bob Ross is a talented artist, as evidenced in this multi-disc series. Few people knew he was a member of the high court of aliens. But no matter his unearthly origin, the fella could paint. My favorite episodes are the ones where he paints Alaska-type scenery, and I also like the episodes where is squirrel friend sits on the easel. His earthly presence will be missed but Bob continues to look over us from afar (along with Mrs. Garrett, Fry Daddy, and Tony Kronman)."
5,VFO,Needed it for the EFLITE VFO which uses 4 servos. Glad I found this so I could get my plane finished.
1,insane man trying to sound smart,"This book has proven to me, never judge a book. By the cover, by the reviews, or even by the first few pages. No judging. ""Tintagle at high morning shines as though carved from tusk"". A random sentence chosen from the book. This man is insane. ""A maid that bleets from indoors"" ""goat feathers"" How many goats have you seen with feathers? And whats all this about ""petal sized snowflakes"". Off of what flowers? I kept waiting for a King Arthur plot to show up, but the Merlin and Arthur type characters seem to be entirely different people. I think the guy tried way to hard adding in all of these religions, and nutso words, not to mention it back tracks constantly and is frequently inconsistant with just about everything. He needs to have his pen taken away and broken into tiny pieces. In other words I was very dissapointed."
1,Didn't like it at all!!,"I didn't even finish it, couldn't get any enthusiasm for it!! Finally gave up trying and admitted it wasn't for me!!"
5,Old Legends with a refreshing new view.,"This book uses old and much garbled Arthurian Legend as a basis for a bemusing and enthralling fantasy world. This book, however, is written mostly from the perspective of Merlin, the demon Lailoken incarnate. The magic represented in this novel is more plausible and seen as a natural thing which anyone can aspire to - thus creating a more believable storyline.This novel is very memorable in that it takes old legend and makes of them a wholly innovative and unprecedented idea (a godsend when so many writers are constrained by moth-eaten old works and their own imaginations)."
2,Mish-mosh,"I was really disappointed in this book and almost didn't finish it. The author tried to fit as many mythologies/ theologies/ histories/ etc. as possbile into one supposedly fantasy story. They all ran into each other in a way I did not find illuminating at all. Was it meant to teach a little bit about all these belief systems, or to tell a story?The only part of it that I liked was the story of the dragon and the unicorn, which was about 5% of the book. I thought that part was beautiful and would have much rathered the author expand that into the whole story instead of sticking onto ""Arthurian"" half-legend with as many religions as he can entangle."
1,Could not get into this book,I read less of this book than I have to write about it to get Amazon to publish my review.
3,Refreshing but strained,"A new and interesting combonation of several legends (Arthurian, Norse, Atlanian, etc.) with new ""legends."" All in all, I gave it 4 stars for its creativity, but the book does lack focus and was downgraded for trying to do too much with its storyline. The characterization is a little weak as well. It's one of the few series that I haven't been interested in continuing, but I'm not sorry I read this one."
1,doomed butterflies with lightning burned dream stars,"This book has proven to me, never judge a book. By the cover, by the reviews, or even by the first few pages. No judging. ""Tintagle at high morning shines as though carved from tusk"". A random sentence chosen from the book. This man is insane. ""A maid that bleets from indoors"" ""goat feathers"" How many goats have you seen with feathers? And whats all this about ""petal sized snowflakes"". Off of what flowers? I kept waiting for a King Arthur plot to show up, but the Merlin and Arthur type characters seem to be entirely different people. I think the guy tried way to hard adding in all of these religions, and nutso words, not to mention it back tracks constantly and is frequently inconsistant with just about everything. He needs to have his pen taken away and broken into tiny pieces. In other words I was very dissapointed."
1,The book is got too much going on.,"The reason I chose this book is because I love fantasy and science fiction. I also collect unicorns, so when I saw the cover I was immediately drawn to the book. I have to say that I got through about 30 pages before giving up. It had too much going on and was written in hard to understand words. I had to keep refering to the dictionary. I am by no means illiterate. I have a BA degree with a minor in English. The author needs to choose words that are less complicated. It made me feel uneducated. If it was written in easier to understand words, I probably would have loved it. I don't understand why everyone else gave it a good review. It was a total waste of my hard earned money."
1,did not even finish it,"after about 50 pages, I just quit. did not like the writers style, and was very boring. maybe I should have given more time but........"
2,A Confusing Book,I still do not understand the beginning of the book. The author gives a lot of information but it seems to be random and utterly confusing. Later on the story becomes somewhat clear but it is not a great story and it is not that well told. The author probably had a good idea but needed a better editor.
2,A New Twist,"I liked the concept, but the book just did not engage me like some other Arthurian tales have. The author did hit on many interesting mythological and historical points, which I liked. Meybe I will finish it some day but this is one of 2 books I've put down without finishing because it just didn't pull me in deeply enough."
3,the dragon & the unicorn,"I found that the story line became confusing and difficult to follow. Also after trying to complete reading the book, it became boring, but I am still working on reading it to the end."
4,The Dragon & Unicorn,I liked this book but I believe it was just a little dragged out. There were some some places where it seemed as parts of a sentence was left out or not completely erased and words were put in a sentence that were not supposed to be included.
4,Pretty good,"I must say that this book has been pretty good. I think the reason I enjoyed it was the fact that it had to do with Arthur and the Norse myths. I wouldn't reccomend reading it unless you didn't like either of those things or the Celtic myths. One of the most intriguing parts was figuring out who had similarities with the Norse gods. Quite obviously, the Furor is a young and brash Odin. All in all, I'd say this book was pretty danged good."
2,Poor Picture,"The picture looks really nice, but when you get it, you find that it is a piece of cardboard that has been laminated. Maybe I miss read the caption, but I thought it would be a nice solid checkers board."
3,Grandfather's Day: A Rreview By Tracy Wooten,"Nine year old Raydeen Grimley's grandfather moves into her house after the death of Raydeen's grandmother. Grandpa Grimley is depressed over the death of his wife and mostly stays in his room. Little Raydeen makes it her mission in life to ""fix Grandpa's broken heart."" As the story unfolds, the reader comes to realize that Grandpa stays away from Raydeen because she looks and acts so much like Grandma Grimley. This book is an easy read and Ingrid Tomey carefully examines the topics of death and depression. Through the eyes of a nine year old child, the reader experiences the grieving process. Ultimately, young Raydeen succeeds in winning the heart of Grandpa Grimley and the reader."
1,wouldn't recommend.....,very odd and awkward design and assembly with long threaded nut/spacers also holes for fixture didn't match up with holes in fixture had do quite a bit of altering. Not a happy customer with this product.
1,don't buy it,i bought this for my daughter's full size bedVery disappointedThe quilt has a very bad smell even after you wash it I think because it's made out of very cheap fabric.I tried to return it but it's going to cost me $15 for shipping.In the picture it shows 2 standard shams and 1 square pillow but it comes with only one sham for full/queen size and when I tried to convince them that full/ queen size comes with 2 standard shams they said that all the sizes comes with 1 shame and 1 square pillow even though their ad shows 2 shams and the box also said 2 shams they refuse to give extra one or pay for return.Don't waste your money
5,Adds to enlightenment of Hands on Healing,"Having been a healer for several years now, it has been pleasant to discover how well Linda Smith adds to the Judeo-Christian perspective to such basic remedies as healing touch. Her background, of course, enhances it, but her clarity and organization make this a valuable addition to a healing lib...or an intro to healing."
5,My calling too,"I have found my life's calling. Linda Smith is a nurse and I am too. She describes the wonderful work of healing with prayer, hands on touch and aromatherapy, bringing back traditions from Judeo-Christianity. What a wonderful combination. It's my desire to follow her lead. She is the director of the Institute for Spirituality and Aromatherapy. May she be blessed by her life's work."
4,Insider look at Washington,"My only regret is that I did not pay more attention to Katharine Graham and the Washington Post while she was alive. Through unveiling her own insecurities and illustrating how she moved into one of the most powerful women in the world, I learned US History and the trials of a CEO woman in the 1960s and forward.Ms. Graham reveals much about ""inside Washington"" and does a particularly good job of making the ""players"" come to life. I really hated to see the book end. Yet, Ms. Graham did what she set out to do -- documented a time in our history. Kathy Condon Executive Coach"
4,Great book,"Fantastic, gripping book, though it bogged down for me near the end with the minutia of labor/management disputes at the Washington Post. Still recommend highly."
3,Not deserving of the Pulitzer,"Pulitzer Prize? You've got to be kidding. This book is screaming for a good editor. She could have told her incredibly compelling story in half the words. I was looking forward to reading about a woman who overcame her blue-blooded background to become one of the most influential publishers of the 20th century. Instead I trudged through too many details that just didn't matter. I wished she would have spent far more time on Watergate and the Pentagon Papers. In those instances she showed real guts. I was disappointed that she gave too much credit to those around her. Though I'm sure they had much to do with it, ultimately she was responsible for making difficult decisions. I wanted her to just once say ""Look what I did!"""
2,Burn Up the Letters & Tell Your Story,"This book is huge. The highlights of K. Graham's life do seem interesting but there are too many insignificant stories in between. Because the author decides to include ALL the details of life, both personal and professional (as well as the personal and professional of those Graham is close to, the book drones on and on.) I found too much name dropping. Another main complaint is that it is written with so many documents quoted. Each page is a letter to/from Graham or someone else. There is so little story and so much ""he said"" ""she said"". I would have liked it better if she just burned up the letters and told her story. She was involved in interesting times, but let's face it, she was on the perifery. No book needs to be this long!"
1,Whitewash,".. a whitewash by one of the most ruthless power-brokers in the history of American publishing. One reviewer suggested that Mz Graham might be a good role model for girls. Really? I can't help but be reminded of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" in which General Franco is held out as the same. She was never interested in a free press and said as much in a speech at Langley in 1988. And if there was ever any doubt, consider her suppression of the biography authored by Deborah Davis (as difficult to find as another under-the-radar portrait of a demagogue, ""L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?"")."
3,"interesting background, but poor writing","The author had an interesting life and had the chances to meet interesting people and experienced important events, therefore, the book is worth reading. However, the way the author looked back her life was very superficial and not reflective. For all her possible mistakes, she gave the only excuse ""I didn't understand then.."", instead of thinking reflectively. I am amazed that there is no forgiving in her words towoard her mother, although her mother is dead for many years. Besides, the book is far too detailed and lengthy. Too more telling, too few narrating."
4,Inspirational read,"Katharine Graham's Personal History is an inspirational account of one woman's personal and professional development. Written in a very neutral tone, the book sheds light on the difficulties of being one of the first women in business. An inspiration for those of us trying to make our mark on the world today."
4,fascinating woman,"I was truly fascinated by Kay and the story of her life. She is a woman of a previous generation where a woman's place was to stand back and support her husband's goals and ideas. What an incredible burden was thrust on her when her husband committed suicide and she felt that she had to hold the paper together until her children (sons) could take over. Although she was a woman who had had a priviledged upbringing she had as much pluck as a woman, becoming a widow on the prairie in the 1800's, whose primary concern was holding together the family farm until it could be handed down to the children. I loved the antidotes she told of LBJ and saw him in a completely different light. He emerged as a likable, human figure. I'd like to read more about him now. Kay's life spans a long, diverse period of history and I wish my life included as many interesting people."
2,What a disappointment!,"What a disappointment this book was to me. I would have thought that someone with such an interesting life would have been able to write a more interesting book about it. I would have thought that a professional journalist would have been able to write a ""personal history"" with less whining."
1,A tediously long whitewash of a biased public life,"Kay Graham's prose style is acceptable enough, but shegoes on much much too long about her life, exceeding 600pages handily. It's tedious! Some of the episodes inacquiring different papers or in her marital life just aren'tworthy of such detailed remembrance.She is, understandably, silent on her paper's shameful record oftacking to one political party under her ownership, althoughshe seems willing to excoriate her dead husband, who can'tdefend himself, for some of the editorial decisions that HEmade. Like all autobiographies, this one is meant to make the writer look like a paragon. I'm not buying it."
2,A dissapointment from a great woman.,"While this book is interesting, it is also slightly artificial. Other female meditators, like Frida Kahl an Anne Truitt, have been far more successful."
2,An editor's nightmare,"Katharine Graham would have been well-served by an editor who had had the guts to chop 300+ pages from this opus. It is written in a somewhat whiny, defensive mode, as Graham, at 70, continues to blame her mother and husband for her continuing self-esteem issues. The book also reveals how little she did to make the Post empire a success, editorially or as a business. Really a disappointment all around."
4,Surprisingly Personal,"one of the most personal histories I have ever ran my eyes across... I read this book with the lights on. Too scary to read in the dark. But, I do recommened it to those who like books.I have to admit that is surprised me from time to time. Not a Steven King surprise, but more like a ""oh, that's helena bohnam carter under thet latex in planet of the apes"" kind of surprise.Finally, there is no doubt that this book tells the story of a remarkable, personal lady. If you read it you will know that too."
1,Should have been titled: The Life of a Corporate Cheerleader,"From what I understand in the news you won't see read by Peter Jennings or his ilk, this woman made a career of ruining a formerly liberal paper, crushing the printing press union and setting the tone for the hiring across picket lines that permeated throughout the eighties and nineties (see air traffic controllers and Ronald Reagan), and remained close buddies with those of dubious morality in government with the likes of Henry Kissinger (Pol Pot's pal), of which she should have been exposing as the war criminals they were. - If this is a story about how wealthy white women can rise to power in journalism using the same underhanded tactics and corporate interests as wealthy white men, well then I guess she deserves the credit of those wanting us to continue consuming with our heads held firmly in the sand. ""What a woman""? Indeed. It goes to show there is equality in preserving inequality after all."
2,An editor's nightmare,"Katharine Graham would have been well served by an editor willing to cut 300+ pages from this wordy autobiography. It has a disconcertingly whiny tone throughout, from Graham's airing her deeply-held resentments toward her mother (at age 70!) to her husband's mistreatment of her, although she admits to have been something of a doormat during the marriage. Most disturbing, however, is Graham's gradual revelation of her lack of involvement in the Post's editorial or business success--all while wringing her hands over her lack of business savvy. And this won the Pulitzer Prize?"
2,An author who is more interesting than her book,"I looked forward to reading this because I thought Katharine Graham has led an interesting live. The reviews were outstanding. After reading the book, I am of the opinion that the reviewers reviewed Katherine Graham's life, not her book. If ever a good editor was needed, it was during the first third of this book. I ended up where I began - interesting life. Can't wait for the biography. Ms. Graham did not bring herself to life. I could never picture her in her house or at the dinner table. I felt she kept us at something more than arm's length. And while she shared some very personal events, I never felt the emotional impact"
3,Impersonal personal history,"I thought I would be giving 5 stars for an award winning book but after reading, it just fell short. There was too much name-dropping, one has to be very familiar with the power scene of Washington at her time to really appreciate who was who and their significance. That itself made the book very unapproachable to readers who do not move in her circle, non-American, the younger generation etc. A lot of time she just mentioned the names and expected the readers to know who they were or connect to her earlier mentions (it would really be a pain to constantly check the index and refer back to the earlier pages!)This book read like an account of achievement of her father, her husband and herself. Honestly, Katharine came across as someone fairly stupid (though kind), I couldn't help to wonder if she was who she was simply because of her birth, marriage and being there at the right time. For a personal history, it came across as fairly impersonal."
5,Inspiring and gripping,"Katharine Graham did not presume she was the end all in this book, she took a humbel approach in telling her life's tale. There were boring, and sometimes Exaggerated parts. I especially found the women's movement chapter unintersting to me, on the other hand I could not let the book nor my emotional outburts down when she wrote about the pressmen's strike. Over all this is an excellent book, I wish I had read earlier (i.e. in her life time)."
4,Interesting Read,She was actually quite different that she seemed in real life! Read it to find out how. Well worth the price.
3,Interesting and a good read,I enjoyed this book but it seemed a little hard to relate to her family background.
3,This won the Pulitzer?,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good book and a good read, and Graham has an interesting take on some of the most important events & trends of 20th century history. But writing quality should be a key component of the Pulitzer, and the writing here is so uneven (and long--about 100/150 pages too long). Too much telling without showing, such as three dozen mentions of ""This stems from my insecurity"" and only four or five incidents demonstrating her insecurity; and far too many questions posed in the text, like ""Was I being unreasonable? I suppose that perhaps I was."" A good writer would ask the question implicitly, and answer it more gracefully. Pulitzer was awarded more for who she is than what she wrote. Still, it's worth a week or two of reading time."
2,Not that interesting,"I respect what Ms Graham achieved in her life, but she really could have told it in less than 600 pages. The book includes many minor details about unimportant events. Her repetitive declarations about the paper's impartiality get annoying pretty quickly.If you want to read about an important, powerful woman, go read Margaret Thatcher's Downing Street Years."
2,"Papa, Phil and Post - A Real Title","Katherine took this venue to mention every person she ever met for fear they read the book and didn't see their name. It made me laugh. I felt like I was reading a loose version of a history book and not really about a woman, mother, wife."
3,good read when you are down with a cold,"Having lived in the Washington area for almost 40 years, I found Katharine Graham's book interesting as a review of times past. What ultimately disappointed me was Katharine Graham herself. I understand the deep anxieties she felt on taking on tasks for which she had no training. Being the only woman in a man's world is rough. But I never see her triumphing this handicap in spite of all the opportunities she had. Instead she looks for replacements of her husband by relying on Ben Bradley and Warren Buffett, both strong and assertive personalities. She constantly depricates herself and thus never shows that she is a true leader. Obviously she put her paper at risk during the Watergate and Pentagon Papers episodes. But was it really her decision? I don't thinks so. A dutiful daughter is the epithet I would ascribe to Mrs. Graham, but not an inspiration for women."
2,Not what I expected,"I listened to this audio version for an upcoming book discussion. Somehow it just didn't work for me. Based upon all the wonderful remembrances and comments about Graham, I expected a fascinating, insightful story about one woman's journey from sheltered childhood, through a difficult loss and on into a rewarding, powerful role at the Post. I just didn't get it--it must be me. I found this shortened tape version to be a 'poor little rich girl's' tale of woes--some of which sounded like a lot of stiff-jawed whining. I still think there is much to be admired in Graham's eventual rise to a powerful position, but she just didn't tell me about it in a way I could relate to. And, rather than telling me about the political, Washington background behind some of those difficult decisions (Watergate, Pentagon papers), Graham summed those decisions up in a helpless sounding nutshell. Perhaps this was because I heard the abridged version?"
5,Works and my bird liked it!,"I bought this for my parakeet (a Budgie) because he had an impacted sour crop and was spitting up all his normal seeds and starting to lose weight. This product has lacobacillus (yogurt) cultures in it, plus a nice rich blend of seeds and grains, even defatted wheat germ and flax!My bird immediately started eating it and gained weight, she seemed to really like the taste and seed selection in it, even though it was for canaries and finches.The probiotics in it helped to get rid of the yeast infections (a lot of crop problems have this).This Avilac forumula doesn't have that ""medicinal"" smell or strong vitamin smell like some bird seed products have, which I apreciated ;).The bag was enough for about two weeks worth and worth every penny. My bird is now better after eating this for a week (and keeping her warm) and I can highly recommend this product."
5,Tori's review,"People in Pinnapple Place is one of those books that I just pulled off the shelf. There isn't many good books like that, but this was just one of them. It's about eight invisible people who only few people can see. The leader of the crews name is April. The little boy who had moved from Vermont to Washington can see them all and his mother can't. Neither can most people, so when he talks about them people think he is crazy. This is now my favorite book. Now what are you doing reading on the computer when you could be reading this book. Get off your bottom and read this book from cover to cover. Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!."
5,Best House CD ever Made!,"This CD is a great representation of the L.A. House scene back in the early to mid-90's. Tony B! was a prominent DJ in the Los Angeles club scene and co-founder of the popular, late-night mix show ""Power Tools"" which he hosted along side Richard Humpty Vission. Tony later went on to try and push a new station in the Southern California area along with legendary radio host and DJ Swedish Egil. If you are a fan of hard house and fast cut mixes, this may not be the CD for you. Tony's mixes are more methodical, incorporating the art of actually ""mixing"" where you will have two tracks over lapping for as long as 90 seconds, almost creating a new track in the process. The 2nd program is definitely more aggressive than the first, but if you're a true fan of house music, you will definitely enjoy this gem."
5,great music,"Great CD, with really good easy listening songs. Francesco at his best. Great service from the vendor, delivered really quickly."
5,Strozzi - Cantates / Susanne Ryden,"Strozzi - Cantates / Susanne Ryden is a 2000 Harmonia Mundi recording played by the Musicas Fiorita and starring soprano Susanne Rydén. Andreas Wernli has written the music notes. English translation by Howard Weiner. I am extra proud of Sussane Rydén's performance being that I am a fellow Swede. Included in the booklet are short biographies of the ensemble and Ms Rydén. The lyrics are available in Italian, French, English and German. Highly recommended. 5/5."
2,I now know why I never knew about this Hopkins movie,Arghh! This is so slow moving and the dramatic music really gets annoying. The idea held really good promise but was so boring.
5,Best elementary book teaching multiplication,"My mother used this book, I've used this book. Students find it very easy to follow the examples and each lesson builds upon the next. Someone stole my multiplication copy of the series. If you have the book, email me, I'd be interested in purchasing a copy for my students: timothy-dot-burton (at) gmail (dot) com"
3,For the price why not buy it,I have three toddlers so this was a must have item for my mini van. Not the best product but it is still in one piece. Edges curled within two days but not a total deal breaker for me. At this price it's a functional disposable item.
3,Was Expecting Better,These seat covers are fairly flimsy but for the price that is ok. I installed them on the back side of the drivers and passenger seats in my VW Van. The bottom of the covers don't properly attach to anything so the sides fold inward. I would not buy them again.
5,"Clear, strong protector","My kid love to kick the back of front seat. This one does the job. Thick enough to be beaten by kick, smooth enough to repel the dirt and easy clean, clear enough to see what's in the pouch on the back of the seat. Great product. I have it for about six months and still clear."
3,it is not a perfect fit.,Maybe it is not for Lexus gx470. It kind of crumbles on top and has gaps from the sides. The feet part is great. My kids are not going to destroy the bottom of the seats during the winter.
1,Cheap design cover ripped,Kicking the cover is what it should be designed for... my five year old managed to kick it enough to rip the black attachment strings off...so I am off looking for a new one.
1,Not worth your money,This is not worth your money you cannot tie the ends down. You can only strap around the headrest in newer cars.
3,o.k,"They are ok. They don't quite fit my honda odyssey like i expected them to and they could be a little bigger, but they'll do"
1,Even cheaper than I thought they would be,"We purchased these seat covers for our minivan. I did not have high expectations for the price, but I was still disappointed. One of the covers ripped while it was being installed and was rendered completely useless. The other also ripped but we were able to leave it there to protect against our youngest wiping his feet on the back of my seat. I would not recommend these; and if I had it to do again I would have spent a few more dollars for something that (hopefully) would not tear during installation."
1,Doesn't work!,"The bottom of these seat back protectors stay fastened with velcro sticky things. Well, the tape on the stickers are not sticky enough. I drive a bmw with plastic seat backs and they do not stick to the plastic at all leaving the bottom portion of this item useless and unsecured. I would definitely not repurchase! I threw both of them out (I thought maybe just one of them was bad, but both sets of sticky's were simply not sticky enough!)"
1,Poorly Constructed,"We bought these for our middle row in the van, since we recently moved our Kindergartner to the back seat. We took a road trip and I sat back there with him. The vinyl was a nasty feeling on my bare leg against the back of the middle row seat-it was sticky and made me sweaty. My 5-year-old kicked at it the whole trip and just before we got home, he said he didn't like them, pulled on the top of it and the stitching to the laces that hold it to the headrest just ripped right out.I would not buy these again.We have some gray, fabric seat protectors that we purchased at Wal-mart a couple of years ago, made by Fisher Price, but cannot find those anymore. I wish we had had the foresight to buy a second set back then."
3,Okay.,"These are all right and are true to the description. The main problems are that they don't stay up very well (can get kicked off by kid), and that they don't cover the sides of the seat, so if your child sits in the middle, the sides of both front seats are still vulnerable to dirty feet. They were easy to ""install,"" though."
4,Good buy,It's good buy and really protects your seat especially with toddlers.You will not disappointed with this buy. I recommend it.
3,it serves the purpose,it was brought to protect the back side of the front seat and it does its job. i am fine with this product.
3,good protector,"My children like it very much. And, I am thinking to buy one more for my second daughter.Try to use it."
1,Very Poor Workmanship,"This product was on the back of the driver's seat for less than 2 minutes before the child in the carseat put her feet on the protector and it ripped off. The whole elastic tie totally ripped off. When I checked it, there were only two stitches holding the elastic ties to the plastic. The construction was shoddy and the plastic is very poor quality. I am not going to puchase this particular item ever again."
1,disappointed,"Very disappointed. After a week, the sides started to fan out away from the seat no matter how tight the straps are. Would NEVER buy this product again and actually in search for another one that works."
4,Simple and useful,"Simple but useful, just right, easy to install and clean.this product is nice and easy to use.Just what I needed."
3,Curls up at the top,Would recommend they are more rigid at the sides so as not to curl up at the corners and expose the seat back.
2,Doesn't fit all cars!!!,"Great concept but not well thought out... NOT all cars have a head rest... and a head rest is REQUIRED to attach the top part... if the inventors of this were really ingenious they would have thought of a way that it could attach to all seats, including those that do not have head rests, but is just one solid seat (like in a ford explorer/expedition/etc...). I wasted my money on this!!!"
3,Auto seat back protector,"The price was right, but this did not work for our 2012 Toyota Camry hybrid. I still have hope for my Honda CRV, but have not yet tried it. The issue is more with not fitting the Camry than anything else with a rear-facing child. Since the car does not have rear movable headrests, this product needs to tie into the latches in the rear window ledge; however, it shifts around and the ties are not long enough to position it correctly. As a result of this, the bottom of the protector does not reach below the level of the carseat, so my daughter gets her feet under it and starts kicking it everywhere, thus defeating the purpose."
1,Thin plastic does not hold up to summer heat,"The straps on the top of these do not keep the top corners from falling forward, exposing a lot of the top of the seat. This is very evident when it is hot out. The material is just a thin plastic so any heat makes it very flexible."
3,"Good Book, Priced Way Too High","This book is a good resource in terms of how it is designed, and how it sources out different resources for research purposes. I use it a lot when it comes to preliminary research on a given topic in medieval military history. But, the downside to the book mostly comes from its price. I have to go to the library every time I need it because it is way too expensive for me to buy (even used). It is frustrating because the book is not that big, and it only gives basic bibliographical information on a somewhat confined topic. Thus, it gets three stars; it gives the information it needs to concerning the title and what most readers will expect, but it really should not cost over $100 dollars. Hopefully the professors/authors who write these types of overpriced books will someday realize that they will reach out much more to a broader range of people if they only make their books affordable!!! Appealing to a larger crowd SHOULD be the goal of all authors and teachers!!!"
1,"Retractable, yes, compact, no","I purchased this item thinking it would be a space-saver in my crowded makeup bag and for travel--to me, that's the whole point of having a retractable brush! Sadly, this brush is about the same size as the brush I was already using which is not retractable. The design could be improved to make this a lot more compact while still being easy to use. The brush is also difficult to open and retract will not stay open during use--very cheaply made. Knowing what I do now, I would not buy it."
3,Over the Top,"This was an interesting book but not particularly what I was looking for. I was looking for a book about riding technique to improve my efficiency. With the exception of a few paragraphs here and there, this book went deep into design physics of components, etc., etc. It would be great if you were into research and development of cycling compenents. However interesting it may have been, almost every chapter ended with a phrase that went something like this, ""The research is inconclusive because of...."""
5,Great CD from some European jazz artists,A great CD of European jazz artists with a little help from some Americans. Great CD!!!!
4,New York Dolls - 'I'm A Human Being' (Receiver),"This fifteen track live compilation,had apparently come from two different shows.With one reportedly being a Vancouver '74 shindig.'I'm A...' is one of the BETTER sounding archive live Dolls recordings.Two covers I felt they did rather well were Willie Dixon's ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" and the Beatle's ""Dizzy Miss Lizzie"".Of course the Doll's original material here smokes as well,like ""Personality Crisis"",""Babylon"",""Jet Boy"" among others.Good mid-'70's proto punk to thoroughly enjoy here."
3,It was ok,"I generally enjoy novels by this author but this one disappointed. I thought the heroine to be too much of a shrew and the sister to be clingy. The hero is a good guy with an abundance of patience to put up with the antics of the sisters. This story was laden with too much prose but if you could get through it, it was ok. Not her best work just ok."
1,The worst book ever read,"This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. If I could give it a minus 5 star, that would even be too good!!! The plot is a mess--characters show up with little or no reason and the ending is vague at best. I thought the hero and heroine were two of the most obnoxious characters ever--they deserved each other! This book is a huge disappointment from this authour--I hope to God there won't be a sequel with the other twin. I certainly won't be buying it!"
1,"New Book was not ""new""","I purchased the following from this vendor at an expensive price:The Life of Jesus in Masterpieces of Art (Viking Kestrel picture books)Sold by: vana11Condition: newQuantity: 1$62.89 eachItem subtotal: $62.89When the book arrived, I noticed the corners were crushed and there was a lengthy, hand-written inscription inside the front cover. The book was not new. I will have to return it. My daughter will be disappointed. This was on her Christmas list."
4,He isn't my favorite..,"I don't listen to him all the time, but I do like this CD. The song, ""Whiskey Lullaby"" I can't even explain. I love it. I also love ""Celebrity"" because its really catchy. ""Little Moments"" is another good song on this CD. This isn't my favorite CD, and it probably never will be I just find it good. It doesn't get old. Of course, I'd rather listen to Gary Allan, Keith Urban, Dierks Bently, KENNY CHESNEY, etc. But I do listen to him alot as well. This is a good CD, which I do recommend overall."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"i really like brad paisley, dont get me wrong,, but you can sure tell the songs he wrote on this album and the ones the professionals wrote, he needs to clean up his lyrics,, his writing is way too wordy, the songs comes off as 'hooky',, compare his music to the smooth lyrics of alan jackson or george strait and you'll see what i mean,, i would have rathered have 12 good songs than to have to listen to his pet projects,, when i buy a cd i want to not have to flip the next button halfway through a song,,"
5,I'm mad about Brad,"Brad's the type of artist that transcends just being a country star. His appeal is crossover and genius. However, I'd like to hear a little more Brad and less band in the mix."
5,Another Great Album!,"Brad Paisley has done it again! I am a huge Paisley fan because of his more humorous songs, but this album is much more serious. While he does have one hilarious song (Celebrity), this album is filled with amazing songs that are much more heart-felt. I loved the three of them that made it onto the radio: Whiskey Lullaby, Mud On The Tires, and Little Moments. This guy seems to have four amazing hits on every record, but you will love the songs that never made it onto the radio as well!Enjoy!"
5,GreatGuyGreatSong,"""Mud On the Tires"" would be a nice Chevy Truck AD,like its a great song.I love the way it starts out slow,then Brad lets it all out.Brad Paisley is from my neck of the woods,and he always does wonderfull things for the community,like helping the flood victims,and so many other things.I'm not even a country music fan,but I am a Brad Paisley one."
5,Brad's the best!,"The only bad thing is that there wasn't more of Allison Krause with Brad! I look forward to hearing them team up in the future. Brad's great sense of humor shines on ""Celebrity"" and the whole CD is a great listen. Enjoy!"
2,Not Brad's Best,"Well if three times is a charm for Brad didn't get a third charm. In my opinion, this was Brad's weakest album of the two previously released albums. His first album being his best, second album running a close second, and his third album well you guessed it, finishes last. If you expect this CD to compare to ""Who Needs Pictures"" and ""Part II"" you might be disappointed a little."
5,Mud On the Tires,"Brad Paisley is a genius with his lyrics and of course the music is great. He is very insightful and great at poking fun at things we see and hear about every day, as well as lovely sentimental songs. I love the CD and I ordered ""Time Well Wasted""."
5,The Best Country Album This Year!,"Mud on the Tires has to be the best album this year. Every song is well thought out and perfectly performed. Brad Pasley shows that he is now one of the biggest acts in country. It's a must have for any country fan. It goes best in your car, but can be enjoyed anywhere."
4,More than solid effort,"As someone said earlier, Brad Paisley was my transition to country music. Great stuff, I love Brad's sense of humor found in his songs. And their catchy, too. On this album in particular, Mud on the tires is a solid opener. Famous People is also one of my favorites. Celabrity is a bit to poppy for me but the video is pretty funny. Whiskey Lullaby with Allison Krauss is heart wrenching and sweet. These are my two favorite counrty artists, so this song is a dream come true for me. ""Is it raining at your house"" is kinda slow but I really like this one as well. ""Little Moments"" is a great song as well that everyone can relate to, like most of Brad's songs. The Cigar Song is the only one I really don't like but with out a doubt this is worth picking up. Also try ""Part II"", my favorite BP album."
4,sweet and funny,"Usually I buy a cd for 2 or 3 songs that have become hits on the waves. I was pleasantly surprised to hear more on this album than what has hit the radio stations, and it is all great. With few exceptions (I am not a big fan of the talking western, so the ""Spaghetti Western"" at the end leaves me kind of cold) I enjoyed the whole album. Whether the rest of his stuff hits the charts or not, I will still love the cd, and that's something I haven't been able to say since Garth Brooks."
5,I will never again say never...,"First off I never thought I would ever own a country artist's CD. That said, I was flipping the channels one day and there was my first sighting of Brad in the ""Celebrity"" video. Cute video and cute guy as well. Some time later another Brad video...I think it was ""Little Moments"" aired and again I was hooked. Yeah, there is such a thing as cross-over music and this guy was definitely not playing what I considered typical country style music. This is a GREAT CD and a very talented artist. Great vocals, incredible guitar playing, nice songs, and yeah I think I already mentioned about him being cute. Ha!So if this soft rock fan can be won over than others will be too. You've made a fan out of me Brad! Already looking forward to your next CD and hey how 'bout a DVD release???"
2,It's ok,"This book is very repetitive, it has a long intro, and keeps saying things over and over. not liking it as much as I thought I would, doesn't grab me. Just a blah book."
1,"poorly titled-should read ""MAKING A COLLECTIBLE STEIN""","THERE WAS NO ON-LINE INFO ABOUT THIS BOOK ON AMAZON. THE TITLE LED ME TO BELIEVE THIS WAS A BOOK ABOUT MANUFACTURED COLLECTIBLE STEINS. INSTEAD, IT WAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE 11 DIFFERENT STEINS. HOW COLLECTIBLE THEY MIGHT BE IS UP FOR DISCUSSION. I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU FROM MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE."
2,Rambling,"This is supposed to be an autobiography by Sidney Omarr. The style is very rambling and much of the book is a tirade against those who don't believe in astrology. There is not much of substance here for the astrologer. The book could have used a good editor. Much is repetitious. Many ""facts"" are inaccurate (such as saying that Morinus was a Catholic Bishop or that with the Sun in Aquarius, the Full Moon will be in Libra). The book is mildly interesting since Sydney Omarr played a role in popularizing astrology in the last century. His comments on number symbolism appeared inaccurate and did not describe the people I tried applying them to. It's light and quick reading. If you're interested, it's probably best to borrow this from the library. It's not a book you would ever refer to again."
1,confessions of ....,"If you are looking for useful astrological information don't buy this book!! It is the first time I have read a book that I immediately wanted to throw away. Maybe I should have paid more attention to the title it really is as tacky as it sounds. sorry Mr Omar, maybe I had the wrong expectation, i was really disappointed as the last book i read of yours was a great resource - this is really just a brag."
2,Get a good paintbrush.,"I purchased this item at Lowes, thinking it would save time to edge the ceilings. I've painted professionally in the past and know how time consuming it is to edge. It has some pros and cons, but generally, I don't believe this item is worth it. It definitely will save time in edging. However, it doesn't make the cut at between the ceiling and the wall. It will paint 1/8"" on the ceiling or trim, because of how the bristles are designed. There is no real way around this. If you don't mind having an even cut edge on your ceiling, then this product may be fine for you. However, after using it on (3) bedrooms, (2) bathrooms, and a hallway, it's not worth it. I just had to go back the old fashion way with a paintbrush. Just buy a good quality chisel-edge paintbrush (Purdy) and practice a little."
5,Great Tool at a Reasonable Price,"This cut my painting time by at least a third. I never thought such a small, cheap tool would be so valuable. While you can apply paint to the edger with a brush for detailed areas, I found that useful in only a few areas. I got the best results by allowing the edger to lay face down in the paint for 5-10 seconds so it fully absorbs the paint, then wipe off the excess - you'll be able to apply a very long line of paint to your walls and get through your project much faster. I used it for ceiling edges, corners, trim, and baseboards with no problems."
1,Awful Design,"While it looks like it will do the job great, there is one big flaw in this product. At the top there is two little wheels designed to help roll long your surface easily. One problem is if you are trying to roll along a wall with the wheels on a ceiling with a popcorn coating, forget it.In addition, each time you dip it in paint be careful it doesn't go in too far. It's easily to get paint on the wheels and then you have tracks going along the surface that you don't want painted to begin with.Do yourself a favor. Save the $5, invest in a good brush and take the time to tape and paint. You'll end up having to do it regardless after 3 minutes using this product and realizing you wouldn't use it if someone paid you to use it."
1,Not as advertised!,"I saw this product in a hardware store and thought it would be a real time saver in edging a room that I was painting. When I got home, firt I had to break into the package. Does the company think someone is going to ""tamper"" with a fancy paintbrush? After I destroyed the packaging to get the product out I attempted to do as the instructions said. Luckily I had read them before destroying the package to remove the product. The problem started immediately when I raised the guides as the instructions had said to do, floated the pad in a layer of paint, and then tried to remove the edger with the pad still intact. The pad kept coming off and stuck to the paint in the tray. The the handle kept turning when I didn't want it to. This product is terrible! It ended up costing me more time than saving. Ended up using just a standard edger which did a much better job. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk. Great idea, bad product."
5,Definite Learning Curve,"I do not paint on a regular basis, hardly ever. I bought this because of the amazing reviews.After using it the first day, I was very frustrated. I couldn't figure out why people liked it so much. I couldn't understand how they could even use it. I was ready to give up.The second day, I decided to try again and realized that I had my pad in upside down, which was causing it to not lock in place and the pad was sliding. After I realized what I was doing, I too love this little device very much.You will need to have a handle for it, but they are very cheap. I also recommend buying many pads because they do not wash up well (luckily they hold up well while painting, I'm just saying I needed to toss them at the end of the day and didn't switch colors).I'm glad I got it, but wish I would have taken to heart other reviews that said to practice."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"So I rolled a 14x12 room going up just high enough to almost touch the ceiling. I planned on using one of those terrible foam brushes and spend about an hour doing the final edging as I had done in the kitchen. My dad has one of these ""shur-line 500"" edgers thrown in a bucket in his shop and said he didn't like it but I could give it a shot.I edged the whole room in less than 10 minutes. It absolutely blew me away. I am ordering one for myself with some replacement pads. If you put too much paint on it I can see why you would hate it. You just have to be patient and only dab enough on to ""wet"" the pad, then do one swipe back and forth and you're done. Don't get paint on the rollers or you will get a line drawn on the ceiling. Be careful and patient and it will save you so much time."
2,BE careful,"If you're going to use this thing, get the ""Shur Line Pro"" with the retractable guides. The model with just the wheels is GOING TO PUT PAINT where you don't want it eventually, no matter how careful you are. The model with the guides works, but you still have to be careful using it (don't forget to retract the guides when you are loading paint on the pad, etc). If you are patient and careful, with the pro model, it can be a great time saver..."
4,Good if you know how to use it,Can't dip it into paint you have to take a brush and brush it on thick to avoid putting paint on wheel which will get on ceiling. If you get this routine down this works good. Only other issue is the pad that comes with it work well the replacement pads at home depot are not as good.
5,Lifesaver,"This product was an absolute lifesaver on my last project. It probably cut the time I spent painting in half. My hand isn't steady enough to paint around trim and ceilings freehand & I hate having to tape everything off, so I gave this a shot & it worked perfectly. I didn't tape off a single thing & my edges are perfect. One tip though - don't dip this into a paint pan (even a shallow one), get a separate brush & brush the paint on. If you get too much paint on it, it will squeeze out the edges and/or get on the rollers, and thus, on your ceiling & woodwork. As long as you brush the paint on though, you're good to go! I'll never paint another room without this handy item!"
1,Leak,Thought it was an upgrade over the ones I usually purchase at Home Depot. Bought multiple ones and they all failed. Purchased one at Home Depot and worked fine. Have no explanation.
4,Very Useful!,"Read the reviews and was skeptical, but this product is easy to use and save A LOT of time. By the end of my painting job I wasn't taping at all. Even used this on an extension pole for near the ceiling and still had no problem.Tips: Load paint onto pad with a paintbrush and you will save time cleaning the wheels. Keep a damp cloth around to clean wheels periodically. Don't overload the pad or it will drip!This can get messy if you use too much paint, but all in all I'd definitely use this again and every time I paint. There is a little bit of a learning curve, but for the price this is worth it!"
5,Enduring Classic,"This enduring classic provides a comprehensive breakdown of the major Orisa, how they correspond to nature and the human mind and body and how the Orisa'Ifa faith impacts its devotees. An excellent book that broke ground for accurate and pro-indigenous religions of Africa.New copies at prices below $30.00 are readily available. Do not let unscrupulous vendors try to overcharge. Take your time, you will find a copy."
3,Plodding hagiography,"Willie Brown may be an interesting figure, but you won't find much here about him that you didn't see in the newspapers over the years. Richardson goes over his impoverished youth in Texas, and his stunning rise in California, but doesn't go very far into how it occurred. For example, Brown was said to be an intellectual, a voracious reader in his youth. Richardson says virtually nothing about WHAT Brown read. We learn nothing of the thinkers or writers Brown admired. Nothing is said about his work habits, his passions, his view of history, the kind of society he would like to shape.Over and over we are told of Brown's love of beautiful women, his ""flamboyance"", his expensive tastes. But who among us does not love beautiful women? And what, precisely, makes wearing an expensive suit flamboyant? If an expensive suit is flamboyant, then George Bush and Lloyd Bentsen must be flamboyant.Is it not important to know what a politician thinks, in addition to what he wears and drives?"
2,Maps,I like the other reviewers had a problem figuring out how to load the software so I kept mashing buttons until I got it to work. After playing with it for about an hour I got it to work and understand to use it. The maps are very good and just what I wanted however my biggest complaint which I didn't find out until I played around with the maps is that you can't upload the maps to your GPS.When you read the literature in determining to buy the maps it says it is compatible with my GPS ... well kind of. You can't upload the maps only the tacks. The reason I bought it was to upload the maps. Very disappointing.
2,Marginal,This is clunky and you have to import the game unit overlay each time. It's kind of like DOS with colors. It will give you an idea about what's there but isn't very user friendly or usable.
2,"not intuitive to use, roads not accurately placed","I am a professional geologist and use maps everyday. This product disappointed me in several respects:1. Moving around on the maps and zooming in and out is not at all intuitive. Google maps is much easier.2. Printing only gives limited options and paper sizes.3. Recent roads and trails, plotted in magenta, are often out of place and/or inaccurately plotted. In many cases, the topo maps have a a better position of the road/trail. For example, the magenta-version of the Iditarod trail, in the vicinity of Rainy Pass, takes off willy-nilly across the hills; its position on the original topo maps, where plotted, appears to be correct.4. Exporting the maps to a jpg fill is also limited.In short, although this product does provide, after a fashion, most of the topo maps for Alaska, it is definitly NOT a first class product. I would have expected something better, but I suppose this is a dumbed-down consumer version of the maps."
1,Not recommended for creating cycing routes & elevation profiles,"I returned this software after discovering that routes must be hand drawn on a map which makes it impossible to stay on roads, and precludes long routes due to the need to zoom out beyond the view that would include most roads. Thus creating a long road cycling route with elevation profile and total climb turned out to be impossible."
3,Hard to set up,"Great to have the topo maps at my finger tips, and I can customize and print exactly what I want. Don't have to buy the maps anymore. Why is it that I always had to buy three or for of the printed maps to get the area I wanted? Not anymore. These are great maps and easy to use...once set up. But, it is not intuitive on how to set up the maps. Took me several hours to figure out the process of how to download and set up the software. Recommended for the final product, but beware the issues are tough in getting there."
4,Useful Items,"I love the TOPOs. Along with a GPS unit, I am able to map my mtb rides annotate, and find again. Also, you have the ability to overlay other people's .gpx files, so you can really create a great map before starting out. Still helps to do other research, but these are a great starting point. Couple this with the water resistant paper"
2,NOT user friendly,"This is a fair program at best. Not user friendly, but maps are better than garmins. I would not buy it again."
3,Parishoner Book Club,"My church is trying out a Book Club for the families with young children and this book is a perfect fit. While we've only read the first 3 chapters,I can say that so fact it is certainly thought provoking."
3,RATTLE MY CHAINS,"The snakes in SILENT PREDATORS are some nasty critters, to say the least. We first meet them twenty years earlier, when a truck carrying this genetically bred rattlesnake wrecks, and the snake kills its two passengers. Fast forward 20 years and we meet Harry Hamlin as the new fire chief in a small town. Jack Scalia and Shannon Sturges portray the greedy land developer and his assistant who refuse to stop their bombing in spite of unleashing thousands of this newly bred snake. Suffice to say, the snakes do get loose, Scalia usurps Hamlin's power by bringing up a shady past, and veteranarian and Oscar-nominee Patty McCormack spouts out the balance of nature speech. A tense ending in a deserted mine shaft has sufficient chills and overall the cast and crew perform yeomanly. An above average TV movie."
2,VERY UPSET,THE ITEM I ORDERED SHOWED UP DAMAGED. THE CASE WAS CRACKED AT THE TOP THE MOVIE WAS SLIDING AROUND IN THE CASE. IT STILL PLAYED BUT WAS ALL SCRATCHED UP.
4,Good and Sturdy Cable,"We use plenty of AV cables at our video studio. We have had these for about two years and they hold up well. We plug them in and out of AV components. They are thick enough to carry a clean signal, but not so thick as some that, with repeated use, could loosen the connectors on equipment circuit boards.I like the blue color, but I would like to know for sure that it is not toxic."
3,BLOWN AWAY,"Wetheads Come Running is one of the year's best albums, a document and a manifesto against the Culture Industry, against the bands in the overcrowded underground who follow the lines chalked on the sidewalk without looking up or around and seeing new horizons"
2,It takes to many efforts to get hair straight,"It takes to much time to straight my hair.. The product is good if you have straight hair, but i have curly hair and i did not like the results i got from using it..Its definetly not professional styling iron,and will rate it 2 out of 5 stars.."
1,Disappointed with FHI Platform,"I am really disappointed with the FHI Platform. I had purchased a FHI a fews yearrs ago and was very satisfied with the performance and the results. I dropped it on a ceramic title floor and chipped it. The chip caused the plate to flap and my hair would get caught in the flap. After trying other brands (SEDU, CROC) I returned to the FHI. The first FHI Platform pulled my hair and caused breakage so I exchanged it. I thought maybe I had received a defected model because I did not have this problem with my older model FHI. Amazon happily and quickly sent me a replacement and I had the same problem. Major pulling! I returned it. I'm still looking for a flat iron that worked as good as my first FHI."
1,Product doesn't work,"I plugged it in, turned it on, adjusted temp, and nothing happens. Did it a few times. Gave it a rest. Tried again. Read instruction again. Nothing different from the other one I own. It is official. It is malfunctioning product. I don't even know how to return a product on Amazon.com. I never had the need to do so. It is such a burden and wastes time in a life of a extremely busy person... me."
1,Horrible,"Purchased this item, was a knock off and did not work. Spent an additional 14.00 for shipping and this is not the true manufacture maker. Not to mention I'm still waiting for my refund and was never notified that I could send it back. Lucky thing I went on Amazon to order something else, or I would of missed the return date. Overall I give it a minus 5....Also in order to summit this I was forced to give it one star!"
2,Needs more organization,This book need a little more organization as it is not easy to find the subject one is looking for. I was trying to find how to sort a merge- - -never got there. Office 2007 is a lot different than the Office version I have been using. It is like a totally new world. This book didn't help much.
3,Some Of Tim Hardin's Best From 1966-1968.,"There are 12 tracks here, all remastered, 1-7 from 1966s Tim Hardin 1, 8-11 from 1967s Tim Hardin 2 and 12 from Tim Hardin 3: Live In Concert.From my viewpoint in the UK Tim is better known as writer than recording artist or performer.On this CD he often sings against a sparse folk backing, at times with some strings.Reason Believe is a lovely gentle love song which many others have covered, perhaps most successfully by Rod Stewart.Add If I Were A Carpenter and Lady Came From Baltimore and you have two more fantastic songs, both covered by many artists, I think best of all by Johnny Cash on 1975s J.R.Cash (sadly not put out on CD).The album only provides 29 minutes, so much more of this talented man's work could have been included."
5,"Lovely, fragile, masculine voice",I had a brief encounter with Tim Hardin in my late teens. I knew some of his work and was indifferent to it. I have since grown up and recognize the beauty in what he accomplished. Too bad he didn't live longer. There would have been more to appreciate.
5,Understanding Diabetes 10 th edition by H. Peter Chase,"I am a diabetes educator and this is the book I recommend to all the parents of a child that has diabetes. When a child is first diagnosed with diabetes the parents are overwhelmed with information and do not remember everything the nurse or doctor tells them and I find that this book gives all the information in a nut shell. It will also help answer the everyday questions of What ""if"". It is a excellent resource and gives very good examples of what the bloodsugar should be for each age, how much food to give for exercise, the action of insulin how to treat low blood sugar and what to do on days that your child is sick. etc. It gives pretty much all the information you need."
5,The Diabetes Bible,"This book explains what you need to know if you/your child are newly diagnosed in an easy to understand language. We were given the book while our daughter was in the hospital, and even though we have many more books in our diabetes library now, this one has the most marked pages, and is definitely the one we read the most, especially in the first year."
2,too bad it has corn syrup,I was getting ready to purchase this product but the fact that contains corn syrup make me change my mind. Many of us are having issues with corn syrup. I appreciate the fact that they disclosed all ingredients before I placed the order. Hope this could change in the future.
3,A very different Moorcock,"If you only know (as most people do) Michael Moorcock through his Elric series, this will be quite a different take on the Eternal Champion. gone are the massive oddities of most of his volumes, gone are the gods and slimey monsters on every page. Instead this is as close as Moorcock comes to writing Historical fiction, which he does to mixed effect. It is not until the third section that we find Moorcock consciously tying the series into his Eternal Champion run.Moorcock is a passable, but far from stellar, writer. His Elric series has some intriguing ideas, but he wastes a lot of space on pointless battles. This book has fewer battles, but still you feel as if there is a lot of empty space to it. While it is definitely a cut above most fantasy, it is far from Tolkein, Kay, LeGuin or any of the other talents of the genre. Hidden within this volume are many fascinating nuggets, but it still feels like a roleplaying game written down with a bit of filler."
2,"""Do you the devil's work""","The writing of this book seems to have been fueled by a partial belief in something akin to Theosophy and/or Satanism, a study of the nastiest bits of the last 400 years of European history, and quite possibly a lot of hallucinogenic drugs. This is especially true of the first two novels (there are 3 novels and a short story in the book) which feature a world dominated by a seemingly unknowable, petty, arbitrary God and a repentant Satan who is mostly a pretty good guy just trying to bring enlightenment and an end to the world's pain. Aside from a few overly-trippy/esoteric parts the quest-style adventuring was somewhat entertaining, but the overall philosophical points of the book (which were often presented in a very preachy manner) were a huge turn-off for me."
4,"The War Hound and the World's Pain, book 1 of this omnibus.","I would rank War Hound and the World's Pain among Moorcock's top 5 (along with The Quest for Tanelorn, Stormbringer, The King of Swords, etc.).The book was, alone, worth the price of the omnibus.The atmosphere of the book, though, shows it's authorship in the 60's, and it's style of writing is also of that era. And while this is not in any way bad to me, I have run into a few who dislike all non-modern styles. For me, this was good, because it evoked feelings of my first reads of Elric and Corum, taking me back to faraway days."
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"I thought this book was extremley boring. The first part was fairly good but there was hardly any action. The only reason why I kept on reading was because I hoped it would get better, but I was disappointed. The second part was absoulutely horrible. I fell asleep twice while trying to read this section. I greatly enjoy reading Moorcock's books, especially the Elric saga, but this book was a complete let down. I think Moorcock is one of the best authors of his time and I was expecting something more entertaining."
4,Super Reader,"From Millenium, it is also subtitled The Tale of the Eternal Champion 1.It contains The Warhound and the World's Pain, The City in the Autumn Stars and the Pleasure Gardens of Felipe Sagittarius.This omnibus collection contains two Von Bek novels and ends with a short story that features yet another of the Von Bek clan. This time it is Minos Von Bek, who is a metatemporal investigator in Europe.He comes across Adolf Hitler, and ends up supplying Eva Braun with some useful toys"
1,live,this crap is all live. i wish someone would have warned me. i dont like the how crappy the vocals are.
5,Bad Boy Bill drops DA BOMB again!,"Even better than the Vol. 1, Bad Boy Bill continues to bring house music to a higher level. This man from Chicago is one of the top DJ in the country, and this CD shows why. 60 minutes of non-stop house music. Add it to you collection"
4,Another great CD,"Better than the first one but the 3dr is better than thi, he just gets better and better on all his cds"
4,saddle baq map,Nice map for major roads etc. These are not detailed maps by no means. But they are perfect to be in my harley saddle bags when I need a map to get home or etc. They are all covered in plastic and fold great. I have them encase my cell phone GPS does dead and I have no idea where I am.
2,Cheap strap clips,"Nice bag (in fact I bought it because I have had another one for many years) but the strap's clips are garbage. One broke when I was carrying the bag, sending the strap end flying by my head and almost hitting me in the eye with the remaining metal part of the clip. Strapworks made me a fine replacement strap."
4,"good, sturdy portfolio","This portfolio is a plastic type material that is acid free, and wont get ruined by a little rain. The zippers and fasteners are sturdy and work well, so I am pleased with it. It's nothing fancy, but If protecting your work is the main goal, this will do it."
4,artist's portfolio case,My experience would've been perfect except for the fact that the handle had jagged plastic leftover from the molding process and it cut my hands the first time I had to use it. I filed down the problem areas and it's fine now. there should be a little more care given to the product before it's sold to the public.
2,It would've been a 4 star item...,"But then it sliced my flippin ring finger on the way to the studio!I wish I read the reviews on the poor quality control. The handles look fine from just a glance, but if you take a second look, they aren't really finished. It's kind of like wood that hasn't been sanded. Easy fix though I guess. I got a sanding block and sanded the inside of the handles. Still, this is a pretty decent portfolio. It fits quite a lot of things inside. I've got two 18x24 80lb drawing pads, 7 pencils, a pen, a rolling ruler, two triangles and two erasers in it.As for why it would only be four stars though is because I also wish it had shoulder straps.If you're shorter than 5'8"" you'll be dragging this on the floor if your arms are relaxed."
4,interesting view,"An interesting view of the underlying motivations of a persons achievement of confidence without swagger. This work reveals the perceived and actual motivations of the authors drive to be the best.Each chapter stands on its own but is also an interesting view of the components of the warrior mentality. They can and should be used by all others pursuing their own path to ""the best""."
1,Not a good textbook,"Breslow and Day's Cancer Research book features poor readability and a presumptious way of writing. Their book seems to be more suitable for those beauracratic agencies or just for decorating your shelves...If you are a new comer to the cancer research field and hoping to learn something in the area, what you would experience is a total frustration. So what I suggest is that DO NOT buy their book!"
2,Interesting concept but could have been better,"First off, I am a big George Eads fan, which is the primary reason I got this film. That being said, I think it was an interesting and rather intriguing concept but slowed and lagged after 45 minutes. The first half is very good especially how the town is introduced to us and how the director shows the intrigue build when we see the notebook with the dates of when people died. But after that is seems to lose itself and the climax was rather flat considering the build up leading to it. I expected something on the same level as the Lottery. I also thought that the son had a stronger moral and ethical streak in him than the father, whom I thought was being kind of selfish. I didn't think it was a great film but it wasn't bad enough that I wouldn't recommend it. Just don't expect much."
3,SPRING FEVER,"This made for t.v. feature stars Kyle McLachlan (Twin Peaks, The Hidden) as a single father traveling across country with his son (Joseph Cross). A chance encounter with a strange couple with car trouble leads them to the quaint little town of Springville. Not such a bad place---everyone is young, and the reason is the titular spring, which acts as a sort of fountain of youth, with strings attached.So as not to give away the plot's ""secrets,"" suffice to say that Kyle finds out being young is not always being wise. Poor Kyle seems totally bored with his role and it's up to Alison Eastwood as the town doctor and George Eads as the local mechanic to bring some sort of life into this thinly structured plot. It's pleasantly gore free, and deaths are staged without blood and guts. It ends up being a less emphatic version of Shirley Jackson's classic short story, ""The Lottery."" But overall, not a bad movie, just nothing special."
3,The Spring,"A single father is traveling with his son, Nick. They stop in a small town where Nick has an accident and has to spend some time in the hospital. While Nick is hospitalized his father falls for the nurse who gives up the towns secret (a spring that has healing powers and is virtually a fountain of youth)."
1,spring me outta here,This is about as low budget as you can get.It has made in Canada written all over it.Just in case anyone has the misfortune to sit through this drivel I'd best not reveal the plot they'll be mapping out in a cemetary after they see this debacle.The acting is atrocious except for Alison Eastwood who incredibly manages to remain intelligent throughout this debacle.Kyle Mclachalan is dreadful-in fact he's so bad I often thought watching this movie that he was going to walk into the camera.He has an emotional range of 1 to -1.There are thousands of great movies to be had on Amazon.com-this is not one of them.
3,Worth every penny,"After hemming and hawing of the price, I finally bought the book, and was it ever worth it. People always talk about the maroger mediums, but this book is soooooo much more. I already knew the mediums, it was all the other information packed around them that make this book worth every penny. It is now my most valuable book (and second most costly). And, as the title says, now it is my secret."
5,Night music at it's best,"Incredible CD... we put this CD on every night... soothing, relaxing...in fact it's so relaxing that I never get to hear more than 5 minutes... so now we've started listening to it during the daytime.My only problem is that I can't find any more CD's by this composer."
5,Heartfelt Message and Performance,"What a wonderful performance of a heartfelt message! A finely engineered production of easy listening, bluesy music conveying deep, emotional messages on the value of children and how the court system often mishandles these innocent bundles of humanity. The music and voice production is smooth, convincing and a joy to the ears. Even more convincing are the deep-felt, thought-provoking lyrics by Craig Deanto, an individual who lives the experience he expresses in each song, including the concluding track in which he personally conveys his message and hope. This is a moving production that warrants repeated play on the air and in the heart of all who really care about the children."
1,This isn't the real Dr Bombay,This isn't the real Dr. Bombay who released the awesome Rice and Curry album.This is not EuroPop.
4,A Christian recording artist's take on life,"Singer/songwriter Carolyn Arends shows her versatility by authoring this book, and a fine first effort it is. Similar ground has been covered before by others (Philip Yancey, John Fischer, etc.) but Carolyn writes from the perspective of her own life experiences. Questions and doubts are part of any honest Christian's life, and Arends shares honestly about the uncertainties and fears in her own life, as an artist, wife, and mother. She shows much promise as an author, and it will be interesting to see her growth in this area over the years (although I'm afraid I'll have to pass on her next book, since it is geared toward pregnant women!!)"
3,Chickens in your backyard!,This was very easy to read and it helped me discover that I didn't want to raise chickens.
2,A beginners guide,"This book is very outdated! Not very wel structured.It is informative,could use more detail, not what I expected after the all the great reviews."
2,Too basic...,"This book is just *too* basic, if you don't know this stuff you probably shouldn't be thinking about raising chickens in the first place.Just not worth the money, in my opinion."
1,How to betray your friends,"How can you possibly kill a little sweetheart who loves you and trusts you and gives you so much (eggs, ""entertainment"")? Cold. Cold-hearted. I'll learn how to care from them from someone with a conscience."
5,EGG-CELENT!,This is the first book that I bought when I started my backyard flock.It is chock-full of great and helpful information to get you on your way!It even helped a country girl like me brush up on the ol' chicken talk!
4,Quick Read of Book,Chickens in your backyard is a good over all starter book. It would have been a little better if it specified dimensions for coup and nesting areas.
3,"Good, timeless advise, but missing pages","The information in this book is very useful, though obviously outdated, as it was published in the '70s. It is very easy to read and comprehend for a first time chicken keeper. But some of the advise, on where to look for chicks and where to get vet care for them, isn't very relevant for nowadays. This is a good book to start reading first, then supplement with other more modern books on the subject.One big gripe about this book: Page 141 (one which type of chicken to get) missing completely and pages 139 through the end are all mixed up. I returned the first book I bought in hopes that it was just a printing fluke for this one copy, but the replacement print had the same error."
2,Least favorite chicken book,"Not terribly useful, or expert advice. The story of them buying a Samoyed puppy to ""protect"" the chickens especially highlighted their ignorant spots. I'd definitely buy the Storey guide first, then second, the book ""Keep Chickens..."" by Barbara Kilarski for entertaining and useful backyard chicken keeping advice."
4,Great Beginner Guide!,"This book is written with the beginner in mind, and keeps the reading interesting with humor."
5,Great book!,I already have this book. I have referred to in several times and in most instances it has been quite helpful. I like that it uses terms you can understand without having to have a degree in veterinary medicine!I recently bought another copy of this book as a gift for my neighbor who is new to raising chickens.
4,Expertise!,"Nothing much can be said beyond the fact that this is the seminal text on chicken husbandry so if you're interested in getting started, reading this would be a good beginning to your endeavors."
2,More of a book for kids,"This book has very little substance, some nice drawings and almost no hard info about the subject. Storey has better info about this subject by yards. Poulty is such an amazing subject - with so many differnt kinds of birds. None of which you will find out here."
2,not worth the shipping,"This book seemed long and meandering. The illustrations were very good which is I gave it any stars at all. There were to many side stories that did not help the flow of the book such as, Decartes falling in the Seine and having soggy bread, getting sick, and needing to use paint on his floor instead of charcoal. It was choppy and the illustrations were the only funny part in the book."
4,Enjoyable Way to Learn,"This was easy for my 6 year old to read while teaching about Descartes and his grids...through a story about what he did one day while he was sick in bed. She understood afterward what the grids were used for and how they worked. I didn't know anything about Descartes before having this read to me either...so it was informative for us both! We love these readers for combining reading practice with science, math and history facts in enjoyable tidbits."
3,"Good, but flawed","This is a significant study that suffers, however, from insufficient knowledge of Islam."
1,Doesn't discuss Islamic institution of slavery,"Human slavery was embraced and endorsed both by the Koran and the Hadith. Islamic slavery begain with Mohammed and continued until the 1900""sfor 200 years after slavery had been abolished in the west. Saudi Arabia did not abolish slavery until 1964, Kuwait did not abolish slavery until 1968. Slavery is Islamic as daily prayers. Robert Segal documents the fact that 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their homes and sold into slavery in the Ummayad, Abassid and Ottoman empires. The general practice was to castrate the males and press them into military service. No Muslim can object to slavery as it was fully endorsed by Mohammed and it become the military modus operandi of the successors to Mohammed who successfully used slavery soldier in their campaigs of conquest."
4,good but I have one problem,"I would have given this book five stars if it wasn't for the strong opinion the author had about another excellent book on the subject. Diouf says in this book that ""(Dis)Forming the American Canon"" by Ronald Judy is filled with deconstructionist jargon. The other thing which bothered me about this book was the fact that she failed to mention that Judy's book contains perhaps the best translation and analysis of Ben Ali's ""Diary"" even though it's not a full translation.I found the information regarding muslim slave revolts and the muslim legacy most interesting. The discussion about how traces of muslim/arabic culture have been preserved in the african-american culture (many times unknowingly) through poetry and music is particularly interesting."
2,Somewhat frustrating...,"You were born on a spaceship traveling between two galaxies. You now can select which planet, and therefore which galaxy, you will now be a citizen of. Which planet will you go to? What adventures will you have in getting there? Will you find either of them?No likely. Space is full of black holes, wars and hostile races. Will you give up your search and join the Universe Governing Body to try to bring peace to the galaxies? Or will you pick a side to fight on, joining in the wars? Will you travel in time, explore new worlds or go to school?Most of the 44 possible endings seem to be your death or some vague ending without any real meaning. I'm surprised that, as a kid, I kept trying to find the endings I wanted."
2,"thin material, rips","I bought this sleeping bag a year ago and decided to write a review. First the material is very thin and so it rips very easily. I just got done sewing the entire seam back together. Second, the material is very cold, i wish i would have bought a fleece one. Will be buying a new one soon and not this one."
4,Good for a girl,Good product for a little girl. Have not used it in the cold but leaves plenty of room for my 4 year old to grow into.
3,"Looks nice, but I'm not sure about the warmth","I subtracted 2 stars only because I'm concerned about the lil' guy being warm to 30degrees in this thing.Is it cute (c'mon thats why we buy this!) YES!Does it work... YES!Does it look well made...debatable, how about OK made.Will it keep them warm - YES, if you do summer camping.NOTE: We do high elevation camping, as well as desert, and winter (not -15 winter) so your results may vary. Heck, this might be perfect for overnights, and summer camping."
2,Not great quality,"I got this bag for my five year old boy to take on sleepovers and car-camping.The first time he took it on a sleepover (indoors) it started coming apart at the seams, so the fill was visible.As I was packing it to return it to Amazon, I saw that the stitching on the stuff-sack was really weak as well.I exchanged it for another of the same, because it's cool-looking and seems perfect for kids. However, if it's the same poor quality, I will bite the bullet and get him a ""real"" bag. Too bad, I thought it was going to be great."
4,Very Cute and Usable,"My girls were thrilled to receive these for Christmas. They're cute for girls, without being ""faddish."" It fits my 7 yo perfectly, with room to grow length-wise (she's 46""). They've only used them on the floor so far but have said they're warmer than blankets. I'm pleased and look forward to using them on a camping trip. 4 stars because the carrying bag it's supposed to fit in is so small."
1,sleep over nighmare,Don't buy this item! Our 3 year old granddaughter spent the night with us using this sleeping bag and the elastic cord in the hood wrapped around her neck and arm so tight it took my husband and myself to remove it. So glad I was close enough to hear her strugling.
2,MUCH shorter,"The sleeping bag is MUCH shorter than the item description. It is nice, but my girls won't be able to use it long. My oldest that is only 54 "" tall, is too tall to be comfortable. I had to go out and buy her a new one. Only good for little kids."
5,Sleeping bag,My niece loved this sleeping bag as a Christmas present. My sister-in-law said that she was oonstantly sleeping in it either on her bed or on the living room floor. :)
5,Love it!!,Ordered this sleeping bag for my 5 year old and he loved it. We needed it at a a fishing lodge we were staying at for Thanksgiving. I read the other reviews of it being made of cheap materials and falling apart. Mine seems to be well-made and sturdy. Looking forward to him using it for the coming years. Definitely kept him plenty warm.
2,Disappointing,"We ordered these bags for our young boys, expecting them to be used for summer camping and occasional backpacking use. We were disappointed with several aspects of the bag (perhaps our expectations were too high...) 1)The color was the worst color green I have seen. Not anywhere close to the color in the online pictures, regardless of retailer. 2) The quality of the shell material seemed very thin and poor. 3) The fill was not of good quality. We are returning these bags and looking for replacements."
2,Eureka Sleeping Bag for Girls,"I was very excited to find this ""middle of the road"" priced sleeping bag for my step daughter's summer camp experience. It is very difficult to find a well made / value sleeping bag that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. She was excited about the color and the fact that it had a little pocket for her stuffed animal inside. When we received, we opened up and found a tear in the seam and the stuffing was coming out. Luckily I ordered in plenty of time for a back up plan. We returned I went to Cabella's and purchased a pink camo bag to replace it."
4,Very Nice Bags,Bought two of the Eureka Grasshopper sleeping bags for my grandsons and they are great bags. Good quality and the boys just love them!
5,The boy liked it very much,He likes how he sleeps in it. He likes how the hood goes over hs face. He likes the inside pocket. He likes the color of it. He thinks it is warm. He likes that he doesn't have to share with his sister.Review done by JonathanEdited by Troy
5,Awesome Bag for a Kid,"Excellent product. If you backpack with kids, they should be carrying this. Bought this for my son, he is now 11 and still using it. May outgrow it in another year but it has worked very well.Used it in temps around 40 and my son was more than comfortable. He is a very thin boy and I worry about him getting cold but he sleeps better than me. I throw a fleece blanket in it when we get in the 30's.Great product."
4,Great with one fatal flaw,"When we first got the sleeping bag, everyone in my family loved it. It was not only perfect for my 7 year old son, but we all found ourselves snuggling up on the couch with it. It was warm, light, and the perfect size for draping over yourself for a nap. However, within 2 months, the zipper gave out. I don't know if this was a fault with our particular bag, or because we used it to death, but it was disappointing."
1,Just so cheap.,The lining is super thin and it was already torn when I pulled it out of the box. Not only that...but the zipper broke the first time I zipped it up.
2,Rating is for packing and selling a returned item as new,"I received the item in an obviously used condition. The box was patched with scotch tape, the sleeping bag had a faint smell. I know, with Amazon lax return policy, it is regular practice for people to get an item, use it and return it (yes, they do that!), but somebody at some point should pay attention to this. I have paid for a new item and I think I am entitled to one, even if it is just regarding the packaging.Needless to say I never tried on the bag."
1,Terrible Product,"We have returned this item 4 times and every time it rips. My son only sleeps in it in his bed. Hasn't even taken it backpacking! Amazon has been great about returning the item, but I would recommend to stay away from the item. The seams continue to rip."
5,very warm and snug,We bought this sleeping bag for my 8 year old daughter to use on a girl scout campout. She loved it and says that it was very warm and comfy inside. Overall we are VERY happy with this product and will buy another one for our other daughter.
4,Live @ Last on CD,"For anyone who has missed Cybill's cabaret shows, myself being one of those people. This is a live CD taped @ The Cinegrill from a June 2000 show including some live commentary and cabaret to a piano backing.Highlights have to be hearing live renditions of TALK MEMPHIS TO ME, THE PARTY'S OVER and most notable she finally covers the Al Jarreau theme song to her show, MOONLIGHTING. Also Cybill does magical interpretations of two new Janis Ian tracks: MEMPHIS & a very moving song SHE MUST BE BEAUTIFUL, both from Ian's 2000 CD 'God & the FBI'."
1,Going back to the store,"I got this camera today after ordering it from Circuit City and I will now be driving 2 hours to take it back to Circuit City! It will not install. I emailed Creative earlier, but haven't heard back from them. I read another review that said it would not work with Media Center, so maybe that's my problem; I have Media Center 2005! Creative should really tell people which systems do and don't work! I have spent several hours trying to get this STUPID CAM installed! It's going back to the store! I will buy another Logitech!"
1,Only cause there's no zero stars,"This was a painful experience from beginning to end. The software install took forever, and when it finally did go right, everything started to go wrong. I was getting max 4 frames per second. It looked like crap. The software itself was unintuitive and bulky. I'm running this on a p4 2.24 usb2 1 gig ram, 300gig hd space(windows xp sp2). This product is unacceptably bad. This is getting returned. If you don't believe me, just do some research on the internet. You'll find all kinds of people having all kinds of issues. Save yourself the hassle. It's not worth it."
2,Made to work with Windows?? Not!!,"Never could get this to work with Windows Media Edition. After hours of trying and multiple tech support contacts from Creative I finally got a smart tech person to say ""We don't make drivers for Windows Media Edition for your webcam It won't work."" Not up to speed. Don't buy from Creative Labs."
2,No built-in microphone - this is for video only,"I was surprised when I got this product. It IS for video ONLY.All Logitech webcams I used before come with an integrated microphone. This one does need a separate microphone to talk through the net.There is a tiny microphone in the package though, but I am really uncomfortable to hang it on my ear when I need to talk. Also, how can a headphone be shared by more than one person?You may need to purchase a bigger microphone to free your ear up and/or to share it."
4,Creative webcam,"Positives, easy to install, great resolution, good image and good software package.Negatives, frame rate slows down in lower light conditions. Only achieves full frame rate at high light levels."
3,Linux Support --- pffft,"The major complaint I have with Creative is that they designed this camera with virtually zero possibility of Linux driver development.The quality and features on this camera are decent, but I'd prefer to have the option of using it under Linux.I guess I'll just keep waiting until someone out there writes a driver for it. And I hope Creative learns from their mistakes. I'm planning on avoiding Creative webcams in the future because of this."
4,Not the originals!,"I bought this book for my younger sister. I was thinking that it was a collection of the five classic princess stories; Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast. It is not. Do not buy this book if you are hoping for the original Disney tales! This book has a collection of five stories, each featuring a famous Disney princess, but they are all new tales. My younger sister still loved it thankfully, and it is still a great book."
3,Returned for refund.,"The keys were lovely, and we have no regrets for ordering them and giving them a try. Unfortunately, none happened to fit the lock on an old cabinet, for which we bought them in order to try.The vendor called us back after 3 messages left for them, and said to return them for a full refund (minus the $9 DOLLARS(!)postage they charged us, plus the $1.75 (huh?) we paid to return them. We'll look forward to the refund, if and when it is received."
4,A Great Devotional!,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Chole's book, as I have her other books as well. She brings out truths with pictures that make it easy to think about throughout the day, bringing encouragement and inspiration when it is needed most. This is a great addition to my devotional reading, and it leaves me wanting more, as I read more than one chapter at a time."
2,"Average Book, not bible","I was expecting more from a book called 'Bible'. For starters, this book is great but it is not for advanced users."
4,Excel 2007 Review,"This is truly a voluminous book, probably by necessity. It is a good manual, but the font style is more readable or darker. There could be more function use explanation though of more simplified directions shown sometimes in the ""Tip"" sections. For instance page 382 offers chart element selection by advising to ""view the Chart Element, located in the ""Chart Tools-> Format -> Current Selection group of the Ribbon"". This is quite helpful with locating functions within the tool bar and execution of the desired action."
3,Ok for the moderate user,"As with all these ""bible"" software books. They are really a handy reference. Particularly for the moderate excel user.More seasoned users could do just as well with the hundreds of online help areas centered around excel. I picked up this book to help me get over the ""ribbon"" hurdle with excel; but find I simply use online help rather than cracking open this book.I give it 3 stars b.c it does what it professes to do."
3,2007 Excel Review,THE WORDS ARE A LITTLE SMALL TO READ AND THE GRAPHICS ARE A LITTLESHADED OUT . BUT THE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK WAS USEFUL .
4,Excel Bible 2007,Product came on time and in great condition. Everything you would ever need to know about excel is in this book
1,"tooo much literal explanation, hard to guess","this is not good book. too much literal explanation, and the most importnat is there has no any screen with highlighted instruction , so user can quick understand where and how to do it. With too many small words to explain the operation, it's hard for user to understand and it takes user too much time to search around the location of what the author trying to point out from the screen.I was trying to learn more skills of Excel, but after reading couple of chapters from this book, now my enthusiasm is gone!"
2,Excel 2007 Bible,"Recieved book timely, but ended up sending book back. Print was very weak or soft and made it very hard to read. I think I would have liked book had the print been darker."
4,Solid reference text,"I'm a long-time Excel user and have recently started using 2007. I found this to be a very helpful publication in finding out how to use the new features. It's not something you want to read cover to cover, but as a reference text it's well organized and easy to find the info you need.I also have been able to pick up a number of tips that I was unaware of to speed through formatting tasks. Have not used the CD-ROM that comes with it, so can't comment on that.My only quibble is the font size (bit small and hard to read). Has lots of screen shots which are very helpful but again, some are hard to read given the small fonts."
1,BEWARE!,"Beware ... ignore the description that says this CD is performed by the Beatles! In fact, the performers on the CD are: disc 1: the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra disc 2: John Bayless disc 3: Ofra Harnoy & the Orford String Quartet disc 4: the Rochester PopsThey say that if a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is."
3,Not my favorite,"I typically love, love all of Beverly's books. The plot was interesting and of course the historical data just outstanding. But it moved a little slow for me, and the ending was so predictable. But it was great to catch up with the family."
4,Very enjoyable,I really enjoyed this book. I am a big fan of historical romance novels and Beverly Jenkins is becoming a favorite author of mine. The romance part of the book is fun and the historical part is very interesting. The story moves fast and keeps your interest from beginning to end. I would highly recommend this book.
5,Beverly J. does it again !,"After a friend loaned me Indigo a few years ago, I have become a true fan of Beverly Jenkins books. This book has not disappointed me. In her unique writing style of history, romance, heroism, and hot black love, Winds of the Storm is unforgettable.Archer LeVeq (love the name), and the union dispatcher Zahra Lafayette made quite a team. In an Era when murder and mayhem to people of color were acceptable, it was good to read the early accounts of a black CIA organization led by Harriet Tubman to end this type of violence. Zahra was smart brave and strong. She exemplified what we've know all along, strength come in all races of people. The love story and the hot lovemaking scenes were the cherry on top of the sundae. I look forward to the stories of the other LeVeq brothers. Beverly, keep em coming. I'm a big fan for life!"
5,Another awesome book from Ms. Jenkins,I have read all of Beverly Jenkins novels. They are all great and this one is no exception. Each book I read leaves me wanting more. I want to hurry and finish the book and at the same time I do not want the book to end. I fell in love with the LeVeq family with Raimond and Sable's story. I am so happy that she has written more about these wonderful and sexy young men.I am eagerly awaiting the release of her next novel.
1,NOT ART - NO GOOD PHOTOGRAPHY,This book was not good. Less than a few good shots out 144 pages makes it the biggest waste of paper I've seen in a while.I would never reccomend this to even the biggest beastie boys fan (and I am one myself.) It's just plain whack photos of the band from their least influential period made me return the book.
3,Good Film For Mario Lopez Fans.,"This teacher (played by Jay Thomas) at first seems to be a teacher that deserves respect, however as the movie progresses we can see that just teaching students not to be tardy six times (because thae want to be late on purpose to be kissy-kissy with the girlfriend of he week) or not to forget their books isn't the only thing that bugs the man. He truly is not a man of heart and is sarcastic with the students even his own wife. Some students plot to kidnap Mr. Griffin and give him a dose of his own medicine. They do. They tie him up. What they do not know was he has pills he must take. Later that night, Mario Lopez and this girl have a change of heart and they go back to the site where Mr. Griffin was left. At first they can not find him, but then they do find his body. He is dead. The story continues... Good film for Mario Lopez fans. DVD offers no extras or bonuses."
3,ok movie...could have been better...,"...if it was more like the great book by Lois Duncan...this was a typical NBC teen movie, but as a theatrical film, it would have definitely been better...or maybe just with a better script....the actors however were good..."
1,Poor quality,I was disappointed in this movie as it was a copy and not an original DVD. I can only play it on certain machines as my laptop can't read it. For $30.00 plus dollars it was poor quality.
5,Good For a Little Character Development,"I have used this video after reading the book in my Literature class. The many decisions made by all the people in the book, make for a lively discussion. The Language concern I had initially wasn't an issue. The movie is just as good as I remember it from several years ago."
3,review on vhs tape,The product was well used but this is only to be expected as it was an ex rental tape. I paid for express delivery which the supplier did but the US postal service was pretty slow. I was on holiday in Florida and had the tape sent to my resort and it arrived in the afternoon we left. Still I got it in the end. Bought it for my daughter who is a teacher and I have had no complaints yet. With the exception of the US postal service everything worked out just fine
4,If You Want Something Light & Sweet,"Filling and satisfies my sweet tooth. These are like sweet, slightly stale (though I hesitate to use that word) bread-sticks that are lightly sugared on one side. 3.75 stars to be exact."
5,"Great CD, and it is in Mandarin Chinese","I agree with most of the reviews here that the CD is very soothing and provides good backgroud music. It works well for calming down a very active 22 months old toddler before bedtime, and most importantly, my daughter loves it. The entire CD is sung in Mandarin Chinese, contrary to a previous review that someone had said it was in regional dialects, which almost made me not purchase it (because I am a native Chinese speaker, and would like my daughter to hear more Chinese). But when I listened to it and matched the verses to the words printed inside the CD pamphalet, it is mostly in Mandarin Chinese except for the chorus in some of the songs were in the regional dialect. I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it."
5,Chinesse Lullabies-Beijing Angelic Choir,"I sent this for my adopted, niece to ease her transition into our western, culture. Thought it would make her surroundings a bit more familiar. Although it was meant for my infant niece, seems my sister & brother-in-law could'nt wait to listen. They enjoyed it so much that they immediately installed it on their i-pod(tm). I had occasion to hear it myself when I went to help decorate the nursery. The voices are so soothing...universal in their lulling effect...angelic to the point of being ethereal. I would highly, recommend this disc for parents of any cultural, origin. Even adults will feel at peace listening to these heavenly voices."
4,Sopnie's Wise Choices,"The young French mezzo-soprano, Sophie Koch, is featured in this selection of evocative art songs from the previous turn of the century, bracketing the year 1900. She is accompanied by an equally young and talented group of chamber musicians, incorporating the Quatuor Castagneri, Sophie Raynaud at the piano, and Vincent Pasquier on double bass. Together, they produce a wonderously haunting reflection of some of the most expressive songs written by Gabriel Faure', Ernest Chausson, and Ottorino Respighi. Faure' sets to music some verses by the great French poet, Paul Verlaine, while Chausson projects the plaintive lyrics of Charles Cros. As for Respighi, the only non-Frenchman, he leaps the language barrier entirely in his setting of Shelley's ""The Sunset"", in an Italian translation."
5,Lisa-Mom of two,Dragon Tales-Believe in YourselfWhat a great DVD for a 3 yr old. My daughter loves this show and the DVD is fabulous!!
4,Very Enjoyable Read,"This was a very enjoyable read !!! It was definately a book you didn't want to put down. I was very impressed! I've lived in Pittsburgh and knew exactly where he was talking about in the book, which added to my enjoyment. I could actually picture the characters at the places he was describing which was fun for me!!! Can't wait to read his next book!!"
4,His best yet!,Only those that remember the past will not make the same mistakes. This is best said with Muted Colors. You can see right through the authors eyes where and what is happening. Life sure takes some strange roads and this one flows with the great ebb and flow of an ocean tide toward conclusion.
1,Not much to enjoy,"STAR KITTY'S REVENGE consists of 19 tracks, only 11 of which are full-fledged songs. There are 5 interludes (tracks 1, 4, 10, & 14 are dialog; track 17 is a cappella quasi-chamber music sung by a choir of Jois), an under-two minute ""song"" performed by Joi's four-year-old daughter Keypsiia (""bonus track"" 19, complete with the girl's spoken introduction), the 2-minute-and-42-second dialog-dominated (almost) remake of George Clinton & Bootsy Collins's ""Munchies for Your Love"" (track 7, featuring then-husband Big Gipp), and ""Jefferson St. Joe"", a sung eulogy for her father, NFL player Joe Gilliam, which after 2 & a half minutes of vocals transitions into a sample of an announcer introducing him and crowd cheering, followed by instrumental-only for the remainder (track 18). Booklet contains track information, one whole-page photo and several small photos, and song lyrics."
3,One song,I purchased this album for one song. I played the album for a few weeks until it just got old.
4,She Breaks Hearts,"Joi toured with Fishbone and Goodie Mob in '96. She had dudes passing out cassette samplers of Amoeba... and you could tell that album was classic! Fast forward more than 15 years later, still no official album release. Joi might still have that album but its not widely appreciated on neo-soul blogs either. This 2002 album is sexy and hip with a unique sound that many R&B acts hadnt tried yet in '02. Her voice is in top form but unfair as it may be, the funk rock songs on some of Amoeba... is my favorite sound from her. Joi shows her versatility with a whole new sound. Fans of Prince, Lady Saw and Trina will all probably dig this funky album."
4,This Girl is GOOD!,"....and should get more airplay, as well as exposure. (I don't think enough people know about her)I just listened to the cd today & I have to say that it was MUCH better than I anticipated. It's got funky beats that just make you want to bounce with it... bounce with it. Joi posesses talent & has a great singing voice. When I first heard her I thought of Erykah Badu; that sort of raspy-type, unique-style sound. I'm purchasing it today. A MUST-HAVE for soul music lovers!!"
4,Frustrated Artists,"When I went to see Badu in concert, I got there late and missed Joi. At the time I didn't know what I was missing and now I feel regret. This cd is like nothing I have heard in recent years. She has not sold out in my opinion, but maybe because I'm a new Joi listener. If this cd was rushed, then I cannot wait for her to take her sweet time and hit us with yet another beautiful work of artistic, funky, original soul sound. I don't care what people say about Techno Pimp, this whole cd is solid. I love the presence of Raphael Saadiq- I would love to hear Lucy Pearl now. ""Lick"" is sexy, ""What If I Kissed You"" is provocative and ""Missing You"" is plain fantastic! Joi, come back! It's been too long already."
5,Captivating and Relevant,"Whoever said that Revenge is sweet must have foresaw this album. Because whatever was done to Kitty to spark such a revenge should be done over and over again. This album in on the edge. On the edge of R&B, Funk, and Pure Soul, while escaping the conventions of any of the contemporary categories. Joi's vocals are clear and moving. The lyrics are well written and compelling. This album is a delight from beginning to end and should not be missed. My personal favorites on the album are ""17"" of Snow"", ""What if I Kissed You Right Now"", and ""Missing You"", ""It's Your Life"", but all of the songs are funky. I have been a big fan of Joi since her first release ""The Pendulum Vibe"", but she is definitely more self assured and polished on this album."
4,Revenge is sweet,I have been looking at at Joi's cd for a while now(when I go to music stores) and I finally goot it(through my music club) I sooo glad I did. Joi's voice reminds me of earthy singers(like badu) but is herself in her own right. There is laid bakc vibe to this work and its not overly produced. It is somthing completely different from the mindless ho-hum of some R&B today. Sometimes is can be repitive but what cd isn;t. Joi also dosent oversing and knows just how to keep ur ears open. This is a must for anyne whos likes that 70's funk or just wants to try somthing different...
4,Worth your while,"If there's any problem with R&B; today, it's that a lot of these female artists sound the same (voice and subject matter). For example, if all of Missy's protogees (Gina Thompson, Nicole, Lil' Mo, and Tweet) came together and sang a song, could you tell any of them apart?Thankfully, Joi comes back to bring a much-needed change in R&B.; After two good but never well-received albums, she's here with Star Kitty's Revenge. With most of her weirdness that played throughout her old albums gone, fans will balk at her maybe selling out. But that's okay, because this is still a listenable album.To show that most can't get away with the stuff Joi sings about, check out the raunchy ""Lick"" and ""Crave"". Other notables are ""Missing You"", the Chaka Khan-inspired ""I'm a Woman"", and the fierce ""17 in. of Snow"".While I can do without ""Techno Pimp"", this album has all one needs to dance or just chill and listen. But this isn't quite neo-soul or strictly R&B;, so don't cop it fot those reasons."
3,Lick is a slowed down version of a song called White Horse,"A band called Laid Back had a song called 'White Horse' in the 80s. The basic riff in Lick is a slowed down version of the riff in White Horse. I just noticed this when listening to White Horse today. I am not sure if they simply sampled it, or just duplicated it."
3,Average at best,"I prefer her debut release ""Pendulum Vibe"". This album is not bad at all, but i've heard better stuff from other artists who've also dropped their albums this year. Ann Nesby's Put it On Paper for example:-)"
4,"Can't wait until Kitty ""Strikes Back""","So funky she stank. So honest it hurts. While she may get comparisions to Macy Gray or Kelis, don't expect her to sound like Jill or Amel or Res or anybody else. She doesn't attack social issues directly, but rather shares stories and expierences that force you to think through her infectious funk. If your a fan of the dungeon fam (Outkast, Goodie, etc.) then you'll most likely enjoy joi. But don't buy her expecting to be able to place her right on the shelf with you L Boogie album. Her inovation avoids definition, and like Lauryn, Larrieux, Scott, and Res, she deserves an open mind with a heart for music. Her lyrics are honest and her delivery is effortless and natural. If your looking for the latest fad, then stay away, but if your looking for thoughtful lyrics engulfed by funk, you've found the right album."
3,Has Moments But She had More Edge in the Past,"I was Excited about Hearing Her Coming Back but this Album overall is far Safer than I Expected.Her Debut ""Pendulum Vibe"" was tight.Her&Dallas Austin Created a Tight Album there.in fact Madonna enjoyed that Album so Much She went looking for Dallas after that Album.Joi was Badu but with Far More Edge.But this Album on a Whole is Safe Territory.She still Has Edge here&there but overall She is in a Different Area in Her Career now&It shows with the Overall Production&Direction.She is One of the Few Acts over the Past Decade that I'd Say keep a Ear on but Hopefully She gets back to More Edge on Her Next Album."
2,No great wisdom comming out of this book.,"No real secrets found! Every thing you need to run Vista is in the help menu. Media player does not work right. The book failed to mention that. When you down load a song from URGE, you can't play it in media player. You need to down load a new third party player. The writer should buy Vista and see for him-self, or is he saving that one for the next book?"
4,Great resource to a slightley confusing situation.,Paul and Brian did an excellent job in making the transition from XP to Vista as easy as possible. I definitely recommend this book!
4,A must have for new Windows users!,"Vista Secrets is written by two highly respected Windows experts. If you are new to the Windows operating system, or an intermiediate user, this is a must-have-it book.The writers cover virutally everything that is new to Vista and many things that are old hat to previous Windows versions. It's 600 pages of information that almost any user of Windows Vista will want to keep close by, as a handy reference source.It is too early in the life of the Vista operating system to declare this book the end-all for Vista users, but it provides a singularly strong start."
3,Not bad really,"Tips and tricks for getting the most out of Microsoft's newest operating system, Vista. Aimed at the novice to intermediate level user, Secrets illustrates hidden features and shortcuts in the software that may not be entirely intuitive to those not used to poking around into every nook and cranny of their computer's software."
4,Windows Vista Secrets,Easy to read and informative. I am not a geek so it was important to me to be able to follow along with what the author was saying. I can do that with this book.
2,Ouch... not the book I was expecting,"I bought this book because of Brian Livingston. I read his weekly ezine called Windows Secrets and have learned a lot from him and his cohorts over the years. After installing Windows' Vista I wanted to do so much more with it so I bought the book. After reading the entire thing, not one of my questions was answered. If you are looking for a book that just gives the highlights of Vista, buy the book. If your looking for a book that reveals the secrets of the techy side of things, keep looking."
2,Meh,"If you are skilled with computers this book is not for you. I was very disappointed. No ""secrets"" here. Just common everyday stuff I already knew. Previous Windows Secrets books were MUCH better."
2,Needs More Secrets,"A lot of the information is as relevant to XP or OS X as it is relevant to Vista. Mundane topics such as enjoying digital photos, ripping CDs, composing and sending email, managing your calendar... There are seventy-three pages covering fonts and character sets. Only six pages of narrative are dedicated to PowerShell. Yet fonts are not new to Vista and PowerShell is."
4,Really an Intermediate Overview,"This book is a decent overview that seems to be aimed at the home user preoccupied with using media; music, photos and video.As pointed out in another review, many components of Vista are not covered and the many pages of font minutia seem like padding. Not for the seriously technical types.It was amusing to find that their secret for IE7 was that Firefox is still a better browser!"
5,WINDOWS VISTA SECRETS is the item of choice for any who would get the most from their system.,"Windows Vista is the latest operating system and users serious about tweaking their system will thus wish to go beyond the usual Microsoft Help guide to consult WINDOWS VISTA SECRETS, a guide to installing Vista and using some of its new features - including undocumented ones - to streamline a system. From creating movies and DVDs to new security features and system pros and cons, WINDOWS VISTA SECRETS is the item of choice for any who would get the most from their system."
1,Altogether Unlistenable,"Maybe this album is just trapped in the 1990s, or maybe it sounded like this back then too. Anyways, today it sounds very very dated. The ""slick"" production unfortunately brings out the slightness of the songs and compositions, and I can't believe how cheesy those sax parts in the first song are! It's trying to be funk, I guess, but just winds up sounding like its TRYING to be funk. Disappointing."
1,Terrible,"First, this book is copyright 1945, so everything is out of date despite the recent reprint. Also, the book consists of 90% humorous stories about proposals - things that could never be used for an actual proposal. Just to give an example, one proposal was between a nurse and a patient, another between a woman redecorating her apartment and a beau (really). The book should be titled ""Proposals stories in weird situations."""
5,Brings back the memories,Started listening to BBB when i was about a junior in HS. Boy does it bring back some good memories. All of Underground constructions stuff was awsome. Sitting on AOL im'ing people and listening to this stuff was my idea of a good time.RIP Private room hip hopLOL..
4,Can't Beat Bad Boy Bill,"This album is incredible- it never slows down, and Bad Boy Bill just keeps it coming. Also check out the House Connection series with Richard ""Humpty"" Vision. Not to be missed."
2,Non-stop megamix too long,"Yeah, Bad Boy Bill can mix-he's awesome. But that's all this CD is-one long scratching mix. You never get to hear much of a song before Bad Boy destroys it and moves on to another one. Maybe this is what YOU like, but I found it got old after a few minutes."
4,A book about roses or the rose line?,"There is something a bit unusual about this book.Under the section, Special Interest Pot Pourris, there are pot pourri recipes, but they seem to be telling us more about Mary Magdalene in coded form than about flower mixes.My copy is dated 1988. That is eighteen years before the Da Vinci Code was written. Maybe the 'code' is in the roses afterall?"
3,its ok...,i liked the demo i got a few years back way better. it seemed to flow better. i was psyched to get the cd when i heard the demo but once i actually heard the full thing i was disappointed. on the full album everything just kinda sounds forced. the only song i really enjoy is Sour Times. i loved it when Portishead did it (was that the original? im not sure) and this ones a nice heavier twist.
3,Not what I expected,"Honestly, When I bought the ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" soundtrack and heard ""Middle of Nowhere"", I expected great things. I Expected a much darker album than what i heard. Addicted was the only other noteworthy song on the CD. Maybe I am Wrong, but you are doing better to pick up ""City of Evil"" by AX7 if you want some entertainment that will take you through more than 10 tracks."
3,eh,"seems like they're trying too hard to imitate old korn and adema. they're nothing like tool, which is one of the most innovative bands in the past 20 years. this is basically your standard radio rock, but a little better. i would pay maybe $6 for the cd, but not much more."
4,Good debut from a promising band,"In my searching of new bands to listen to, I found this band, and his original name caughted my attention. So I downloaded 'Middle of Nowhere' and say 'Hey, that sounds good!'. Then I bought the album, and I really like it.Well, of course they're not exactly original, and they're not an amazing band, but at least they have something to offer, and I think they can improve a lot in the future, and become an important band. Hard riffs, heartfelt vocals, deep rythms and some original sounds, like in 'Middle of Nowhere' (which I think is the best song in the album). It's that kind of bands that you instantly like, and the more you listen to, the more they like you.For me, TBT sounds really similar to TRUSTcompany, similar to Trapt, maybe to Staind, and of course it's similar to Tool, so if you like all this bands, some of them or at least other bands like this, then listen to 'Beyond the calm of the corridor'. Don't expect something new, just well done rock."
2,Not Very Good,"I really like Crashdog. They are Christian punk, but I like them anyway. This album, however, is not their best. I am not much of a fan of Spike, their first singer. The only good album with him is Mud Angels. Even that one isn't great. The greatest album they made is Cashists, Fascists and Other Fungis. This is one of my favorite punk albums of all time. Their guitar player took over vocals as Spike left the band. If you can find this album, buy it."
1,Animal Rights Wacko on the Warpath,"This man is nothing but a terrorist. His organization leads ""protests"" in which all involved sport black masks and destroy private property while spreading vile lies. He should be in prison."
5,Yummy gummies,"I bought those around a month ago. They are all gone now. They are amazing and taste just like the fruit. I like the plum one the best I think, but it's really hard to pick a favorite. It feels very juicy. Me and my roommate loved them. But I kind of got sick of it after eating 12 packs lol but this has nothing to do with the quality of the product. It's just that I'm not supposed to eat that much at once. Definitely would buy again. My mom loves those too!"
3,High sugar content,"Wish I could say these are fantastic, but I can't. They are extremely high in sugar, with the first three ingredients being: corn syrup, sugar, high fructose corn syrup. They don't have any artificial colors or flavors, but the flavors, of which there are 6, are very subtle. They don't jump out at you, so unless you eat them one by one, and really try hard to distinguish each flavor, it's hard to tell. They are very soft, almost too soft."
1,Money No More Extra Con,Company that manufactures this should be shut down and people responsible imprisoned for taking advantage of those who suffer from shingles.This junk does not work. Don't believe any positive reviews that you may have seen.It's all a big con job.I just saved you money and disappointment.
3,Nice Television Movie!,"I think over all this movie was not that bad. It was more or less alot like the novel written by Lois Duncan ""Gallows Hill"" I really enjoyed watching this movie on T.V and I like it so much I bought it again on video. Watch for yourself and then decide if it is good or bad."
4,great,i liked the movie alot but i was disapionted in the way they portray witches cuase alot of the stuff was not true but allin all it was great i loved it...
4,very enjoyable,I saw this movie on Lifetime some time ago and enjoyed it. I found it for sale for a fairly reasonable price and watched it again and I still found it enjoyable. It is more of a mystery with a little supernatural. The acting was enjoyable as well as the setting. I found the small town very quaint. I also liked how the sins of the forefathers had an effect on just about the whole town. It was interesting to see how the main characters were tied together.
2,scream wannabe,this movie's scary parts are just copying off of other scary movies.i hated this.the acting was terrible.i only gave it two because the ending was a little surprising.thats all
1,"Very, Very, Very Bad!","This appaling TV-movie proves how Hollywood just keeps on churning out those lifeless horror slasher movies in order to make a buck. The formula is bleed so dry that you hardly even see a killing, nor even a splatter of blood fill the screen. What's worse, not even the good-looking cast can save this clucker from the scrap heap; the acting is terrible. Save your money, save your time and just avoid this dreadful flick altogether. DROUGH!"
1,Was that suppose to be Scary???,"Really boring, There is no part of the movie that will scare you, not even a 5 year old kid would be scared by this movie. The Story isn't even good,the acting isn't that great either it's just a waste of time!"
4,Very good!,This is a nice mystery that shows you can don't need sex and/or swearing to make an entertaining movie. I loved the mention of 'Buffy'. Give this film a chance!
5,Dry Sense of Humor,"Simon writes with a twinkle in his eye, as he explains the technical aspects of XML in business terms. His business focus provides a general understanding to both business people and college students. His large number of examples and metaphors will also prove useful for others who are trying to explain the amazing powerful of the XML technology."
5,One superb book,An excellent autobiography. A genuine and a very interesting book which could be written only by somebody with as rich experience as Mr.Lionni's.
5,A Happy Discovery.,"Very worthwhile album. Bubbles up into the top quarter of my regular listening. Family was for me a happy discovery after having gulped down most of what the Industry Empire told me was relevant. Fine musicianship, wonderful tunes--they actually reached a high level of quality in a time where many were being over-rewarded for much less. They were also legitimate practitioners of unrepentant creativity and I assume, partying. So, ultimately they may have missed their own boat."
4,Not the original... but really? who cares?,"I read a lot of the reviews of this dvd, but must say I don't know what all the hoopla is about. Is styx after money? Yes- like it or not, rock music is a business. Does it matter? No. I watched this dvd back to back with Return to Paradise. Both are good, but neither is really superior to the other. The guy taking DDY place does not sing as well, but isn't as dramatic (a plus in my mind). The music is great. Tommy Shaw's energy and guitar playing, not to mention his seemingly unchanged voice, carry the whole show. I don't care much for JYs gutteral singing, but to re-create PoE, I suppose it was necessary. Other than that, this is a great set for only 15 bucks. It is worth the ticket price for Man in the Wilderness and Castle Walls alone (tho there are many other highlights). If you are a Styx purist, avoid it (but don't whine about it's existence either). If you just like good music performed well... its not perfect, but I'm glad I bought it."
1,No Dennis...,"I bought it. Watched it...Final conclusion: Dischargeable!!!!!Forget it, if you are really Styx fan! Go to old material."
1,Stynks without Dennis!,"While the music is still played well, the songs lack the original spark and ESPECIALLY the voice of Dennis DeYoung. It's really a shame that JY and Tommy have alienated Dennis from HIS band. I wouldn't buy this just on general principles. Styx is dead!"
5,Best DVD yet,I love this band.. I have seen them 16 times and they get better and better each time.. this shows how great they are with the vocals that bring these albums alive... BUY IT>.....
5,Just because I love the band!,"I have had the privilege of seeing a Styx concert in each of the last three years consecutively. They are marvelous and are as good as they have ever been. It is an all around wonderful presentation.Tommy Shaw, Todd Sucherman and JY Young are the main guys then Lawrence Gowan and Ricky Phillips fill it out. Each year Lawrence has gotten better with his vocal abilities. Ricky is a sensational bassist.Two songs that should have been included here are ""Too Much Time on My Hands"" and ""Crystal Ball"" - two masterpieces penned by Tommy and are amazing in concert! That withstanding, this recording is truly representative of the band as it is currently.Should you have the opportunity to attend a Styx show----by all means---- DO IT! And....get this recording!"
5,Great DVD of a great concert!,"I've been a fan of Styx since I was a young girl. My first album was Paradise Theatre and I've been hooked ever since. I've seen them in concert a large number of times and they just keep getting better every year. Yes, there have been changes in the line up (but there's a lot of bands out there with those same changes) but as much as I'm a huge Dennis DeYoung fan, I love this current line up. They put on an incredible show and this concert is no exception. I was lucky enough to see this show in Atlanta, and watching the DVD brought it all back. And the behind the scenes interview with crew members is a MUST SEE. If you like Styx you'll love this DVD."
3,Retro Artrockers release another live album.,I love Styx but this is like their fifth or sixth live disc without a new studio album. I'm just not going to hurry out and buy another live Styx record no matter who is in or out of the lineup. Even the last studio effort was a collection of covers that should have been a bonus disc with a new release. Give us a new album or pack it in guys.
2,Without Dennis it isn't Styx,"Sorry, yes, I know, the music rocks..... fine.But without Dennis DeYoung it isn't Styx. That is the band that made the sound that was so great, it's an overall sound, all inclusive. But without Dennis's signature vocals included..... it is not that band anymore. It is just a semblance of what was."
3,They're Pricing themselves out of the market,"On a pre-order basis the price of this particular DVD has gone up from $10.49 to $14.98 over the last couple of weeks and it hasn't even been released yet. If you want to encourage people to purchase your product on a pre-order basis then why not keep the price at $10.49 until the product is scheduled to be released on January 31st and then raise the price if it's a hit? At least then the folks that jumped, took a chance and ordered the DVD in advance will have the benefit of not having to pay full retail for something that's not even available yet."
5,Grand Illusion/Pieces of Eight DVD,"Fellow Stygians, if you haven't bought your copy yet I encourage you to do so. This DVD is one for the ages. Never thought they could out-do the Paradise Theatre DVD but they have done just that. Incredible music, incredible musicians, just an all around great time. Enjoy."
3,"They still rock, but it could have been better","A few people have suggested that without Dennis De Young it ain't Styx and I'm going to say- I know where they're coming from. Lawrence Gowen does an awesome job of filling DDY's shoes, but he doesn't quite have that vocal quality that defined many of DDY's songs. Also, although the concept of playing entire albums as a first and second half of a concert is an interesting one, there are two or three songs (particularly in the Pieces of Eight half) that really don't deserve a concert performance and it would have been better to hear more famous, or successful tunes rather than these. But it's still a joy to see Tommy Shaw and JY Young doing their thing- rocking out Styx songs with a passion and they are both very accomplished rock guitarists. It's a great show and the DVD is worthy of the money and a place in any DVD concert collection, but if you want to see Styx in full flight get the Return to Paradise DVD with DDY still in the band."
2,Ship has Sailed Away,"Without Dennis DeYoung, Styx has become just another cover band. They should stop trying to do the songs that featured him. He is an irreplaceable presence in their music. Tommy Shaw still retains his greatness but without the Dennis DeYoung/Tommy Shaw collaboration this band is way past their prime. I never really enjoyed the songs featuring Jame Young but they do those songs justice in this rendition.If you're a Tommy Shaw fan, this is worthwhile.If you're a James Young fan, this is a must buyIf you are a Styx or Dennis DeYoung fan, don't even bother. Listen to what you already own."
2,ORIGINAL STYX WAS BEST!,"The new lead singer and drummer are good, but Dennis DeYoung WAS the voice of STYX, just like Jon Anderson IS the voice of YES. No substitutions please."
5,Lower the price,"$69.00 for three disc! Why is this priced so high?It's a great CD but come on lower the price!Thank You,Scott Kupitz"
4,Brother CS-8150,This sewing machine is pretty user friendly. It is great for someone that was just a little more then the basic sewing machine. It has been great adding a little extra something on the items that I am creating.
1,Do not buy this machine,"I received this sewing machine for Christmas 2004. The first time I used it it did great. Came back the next day to finish sewing a dress and the bobbin thread kept getting tangled. Managed to finally finish that dress and moved onto the next dress. I had to change thread color and the automatic threader stopped working, the bobbin would not wind properly. It was only winding at the top of the bobbin and not evenly throughout the bobbin. I pulled the manual back out and re-read the instructions and started over from scratch and continued with the same problems. Finally got to sewing again and the needle position keeps moving so it does not sew in a straight line. The stitches are also loose with the tension setting on 5. I adjusted the tension up and down and the thread stayed the same.I'm returning this sewing machine and will be getting a new machine and it will not be another Brother!"
1,Save your money...buy a singer!!,"I was initially impressed when I first bought this machine. It was fairly simple to use. After a few months the computerized part of the machine shorted out (my sissors touched the needle when I was clipping a thread), which has made the machine now useless. I called Brothers NOT tollfree support line,and was on hold for a half hour. The 'lady' I spoke too was definately not helpful(or courteous), I can take the machine 200 miles away to their 'authorized service center' otherwise they can't help me. So basically I now have a $300 paperweight. After dealing with the support center, and with their sub-par product, I will never buy another brother anything. Save your money, buy a singer to start with!!!"
1,Don't Buy This Machine!,This machine has been a nightmare from the day I purchased it. I have been sewing for over 30 years and have never had so much frustation as I have experienced with this machine. The tension does not stay in place and the bobbin winder has been repaired and still does not work properly. I doubt that it ever will. And now the automatice threader does not work because all the mechanism fell out of the bottom of the machine. I agree with comments made that the manual is full of errors as well and this is a shame because you have to keep going back to it to try to make things work on this machine. Buyer beware.... DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!
5,This series is great!,"I first heard about the ""Ring of Fire"" series from a newspaper review, which described the travel adventure as one of the greatest journeys since Marco Polo. The show really opened my eyes. It made me think about how much the world has changed since the Blair brothers made their film; it also made me relaize how different the world will be in another 20 years. I immediately made it one of missions in life to see as much of the world as possible before ancient cultures are forever changed by Micky Mouse t-shirts and cheap digital watches. I'm buying this series to remind me of the passion for travel that the show instilled in me. Thank you, Blair brothers, for letting us share in your great adventure."
4,little chicken ace in action,"It was a fun gane to play, unfortunately a bit repetitive. The puzzles are the same through the game, but the price was good for what it is. It is mainly a shooting game, and I was expected more form it. Overall, it is a good game though."
3,"Ok game, but not too good.","I personally never played this. My kids 6 and 11 played it once in a 3 month time period, and only then because they were bored with other games. I do not recommend this game."
5,Yes In Fact,"I am a proud new grandfather (last night!) Oh who listens to anyone my age! (56)I am happy about stuff, but I was Really sad when Kate died a few months ago.Really have thought no other chanteuses mattered as much as these two have, so to lose one of them is hard.This might be the best pop record I have heard in the new millenium. I can think of a half a dozen contenders but this could be it. It's definitely worth the money -- but the above commenter was right: get it from Amazon.ca. I took his advice. Thanks!"
3,"Nice finish and cut, but a bit thin...","I bought both chrome and black frames. Based on its retail price, I expected the frame would be ""heavy duty"" (i.e. thick metal), but I was disappointed when I received it. It's thin, light, twistable like a plain $5 frame found at local auto part stores. I think the frame should have been at least twice the thickness. The finish and edges are clean though. To me a good frame, beside having nice finish and clean cut, should be stiff (i.e. thick) enough so it doesn't twist and keeps the licence plate from rattling when driving on rough roads or pot holes. To me this frame doesn't seem worth $30. Maybe $15..."
4,Fantastic set,"I really gotta thank reviews of this DVD for selling me on it. The bonus features were fantastic and the entire set was well put together.I've always been a fan of this show since it came out and this set was a very good, well put together item. Completely satisfied.One star was lost on account of one of the box corners being slightly frayed and smashed and this wasn't something that was stated in the information for the product. I don't know if it was damaged in transit but it was damaged nonetheless."
5,"Amazing Value, Even Better Series.","I ordered this DVD set after hearing great things about the show from some fellow anime fans. I was really excited to be able to get the entire series for such a bargain price. I wasn't disappointed one bit. There are not a lot of frills to this release, but I wasn't expecting a ton of extras. All 26 episodes of the show are here, on four discs. The packaging is pretty decent, with each DVD having its own spot in the case. I would have paid much more for this anime if I had to, but I am thankful that I didn't. This series is one I am glad to have in my collection and will re-watch many times I am sure. It's worth it."
3,Much too much of a good thing,"If you're a Mac user I presume you have little interest in unneccessary complexity--and GoLive delivers a level of complexity & difficulty that would make Microsoft proud.If designing web pages is your life this may be what you need. And believe me, it WILL be your life for months after you start using this application. You'll get to know every member of the GoLive support team on a first-name basis.For the rest of us, please, Adobe, make a GoLive Elements program or bring back PageMill."
1,not as advertized,"sold as the original software but sent an upgrade. Can't upgrade what i never had, and have no idea how to return it."
1,Worthless. Money better spent elsewhere,"The Adobe team has a way of creating complexities for no particular reason. GoLive drowns in its own muli-tier, reverse-logical design. The development team has obviously intended this program to be used by those totally unfamiliar with the concept of straightforward thinking. Every moment using this software is agonizing and frustrating. It boggles the mind to even imagine the possibility of an Adobe team with usability as part of their gameplan. Please stay far away from GoLive."
3,"Oblivian's are dead, long live Reigning Sound","I can imagine a lot of the hard core Oblivians fans who bought Greg Oblivian's first ""Tip Top"" solo outing were sorely disappointed by the snappy pop tunes (although still Lo Fi sound quality). If you were one of those people, then definitely don't buy this album (however, fans of bands like Uncle Tupelo and American Music Club will proabably like it) . There is not even a hint of lo fi bluesy garage punk here. In it's place are polished low key songs with pop, country and Memphis soul influence. All the songs deal with various aspects of heartbreak, from the mournful to bittersweet.Although not a great record, there are some great songs here (""I Don't Care"" and ""As Long"" are two highlights). One thing that also stands out that you could not really appreciate over the Oblivian's squal is that Greg Oblivian (or Greg Cartwright as he now prefers) has a great soulful voice that fits prefectly with the material."
3,"Flavor is not very ""Peach""y",The flavor only slightly resembled a peach. It tasted more like the pit instead of the fleshy fruit.
5,The best book for part-time/full-time gambler!,"Hey, I've read so many books over gambling, for now I can't remember how many. Unless I read that one, I always thought they were the same with different autors.That book changed my opinion. I have been a gambler for 15 years now and I found so many new tips, I could'nt believe my eyes.This is not a how-to-play-casino-games book. It's a book teaching you the most important: how to play as a winner and always leave ""as a winner"". Take the money and run is a modern principe in casino's books. That one goes further.It made me change, I hope, forever, my thoughts about what is really a fun and winning way to go to casino.For the price of a Mcdo trio, don't let all these good advices run away from you."
3,A good first book,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. There were parts that seemed rather contrived, but overall, I liked the interplay of reality and myth, psychosis and sanity. I think that this could be a good starting point for a *small* series of books about the Summer Country--maybe not the same characters though. Parts of this book made me cry and others made me laugh out loud.I enjoyed this book and will look for other books by this author."
1,OH GOD HELP,"This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. I could not put it down because I was fascinated by the levels of badness this book could reach. Every time I thought that it was as bad as writing could possibly get, it got worse! The premise of this book is that a psychotic unlikeable character discovers that she really comes from a magical realm, the summer country, and for some reason this means that everyone in the summer country wants to impregnate her. That is it. That is the entirety of the plot. If this appeals to you then by all means read this book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Very much to the supernatural romance end of the spectrum, complete with knights in flanno. Not cheesy though, think Amber style skullduggery throughout, with magic, not platonic reality warping superpowers. It is bearable inasmuch as it is not of the 'so girly your teeth will rot' style, by any stretch of the imagination. A little of the horror thriller, almost, at times."
1,Warning~ Book Contains Triggers,"Not only is this book poorly written, (as if by a teenaged boy who can't watch enough b-rated horror movies), but it is also full of violence against women that triggers on misogyny. FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SUFFERED ANY ABUSE AT ALL, THIS IS NOT A BOOK TO READ!!! The author seems to find some sadistic pleasure in brutalizing his main character."
5,A Twist on a Classic Theme,"The Summer Country, automatically I thought of Aurthurian times-Queen Guinevere, Lancelot..but no. This novel has so much more. You cannot predict the outcome of this book, nor comprehend what it is about until you pick it up and read it.Maureen Pierce cannot escape Buddy Johnson. He raped her body, mind, and soul. Her sister, Jo, is someone she hates almost as much as Buddy; but to save the man she loves, she'll have to become her.The Summer Country is a book rich in magic, mystery, seduction, and overcomming fears. I can't wait for Hetley's next novel."
3,Informative but a bit of a whitewash,"The book is very interesting and very informative on Syrian politics of the past 50 years. However, when it comes to Israeli and American role it substitutes a complete waste of printed space. The author makes such spectacular conclusions on Israeli and American policy in the Middle East that at some places it just goes overboard with some quite idiotic revelations. I am really hoping that the author has realized this.My recommendation is to read all the Asad portion and not pay too much attention to American/Israeli part especially if one knows some Middle East History."
2,"Thick, thick, thick.","Highly detailed concerning its subject, but I had to quit reading halfway through as there were so many murders of the players, that Idon't see who could be left. Not a good book, as I am sure there areothers that could do a better job."
3,Dated,"Claiborne's guidbooks are well written and can be very helpful for those cruising the ICW. That being said, this book was last updated in 2005 so the navigation information is out of date. You are better off getting your data from a number of more up to date websites."
3,Skip this Savitri,"Holst was a great devotee of Hind mythology, and his chamber opera Savitri was the best thing he did in that vein. I've loved it for forty years, and the classic performance under Imogen Holst, the composer's daughter, is out on London/Decca with the amazing Janet Baker and Robert Tear. compared to it, this performance is clumsy and awkwardly sung by the female lead."
3,Good Product Service Problems,"I have had this server up and running for about three weeks now. The unit runs as advertised and is pretty fast. It was pretty easy to configure and the configuration wizard was well designed.The biggest problem is that the unit arrived without a power cable and some other parts. I called the manufacturer and was told the parts would be shipped to me. They failed to arrive. I called back again and was told again the parts would ship. They still have not arrived and I am giving up hope. I was able to find replacements and purchased them at my cost. If service on such a small issue is so hard, I am not sure what would happen on larger issues.I like the product, but I am very disappointed in the quality of shipping and support."
4,Engine Company Ops,"This book goes to the basic essence of engine company operations, fire suppression. It does so clearly and with clean-lined illustrations. From great over-views of fireground operations down to gate valve connnections, this text shows its strength in simplicity. If you want fire suppression theory or an in-depth study of tactics read Norman's Fire Officer's Handbook of Tactics. If you a good primer for an engine company this is it!"
3,Balanced warning,"While the shipping time was much faster than promised, HOW HARD IS IT to include the total price on the invoice? Despite 2 attempts to get a detailed invoice for reimbursement/ tax purposes, none has been provided. A customer could create their own invoice, but this one is not willing to risk audit and jail time because the shipper doesn't follow good business practices.The text itself is fairly straight forward, perhaps with a bit of East Coast bias. Not completely up to date on detailed technical matters (ie: hi-rise pack vs garden pack vs Cleveland roll vs driveway drop), but certainly a great introduction to the material.If you value true customer service from a human rather than a 'bot, avoid any version of 'SharpTextBooks': as in ""s_r_books"" & ""Sharp_books"", emails to which were answered by the parent company.Next time I'll pay full price for a text fulfilled by the publisher: the small savings weren't worth the lingering headache."
5,"Legendary band, poor CD production","If you're reading about Absolution, I don't need to tell you how influential of a band they were. I believe this CD has pretty much every song they wrote, but it's thrown together so carelessly. They didn't go to any source tapes. Well, maybe the rough soundboard tapes were masters. The 7 inch they put out is a transfer of the 7 inch. Clicks and all. The beginning of one of those songs is cut off. The four songs from that release are spread out among other tracks of varying sound quality. I know they professionally recorded Endless Game. I recorded it off the radio long ago. Only a lo-fi live version is included here.Man, this band deserves SUCH better treatment. But it's all there is."
4,Excellent,"This was my first autobiography to read about the life of Custer and it was well worth the time spent reading it.Mr Wert's research was very extensive so he was able to bring to light some fasinating things about Custer's life, and particularly his love affair with his wife Libbie.If there is a negative about this book it is the great amount of time spent covering the Civil War battles, but the Civil War is Mr Wert's area of expertise and I do enjoy reading about that period of American History.Both the positives and the negatives are discussed about this very controversal figure leaving the reader to decide for himself what history will ultimately have to say about George Armstrong Custer."
3,nothing truly new but very readable,"Jeffry Wert's biography on George Custer adds another book on already heavy load on this historical military leader whose main claim to fame was that he got himself and his command wiped out by the Indians. Wert's book proves to be well written, nicely researched and very readable. But I think Wert feel bit too sympathetic toward his subject, mildly whitewashing many of Custer's gross sins both as a man and as a commander. Outside of that, the book doesn't add much to the Custer lore. For novice Custer reader this would be a good start (first of many). For veteran Custer reader, it won't add much more then what you already know so you can let your money make your decision on if this book is worth your while."
5,A great read....,"I have read most of Jeffry Wert's novels and this one does not disappoint. Written with heart and gusto, Custer is a page turner. The author is well versed and prepared when writing his books, being careful not to make assumptions or ""tell it his way"" like other authors have done in the past. Mr. Wert's books are those that can be re-read again and again with out it feeling like your reading a textbook. Well Done!!!"
4,Excellent Customer Service,"I recently purchased a copy of Adobe GoLive 6 (electronic license) from AngelExTech.com. They promptly delivered the serial number for registration and were very willing to assist me if I had any technical issues (which I didn't). I would recommend using this company to anyone looking for this software or any other package they offer.B. LoweryWebmaster, WebIce, Inc."
3,carousel,"Carousel Memories does not have the luster that I had expected. The music is not as clear as I would have liked, however, it does have some good qualities that make it worth while to listen."
1,"This ""book"" is terrible!","I fear I can't adequately describe how awful this book is. I use the term ""book"" loosely. It's a bunch of photocopied pages bound together, including many typos and some handwritten corrections. The information it contains wouldn't fill the head of a pen. If anyone else is thinking of buying this book, do yourself a favor and don't. I only wished someone had written a review to warn me. If you just have to see for yourself, email me and I'll send you my copy, gladly."
4,nice,"This album was okay. It had that neo/R&B vibe. I really haven't heard of Debra but when I heard her sing ""Message in the Music"" I decided to give her a try. My favorite songs were ""Surrender"", ""Jesus"", and ""Because of Your Love"". I definately thought she could do without those interludes. I don't know if those were her kids but it was very annoying. But overall this was a decent album."
4,Not Quite the Newcomer,"Debra Killings may be a new gospel artist, but she is definitely not a newcomer to the industry. Debra has done background vocals for several major Atlanta acts including Outkast, Monica, Goodie Mob, and TLC. I recognized her voice years ago and always wondered if she would ever do her own album. I surprisingly found out she was doing gospel instead of going the route of her previous ""co-workers/collaborators"". Anyway, she is definitely doing her thing on Surrender and I wish her much success!"
1,Not much better than your laptop's internal speakers,"I purchased this item on sale for $54 and I STILL RETURNED IT. I read the reviews carefully before purchasing, however, I was very disappointed with the sound quality. I used the speakers to listen to acoustic guitar recordings on my laptop -- primarily treble-rich music. When I listened to the guitar music with the speakers attached, the sound quality was almost identical to that from the laptop internal speakers alone (i.e., there was no difference). I tried the speakers on two different laptops -- An apple Macbook purchased in 2006 and a Dell Inspiron purchased in 2004. Both of these laptops come with internal speakers that rival the sound of the TravelSound 500 speakers. I imagine that for other types of music (e.g., rock or pop) that have a wider spectrum of tone, the speakers would make more of a difference, however, I would not recommend these speakers unless you have an older laptop with really bad internal speakers."
3,Close but no cigar,"I had this on my wish list and received it for Xmas. I wanted it because the speakers on my Thinkpad are really insufficient, and it seemed like this was exactly what I needed. I'm slightly disappointed however.1) It took me a little while to figure out how to get it to work, and the instructions were of little help. I can dismiss that as me just being a little slow, but still, a some text in the instructions would've helped.2) Because my Thinkpad's lid is not flat, the way that the speakers snap onto the top of it is not very secure. It comes off very easily.3) The sound seems to crackle quite a bit (although not constantly). I'm listening to the radio through the internet, and the sound quality seems inconsistent.So, in theory, this is exactly what I wanted, but I don't know if these issues will just annoy me every time I pick up my laptop."
5,If you have the money to spend THESE ARE WELL WORTH IT,"These speakers are incredible. I've had them for at least two years, played them hours upon hours, dropped them many times and they still sound fantastic!!!!!! These speakers are small, lightweight, yet they are very clear and have an amazing range from lows to highs, and comes with a subwoofer output for those extra vibrating reality-making lows. Let me tell you, as a musician with an extremely particular choosiness for sound, these speakers are incredible. Loud for their size too. I specifically came on here to review them because of how impressed I am with them. I am glad to have found a product that is well made. In durability, sound, and overall quality. Thank you creative."
2,What a bad choice,"What a bad choiceAfter enjoying for many years the Sony Cyber-shot DCS-P30 1.3MP Digital Camera without missing a shot, I thought that the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H5 7.2MP Digital Camera was and upgrade.What a failure. It's just a bulky camera."
3,A little disappointed,Takes awesome outside pictures. I'm a little upset about the inside shots. Flash is too bright even though I have done everything instructed to make it darker. Pics are out of focus when used without the flash with dim light. Had it a couple of months and had to send in for repair due to an internal computer issue but the turn around time was great ( about 7 days). I guess the bottom line is that I am keeping it but would not buy it again.
5,Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 Digital Camera,"This was the best money I ever spent for a digital camera. Easy to use and makes the greatest photos. This camera is so simple to use, all the features are user friendly and is loaded with extra features compared to other digital cameras I had looked at. Amazon shopping experience was great!!"
5,Sony H5 is a must have camera,"Powerful flash, mega zoom w/image stabilization, large lcd, good battery life, excellent picture quality, but video resolution is not 720x480. With LCD on, I was able to get over two hours of shots & videos. If you use AUTO setting, about 20% of your photos will be out of focus. So learn how to use the camera features. You really don't need a horse shoe because theflash is very strong. Stop wasting your time researching. Buy Sony H5 and you won't regret it. Items recommended: 1)HORI PSP screen proctector to protect this huge LCD. 2) Sony 2GB high speed duo ($63 on-line), 3)extra rechargeable batteries and 4)Sony LCJ-HC carrying case. Good luck."
3,"Sony DSC-H5 : nice features, but poor reliability and support","I got the DSC-H5 in 2006, and liked the features and performance, except for the slow shutter lag, but even that could be partially offset with prefocusing by pressing the shutter button halfway. Not any more. The switch for the pre-focus no longer works since about a year ago, and Sony refuses to acknowledge that there is a defective part - even though hundreds of owners have complained online and to the company about this problem, caused by a bad switch. So I recommend you buy cameras from Canon or Nikon, and boom boxes from Sony. They do not make reliable cameras, and worse, do not cover repairs due to flawed parts even when they are told about it by many angry customers."
1,Sony Cybershot 7.2 MP camera died right after 1 year warranty expired,"Suddenly, while traveling, this Sony Cybershot 7.2 MP stopped working. It was exactly 1 year after purchase, right after the warranty expired. Very disappointing.An electronic problem causes a complete freezing-up right after the shutter button is pushed, resulting in a blank black viewer. After it finally releases from the freeze, no picture has been taken.Repair work costs more than to replace camera, of course. I will think twice before buying Sony camera again.As a photographer, I have owned many different cameras. Never have had a complete malfunction on a camera ever, except in a used Nikon I bought from the guys at the B&H; Used Camera Dept in NYC.This Sony should have been better and should have lasted much longer. My old Olympus digital lasted at least five years with no problem."
5,Great Camera!,Awesome camera...even more awesome are the pictures it takes.Truly impressed at what Sony has done this time around with their product line.
1,"Don't waste your money, it's junk.",These are nice cameras but they have a serious (fatal) problem with the shutter button. The button falls apart which renders the camera useless. This has happened twice with the camera I own. The first time it occurred under warranty and Sony fixed the problem although it occurred on vacation in France which was a bummer. Now the exact same problem has reoccurred and Sony wants $171.00 to fix it. I'd save my money or buy a Nikon or Canon. If you'll notice this is not the only review that mentions this problem.
5,I love this camera! It is GREAT!,"This is my 3rd D.camera. I did an extensive research. I wanted to get a camera I could handle with one hand, not too heavy, yet a large tele range. The lens is really great. I get VERY sharp photos! I have a lot to learn on how to use extra features, but haven't missed on auto setting yet."
2,I Will Never Buy Another Sony,"This camera was surely not worth the $600 I paid for it. The battery system is horrible due to low capacity, and the delay it takes to actually snap the picture is infuriating. A lot of my closer photos or photos with any kind of movement turn out blurry. Everytime I use this camera I regret buying it. Don't waste your money parents! Buy a Nikkon or a Canon and get the picture snapped at the moment you actually want it snapped when you're shooting your children!"
2,Not all that impressive...,"I had been looking for a camera with 10-12x optical zoom, image stabalization and 5+ MP. I reviewed Sony based on the feedback from other customers and on actual performance. The snaps in some modes were amazing (forgive my layman approach, for I am not a PRO), but overall I felt it was rather overprized. The ergonomics - average. The CCD imager defect does exist. Controls can be confusing for first-timers. The viewfinder is awkwardly modeled....Overall, not the kind of product we know Sony for. I chose a Canon S3 IS over it and am most satisfied with it."
3,Good but no soo Much,"The camera take excllent pictures, no question about that, but weight a lot in comparation whit other cameras, the batterys dont have a long work`s time. amazon sold the camera with a memory stick pro, that dont be used wiht this camera, now i have to buy another memory."
3,not satisfied as i was with h5,"battery back up is not so god, and charging also took a lot of time.the dial to change the mode , got changed accidently a lot of times and the picture went all blurry .very satisfied from the size and the weight aspect."
4,Good cam for the money,"I wish i had waited for the new product that is coming out. But dollar for dollar, this camera does what it is supposed to and does it well. I'm not a photographer by any means, what little I know through trial, error, advice, accidental discovery and sheer luck has helped me through the ins and outs of this nice little pro-sumer cam. I'm taking shots I wouldn't normally try, because of the manual settings available. If you're a little leery about dropping some money on a camera, choose well and you'll be glad you did. I think half the fun is learning w/ this camera."
4,Good choice,"This product is simply great. The picture clarity is terrific. The optical zoom handles very well too. This is addition to the large LCD screen makes it a great experience to capture photos.I have really enjoyed this product so far.The only downside I have for this one is its large size.Nervertheless, it is a great product"
4,Pretty good camera,The pictures are very nice and the camera has lots of features I have yet to figure out. But I was still somewhat dissapointed with the lag between pushing the putton and getting the shot. My $200 Fuji is just as fast if not a little faster. Trying to take pictures of a two year old is challenging enough.
5,Just When You Thought the H-1 Ruled!,"This an absolutely fantastic camera. My wife has an H-1 and the first difference she noticed was how much lighter my new H-5 was. That's a big deal for lugging a camera around as physically large as this one is. But you know what?...There is no substitute for a quality large lens. I do a lot of macro work and this is the best non SLR digital for macros I have ever tried. And the zoom movie thing is a big improvement over its predecessor. And the best part for me was that I found this gem for a steal price of $150 (original box, all acces, 2 gig card, case) on Craig's List. So the deals are out there and this wonderful camera is my best ever score."
4,Do Not Order The Memory Stick Pro,"Camera arrived on time and seems to work ok. Test shots were excellent. Will review in detail after I have used it.However, the 1GB Memory Stick Pro that is recommended with this camera WILL NOT Work nor will it fit into the slot as it is incompatable with the DSC-H5. You must order and use the ""Memory Stick Duo"" (a shorter stick) according to the manual. Amazon should've confirmed this before recommending the Memory Stick Pro. Now I have wait a little longer to take more than the 8 shots the camera will hold."
4,Thunder Road,Great picture full of exciting car chase scenes. It thrilled me as a kid and brings back that feeling today even with knowing that so many scenes are full of malarkey.
4,Clasic Robert Mitchum,Worth having in the classic collection but I remember it as being much better. Fifty years will do that.
4,ThunderRoad,I enjoy watching the video over and over. Maybe because it takes me back to the days of the 57 Ford Thunderbird. Only thing I didn't like was it being black and white. I guess color has spoiled us. Still a good movie now as it was then.
4,Love That 'Hillbilly Film Noir',"Someone once labeled this film ""hillybilly film noir."" I think that's a great description of this movie. This is about the good 'ole boys racing their souped-up 1950s Fords around country roads, running moonshine and trying to evade both cops and gangsters.In fact, I wish they had more of those chase scenes because, even with primitive special-effects, they were fun to watch. The ending chase would have been longer, if I had my way.Mitchum is fun to watch in here, too. He just looked like a rugged guy, a ""man's man,"" as they say. His kid brother Jim made his film debut in here and wasn't bad for a beginner. He and another beginner, singer Keely Smith, are a bit wooden but passable as actors. Keely also had an interesting face.I think this is one of those films that gets better with each viewing. Highly recommended."
3,"3.5, maybe...","A slow-moving crime melodrama about a family of old-fashioned, backwoods moonshiners being muscled out by big city gangsters. Robert Mitchum, in sort of a James Dean turn, sleepy-eyes his way through with his usual mix of menace and charm; Edie Adams plays his long-suffering nightclub-singer girlfriend, and gets a few vocal numbers in, too. (Adam's fans will definitely want to check this film out... those who don't quite get her charms will probably find her irritating, or simply adequate in her role.) The most interesting piece of casting, however is Mitchum's son (!) who looks just like him, and plays his younger brother, a weird but brilliant choice. This film was okay, but not great."
3,not too bad for an old 50's flick,"I thought ""Thunder Road"" was a great flick. It reminded me a lot of the old Jimmy Dean movies, only Mitchum wasn't quite as cool."
2,Skipping along the road.,"I bought it new, not used but it had skipsat the beginning then finally smoothed out.Sissy"
2,Blunder Road,This is what I thought was a fantastic movie as I remeber it from my younger days. I just had to see it again. Well I saw it again and it wasn't the block buster I remebered it to be. The acting was terrible and the car chases were not that exciting. I can see why it is not shown on any television stations anymore.
5,never thought I would find it,Thunder Road starring Robert Mitchum was a movie that I had tried to find for many years without any luck. Amazon was there for me....great movie I can now enjoy at anytime.
5,Thunder Road,I ordered this for my husban for christmas. He could not wait to watch it even though he has seen it before. It was a good movie to add to our collection.
4,Works,"REALLY needs a redesign for the screw located underneath the power box. Make sure you place a gasket, or something to absorb vibration around the metal meets metal surfaces. This should come with something like this. A piece of cut your own automotive gasket material works great for this. Just started using a couple months ago. runs 12 hrs a day. So far great. Soon when my hair is short I'll make a full report...."
3,A lot of work to install,"This duct booster fan is a lot of work to install. I prefer the ""CAN Max Fan"". It includes a speed contoller, is easer to install and pushes more air down the duct. It is also more expensive."
2,EVEN THE PROMO IS INCORRECT,"I HAVE NOT VIEWED THESE TWO DVD'S HOWEVER IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ACCEPT THE INORMATION SERIOUSLY. ON THE JACKET OF BOTH DVD'S THE PROMO STATES QUOTE ""FROM THE 1943 ROMANIAN OVERTHROW OF ANTONESCU"". MARSHALL ANTONESCU WAS OVERTHROW IN AUGUST 1944 AN EVENT WHICH CONSIDERABLY CHANGED THE COURSE OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR A FACT NOT GENERALLY RECOGNISED IN THE WESTERN WORLD.Campaign in The Balkans PT 2Campaign in The Balkans PT 1"
3,"Knowledgable, Articulate, Angry",Kozol has done a fine job of documenting one dimension of our educational system. He doesn't have much in terms of useful recommendations.
2,"Well, he's good at something...","Kozol does something extraordinarily well in this book, and that is to point out all that is going wrong with our schools. There's a point, though, when we must stop agonizing over what is wrong with the system, and make some real proposals on how to make things better. Anyone is capable of doing what Kozol did in this book, which is to simply point out the many pitfalls of our schools. In order for this to be considered a good book, he needs to complete the circle and make some recommendations about how to fix it. Simply complaining will get us nowhere, even if we complain extraordinarily well."
2,A Great Argument for Vouchers,"Kozol spews his normal emotional stuff but fails to get to the underlying problem: government-provided goods always have at least 2 out of 3 features: they cost a lot, they are low in quality, and they harm the poor. Government education wins the Trifecta: it does all three.If someone said that lower income people who get food stamps should have to spend their food stamps in government run supermarkets, we would see the idiocy: government has no edge in producing or distributing food. Well, now we have government giving education stamps but saying they have to be spent in government run education stores. Kozol has no right to be shocked."
3,"Move to Pennsylvania, then.","[...] indicates that for 2006, the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia School Districts spent [...] per student. This is vs. an average expenditure of [...] per student for the state as a whole.In case anyone hasn't figured it out, the title is sarcastic - anyone that moves to PA for the quality of the education in the big cities will be sorely disappointed, despite the higher expenditures per student. Throwing more money at the problem does exactly nothing............actually, the argument can be made that it makes things worse.The author should think about including this data in the next edition."
2,Fine tape if you're a professional dancer,"Where in the description of this DVD does it mention ""must be professional dancer to attempt any of this choreography""? It claims to teach you each move slowly and then gradually add them together. In the first two minutes, Paula asked me to do the Charleston! No explanation, no slo-mo. I assumed ""Intermediate level"" meant fitness level. Don't waste your money on it unless you have extensive dancing experience."
3,Its okay,"Not as fun as I expected. Thought it would be more exercise, but felt like activity level was very mild."
2,Too advanced,"If you are a dancer you may find this fun, but if you just want a good workout, this is not for you. The moves are too advanced, and you have to spend time learning the moves before you are able to get any significant aerobic benefit from them. Not to mention you need a lot of space to do the routine.For a good workout, you might want to look elsewhere."
3,"Fun to dance, not exactly workout material","For a good dancer, this would be a good way to workout and learn a routine. However, for an average person, don't expect to be shown the steps. It is fun, but had to keep rewinding so much that it didn't keep up my heart rate. Even after doing the video for several weeks, I couldn't learn the routine well enough to consider it a workout. But, I would recommend it to more skilled dancers because it would be a fun routine, and Paula is fun to dance with."
1,workout,I have not found a work out tape of katy Smiths that I like. i do like the Yoga one from her.
4,You will sweat!,"I just bought this video because I had abdominal surgury a few weeks ago and could not keep up my high energy kick boxing schedule (I've been too tired!). I also do not get to go out dancing like I used to, so I thought this would be fun. I was right, this is fun. I watched the video several times before trying the moves and it is taking some time to learn the steps (I don't dare look in the mirror!). Even though I have only gotten through the first section, I am looking forward to completing the video. It gets me warmed up quickly without over taxing and Paula is upbeat and cheerful. I feel happy when I'm done and enjoy the somewhat funky dance moves. My 8 year old daughter likes to watch it too!PS You will need a large area to get a good workout. Also this workout is hard on the ankles."
1,Doesn't break down the steps,"Paula is a great dancer, but she does not spend enough time breaking down the dance steps on her DVD. I eventually got frustrated and quit, so I never got a workout. I'm a Personal Trainer and Group Fitness Instructor and have been doing aerobics for years but this workout is not for the average exerciser. If you are into dance and pick up dance step very quickly this may be okay for you."
4,"Cuing, editing, & insets make choreography easy to learn","Paula makes intermediate dance steps accessible to the beginner dancer! This tape is very much like taking a beginning to intermediate jazz/funk class. With gradual increases up to tempo, corner-of-the screen insets showing Paula from the back so you can ""follow along"" (as most wallflowers tend to do in their first couple of classes), and excellent camera shots, the beginner is given ample opportunity to pick up on her funky moves. The choreography does require a bit of sliding around, which is hard in my carpeted apartment, but it is still very do-able.The toning section is great, but requires some rewinding for the beginner, since most of Paula's instructions on how to do the stretch correctly were dubbed over the dancers already doing the stretch.Great for a beginner (with rhthym) who wants to learn classy jazz/funk, or for the advanced student who has taken some time away from dance and wants to get back into the groove!"
4,Broke a sweat and had fun!,"So Paula isn't the most peppy instructor but she's an awsome choreographer. Yes, the moves are NOT for beginners but if you have a little dance experience, some patience and you relax and let go you will notice the steps flow together easily. The warm up was great and it has authentic dancer toning (plies) and stretching! If you also watch the background dancers they are not only eye candy but they are individuals who give you ideas on how to spice up and vary the routine a little."
2,Cardio Dance not too cardio,"I am a former dancer and I thought this video would be high energy with fun and easy steps to get the heart rate up. Boy was I wrong! Its got 3 small combinations in it that are semi easy to follow, with one big routine in the end. There was no warm-up or cool down, which should be required when working your muscles. In addition, you need a lot of space to work in, so you average living room probably won't work.I sweat a little, but never got even close to a high heart rate or losing my breath. I would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for real cardio. If you have dance experience and are looking for something to do, maybe this is for you."
5,Give it a Day and You'll Agree-FUN FUN FUN,"I have never had a dance class in my life, and I started doing this video and immediately felt frustrated. HOWEVER, I decided to stop at each section and learn the footwork until I had the steps down. The first time through took me about 2 hours, BUT the next time I worked out, I had the steps and I added my own groove and felt like I had a GREAT workout! Paula is SO much fun, she's just a cutie and really does make it a good time, you don't even feel like you're working out, just doing a fun dance routine. For someone who has never danced like a cheerleader before, this was an absolute BLAST! You can do it, just give it a day and BREAK THE STEPS DOWN FIRST...DON'T GET FRUSTRATED!!"
2,Really Disappointed,"I've been a fan of Paula Abdul for a long time. I really looked forward to this routine, and I LOVE to dance (and have had a fair amount of dance instruction). Not only did I not get a great workout, it just really wasn't that fun and was difficult to follow at times. It seemed a bit Richard Simmonsy (no offense, Richard!) in the quality. I get a better workout from just bopping to a CD. But the stretching at the end is of high quality."
4,Just plain Fun!,"This workout was really fun. It was a nice change from hardcore workouts like kickboxing or weightlifting. I am pretty literate in the dance department, but even I did find it a bit of a challenge to learn the moves at first. Most workout tapes start with one move and keep adding on as you get the first move. Paula does go FAST. I would not recommed this to someone just starting to workout. But, the dancing is interesting and you don't really feel like you are exercising. This is a great video for a change up."
3,For an intermediate student of dance,"I bought this for my self and daughter and this is not a dvd which is easy to follow unless you are already familiar with the grape vine steps, box step, mambo, or military steps you'll find it challenging and must be willing to play this section over and over until you get it down. Also , she give you no step by step instructions to get you up to speed. I feel we will have to start our workout education with a different instructor on an other dvd before we're ready for this . Another note ,start with the cool down and stretch out first!"
2,Not For Beginners,"This tape is not for beginners who are starting a weight loss program. Although all of Paula's moves are dance moves, I did not think they were easy to pick up. It is a great tape for people who are really in good physical shape. The background was great, Paula and her dancers were great, and the music was great, but it is not a good tape for those who have finally gain the energy, willpower, and courage to loss weight."
3,"Fun dance moves, but takes up too much space in the house","I was a little disappointed with this video, because they do not tell you on the cover how much room you are going to need to do it! In my living room, it's just not practical. It seems like it'd be fun if there were room to really get into the workout. For now I'll stick to Denise Austin."
2,challenging,This has some great steps or dances IF you are a dance major or something. I have been dancing for many years and still find this quite challenging to learn the steps. The intention of the video was to be applauded but it is still very complicated to learn as a person just trying to workout.
2,Not for novices!,"I bought this video knowing that I don't have natural dance talent but thinking I could just follow along and enjoy the exercise. But, I couldn't follow her first step and even where she does have instructions, they aren't very helpful if you don't already know dance steps.For the experienced dancer, or someone with natural talent, this is probably a fun video."
2,Frustrating,"Different strokes for different folks. I found this workout tape to be extremely frustrating because it's seems to be more interested in looking cool than giving a good workout. I thought the steps were very difficult to master (and I tried, oh, how I tried!), and Paula's background dancers were too annoying to warrant rewinding the tape to see how the ""follow me"" Paula did the footwork. The only things saving this tape from a completely rotten tomato are the lower body firming segment at the end and the aforementioned ""follow me"" Paula, a window in the lower corner of the screen in which Paula does the steps as though you're dancing a row behind her. They should have kept that window up a little longer through each dance sequence."
2,Very short workout,This is ok. The music is alright. The best thing about the workout is the ten minutes of leg toning at the end. The moves are cute but once you learn them the workout becomes monotonous and boring.
2,Disappointing,"I was a little disappointed because I like the types of moves she does. Really she just isn't a very good teacher in this dvd so it takes a few uses to ""get it"" and be able to do the moves with her."
2,Very bad instructor,"I've been doing aerobic-dance classes for four years now and I thought I'll give this routine a try. She SUCKS as a fitness and dance instructor. I do not doubt her ability as a dancer but as far as teaching goes she better quit!! The toning part was ok but the rest of the routine was the worse I've done. She does not count, does not give proper instruction on the steps, moves in very fast tempo too soon. Do not buy, waste of time and money."
2,Workout Isn't Hard Enough,"As a trained dancer, I wanted something fun and dance oriented, yet something to help be burn calories and sweat my butt off! Well, the routine was fun, but the workout itself wasn't as nearly as challenging as I had hoped. I definitely didn't burn the calories that I had anticipated. If you are a beginner, this would be a great workout. If you are intermediate/advanced like myself, skip it and don't waste your money."
1,Useless for beginners!,"It's useles for beginners. It does not show step by step. Even when I slowed down the speed of the DVD, I still could not follow her dancing. What a waste of money."
3,Cardio Dance,A little too complicated for me but otherwise a great workout and looks like a lot of fun once you catch on
1,"What fun, I'm on the bed staring at the cieling","I did this video a long while ago and havn't attempted to look at it again. The moves go by quickly and are impossible to catch. The rewind button was not meant for this kind of usage. After a while, I just crawled on my bed and stared at the cieling because even watching them dance wasn't fun."
4,a semi-hard excercise,"This DVD contains a good excercise with dance moves. It includes good workout for legs, some for shoulders but none for stomach or the back. It's a bit hard on the knees. The music is good, the dancers are good and not overly 'excited' like you see in some videos/DVDs. Skipping back is easy and this is good when you did not quite get the moves. Paula does her job very well and the stretches are nice 'tho a bit short. You do need some space to do all the moves efficiently and a carpet-free floor to avoid twisting your knees. I would have wished for two different routines but it only contains one. To break a lot of sweat I'd recommend to buy the Cindy Crawford excercise video!"
2,This Is Ridiculous,"If you can actually get the moves in this DVD down, you have a good workout in store for you. If you have little dance experience and won't know what Paula's talking about when she tells you to do a ""bus-stop"" as if it's something you do everyday, you may be in for a disapointment. Although Paula's cues are perfectly timed and this can be fun once you get it down, she never breaks any of the moves down, or explains how to do them properly. It can get very frustrating if you're a beginner, or have little dance experience. I love workout DVDs and have been using them for years and this, in my opinion, was a waste of money."
5,I love this dance routine,"I can't decide what I like more, the cute dance routine just for what it is, a fun expressive dance, or the cardio benefits. I love to dance, and I exercise every day, I am always on the lookout for video programs that will keep me motivated and entertained, and this video does the job! At first I had to replay each section again and again to get the moves and the form right, now I know it by heart and it is very rewarding!"
2,Counting anyone??,"Okay I'll give Paula props she's an amazing dancer and a really good choreographer but whew she stinks as a teacher! I danced for about five years and even taught a few classes ( though granted not in this style) and I can't imagine teaching any student any routine without counting/calling out the beat for them at least the first time. Paula rarely counts and rarely calls moves. I'm having fun but I must admit I am pretty frustrated, the first time I didn't even get through the DVD. If you are not really good at dance don't bother, if however you're studying to be a Lakers girl, well here ya go!"
5,"VERY SURPRISED, IT WAS NOT AS HARD TO LEARN AS I THOUGHT","i am a 25 year old male, who is about 230 lbs plus, and i had no problem learning and following the steps, i learned them in about 2 days. i love this video, it goes great with my weight loss program, i definitely like cardio dance better, over paula's previous video, get up and dance. this video seems that she went to the basics and i love it, i have already lost weight with this video. dont be fooled, this video is hard work(not the steps, but the workout) u will be sweating in no time. i do this tape at least once a day, sometimes twice. she keeps it fun, and upbeat, by far the best workout video i have seen."
3,Good workout but not as good as her first workout.,"I bought this because I loved her ""Get Up and Dance"" workout. I've done this workout several times but I don't like it very well. It takes quite a few workouts to get the routine down and it's very hard on your knees and back (whether you are on carpet or not). I was very disappointed in this tape vs. her other tape. The steps are not explained well; the pace is fast to begin with and continues to increase; the instructional box in the corner is worthless; and she seems to target well-advanced dancers. It's very fun to do, once you get the routine down, but you'll end up on your nose if you have two left feet."
1,not like her other dance video,I don't know how anyone can get the routine down unless these moves are something you learn prior. It is nevy taxy and complicated and not broken down well. I liked her first video... but this one doesn't compare. It also mentions that it needs to be done on a non carpeted area.. in a large area. Not ideal for a home workout.
4,great workout if you are restarting a fitness program,"I bought this video because I have danced ballet for over 20 years as an amateur but have stopped doing any kind of exercise due to personal reasons. I have been wanting to go back to exercising but I have not been able to find/make time for that. I purchased some aerobics videos but aerobics and step type of exercising usually gets me bored. Due to my dancing background, I was very happy to find this video which combines fitness and dancing. It is fun to do. The steps are easy to learn and follow. It makes you sweat and get into shape real quick. However, after you start getting into shape, the exercises on the video become low impact and you need to combine it with higher impact videos or alternate them. But on the whole, I recommend this video."
1,Not for beginners!!,I bought this tape to learn to dance while getting a good work out and it turned out to be so fast paced that I found I was just standing there watching the tv most of the time!
4,Need a lot of space,"This tape is lots of fun, but you need A LOT of floor space. It's hard to do in my little apartment."
2,Paula is not a teacher,"I gave this two stars because I like the stretching cool-down segment.The problem is that Paula is not a teacher. She is a dancer and choreographer who is used to working with people who know dance terminology and pick up steps quickly. This is not me. I have done quite a few aerobic dance workouts and pick up the steps in those pretty well,so I know I am not completely dancing impaired, but I just couldn't get this. There is not enough explanation of the steps and transitions. I got frustrated and spent much time talking to the screen, ""I didn't get that. I can't do that. Whatever Paula."" I spent a lot of time just stepping side to side, waiting for something I could do. I wound up making up my own workout and only doing the cool down on this DVD.I was hoping for a fun workout and was disappointed. Paula is just not an instructor."
3,"Workout is OK, BUT...","You practically need a dance studio to do the moves the way they are demostrated. If live in an apartment, this is NOT the DVD for you. I had to find out the hard way, now I'm stuck with it! Other than the space issue, it's pretty good."
5,Fun and easy with enthusiastic Paula,"This workout still rates as my favorite of all time. It's fun and easy, especially with the instruction box in the corner so you can follow Paula and her dancers move for move. The beginning features tips for working out, a warm-up and stretch, then learning the moves. You put the routine all together and afterward a cool down and another stretch. I reccomend it to any Paula fan I really hope Paula continues to make fitness videos, I will be the first to buy it!"
2,not instructional,"Unless you're an experienced dancer, I wouldn't recommend this video. there aren't any explanations. it's just following dance moves you're expected to already know"
3,Beware Beginners!,"I figured since I have a background in dance I would be able to get through this video with no problem. Big mistake. Even the warm-up was for pro dancers. She starts the steps as she calls ""slow"" which means regular pace and then speeds it up to what I call ""maniac"". I seriously don't recommend this video for anyone who has not studied dance. Halfway through the tape I just sat down on my couch and cried. I recommend The Grind Hip Hop workout if you want a energy-packed fun dance workout. Too bad they didn't have any at Suncoast..."
3,Good but fairly dated...,"I'm not going to say that I didn't get a great workout from this program, but as coordinated as I am I found myself floundering. It's fun and a good workout but the moves are dated and it's definitely not for the uncoordinated."
3,"Nice dance steps, not so great workout","I really like doing this video, I love dancing and the steps are challenging enough for me to make it fun, but it doesn't really get my heart rate up. It also seems like it would be too complex for people who don't have any dance experience or don't feel that they are very coordinated. The strength part at the end is very good for your legs, but the dance just doesn't make me sweat enough."
5,it is very fun!,"I really enjoy this tape, it is lots of fun and works all your muscles groups as well. I think I enjoy it and keep coming back to it because this is one of the very few tapes out there that you can actually see that the instructor(Paula) is really having a blast at doing it and that, in a sense, motivates me to relax and have fun--but keep everything tight at the same time!"
2,Lots of complicated dance moves.,"I bought this video for both the cardio workout and the dance. The cover said that she slowly teaches the dance steps. This is an exageration. She flies through the moves, and expects you to catch on or rewind. It will take a lot of patience to rewind that many times and still get any workout. It says Intermediate Level which I wanted in the intensity of the workout, but the moves are advanced. I would recommend looking for something else unless you are really an experiences dancer or have done lots of dance videos."
3,Great Dance Steps With NO Queing,"This is not a hard exercise session. I use it for ""Fun"" days since I like to dance. The teaching style is very dancy - no building up you go right in to it and stop between sections. There are ""supportive"" slides that pop up between steps and interupt the exercise session - you need to be very disceplined and keep stepping in order to get real benefit. One last thing - there is very little queing here - so it takes some time until you learn what comes when and stop being surprised."
3,Tennis scores,"I bought this product because many times my oponent and I forget the scores, mostly after an intense point. The product is good after using on a regular basis. I dont' use it anymore because it is distracting."
4,tennis scorer,"My daughter liked it very much it helped her not to get confused and lost in the game she did not keep it on her but at the back of the court on her towel, which worked very well for her."
5,Great CD!!!,"I didnt like this cd quite as much as the Silver Cord, but it was pretty close. There were some great lyrics and sound and I love Matt's voice. A great cd for any hard rock fan out there."
4,Kasie is an idiot,"'Panic! at the disco'? Are you serious?? TCC sounds NOTHING AT ALL like panic at the disco. I saw that and almost died of laughter. If you like Story of the year, Deftones or 30 seconds to mars, you'll probably like TCC. Panic at the disco...HA, that was classic."
1,Really Terrible.,"The tunes are not so bad. It's the lyrics that kill me. I can't listen to this album because they make my ears hurt. The words are cliched, sad, and fail to be the pretentious emo poetry that they aspire to me. Phrases like, ""The coldest heart can be brought life when it's thrown into the fire of goodbyes,"" could very well be a parody of the genre. Yet it's belted out with all sincerity. It touches on all the stereotypical keywords and fails to make sense. Wake up, wannabe scene kids! This is garbage."
5,Great book,"These books are wonderful this is the fith in a series of 7. The book is great for both older and younger kids I enjoyed all of them immensely, these are great books for Harry Potter fans they are alike in alot of ways and are both books you'll want to read again and again."
4,rememba going down to Cisco's on Friday payday,"I had dis mix cd which included da best cuts on Sublime and 40 oz To Freedom. Played it out in 2002!Faves were: What I Got, Santeria, & Wrong Way. Good memories, good times."
5,Ultimate 90's c.d.,"I bought this c.d. because like a poser I liked the songs on mtv. However when I stuck it in my car's c.d. player I was blown away after each track. There are some songs in life that have a good beat and there are others that carry a good little story to them, these songs carry both, great words great beats on every track. After listing to this c.d. twice you listen to the words so intently that you can sing along with the windows open, and just feel great. Must own c.d. for anyone. Great from beginning to end, a rarity."
4,Good cd overall,"Sublime was a good band that never lived to see their full potential. Their self titled album is their most famous album, filled with such well known songs as ""What I Got"",""Santeria"", and ""Wrong Way"".The album is a mixture of reggae,hip-hop, and some punk, similar to the debut but much, much more focused and less ""jammy"". The spontaneity of the debut will be missed by hardcore fans, and theres just something about the way the songs on it(Ruca,Badfish,DJ's..) gel together, blending different styles of music, that is missing and makes it less fun.They still are a capable band on this release, however, and it still delivers the goods overall."
3,Maybe Worth A Listen,"I'll be honest, I've never thought sublime was all that talented. That being said, this album is still listenable. A few of the songs are mindless, stoner songs, while others provide a great deal of humor.If you're a stoner, you'll love this, if not you'll probably wonder why it's so popular.Best Songs: What I got, Caress me down."
2,worst sublime album,"Hey don't take me wrong. I'm a HUGE sublime fan. I own all their CD's (even lot's of bootlegs and imports), I have two of their videos, posters everything. in fact Sublime is my FAVORITE band. but I just don't really like this album. it doesn't reflect the emotion of the music. it's just all too good of recording. I like to sit back and listen to Robbin The Hood or the Sublime Accoustic album because those show how much of a genius Bradley was. but the self-titled album just isn't my favorite. if you want a Sublime CD get any of the other five. they are all great. just skip on this one. well peace out"
2,Not As Good As It Looks,"This album at your first glance looks like a masterpiece, but after yoou listen tio the entire album, you may think differently. ""Wrong Way"", ""Santeria"", ""What I Got"", and ""April 29, 1992"" are good songs but most of the other fourteen songs are their failed attempts at punk rock. They're not all alternative-reggae. They do also play punk rock-which they should not."
2,"i LOVE sublime, but this one is wwaayy overrated","Sublime was a really good band. I LOVE 40 Oz. To Freedom; that cd is one of the very best cds that i own, but i really think this one is overrated. It does have some good songs, but for the most part, they just arent that great. the good ones are Garden Grove, What I Got, and even that one is not the best in the world, Wrong Way, Santeria, April 29th, and Seed. Those are pretty much the only ones i listen to when i put the CD in. please dont get me wrong and think i am some ignorant person who ""doesnt know sublime at all."" i LOVe the band, but i just dont think this cd is all its cut out to be. If you want an EXCELLENT cd, go buy 40 oz. With the exception of maybe 3 or 4 songs, that entire cd is excellent. skip this one because they play pretty much every good song on the radio like once a day."
2,The band Sublime is not a classic and neither is this CD,"What kind of garbage is this? The beats sound like they are copied off of other ska bands like No Doubt, Sugar Ray and others. Eventhough Sublime came before Limp Bizkit and Sugar Ray, I would rather buy Sugar Ray than this Jamaican beats ripoff. The lead singer died of cocaine overdose in 1996 and that shows that Jamaican/ska bands like Sublime can be gone in a blink of an eye. Sublime tries to rap in Bob Marley style beats, but it fails miserably. The lead singer sounds like he sung in a styrofoam cup. Everbody thinks this band is a classic while it lasted, but this CD is just a headache for the ears. They think they're so cool, they rap about the LA riots in 1992. Big deal. I know Sublime had released four CD's before this last CD, but all of their albums are just cardboard. This bands' last CD is not a classic at all."
3,What the...........?,"Please don't compare these guys to the beatles or hendrix or anything like that. They are not legends. They are an entertaining ska/punk/folk band. Thats it. Good songs, nothing that will stand the test of time"
1,como se dice....retarded?,wholy crap this albem is tottaly rad!!!the lierics are defiantly awesome and the raggay music gets me dancin'!just kidding. this album sucks.
5,R.I.P. Bradley,"With all the talent that Sublime as a whole had, It was the most tragic thing to happen in the rock genre since Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. With Brad's creativity on the mike, and the rest of the group's sound, this CD is one I'm sorry Brad didn't get to see reach mainstream success. But that's not what Sublime was about, mainstream success. Playing in bars and backyard BBQ's were what they were about, and that's what made them so great. Get this CD, but unless you're a collector of Sublime albums, please don't buy the acoustic album. It's only put out to cash in on the Sublime name if you ask me."
3,Good. Bradley Nowell and co. give it their all.,"When my friend first told me about Sublime, I thought they were some anti-christ, satanic ritual band because the main type of music he listens to, but then I found out who they were. I became interested in hearing some of their stuff. Then I went to a used c.d. store and found ""Sublime"" for 5 bucks! I was like ""yeah!!"" I listened to it and found it entertaining and different. I did find a few problems with though. Some of the songs such as ""The Ballad Of Johnny Butt"", ""Pawn Shop"", and ""Jailhouse"" were too long and draggy and some of the songs sound alot alike because of the style of music it is. But if you're a 311 fan, you should definately give some consideration to buying this album.-Matt Laird"
4,Sublime is awsome!!!,THis a very good cd but not their best. Most people say this is their best because of What I Got.. but there are so many more types of music on this cd than What I got.. IF you just bought it for that than you suck. 40 oz. to freedom is the best of Sublime!
3,Not Bad...Not Great,"The CD really goes down hill after the first 6 songs. The first six are awesome, but after that you just kind of hope the CD is almost done...but it isn't. 17 songs is WAY to many."
2,Sinking lower.,"It seems that every time Sublime releases something new it is worse than the previous album. This album with its ska-punk feel starts of with a bang with ""garden grove"" and ""what i got."" But the fire is put out in the middle of the album with ""pawn shop"" and ""jailhouse"" being too long and draggy."
5,Sublime's the best band of all time!,This CD (and all sublime) is the best. They're one of the most talented and creative bands in the music industry today. It's just so unfortunate that brad had to die before he could even use his talent to it's full potential. Brad RIP and thanks for the music.
5,This is one of Sublime's best CD's,I love this CD. If you like ska you will love this CD. But the only thing you have to do is listen to this CD with a lot of bass. Otherwise it doesn't sound how it is supposed.
1,Two Defective Records Later....,"The delivery service was excellent to get this product for christmas. Getting a WORKING product by christmas is another story. I received the record to find that the entire first record was defective and skipping every 4 seconds or so. This was on both sides. I put in for a return and received another record 3 days later. Once again, the front side was damaged/defective and skipping. I have now put in for my second return. I doubt they'll get it right. This experience has deterred me from looking at amazon as a location for purchasing vinyl of any kind if this is the quality of the products."
5,Go out and get it.,"Now, I dont know how popular Sublime is outside of Southern California. But down here they are [very popular]. Maybe they dont get too musc airplay where you live, who knows. All i know is that they are the most underrated band ever. THis album proves it. From the hit singles to songs you can just kick back and have a drink or smoke too. Definetely go get this album, this album got me into sublime, maybe you can get into it."
5,What a great Album!!!!,"Sublimes the greatest. Its all I listen to driving along in my little car. Santeria rocks, as does Same in the End and Wrong Way. The songs are easy to remember and once you get a particular one stuck in your head it stays there for days and you find yourself singing it all the time. Thoroughly recomended to anyone who is into the reggae kinda surf scene, or anyone who is just looking for a great album to listen to."
5,17 AWESOME tracks,"GARDEN GROVE is a great song and it only gets better with Wrong Way and What I Got. My favorite now is paddle Out because it has a fast surf-like melody. Doin' Time, Same in the End, Caress Me Down and Burritos are the other great songs. THe last 9 are worth a listen."
5,Rest In Peace,Rest in peace to the best musician of all time. This album is wonderful and it is a shame that the most talented musician is lost forever. RIP
3,Good album,"3.5 stars. Sure, it has highs (no pun intended) and lows but there is some good material on this album. The ska/funk thing they have going in is very catchy. The better song you've probably already heard on the radio so what you're getting should really not be a surprise.Recommended."
5,cool baby,this cd is hot. The songs are the best. One song has dirty lyrics so you don't want anyone young listening to it but other then that it rules.
5,Sublime is awesome,"Anyone who doesn't have this cd! Get it, it is worth it. It is one of the bests. I have had it for about 3 years and it is still one of the cd's that stays on my cd deck. I couldn't live with out Sublime and I don't see how anyone can! They are one awesome group."
4,bradley will be missed!,what can i say terrific talent! the only problem is bradley died of an overdose of heroin ! but still even after his death this album still remains one of my favorites! an artistic statement in the making!
5,Listening to sublime puts you in a good mood,Sublime is a group that people of all kinds of music backgrounds can enjoy!They have such a variaty of styles in only one cd!I have not found one person who can say they don't like at least one of their songs!Sublime's music is the kind of upbeat stuff that just puts you in a good mood!Brad may be dead but his music will live forever!
4,good...but not the best,Sublime is one of the all time greatest band....they mix so many types of music to make an amazingly original sound. The self titled cd is good...but 40 oz. to freedom is much better. Props up to Brad...one of the greatest musicians the ever was.
5,Great CD for fans of any type of music.,"This CD has some great songs on it. Especially if you don't just listen to tht mainstreem ones. If you really want to hear the best of sublime, find thier live imports and bootlegs. Nothing beats live sublime. Long Live Bradley!"
3,worth it,"I first bought the Sublime ""Sublime"" album on cassette when it first came out. Time to upgrade to CD..Great Ska/rock mix. I got introduced to some other songs of their's buying this CD"
5,ohhhhhhh yeeaaaaaaa,"How can you not love this album? Perfect for a hot sunny day at the beach, cruisin in your car, or driving up to the mountain to go snowboarding. No other band can duplicate what these guys did. This self titled album is the best release from these california punk/rap/ska legends. Brads voice is smooth and easy to sing along with that wont have u getting sick of this album anytime soon. If you like ska... buy this, if you like punk.... buy this, if you like rock... buy this, i can go on but i think you get the point. WORTH EVERY PENNY~~~~~~"
5,Sublime's best CD,"I really loved this CD because it has some of Sublimes greatest songs like What I Got, Wrong Way , Same in the End, Santeria, and Caress Me Down. This is definitely my favorite CD."
4,I love Sublime!,"On this album sublime really stuck to what I love about them, good fast reggae and great lyrics. Sublime also adds a good mix of punk rock which makes this album I think the best ska album out there since 40 oz. to Freedom in '92."
4,Some great songs,"I really bought this whole CD for the song Caress Me Down. I love that song...but there are some other cool songs on the CD as well, the Wrong Way and Santeria. A lot of the songs sound like they were being played by a local band that was still in the small time. They put all of the words of the songs in the jacket which was cool."
4,The Best CD in Years!,"This has some really great songs. What i got, and Wrong Way are my two favorite songs. A must buy for Alteritive or rock music fans."
4,"Very good album, but loses it in the end.","A very interesting album with a lot of energy. Very good lyrics and music from the band from Long Beach. Gets old in the end, though, due to a slight lack of variation in the songs."
5,Reggae Rock!,By far on of the most original and best rock albums of its time. It is a shame that brad's life had to come to an end.
5,Great disc,"I found this CD at Goodwill tucked away in the corner amongst several greatest hits CD's by the likes of Tom Petty and others. I can't believe someone gave this away, maybe it was for the explicit lyric sticker on the case. I've always liked Sublime, at least what I heard on the radio so I was intrigued. I popped it in the player on the way home and was blown away. Every song that I'd ever heard from Sublime up to that point was on that disc. I was sure it had to be a greatest hits CD but I was wrong. Every song is great and the use of unique sounds like trombones and other brass is way cool. for a $1.95 it was the best deal I've scored in a while. It's on permanent rotation in my player at home."
2,Disappointed!,"I got this to give as a Christmas gift, but when I opened the package the case was cracked in two places! I hope the cd itself isn't cracked. They sent the package in a bubble wrap lined package, instead of a box!"
5,A Music Lovers Must-Have!!,"One of the best CDs to come out of the 90's. Sublime have a unique sound that combines alternative rock, punk, ska, and plain old rock and roll. This is an extremely diverse CD; from Wrong Way and What I got, radio ready hits, to Seed and Paddle Out which are great songs with a punk base. You CAN NOT go wrong with this CD. If you liked this CD and want to hear more music by Sublime, I recommend 40 oz. To Freedom. Also a classic CD by a one of the Greatest bands of the early 90's."
5,I love this cd.,"I love this cd. I think this is one of my favorites i own (if not my favorite). Every song on this thing rocks.When i listen to this cd, it cheers me up."
4,Surprising,"I'll admit right now that I'm a huge .hack fan, but beyond that, the original .hack// game trilogy (infection, etc.) was horrible. Absolutely terrible. Randomly decided one day to give this new trilogy a go, and ordered this. It's a surprisingly good game, after such disappointments with the others. I enjoyed it very much, and had a hard time pulling myself away from it to take myself to work. Beyond work and other necessities I didn't stop playing until it was done. Now moving on to the next in the series.Recommended buy for .hack fans, and maybe if you're just a bored gamer looking for something to play."
1,Not worth the effort,"We just recently set this up for my grandchildren -- ages 2 - 6, girls and a boy and I was extremely disappointed. The ball is too big to easily be kicked through the wickets and the wickets burst apart when hit by the ball. Frustrating at least to me and, I suspect, to the children. I intend to return the set from whence it came and get my money back."
1,Not the Value it Seems,"We purchased this item with the intent to give it as a Christmas gift. The item shipped very quickly, but we were extremely disappointed. The set is NOT packaged for retail purposes. It is packaged as more of a bulk item. There is not a picture nor any description of the contents...therefore the child we were intending to give this to would have no idea what it was nor what to do with it. I honestly would have been embarassed to give it as a gift as it looked second hand or cheap. Also the box the item was in was extremely dusty/dirty (not the shipping box but the actual product). I would not recommend to buy this if you are planning to give it as a gift."
3,No Retail Packaging,Intended to give it as a gift to a 4 year old...strange as there was no retail packaging with photo so he could see and understand what it was for!!
2,"Sadly, the other reviewers are right.","We ordered this for our 3 & 5 year olds. I read the other reviews but felt optimistic. It came today and every negative word is true. It was packaged horribly, the ball is too big for the wickets, the wickets randomly pop open, and the balls don't fully inflate into their fabric skin making them wrinkly and unable to roll straight.Its redemptive value lies in the fact that you can use 4 poles per wicket to make the set work, but that only gives you 6 wickets instead of the usual nine. Despite its fallbacks and the cheap nature of the product (it definitely will not last the whole summer!) we had a good time with the set today.Caveat emptor!"
3,wickets don't stay together,"Love the concept. Like others said, definitely use a regular-size soccer ball, not the big ones that come with the set (by the way , the big balls I received were solid red and blue, a nice sheen to the material but no stripes. The only disappointment for me was that the wickets pop apart of knock over so easily. I recently saw giant wickets made out of pool noodles on the Family Fun website. I think I will try to make those instead for playing kick croquet."
3,fun to watch,"Although it may seem standard and cheesy, it's lots of fun to watch, and it's fairly gory, too. Nine teenagers who live in a small North Carolina town go to the local carnival and have lots of fun. What they don't know is: a killer is stalking them. They proceed to go to a cemetery, tell ghost stories, and camp out in a creepy old abandoned house. Could the killer be lurking inside?Though predictable, ""Death Screams"" is rather fun, exciting, and scary. The music, I thought, was pretty good, and the actors weren't bad either. Many scenes are atmospheric and misty, and believe me, there are ""Death Screams"" aplenty in this one."
1,Terrible!,This movie was terrible. The plot didn't make any sense at all. Even diehard slasher fans should not watch this movie. It's a complete waste of 90 minutes.
3,I want the Pure Fragrance spray for this price,After doing a little research I found out that the Eau de Parfume has a lesser concentration of the fragrance oils than the pure fragrance spray for the same price BUT that being said It's a wonderful classic fragrance. I've worn it for years and have always received compliments on it. So if your new to it go ahead and give it a try.
1,Awful!,"This can't possibly be fresh Estee. There is no sweetness, no floral notes. It smells like an auto repair shop. Horrible. Not at all like any Estee I've had in the past."
4,"Interesting, but...","I bought this set for the 8th, as it has been ""completed"" supposedly by someone who researched it and decided that he had enough info to finish it...must say I found the last two movements to be interesting, but definitely too ""lightweight."" I think Schubert would have agreed with some of it, but definitely done much better. The 5th is Schubert's ""hommage"" to Beethoven's Pastoral...nice but not nearly as good...alot of Mozart and Haydn. There are better 9ths...(Krips). The period instruments and orchestrations were a nice alternative....I say buy it used and enjoy the different approach."
2,Ignores Indonesia's past,"This book spends less than 60 pages describes the rich and diverse pre-Islamic past of Indonesia. The rest of the book treats Indonesia as if it has always been an Islamic state. But even into the late 19th century it was not a majority Muslim, until a series of ethnic-cleansing campaigns aimed at Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Chinese suceeded in making it so.This book is basically a history of Islamic Indonesia and does'nt offer much to those interested in the great diversity of the country or of its rich and ancient history.Seth J. Frantzman"
2,Meh,"I found this book to be a slog of a read. I understand the daunting task of assembling a history of such a diverse people but I found this book to be vague, opinionated, non-linear, overwhelmingly negative in outlook, and the author's knowledge of the surrounding regions and Islam seems to be quite limited."
4,case,"Good sturdy case, but as it is a universal case the sewing machine does slip around a little bit."
2,Flimsy,"I got this ""universal case"" but it's little more than a box with a snap on lid. There are no provisions for securing the machine or its parts, just set the machine on the tray and clip the lid on. I'm a little disappointed."
5,My 49 year old machine finally died!!,"When my old machine died on me I was fit to be tied. With little money and hating to have to read and learn a whole new machine...I settled on the Brother. It arrived in no time and was soooo easy to use. The instructions were simple and really not much change from my 49 year old machine. I used it for two days and put it in the case I also bought and put it away until next time. VERY HAPPY - THANK YOU ""BROTHER""!"
2,worst carrying case!,"Unfortunately I was not lucky with this product, it misses two pieces will eventually cause me a problem, one at the hang piece and another one at the clips."
4,Case for sewing machine,This was a gift to go with the sewing machine I purchased for my daughter for Christmas. It met expectations.
4,brother carrying case,I bought this case to store my brother sewing machine. It is compact and able to store easily.Very sturdy.
4,The sewing machine case,The Carrying Case came as promised and everything fit. It is much more practical than the box that the sewing machine was being stored in. It offers better protection to the parts on the machine and makes it easier to transport.
2,it is just So-So for your Sew-Sewing needs.,The Case is a big cheap plastic case that will fit almost any size sewing machine because it is NOT unique to any brand. I do not know why they even call it a Brother case.I bought it for my Brother 2600i since it does not come with one. The 2600i rattles around in there...I have to put old fabric in there to position and cushion it. The sewing machine still floats to one side making it awkward to carry since it is side heavy.Overall- it is a Hard Case to store your sewing machine. The inside plastic Cards that are suppose to cover the latch rivets fall out and are useless.I have not seen anything better on Amazon so I am keeping it... but it is nothing t get excited about.If Brother actually came out with a custom case that held my sewing machine - like the SC6000 does (which comes with it fro free) I would leave this case in a minute. I should have just bought that sewing machine for that reason alone!
4,I like the large size of this case,"I just purchased the Brother SQ 9000, which came with a hard cover, but not a carrying case. I was hoping this case would be large enough to fit both the sewing machine and it's cover inside, and it is. This way I don't have to find a different storage place for the hard cover. There's also enough room to tuck in my large quilting tray, which I keep in the box it came in and just slide it inside the case next to the machine. I also put the accessories that came with the machine into a small plastic bin and can keep that inside this sewing machine case right with the machine. I gave it four stars because it's made of a very flimsy plastic, which I'm not sure is going to hold up well over time. I've had my old machine for 30 years and the hard case has taken a beating and there's not a ding in it. This case might not last that long."
5,Protection at its best,"I have recently bought a sewing machine and I wanted to be able to take it with me when I go to my camper on the weekends, I was worried about transporting it all the time without protection so I ordered this case, it is hard plastic with a handle on top for easy carrying. The clips on the bottom are pretty reliable I have no doubt about the safety of my machine. The other benefit is there is extra room in the case around my machine for a small sewing kit, so I have everything I need in this one case. I would recommend this case to anyone who likes to take their machines with them or even if you have to store your machine in a closet or something like that, this case is sturdy enough to handle having things sat on top of it. After viewing many cases for sewing machines I feel this one offered the best protection and it was also the cheapest, I paid under $30 with S&H included."
4,It does it's job....,"While this case may be too large for standard sewing machines, I purchased mine specifically for the Brother 1034 Serger. With that in mind, I have to say it fits around the serger perfectly, with enough room to store peddle, some accessories and manual. For $20, I think it is a good buy and does what it has to....protect my machine and make it easier to transport."
3,"Okay, but not great",I was disappointed in that this case is just a plastic box with no way of locking a sewing machine into place so it doesn't shift around. The seller got it here quick as a wink so I have no complaints with the seller.
2,Too bulky,"While the dimensions of this product were certainly given in the description and I take some responsibility for not getting my tape measure out, the picture gave me the impression that the case was more compact than it turned out to be. The fact that it is a ""universal"" carrying case means that it is much larger than needed to accomodate the sewing machine I bought. This is because it is intended to also accomodate a serger, which is a larger machine. Space considerations were a factor in my decision to purchase a new machine and the unwieldy size of the new case made it unacceptable to me. If space is not a problem, this case would be OK."
1,Way Too Big!,"The picture of the item is deceiving as its taken from the side, so you can't see how enormous it really is. It takes up too much storage space too. I recommend seeing if the Singer case might fit better."
1,Brother 5300 Universal Sewing Machine Carrying Case,"Do not bother to buy this sewing machine case. It is crappy! Don't be fooled by the ""Universal"" phrase of this product. I have a Brother sewing machine so i bought this item. When i got it, i placed my sewing machine and it rattles around inside the case. I don't see what is so ""Universal"" about this. There is too much room inside and my machine tips over to its sides when i lift to carry the case. It's terrible!!! I'd give NO star but i don't have that choice on the selection. I wanted to return it but it's not worth the shipping charge that will show up on my refund due to Amazon's policies. By then i would probably only get at most $12.00 back in refunds."
4,Fits Brother PE500 Embroidery Machine,"I was looking for a case big enough to fit my Brother PE 500 embroidery machine WITHOUT the embroidery arm attached and this case fit the bill. The length is the perfect size, it is a little big width wise but it allows me to fit the hoops, chords, and arm inside the case. If you're looking for a case to take this machine places with you I wouldn't recommend this case bc of how big it is width wise. I bought a rolling cart with a 50% off coupon at Michael's that works great for this purpose."
5,Light and strong,Light and strong can fit on my sewing machine and still have more space to put more stuff
1,Recieved damaged,"I like the way the cover looks but it was damaged when I got it. I don't know how that could have happened because it was in an outer box and the inner box it was in was not damaged at all. I am bummed, now I have to hassle with retuning it. I will get another one though :)"
3,wrapping,I had package wrapped and it was torn the bag was to small for the box and now i have to wrap it that was $10 down the drain
1,It's broken! =(,My case came broken by UPS! And I had no sulutions by now! I'm so angry because I paid a expensive price by the case and the ship! I NEED answers! =(
2,Don't like it.,Do not like the shape of this case. Too large for my sewing machine. I llke the simple one with rounded four corners without so many ridges.
3,Keeps the dust off,Does the job of covering the machine. Nothing fancy. Don't plan on using this to haul the machine around from place to place. I think it feels too flimsy for that
3,Machine cover,"This is a good sewing machine carrying case but not a super one. It is not easy to get the top to fit down on the bottom to close. However for the price, who can complain? I needed something to put my machine in that could reach into the closet and grab."
2,rather cheaply made,The sewing machine cover was rather cheaply made; the sides are not sturdy and the cover feels inadequate for the job. I'm using it on a cheap machine so I won't be disappointed if the clasp or body fails.
1,carrying case,"This carrying case is an unnecessary option. The sewing machine already comes with its own case. The case is flimsy, and mine arrived cracked and damaged. Did not try to return as the shipping would have been prohibitive, so I had to eat the loss."
2,Sewing Machine cover,Brother 5300 Universal Sewing Machine Carrying CaseThis case is fine but the sewing machine (Brother XL 2610) does not fit securely into it. It requires that I save the styrofoam that the machine was packaged in when it came. I wanted a cover that fit over the machine easily for storage for short term. This case isn't it.
2,not required,"as with so many such products, the benefits are illusory; it did not appear at all effective for its purpose as the sewing machine came with an effective case"
2,Case very warped!,"The case is hard to fit together because the sides of the cover are very warped. They curve inward and this causes the cover not to fit nicely onto the base. I have to pull quite hard on both sides in order for it to fit onto the base. Big pain and not easy to do with only one person. I did not send it back as I thought the rest of the Brother cases would be warped too. I would definitely not recommend buying this case. I would try a different one, like maybe the one SInger makes."
2,Marginal product,"I ordered the case to protect my wife's new machine but was disappointed in the quality and design. Inside the top of the box where the handle mounts, the metal strap was rusted. My concern was a few years from now carrying the machine by the handle of this case and having the handle fall off destroying the sewing machine when it hits the floor. If this manufacturer uses cheap metal that rusts, they may also use cheap plastic which becomes brittle. This caused me to evaluate the fasteners on the side. I would have preferred to see rivets here securely connecting the side latches fully through the case. We don't want a latch to fail causing the machine to fall out the bottom of the case. This storage box may be cost affective for the manufacture to assemble but do you want to spend your hard earned money on a nice sewing machine only to see it destroyed after falling out of this storage box? I may be critical on the quality of this box but I'm also an automotive engineer."
3,Damaged x2,"I bought this along with a Brother CS1600 sewing machine for my mother for Christmas.When she opened the box the carrying case came in she discovered the plastic on the bottom portion of the case was cracked, leaving the case useless. The box showed no signs of damage so I do not believe it was damaged during delivery. We promtly contacted Amazon to return the damaged item and have a new one sent out. Due to issues with obtaining and printing the shipping label, Amazon allowed us to dispose of the damaged case and they sent out a new one.We received the new on and the top portion of the case had a small crack and the metal screws holding the handle in were very rusty.Luckily we hadn't thrown away the first damaged case. We put the undamaged bottom and undamaged cover together so she had a decent case. She is now very happy with her carrying case. The sewing machine doesn't fit snugly inside of the case but that doesn't seem to be an issue for her."
1,Incomplete product.,"Gave as a gift, when the recipient opened it, the lower half of the case was missing, and unfortunately it's outside the Amazon return window. There are clearly many quality control issues with this product. Avoid."
3,Not what I expected,"I guess I should have known that being a ""universal"" carrying case, the machine wouldn't fit perfectly, but as it's a Brother product and I have a Brother sewing machine, I did expect it to fit a little better than it did! I have the Brother ""Sew Advanced"" XL2600i machine and while it does fit in the case, there is a lot of space around the machine, causing it to slide within the case when I move it. It works for me as I don't move the machine very far when I want to use it and I will be careful, but if you expect your machine to fit snugly into the case, it probably won't. I am still happy with the purchase as it does make it easier for me to remove the machine to use and to store it nicely in my closet and the extra space around the machine does allow me to store other sewing materials with the machine. All in all, the case is well built and sturdy and certainly worth the cost if you're willing to move it carefully so as not to damage the machine."
3,"Case ok, Shipping NOT","I bought this as a gift and had it shipped to my friend. I was very disappointed to find out that the case was cracked in shipping. I emailed about it, but didn't hear anything back. Rather than fill out the required paperwork to return the case for a replacement, my friend had someone glue the case. I'm just thinking that the glue probably isn't good to rely on for actually carrying the machine."
1,"too big, too cheap, and top doesn't fit","really cheap, and much too big for the machine (brother 2600) we have. however, the biggest problem was that the top sides were pushed in and didn't fit the base."
2,Brother 5300 Universal Sewing Machine Carrying Case,"The case is far too big for machine, which slides around when carried. It is less than useful for that reason"
3,carry case,haven't really had a need to use it yet - but feel it is notquite as sturdy as ad depicted
5,"Works great, no more dust!",Now I can store my Brother 5300 without having to wrap a sheet over it. Easy to use and makes the machine easy to carry from my craft station to wherever I stash it in between sewing jobs.
3,Brother 53oo Universal Sewing Machine,It fits but it is not a custom made fit. Not entirely what I expected. If it had a finer fit it would keep it from getting banged around.
3,sewing machine carrying case,"The case is large and holds the sewing machine I bought, but it doesn't sit level on a table. It can spin around on the bottom of the case. This is a minor annoyance since I remove the machine from the case when I sew."
3,Machine Cover,I liked the cover but was disappointed when I put the sewing machine in it. Its universal but it moves around too much in the cover. I guess its just good to cover it with as long as your not taking it anywhere. I would get one that is for this specific machine next time.
2,Don't believe it!,"This case, purchased at Amazon.com, is not ""Universal""!The case is shaped (notice the narrower ends)so that the machine that we ordered, The Brother PC 210PRW, with a cover that must be in place to be complete, will not fit inside the case.Suggest you think twice about ordering this accessory which appears to be unnecessary. If you find that you absolutely need a case, shop around for something with square ends."
5,Perfect Fit,It was a perfect fit for my Brother sewing machine. It was price just right as well. It's well made and sturdy.
3,Universal sewing Machine case,It is hard to tell by the picture what it really looks like. When we put the sewing machince it there was lots of room which made the machine not very stable. We bought it because we also bought a Brothers Sewing Machine.
3,Way too big,"I actually thought this case was way too big for the sewing machine, it was made more for a giant machine wich they really just dont make anymore."
2,Inappropriate,Did not fit sewing machine as I expected. I thought when I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife that it was a match for the sewing machine I bought for her.
4,gift,The sewing machine came with a case so this wasn't needed at all. I don't know why they offer it in a package deal. I would have sent it back but it was more trouble than it was worth.
1,Cheap and Flimsy,"I am very disappointed in this case. I thought it would be like my last case, and attach to the bottom of my sewing machine, but it doesn't. Unless you carry it perfectly straight, your machine rattles around inside - not something I want. The only reason I'm not returning it is because I have another, heavy duty machine that I seldom use, and this will be fine for storing.I do NOT recomment this case."
1,don't waste your money,the Brother machine I bought came with a cover---it was not evident on the details...so I wasted $20. don't bother.
1,Way Too Big for Standard Portable Sewing Machine,"I feel really dumb for getting this case now that I'm reading others' reviews.I have a compact Brother Sewing Machine (2600i). I decided I should protect it when not in use so I went to the Amazon product page for my machine and trusted that Amazon was recommending a ""matching"" carrying case. The case they recommend and I bought is so big that there are 1.5 inches of space on both sides and 2.5 inches in front and in back of my machine. Therefore the case protects my machine from dust when it's in one place, but if I lift and carry it the machine can rock inside the case. So it's not ideal as a carrying case. Plus it takes up so much room. Very disappointing.Unfortunately returning it costs nearly $10- hardly worth it for a $20 item."
3,"Not what I expected, but still does what it's suppose to","My machine is alot smaller then this case, so it does move around when I carry it... if I had seen it before purchasing I probably would not have got it, but it does pertect it if I'm not moving around too much... I guess that's what you get with a ""Universal"" case."
1,Brother 5300 sewing machine carrying case,I returned this item because it was too big for the Brother ES2000 sewing machine I bought. It was very bulky and took up way too much room. The machine rattled inside the case and slipped around. It would probably be better for a larger machine.
5,Perfect!,"I purchased this case to store my Brother serger. As other reviews pointed out, it is a little big but I used the space up perfectly for the pedal, accessories, unfinished projects, etc. I will be purchasing another one for my sewing machine. It seems very durable. Currently, I have it at the bottom of a craft closet with several boxes on top and it is holding up fine."
5,Good value for the price.,"This is a good sewing machine case for the price. The top attaches to the bottom securely and it is big enough to put all your sewing items which is a big plus for me because I tend to lose things. Now I can clear off my kitchen table, put all my sewing supplies plus sewing machine in this cause - and make dinner!"
4,Second time's the charm,"I was surprised when I opened this item and found that the bottom half of the case was missing. (And yes, I did wonder--how hard could it be to package an item with only two large parts?) In reading over the product reviews, I noticed that another customer had had the same issue. Amazon handled it very well. They provided a return label and shipped out a new case immediately. Fortunately, the second one was fine."
5,Commenting on my purchase..,I bought this book for my son. It is a beautiful way to tell your son how much you love him and advised and encouraged him on everything he is planning to do. I recommend it to everyone who has a son and would like to let him know how you feel in a poetic and loving way.
5,yasmin,Yasmin is awesome!I can wear her make-up and she can wear mine.Any thing I put on her washes right off!!!I would recommend this for girls ages 6--------14 because it is great for practicing putting on make-up.
1,not worth the money,well i have a six year old daught who wants bratz everything but she got this head the make up would not stay on and it was boaring she wanted to take it back after about 5 min. the hair was falling out. she was just plain board. so she then gave it to her 4 year old sister who thought it was boaring to. we ended up returing the doll.
5,UNBALIEVABLE,LADY WRITING ON DECEMBER 4 YOU ARE A HUGE JERK YOUR DOING MORE HARM BY OVERREACTING THE SUBJECT LIKE THAT HAVE YOU SEEN HOW MANY KIDS GO ON HERE THIS IS A KIDS WEBSITE I THINK IM MORE MATURE THAN YOU AND IM 12 1/2 YOU HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM I HOPE YOU DONT HAVE KIDS MAKEING FUN OF A LITTLE BOY YOU JERK BECAUSE OF SAYING SOMETHING LIKE CAN MAKE HIM COMMIT SUICIDE.SO BE A JERK SOMWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Difficult to clean/Small parts,"My 5 year old daughter got this for Christmas and has played with it maybe three times. She is sort of a tom-boy though. It is a really pretty doll and great for a girl that wants to play with glitter, make up or hairstyles. Here are the downfalls based on my personal experience with this toy; the glitter, and make up is very difficult to clean off of the plastic face of the doll and it is very messy and can be spilled easily (reminds me of play doh). The base could be a bit larger or wider, the dolls head is quite large and can easily tip or fall. Also the hair is very straight and has limitations to how a girl can style the doll's hair. If you have another younger child or a baby or even a toddler at home, this toy is is not recommended unless you take away the glitter, make up, and small parts that come with it. Your little girl may think this toy is useless without those items, but she can still brush and play with the hair."
1,Not worth the money,"I got this for my daughter last Christmas and she became so frustrated with it. My daughter is 6 years old and loves make-up. The make-up that comes with this is awful. It is just gel and glitter, which is hard to clean up and doesn't look that great either. It would be better if it included lipstick, blush and powder eye-shadow. She never did enjoy playing with it and it eventually got tossed. I was very disappointed, because the styling head itself is beautiful. With the right make-up it would be awesome."
3,packaging,"Each coil arrived squashed, that is the mounting hole was closed, and will be irritating to open each time. I am a weekend warrior so I will survive, but for the pro what a hassle. I do not know if it was packaging or shipping but I will try a different source next time. Maybe a plastic plug in the hole would help."
1,Card Scan doesn't work out,I recently upgraded to the latest Card Scan Executive 700. I have installed and reinstalled several times but cannot get it to function. After checking the internet I have discovered I am not the only one with this complaint. I have Windows XP professional and there seems to be an issue. I am awaiting a response from the Card Scan tech site. I simply can't recommend this product. My first card scan was a piece of cake and worked unfailingly for several years. I'm disappointed that it is more difficult now than my original card scanner!
4,CardScan,"This is an excellent product that, given the difficult task it is asked to do, does a wonderful job. The only limitation os the synchronization software with Outlook. The software has the typical problems of software written by techies and not by ordinary users but overall, the hardware is excellent."
2,Cardscan Executive 700,Software for product is disappointing. It does not allow for enough data fields to imput for sorting. I would have bought the better scanner if I had known about the limitations
1,Will not work with 64 bit OS,"Note this will not work with a modern operating system (64 bit) and the company has decided not to every write a driver for x64 machines.So unless you use XP, don't buy this one."
1,First Impression Buyer Beware,"Tried to install. No driver included apparently. Couldn't find a driver down load on the site. Tech support is ""closed"" at 3 pm PDT. Can't return it either because I opened it."
5,Excellent Book,"I am not an authority on the life of Emiliano Zapata and realize his life was and is entangled in much myth. Nevertheless, I feel his life is worth reading about and there is no better strat than with Womack's account (or perhaps Samuel Brunk's). Great book written about a Mexican legend."
3,An Excellent Look at the Hard Life of Moroccan Berbers,"...this is a very good description of the hard life that many Moroccan Berbers STILL endure today. The author does a suberb job of accurately portraying the widening gap between the rich and poor in Morocco, and the frustrations that the impoverished must face each and every day of their existence. I live in Morocco and will make this book required reading for my children. Well done Mr. Oussaid."
3,Nice dress watch,I bought a black face with brown leather from elsewhere for 50% off. It's a great watch to wear with shirt and tie. Been happy with Wenger watch for 10 years until it died from getting wet. I thought of doing other brand before finding this type on sale. Good bargain for my xmas present.
2,Diappointing Lift-the-flap book,"The writing in this book is very basic but not in a way that educations. When describing the Alligators the book says they are big and like to eat instead of telling us something unique to alligators. Also, the flaps are not interesting. The page will say the Wiggles see an animal, such as a snake, and they gives two flaps to look under that has the same animal. For such a large book I would have thought they could have added a few more flaps and put more variety under the flaps. I was very disappointed in this book."
1,Not the full episodes.,"I thought this was a great deal for only $5, and so I could overlook the shoddy menu and format that the reviewer above mentions. But what I cannot get over is the shortening of some of the episodes. Looking for some childhood nostalgia, I decided to buy this DVD. Upon seeing one of my favorite Popeye episodes in the list of cartoons I chose to play it. The episode itself is 17 minutes long. The version on this DVD, however, was only about 8 minutes long. They cut more than half of the episode from this DVD. You can go on youtube and watch the entire episode. Although this DVD is very cheap, the quality and effort put into the making of it is definitely subpar."
5,Great Buy!,This is a very informative book about a self-made family that became very wealthy and well known. This was a great buy. $20.00 cheaper than I could get it at the Builtmore Estate.Thank you Amazon!
5,The Vanderbilts,"The book is well written and like looking at the colored pictures.I am fascinated by stories of famous, rich people.I try to imagine what it would be like if I am in that situation.It is hard for me to put the book down.I like Anderson Cooper and curious about him but he is so private."
2,Stay away from it - 6100 series should be recalled,"This would be an excellent desktop replacement notebook. The Satellite Pro 6100 series has serious design flaws and the mainboard and power system has to be replaced every now and then, most after 6 months of use. ......"
3,So so glasses,"With these optics the only way to get a 4x30 is to have a small field of view. It's about 5 degrees, roughly 300ft/1000yd. The clarity is sharp at center with significant chromatic aberration at the sides. If you aren't worried about how wide your view is then these binoculars should suffice."
1,they are junk,"they are junk, made of plastic and will not focus i would not buy these even for a 5 year old"
3,May not be the real thing,"Ozonated Olive Oil is produced by bubbling ozone through it continuously for an extended period of time. During this time, the olive oil changes into an off-white paste. This procedure usually takes 3 to 6 months of 24-hour a day bubbling. When I received this oil it was just oil which created doubt in my mind. I chose this because it was $12.00, much less than the $30.00 average online. Lesson learned."
3,H202w/olive oil ( ozonated olive oil},I would give it a higher rating...if I knew it was ok to arrive in a liquid state...i thought it was to remain in a solid state? and you kept it in the refrigerator????/ anyway it sure smells good and feels good on my skin...i just hope it still is the same product????Thank You Shelly ps please let me know about the product if it was harmed in shipment??????
2,this ozonated olive oil is not so good,Ozonated olive oil is suppose to be condence like butter when put in a cool place like the refrigerator. The ozononated olive oil that I received did not condence when I put it in the refrigerator which means that it was not ozonated properly. I contacted the manufacturer and he told me to put it in the freezer this was not the right answer. I will not buy this product again. You can not trust the company and the way it was made.
4,For Short Term Use,"It's important to note that a scholarly study showed that ozonated oils on the skin ""like other drugs, poisons and radiation, can display either a damaging effect from a long exposure or a beneficial effect after a brief exposure to O2 and O3 or to the application of ozonated oil to chronic wounds."" (Source: The dual action of ozone on the skin by Valacchi G, Fortino V, Bocci V, University of Siena, Italy.) That said, the product is soothing although you wouldn't want to use it before going out in public; you'll smell like ozone."
2,"Not sure if it works, and the smell is absolutely nauseating.","Putting something with ozone (an industrial cleaner) directly on your face literally makes me sick. Wish there had been some sort of warning about the overwhelming smell of the stuff in the ad! Plus, you have to keep it in the fridge for some reason--which turns it into a solid white lump of grease. Fuggedaboutit!"
5,Superb documentary...,"I watched this series as well as the original Connections as a young man. How apt and ironically accurate of todays internet, celebrity and decaying banking world. This series brings some truth and explaination to todays world which is stunning when one considers it and Connections were broadcast thirty or so years ago. James Burke is a much neglected visionary and watching this again was a reminder why he has been one of my favourite documentary makers since the seventies.If I am ever asked, ""why is technology the way it is today?,"", or ""how is science and technology likely to affect society?"" Then I will simply say ""Don't ask the experts of today, ask James Burke!"""
4,Timeless Insight,"This brilliant series is as relevant, informative and useful today as it was when it was first broadcast. James Burke offers wonderful insight into issues that were pivotal in changing the way we see our world. Great thought provoking information and presented in a relaxed style that makes it entertaining to watch."
1,Warning!!!!!!!!!! Killed half of my fish in tank,"I used this product in my tank after it was highly recommended by my local fish store. I was told that ""you could accidentally dump the whole package in and it won't harm anything"". Well..after using the dose required for my tank, it killed half of my fish within a few hours. I was told that the dust like particles got into the fish's gills and left them unable to breathe. This stuff is not safe!!!!"
1,Haven't received a microphone yet!!!,I haven't received a microphone yet!!! Ordered since the beginning of March. Don't know what's wrong with Amazon!!!!
5,american idol karaoke,"Lots of fun. Simon and Randy look so real. Makes me feel like I was really an ""American Idol! The eye Camera is also a fun addition."
2,Thought it would much more fun,"I was completely jazzed about getting this ganme after reading all the reviews but I found it was really difficult to satisfy the game's singing exactments and I can hold a tune and have good timing. It was really difficult for the kids to play and no one wanted to play it after a while. The judges really slam you every time you sing no matter if you do a good job or not and then they say things (even good comments) that don't pertain to the situation. It got played with about 3 times since Christmas. Believe me, I thought I would love this but I think a karaoke machine would serve us better."
3,It's Fun,"I purchase this game for my 7 year old, he does not know most of the song but he still likes the game. My daughter on the other hand, she loves it. She is 14 and her friends come over to play it and they play that game all night long. Most of the time I have to tell them to go to bed. Wow, not particularly for a 7 year old but they can have fun if they read well but my 14 year old it's a party when we hook that game up...."
4,What fun!,"I bought this game for my birthday party, and we had a lot of fun, as adults. I do wish there was a greater selection and variety of songs, but I will say the game is great if you have a bunch of outgoing friends looking to have a good time."
2,What happened here?,"This is probably the worst Karaoke Revolution game ever. I'm a huge fan of all the Karaoke Revolutions... but this one is terrible. The graphics are horrendous. Also, Where's Paula Abdul? The movie clips in the game are beyond lame. The judges critiques are awkward and pretty stupid.But in the end, its just a karaoke game... and if you like the song list... its a decent buy... but of all the KRs this by far is the worst."
4,Singstar microphones not compatible,The game microphone requirements are not clearly specified. Microphones supported include Karaoke Revolution and Logitech USB.We had Singstar microphones which are not compatible.
5,American Idol Songs,"Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol is great fun for the whole family. Compete in the American Idol Competition and listen to the judges praise you or bomb you; either way, it's a lot of fun. The forty songs on this game are:All My LifeAlone(There's) Always Something There To Remind MeBe Without YouBreakawayBuild Me Up ButtercupCan't Help Falling In LoveCrazy Little Thing Called LoveDilemmaDo I Make You Proud?Don't Let The Sun Go Down On MeDon't You Want MeEasyEvery Rose Has It's ThornFlying Without WingsHeartbreakerHeavenHungry Like A WolfIf You Don't Know Me By NowIt's Not UnusualJust The Way You AreLet's Stay TogetherLove Will Keep Us TogetherMore Than WordsPhotographPiano ManProud MaryRock With YouSaving All My Love For YouShe BangsStand By MeStickwituStraight UpSugar, We're Going DownThe Real ThingTotal Eclipse Of The HeartUnwrittenWhat A Girl WantsYou And MeYou've Lost That Loving Feeling"
3,"Be warned if you have a SingStar game, the microphone is not compatible with American Idol game","We were very excited while waiting for this game to arrive. We had played it many, many times at friends houses and loved it! We already have SingStar so we knew that our girls, aged 9 & 10, were ready for more karaoke fun! When the American Idol game arrived, we quickly ripped the packaging off and popped the game into our PS2 with great anticipation, however we were so disappointed to see that the SingStar microphone is not compatible with this game. I couldn't believe it! How stupid is that???? Why on earth would you need separate microphones??? I felt really ripped off knowing that until we get more microphones it will sit in it's box and wait. No one can enjoy it. This is really annoying."
4,"Fun, but had to buy new microphones for the game!",The girls LOVE this game; however our Singstar microphones aren't compatible. I ended up buying the PS2 Boogie game & microphone bundle so we'd have a mic that worked (and it made more sense to pay an extra $10. for the bundle).
5,Sweet Sixteen -,"... I'm not sure, but I believe she has decided to forgive us for not buying her a car ;-)"
1,Also useless,"It was OK while I had Windows Vista, but since it was replaced with the newer system it is now also obsolete."
1,"Good book, but...........","This book, good as it is, is exactly the same as ""Windows Vista, Simplified"" same publisher and all. The table of contents are identical. The page no's are different because ""Visually"" is a smaller book. I had one book and inadvertantly order the other one, not knowing. Either of the two books are to be considered a ""good book"""
5,I highly recommend this book.,"I do computer consulting for a living, and have used this book with many of my customers, whether recommending it, or buying it for them. If you want to know how to setup your email in Windows Vista, or how to change your homepage, look the topic up in the front of the book, and go to that chapter and specific page. There are color pictures describing each step that walk you through the process. I love it and can't recommend it enough for new computer users, or those who just want to know more about their version of windows.Paul Buckner,author of: ""From Broke To Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedom""and""Gabriel Jennings and The Ferret Freedom Fighters."""
5,great buy,"This is a very good book for windows vista.....I have not gotten very far along but looking forward to learning more, easy to understand..."
4,VISTA wins me over!,"I really did not want to have a computer with Vista; I have Windows XP at home and really like that operating system. Unfortunately, at work I got a new computer, and it had Vista. I was determined to get up and running as quickly as possible and this was the book I chose. It was a good choice, there are many full color illustrations and it is broken up into chapters to teach me. It was sort of learning to ride a bike all over again. Once I got started, I was launching and working with the different programs and then creating and editing documents. I got up to speed on playing music and other media and then I was happy. I learned to love the notebook features, and was able to customize my windows vista. I felt bad for complaining, but this book helped me turn my life around."
4,windows vista,"Teach Yourself VISUALLY Windows Vista (Teach Yourself VISUALLY (Tech))Great book for a hands on person. I understand things better when there are visual examples that I can use. The only problem (so far) is the fine print. I sometimes need a magnifier to read it and wish that part of it was more user friendly. If not for that issue, I would give it a 5 star review. So, if you don,t have a problem working with fine print, I would recommend this book."
4,Teach Yourself Visually Windows Vista,This is a very good manual for learning Window Vista. It uses text and graphics to show you how to do a particular function. It has lost some clarity in graphics since the Marans longer do them. It is weak on virus protection and how to prevent them. It covers just about every basic function you will encounter in Vista and I would recommend it for people moving to Vista or those just starting out on a computer.
3,Another one on Atlantis,"I thought it was another decent book on Atlantis but certainly not the final answer. While the author attempted a non-biased position I thought there was tunnel vision towards his own theory and the evidence used. What was Atlantis? A city, a region, a continent or perhaps an era. Just another book on Atlantis and thats all it is."
1,Romertopf 3-Quart Clay Baker,"This product arrived poorly packed and broken. I was very disappointed as I was anticipating using it for a recipe I had selected from a Clay Pot cookbook. Needless to say, I had to return and is very hestitant about ordering again unless they improve their packaging."
1,product packaging!,"this product has the worst packaging I have ever seen! needless to say, it arrived broken. beware of it. the product itself is great...had one for many years when I lived overseas."
5,Really excellent for lazy cooks,"Soak the romertopf in cold water while you're preparing your meat and vegetables. Take the romertopf out, put the food in, put the romertopf in the oven (no preheating), turn it on, and forget about it until dinner is done. My mother got me one of these as a gift and it started as a countertop curiousity that has morphed into a regular cooking item. The romertopf has extremely forgiving cooking times, and so you don't have to worry much about overcooking, and the food ends up incredibly flavorful and tender. Fantastic for pot roasts, pork roasts, lamb roasts, small chickens, etc."
1,Came broken,"The Romertopf 3- quart Clay Baker came broken, it was packed terribly, there is no way it could have arrived unbroken. I ended up reordering it from Breadtopia, all the clay bakers I have ever ordered from them have arrived in perfect shape . I only ordered off of Amazon because I had a deal on shipping. Although I must admit Amazon did come to my house for the return. The Romertopf I received from Breadtopia is just as expected, packed with care. I bake wonderful breads in this, it is a joy to own."
4,Reco Romertopf No 111 4-6 pound clay baker,Very good method of cooking food to make it tasty and to cook it quickly. Usually for this type of cooking I have used a slow cooker. Slow cookers are not as fast as aRomertopf. In a Romertopf the results are excellent and quicker.
2,clay pot,I bought two clay pots from different makers. They both arrived unbroken.I did not like this pot as the lid was ill-fitting.The other brand ( German) looked better and had a glazed lining to the bottom of pot making for easy clean up.Spend a bit more and enjoy the clay pot for more years.
4,NOT BAD AT ALL,"To the person from Milwaukee, WI, speaking of Tim's ""Heartbeat Collection"", been desperately looking for it, anyway I can buy a copy from you?If so, please contact me at kerwincortez@hotmail.comThanks"
4,"Boom! is good, but not as good as his old mixes","Tim has always been my favorite Freestyle mixer. I used to have all the ""Heartbeat"" mixes (if you guys thought FSB was good than you MUST find his old ""for promo use only"" mixes! ). I bought this cd back when it first came out and listened to it for awhile, put it on the shelf for a year then broke it out again last night. It really does have some good songs and is worth the money. THIS IS NOT SOME LAME COMPILATION, THIS IS A GOOD MIX. I guess living in Milwaukee I was spoiled with all his old mixes (Tim is from WI) thats why I was just a little disapointed with FSB. Can't wait for Vol.2."
4,Nice and not so nice,"These are two CDs and two different fortepianos. The fortepiano on the first CD (Impromtus d899, D935) is an original one from 1826, and it has a magically beautiful, really coulourful sound. The fortepiano on the second disk is a modern copy, with an unfortunately unpleasant sound. Lambert Orkis's playing is elegant, stylish and very intelligent, enjoyable, I have no problems with it. Even if I compare his playing to famous pianists like Brendel (I very much like Brendel's early Vox recording of the impromtus) or Schnabel, I'd say Orkis gives a convincing interpretation of Schubert. If the sound of the second disk were more pleasant, this would be a 5 star CD, so I give four."
4,Great pack at a bargain price.,"The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars was that the free compass attached to the carabiner broke at the corner where it was supposed to be attached. But still it was a freebie so who cares, it wasn't the deciding factor on my choosing this bag. Saving dollars was the important thing for me. Lots of room in this pack and built for comfort. There is an insulated pouch for a hydration bag inside this pack. I purchased a 3 liter hydration bag for under $20 so maybe if you can find a bag like this with hydration system at under $60 go for it, otherwise this is the pack for you. If you are looking for a great pack for little money don't look any further."
2,Tradition Card Collector,"I think that if People are going to sell these games for decently high prices, they should at least include the limited edition cards with the game."
4,"If you loved the show, you'll love this!","I got this game because I loved the show and this game is great. The game follows the storyline of the show very well. The game play is awesome and easy to learn. The battle menu, card selection screen, and everything is great.There are times that I wish to skip the battle animation, but I just had to sit through it, there's no other way. Also, the only other thing I didn't like was the random chance of getting special calls from spirits. I tried over a million times and still couldn't get the exact card I needed to finish 100% collection. I only missed one card and in the whole game wouldn't give it to me. The Black Luster Solider Envoy soooo freaking hard to get, it was ridiculous! I just gave up after seeing dark magician girl so few times and she never give it to me.Overall, this is an excellent game. I just wish it wasn't based on chance for getting special cards."
3,Not as good as People think - Not enough Info,"Though NMS publishes OK books for USMLE, this one just barely makes it. It does not have all the information one would need for CSA. Coverage is inconsistent, either some topics are covered elaboratley or just ignored. Though it says CSA book, wonder if author ever took CSA, as there are not many tips or information relevant to the exam. It is more like a physical examintion ( sketchy though ) book. Not tailored for CSA, not at all. It wont be enough to read this book only for CSA."
4,I really enjoy this book,"I recommend this book highly, specially if English is not your native language. This book will teach you how to make a medical note as you need in the CSA exam. Furthermore is a short a concise review."
2,misleading,"I feel I paid too much for this book. It contains a lot of things unrelated to CSA. Even the author wrote ""for csa purpose,the multiaxial system will not helpful."" on page 140. I will ask the author what is the goal you publish this book. If you think something is not helpful for CSA,why did wrote those in your book. I have no time to waste. ..."
4,Perfect Book !!,I used this book to pass the CSA exam. CSA test is easy if you prepare well for it. This book give you many clues for this exam. The writing notes are very helpful. I passed the USMLEs with good scores but I did not had an idea how to make a medical note in English. Maybe some extra information in this book is not needed. I highly recommend it !
1,Don't waste your time,"""...may lack the sparkling wit of its predecessors"" is a vast understatement. I wanted to like this book, hoping that at least if there had to be a prequel written it would actually be good, but it felt like I was reading a bad parody of the original series. Or maybe an alternate universe variation. Zelazny did the bickering family with the initially clueless protagonist already, and he did it 10 times better. If you liked Zelazny's Amber books, you'll be disappointed, or at the very least, bored. If you haven't read Zelazny's Amber books, I suggest you skip this book and read them instead."
1,300 pages but nothing new,"I agree with many other reviewers that the style is uninspired, but Zelazny was a---perhaps *the*---master stylist of science fiction. So I'm willing to cut Betancourt a break there.But the book is boring. Unlike the original Amber novels, there are absolutely no surprises. Anything we learn, see, or discover is already obvious to anyone who has read the original series. No discoveries, no character development, no nothing.And couldn't the publisher afford a proofreader? The edition I read is riddled with typographic errors."
1,"horrid, horrid book","Perhaps the worst book I have ever read. I figured that with Zelazny's notes to follow, at least a credible attempt would come of it, however I would sooner gouge my eyes out with a dull nail file than read any of betancourt's work again after reading this novel, yes sucker that i was read all three of them to see if it got better, thinking it may have been a buildup to getting into the midset to write about zelazny's creation....trust me folks, dont waste your time or money, search the web for fan art of zelazny's works, and contact zelazny's estate holder and scream bloody murder about greed and terrible books advertising his name."
3,Elevated fanfic?,"I love RZ... let's face it, we lost a treasure when he died. I adore his Amber works. It has to be one of the most original, fun, diverse and interesting universes/concepts I've come across so far.The title of this book is misleading, I would have been happier with 'The Dawn of Amber' then in smaller print 'A novel set in the Amber universe' rather then splashing RZ's name about like he personally approved it.It ADDS many new concepts that RZ never touched on, and changed a few of the known standards of that universe.If you consider this as a commercial piece of fanfic - it's rather fun and interesting to see where Betancourt has taken it, though I can not put it next to my RZ books with confidence.Looking at it from someone who plays Amber Diceless - a role playing game co-created with RZ, it does alow for a lot more family variations that would be very interesting for gamers."
4,Good Read for a Rainy Day,"The storyline is fitting, although the composition lacks Zelazny's depth of development. Still, it is a very good read for a rainy day."
5,Well Written and Fun,"As a longtime Amber and Zelazny fan, I'd say that Betancourt has done a good job of capturing the style and spirit of Zelazny's Amber series. Don't get me wrong, Zelazny could have done a better job. But since Zelazny's gone, and the job had to be given to a mere mortal, I'm quite pleased with the way it turned out. One point: I notice that the charcater of Oberon, the narrator of this book, seems to lack some of the toughness and self-confidence of the Oberon from the actual Amber series, but this is not unexpected, since this is a much younger Oberon than we encountered in Zelazny's work. All in all, an enjoyable read and faithful to the original. I'm looking forward to the rest of Betancourt's series."
5,Very fun to read,"As everyone has pointed out this is not Zelazney, but it is still very readable. I for one enjoyed the parallels in Oberon's story to that of Corwin in Nine Princes in Amber. This book was fun to read and hard to put down. It had good pacing and a nice flow. It is very enjoyable if you read it on it's own merits instead of looking for another Zelazney book."
1,Dung of Amber,"Not only does this book mock the late Roger Zelazny's imagination, but it goes too far in mocking any legitimate author that has ever put in the hard work and dedication it takes to create a serious novel. Mr. Betancourt obviously lacks the talent, intelligence and just plain honest work when it comes to writing. This extremely thin, lackluster attempt is bad enough to set the art of writing back one hundred years. I have never, ever been so disappointed in a book in my entire life. There is no plot, no characters, no atmosphere, and no discernible conflict. What else could possibly go wrong? Oh, much, much more! Not only does Mr. Betancourt completely fail to bring anything new or interesting to the table, but he manages to get things from Zelazny's world totally wrong! There are better writers out there in high school, every high school in the entire world!"
5,I didn't think anyone could do this,"Do what? Write a book as close to Roger Zelazny as this. And so faithful to the original series. But John Betancourt succeeded beyond my wildest dreams. I am a big Zelazny fan and I had some doubts about this book before I opened it. No more. I am about to order the second book in the series right now.Of course the books conform to the older ones... they have to! This is a prequel. Makes them harder to write. But other than re-reading the original 10 books for the 10th time (well, only the seventh or eighth, actually), this is the best we can expect unless someone is channelling Roger Z directly from the afterworld.It's recommended that you read the originals first --- then start these. You are expected to know what's coming, and enjoy it.WPG"
1,A 11 year old could have done better,"Betancourt dosn't even bother to follow the workings of Amber's universe, it is like ignoring gravity, or writing a Star Wars novel with Star Trek transporters.Did Betancourt even read the original series? or did he just have someone outline them for him? A few days of research and reading would have made this more than a cheap way to rip off Amber fans for some money.My advice, Run far away from this book."
1,Dung of Amber,"This book stunk. There are only about a million or so psuedo-medieval fantasy stories out there that are more interesting, more creative and more intelligently written than this [weak] excuse for a book. John, here is some advice: Most of your readers are not 12 years old! They would enjoy a moderately fleshed-out character or two in a space of 300 pages! You showed absolutely NO work or ambition in the copping of a few ideas of Zelazny's while not even making an effort to bring a conflict or plot to life. This is an insult to readers and writers alike and should have been mailed back stamped ""REJECTED"" by the editor. Anyone who has ever enjoyed a S.F. or fantasy novel will find nothing new here. It reads like a bad D&D campaign."
3,Pretty darn close to original,"I'll admit I read this prepared to be disappointed and maybe that is why I was so pleased with 'The Dawn of Amber.' Betancourt follows the Zelazny Amber formula for the first half of the book, but I found myself really getting into the second half of the book and the ending was perfect (considering this the first of the trilogy)."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A young Oberon, going by a different name, is living in Shadow and unaware of his true heritage. Soon, he meets the mysterious Dworkin, and he begins to learn what is going on. This is a prequel series to Amber, exploring its origins. It is nowhere near as good, however, and the editing is a bit dodgy."
1,poor quality,I guess you get what you pay for. The item looks nice and would be a great idea if the sound quality was any good. I could barely hear.
1,EARBUD RIPOFF,THE EARBUDS WERE DEFECTIVE. DON'T BUY THEM. THE PLUGS DON'T FIT PROPERLY INSIDE THE JACK! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THEM.
4,Soft,I haven't used it yet but i think it will be very nice. The price was right and I got what I expected.
2,Does NOT SHIP to Hawaii!!!,"I would have LOVED to have this product but it does NOT ship to HAWAII. Now, ""I don't like it"". Guess I have to go with EAGLE CREEK to by a money belt."
5,great money belt,"I got one of these for a trip to Italy after hearing many people complain of pickpockets. It was very comfortable to wear, easy to clean, and held up well for 11 days. No complaints at all."
4,Very Good functionality - Can be detected at airports,"I have owned and used 2 of these in Ukraine and Peru (I like the black, under a black T-shirt). I like it very much, It keeps money etc safe and dry, and very hidden. I wear it under and undershirt (T-shirt). Functionality is excellent. I use it as a third wallet: one dummy wallet with a few small bills in a back pocket; a small front pocket wallet for daily activity and this as a hidden redoubt for large bills, passport card, and my passport when I do not need to have it in hand.My only concern is the money belt can be detected in airports, i.e., in the San Jose, Costa Rica airport, during a hand and wand search when changing planes. At first I thought the zipper may have been metal, I am not sure. But, this was possibly due to my passport card and protective sleeve being inside at the time. Not a perfect item, but very close."
5,rick steves money belt,was good nice and thin and came in plenty of time before our trip. I wore mine but my husband who said to order them did not use his.
2,Quality is pretty poor...,"This is pretty much a piece of junk. I just returned from a 10 day vacation, and it is already falling apart. The plastic moisture barrier is just placed inside, not stitched-in, so it just gets in the way when getting into and out of the wallet. The zipper handles are so small that manipulating them efficiently is difficult and frustrating. I would definitely NOT purchase this item had I been able to test it before the purchase. Rick Steves has dropped the ball on this one."
1,Don't buy this!,This is the worst money belt. One of the zippers broke within 6 days of use. Had to use safety pins to keep it closed. Do not buy this money belt.
1,DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT,If I could get away with giving this product a negative star I would. I purchased this item for my recent trip to Europe after reading Rick Steves best of Europe in which he mentions getting a money belt. While we were in Paris I put both mine and my boyfriends passports in the belt along with ALL of our cash. Well...we went on one of those private at night tours that he recommends in the book and we got in and out of the car several times. Well the clasp came undone and the money belt slid right off. If it were not for the driver bringing it to my attention the trip could have been a major disaster.
5,plastic surprise,"Used on bike trip touring the Loire Valley. Plastic insert worked well protecting all from sweat!Very comfortable, usually placed pouch on my lower back."
4,Silk Money Belt,"I thought it was very good, it worked as it was intended. The front two pockets are a bit small, my passport would not fit in them, they are good size for Credit cards though."
2,holey money belt! flimsy fabric tears too easily,"Within a few weeks of use, my credit cards had started wearing holes in the flimsy fabric. A few weeks later, the sharp edges of crisp bills had begun doing the same in the money pouch. And the cheap clip unfastens too easily, so sometimes you feel something crawling down your leg--it's your passport and cash, about to fall into the street. Not recommended."
4,Comfortable to wear all day,"I love reading rick stoves travel guides. They are always full of good tips on traveling, including how to hide your money! Well I don't like carrying purses when I travel, there is so much other stuff to carry and worry about. So I bought this money belt because it was silk and supposed to be better than the cheap poly ones. It is indeed very comfortable. I can wear it all day and it doesn't get hot or sweaty. The money inside doesn't get wet either. It has two sections which is good for separating different currencies or receipts, and also a nice holder/part for credit cards and ID and room keys. Thanks Rick!"
3,better than expected,A small delay in receiving the 2 money belts but well worth the wait as we don't travel for another 3 months.They are great and will give us peace of mind in the pickpocket hotspots of Europe.
3,Ok...but not great!,I went on a cruise and bought this to keep with me at all times. It definately has pro's and consPROSKeeps your things concealedkeeps your hand free (no lugging around a purseCONSUncomfortableDoesn't stay in placeyou get sweaty in the place that it's atreally flimsy...one week of wear is all it has in it!the band is way too long.
1,Buckle is worthless,I just tried mine on. The little plastic buckle will not hold. The part of the buckle that is supposed to lock is nothing but a folded piece of plastic which is supposed to act like a spring and lock into the mating piece. The mating piece is so poorly made that it just doesn't lock. A money belt that will not lock aroud the waist isn't really a money belt at all. One star is an over rating. Buy this one only if you want to carry your money belt in your pocket.
2,"Sweaty, moves around a lot","I'm clearly not going to be a money belt guy. The silk was nice, but in order to make this water/sweat proof they needed to add a layer of nylon behind it. That layer of plastic makes a nice sweaty spot (and I'm not really a sweaty person, either.)In addition, it never seems to stay in one place. It's always hiking up or shifting around to the side. I've tried behind the back, under the belly, on the side, etc. and it never quite seems to be happy with where it is.I think I'll stick with my slightly less secure, but significantly more comfortableEagle Creek Travel Gear Neck Pouchinstead."
4,"Your money, safe as a joey in it's momma's pouch.","I bought this for my husband prior to embarking on our long awaited honeymoon to Europe. I'm a big traveler and in my travels I've learned it's good to do your best not to look like a tourist. This item was key to making sure we had all the documents and cash we needed and kept us from having to resort to typically tourist things like the dreaded fanny pack.It was hot in Italy and my husband was very happy that this item was made from great, light weight and breathable material. He also felt like he'd foiled the would-be pick pockets in Florence!I'd reccomend this to any travler, or even a hiker or runner. You can easily move arround without even noticing this item.. and yet it can carry all you need. The only draw back was that it was not long enough for the size of the Euro bills."
4,Can you put a pricetag on added security?,"Whether or not one of these belts is necessary is everyone's own opinion, but if you are afraid of being pick-pocketed (or mugged), then pick one of these up. Material is comfortable and light. The ""plastic sleeve"" inside is a great idea, but mine ""bunched up"" after only a few days and it never really got back to normal. However, if you want to be safe, definitely grab one of these and you won't regret it."
5,"worked perfectly, and it couldn't be seen.","We used this as our ""back up"" to our Pacsafe MetroSafe 200 Anti-Theft Shoulder Bag, which we purchased at the same time as this belt.The belt is soft, flexible, and easy to wear just behind the belt line, where it's safest.Added peace of mind!"
4,Silky and sleek,Very comfortable material and so sleek you may forget you are wearing it. I wore it for 17 days straight and most of the time forgot I had it on. The zippers are placed so that you can open a pocket without having to look to see which one you are using. Credit cards easy to get to - plenty of room for passports (I carried two) and lots of cash and other documents. Strap is extremely long - will fit any person I have ever seen. Only complaint - after a couple of weeks hiking in 100 degree heat the plastic liner did stick closed - but that was also great to keep the sweat out of my documentation - so I don't know if it was that bad. Love that fact that I took out the plastic liner and threw it in the washer. Ready for my next trip with my pouch!!
3,Didn't use it,I purchased this thinking I'd use it for my couple week trip to Spain and never even put it on. I never felt unsafe just keeping my passport and wallet in my front pocket and just being aware when it came to tight scenarios such as the bus or train.I give it three stars because I don't really have an opinion on it. I put it on before I left and it seemed like it would have been ok but it just seemed like it wasn't necessary.
1,Waste of $25---Broke on First Use---Now It is $13!!--Terrible Quality,"Worst travel product I have ever bought (and at Amazon no less!). Cheaper than cheap in quality, the plastic clasp (to hold the darn thing together around your waist obviously!) broke the first time I used it on our recent 2-week retirement trip to Europe. Not just came loose dropping the money belt into my shorts, but was absolutely unfixable/useless after that. And the quality of the rest of this cheapo belt is nothing to write home about either (cheap zippers, etc.). Paid $25 for this junk in August--now it's $12.95!Rick Steves New Silk Money Belt. Tres angry indeed. Too late to return. Disgusting."
4,Works fairly well,"It's comfortable, fits well, and fit everything in it that I needed to carry. The one problem is something I believe another reviewer mentioned. If you walk all day with it and get sweaty then the stuff inside will get damp. Specifically in my case, this happened to my money (no big deal) and my passport (more problematic). So it is a good idea (like the other reviewer mentioned) to put things in a plastic baggy first if you don't want them to get wet."
1,Non-Secure Security,"Despite claims in the product description, the plastic buckle on the strap of this money belt is of poor quality and easily comes apart leaving the money belt loose under your clothes. Spend more and purchase a belt with more secure buckle to avoid disaster."
2,Did not last.,"The second time I wore this money belt, the clasp on it broke. Fortunately, I had some safety pins with me and could use them to hold the belt on. Essentially, I can no longer use it for future trips."
3,"Not great, but okay.","The silk irritated my skin if I sweated (still have the rash) and mine omitted the plastic sleeve which meant that anything I carried got sweat-soaked as well. I'd use it again, but only for certain environments. Zipper placement wasn't great, but was manageable. The separate compartments for credit-type cards were a plus."
5,Great Product,"This moneybelt is everything the previous positive reviews indicated. In nearly three weeks of traveling in Europe and the Middle East (conditions with high humudity and high temperatures), I found the belt to be exceedingly comfortable to wear, so much so that I often forgot I was wearing it. It's three pockets were very handy to use to segregate my small bills of cash and coins from my credit cards, and then I was able to comfortably carry my passport and other papers in the larger back pocket."
3,Not made of Silk...,"The money belt is ""100% Polyester"" according to the tag inside. Too bad I don't have time to exchange it. Other than that it looks like a usable money belt. The stitching appears secure, and its big enough to hold a passport. Lets hope it isn't as uncomfortable as I think it will be!"
4,Good,"Worked well, strap a little flimy but kept up, and was comfortable, held everything I needed money and passports I would but again"
5,A must have for the traveler,"I recently came back from a trip from Ireland and with the use of this money belt, it was probably one of the most useful items and perfect for protection without worrying about being pickpocketed or any money/important document being taken away. Prior to this, I had no idea that money belts were even out there and then I came across this silk money belt, just in time for my trip to Ireland The separate pockets were very convenient to separate the dollars and euros and small change as well and any card sized item in the bottom pocket on the lower part of the belt. I highly recommend it for the overall traveler."
4,Suitable for its purpose.,"Very simple and comfortable as a hidden belt should be. Main pocket should be a little larger, with plastic removable pouch/liner that is very practicle. 2 front small pockets are only good for money or maybe ID, as they are too small for anything else. Overall, good product, much better than other nylon crap."
3,"Fine, usable, but too tall for me","I had an old Rick Steves money belt from 2002 that I had used for years, but it was beginning to wear out, so I bought this new silk version. The silk part was fine, the straps were fine, but I found it too ""tall"" for me (went too far above the waist), making it bulkier and not as comfortable as I expected. Most disappointing was the plastic sleeve inside. Because it is so large, it immediately (on first wearing) curled over itself at the top and bottom, not keeping my bills as flat as my previous one did, and making it more difficult to take it out of the money belt. I found the two small zipped pockets in the front of the money belt useless. I'll use this during many trips in the future, I'm sure, but I'm not as happy with it as I expected to be. Maybe it's better suited to a man's body?"
2,disappointed,"We love Rick Steves books. The best investment for traveling. We thought his travel products would be just as great... We bought two money belts, one for each my husband and myself. The elastic is long which allows you to cut it to fit. My husband cut his to fit his 34"" waist. The buckle/ clasp broke the first time he wore it! Because I had options for carrying my belongings, he replaced the broken buckle with the buckle from the unused second belt. It broke as well! He ended up rigging the thing up with a lanyard from his convention name badge. This make-shift solution held up for the remainder of our three week trip. On the positive side, the silk was comfortable and the compartments were perfect for travel documents and money. Just replace the buckle and it is a pretty good product!"
1,too fragile,"On the surface it seemed a good idea, however the clasp is *very* fragile and broke after the first day.Not recommended as there are much sturdier ones out there"
4,rick steves money belt silk,It gets wet from sweat- but its comfortable- fits the passport and money easily and has a separate compartment for credit cards and ids (not water proof)
2,Too small for passport!,"The product was basically what I wanted - an under the clothes money belt and secure place for cash and a passport. The product has several pockets, presumably for cash and a passport and other important documents. However, the pockets are too small for a passport. So, it really only has one usable pocket. The size of my US passport has not changed in the past 20 years, so obviously the design of the product is flawed."
4,Money Belt,"This is worry free product. It made my trip to Europe worry-free.It should have water-proof lining, to get documents and money from getting wet in the rain.Otherwise a must to carry for trips to any foreign country."
3,Lightweight and seems comfortable,"I purchased for overseas travel but I didn't need it. It turns out that all the hotels had wall safes in the rooms so I only took out what I needed each day. It feels comfortable and lightweight, and I'll keep it in case I need it in the future."
3,Not bad. slightly irritating,This was a bit overkill for going to Alaska. At no time did we feel like this was needed for this wonderful location. I can see how this can be pretty important in a less developed country. I found it to be a little awkward to use and it irritated my skin slightly.
2,Moderate usefulness,"This is a good product if you're traveling to a place with high crime and are not very aware of your surroundings. I'm a little paranoid when traveling though. I assume everyone is a criminal waiting to rob so I'm always aware of what's going on around me. I used this thing for a few days during a month of travel in Europe then it spent the remaining 3 1/2 weeks in the bottom of my bag. With the use of ATMs and credit cards, there is no need to carry large sums of cash. My passport was secured in my camera bag, which never left my side, so no worry of losing that.Build quality on the item is pretty good however for those people looking to buy it. Embarrassment factor is extremely high when you get fined for having improper tickets on the European train system and you have to reach into your money belt for extra cash to pay the fine."
5,great design/great product!!!,"I purchase 2 of this for me and my husband prior to our trip to southeast asia.I have tried other material and brand but we like this one the most.Like the other reviewers said "" you never know you're wearing it under your clothes"".Great product!"
4,money belt,"Have not use it yet, but it seems to be satisfactory.Have not used one before so not sure if really necessary."
4,Just fine...,"I will say the belt it's just fine, the material it's very soft so it feel comfy, but don't see a remarkable plastic area as described by others, anyway I pack it with some plastic zipper bags to protect the documents and keep away the money of sweat, to avoid that horrible smell of the wet money. I will recommend it if you are looking for an inexpensive solution, otherwise, try a different one."
5,great item for a traveler,"I bought this item last year for my travel around Asia. I heard about how travelers were prime targets of pick pockets and I wanted some protection. I placed my passport and large cash denominations in the money belt. I didn't get anything stolen. But wearing the belt gave me piece of mind so that I could actually enjoy myself. I still recommend carrying a wallet with you and putting a day's worth of cash in it. Then you won't have to reach into your money belt and give away your secret. Also, if you get mugged, hopefully they'll be satisfied with the wallet and leave you alone."
5,travel,I loved the item I would recommed to a friend. It is a great item for travelling. Just you need.
4,Good,The item came to me in excellent shape. Communication was good with the company I purchased the item through. Delivery time was excellent.The only issue was that the company could not provide the color that I wanted but they did communicate well to advise that I could purchase the money belt in tan right away or wait until the item on backorder could be filled in the black color I wanted. I was glad to be able to have this choice and I was very happy with the communication.
3,Not for everyone,"I brought this money belt with me to China recently and only used it for two days. It was helpful on the ""sleeper"" (overnight) buses where theft often occurs, but it wasn't particularly comfortable to wear during the day. First, the waist belt was extremely long and would not tighten enough to fit my waist well. I'm an average-sized girl in my 20s, and when I adjusted it to fit my waist, there was almost a foot of leftover strap that dangled unpleasantly (I had to use a binder clip to keep the leftover strap secure). Second, the belt was constantly shifting. I would suddenly find it up to my stomach rather than on my waist. This became quite annoying to me (especially when having to use the restroom), so I gave up and simply carried my passport in my purse (which I clutched tightly).The money belt was quite nice in terms of size and the material was comfortable, but note that it does not work well with everyone's body type."
5,Very good money belt,"I recently purchased this money belt for a trip to Europe. After reading Rick Steves book we were concerned about pick-pockets on Las Ramblas. The money belt allows you to hide the valuable items, and gave us peace of mind. After reading other posts, I was concerned about the sweating issues, and utility. For me, there was a little sweat (Europe in Summer, 90's)on some days but it quickly dried during the nighttime. It didnt get to the point where I needed to wash it on the trip. Key pointers; bring a ziplock bag and use it inside the money belt for passports; only put your really valuable items in there(Passports, credit card, cash). Keep some cash in your pocket for easy access, and store backup money in the belt. The belt was also pretty comfortable."
3,Postmodern mush,"If you believe in the postmodernist approach to history (which is a contradiction in terms, since a good postmodernist shouldn't believe in anything), you will find this collection rewarding. If, by contrast, you think postmodernism is rubbish, this will confirm your belief."
3,picture is unclear,It hard to tell the colors of this belt in the pic. I thought it was neutral shades of brown & tan. It is mulitcolor flowers on a brown belt. It does seem thinner in real life than in the pic also.
2,"too narrow, too small","I usually wear size 6-8- the medium didn't fitalso the belt is too narrow-about 1/2"". the description doesn't ever say width but in the photo it looks like it would be the usual 1"" or even 1 1/2""also the colors are a lot brighter than the pic, not duller and browner like i thought and hoped.giving it to my smaller mom."
1,unrealistic pic,belt looks nothing like it does in the pic lol very hideous my sis wanted to cry when she saw it lol
3,"Understandable, but hard to get into the flow","I had a hard time really getting into this translation by Paul Roche. He maintained the original iambic meter throughout the translation but varied the line lengths to such a degree that I found it very difficult to get into the poetic flow of the plays.My enjoyment of the tragic plays' content varied somewhat. In general they follow the formula of a character persisting in their thought/words/actions while others try to convince them to do otherwise with, well, tragic consequences for one or more of the characters. My favorite was ""Oedipus the King"" with its theme of the futility of trying to avert prophecies or alter fate. I also enjoyed how ""Philoctetes"" and ""Ajax"" filled in some of the missing plot pieces from the Trojan War stories of Homer's ""Iliad"" and Virgil's ""Aeneid"".I think I may try to find a different translation with closer adherence to the original line-lengths and see if that can raise my opinion of Sophocles from 3 stars to 4."
5,wonderful color and quality,"I'm always amazed by the great colors and great quality that you can find in the YSL brand.Those eye shadows are of course not an exception, and the price was great!!Shipping was fast and packing good, I recommend this seller."
5,The Bewitching twin,"Loved it! But you need to read all of Donna Fletchers novels to get a better understanding of the story. It picks up where 'The Daring Twin' left off. Donna is a talented writer who makes you not want to put her books down, so I read this one in a day!"
5,just as good as the first one,"just loved it, kept enthralled, besides where can one find such men but in books and someones imagination, thank you"
2,In Loving Memory Kool Rock Steady,"The album was the bomb. Because he was one of the best Dj in Chicago.He will all way be in our heart ever seen the day I meet him.I will like for this album to seel alot of copy.He will always bethe best DJ in Chicago and will be in our mind forever.Thank You,MiguelP.S Go out there and get tha album u will like it."
1,One single I'll never buy,"Another version of Canto Della Terra...this time Japanese!...has been brought forth, but it's got the ORIGINAL versions of both songs, which are already on the SOGNO CD, on this, unremixed. They're great songs, yes, but it's beyond me why one would pay the ridiculous price just to get two songs already available elsewhere. I don't have this single; just stick to the SOGNO album and DON'T waste your money on this."
5,BRRrrrrrratZ!!!,I am a 12 year old girl who loves this. I got it last Christmas and i still play with it with my friends at sleepovers and stuff. Its fun to experiment with makup and hairstyles. I reccomend getting this for all girls aged 9-13.
4,my choice,i think that these bratz are much better than barbies thats why when someone says they look like barbies i get mad.these are great to learn how to do your own hair and even when you grow up a hair dresser or a funky fasion designer as we all know bratz last year were on the top 10 toys this year its making its way to the top again with the bratz spa dana and the bed covers and board game also a sony pc gamebratz clotheslamps mp3plyers phonesand eitan and cobythe two new bratz boyz.
3,4 years old is too young for this toy,"My almost 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas from an Aunt and Uncle. I think she is far too young for it - I would not have opened it up yet (saving it until she's older) had she not begged and begged. I knew once it was out of the box she'd lose intrest in it and she did. I think it would be more suited to children from about 6 years.My daughter had real trouble just brushing it's hair without the head tipping over. The star comb is difficult for her to hold and use and I have to be the ""hairdresser"" while she watches. I haven't even attempted showing her the hair accessories or make-up.We've basically packed it up for now until my daughter is older. It was a lovely thought from her aunt and uncle who thought it would be perfect for my daughter since the box recommends it for 4 years plus but I would suggest that an age of about 6 and above would be more suitable."
2,Not happy!!,"I thought this toy was amazing when i saw it, then when i bought it, i thought it was okay, then about a couple of days later, i out grew it from bordome. I thought that i could still use the makeup on me (since it says you can) and i did for Halloween, and i could not get the glitter off of my face!! it took 2 days for it to completely come off. This is one of the worst Bratz toys that they made."
4,Excellent.,My only disappointment was some tunes I would like to have included... very good reason to release another one Richard!
1,"Porn without the um... well, porn.","I just saw this movie and couldn't believe how terrible it is. The plot is so much like the first one that this movie even has a 3-way sex scene like the first was famous for. The film was done so poorly that if you watch carefully you'll notice that right in the middle of the scene shoes suddenly appear on Maya's feet, whereas she had been barefoot only seconds earlier. If an entire cast and crew is too stupid to notice that, then you can just imagine how the rest of the film goes. Also, the whole idea of using rats to sabotage the electrical system in an airplane is too far-fetched to be believed. Avoid this at all costs."
1,Worst sequel ever!!,"Wild Things is one of my all time favorite thrillers, so I decided to give its sequel a try. My expectations were low, as WT2 went directly to video, but I could never imagine how bad this movie is. WT2 is like a low-budget copy of the first movie (threesome scene included) but with lame actors and stupid plot. From the very start you can't help but wonder if they actually wanted to make a thriller or a comedy. Extremely disappointing."
2,Good for laughs,"This is actually a terrible movie, but if you enjoy watching (mocking, laughing at) terrible movies while getting drunk with friends, this one's for you. Plus I kind of like B-movie great Susan Ward. Another great-awful drinking movie starring Ward: _The In Crowd_."
2,bad follow-up,"As good of surprise that the original movie was, Wild Tings 2 surprised us again- in the opposite way. May be expectations were high, but this movie proved to be swallow and predictible, something that the first was not. If you have not seen the first one then this one could be watchedwith some interest and thatshow it gets the second star. A movie about a spoiled rich girl that wants everything and will stop at nothing in order to do it."
1,One of the Worst,"Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. The acting and the dialogue are just comically bad. I really do wish more people saw this movie so it could take it's place among the worst movies of all time. One example of it horridness: Leila Arcieri (who is black) uses a white body double in the three-way scene with ""assets"" rather obviously half the size of hers. Just high comedy. I mean really, who is Leila Arcieri to use a body double. Watch this movie if you want to laugh. At it, not with it."
3,Not bad,"I've only seen the first Wild Thing till today. I just finished watching Wild Things 2 and I thought it was ok. I thought it was going to end just like the first Wild Thing ended. Because there were three people involved, just like the first Wild Thing. Out of the three one dies right away. Like the first Wild Things. But it didn't end like the fist Wild Thing. It was a little bite of a change from the first movie.I enjoyed it, I think I enjoyed it because I kept wondering how it was going to end and who was going to die next."
1,Some sequals should not be made....,"This is one of them. Like Grease 2, this is a bad example of why movies are made. It's like a Fred Flinstone get rich scheme that backfires violently. Seriously, this was a yawnfest. I was glad when it was over. To describe in one word? Lame."
3,Wild Things 2,"It's a movie that is certainly a sign of the times. It's a teen devises a way to get money type movie. It does contain murder and some skin. It won't win an Academy Award, but it's fun if you don't take it seriously."
4,GOOD,This movie has so many twist and turns its great! The cast is excellent and pretty! Go rent it then BUY it!!
4,Nice little camera,"Pros:Great resolutiongood colormodes are easily switchedaffordableAA battery, i.e. fits standard NiMH rechargeable batterySD card, 512 MB card can hold > 500 picturesCons:high Audio noise during video recordingLittle bit bulkyNote: be sure to get AA rechargeable batteries that has > 2000 mA-hr."
5,Wow this camera is great for kids under 13.,"I got this camera for my birthday this year. This camera has everything an expesive camera has. The only thing is on the video is that you can video tape sound ,but you can only hear it after you download the video onto the computer. Also, you can only zoom in really close and see it if you are about a couple feet up high. This is really great for children who want a digital camera."
5,"Great value, great pics, great mini movies for ages 10 - 100","I purchased this camera for my 14 year old for Christmas 2005 and what a purchase this was. It was her favorite gift last Christmas and it took great photos and mini movies. We also purchased a 1 gb memory card to go with it and I can't say enough about theeasy handling, great pictures and awesome short movies this inexpensive camera can take. When I sayinexpensive I mean for what this camera can do, it's well worth the money.Unfortunately her camera was stolen from her at a high school sponsored dance last night and she was devastated.If this camera does not turn up, I will be purchasing another one for her, for her 15th birthday coming in September. That's how much this camera is worth it.It's just the right size and quality for a 15 year old andolder.No complaints on this camera at all."
2,Poor Photo Quality,"Bought this camera earlier this year, and it's been nothing but trouble. Despite several adjustments and support from Kodak, I cannot take a decent photo for the life of me.Colors are always off and are never true to life, and you can almost rely on your photos being slightly blurry and out of focus.The loading dock is convenient and innovative, but not when Kodak's software crashes (which is often).I've used multiple digital cameras (namely Fuji and HP), and compared to them, the Kodak c330 is simply awful."
4,"Good, but what about the video?","I just recieved this camera yesterday and love everything about it except for the video. The product information made the claim that it also captured audio with the clip, but I have been unable to make this work. I have tried to get the sound to play when I review a video clip and get nothing. Has anyone else had this problem?Other than that, this is he best camera I have ever owned - many times better than my last SLR."
2,Washed out photos - poor quality for a kodak,"I got this camera as a christmas gift this year and was fairly pleased. I had been shopping around for a camera to make slideshows with, and my parents very generously bought one for me. I am no expert in photography, but I know when a camera takes bad pictures. I have an olive skin tone and green eyes, and the pictures completely washed out my skin, leaving only my eyes with color. Also, pictures of subjects farther away than 28"" came out dark and/or washed out as well. The color saturation is overwhelming, and I just couldn't take it. After a few trade ins between a couple other cameras I have finally stuck with a Sony Cyper-shot, which is a good camera. The kodak C330 is good for those who are looking for a bargain, and don't care about true to color skin tones. But if you'd like to save a hundred dollars, stick with Kodak's disposable cameras and you'll get better pictures."
2,Poor picture and build quality,"Bought this as a gift. Kodak has received JD Power awards for being the most user friendly camera maker. That part was true. It had great little blurbs for every presetting to describe what it was intended to be used for. In addition, on its face, it was a good value: 3x zoom and 4MP all for under $150.But the picture quality was so poor. I compared it to my several-year-old Canon A70 and it was really no contest. I was embarassed that I even bought the camera as a gift and told my friend that I would return it and get them a different camera.Additional things: extremely short battery life and poor build quality. For an additional $20, you can get a Canon A510 that is built much better and has superior image quality. Take a look at some of the sample photos that users have uploaded on that camera.I'm glad that others are enjoying this camera, though. I'm a big fan of Kodak normally... but I just can't support this camera."
1,Thanks for nothing...,"I loved this camera for the length of the warranty. The day it expired, so did the camera. I'd put the batteries in and it would turn on, then immediately shut off. Kodak suggested I buy their brand of batteries. I did, and it still didn't work. Useless."
4,good for the price,"Simple, easy to operate tough, perfect for trips, kids and the price is right. By the way it takes CRV3 batery which will last for hundreds of pictures!"
3,Basic Camera,This camera is a good basic camera for beginners. It was a gift for one of my grandchildren. Great little camera but hard on batteries. As usual the Amazon supplier service was excellant!!
4,OK point and shoot,I bought this to take to Germany and it did pretty good. I wouldn't get this one if you are wanting to do action photos though. The only other weakness is the zoom but for the price you can't beat it.
2,Fine,"This camera is fine, picture wise. But it eats batteries WAY too fast. We constantly have to change them, and it won't work w/ rechargeable ones. Plus you have to wait forever to take two pictures in a row, it's very annoying, especially when you're trying to catch something fast. I will not buy Kodak again."
2,Terrible,I've had this camera for awhile but if your trying to take pictures of your kids you are going to hate this. The shutter speed is so sloww that you will almost always miss the shot you want to take. Not to mention if anyone slightly moves ...the picture ends up blurry. I used rechargable energizer batteries.. this ends up quite an expense ... i just wish you could plug it in or dock it somehow to charge it. extremely frustrating. It gets worse n worse over time... probably won't last you more than 2 years at the MOST. if you forget your SD card for any reason... you can only store 6 photos on it's internal memory. I would never buy any EasyShare every again. My sister had a different model and that died on her not long after she bought it also. If you are looking for suggestions... Look for a Nikon coolpix or Casio Exilim... they have some very good affordable options as well as some more extreme options. Don't waste your money guys...
3,Camera,Brought this for my daughter as her first camera.Very pleased so far. easy to use and pictures are good.
2,Not So Great,"I bought this camera a little over a month ago after selling my previous Canon Powershot A80. Compared to the Canon, this camera is terrible. It takes mediocre pictures that are usually washed out and the white balance is just flat out bad. I sincerely wish I did not sell my last camera, as it was in such good condition. I do plan to get rid of this camera, and buy a new one... Fast.If you are looking for a good, compact camera, Canon, Sony Cybershots, and Fujis are good choices. Kodaks just don't come through with good pictures, at all.The battery life is also terrible. I used rechargable batteries, and they still only lasted about an hour and I was only able to take a few pictures with then having to delete most of them.This camera is not worth the money at all, I suggest that anyone who is looking at this camera keep looking."
4,Great First Camera,"I was a photographer in a former life(high school), almost went into it professionally. I'm much happier with a SLR in my hands than a point and shoot, but we purchased this for our 9 year old son so we could finally enter the ""digital age"". And this little camera does not disappoint in that respect.Who needs a Polaroid camera anymore, when you can take a picture and print it out on a printer at home? Too cool. This Kodak has a nice optical zoom, though I have trouble using the digital zoom. You can't use the digital zoom through the viewfinder, only the lcd screen on the back. Since I'm still in the dark ages, I'm probably the only person left that has a problem using a lcd screen (:For the price, this camera meets all our needs."
3,Comparing picture quality with an equivalent Olympus.,The problems were in the following areas compared to the Olympus FE-1001) Exposure accuracy missing sometimes.2) Over-saturated colors.3) Non-accurate white balance on many occasions.4) Color accuracy not quite there - yellow standstone building can land up looking whitish presumably because of white balance problems. Same scene shot with an FE-100 looks perfect.5) Lens not as sharp as the FE-100 lensBoth the FE-100 and c330 have been purchased in my family and I have used both very extensively. For picture quality - I'll go for the FE100 in a heartbeat.
3,Battery eater,"How can you rate a product, which often turns out to be dead right when you have a great shot? It is very unreliable in the sense that it gobbles up batteries. It happened to me so many times that my camera has run out of batteries when I want to take pictures! Carry around a stock of batteries when you use this thing. I would recommend taking batteries out after each use."
2,HUH!!,"OK, MY MOM AND DAD JUST bought this camera. Worked fine!!! Until one day my dad turns it on pushes the button to take a picture..... goes blank, nothin!! We do not know what to do!! someone else sayed the same thing!! sorry kodak but i trust the camera any more."
5,Great item,Easy to use and the dock is great for syncing and charging the camera. We use it at our office to photograph patients for our electronic chart and we get great results and its easy to use.
4,Well worth the money.,I was very happy with the Kodak C330 Digital Camera. It was very easy to use and I was very impressed with the quality of the pictures. I would highly reccomend this camera to anyone who is looking for inexpensive digital camera!! It is a great bargin!
4,Great starter digital camera,"I liked this product. It's my first digital camera, so I don't have a basis for comparison, but it's easy to use and easy to figure out. If you're a newbie like me, know that it goes through batteries like crazy and you'll need additional memory (like an SD card) but the rechargeable batteries and card are not expensive, and they're worthwhile investments."
5,"This is a summary of the Jazz Butcher's ""Bloody Nonsense""","I couldn't find a space to review this incredible album, (yes, I said album), called ""Bloody Nonsense"", which came out 10-12 yrs. ago, so I thought I'd type it here. I have some Jazz Butcher from that era, and all I can say is ""Bloody Nonsense"" is incredible. Can't find it anywhere--album or CD, and don't ever hear anything about it, which is a shame, because people are missing a mighty great bunch 'o tunes!Just wondering if anyone is familiar w/it. Ciao---Audio"
3,new vs. old listeners,"Not a bad album for those who never heard of the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy (JBC). But why buy an album of songs that you should still be able to get in thier original format on the original recordings? Most of these songs are on albums that are not yet out of print or are at least locateable.""Draining the Glass"" will give you an idea of the older, better stuff when Max Eider was still with the band.Anyone out there who can provide me with a copy/tape of Sex & Travel + Scandal in Bohemia, would give me something to live for. Searched Los Angeles, San Diego, Philly, Baltimore, New York, And Washington D.c. to no avail (out of print). Will pay, or happily swap copies of other rare stuff in my collection (I'm talking 60's, 70's and some early 80's) e-mail me."
2,not as good...,"After reading ""Ill Met by Moonlight"" and being amused by it's interesting intermingling of the fairy world and the world of William Shakespeare, I looked forward to the next installment. Although as well written, the story was much darker. The main character is evil itself and the notion of evil. I would rather read something a little more light-hearted. All of the characters seem to lose whatever goodness they posessed in the first book and give in to the 'chaos' taking hold of their world. Ms. Hoyt could have taken a totally different direction with the fantasy and explored the more positive aspects of the fairy realm."
5,Sof Feet,"This is one of the best products that I have tried to keep my feet soft, especially during the winter months. I have ordered it over and over again. My mom always used vaseline but I bought a jar for her and she loves it too. We also use it on our hands and cuticles -it's the best"
5,Loved it for 14 years!,"I have really dry skin and need a thick cream. I've used this cream for 14 years and haven't found anything better. A little goes a really long way and the jar last a long time. It is great on any dry spots: feet, hands, elbows. It has a pleasant scent and works magic for me!"
3,One good cd for the price of two.,The Stockholm performance is great in spots but the Luzern performance is barely audible through the hiss. Caveat emptor.
3,Not perfect but it worked,"I had a heck of a time finding a brake piston compression tool for my Mazda 3. I purchased this one in the hopes that it would do the job. The good news is that I managed to make it work. The bad news is that it did not come with an attachment that fit the holes on my brake piston very well. There was one that just barely worked if I kept enough tension on the system. Instead of taking just a minute or two per side it took me about 10 minutes. Still, having this tool made it MUCH easier than it would have otherwise been."
4,Caliper Service Kit,"On a scale of 10 I would give this an 8. The discs it has doesn't cover all car models adequately enough but with a little modification of the main adaptor head, you can make it work for some off brand vehicles. The quality of material seems to be high with a decent anti-corrision finish. Definitely worth the $30-$40 price range it's sold at."
5,Works for 07 Mustang,"I used this for my 2007 Ford Mustang GT after the dealer recommended tool failed to do the job. This kit included the right fitting to go on the T handle, and it simultaneously rotates and compresses the caliper piston when you turn the handle. Note that I found I had to rotate the collar every few turns to keep it snug against the piston, because the piston compressed faster than the T handle advanced into the collar. Without a tool like this, the job would have been impossible, because Ford's design makes the pistons incredibly difficult to compress, and I couldn't apply enough pressure by hand with a ratchet to compress it while simultaneously rotating. Note that I found that even with this tool, I needed to use a pipe to give myself enough leverage to rotate the T-handle. (But this is Ford's fault. The tool worked as intended and it was cheap!)"
3,Not for Vipers,Not that it is advertised as working on a 92-02 Dodge Viper but I was hoping it would. Pins are a little wide to line up. Seems well made for China manufacturing. Case is nice.
5,Works as expected.,Item works just as expected. No more using pliers or vice grips to do the job. Same goes for not needing two people (at times)!I'd recommend this for sure!
3,Good Telling of the Legend with some flaws,"I am a big fan of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and have always enjoyed the classic Disney cartoon. However, am always on the lookout for a good live action version of the story. After watching this one, I think it is a good version, the only things lacking were the chase at the end (it left a lot to be imagined) and the fact that the Brom Bones character was not ""Rough and Tough"" enough . However, it does stick to the legend very well.Cheers!"
3,The Real Story,"This version is pretty much what author Washington Irving had originally written. It is the exact opposite of the Tim Burton film. This film, while niely made, looks and feels like a cheap PBS production. It's great fun for families, that's for sure, but far from being a classic or gripping. I think, after seeing Burton's film, we sorta want that gothic horror film feel that he created. Not here. What this is is a faithful adaption of Irving's story. I love the story and every shape and form it comes in, but I prefer Tim Burton. Still, a very faithful adaption of the story."
2,Faithful but dull,"This made for TV Canadian adaptation of the Washington Irving story is more faithful than the Tim Burton movie. (Of the many things that were wrong with Tim Burton's version, perhaps the most jarring was the decision to made the headless horseman a real person, when in the book it is clear it is a prank to scare Ichabod Crane out of the village). Unfortunately, the fact that this is a faithful version does not necessarily mean that it is an interesting film to watch. In fact, it is pretty dull. The unknown actor portraying Crane doesn't help a lot, either. (Other actors in the movie are more appealing). Still, if you have read the original story, you might be interested to watch this version."
4,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,It is a Hallmark production and that makes the difference.Very good story - sticks with the real story line of the book.Would recommend for this time of year -- October - and Halloween.Thanks
3,Not what I expected,"This is a pretty accurate portrayal of the Sleepy Hollow legend but not what I really expected. Ichabod Crane is not very likeable and by the end of the film you are anxiously awaiting the Headless Horseman. Brahm Bones is portrayed as a very likeable fellow which is a contrast of other versions of the legend. The ending was a bit of a let down, but overall the movie is worth a watch. However if you can catch it on tv you might decide that it's not something that you would be interested in before you spend your money on it."
1,Boring....,I bought this movie for my 7th grade class because we were doing ledgends. They were bored out of their heads....
2,"Very close to original story, but very slow for kids","Well done production. Very close to the original story, but possibly too close.Moves very slow and my kids were too bored to stay with it until the action at the end. And, just like the original story, the action at the end is not long enough or strong enough to pay off the movie."
2,"A random, unedited collection","I can do no better than to quote a reviewer of another of Mr. Schulman's books. ""The book contains very little material written [originally] for this edition; rather, it's a compilation of various unpleasant e-mail threads and letters to the editor. It seriously aggravated me to have paid for a book containing verbatim transcripts of junk I could have read for free on the Internet. Mr. Schulman is bright and makes some strong arguments, but overall the work is shoddy -- petulant, unscholarly, and devoid of editing.""This book is more of the same: random notes and web postings bound together and sent to the printer. It is unfortunate, as Mr. Schulman is clearly a thoughtful proponent of liberty.I would highly recommend his fiction, particularly ""Alongside Night"", however."
4,The winter room,"The beging is boring. But as you go forther in the book gets better. I don't want to make or infulowens you to buy this book or any other book, if you wern't planing on buying a book. So that is all I'll tell you!"
1,Didn't work for me,"Fleas are a tough bug to beat. I wont say this is a horrible product as it has worked in my parents home. I will say, however, that you need to choose your product wisely or you will be spending a fortune. In my 1,000 sq ft apt with 12 ft ceilings and wood floors, three cans did not work or seem to make a dent. If I had 6 cans, maybe it would have gone better. But I was not going to spend that much.I wouldn't recommend this product for an infestation or a home with high ceilings. I'm actually not sure what I would recommend this product for."
1,Does not Work,I bought this because some tenants of mine brought flea infested animals into my basement and throughout the house I have a 2 story duplex and set off 8 foggers out of 9 throughout the house and they did not kill the fleas but only subdued them for 3 days tops! Very disappointed with this product!
1,poor product,This item almost lasted a whole drive to work! But it didn't. It stopped working on me the first time I tried using it but it did make a pretty sweet basketball when I shot it into the trash.
2,Maybe I should have bought one from Cingular...,"So I bought this as a cheap attempt to replace my wall charger that my cat chewed through.I recieved it for the quoted price, but within 3 weeks the piece that plugs into your phone popped apart. No luck trying to put it back together either.I would say 99 cents is a great price, but don't plan on using this forever."
3,Watch Out,"""The Twisted Cross"" is an excellent documentary on the life and reign of Adlof Hitler. The vocabulary used is definitely high school level. However, the sound creates a real problem for classroom use. Whenever there is music used it is twice the volume of the spoken word. It was loud enough that the classes next to mine could hear the music thru the walls. Constantly adjusting the volume is a problem."
3,More for entertainment than education,"With its clever title and thick, square layout, ""Dogalog"" grabs your attention right away on the shelves of your favorite bookstore, and a cursory perusal in the aisles will likely sway dog lovers to grab a copy.Although a functional, if not totally accurate (as others have noted already) resource, the book's strengths are its array of colorful photos and quick facts on dog breeds. Hence, this book is more for entertainment than education.Younger dog fanciers will especially enjoy flipping through the book. Anyone looking for information on what type of canine to adopt or rescue, however, will find a starting place here, but should expand his or her research to more in-depth sources."
5,Relief,"Fast delivery, surprised me. This may sound funny but, I bought this to give my dog some relief from bug bites. I'd forgotten that this works great ! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009R5B8A/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,Bought it to keep the mosquitoes away,"Yup, keeping away mosquitoes. A bit oily for me and the smell isn't the best (just my view). The product packaging (pump, etc) still works over the course of two months."
5,Avon SSS Original Oil with Pump,"How easy to moisten your skin and apply a bug repellent (naturally) at the same time! I was a bit skeptical that this would actually repel bugs, but I had heard so many people claim it worked, that I just had to give it a try! Thankfully I was wrong with my skepticism, it REALLY worked!"
2,Not original,"New thin stuff. So aggravating when they say original. Shipping was timely. I wonder who said SSS is perfect, we so have to ruin it."
2,This has mineral oil....and does nothing to Mosquitos,"This has no effect on mosquitos thought it would be a repellentwith a nice smell , I read many times that mineral oil clogs pores and induces pimples and acne which I am prone to. Regarding softness , it does make your skin so soft .."
2,Macho Metal,The songs on the first CD of this compilation all begin slow with the tempo building up witch is very annoying for the Metal band. Most of them have no structure and the singer is all in Macho style type of Vocals.There a couple of good tunes here from the first two albums.
5,Holy Crap!!,"This is what a greatest hits package should be. The songs flow together seamlessly, even the live ones fit right into the mix with the studio tracks. Overall a great collection of Iced Earth tunes that rock from begining to end. The only very small thing I have to complain about is the booklet that it comes with. It's so packed with stuff, it just fits into the case and I mean just fits *lol*. The band logo is also a sticker on the outer cd cover and not part of the jacket? Anyway other than that this package is worth every penny.BUY IT NOW!!"
2,Don't bother,"This album was released shortly before Iced Earth moved to a new record label. This is, essentially, just one last cash in attempt by their older label. Not much of the track listing makes sense (like putting the song Damien on the disc titled The Blessed), but they did put most of the bands best songs on here. You would be much better off buying the three disc live album Alive in Athens, of Days of Purgatory."
5,All I can say is PAIN KICKS,"I just saw them in concert and it was not just a concert, they turned it into a party. This cd will do just about the same. The music is great and the lyrics are funny. Buy and help support a ska band that rocks!!!!"
4,An outstanding review of the research on brain asymmetry,"Hellige does a superb job of reviewing the field of hemispheric asymmetry. This book is well written and has much to offer to the serious researcher or just the laymen interested in the brain.I am looking forward to a new edition, that will include the more recent research on the topic."
3,Better than average Italian pop disc,"San Remo discs are a great way to familiarize yourself with some great Italian pop, not only from newcomers, but established artists as well. This disc has probably 7 or 8 fairly good selections. Nicolai, Ruggiero, Masini and Tatangelo have some great selections. Give it a listen and then start finding complete discs from these artists all over Amazon"
5,SinisterCHic,"Clearly you have no clue about where house music originated and where it evolved, do you honestly think there is only one type of house?? There are so many sub-genres of house, don't get me wrong I love the disco stuff too, I love it. But you have to take it for what its worth, ""Hard House"" was popular here in Chicago, years ago, this cd was made back in 97' and since then house music has evolved as a whole. So who ever buys this cd is already educated on what Hard House is and who CZR is, who has been a legend in the house scene. And as far as ""some cultures"" I really hope you're not referring to race, making it seem that because he is hispanic it would make a difference in the music. So before you start trying to say what ""House Music"" really is, educate yourself before hand."
1,Total Garbage!,"This is an example of how some cultures take a form of music, use the popular brand name ""house music"" and commercialize it for profit. At best, this is acid-tripping rave music! There is no soul, no feeling, no vocals (repititious headaching samples) and nothing CLOSE to house music.If you want House Music try: Frankie Knuckles, Masters at Work Remixs of 70's Disco, and even Steve Silk Hurley. Not this money-wasting garbage!"
3,A student's review,"This book consists of ten different chapters which were written by different authors and edited and compiled for publication. The book offers general but solid information about planning for and implementing technology in a K-12 environment. I found the book to be very well organized and easy to read. The basic ""soft information"" presented in the book is still applicable and useful. However, the date (age) of the book means that most of the resources and references to specific technology are no longer current and appear to be out-of-date. This book is useful in providing historical or background information to technology in schools but a more current resource should be employed to provide a realistic look at the current state of technology integration in schools today."
4,Sub-Terrain Metallic Monster Music,Big dark sounding beats. Great to listen on headphones in the tube
5,Better than expected!,Great! These are good quality! They work very well! They can be used multiple times! I would order this again!
5,For Halloween fun,"Painted it with glow in the dark paint. Then used red paint to put bloody handprints all over it. Wore it with a gas mask. ""Zombie haz mat cleanup team"" is what my son called it. Held up VERY well for Halloween!!"
2,It is Visual and Quick But...,"I also found this book of limited usefulness. This is not an introduction to Vista but a tip sheet for those familiar with the program. The format and the graphics are too small for these old eyes.Some of the tips, especially the ones for the internet are also applicable to Windows XP.The view is not expansive here. It's a limited vista."
1,Micro Soft Visual for Vista,"The book is too small, and the visuals have to be looked at thru a magnifying glass. I did not find this book helpful at all."
2,Plikity-Plink,"I didn't enjoy this. If you require nostalgic piano roll music as background for film or a carousel or a nostalgic retail business it'll do, but the arrangements on each tune are mostly similar and mostly cheesy."
5,My daily bag.,"This bag is really good for daily use from your house - work trip. Never use it for walking trips, your shoulder will tell you that."
1,very cheap materials,"two major problems:1. after less than 6 months, one of the clips you use to fasten the front flap pulled right out of the fabric, and this bag was not put thru heavy use2. the shoulder strap is junk. if you put even a few books in the bag, it's enough weight to consistent pull the strap to its greatest length, because the adjustable apparatus is so cheaply made it won't hold. therefore, the bag is always down around your knees. looks pretty stupid, and very cumbersom.it looks nice when you get it, has nice pockets, etc, but the two problems i describe above render it uselss. do not buy this product."
2,"Looks cool, but not made well",The biggest issue I have with this bag is the strap. It CONSTANTLY kinks and twists. Especially where it's connected to the bag. The metal holder twists and gets all kinked. I've had this bag for 1 month now and I hate it.
5,yup,"great film. same as shaolin AND wutang, just a different box. it arrived on time and without any issues. a must have for collectors"
1,"'Out of the Shelter' by David Lodge, shipped by New Chapter Recycling","""I am most disappointed with this copy. I had paid $10.48 for a new paperbook and got a recycled book that had been dedicated to the original buyer in handwriting on the inside cover. This is meant for a gift so it is not only unacceptable but also most inconvenient. Time is limited until Christmas and I particularly wanted this book."" I have put one star for the suppliers not the book! The book is a lovely little account of the war years from a child's perspective. This item was shipped from New Chapter Recycling."
1,Typical Hood Bashing,"Author James McDonough's most recent work on the Battle of Nashville is yet another version of the tried and true formula of successful Tennessee Campaign authorship: ignore ethical historiography, and attack the character and ability of Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood. The typical rumor mongering, fact filtering, and censorship is apparent to any knowledgeable and dispassionate reader.For a fair and complete presentation of the important Battle of Nashville, read Thomas Hay's ""Hood's Tennessee Campaign"" or Winston Groom's ""Shrouds of Glory."""
2,Does Not Come Clean,"I loved my thermos but it can't be cleaned thoroughly. There's a plastic ring at the top of the tumbler which doesn't come off, but also isn't water tight. Coffee/gunk gets trapped underneath and there is no way to remove it. You can remove some of the gunk by taking a sponge/towel and running it along the ring, but it doesn't get it all. It developed a funky odor and then made my coffee taste bad.I wish I had read the reviews on the stainless-steel version as there have been multiple complaints about the same issue."
5,Best coffee cup ever.,This cup will keep hot drinks extremely hot for 3+ hrs. You will never want/need any another cup.
3,Disappointed,"I thought sure that being a Thermos product this would keep coffee warm for longer than a normal insulated tumbler. Even though I put hot water in it first it still was not hot after an hour. It was warm but for those that like hot coffee - not so good. It was not worth the cost - I wish I had taken the time to send it back. As someone else said, it may be because the top is just a plastic top."
3,Cheap Color Coating,"The cup is okay. Leaks from the top, but that's expected of most of the cups since they have to vent the steam somehow. However, once you scratch the coating, you will realize its a film that is placed on top of the stainless steel and it starts to peel and come off in the palm of your hands when you hold it too long. I'd give it a 4 for the stainless-steel with no color finish and a 2 for the crummy colored film."
2,Disappointed,"Next time, I will be listening to the reviews more. It was not as I expected, it didn't keep drinks hot for long. It was warm after an hour or two."
3,Keeps coffee warm,"Do not like the top cap for drinking, the top is very deep and hits the bridge of your nose when drinking. But other wise very well made."
4,Hot things hot & cold things cold,Keeps the temprature of contents much better than any two walled tumbler.Great for communting or extended travels.Should come in additional colors.
2,Read the many reviews on the web before buying this computer,"The motherboard went bad in less than two weeks after purchasing. It seemed like this computer had many nice features, but if it is broken you don't get much use from it. In finding many reviews on the web, it is clear that my problem is rather common. It also runs very hot and the battery life is less than 2 hours. Fortunately I have another computer than I can use and only need this one for occasional use....and that appears to be all that I will be able to count on using it.I would look for another brand of computer if I could do buy it again."
1,Zero good pages from mine,"My very first one of these seems to be a dud.It feels heavy enough to be full; but it is printing as if almost empty,and ``rocking'' it does not help. I'm not sure I can even find theoriginal carton to return it in."
3,Sabs,"This movie introduces Sabrina Spellman,the teenage witch.You will see her turn 16 and discover she is a witch.However,many characters are played by different actors than in the tv series."
5,spellbounding!,"I saw this movie back in 1996 when I was first starting freshman year of high school. I remembered that the show started in September and the movie came out on Showtime in May. Later I learned that they had done the movie first and then the tv show. I really like this character. She's really funny and sarcastic. If you like the show, you will like the movie. There are some actor changes from tv show/movie. But it's all good. The movie is very adventurous and you would like to have Sabrina's powers too.!"
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT . . .","This movie was OK. The plot was pretty good, and a lot of other people must have liked it, since it was what inspired the TV series, but I didn't like all too much. I think that's probably because I've already seen, and am a big fan of, the TV series, and all the changes with the people and the voices get really annoying, especially since I love the people and voices on the show. Don't let this discourage you from seeing this movie, but I'm just saying that if you've seen the show, you'll notice some big (and disappointing) changes, so be warned. If you've never seen the series, than I would definitely recommend this movie, because you wouldn't notice the differences and be set off by them."
3,Not As Good As TV Series,This was An OK Movie And it went into more detail about her witch hertiage but besides Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina. I Think The TV Series Cast was a Lot More Believable
5,Its a good video like the show,I think i seen it one time and thats when I started to like Sabrina now i watch and record it every week on abc channel 3 and 7 on friday nights at 9:00 its a good show about teenagers if you watch it you will like it
3,It was okay.,"I liked the storyline and the comedy was great, but it was very confusing after you've seen the show. I do recommend that everyone see it because it is very entertaining."
5,SO MUCH FUN!! HALARIOUS as they've said,"This book is Halariuous. Has many photos demonstrating how to dress, make gestures, and other behaviors that Italians are stereotyped for. Makes a great gift for that person who loves Italian culture but wasn't born an Italian. Highly recommend!"
3,Book- How to be an Italian,The book was what we were looking for but the condition was not very good. Pages started falling out the first time we opened it.
1,What A Bonehead,"This book is a total joke written by some old has-been. The techniques are laughable and you will come off like some loser. The author is over 60 but hasn't yet learn that young women who date much older men are primarily interested in money..oops, I mean financial security. Wake up, fool..."
1,A Total Pig....Oink!,"This guy gives all men a bad name. What is he going to do when his current girlfriend turns 30, dump her for a 21 year old? So he's going to end up 65 and chasing after young girls?He obviously has no ability to commit to one woman for life, because after five or ten years she would be too old for him.He reduces love to a game of outwitting and manipulating the opponent.There are women over 25 who are attractive as well as have something to say. This guy is a total jerk."
5,This Book Has All The Right Stuff to Get Young Women!,"Every Man must read Don's book, if he's interested in dating foxy young women. The book gives the man all the Right information he needs to attract and date women of all ages.I am 47. I am not rich. The book has helped me to date 28 year old attractive women easily. I know where to find them and not stand out like a dirty old man. This Friday, I am taking out a 10+ Babe, Colombian decent, 19 year old young woman.Thanks Don for giving me all the ""Right STUFF""."
3,Explains how young women think,"""How To Date Young Women"" stand outs among dating advice books for men. Steele explains what's going on in the heads of young women. He has a masters degree in counseling psychology, although he doesn't write like those ""sensitive New Age"" psychologists. It's clear that's he's writing from real-world experience. This is a practical book that will improve your relationships with younger women.I'm giving the book only three stars because the book lacks ""depth."" Almost everything in the book is right, but I wanted to know ""why"" young women do what they do, not what they do or what I should do. Specifically, I wanted to know why young women behave one way while saying they're doing the opposite.--Thomas David Kehoe, author of ""Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships"""
5,Insight into the female mind,"Understanding what motivates people is the most valuable information you can use for a successful relationship. Sadly, this book's unfortunate title will turn off many men and women before they can reap the benefits of the knowledge imparted. Men, especially batchelors, should carefully read this for one huge reason -- It tells you exactly what women want and why. If the author reworked and retitled this as ""How Women Think"" it could be a best seller."
1,This was a waste!,"This book isnt what i thought it would be.This book is really outdated and alot of his recommendations arent applicable today, dating just doesnt happen as it did in 1987. I mean we have the internet and clubs have changed and starbucks etc.This guy doesnt understand women well either. I bet he only got these women cause he is a doctor!Overall, i learned nothing except to bleach your tobacco stained teeth or get a hair transplant if your bald or get introduced to the girl through a friend.I was like ""yeah duhh""...STUPID AND WASTE OF MONEY!"
4,It really IS good advice,"I realize that the tone--and even the title--of this book will be offensive to some but here, at last, is a book whose premise is (among other things) that what women say they are looking for is rarely, if ever, what they respond to. Nearly everything in this book applies to women of all ages and while it is brash this is a book about how things are...not how we would like them to be."
1,A review from a young woman: this is BS,"Guys, wake up! This book is on the same caliber with Cosmo articles that tell women that they can get any guy they want with a few ""easy"" tricks. Repeat after me: If you want beautiful young women, you need POWER and MONEY. I've met a zillion guys in bars who try this body language bs, and it doesn't work. However, a CEO always get my attention. Draw your own conclusions."
5,"Blunt Advice, no bs","After practicing the advice in this book, my life has changed. Before I first bought it three years ago, my dating ""strategy"" was to go to bars with a buddy of mine and try to pick up chicks. After many failures and some humiliation, I realized I needed another way. I went online and searched for dating books and found this one. I also found the author's dating radio show on live 365.It took a while - I procrastinated somewhat, and when I started applying the advice, it worked. The biggest thing the book taught me was that women want a confident, powerful man. It is realistic as well - there is no magic formula to do or say to become successful with women - it requires hard work. It takes time. And it does work. I am 27, I live with my girlfriend, and I have a really good relationship with her. I owe a lot to this book. I have succeeded because I have become more successful and confident, not because of tricks, deception, or clever lines."
1,Misses the point,"If you want a young woman, you need money. Don't let this fool tell you that you can use body language to get a younger woman. The young women date older men for CASH. Why else would an attractive young woman not date young attractive man? What makes an older man think he is somehow superior to women his own age? Want some sound advice? Get some dough, not this book, and the young babes will be yours."
4,Great Book 4 all. 1 Reservation,"Even if you're not interested in dating younger women, you'll get something out of this book.It sheds light on what all of us, younger /older, Male / Female want out of life at different stages.Almost everyone, men of all ages and women under 35 can learn something about themselves and each other. If you're a 38 year old divorced woman, you might want to skip this book if you have thin skin.The author has a caustic, politically incorrect wit that spares no one, even the targeted reader. I laughed out loud.Plenty of very realistic advice on dating the percentage of younger women, that will enjoy older men.Preaches decent ethics too. Nobody needs to get hurt.The only reservation is the book is from late 1980's. Revised or not, It's a tad out of date."
5,Recommended,"If you are willing to change your life this book is for you. R. Don Steele has a very direct view on things. He tells it as it is. The media, society or our parents have built these illusions for us and hammered them into our brains year after year. And we function. But are we happy? Are we self actualized?Dating is one aspect of our lifes. After reading this book you might find yourself reevaluating other values as well. Warning to (wanna be) ""womanizers"": This book is about finding meaningful, romantic relationships although they might not last forever but it is not about getting laid as often as possible."
2,didnt tell me anything i didnt already know,"well guys, i dont mean to rain on your parade but...i grew up dating older women and will forever remain loyal to them. you know the types...short built blonde, conservative in dress,35-45 in age,looks just as good in a skirt as she does in jeans and a sweater...got to love those sweaters!! anyways..i am presently 38 years of age and have dated the younger 25-30 year olds but they come off as being self centered, greedy,lil valley girl types to talk to. I value a woman with real goals in life that can carry a decent conversation without over doing it with clishays <-(i know thats the wrong spelling but it doesnt matter to me!)or vulgar vocabulary.I will stay true to a fine older woman mainly because that is what i like for preference. i welcome any direct email personal responses from the women. what do you think of my comments, views etc.thanks"
5,Best dating book on the market,"The author Don Steele shows how to date young woman based on his own experiences - and not based on speculation as most of the hustler books on the subject. His advice has worked for me and it will work for you if you take the time to learn the skills presented in this book and take the necessary action to learn from your mistakes. This is not a miracle cure, but if you got the tenacity to learn the skills presented and you really want to change, then this book is the best on the market today. In a year you will be a different man, if you take action based on the advice presented in this book. Best regards, Granttra."
5,Review of How to Date Young Women by R. Don Steele,"R. Don Steeles book, How to Date Young Women, is an essential reference for men who want to actually date younger women, not only fantisize about it. Don's step-by-step approach is delivered clearly and real-world examples are used throughout. After an ended 7 year relationship, I found that I was quite rusty at dating. Now, I am comfortably dating again due to my improved appearance, attitude, and knowledge of what women are looking for.I've read and re-read this book and only wish I could have done so 10 or even 20 years ago!I highly recommend this book to any man at any age who is looking for ways to drastically turn his dating record around."
5,"""How to Date YW"" not for Wimps or ""Sensitive"" losers","R Don's books have been very helpful to me in regaining Male Pride and self-respect. His books are not slick and polished nonsense like the other books by ""Sensitive"" Males. He is blunt, to the point and best of all, not ""Politically Correct"". Many of his detractors seem not to have even tried to put into action his techniques, and thoughtlessly trash his books. R Don does not walk you down the primrose path; he tells Men what they need to hear not what they want to hear. Far from being a ""Neanderthal"", he is a wise teacher who brooks no falsehood. His insights into Women and Men are dead on. His techniques do not promise the Moon, but will get you independent Women and much happiness, sanity with a bit of hard self-examination and sweat. His detractors seem to be some Women who hate the way he sees through their Games or celibate, passive Men who are stuck on being a ""professional"" friend to Women."
4,Excellent Insight and Information,This book provides some excellent albeit dated advise on dating younger women and on getting a sagging lifestyle back into fighting trim. A good read.
3,Only for divorce men in their forties,"I give only 3 stars because of the style. It is wild, cold and without any romance. However, if you do not take it too seriously it is very funny. As the author explained at the beginning of the book, if you are seriously looking for you soul mate, do not read it. That is really a good advice but I read anyway and I am aware of many tricks."
5,"Very Good insight, changed my thinking","If you are interested in the topics covered (see the book's table of contents), you wont be dissapointed. I doubt that i will ever run at the speed of Don Steele, nor am i looking to do that, however, after reading this book it definitely has trained me to see, act, and enhance my capability to date a better quality girl(s) or young woman than what i could have before."
5,ABSOLUTELY DO NOT READ THIS!!!!!!,"If you read this book, you will be in competition with me, and I will not like it. Please stay where you are; thinking you will get women of all ages dressed like a dork, approaching anyone at any time, and using lines from Weber.I URGE YOU NOT TO READ THIS BOOK.This book has the secrets to success, and I do not want you to have those secrets, because I might lose the five women I am dating and mating with to you.Yes, I said five. At the same time. And yes, they all know that I am dating the other four. And all because of this book.So, please, DO NOT READ THIS. I DON'T NEED COMPETITION. Keep approaching 21yos with your ""patterns"", and I will score with them all the more easily. Thank you."
5,Blast Off!,"After getting divorced six months ago my life fell into a real rut. A lonely rut. A close friend of mine who is also divorced recommended this book and another, the Evolution of a Warrior (by Regan). My friend is 44 years old, has a live in girlfriend 14 years his junior, and regularly goes out on ""side dates"" with other women. Since he seems to have bounced back smartly from his divorce, I took his advice and read both books.Wow! I feel like someone lit a rocket under me to blast me out of my rut! Steele's book really opened my eyes to the point I felt I was naive about woman before I read it. The Evolution of a Warrior explored other facets of seduction as well as talking about how to take life by the horns and getting what you want. If you're stuck in a rut and feeling unhappy with your situation I highly recommend these books."
2,Reviews Look Fishy,"I have not read this book, but I read a lot of the reviews here on Amazon, and it is pretty clear that many of the reviews are written by the same person. (Guess which ones? The ones with five stars!) Someone seems to be spamming Amazon with positive reviews.I would further guess that if you read the book you'd notice some similarity between the author's style and the style of these reviews. Just a theory of course..."
1,"Poor book, but the spam is even worse!","The book is mediocre at best. Wasn't even worth finishing.In my defense, I bought it during a nasty divorce. Call it a moment of stupidity on my part.When I got it, the orders were probably being filled by the author himself since it is self published.I say that because that is the only reason that explains how I ended up on his email list.Unfortunately, I have never been able to get off of it. It has been over 8 years now if I remember correctly.Requesting removal doesn't work. Only seems to prod him on to send more.Blocking him doesn't work because every few months, he changes email addresses and/or servers.If you want to get spammed to death by this clown for years to come, having him tell you how smart he is and has it all figured out, go ahead and get it. You have been warned."
4,crude but true,"The first time I read this book the information provided was provocative and I couldn't put the book down until I had read it cover to cover. At first you question your own sanity for following advice this ""different"". But after you re-read the book a few times you start seeing the mirror images of your own life in the scenarios that are provided and you soon realize that the author has indeed ""been there and done that"". Now my only regret is that I didn't know about this book 10 years ago when I first became single again."
5,NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT!,"Completely unlike any other book on the subject. Brash, funny, and above all, HONEST. If you are a divorced or single man over 35 who is dissatisfied with the quantity or quality of your dates, THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE."
5,Not Just for Older Men,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. If you are reading these reviews, you are probably in the same boat as I am;unhappy love life. Don Steele has a plan; it is simple but not easy - which means this isn't a quick fix book for getting laid. If that is what you want, hire a hooker. Steele goes through it all in this book; where to find, how to meet, how to talk, and how to date young (or old) women. If you need help on these topics, you can find some inside."
2,"Interesting, but poorly written","I got this book primarily out of curiosity and perhaps the feeling that to be like R. Don Steele would make me a real man. As I read through the book, I found a lot of what he was saying to be insightful at times, but pretty naive at other times. The biggest concern I had was with the way it was written. I mean, a high school kid's term paper would read so much better. The chapters actually seem to be out of order: ch. 13 is ""Court Her"", immediately followed by ""Find Her"", ""Meet Her"", ""Talk with Her"", and then ""Date Her"". Wouldn't courting come AFTER you meet her? And the writing sounds like it is all rough draft with no editing for readability. Sometimes I thought that after a conquest, while still fairly drunk, he might sit down at the typewriter and punch in his current feelings. So it ends up being an almost unreadable mish-mash at times."
3,"Get real, guys","What does it really take for an older man to date *really attractive* younger women? Money and power. Sorry guys, just getting in shape and talking to women a certain way doesn't do it. If you really want babes, go start a company and make some money."
3,"Not Bad, but no wonder book.","This book is pretty good. It basically outlines what we all know anyway, ie ""get in shape"" ""dress nice"". It does give a sort of plan for 1st meeting on up, but real life seems to take more turns than this book plans for."
1,Pathetic....,"One, if you have to buy a book such as this, you have some issues. And two, if your desire to date someone that much younger can't be done without a book, you're likely wasting your money. It's pretty sad that men's priorities aren't leaning towards who or what the person is. As long as age is your number one concern, you better be getting more self-help books than this. As for women that would actually date someone who would buy this book, you're more likely to find them online OR you better have a lot of money. Get your pathetic priorities straight. From one younger gal who had to laugh when she read this title!"
5,The ONLY book that works,"If you want to know what it is REALLY about then buy this book TODAY. Contrary to the title, this book is NOT just for men over 35. I bought this book as a confused 23 year old and I haven't looked back since. The book explains where you are going wrong and will enlighten you on how to be successful with the opposite sex telling you bluntly: who she is, what she is about and how she sees the world from her perspective. This alone is worth the price of the book. However, it doesn't stop there! It tells you how to find, meet, talk and date with them and then goes into how she's feeling when it's time to have sex.It doesn't promote women as 'sex objects' nor does it radiate 'dirty old man'. With this book you'll finally be able to understand and enjoy women, and also, they'll be able to enjoy you.Bravo Mr R. Don Steele in telling it how it REALLY is."
2,Used office work stations,Excellent condition used office furniture for starter businesses or for those whom does not want to spent much.Excellent Customer services provided.
4,interior design by numbers,A good basic text on interior design and planning. Takes you on a step by step journey from concept to compleation.
5,I loved it!!,"This was an excellent book! I stayed up till 2:30 in the morning finishing it. Ethan and Patch were so perfect for each other, and I thought the plot was wonderful!"
3,pretty good beats and fun dirty lyrics but....,"peaches is a 2nd rate version of nikki darling of the lords of acid, her voice is kind of weak and while i realize that she writes lyrics for the shock value, she lacks substance behind them, i just think that she could have kept all of the shock but added a little more substance, i gotta give her props on the simple but good beats though"
1,Mundane Electronica and Dirty Words,"I have no idea how anyone could give this 5 stars. Perhaps pubescent boys who were tittliated by the sexual lyrics would be entrhalled by this.The music is totally pedestrian eletronica. Quite boring in fact. The lyrics aren't particulary clever or witty, just dirty."
3,Rappin' and slappin' it...,"This gal definitely puts the raw language in there. I'm not offended by that, per se, but amongst the fun rapping and singing with the electro-rockin' beats is an air of desperation: ""Ooh look at me I'm so naughty and bold!"" It can be done so the results are truly sexy - just check out Donna Summer's ""Bad Girls"" or Janet Jackson's ""Control"" - but what's missing here is subtlety of any kind; it's all ""in yo' face action."" That being said, if anyone likes their beats fat, and their talk dirty, will have fun with this. The track with Iggy Pop is my favorite - they sound like they're actually having fun, name-checking some of their past works and reputations along the way."
1,Unqualified Interpretations,"The author it seems bears a grudge against the largest lay organization that propagates Nichiren Buddhism worldwide, and attempts to form her own unique sect."
5,If you like uplifting euro pop dance music look no furthur,"I love this women!!! A friend shared a cd with me back in 2002 and I heard the track Dove, i was instantly hooked but did not know the artist name until recently. I have found many tracks Moony has performed on and a lot of remixes generated from Lifestories. All excellent, She is my new favorite Pop Singer. I hope she will come out with a new release since this one dates back to 2002. I would think she should be ready for another release, someone please let me know if there is talks about a release date since I can not read her web site, it is all in Italian."
5,You must buy this cd if you can!!!!,"I searched for this cd for 2 years, and finally found it. if you are lucky enough to get a copy acrobats and butterfly are 2 tracks that i found to be instant favorites to anyone."
3,Good Historical Outline/Poor Reprint,"I was looking for a concise chronological American History text to give my homeschooled children a broad overview of American History from a pre-revisionist perspective. This little volume was just what I needed and the three stars are for the book's content. However, this reprint leaves much to be desired. Although printed on 6x9 stock, the text block on each page only measures half that and the print is probably 8 point, making it very difficult to read. I see no reason why they could not have made the print larger and used the same number of pages.Post Script: As it turns out, the version we received from Amazon was published by Kessinger Publishing, whereas the version depicted on Amazon is a Michigan State University reprint which has a much better layout. Caveat Emptor!"
4,a must-see for nature lovers,"A newly married couple sets out alone on skiis to follow the Porcupine caribou herd on its annual migration across Canada to birthing grounds in northern Alaska. As they travel, they try to survive and keep up with the herd, all while taking a movie of the trip. Sounds like fiction, but it's not. The fact that one of them is a movie maker helped. But even so...what an adventure. The movie is intentionally informal, almost like a home movie. Anyone hoping for a car chase or conflagration of skyscrapers amid shooting bullets will be disappointed. This is the caribou's movie, the Arctic's movie, the mountains' movie, and a testament to the fact that at least two among us have guts and imagination."
4,"If you like Yanni, you'll love this one!","Thunder Bay is an excellent album by relative unknown Kurt Kunzat. A native of Michigan who spent many summers in the upper portion of the state, it is obvious that Kurt drew on the beauty of the suroundings in composing this music. One can almost see the water of the Great Lakes when listening to any one of the tracks. We can only hope that Kurt continues to compose and produce music of this quality."
3,"Really good. No, honestly.","Great changeup from a lot of worship stuff out there. Maybe it's not really worship, and that's ok. Its lyrics come straight out of scripture and it makes for a very energetic mix. u2's 40 is covered and sounds deeply layered and well thought out. Altogether a nice change of pace from anything else on the Christian music market."
5,Lacoste Inspiration for Women is my favorite fragrance,"The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition just as if I had purchased it at a Major department store, but at half the price! Great Service!"
5,Very good Product,"This perfume, smells really nice, is a soft smell. is a good quantity. the design of the bottle is good. this product i definitely will buy it again."
5,The best.,I have the experienec of many perfumes. This is the one lasting very long. Even 12 hours after the application it is still there. The smell is very elegant.The other perfume will dissipdate after 15 minutes. This is the only one I knew lasting very long.
3,packs on,"very good service I received the book within 5 days of ordering it very informative book. This book was about my fathers army war days in Italy and the training in colorado, so many of the stories in the book I had heard form my father. Good history!"
4,Great Piano Training Method,"I bought this book for ""nostalgia:"" I just picked up a keyboard and wanted to play the songs I grew up on in my Suzuki piano lessons. It's funny how the memories come flooding back - how I got terribly sick of that monstrous 8 page Sonata in the middle, but loved the last song ""Gigue,"" etc. And now that I don't have to practice for a teacher, I have great fun just relearning the ones that I truly enjoyed.Most people aren't going to buy this book out of the blue without a history of Suzuki piano, but if you do, be forwarned that it's reasonably advanced, not beginner level: I don't think I reached it until about 6 years into my piano career.But the music is printed in good, legible text, and there are lots of fingering hints which are a rare find in ""grown up"" piano music."
1,What?!?!,Horrifyingly bad...The plot seems to revolve around the story of disjointed characters that go nowhere and do nothing save getting in deep trouble every 30 seconds whereupon they escape to go about getting into trouble. Plus...how does freezing someone send them into a past that never existed? Yeah...really...bad...
2,See the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version,"Actually this film aint too bad I must say compared to other movies shown on the show. The Ape costumes and effecs are really watchable, but the story has no merit.However if your a fan of the Planet of the Apes movies then this will be for you.A family trying to get cryongenically frozen gets sent back in time in the future when it was ruled by apes. Like I said the makeup ape stuff is good, I was scared when I watched it, its definitely in some cases better than that Tim Burton garbage remake but its not a classic.The family escapes the apes and makes friends with some of the simians out there before making plans to go back into time. Not bad , Joel Hodgson , though and the robots do have their waywith this one."
4,Good job by former unknown,"This was a good cd for a newcomer. Released and sold by the artist prior to his time on Nashville Star, this is a must have for any fan of the show and the winner Chris Young!"
2,Disappointed with the usability & quality,I was expecting a much better stove considering its price. The hose has propane leak near the connector connecting to the stove. Why couldn't they use a more reliable connector? The locking clip on one side wouldn't hold the lid. Had to bend it make it tight.Cons:1. The knobs are tiny in a very tiny space where even my small hinds find difficult to operate.2. Every time I have to check whether clockwise is increasing the flame or is it other way around. Very difficult to see.3. The hose connection is in the front whereas you would generally keep the propane tank behind. Hence you have to take hose from behind and below and then attach it in the front.Weird: The handle is at the back. Very non-intuitive.Pros: Shiny cover. Strong flame.
2,"Bummer, nothin but probems...","The thing works great when it works. Unit surges all the time and regulator freezes more than half the time. Didn't think I would mind the hose being in the front, but it sucks. Its also heavy and bulky- thought I wouldn't mind that either, it's simply, problematic."
1,Unusable zippers,I returned this trunk because the zippers (all zippers) were so stiff they either could not be used or took a lot of time effort to unzip.
1,Hmmmmmmm,"Well, OK but not that good. Yawn!!!!!Mind you I had read thi years back when Daewoo still ""EXISTED"""
5,"Great tea, great service",I received a sample of this particular tea someplace and just had to order some. I found it on Amazon and the price was right. The tea arrived very quickly and I've already been enjoying it for a few days. It was a pleasure doing business.
4,For the very keen wildlife watcher,"I suspect the book is a little over my head, but it's very thorough & well-reasearched. For a layman like myself, I think I'd like photos - or colour pictures of the animals too - but as the author says, the book goes beyond the normal ""field guides"" which aim to help with animal identification.If you want to know things like how the lives of a dikdik & a duiker differ (but you could tell them apart), this is the book for you!"
3,Good story with a bizarre conclusion...,"I enjoyed this story. It's well paced and well thought out--until the very end. I was reading it on a plane, and I got to the bottom of a page, turned for the next, and hit the back cover! I looked to make sure I hadn't lost a few pages. Nope. That was the end, all right. And it left me totally unsatisfied. It was as if Parke decided that it was time to punch the clock and go home..."
1,"I thought this was a pair, not just one dumbbell",I ordered a set of 5lb dumbbells. I received my shipment yesterday and to my surprise there was only 1 dumbbell. I will most definately be returning this.
1,Disappointed/Website description wrong,"I had a bad feeling when I placed the order, but was convinced to go ahead by the positive reviews. However, I had the same experience as some of the negative reviews. The title/product description clearly says, ""Neoprene Dumbbells Black (Sold in Pairs)."" I received one purple dumbbell. Really disappointed and hope it doesn't happen to many others."
3,5 lb Neoprene Dumbbell,"The description and the way the product is advertised made it seem as if you were getting a set of 2 dumbbells. Really you only get one. Other than that, it's pretty much what I expected a weight to look and feel like."
2,"OK, except for the smell","When the dumbbells arrived, I opened the package to find a bad chemical smell from the neoprene. I used the dumbbells for a few minutes, and then my hands had the bad smell. Now that I've had the dumbbells for a few weeks, the smell seems to have mostly gone away.The size and shape of the dumbbells are fine, and the neoprene has a nice feel to it. The hexagon shape keeps them from rolling away."
5,"Good Service, Good Product","We are Happy with our purchase of the dumbells, it is exactly what my son wanted and the service was very fast."
1,Not so much,"I would love to review the actual product, but I can't. In place of two sets of dumb bells (one 3 lb., one 5 lb.), I received an EMPTY box. Upon my inquiry as to what had happened, I was advised by Perform Better that the shipping company must have had the box opened and the weights must have fallen out - causing them to re-tape it and send it on its way. Yes, I'm sure that they would do that, rather than return what would have remained back to the company of origin.I was then advised that the 3 lb. set could be resent right away, but the 5 lb. set would take longer; I agreed, asking that they be sent ""two-day"". I was offered a refund for the entire order instead - which was promptly processed.Waiting now for weights from another company..."
5,Just what I ordered,"I received 2 black, neoprene-coated, 7-pound dumbbells, exactly what I ordered. I checked with Perform Better before I ordered to be sure I would receive 2. Their reply was prompt and courteous and the product arrived promptly."
3,Good Tape,This is a very good tape and I would definitely recommend it to any Sam Shepard fan or anyone in search of some good music.
1,bad expiration date,"I purchased it on Amazon in Dec 2012. But the expiration date of the test strips I received was 2013-11, which was less than one year. I bought it to check my blood sugar weekly. That means some of the strips will definately expire due to the short expiration date. I was so disappointed at this order."
5,Accurate testing,Tested blood sugar at a lab and used the test strips at the same time was within 5 of lab sugar level. Very good product.
5,Best Gospel Cd,"wow ruben u really out did yourself this time what an amazing cd, can't wait 4 '' The Return Of The Velvet Teddy Bear''."
3,Great gospel CD. Lousy choice for AI fans.,"If you love the sound of true Gospel, then run out and buy this CD now. To his credit, Ruben stays true to his roots with this vocally outstanding CD that shows the true range of this man's beautiful voice. That's the good news.Now the bad news. This CD is not for the secular American Idol fan. There is no indication on the CD itself that the entire CD is gospel. In fact, when I bought the CD, it wasn't even in the Gospel section; it was in the Pop section. It seems clear that most stores aren't even aware that it's a Gospel CD.Bottom line: great for Gospel fans, lousy for Pop fans."
1,Oh Where Did my Ruben Go!,"One more idol down the tubes, why Ruben when you had so much potential. I thought gospel was your calling but I was wrong. Please do songs from your idol years."
2,"Poor Ruben,","Well, I just want to get something of off my chest to tell everyone thinking about buying this album.Ruben is boring. His voice is great, but nothing fits him, as if he should go away. Ruben and this CD are not R&B;, or pop, or rock, or country, or rap, or AC. So, what is this album? I think Ruben made a new genre called ""borsoul"" because this album is a mix of gospel, R&B;, pop, and boring.I'm not going to blame Ruben, I'm blaming J Records for making this.Sorry Ruben. Maybe next time, if there is one, you'll create a good and fun album like Kelly Clarkson and soon Diana DeGarmo."
5,Alabama's Star child does it again!,"We are so proud of our Alabama star. I just love Ruben. I saw him in person here in Mobile and he is GREAT on stage. He is so humble. I'm a big gospel fan, I listen to gospel everyday all day. This album is right there at the top! I love it, especially ""Fix it Jesus"" and ""I Need an Angel"" Ruben has a beautiful, soulful voice and he just sweeps you up into the praise with him. It's a powerful album, one that he should be very proud of. You did your thing Ruben. I don't buy many CD's but this one was special and it's a keeper."
4,Velvet Teddy Bear is great!,This is a fantastic cd. Go out and pick it up! Don't you just want to squeeze those cheeks?
5,"Excellent, Ruben, excellent!","What a wonderful trip down memory lane with some of my gospel favourits like Going Up Yonder, Center of My Joy, Running Back to You, Restoration, etc. All done with a nice upgraded twist. There are some great duets with Fred Hammond and one half of Mary Mary. Ruben is in his element here, his voice sounds terrific, it really suits the material. The music is awesome, great production. Donnie McClurkin and all the others had better take two steps to the right to make room for ROOOO-BENNNNN!Good job, Ruben, good job!"
5,Voice like an angel,Finally Ruben you've found what your listening audience has been waiting for. A CD that uses your talents.
5,Delicious songs for gods,I Need an Angel Food Cake is a uplifiting poean to the kind of Gospel from the sixties like Melvin Gaye's What's Goin on my Sandwich and Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing about mayonnaise and Mercy Mercy Me (the turkey gravy)
3,Its okay!!!!!!!!,"This is not one of those cds that I would say you just have to go out there and buy its pretty good. I rated it as average because he is really talented but since this is a gospel joint I would have anticpated for it to be more annointed than just a regular artist coming up making a ""church"" album. I really like ""Center of My Joy"" as it is one of my favorites. The rest of the songs are sadly forgettable. I like Ruben but he just seems to be lost right now. I hope he can find his own identity and image."
5,Awesome!,"Congrats to Ruben. Just that easily, ""I need an Angel tops many Gospels fan's top spot for 2004. I love this song. He also does great renditions of the gospel cuts we all grew up singing and listening to!"
5,WHAT AN ALBUM!!! if only i could sing like this man.,"This album has to be in my top 5 albums in my cd collection. what a voice this man has got. He is a legend. I am a great fan of AI and was so glad ruben won it. I think he is the best AI winner so far.This album is great because it relly shows how great and powerful his voice is. Whereas his debut album ""SOULFUL""didnt as much as this one. Although it still deserves 4 stars.Every song on this album is brilliant, whuich all show you exactly why ruben won AI2. My favourites on the album are,""I NEED AN ANGEL"" and ""AMAZING GRACE"". These are two songs that make me go all tingly everytime i hear them. He has got this nice, smooth, soulful voice that is just one in a million. IF ONLY I COULD SING LIKE THIS MAN!!!If tou are looking for an album that will make you feel all happy and can really get into, this is a must for you.I absolutely love this album and love rubens voice, you definately have to buy this album. youll love it. 5 **** all the way."
5,"Ruben Hits the Mark with ""I Need an Angel""","Ruben Studdard has matured as an artist and this is highly evident on this lovely collection of gospel and inspirational songs. What is most remarkable about this CD is the vocal range that he displays on the various songs. It is inspiring and entertaining at the same time.I love the title track and predict that it will be a huge hit for him. The more I listen to this CD, the better I like it and the more inspired I become. This is smooth, soulful Ruben at his best. Try it, you'll like it.Thanks Ruben for giving us an insight into your spiritual side and bringing these great songs to the masses."
4,Ruben's Got An Angel Of An Album,"I loved Ruben from the very beginning of American Idol. He has a wonderful voice that is smooth and silky. Although I didn't buy is first album, I liked the songs that were played on radio. Since my first love is gospel, I decided to buy his new CD. I can honestly say I love every single song on this album. I love the contemporary feel he has given to the old standard gospel songs. Even though he kept it ""old school"" on Fix It Jesus, it still sounds new.I believe this album will draw people in who might not listen to gospel regularly. The good news is still being spread but with today's R&B; sound."
3,It serves to show how good theseguys were...,"It serves to show how good theseguys were. It is a solid debut, but not a memorable one. Anyway, it's clear since the beginning how Wolf Hoffmann was a genius on guitar."
1,Stay away,"These look like the bees knees, but they really are a pain to use. You get sick of sitting it on your sink, because it is always in the way and I am sure you dont have room in your cupboards for it, we certainly dont. We use it for washing out our fruit and store it on the top of the cupboard, but really, I would recommend another kitchen knack for your toll chest."
5,The Best!,"This deer repellent is the best. I have tried all the others with little success. I bought this at a local retailer, and the deer stopped and I haven't had any damage."
1,"Not enough details, outdated, very poor learnig tool.","The book showed different gauges but did not fully explain how to read them or how they worked, and why they are needed. This would be a very poor learning tool because it showed alot of things but did not fully explain anything. I could not recommend this book to anyone who did not already have a working knowledge of avionics."
1,Disappoiting,Book might be adiquate for undergraduate level general engineering class. This book lacked detail and contained technical errors. Some of the information was outdated.
3,Good singles,"Great band name! This album has the original line up of girls. Siobhan later did a Geri Halliwell and abruptly left the band. The Sugababes got in a new girl and have released two other albums, ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", and ""Three"".""One Touch"" has cool little choons that sound different from the pop music out now. Not as over the top as The Spice Girls (the best pop group of the 90's), not as schmaltzy as the boyband sound. The girls sound alot older than their 16 years. But their still only under 20 and it can be kinda funny listening to them trying to be all artistic and soul divaish with their vocals. But great singles. Pick this up. The Canadian domestic release has the same cover only black."
2,so much for new popopstars,i hope those sugababes read this. no offense but u guys suck...ur music sux....it has tom much of a tchno-preppy remix...get with the century....it's call the HIP HOP ERA!!!!...u dont use techno remixes unless u really wanna screw up ur own careers...and i sing a whole lot better....they wud do alot betta if they split up for like a couple of minutes during a song...like one sings and the other backups..jeez...and i mean all this i am saying...and ur lucky i am evn giving u a 2 star...and ur betta than britney at least...nikZ
5,Sugalicious,"All I can say about this cd is WOW. A friend kinda told me about them and now I am so hooked on them. Once you listen to them you will never be the same. Believe me. Amazing cd, for such young girls. Strong voices and parts and sweet innocence at other parts. Melodic yet intriguing. I defenitly recommend this cd to anyone who likes great garage music."
4,BLESSING,"THIS BOOK WAS A BLESSING. TODAY I'M AT A CROSS ROAD IN MY LIFE. ONCE I HEARD ABOUT VINCENT BOOK READ IT, MY MIND BECAME FREE AND I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S MY PURPOSE. THANK YOU GOD FOR THIS PERSON AND FOR GIVING HIM THE BLESSING OF WORDS."
4,The Author Bare's His Soul...,"A Journey of Transformation--Poems is the first (and certainly not the last) book of poetry from this up and coming talented author. His words are conveyed with such spiritual and southern down-home tenaciousness...as evident in his soulful roots. My personal favorites are ""My Brother's Keeper"" and the gut wrenching ""What Happened to You Loving Me"". Vincent Spann has created a poetry reading that weaves together soliloquy and magic and the small bright delights of everyday life."
3,A worthwhile journey,"Vincent Spann's book gives readers the opportunity to look into his frame of mind and spirituality. By sharing his words, he shares a part of himself. It takes courage to know one's self; it takes even greater courage to allow the world into the privacy of your life. Bravo for sharing in the spirit!"
4,Bright new poet shares his journey,"An awsome expose' of soul-stirring poems. This refreshing young poet may one day ""soon"" join the arena of other great poets. His words have the spirit of an old soul searching for understanding. I enjoyed this journey. I also recommend this book of poems."
1,save your money,"Very poor acting,very slow moving film.Would not recomend this film.The only thing I can say good about this movie,is it had some good action scenes of bull riding."
2,Not That Hot A Ride For Me,"I basically kept waiting for some high quality footage of bull riding and I was still waiting when the movie ended. I can't really comment on its merits as a movie, as I wasn't really listening to the dialog."
5,"Good price, dencent sound,fair build quality.",Overall good value for the money. Install is pretty simple and straight forward. Not sure on longevety of the system but so far things work well. Am I faster? doubtful. Am I cooler? probably not. Did this cat-back make the truck sound more like a truck? yes. I did not weigh the stock exhaust but I will speculate that that switching out to this system dropped about ten pounds.
2,Nice descriptions but no color photos.,"The descriptions and price estimates were helpful. The complete lack of color photos, except for the cover, was an extreme disapointment. The photos ranged from average to poor quality and were of limited value in indentifying artifacts. I feel the book description should have clearly noted the lack of color photos."
5,Ancient China treasure chest,"This is a great product! The children were so excited when they opened the box! Real coins, real ink and brush, real fan, a mock castle to build, a game to play and serveal other exciting learning tools. This was a real treasur to use!"
4,C-Nasty,"Works well. Does not work well in the shower though. Also good for giving massages. Must use a generous amount for it to be effective. After a lot of friction it turns into a thick, white, clumpy residue. My girlfriend does not like the way it feels inside of her."
4,Helpful insights,"In ""The Corinthian Catastrophe,"" George E. Gardiner addresses some of the errors in the modern Charismatic/Pentecostal movement. Mr. Gardiner was himself a Pentecostal preacher who later left the movement.This book rightly confronts the emotionalism of the Charismatic movement and its lack of authority and discernment. For this part the book was valuable. Mr. Gardiner is correct in his rebuke of Charismatics who place more emphasis on the gifts than the fruit of the Spirit.This book would be a favorite of anyone who is already convinced of cessationism and hated by those who are guilty of the excess rebuked in this book (The TBN crowd).In the end the book provides very helpful insights into where the Charismatic movement needs correction."
1,Tedious way to learn Danish,"I moved to Denmark for work and wanted to learn the language. I'd heard good things about this method of language learning, but was really surprised at how bad it was. The tape always assumed that I was a male American, but I'm a female Scot! The phrases were drilled so much that I found my mind often wandering, and the accent of the speaker is quite different to what I hear in the region I live in. It also doesn't give you a feeling of having learnt what you need to be able to survive.The saving feature is the amount of Danish that you hear. It gets you more used to hearing Danish, and learning where the words start and end.I have swapped over to using ""Colloquial Danish"" and practicing with Danish friends."
4,3.5 stars actually,"This album is one of the better compilations I have heard. A lot of times with comp's you get a CD full of left over tracks that should never had been released. Not here. Mike Nardone has a radio show in LA called ""We Came From Beyond"" hence the title. He called in some personal favors and put together this CD. He has been responsible for breaking a lot of these acts on this disc. The production is solid throughout and if you look at the artists you know that lyrically it is gon be tight. The opening track with Esoteric, Celph Titled & Apathy is a good representation of what the Demigodz crew is all about. The J-Zone track is also tight. On the week side of the disc you have the highly disappointing Vast Aire cut ""Why is the sky blue?"" which is really bad and The Afro Joint (??) track is ok. Overall this comp rates higher than most. It is not terrible not classic just good solid hip-hop all the way through."
2,A not so great follow up to Vol. 1,"I bought this album anticipating it would be like vol.1 Its more mainstream sounding than underground. The best track is 9 with slug, eledea, and Aesop Rock. If you dont have any We Came From Beyond albums, get vol.1, you wont regret it."
5,Lasted for TWO summers!,"I bought this pool the spring of 2008 - it lasted that summer and the summer of 2009. I just pulled it out today for a random hot April day (2010) and it was still fine until I decided to try to move it with a bit of water in it and pulled on of the frog leg seams open... it lasted for the day with chewing gum and duct tape - but I am VERY pleased with how long it lasted!! My daughter is now 4 and we have a new baby, so I am opting for a larger pool. But this really was a great pool... if the larger pool stinks, I'll come back and buy this one again!I also bought the version that had a slide, which worked ok, but I understand why they discontinued it.ENJOY!"
3,Good enough,The pool is wide enough and the material is durable so far. Can't review it that much though because I bought it as a gift for somebody else.
3,Leaky Fun,"My 2 year-old loves the pool and the fountain is a great addition over a standard pool. However it definitely arrived with a slow leak, the exact location I have not identified. It can be filled in the morning and will be mostly empty by the next morning. I purchased the pool new, but not through Amazon."
2,Poor Quality,I received this pool and blew it up immediately. It took quite a bit of time and effort to blow it up manually. Once it was done it looked very cute and I thought it would be a great pool. Then with in four hours it was over 50% deflated. So we blew it up again and within four hours same thing. This time we did not blow it up but folded it up and sent it back. We were very dissapointed as I had spent a lot of time looking at many pools on the internet. So I would not recomment this pool or the manufacturer. I did buy another pool and I made sure it was a different manufacturer.
2,Forget the cutsey,"Cuter 'n a bug, but nowhere near as durable. Lasted about 6 weeks. We now have given up on using, storing and reusing cutsey pools. We just buy a bigger, plain-ole and cheaper one every summer, recycle it rather than waste time and space storing it for the next year. Spreading the cost over a summer of use (our summers are hot and long), that's pretty reasonable summer entertainment and relief costs. The kids, btw, dig the water, no matter what it's in. What they don't dig are leaks and blow-up attachments/gizmos that quickly hang limply over the edges and get in their way of play. It's me that was drawn to the fanciful."
2,SaveYourMoney,"this pool looks so much bigger online but when you get the little frog home that is exactly what it is little, i have 3 kids and they hardly fit my childrens weight the oldest 7 39lbs the middle child 6 36lbs and the younges 3 33lbs as you can see my children are not chunky at all actually very little and all three of them in this pool its a tight fit. I don't know why they think its cool to make the pool bigger in the pic and the kids smaller this is not how it looks at all if you want this go to Kohls i bought this with 30% off and i returned it the same days!!! save shipping and your time"
1,it was from poor quality and way to expencive,it looks bigger than it realy is on the pictureit is made to thin on the on the bottomwould not get it again afther i day 3 year old kids playing in it it whent in to the garbidge
4,NOTHING SCARES THEM--FOR LONG!,"Two inseparable friends pride themselves on their fearlessness as they banish monsters and pirates in imaginative play. When they discover the CREATURE feature on TV, one is delighted, but the other friend is so scared that she gets a stomach ache. However, she is even more scared that her friend will react negatively to her fears, so she suffers in silence--until she hears a scream. It is her friend, and she saves the day by rescuing him from a scary spider. He kindly returns the favor by turning off the TV when the dreaded CREATURE feature returns. They end up playing at being fearless again, having overcome their respective fears with their friend's help. Brightly illustrated, this book is appealing and shows children that different people have different fears, but they can be overcome or avoided."
5,Fantastic Mystery,"Sue Henry has done a superb job of bringing Alaska to those of us down here in the lower 48 States, with a mystery spin."
3,cold blooded killer running across Alaska,"I picked up this book with the hope of finding a new author for a mystery series I could enjoy. I was not very impressed with the character development, though, so I doubt I will stick with the series.That said, this book was entertaining in that it took me to places I have never been, and to an event I knew little about except for vaguely remembering it featured on ABC's Wide World of Sports many years ago. The drama of identifying the killer was a bit weaker than I thought it would be, and the motive for the killings was very weak. But it was a fun ride through the snow."
1,Can't believe this won awards,"Info about the race was interesting, but as a mystery, it was clunky and labored."
5,Amazon Rocks!,I love to be able to put my hands on just the books I want and not have to pay high prices. They arrive in fast order and I always want to know I have a Sue Henry book waiting for me as soon as I finish another.
5,Murder on the Iditarod Trail,I love this book ... I love the description of the musher experiences as they travel. Sue Henry's love affair with Alaska as told through Jessie Arnold is stunning. So are the rest of the books in her Jessie Arnold and Maxie and Stretch series.
2,Disappointed!,"I don't know why I assumed that this was a cookbook, but it isn't. I have seen a couple of her cookbooks and was really impresed with how it was written. But this particular book (while I am sure the information is smart and helpful) was just a bunch of tips for living a healthy lifestyle. ""Drink more water"" ""eat more fruits and vegetables"" blah blah blah! Nothing that my doctor hasn't told me a million times! I looked Ellie up by name because I have seen her on TV and think she makes healthy delicious food and I want to start eating right. I am trying to figure out if I am a moron for not recognizing that this was NOT a cookbook or maybe for thinking that Ellie only writes cookbooks, but in any event this book it not for me. Hopefully other people will read my review and find this out before they make a purchase. I will eventually get my hands on one of her cookbooks! Back to Amazon to resume my search..."
5,Love Ellie & the small changes recommended,"This is a delightful and inspiring book reinforcing what we all know we should be doing and breaking it down into easy & do-able steps. The recipes are delicious and easy to create!I would definitely recommend this book to you if you are looking for a smart and realistic way to start being healthier and doing it the ""right"" way."
4,GREAT INFORMATION,"I love Ellie , she is bright and informative. Her book is simple but full of ideas you may have not already thought of. I enjoyed the recipes too. Give it a try!"
4,Great suggestions,I love Ellies TV show on Food Network. This book has many of her best tips in one place plus the pacing allows you to take babysteps on the path to good health. I plan to send it to my Mom soon :)
2,routine advice,"Nothing new here. Just like every other ""self-help"" lifestyle book. Save your money, just buy the cookbook which is excellent."
2,small changes big results,Not too much new information in this book written by a RD. I am a certified Chef and perhaps I am already aware of all of the info but am always trying to educate myself-this boo did not offer me this.
3,Not so good small changes,"The idea of small changes over 12 weeks sounds great, but I believe I could have come up with much better changes to make than what the author suggests."
3,"Love Ellie, but not that useful of a book.","I love Ellie Krieger, her show, and her food. This book, which I bought because of the raving great reviews, was in my opinion a little bit of a waste of time, for me personally. Maybe if you are very out of shape, eat unhealthy, and have never exercised, you may enjoy this book and it will get you started on a weight loss/good health pathway. Maybe you are looking for a gentle plan to healthy eating and exercising and want to follow 12 steps to build you up to move 2 hours a week. Then this book might work for you - she is an excellent writer and well-spoken. But for those who already exercise, are trying to lose weight by having already changed your eating habits, and understand that avocados, nuts, and olive oil in moderation are better fat choices than chorizo and cupcakes, and whole grains are better than processed, then I don't think you'll find anything new here. For recipes, I would suggest her So Easy cookbook. Hope this review helps."
2,Slow and Sure,"The basic concept of this book was good. To make small changes in your lifestyle instead of trying to make an unattainable commitment. Too many people go ""gung ho"" when starting a diet and give up too many foods and try to exercise till they are sore and stiff then give up. This gives you ideas to start out slow and sure.I just expected a few more recipe ideas to alter the high calorie ones, etc. For someone that doesn't know about how to start out slow, this is a good book."
4,Simple steps,"For me, the appeal of this book lies in its simple, step by step approach. I have read lots of diet books and almost all of them have something to offer, but right now, I am overwhelmed. I don't know where to start and I feel that the program offered in this book may help me to get started - One-week-at-a-time. Maybe I will even be able to make the small changes permanent."
4,Realistic Approach to Healthy Lifestyle,"Ellie Krieger's approach to making healthy changes in eating and exercise are so doable. Results really feel big, while the changes are incremental."
5,Good Looking Receipes,"Although I haven't started the healthier eating plan yet, I do know some of the food she prepares on TV look might tastey."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Bottom line: its raspy. I chose the cheap alternative to a performance exhaust for my BMW and I somewhat regret it. The sound is deep, but the tone is not that great for an I-6 engine. I am probably going to bite the bullet and spend $800 on an RPI exhaust for my 530 instead. This Magnaflow has a lot of drone and the other bummer was the inlet size was 2 1/4"" compared to the 3"" pipe coming out of my engine. So, it resulted in an overall restriction which caused me to lose low-end torque.I'm getting rid of this thing, sadly.. =("
1,IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR MAF,"It damaged my Mass Air Flow sensor in such a way that the CRC MAF cleaner did nothing. I had to buy a new MAF. I also suspect it damaged my Throttle Position Sensor. The replacement of the MAF, throttle sensor and paper filter ended up costing more than $400.00."
5,Beats alone 5 stars,Why? why are people sleeping on J Zone ? He is one of hip hops most brilliant producers and is actually a great rapper (dude has some serious punchlines). Support real talent. buy his music.
5,A New Brand Perspective,"This book is pleasantly different from the other brand books out there, not only because of the method, but also because it logically articulates branding on and off the web-- and integrates it with other areas of marketing. Lots of times branding is a distant cousin to marketing and corporate communications, and this book makes it all fit together. As the creator of a small business, it's useful to me but I can also see how it will help big corporate executives as well. An enjoyable read, and very useful."
5,Perfect timing,"a great book about branding and marketing with substance! Most of the books I've read about the web, marketing, and web-marketing either use case studies (many of which are quickly obsolete) to make their case or branding theory. From Bricks to Clicks clearly is written with an understanding of both the value of hard-core branding (not just creating a logo, but building a brand by building a business) as well as what business is all about. I found it engaging and interesting. I especially liked the section on globalization ... I don't think I've seen that discussed adequately anywhere, and this is a great start with really good insight. The last 18 months showed what happens when companies forget/or don't know the basics of identifying and selling value - this book makes doing that right a lot more understandable."
3,A Picture Book,"The title is ""Breakthrough"". The content, however, is not. While the lesson is solid, it is nothing new. The book is filled with charts and graphs (over 100), they are hard to follow and often too small to read. The author is a consultant and the book apparently documents some of his tools for success. Reading the chapter summaries and the bibliography should be enough for a seasoned practitioner to grasp the content.Some of my perception may be due to the translation, apparently the book was originally written in Italian. The message is not bad. If a reader can stay awake long enough to read the whole book his or her attention span is longer than mine."
5,certainly worth getting!,"Wow. 3 excellent CDs for a wonderful price. This would be a great set for anyone wanting to hear some profoundly good barbershop. I've enjoyed listening to this set, and I wish I could sing half as good as these guys!"
1,Not what I was wanting at all,"I ordered this CD set wanting to get Barbershop quartet music. Unfortunately, that is not what I received. What I got was basically acapella jazz. Too much Manhattan Transfer, not enough real, boater hat, striped vest, toe tapping barbershop. Oh, a few of the selections were OK (at best), but most of them have very modern, jazzlike arrangements. I suppose this is the current state of ""barbershop quartet"" music. I am beginning to get the feeling that finding real, traditional Barbershop Quartet recordings is going to be difficult..."
3,Just ok,"Based on positive reviews from others, I expected it to be an excellent product. Was a bit disappointed to find out that it was really just ok. It doesn't flake, but it also doesn't hold your brows in place all that great. I still believe that Anastasia brow gel is the best product out there."
4,BROW-HOW,"For those with unruly eyebrows this mousse will hold every hair in place all day and well into the evening.Many of us have thick brows but don't really care for the super tweezed look so we put up with difficult to tame brows while hoping for a natural look. No more.Tweezerman's gel isn't sticky or gummy, invisible after applied, plus one tube lasts and lasts.At times, it really is the ""little things"" that make a difference."
3,Hairspray may work just as well.,I didn't notice a difference with this item from using hairspray applied to your fingertip and shaping with your fingertip. (You could also spray an eyebrow comb!)
1,the king's clothes,This product was empty.Not a sign of any mousse in it.When I tried to find out how to return it I discovered the postage charges were more than the cost of the item.Never again!!
4,I like it!,"I like Brow Mousse very much, but I have never used another product like this so have no point of comparison. It does keep your brows in place well and doesn't leave any clumps. I hoped it would train some of my wilder eyebrows that have appeared with age, but no such luck. However, it does keep them in place very well when I use it."
2,didn't work,"eyebrow hair didn't really stay in places when applied. I couldn't notice a signficant different before and after application.For $9, I was hoping for more than making my eyebrow hair feeling wet."
1,Not very good!!,"Ordered these based on reviews and was very dissapointed. They were badly broken up and tasted stale and very sticky, almost as if moisture had gotten to them."
1,"this cd found it's way to the ""used"" bin VERY quickly...","Some people call it ""shoegazing,"" ""melancholy,"" ""crushingly beautiful."" riiight.I think a more suitable description is ""lo-fi, echo-laden, downtuned emo crap.""-Justin, you can't sing no matter how much echo you add to your voice and you can downtune your guitar all you want to sound ""heavy,"" and try and hide from the fact that you've gone from an industrial/metal icon to a poppy emo crap saleman."
5,Glorious,"My previous exposure to Mr. Broadrick was a brief encounter with Godflesh, so I'm coming at this as someone with no fan baggage. I was listening to the stream of this on the Jesu website. The first song had me sit bolt upright, by the second, I was out the door to buy the cd. What a glorious din! Huge cathedrals of sound that send you up to the heavens. Imagine a cross between My Bloody Valentine and The God Machine. Or MBV and the Swans. This is amazing music that needs to be heard by people outside of the usual fanbase. Open your ears and give it a try."
2,Not the best pair of nail scissors.,"Pros: The scissors are nice and sharp. They are made by a good company.Cons: I think the scissors are too thick. They would work better if they were all around skinner. The grip on the scissors is very bulky and the cutting area is also thick and bulky. If I would have seen these in the store I would not have bought them. On the other hand, if you are a guy with bigger tougher toenails maybe these are the ones for you!"
5,The Voice,This is a great album. I learned about Vusi when he was featured on NPR. The mp3 download went without a hitch.
3,Wouldn't really get you in the mood....For Passion!,"Original artists do appear in this album, however I thought it was a pretty poor selection of songs trying to promote Passion! . I must admit I only like one song on it - Destiny by Jim Brickman. However the songs on it are fairly recent releases which kind of makes it bearable."
2,Dries to quickly,"I am not sure if all water based lubs are like this one, but I feel like the lub dried way to quickly, constant reapplication was necessary. I did not like it at all. Works fine if you only need it for a few seconds/minutes. But for long term use with high friction, this product or water based in general is not good."
1,What you see is not what you get,The product pictures is not what you will receive. I have brought this to Amazon but as of this date they have not removed the picture and replaced it with the correct one. What you will receive is a short patch cord and not a splitter.
3,"This album screams ""mediocrity""","This album doesn't have anywhere near the same energy as original Operation Ivy, but the one thing that I like (Though I'm not in the majority) is that the bands personalized the songs. If they did it exactly the way OpIvy played them, what would be the point of making the cd? I liked the Aquabats cover of knowledge, and CPD's cover of Sound System (Even though I'm not a CPD fan). I didn't like the version of Bad Town on this cd, but I appreciated the attempt by a hip-hop band. My biggest complaint is that they used RBF's version of Unity instead of Telegraph's. Telegraph does it much better."
1,Sorry but this is not operation ivy,Op ivy...one of the best bands to ever make music...homegrown....not so great. They arent even ska or punk rock really. And their cover sounds more like a pop song then an op ivy song. I must say tho rbf's cover isnt bad its played fast like op ivy should be and please please make sure that you know that op ivy is nothing like this. DO NOT BUY THIS
3,Take warning is an Ok cd,"its not too bad i gave it a 3 out of 5 rating.some songs are real good like the hippos freeze up,long beach dub all stars take warning,reel big fish unity and a few others. ....there werent realy any real punk band on this tehre are good ands that cover op ivy songs they should of put on here.millencollin,adhesive,suicide machines..."
2,Well... yeah,"When I first heard Operation Ivy at my friends house, I left feeling like I had just found a completely new music. I borrowed the CD from my friend and found out I was right. No other band has the sound, energy, or feeling of Op Ivy. A tribute, to me, should be something that pays homage, not laughs at. I don't like the idea of people insulting Op Ivy, but I won't get (angry)if it is just for fun. However, calling this a tribute album is a disgrace to Operation Ivy. Knowladge is laughed at, and all the serious songs (...). Buy Energy... Please"
1,IS THIS A FREAKING JOKE?????,"Bankshot by pocket lent is a perfect example of how this CD is more of an insult rather then a tribute to the amazing band Op Ivy. Sorry dudes, you totally screwed up. This is quite possibly the worst collection of covers I ever heard in my life. I feel embarassed just listening to it. its terrible. skip it. actually, smash it to pieces and burn it then feed it to your dog...believe me you dont want this crap. dont say I dident warn you."
1,LESS THAN ONE STAR IF THEY HAD IT,"What a disgrace. How could anyone take such a great badn, in Operation Ivy, and mutilate their songs. This is the worst compilation I have ever heard. Not one of these songs is worthy of praise. Ever cover on the album, sounds like it was just thrown together in about 5 minutes. The record company should have realized this and decided not to produce this album, for it is a disgrace to Op Ivy, and it takes respect from some good bands such as the hippos, My superhero ect. who have worked so hard for respect in the ska world, and now they lost is by putting out such horrible stuff. Dont even think about buying this album. You will be truly disapointed."
3,It was okay,"This cd was all right, but nothing compared to the original songs. The Home Grown and Reel Big Fish songs are dry and pretty stupid. Reel Big Fish does a really crappy job of covering one of Op Ivy's best songs, ""Unity"". Pocket Lent's version of ""Bankshot"" is pretty cool, better than the original, I think. The Blue Meanies -TOTALLY- changed the sound of ""Yellin' in my ear"", but it still sounds pretty cool. The Cherry Poppin' Daddies mangled ""Sound System"", my second favorite Op Ivy song, and made it sound all swingy and stupid. The Hippos did a pretty okay job of ""Freeze Up"", my favorite Operation Ivy song. The Long Beach Dub All Stars did ""Take Warning"" pretty well. Please buy the original before this one, because it is a lot better."
1,what a total piece of garbage,"i absolutely love operation ivy i think they were one of the greatest bands and when i heard about this cd comin out i was soo excited. i knew it would never be operation ivy but i expected way more than this. when i bought it, i got home and popped it in my cd player. i began to listen to it and very quickly the smile faded from my face. what complete and utter [junk] is this? i returned it the next day. if your payin tribute-PAY TRIBUTE. don't insult them and twist their music into horrible [junk] that no one wants to listen to. i know they could never compare to operation ivy, but man, some of these bands shouldn't even be famous."
2,WOW this is bad,"How is it possible to take such great songs and mangle them to a point where it's almost impossible to listen to. That question still baffles me, except for a song or two this album really sucks, i mean really SUCKS, the only reason I gave it a 2 was because the cd has to do with OpIvy. I hope every band out there has learned from this horrible display of crap, Leave these legendary songs to a legendary band."
3,The original is much better...of course,"However, this isn't bad! It's nice that people are paying their respects to Operation Ivy. It's suprising to me that these guys were only together for 2 years, yet they still influence music even today. The Hippos, LB Dub Allstars, and Longfellow do an especially good job. However, don't expect anything more than just remakes, and that's all this CD is. It costs twelve bucks, for which you can simply just buy Op Ivy's original CD and get the same idea. However, songs from this album are easy enough to aquire, and I recommend doing so."
1,take warning..really!!!!,"this album is total crap.these bands are everything op.ivy wasn't.bands like reel big fish,cherry poppin daddies and long beach all stars(aka-the living members of sublime)are just exploiting a really good band.i'm surprised no doubt and smashmouth aren't on here.they like to exploit good bands.(no doubt i feel exploited madness to hell)this album isn't worth a penny.anything you pay for this some of it goes to the bands and a lot of bands on here are swiming in the cash as it is.this is not a tribute!!!!if it were there would be bands that respect op.ivy and what they stood for.the album should be renamed...take warning operation ivy,you're being exploited."
1,not worth covering,"When my friend bought this, I had to check it out. It made me cringe. Operation Ivy was a band so down to earth and authentic to roots the lead singer quit because they got 'too big.' If you're looking for great ska-punk just by the original album. It's mindblowing in poetic beauty, catchiness, and plain energy. Covering the whole thing over-produced and such ruins the whole feeling the original band had which made it so special."
3,Not that bad really,"well,Operation IVy is one of the greatest ska influenced punk bands ever,but this album has too many flaws that must be polish,...even if I hate Reel Big Fish,their Unity cover it's quite alright,I liked Knowledge....just for be a classic and the cherry poppin'Daddies Song......buy it just if you're a truly Op.IVy fan......not if you're a poser just like you're friends...."
2,oh so sad,"its horrible that they made the songs sound this bad on the CD. Yeah, I agree whatever happened to the Telegraph ""Unity""? RBF are sellouts... well you have to give it some credit because some of the songs are ok, but I wouldn't buy this CD. Buy the original."
2,This Can Never Compare,"No band could ever pull off a remake of an Op Iv song, but this CD is, for the most part, pathetic. The only song that even comes close is ""Freeze Up"". Reel Big Fish fans will like ""Unity"" but most songs were changed so much that they're unrecognizable. Especially ""Bad Town"", the best song Op Iv ever came out with is totally screwed over and turned into hip-hop format. It's even bad hip-hop. Trust me, stick with the real Operation Ivy CD and you'll be much happier"
3,DIDN'T REACH MY EXPECTATIONS,"When I first saw this record, I was optimistic because it was sporting names like ""My Superhero"", and ""Teen Heroes"". In fact those were the only ones I liked. Reel Big Fish's cover was a mockery of a true punk rock band. However, if you buy it, you must be extremely flexible with your set of standards."
3,"Nice effect, but not easy to find bulbs...","These nite lites are charming, but it is damned hard to find replacement bulbs for them."
5,Jealousy is liberation,"Possibly the best track from the album ! When I first heard the song the player was stuck there for several repeats. A unusual variation on the end of a relationship ! Mellow without being melancholic, bitter without being twisted,is this the Sinead we all identify with ? Time has matured her music but her views on life still dominate her songs and this is no exception. A finer song full of emotion hasn't appeared since Fire on Babylon.Ignore this single at your own risk or buy the album for real enlightenment!"
5,Great southern history,"I passed by McClellanville every day on the way to Georgetown, SC on business and always admired the natural, untouched beauty of this community and the tenacity of the residents in this tiny southern town to keep the gentile, uncomplicated lifestyle that made the South THE place to live. This book is a well written, accurate and touching compilation of the history of this remarkable village and its people. Definitely a great read."
2,incomplete release from a vinyl source,"Yep, I grew up watching the Banana Splits. I even sesnt off for the four song EP, which is somewhere around here someplace. Anyhow, several have already mentioned the absence of two songs from the original Decca LP, so I won't talk about that. What I will discuss is the ever-present surface noise on this CD. The original two-track masters have to be out there somewhere. Somebody needs to license them from the Hanna-Barbere library and do a proper release. This release gets only two stars as, for me, it is only a temporary substitute until an officially licensed release is made available (if ever)."
5,Vista Simplified,"Although I'm an experienced computer user, Windows Vista Simplified helped me considerably. I would highly recommend this book to both beginners and experienced users."
5,Excellent product,"Excellent product for the price I paid, and the shipping is A+, the series of those books are the best for learn, has a lot of ilustrations wich simplified your life, I will recommended."
2,Not a basketball whistle,"This whistle is not meant for basketball. It sounds completely different from the Fox 40 mini or classic. It sounds like a water polo whistle. It has a much lower pitch. You want attention as a basketball official, this whistle will give it to you because people will be wondering what that sound was. Get the mini or the classic for basketball."
2,Ho Hum Batman,It doesn't do anything or make sounds. It's a nice figure of Batman and that's about it.
5,Mud no more,"I bought this to wear while crawling in my water soaked clay crawl space. Wow, after all the clothes and shoes I have thrown away after doing this, the product is wonderful. It cleans off with a towel or let it dry and shake it off. I installed one of the great 10 string construction lights I bought here and I am now able to see the ooze I want to stop, stay clean and clean these up easily for future use."
1,Simply Pathetic,"I LOVE Buffett, and bought this on the recomendation of some loyal, and apparently hearing impared, Buffett fans. The sound quality appears to be mono, as if someone placed the recorder in front of a bad amp in Jabanoski's bathroom. The lyrics are simple and Bill's simply trying too hard to write songs. His voice is flat and one-dimensional. It reminds me of the guy playing outside of Terminal 1 at O'Hare Airport for spare change.It's really that bad, and I rarely review the things I buy on Amazon. I wish I could return it. Save your money."
1,Please Make It Stop!!,"When he's telling a story and not singing, Bill is not bad. But when he sings... let's just say Bill's voice resembles fingernails on a chalkboard. It was agonizing listening to the whole CD. Granted there are a ""few"" songs that were bearable, but over all not what I was expecting after all the rave reviews. The overpriced CD has the look and sound of a low budget production. I would not recommend purchasing this to anyone."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,This is a big waste of money. The production is very poor. For this price it should at least sound like it was not recorded in his basement. Save your money and buy something else. I shoild have listened to the other reviewer. STAY AWAY!
2,I guess I just don't get it,"The sound quality on several of the cuts is terrible. At least three of the songs sound like a cheap keyboard was used as back-up. I thought most of the songs were not well written. I wish I had listened to ""music fan"" in his many guises and saved my money. However, ""The Man Who Got Thrown Out of the Green Parrot"" is so funny I laughed out loud even though I was by myself."
3,Learn how to spell,"This is for the reviewer, ""Sweet Home Alabama"". Hear means to listen with your ears, Here is wherever you are. ""Reviewer"" is not spelled with ""ei"", rather ""ie"". I guess you weren't paying attention in second grade when everyone else learned, ""I before E except after C or when sounded as A as in neighbor and weigh."" I don't even know what your review was about because I couldn't get past the misspelled words."
5,DUVAL STREET ON A DISC,Only been to Key West once but I'm planning a return trip real soon. Wild town and this CD captures it just perfect. Hope Jabanoski is playing in town in the Duval Street bars when I go back. If he's this good on disc I can't wait to see him LIVE.
1,Terrible,How annoying is this CD?!?! I bought it before a trip to Key West and prayed this guy wasn't playing at any bars I would be going to. Vocals and writing are the some of the worst I've heard. How did this ever get produced???
1,Garbage/Not music!,I feel like a fool spending $15 on this trash. This is not music and the recoring quality is extremely poor. Bill just reads some of his essays to the strum of a cheap guitar. Amazon.com should pull this garbage from its shelves. Jeff Bezos...I want my money back!!! I am not a happy customer. Next time I'm in Key West I am looking Bill J. up and get my money back.
1,I hate it!,"Sorry, I guess I was expecting something very different. I found this one to be un-listen-able ... painful, actually. I would get my money back if I could. This is the first time Amazon's recommendation has disappointed me."
1,What a waste of time and money!,"You have to wonder why any company would waste resources and money to produce a cd of an ""artist"" with this low ability both musically and lyrically. This isn't even worth trying to re-sell. It went over the transom. Jimy has no competition here."
5,An Unbelievable Truth,"I have been studying the Holocaust in depth for a few years now, when I came across this autobiography. This novel opened my eyes to the torture techniques the Nazis used to gather information. Every appalling detail ground into my mind, until I had to openly share this novel with my colleagues and students. Sam's fight to survive with all the odds stacked against him shows the true battle between good and the most horrifying evil the world has ever seen. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants a good look at what life was like in a concentration camp and under the gallows."
4,pleasant surprise,I originally watched Loss Of A Teardrop Diamond because I love Chris Evans but I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely recommend this movie.
4,Simply Beautiful,"Sometimes I can't seem to remember a romance that's been beautifully told. Well, from my point of view, anyway. Deeply appreciated!"
4,Several Short Familiar Pieces for Kids,"My kids and I are teaching ourselves how to play these instruments and we are using these three CD's to hear how some short, familiar songs are *supposed* to sound. I did not like any of the selections on Disc 1, piano, but the other two discs had a lot of simple, pleasant-sounding ones. The recording quality is very good on all three.Complaint: The discs are practically not labeled! One must look at the case to see the song numbers and names. Worse, the discs have ""disc one,"" ""disc two,"" and ""disc three"" printed on them, but the cases don't say which is which, piano, flute, or strings! I'm going to write ""piano,"" ""violin and cello,"" and ""flute"" on each disc with a paint pen, or write 1,2,3 on the cases."
4,It is a wonderful book of God's love for our soul.,"This book clearly let's the reader know that we are on life's journey, traveling to meet God one day but, there are lessons that we must learn on this journey and our love ones who have gone on will help us and continue to communicate with us until we meet God one day. This book has cause me to read two others similar books that talks about life's journey and communicating with our love ones, One Last Time by John Edward, and Talking to Heaven by James Van Praagh."
5,Excellent 2-disc comp of PWOG's singles,"That pretty much says it all. It collects stuff from Exit 23, Kraak, Obsidian, etc. This electronic act isn't for everyone - listen to the samples and you'll either find it monotonous or mesmerizing. More trance-like than their excellent Ov Biospheres and Sacred Grooves."
4,Good Introduction to Pagan Thought,"This book is a good introduction to different streams of thought within the Pagan community. Authors from various traditions share essays on topics such as the basics of magic, politics in Paganism, and the role nature plays in this path. Dorothy Morrison, Freya Aswynn, Kerr Cuhulain, Amber K, Starhawk, and Raven Grimassi are just a few of the elders who contribute to this book. Because of the varied opinions of the authors, you are bound to disagree with some of them. You will learn something about different Pagan paths however.Kristin Madden has done a wonderful job of compiling the book into a logical sequence. However, if you want a how-to book on a specific tradition, this isn't the book for you. It would be a good primer for Pagan teachers to have on their bookshelf for students very new to Paganism."
5,book review,The book came in a timely manner and was in the condition that was posted. I am very happy with the sender. Thanks :-)
3,Book review,"This book was required reading for a course that I attended. It's a bit outdated, but overall has good information in it."
5,PHOTO PAPER,The BEST PHOTO PAPER for QUALITY PRINTS.. Color is GREAT PHOTOS are Clear and CRISP wot the Money for this.. I Highly rfeccommend this. This is the BEST
3,Mouseproofing 101,"In the Peruvian Priory where St Martin lives, the mice have overstayed their welcome and cats and traps are in their future. Through persuasion and prayer, Martin leads the mice out of the building and they never return. Except for the odd way the illustrator dressed the mice (Disney-itis?) the story is realistically told and illustrated. perhaps inspiring young readers to figure out how other cultures dealt with mice in the cupboards."
1,Looks cheap because it is cheap!,"Two broke! I bought one, exchanged it after a few weeks because it started ticking but never actually ringing. Second one started rattling inside after just a few weeks and just doesn't work. It went In the trash, where I should have put my $10 to begin with, saved my energy."
1,The only thing good about this book is the trademark.,"What can I possibly say that is GOOD about this book?? The Blade Runner trademark! I guess that's all Jeter needed to sell this book. Obviously so, because the book itself is only useful for emergency burning paper.It suffers from the 2nd book's replay of the movie's events, ONLY MUCH MUCH WORSE. There were just TOO many replays this time, and it just became a rediculous ""Find The Replays"" Activity Book!My advice (and apparently many others' too) is to skip this installment of the Blade Runner books. Just pretend you never saw it...."
2,From the Past and the Into the Future,"All the characters were familiar and that can be a big draw in reading a work in a series. There's a feeling of comfort since you know them, even if you don't particularly find them attractive.The opening will be confusing if you don't know the characters and maybe will be anyway. It jumps from a scene being filmed to the action and back again. In the end you see the same cast as the original movie doing pretty much the same stuff as before.I found the book to be tedious as he retold old scenes from the movie and wove them into the new plot. I would rather have had new material covering new ground entirely, but that is a personal preference.I did not finish this book completely and probably will not do so."
1,Blade Ruiner,"Phil Dick was strange and maybe that's why his stories were appealing. Ridley Scott did a masterful job making Dick's disjointed writing into a classic dark and dystopian science fiction film. Replicant Night ignobly retires the concept by forcing where it should never have gone. Based on the film and not Dick. Noir becomes gris. Pure drek. Nothing original. No real story. So plodding I had to stop about half way through. I can't tell you how it ends because the author simply made it so I could not care less. Why do I have an image now of Deckard in a wife-beater, as Willy Lomond living a life of dissipated desperation? Damn you Jeter."
1,Otumma tumma ladin...,needs to be shotpure landfill garbage. if i could give it lower than 1 star i would.
4,Case Replacement,"Sakura Wars is a great collection but the DVD case needs lots of work.it's ridiculous that someone would aloud these disk to be stacked on top of each otherin a single tab.It took a while to find the perfect replacementbecause certain companies don't sell just one DVD case but will try tosell you 50 or more.but i found a replacement booklet DVD case holder with 4 slots for the DVD andall i had to buy was one, a couple of dollars but well worth it.if you need to know where to get a replacementGoogle u.s. plastic corp and look for the tab DVD casesit was hard to find an inch think case with 4 slot but its in thereand the graphic sheets fit perfectly in there too"
2,Okay but didn't really grab me,"I love science fiction romance and while this book was okay, it didn't really grab me. I finished it because I paid for it. It was written okay, no glaring plot holes and the premise was interesting but somehow it just was a little dull. The hero was not really well developed and the heroine was a bit one dimensional. The relationship between the two lacked heat and I couldn't really see why he loved her. He was also the only human man she had any major interaction with and I guess I felt like I do about people who marry the first boy they date right out of high school. ""Don't buy the first horse you look at!"" The plot was pretty predictable. So not a total waste of money but I wish I'd borrowed instead of buying it."
1,Junkware,Needle is loose from first use before I even got to inject anything. Had to glue it to the plastic syringe body to get one use out of it.I think you need to buy metal if you are going to be doing this often.
4,Simple and does the job,"This injector is very simple to use and works well for its intended purpose. I bought this to use for refilling soap dispensers and it can be a little overly messy. The rubber stopped makes a great seal, which is good for injecting, but not so good when having to remove and refill the syringe. Since the deal is so tight is actually can bring the liquid back out when the stopper is removed and it will drip everywhere. Again, if you are using this as an actual sauce injector then chances are you won't be removing the stopped 10 times per use and it won't be an issue."
2,HORRIBLE GAMEPLAY,"i've bought all the NFL games since 1998, and this one is actually the worse of them all. It has a great franchise mode, but the gameplay is just awful. there are far too many bugs exploited by the computer that result in long BS plays. you will find yourself buying a new controller every week to replace the one you broke against the wall after a 90 yard TD pass on 3rd and 25."
3,"Ok, I guess...","Its just an average football game. Nothing really special about it. Gameplay isn't to bad. I own it and play it once and a while. I'm not personally a fan of the Madden series, but if you're the type who likes to sit down and play a good game of football, this game is for you. And its dirt cheap if you buy it used."
2,Big disappointment,"I gave this 2 stars for the new Owner Mode. You have to manage the team's finances, which is fun.What I don't like about the game is that it's too easy at the Rookie level, but too difficult at the Pro level. The defensive backs must be able to run a 1.1 40 and jump 20 feet in the air because of the ridiculous interceptions I've seen in this game.The graphics aren't an improvement over prior years of Madden. Plus, you would like some commentary with the game, but you have to listen to that incredibly annoying, clueless John Madden."
1,FAKE,RECIEVED FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND IT WAS A MADDEN KNOCK-OFF! THE ONLY THING THAT WAS 2004 ABOUT THE GAME WAS THE UPDATED LOGOS.
5,Rita's best,"Her songs on this album are fabulous, especially for a blues singer like me. I love practicing with her songs as if I am singing with her. I enjoy changing the songs to fit my style, then singing Karoki."
4,A great resource for women of color,I recommend this book for first time moms of color. It has been a great resource to me and my family.
4,Great resource!,"When writing my book,[...] I was dismayed to see how few books there were that addressed issues Black women face when breastfeeding. There is overwhelming evidence that shows the lack of support Black women receive when it to breastfeeding. Ms. Barber's guide is timely, effective, and most of all tailored to meet the needs of the African-American community.Keleigh Crigler Hadley"
5,Better than before,"N wireless capability, up to 4GB RAM support, X3100 integrated graphics and Leopard installed along with reinstallation DVD, and 800 MHz Front Speed Bus, the new MacBook is better than previous ones.I received the laptop just on time, and it was on great condition. After 3 minutes I was ready to roll. I am a new switcher and it takes a little time to get used to it, and I still have to learn lots of cool stuff.The only con I can tell is the boot time. In tiger it was around 25 seconds, but with leopard it is around 37 seconds."
5,Great computer,"I greatly recommend this computer. It's very fast and rather light weight. The battery has a long life and the graphic quality is wonder full. It also has a web cam which I like.On the down side it only comes with a mac word trial, but it does have text edit so that's not a big deal."
4,Not exactly what I ordered,I ordered this white MacBook 13inch 2.2 GHz computer and what I got was a white MacBook 13inch 1.83 GHz computer. It is a slightly older model but it operates well and had a new battery and charger as promised. The only complaint I have at this point is that I would like to have been notified of the substitution of an older model computer.
2,"nice package, but very unreliable","I thought I'd try the alternative to Windows machines, and it's been a big disappointment. While the MacBook is sleek and sexy, it's also extremely unreliable; the operating system crashes at least every day. Apple pumps out OS updates on a regular basis, but nothing has improved this crash-prone white elephant. It crashes much more frequently than my recent Windows machines, which says a lot, since Windows is none too trustworthy.That said, I like the physical layout, the size & weight, and the Mac applications. If only they worked all the time--or even more of the time, I'd say they have a superior product. But, unhappily, it just ain't so."
5,College computer,"I purchased this computer for my daughter leaving for college. I've never been a supporter of Apple products, but... this is an incredible machine. It is now much more apparent the short falls of the Microsoft Operating System. I'm not ready yet to make the jump to a Mac, but the commercials on TV sure tell the whole story. Thanks MAC for staying in there through the hard times.PS: We are still using Microsoft Office for Mac, it's a great tool."
