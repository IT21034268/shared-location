4,Grad Student in Need of a Quick Learn,"I'm a graduate student in psychology and I need to learn some math fairly quickly for my studies. So not being a ""dummy"", I decided to leave the ""guide"" to the idiots and buy a book to ""demystify"" concepts I learned long ago, and teach me new ones I have not yet come across. The book has been great so far and is worth the buy!"
2,Okay book for wannabe mathematicians,"This book is okay for people who are looking for a text slightly better than the mandatory class text book. It rarely states things in a straight forward easy to understand way. Instead it uses all the same jargon and proofs found in any other math text book. I understand it is difficult to get away from some of the jargon, but I know it is possible to explain math in a more practical way. Unfortunately, this book is much more like the class room explanation. It has obviously been written by a mathematician. If you are looking for a more practical approach to solving pre-calc equations, look elsewhere!"
1,How to Make Precalculus Mystifying,"Books with titles such as X ""Made Easy"" or X ""Demystified"" should always be treated with caution and suspicion. And this is one of them. I have worked through Algebra Demystified and was pleasently surprised - but this volume did justify its title. Thinking that the same author would do something along the same lines with Precalculus Demystified - I was very disappointed. I'm not a complete dunderhead in maths but I did expect somewhat more of an explanation at each step. A word or two of WHY so-and-so is done in precalculus would not have gone amiss. This book is just another maths book with next to no explanation - just examples and problems. Some graphical illustration, for example, in Chapter 4 would have been enormously helpful. My volume is going cheap on Amazon second hand market."
3,Ahh...ok,"Its ok but not catchy. I couldn't get into reading it. Just didn't keep my attention. I guess you can give it a try, but from what I remember it wasn't that great."
2,Not what I expected,"These filters will work, but they were not what I expected. I thought they were Sears brand, but they are a cheaper knock off packaged in flimsy plastic bags."
4,"well-integrated listening, speaking, and grammar","The book is attractive and laid out well...easy to find your way around. The tapes are clear, and in the first few lessons, very slow. Each chapter contains a grammar lesson, some vocabulary, and a dialogue illustrating both. There are also a few ""quizzes"" scattered along the way. The dialogues tell a story, which progresses from chapter to chapter, culminating in an ""epilogue"" at the end, telling what happened to the characters. The device sounds a little silly, but actually was rather motivating! The only real fault in the course was that there wasn't enough repetition. Some words appeared only once or twice in the dialogues...it would have been preferable to hear them several times, to develop the ability to recognize them in new contexts."
4,First show I ever saw,"This was the first Broadway show I ever saw in my life. My cousin Augie Rios played the boy in it. I was 6 years old, and after that I got the fever. I met Ricardo Montalban, as a matter of fact, as they would say in Chorus Line, I had my little white hat, my little white gloves etc etc. It was the show that changed my life and I still have the album. Music has always been a part of my life since then. So to me this show rates a 10, and so does the album."
5,My First B'way Show,"A neighbor lady took me to see this when I was still in grammar school. My first Broadway show. It could have been a memorable evening for that event alone, but I remember being overwhelmed by the colorful costumes and sets. And, when it comes to seeing a legendary performer, very few can match Lena Horne. She was wonderful. The music and lyrics are still excellent after all of these years. I have an old LP of the original cast recording and added the CD version as soon as it was released. This recording is a theatrical treasure trove of B'way in it's heyday."
3,This book is definately for beginners,"This book is for beginners, and beginners only. I have been working with System V, BSD Unix, and Linux for over 2 years. This book, at best, refreshed my memory on certain aspects of the system. For people looking for an indepth look at unix administration, I would recommend looking elsewhere, because this book will only lead to boredom and a $50 dent in your wallet. If you are new to Unix, then this book is right up your alley. It is laid out very well, and has a nice, easy to read format."
3,Frustrating at times,"This book can be really frustrating at times. Let's say that you're trying to get a Sun box on a network, and you forget to edit /etc/nsswitch.conf to specify dns lookup for hosts. You'll have a tough time with this book as your only reference - as far as I can tell this isn't discussed in this book at all. Why not?There are other examples. I often end up searching for additional information elsewhere. Your mileage may vary."
4,Best Book for Solaris,"I've read all the books on Solaris, and this one seems to be the best. Sun's own books (Winsor) pale in comparison. That said, I don't think this book is detailed enough. I wish it had more coverage on how Solaris runs for different versions and for different hardware. There is hardly any coverage of Solaris on x86, which would have been great, since there are no books on that topic available. You'll get a lot out of this book, but you'l also be wishing for more."
3,Decent book for begining Solaris Admins,"This is a pretty decent book for begining Solaris Admins, BUT, it only covers up to Solaris 2.6. If you are administrating Solaris 7 or 8 I would look elsewhere or wait for the next edition."
2,Save your money and buy a better book,"If you are in the market for some technical information about Solaris, this book is not for you. It is a very general beginners guide and does not come close to discussing the ""real world"" issues that are faced in administering Solaris in an Enterprise environment.To top it all off, there are numerous typos and just plain wrong information that the somewhat experienced reader will notice. This bothers me since the author of a book should be a subject matter expert before writing it! Other books are better... buy them instead."
2,Not for you if your interested in learning Solaris for x86!,"I picked this book to learn about Solaris 2.5.x which I have installed at my Intel workstation at my job. When I started reading this book I was very interested but it does not cover enough details. I wanted to learn how to configure and run OpenWindows but this book had a total of two pages on the subject (if not less). Sorry to say, I wish I could have returned it."
5,Wonderful reading,I love the CD's . It is difficult to turn the CD player off when I get into the word. It's a wonderful version.
1,Monotone voice leads to boring bible,"I get lost listening to the monotone voice of Stephen Johnston all the time. This use to be the only bible that I listened to, until the word of promise came out in 2007, which I purchased this year. The word of promise is by far superior to this bible, with more antimated scenes, lively voices, and better background music. It use to be a great bible if you dont know any better."
3,Get the older one instead,"I got this set after sampling the older version of this product (still available, ISBN: 0842354468); and I'm disappointed with the reader's voice (Stephen Johnston). The more mature voice in the older edition is clearer and conveys the emotions so much better. While this is marketed as the dramatized version and the other version not, there are very few negligible differences between the two versions as far as the dramatizations are concerned; the bible is mostly narrations anyway. I guess some people do like Stephen Johnston's deep voice, but unless you've heard and prefer his voice, get the other version instead."
2,Bible-semi alive,"the reader as the voice of Christ appears to be without emotion in driving out the money changers and even dying on the cross. Other actors/readers were often wonderful in speaking with feeling. The text, of course, was flawless, but the narrator spoke without feeling. The title Alive! did not reflect the actual recording. After listening to the cd one wonders why the money changers ever left the temple!This cd has merit, but is certainly not the Bible Alive!"
4,I love it.,"I originally purchased the KJV narrated by Alexander Scourby. Boy, what a mistake. The audio quality was horrible. Then I tried this product. I am amazed at the quality of the production. Very nice. I definitely recommend the Bible Alive! I am in the car about two hours a day and now I can listen to the Word of God."
2,"Poorly focused on law, focuses too much on technology","This is a good book for law beginers, but would be a a thriller bestseller for computer geeks. It focuses so much on the technology involved that it gets way out of focus on the main topic: Internet Law. It does not states the main legal problems of the Internet as such, but keeps redudant on the backbone that keeps the www functioning"
2,"Poorly focused on Law, way too much on the technology","This is a good book for law beginers, but would be a a thriller bestseller for computer geeks. It focuses so much on the technology involved that it gets way out of focus on the main topic: Internet Law. It does not states the main legal problems of the Internet as such, but keeps redudant on the backbone that keeps the www functioning"
4,"This is a very odd, blended, and wacko compilation of songs.","Well I've seen the movie. When I start watching I see a New York city in red. Then the ""Summer In The City"" song starts playing and this is a good song, but then I listen to the rest. ""Surfing In The Aquaduct"" and ""In Front Of The Kids"" are just slow, dreary rap songs which blur along. ""The Ants Go Marching"" is a mood-setter and is really good but when on a soundtrack, on it's own, it starts to fall behind. In the movie it all fits in. Even Beethoven or Mozart or whoever are in there but theydon't wreck it because they're old. Even though the Die Hard With A Vengeance Soundtrack was a bit slow, and it only had a few good ( but old ) songs, I thought they didn't need to be picked on. If they come from the movie, and they fit the movie, and the movie is good, who cares whhther it's a bad soundtrack or not. Get along."
4,The CD Is Above Average,"Overall, I enjoy listening to ""Die Hard With A Vengeance."" The score becomes boring at times, but the exciting tracks, ""Summer In The City"" and ""Got It Covered"" make up for it. Michael Kamen is an experienced composer; his product is an acceptable score combined with an above average soundtrack."
1,Warning,"A collection of ""ethnic"" rap tunes and some poorly played classical pieces are the sum total of this horrible CD. Be warned that in the movie ""When Johnny Came Marching Home"" is played continuously but is no where to be found in the Soundtrack.While the soundtrack does have Beethoven's 9th symphony it is played so horribly that it does not make this a worthy purchase.Buyer beware."
2,A poor soundtrack,"For some reason this soundtrack has completely missed the mark. There are some songs on it, but mostly rap, (Thank god they included Summer In The City by The Loving Spoonful), some classical pieces, but I don't recall Beethoven's Ninth being in the movie, and some additional score. If you're looking for a soundtrack with a cool collection of songs, you're in the wrong place. If you're a ""real"" soundtrack collector, you'll be disappointed that the ""Ants Go Marching"" theme, which was featured so prominently in the film, can't be found anywhere on this soundtrack.About half the CD consists of score, and since the original ""Die Hard"" album was never commercially released ... the only real reason for buying this album is to get as much of the legendary ""Die Hard"" score as possible... And now they've even stopped printing this album..."
1,Don't get ripped off,"Well...I have only one thing to say about this soundtrack selection. Whoever created this soundtrack was on ""CRACK!"" and needs to be removed from the music industry. I mean how can the ""Main"" score in the movie not in the soundtrack selection? This is like going to Disneyland and not see Mickey but Bugs Bunny? (No ofense to Bugs. I love you :p) Too bad I found this review way too late till after I have purchased it. (for $0.01) I think this soundtrack ain't worth listening to or better yet...to be looked at. For the price I've paid, I think I got ripped off.BTW if anyone know where I can get my hands on the movie version of ""When Johnny came marching Home"" the acoustic version and also the Man's Chore version. Please share with the world. I think the people of the world will be very happy to find that someone do care for another's love for ""GOOD MUSIC"". :D"
2,Why did I pay for this!?,"Don't get me wrong, this CD has it's moments, it's just, they are few and far apart.I was kinda hoping for more than this. Like the theft. That neat little marching tune that started with a piece from ""Flight of the Valkyries"" (did I spell that right?) and ""The Ants go Marching 1 by 1"" (okay, I know that isn't the real name, but thats all I know it by). Seriously though, a true Die Hard fan would probably recognize the theme song, placed in many of the songs on the CD. Anyone else, you'd probably get a better song if you held a tape recorder up to the TV while the credits roll."
2,Yikes! Western myth at its most interesting...,"In reading this book, I was moved to wonder if it was 2002 or 1965. While not a bad story, the author gets so many details wrong that he must have used ""Hang 'em High"" as his only source.Not a bad book, but totally fiction, pure and simple.."
2,Jaded...,"I know, one wishes for it to never happen, but sooner or later it always does...Eventually Corey let me down..This album by Corey is the one i really cannot relate to.The lyrics are way too obscure, the musical production is just a mess...He sounds jaded, tired...seems not even enjoying his music talent anymore.There are a couple oftracks that save the day of course, otherwise i would have brought this back to the store rightaway...LA-BAS is a nice duet written and sung in french by Corey and new wifey Julie Masse, written and produced by the same team behind Celine Dion's most successful french tunes.SO VISIBLE (EASY TO MISS) is a fun track, reminds me of SPOT YOU IN A COALMINE.The rest...well, better luck next time Corey!"
2,Not recommended for larger sizes,"I love the quality of these socks but I have size 9 feet and they were snug for that size when they arrived. Once they went through the wash/dry, they shrunk to the point where the sock is not long enough for my foot. The preformed heel ends up in the arch of my foot and pulls the socks down constantly. Very annoying and I won't wear them anymore."
3,Keep your shoes on,"These socks are so comfy, but if I don't have my shoes on, they slide off my feet! The elastic is not tight enough at the ankle."
2,Large seam at toe,If you don't like a large seam at the toe of your sock then don't buy these. My husband got the six pack of men's gold toe socks and the seam on his socks is very flat (GREAT).
5,Best of the Best,"Love everything about these socks. The thickness is not too thick and not too thin. That just right weight of material that works year-round. I am a plus size woman and they fit my calf perfect, but would fit a petite woman too. The cotton material is stretchy, but goes right back into shape after a wash! Delivery was earlier than scheduled and they were packaged securely. I ordered 3 more sets of these socks after wearing 1st set and washing to make sure I loved them. Gold Toe Women's 3-pack Weekend Sock, size9-11 is what I ordered. LOVE THEM AND THE SELLER!!!!!"
2,Lumpy toes,"I purchased these socks because I have always loved Gold Toe socks and they are usually a brand that you can count on to have smooth toes. I wanted thicker socks for the cold weather that is coming and when these arrived I was very pleased with their appearance and thickness. However, I can't wear any of them because the seam at the toe is so thick that it is painful to wear these socks with any shoes or slippers."
3,nice enough if you aren't wearing boots,I was looking for a midweight dark sock that could be used with some looser flats I own. These are a nice thickness and maintained their color after washing. They aren't the softest socks I own but I guess that's to be expected with the thickness. The one annoying thing I have found is that they don't stay up when I am wearing boots. They end up falling in to the bottom of the boot and getting all scrunched under my foot. Pretty uncomfortable. They seem fine with other shoes.
5,best socks ever!,i have looked and looked. these socks are unparalleled. perfect mix of cotton and very durable. they last a LONG time.
5,Great socks!,"These are soft, comfortable, and have stood up to a few washings with no sign of wear & tear. I would definitely recommend them."
5,My favorite socks EVER!,"I am very picky about socks. I prefer as close to 100% cotton as possible because they are so much more comfortable and healthy. I can't believe how much I love these socks. They fit so well, they are a little thick, but not too thick. They stay in place and wear very comfortably throughout a long day. I'm ordering another pack today!"
4,Nice socks - but not just black,"The socks were exactly as described. They are thicker than ""dress"" socks, but that's what I wanted. I was disappointed that 1 of 3 were grey when I thought I was getting all black."
3,Aren't near the quality of the of the gold toe turn cuffs.,These socks seemed to shrink alot when washed. Didn't not hold their shape like the turn cuff yellow toe socks did.
3,a bit on the thicker side,"Love Gold Toe socks; however, was expecting a thinner material. They are great for the cooler weather, though; and, I know I'll make good use of them. Quality is still very good."
5,"Thick, comfy socks","These are great casual socks- perfect for lounging or wearing with boots. They are thick enough that they could probably be used for hiking, as well."
3,Not that soft,"These socks came at a good price, but they are really not very soft. I think they are pretty warm, however I wish they were more comfortable."
3,Durability?,I do like the feel of these socks but I have a major problem with them. Two out of the three pairs I purchased either came with holes in the toe area or developed a hole within only half a day of wearing them! I used them in a normal fashion and noticed the holes at night... I did not feel like going through the trouble of returning them but sewed it shut myself instead. Works fine and like I said they do have a nice feel and are very comfortable. Good for the fall and winter season.
1,Shoddy quality and falsely advertised,"These socks arrived already unraveling at the top before I even unpacked them. These have to be the most poorly made socks I ever purchased (and I remember Gold Toe making good socks when I was a kid). It also didn't help that they were falsely advertised as 87% cotton. They are not. The label says they have only 54% cotton on the upper part and 84% on the foot. Some people may not mind this, and had they not been unraveling, I would have kept them, but it seems wrong to claim to be made of more cotton than they are."
2,Very Disappointed with Tight Top Band,"The weight of the knit is perfect, but the tight top band makes it impossible for me to keep them on very long. My nerve endings in my shins are hypersensitve due to a neurological condition, and that makes socks with a tight upper band impossible to enjoy. Quality is A-One, but the comfort for me was not there."
3,Thick socks,"These socks are very comfortable and soft but they are a thicker, heavier weight than I was expecting, and I prefer a lighter sock. So they are a 3 for me, but could easily be a 5 for you if you like toasty toes."
3,nice sock but do not consider them plus size,"Good quality sock, but not really plus size in the ankle/leg area. Did not seem stretchy enough. I will have to pass them on to my boys who wear 8 men's size."
2,Too thin,"The socks are too thin. There was no way I could tell from the on-line descriptions about the weight of the sock. You use words like ""weekend"" etc. I'd appreciate a straighter shot at what I'm buying. Please describe weight of the fabric somehow."
4,sock it to 'em!,"I wore these socks during the week even though they are weekend socks. They were nice and covered my feet. They can be worn with shoes nicely. The are a stretchy, cottony wonderland for your feet."
5,POP GOES THE EYE CAKE,"Pop goes eye color with this exceptional eye palette that offers five compatible shades ranging from the most subtle hue to the deepest tone. No more reaching for different cakes of shadow to make sure all is simpatico - your best choices are here in this 2 ?"" round eye cake.For instance, my current favorite is ""Blue Eyes."" In the a.m. I can apply a soft blue on the lids, using the palest ice blue for under the brow. If day goes into an exciting evening (don't we all hope for that?) then I simply accent both the lid and under brow shades with deeper tones.A narrow shader brush works best with this palette, and even if you slip the slightest it isn't noticeable as all the tones are harmonious. Color is long lasting and doesn't tend to fade as the hours go by. Plus, the price is certainly affordable for such a variety of colors.- Gail Cooke"
3,doesn't stay on well,"The colors are really pretty, but the eyeshadow does crease, fade, and wipe off easily. I probably wouldn't buy it again because I have to reapply it constantly."
1,Not the color I ordered/didn't match picture,"I got this makeup very quickly. It was wrapped in bubble wrap in a bubble wrap envelope. Some of the dark green stripe chipped off. But the mix was all dark green olive colors not the one with the lighter colors/i.e. highlighter colors with it. I use brushes to put on my eyeshadow and even with good ones, the color was about the same as cover girl (as far as coverage). I'm sure wet application or with a good base it would be OK, but isn't ANY shadow like that? This just doesn't have the impact/hue. I didn't expect much because of the cost, but getting the right color would have been a plus. I don't want to have to pay shipping to return this item. That's the problem getting items like this on line, unless you have seen it in person. Its going to be a risk. However, they really should make sure the pictures match the actual item. Boo!"
4,How to carve leather,"This book is the best ""how to"" text I have ever come across. It is not so simple that it insults one's intelligence, nor so complicated and jargon-ridden that one wants to strangle the author. The illustrations are very Western United States but for those willing to learn, it is a way of branching out from the standard cowboy and indian expressions."
2,Just a hint at a great voice,"Others have noted that this recording was made in 1956. Of course it is not in stereo, and it sounds like an old acoustic recording. One needs to be a profound Callas-ophile to want to have this album in your collection.Giulini gets a pretty good hand from the hyper-critics at La Scala for his overture.Listening to Callas on this recording is a bit like looking at beautiful scenery through a very dirty window: you can sense the greatness of the voice or the beauty of the scene, but you aren't going to get much else out of this recording."
4,Callas shines in a legendary performance.,This performance by Maria Callas is remarkable for its depth and emotional power. Callas was in good voice during this period and made some great recordings. This preserves a live performance and the sound is above average.
5,good counting book,"Listen, my kids love the ""little monkeys"" but I used this one to teach my ""almost"" 4 yr old to count up to and past 100. As reader you might be tempted to gloss over the counting but if your kid is ready this is a great way to teach them to count. Add it to your library so you'll have when they are ready. I was amazed none of the other reviews emphasized this point, so I just had to add my two cents."
5,The Monkey Fun Continues,"It is very fun for my preschoolers to have different Five Little Monkey Stories, since they are all so engaging. Combined with the little finger puppets it provides long periods of fun, learning, and creativity for the children."
5,Fun,This is a fun addition to the rest of Our 5 Little monkey books! Love the way the rhymes flow with each other. My girls LOVE (3 1/2) finding where the monkeys are hiding! Another Great book by Eileen Christelow!
3,Not bad.,"Ellen Christelow, Five Little Monkeys Play Hide and Seek (Clarion, 2004)Five little monkeys, a babysitter, and rhyme. Mama's gone out dancing, and babysitter Lulu is enticed to play hide-and-seek with the FLM long after bedtime as Christelow imparts basic counting to her readers. Cute as always, and a Christelow original, which are always stronger than the adapted entries in the series. ***"
1,Doesn't really capture interest,"I thought my 18 month daughter would enjoy this book, especially since she was a fan of the ""Five Little Monkeys Jumping on a Bed"". But this book never captured her interest. I have never gotten past the 3rd page... till this day, I still don't know how the story ends!"
1,Girl is boring without her housewives!!,A very bad spinoff with a very obnoxious woman who never stops talking ever! Loved the real housewives but she is just way too annoying to have her own show its just her rambling and trying to get attention the whole show. All in all this spinoff sucks the real housewives is 100 times better!
4,Marlin's T-Shirt,"I was pleased to find the Marlin's T-Shirt thru Amazon.com . My Grandson is a fan of that Baseball team and I had been having problems finding the logo'd shirts anywhere, though we live in Florida.I thought the price was right and I hope the shirt fits,(it's a Christmas present)The order was delivered in a timely manner."
1,Mostly Debunked Urban Legends,"I took a look at this book at the library recently. It is merely a bunch of mostly debunked urban legends. There may actually be some true stories in this book, but you would have to do a lot of research to figure out which ones are actually true.Read News of the Weird (which normally has real stories), or one of the on-line Urban Legend sites if you want to be entertained by such stories. This book is a waste of money. Save your time and trouble and pass on this one."
4,great relaxing music,I love this cd. I lost my previous copy and HAD to buy it again. The music is very relaxing and is perfect for meditation. Several of the songs are reminiscent of Gregorian chants with a modern flair. Anyone in massage therapy should own this cd. The music reaches to your inner depth and brings it on a spirtual journey to peace and relaxation. I highly recomend this cd to anyone searching for music to relax the mind and body.
2,Original & reverent Gregorian chants,Oracle is the pseudonym for Joe Taylor who has released four albums to date (2002) of various musical styles. This is his debut and employs the Choir of Mount Angel Abbey for his eleven Gregorian chants. I listened many times but never developed a taste. Good production but I can not recommend unless you are predisposed to male voices singing reverently.
1,Must have missed something,"I certainly must have missed something that the other 2 reviewers saw. I admit I haven't read a book for enjoyment in the last 2 years because I've been involved in industry publications. I now have found time and picked this book as my first book. I've gotten about two thirds done and I find it somewhat annoying. She feels close to him because she washed his clothes, and he feels he loves her cooking, because it reminds him of mom.Maybe I haven't been around much. What is the age suggested for this book? I'm thinking maybe tweens??"
1,foul play,Not very good-not even funny! Evanovich needs stop the canned format and turn out a quality product.
2,Bad Ending!,"I was loving this quirky book until close to the end. It was witty, funny and made me laugh out loud. The characters are fun and the thought of a clown losing her job to a chicken is absurdly hilarious! All was going well and I was enjoying the book (probably would have given it a 4 star rating) until the end. The last couple of chapters really didn't fit well. Spoiler Alert**** If the rooster deal was enough to drive Amy away, why did Jake not tell her what really happened in the end? A weather girl - no way! The ending felt too rushed and out of sync with the rest of the book. Wish Evanovich could go back and end this one properly. If I knew the ending was going to be so bad, I would not have read the book and I am a HUGE Evanovich fan!"
3,"Not much substance, but it made me smile","This was just a quick listen (only 4 discs), but it was a cute little romance story, peppered with the quirky humor that Evanovich does so well in her Stephanie Plum series. It falls apart a little at the end, in an ""okay, it's time to wrap this up!"" sort of way, but it made me smile as I was listening."
5,Funny and entertaining,I love Janet Evanovich. Every book she writes is witty and makes me laugh. A good quick read that will entertain you.
2,This chicken laid an egg,Was very disappointed in this book. There seemed to be no real subject matter or substance to the story. I am a big fan of this author but this was not worth getting or reading.
4,Great Audio Book. Funny and Great Voice,"I really liked this book. It is a great romantic comedy! C.J. Critt does a great job as the reader. I would say the book should get 4 1/2 stars. The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars was because of the ending. Janet Evanovich wrapped the ending up to quickly. It seemed a little rushed. Of course, maybe I feel this way because I didn't want the story to end. I hope she writes about this couple again."
3,Fouled out,"This story was ok. I listened to it on CD. A little too sweet, but it had a mystery to offset the Harlequin sweetness. Eveything was going fine until the end, unanswered questions, what happened to the chicken freezer, does she get arrested? Why didn't Jake tell Amy that the case was solved? Why did the station manager keep quiet. I love the Plum books, but some of the others are so sweet they make my teeth ache."
4,A Wonderful Musical but Original Cast Recording is Better,"Zorba is a wonderful musical. It is just a matter of time before it receives the proper recognition. I gave this recording 4 stars because it is lacking compared to the original 1968 cast recording. The performances in the original cast by Herschel Bernardi surpass Anthony Quinn's performance. Anthony Quinn is known as Zorba, but his voice is weak for the part. Also, the original cast recording is truer to the darker side of Zorba. Zorba is a gem, but buy the original cast recording if you can find it."
3,STARRY NIGHT,"Starry Night is technically a good product but is not very user friendly in use. Limited view area due to clutter in the page layout limits the useability of the product and the screen area setting of 1024 X 768 pixels required is not very compatible with most older Windows programs. I have to change my screen settings each time I use Starry Night to get the best page layout and then change back again when I leave the program. Several of the programs provided with telescopes are better at providing a much more realistic view of the night sky for star location. Advantages of Starry Night are very current data on satellites, comets and other fleeting phonemena most of which is only visible to observers in very rural areas away from urban light pollution."
1,Not as good as Red Shift,"Not as good as the old Red Shift software from 1995. This product is cumbersome, not even a little intuitive, and lacks on screen pop-up windows to identify functions of icons. There is a lot of fluff included, but precious little substance. When I emailed the company complaining of the fact that menu items in my edition were non-functional or non-existent I received a luke warm response stating roughly... ""too bad"". The one and only nice touch is it's ability to track and present major satelites... the rest of the graphics are marginal and clutter the screen."
5,One of my favorite hardcore releases ever.,"I'm rating this as a hardcore/metalcore album and not as an overall music release of which it wouln't place ridiculously high but do not be mistaken because this is one of the most original yet overlooked bands of the genre you'll ever hear. One of the very first American hardcore bands to take the Swedish melodic death metal sound and mix it with hardcore. The result? An extremely brutal hardcore album with original melodic thrashy riffs, gnargly death growls, and a brutal foundation of booming bass and heavy drums. Not the most technical music but if you're looking for that go listen to Botch, Into The Moat, or Beneath The Massacre. If you want that old school metalcore sound before it got played out then you've found the band. I suggest picking this up now because the band has been broken up for more than four years and I'm not sure how long Life Force will keep pressing this."
5,Great Organizer for Automobile Owner's Manual!,"I purchased a new 2008 smart fortwo Passion Cabrio. It came with an owner's manual, warranty and maintenance booklets, and tire information. But there wasn't a folder or organizer to put all this stuff inside and stow it in the glove box. That's when I came across the Royce Leather Automobile Organizer (black). Not only was I able to put these items inside, but had additional room for my automobile insurance papers/proof-of-insurance card too. Plus, it came with a flashlight, pen, and tire gauge! I am very pleased with this product and recommend it for anyone who's trying to keep their glove box organized."
1,Marc Anthony's uprooted album,"There isn't a single salsa here...just a collection of ballads and other assorted Spanish pop. Even ""Ahora quien,"" which is played on the radio as a salsa, is only present here in ballad form.I don't like English pop, and I don't like Spanish pop. Anybody who feels the same should avoid this album like the plague. It's sort of sad, but from my perspective each successive album from Marc has been worse than the last. This is the worst album yet."
1,"Duh, which way did he go, George? Which way, which way???","As far as I'm concerned, everything after ""Contra La Corriente"" has been a disappointment. That CD had it all: erotic as well as sublime love lyrics. His self titled album left me stunned with how pedestrian and stupefyingly bland it was. I expected something much more sophisticated, I mean - this is Marc Anthony. I love Marc's voice and talent, and I understand he wants to try different styles but it's confusing to fans and eventually dilutes his fan base. He should stick to what he does well while learning to write music. Learning an instrument (guitar? piano? a la Alejandro Sanz) wouldn't hurt either."
1,A Cat wasting away,"Vocally Marc Anthony should be rolling instead of still trying to crack the Mainstream here as a Artist.the cat Can sing but has some of the Most cheesy material&it takes away from His growth as a Artist.""Escapemonos"" with J-Lo is a Bland track that doesn't do him any musical justice whatsoever."
3,Could Be Better,"In one word I,m Disappointed in this release Marc must have been ""PREOCUPPIED"" when he recorded this.In my opinion there are maybe 3 good songs.One that really stands out is ""AMIGO"" it is simply brillant! I,ve followed his career from the very beginning,since '92 and I know the real Marc. I hope his new salsa release lives up to the caliber that he is capable of."
1,WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????,"What is it with this CD???? did J-Ho steal his latin beat!!! where's the salsa and rithmic beats that we're used to get from marc...this might be some new era for him..but come on, you cant sell a CD with ALL 10 songs being slow!!!!"
1,Sick of the Drama!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I find the title for the cd Ironic... Okay, I am a fan of Marc Anthony, but come one, we already have enough Christians, and Luis Miguels, we do not need another. Funny but its the same over and over and over, he wines about how she left him, or she cheated on him. I kind of got tired of that three cds ago. Come up with something new Marc please. His first English cd was good, but this cd, is just a Telenovela on Cd. Wine, Wine.If you want a good Latino Flavored Cd, check out Victor Manuel, Travesia. Unlike Marc Anthonys Pop, which has already been done better by Jon Segada 10 years ago. Victor Manuel rocks, and brother has talent. Leave this cd, for the Drama Queens who like to sulk, and wine."
1,p@$$y wooped album no dancing shoes required,"If I could rate this with less than 1 star than I would , but I can't. In my opinion this is less than crappy . When I think of mark anthony I wana dance , what the hell happened to this album this seems like j-ho got to him and spoiled his latin flavor. So if you buy it, don't put it on at a party unless it's a slumber party.So instead of putting on your dancing shoes, put on your pj's or grab a hammer and smash the cd : )"
2,"I guess MARCLO is in a ""bad""llad mood","Let me start off by saying that there's nothing wrong with Marc Anthony expanding is artistic horizon. But a spanish POP cd...give me a break. On top of that, there all ballads. I waited this long for probably 2, maybe 3 decent songs. Number 1 ""ahora quien"", number 3 ""se esiuma tu amor"" and number 4 ""valio a pena"" are pretty good. Finally, people get off your high horse, there is nothing wrong with being a ""true"" Marc Anthony fan and being critical of his work."
2,Not Very Impressed,"I have to be honest. I love Marc Anthony and his ability to complete a smooth transition between English Pop Music and Latin Salsa. However, this new CD was a waste of money if you were expecting his usually AWESOME Salsa & Boleros songs. I did not like this CD and I don't think he should've even attempted to try Latin Pop. Overall, I was expecting better...."
2,Failed effort,"I awaited this release with much anticipation. All other offerings of Marc, for me have been instant successes. I have given this CD several chances and it does grow on you but If a CD doesn't grab me in the first couple of listens then I have a tendency to set it aside in favor of something else. I applaud Marc's effort and have heard him sing other things besides salsa all with great strength,maybe he had some reservations this time out which caused for a less than convincing performance in my opinion. I accept his choices for duets but I don't feel his voice meshes with Jennifer Lopez and believe this duet along with his previous one failed. I now anxiously await Marc's next try."
1,SELL OUT >> THE MOST OBVIOUS KIND OF THIS DECADE,"DON'T WASTE A CENT, PESO OR ANY DENOMINATION ON THIS ALBUM - LISTEN TO IT FOR FREE - IF YOU ARE SO COMPELLED AT RHAPSODY - GET YOUR SHORT FILL OF IT BECAUSE ANY ARTIST WHO RELEASES AN ALBUM - SIMULTANEOUSLY AS (DON'T KID YOURSELF) HIGH PROFILE RELATIONSHIP PR >>> AS WELL AS TRACKS WITH THE SAME PERSON - IT IS AN INSULT TO THE FAN BASE OF THIS ARTIST."
4,Light weight for travel,"This is a great seat. It's comfortable for our 3 year old, and lightweight & non-bulky for travel (hauling car seats can be heavy!)! It's not as plush as other seats, but we're happy with this one."
4,Baseball Digest,"This subscription is a renewal from last year for my 11 year old grandson. He is very active in sports, especially baseball. He says he loves the magazine and has every issue from last year so I renewed again just a few weeks ago. I am very pleased he is so involved in the magazine. He is an avid reader. I am not quite so pleased with the price. It is only 5 to 6 magazines per year for close to $40."
3,Callas is NOT Amina,"The greatest singing actress of all time is NOT Amina. But she must be given credit for paving the road for the greatest coloratura soprano of all time, Dame Joan Sutherland. Just as Callas was the theatrical sensation of the operatic world, Sutherland was the vocal wonder of the operatic role. We are indeed fortunate to have so many recordings of the two most important opera singers of this and any other century. Callas IS Tosca, Violetta, Leonora, Butterfly, and Medea. Sutherland IS Amina, Norma, Lucia, Semiramide and Elvira."
5,"Very informative, to the point, we'll follow the advise","As a realtor investor, I was impressed by the forthright information given in this publication. No double talk, no come on's just simple straight talk. I'd advise any home buyer looking to save money, to buy this book."
3,Lacking,"The original edition included photographs for some reason these were deleted with later editions,I re-ordered through Amazon and received the edition I was seeking {and recall from long ago}This edition I gave away as I do not settle for second best."
5,Trailer hauler,"The wishbone is great the hitch pin is okay. The Pad lock is tiny not wide enough to lock a standard 2""5/16 ball. I have two trailer that i tried to use this on. It is a nice lock for other things though."
4,"Great Visuals, but not a story book","This is a book about Mythology and shows lots of visuals of ancient art showing how they depicted their mythology. It's organised by types of mythology, creation myths, fertility myths, afterlife myths, not by cultures. It's a broad introduction to the topic, and I know kids will find the pictures interesting and they will want to learn more about the specifics, which will require other books, but for a child first begining to understand mythology, or even the roots of NeoPaganism, this and perhapse the DK eyewitness book on religion would be a great start. The best part, in my opinion, is that it even encludes a few Biblical myths. ;) As far as age range goes, I think it would be good for 8-14 ish, but child millage and maturity will vary."
4,Great for Children of All Ages,"There are many great books about mythology, but you will be hard pressed to find one that presents the material as engagingly as this picture book. The rise of film as the principal mode of communication in Modern culture attests to the fact that it is still true to say that 'One picture is worth a thousand words.' Hopefully the novice reader of mythology, for whom the book was largely designed, will be entertained, fascinated, and stimulated to go on to more mature studies of this life enhancing subject. What more could one ask for?Since it's now December this would make a great gift for someone with a fledgling interest in the world of the Imagination."
5,Durable product,"I purchased 2 of these bowls hoping they would fit in my PUGS raised feeder, unfortunately they did not. However, this is a fantastic item and hopefully they will make these with receding undersides that will fit someday. They, of course, are easy to wash and keep clean and will not break as the ceramic ones I have do often."
2,Will look for studio version,"The songs are great, the harmonies outstanding. Problem with this an all live recordings is the requirement to endure the applause and the end of each number. For me it ruins the texture and flow."
1,"A GREAT FIND FOR ALL FANS OF TOMITA,but why extortionatly expesive??","A GReat find for all tomita Fans, BUT IF ICAN'T SAMPLE THE SOUND (s) OF IT, HOW CAN I KNOW IF $243.00 IS WORTH SPENDING, EVEN ON A BOX-SET!! IF, I COULD HEAR SOME SAMPLES (AS I AM CRAZY FOR HIS DVD's, (HIS WORK) i'd be more likely to Buy IT!!!!!!! MR JASON rODGERS."
3,Decent little blower,"Ive had this model for four years and it's still going strong. I was surprised after storing it for a year when it started with one or two pulls. The power is what kept me from rating it any higher. Its great for driveways and light debris but it lacks the real power neccesary to move anything wet. Recently I bought a Stihl BR600, but still use this one for quick clean ups. After each use, I clean the machine and disassemble it. I think that is the reason it's lasted me so long."
2,Husqvarna 125BT Blower,"I've purchased this 125BT blower in MAR 2007, so now its 4 yrs old & it needs a new carburator according to the Husqvarna dealer. The problem is that I paid $175.00 for this junk blower & the new carburator costs $110.00 installed.So in 4 yrs. it went bad. Here's the kicker, it was used only in the fall so maybe 10 hrs/year.DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL, you'll be sorry you did.Wally"
4,Made me feel better,"Wow, what a roller coaster this woman's been on!I too have a teen age daughter, and it is not an easy row to hoe. I think if people could look into the future to actually experience their darling little toddlers as teens, they'd think twice about parenthood.That said, her daughter was what I would call a Worst Case Scenario.I felt for her and what she went through, and I refrain from judging where she ""went wrong,"" as I am now reaping what I no doubt helped to sow with my female teen.One thing this book, along with ""Hold Me Close, Let Me Go"" did, was give me something so that I can think ""Well, it hasn't gotten THAT bad.""Hope it doesn't. God help us all with teenagers! God, please help."
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah","This memoir was painful. Painful in a ""oh my God, could it get any worse?"".Boring, mundane, cold, flatlined. It feels as though the author is emotionless and it got to a point where I just felt like shaking her and saying ""oh enough already"".Sincerely, just pass this one buy. Not even worth a library visit."
2,Poor Me!,"I heard the author on NPR and thought that she had something worthwhile to say. Her story is worth hearing but her feelings of responsibility, or lack of feelings of responsibility, are hard to believe. It is acceptable for parents to blame anyone but themselves and parents who hold this philosophy will relate to this book. It would be interesting if the daughter now wrote this story from her point of view."
2,"Good Writing, Bad Parenting","When Martha Tod Dudman was a teen-ager in the Sixties she took drugs, had sex, stole cars, and got kicked out of school. In the Nineties her 15-year-old daughter, Augusta, takes drugs, has sex, steals cars and runs away from school. Gee, go figure. This gracefully written book takes you on a self-centered trip through Martha's incompetent parenting. The only times you are not frustrated with this moronic mother is when she describes her escapist treks up and down the mountains of Maine. She has no control over Augusta but she does little to assert control either. Beyond the talented writing there is little to recommend this book."
2,"Sorry, No Thanks","There are many interesting memoirs out there...I did not enjoy this book. This might be of use for people that have problem children, but no thanks."
1,Not the honest truth you may be searching for!,"Author is a fine writer but is not completely true with self. She seems to just arrive at this ""place"" where both her teens have become ""screwed up by the system."" She has a non realistic view of teachers and a profound biased opinion of them. This is unfair and unfortunate for her and her children. As a caring teacher who has worked with many non traditional and ""difficult"" students I found this left a negative impression on me. It is always a ""why me"" attitude that also bothered me through out this book."
5,So good,"My brother actually went to the same school she went to, witch is actually really different than described in the book, but it's so so good! And so is the movie."
4,Interesting,I remember watching this movie on tv. I really enjoyed reading the book. Helped me to understand my own family member's addiction.
4,Bathory is the root of Black Metal,"Other Black / Death Metal bands from the early eighties already had a tribute. And now Bathory is as well rewarded by this great production.Bathory created a whole scene, now inspired by it's raw and evil music. The bands on this tribute reminds us it well. I think any Black Metal fan should be aware of Bathory's contribution to metal.I was not in Black Metal when these albums came out. But now, as a Black Metal fan and musician, I feel Bathory is something you must have in your collection because this is the root of Black Metal. And roots are what makes you stand still and not fall.At last, and to leave a word on the CD itself, I was pleased to hear these songs with a new sound and a good production. The performers are so good (Emperor, Marduk, Dark Funeral, Satyricon...) and the songs are among Bathory's best.A must have for any Bathory fan!"
3,A review,I was a little surprised that I could still acquire such an item in almost new condition. I am pleased of the product and it arrived fairly quickly. The outside cover had some ware but aside from that every thing is fine. I look forward to an futre bussiness.
4,Stephen Sondheim a Bit Strange Musical,"I listened to these CD's and although I had a bit of a problem following them at first, I did enjoy several parts. Reading along with the CD's did help. Sondheim does not write and produce what I consider the ""usual"" musical, but it was something to enjoy after I was able to understand what he was trying to get across. My favorite parts were those done by Julie Andrews. Her drama adds much to this work."
2,What a Letdown,"As a huge dada fan since Puzzle (AHF is my favorite), I hurried in to get each new release, ready to revel in the ultra-talented trio's next musical smorgasbord of musical delicacies. This disc left me hungry, though. Uninspired, bland, mediocre songs that KINDA sounded like dada, but it was missing something. My guess is that they were doing their first record for MCA, and MCA made them use a different producer (Danny Kortchmar), one that knew nothing about dada'a sound, and he managed to let them make a crappy, haphazard album that doesn't hold a candle to their previous 3 CDs. No wonder they broke up soon thereafter and never made another record."
5,Great CD,This is my favorite Dada album. I come back to it over and over. It covers a lot of territory musically and is just great. I hope the band can get back together and make more like this one!
5,Best Yet,"These guys just keep getting better and better. Their songwriting and harmonies are totally solid, the production is great, and the album is sonically top-notch (thanks to Mr. Clearmountain, Mr. Lord-Alge, and Mr. Ludwig). This is a must have."
3,Fitzgerald Fans Should Read,"Didn't quite finish it, although it was a well-written, interesting book. His Hollywood years were so unhappy, one felt a bit mired down as the chapters progressed. There are some great anecdotes."
3,Pleasant sax and piano duets,"Diplomatie is an album of sax and piano duets and contains some beautiful and laid back music. Theres nothing earth shattering or groundbreaking on Diplomatie, just pleasant, relaxing and generally creative music. Unfortunately on occasion some of this strays a little too close to Kenny G(od awful) and/or smooth jazz territory for my tastes, but that happens rarely. A few warhorses, Round Midnight, Donna Lee and Night Train are trotted out and led around the paddock to good effect. This album is really nothing if not pleasant. Its good for background music or simply to relax to after a long day. Occasionally a little fire is lit, but not often, this is set at simmer, not boil."
4,A terrific read!,"The action begins on the first page and keeps up the momentum until the final page. The characters come alive, and the author's descriptions of people and places, enable the reader to almost be there. I loved the heroine, very much a woman of our times, and I must confess to a sneaking liking of 'Mohan' (one of those involved in shady dealings). I hope that the author will write a follow up to the Panama Affair as I would love to know what happened to him! This book would make a great film!"
4,one of the best in its genre,the panama affair was one of the best thrillers i have had the pleasure of reading.Irank it up there with the firm and all the presidents men.
3,surf music that is vague,these cds are fair. there are some by artists that are unfamiliar. it is alright for a couple of listenings. after that just file it under forgetful.
5,Idiots,"To break it to all you Idiots, I got this cd about the time it came out around 2006. And if it wasn't for industry types and quote un quote hipsters, rappers would not be nearly as large as they are now, I'm sorry but ""the hood"" can not simply buy enough records to float support write about and give every new hip hop artist a career, thus this album being as old as it is now was way ahead of its time, that a genre and culture of musicians not only accepted Kanye for the artist he was but wanted to showcase him in a different light that helped bring new audiences and new creativity to his lyricism is something that rarely happens. This is a fun album, and I am so happy it is still around, If your THAT DIE HARD of a Kanye fan to where this pisses you off then I suggest you look at other music because you clearly know nothing about it."
3,The original KW album was so awful that this coudn't possibly be good.,"If you bought this thinking it was the Kanye West album, then...learn to read. I was in one of the bands that made a track for this record. We tried to make a decent song out of the track we picked to cover, but the original was so bad that we had to mock it rather than trying to make it ""good"". The lyrics were horrible for the song too. Something about racism and needing ID to get into Sam's Club. Something about being baptized a couple times a day. Just bad. This record is good for a laugh, but beyond that you're stretching it."
1,This Isnt Kanye WEST at all,"Dont be fooled by the title at all , this cd has nothing to do with Kanye West in fact he may be taking legal action aginst these artist for using his name. In this album some random kids attempt to redo some of Kanye's songs with a terrible result. Dont buy this cd These artist are clearly using Kanye's Name to put out this horrible music."
1,false advertising,"I've waited years for MST3000 to have a closed-captioned release. Finally, there's this one... which clearly states here that this DVD IS closed captioned.It's not. It was a waste of $20 for me."
3,It was OK,i LOVE mst3000 HOWEVER the Essentials are not so essential! There are a few good laughs in there but its not worth the price. Shorts vol.1 is fantastic.
1,its ok,"Great if you haven't seen them before, not really a repeater. There's parts that are way too long stretches of actually watching the videos. I think that there's plenty better in other releases."
3,DVD,The show is still funny BUT - I prefer the orignial cast and crew and would not pay over $10.00 ( shipping included ) for this DVD.
2,Not the essentials at all,This is a good dvd to have but has nothing worth re-watching. They really don't show off the MST3K wit in these two movies.
1,I can't stand this show.,"Ok, there are alot of bad movies out there. SO what, this features lame comments about bad movies. and sometimes even good ones. This is one of the lamest shows ever. I lvoe low budget sci fi and this takes the attitude that there idiotic comments are so smart. Not in the least. ok, fans will say ,that the cheesy lameness is a mirror of the films , but I don't agree with that. however the two movies featured here are two of the worst movies ever. SO now not only do you get that but the show I can't stand on top of it."
5,Perfect for Joel fans...,"What can I say, the two shows on this dvd are what MST3K is all about. NO disappointments here..."
4,MST3K: The Essentials,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 is classic. For those who never saw the series when it originally aired, get ready for a boatload of belly-laughs. Take some of the cheesiest films ever made in the 1950's and 60's. add three robots, two over-the-top evil scientists, and a poor air-headed janitor named Joel, and you've got comedy gold. Joel and the 'bots watch these amazingly bad films and talk back to the screen, saying everything you're thinking and much, much more. You HAVE to see this!"
4,Manos and Santa Claus Conquers the Martions,"These Movies Rock! Or at least the comentary does... I would advise any lover of MST3K to add this to his collection. Anyone who was there for the airings of these episodes can truely never forget the guy in the polar bear ""custume"" in S.C.C.M.; or the extermly large knees on Torgo in Manos. Without Joel, Crow or Tom Servo of course, these movies would all stink. Santa Claus Conquers the Martions is basicaly a movie about gigantic green honey nut cherrios honey bees who kidnap Santa and take him to Mars in hopes that the kids of Mars will be able to learn the true meaning of fun. Then we have Manos the Hands of Fate (or feet if you prefer), a movie made up partly of nightgown wrestling, the view a of a field passing quickly from a car window and occasionaly some wise words from the hero Torgo. ""The master would not approve..."" Torgo might be heard to say of this review. In closing, BUY THIS DVD SET!!!!!!(or don't)"
3,kinda disappointed,"I like the Santa Claus one, it was not as good as Puma Man, but was at least worth watching. The Hands of fate was a considerable disappointment. The movie was so unbelievably bad that nothing could redeem it."
3,Halfway To Happy.,"Santa Vs The MartiansManos, The Hand of FatePoopie, the Official MST3K Outtake Reel.All of these are really funny. Especially the Santa one.But I already paid about 20 bucks for the other two in video casset, about six months ago. So I feel pretty cheated right now.RHINO: DON'T MIX OLD PREVIOUSLY RELEASED EPISODES WITH NEW ONES. IT'S NOT FAIR. ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T LABEL THE BLASTED COVER!So yeah, a must have if you haven't seen Poopie and Manos."
3,Did NOT include shorts - volume 3,"We purchased The Essentials because the insert in the Series 9 said that it included 2 movies plus the shorts which we love. Some reviewers said they received the shorts, others did not. Add us to the did not."
2,Really not the best of MST,"I paid for this one based on my love of the show but this one really isn't their best- by far. Not as many jokes as the show usually had & the jokes that are there just aren't that funny. Even the movies aren't that entertaining (cheesewise I mean). There are better episodes you can purchase out here. I'd go with just about any of them before this one. Still love the show, but in this case they really missed the mark on funny."
3,"Flimsy pages not suitable for ""Little Fingers""","I bought two of the very early piano books from Thompsons. Don't they realize that small children want to leaf through these books again and again and that the flimsy pages are not suitable for ""Little Fingers""? I think I will end up gluing the pages on card board and putting them into a three-ring binder."
4,easy to learn,"easy to learn! My daughter is still too young to read these books on her own, but we play the songs from the book together and it's fairly easy to learn even if you've never played the piano before."
5,Beginning to play the piano,I was delighted with the updates in this book from the original that I used when I was a kid and had also used to teach my own son and ordered this one to teach my granddaughter. I loved the addition of new colors and pictures and the availability of music to accompany the new learner. I'm so glad this classic is still available and it came fast enough for me to use before my little visitor left.
3,"Songs Only, No Theory","Teaching Little Fingers is advertised as ""your child's first music book,"" but it is basically just a songbook. There is a little blurb about each song's character, but there is no explanation of note names or rhythmic values.Most of the songs are in Middle-C position, although a variety of positions in C-Major are explored.Teaching Little Fingers to Play ENSEMBLE contains corresponding accompaniments.Overall, I think Teaching Little Fingers is a very good SUPPLEMENT to your primary curriculum. For this age group, I recommend Alfred's Music for Little Mozarts course.If this is your first introduction to piano, Teaching Little Fingers is NOT the book for you. In this case, see my review of the Little Mozarts Lesson Book I."
2,butterfingers,I was disappointed in this book. The cover says 'a book for the earliest beginner'. Well that is me. But I found this book confusing. The artwork is nice and the book could be helpful if you know a little about music. But the nitty gritty of how to use your fingers to play the songs is not done well I feel. I got a book out of the library and that helped. And then this book made a little more sense. But I wouldn't recommend it for a real beginner.
4,Just Right,My daughter loves the illustrations and the simple songs. She was able to play a song after her first lesson. Very cool.
2,disappointed in songs,was very disappointed in the song selections...my daughter is 9 and she knew 2 songs....i only knew a handful.....sent back
3,NOT for the earliest beginners,"Despite what the title says, ""A Book For The Earliest Beginner"", I feel that it's not for the kids younger than 6 or 7. Requiring to read the music notes on the lines right from the beginning is too much for the kids who barely know alphabets. This book could be fine for older kids or for supplementing other courses. Try Alfred's books which I found much easier and gradual on very young children. If they are under 5, you could try Alfred's Prep Course."
3,Wishing for more...,"I bought this book a few months ago based on the Amazon reviews, so I felt compelled to review it myself. This book, while full of wonderful pictures, isn't the best book for a child younger than six or seven. It doesn't teach how to read music, and instead creates its own alternative method for reading music, which has not held my younger students' attention. Unfurtunately, it doesn't provide enough instruction geared towards that age group. I will keep this book on the shelf and try again with older beginning students."
3,Atruggling a bit with this!,"I got this book for my 5uear old and I to use with his keyboard.I'm not particularly musical, I have to read the instructions a couple of times to understand it myself before I try and teach him!I shall persevere but there may be a book that would be easier for me to use!"
3,Better for people with a piano background,"If you play piano, and are trying to teach your child to play piano, this book is probably great. But if you dont' have a keyboard background, it's easy to get lost early on."
5,Great first book,"I am going to teach my daughter, 10 how to play. This is an ideal first book. All basics covered"
4,eggcrate review,"Eggcrate works well, is not annoying to sit on and serves it,s purpose. The only thing I would suggest to improve it would be to make it a little thicker."
5,Mother Lode,"""Mother Lode"" is one of those island picks for me. It's the onlyL&M; album I ever bought and I've listened to it hundreds of times.It always sounds fresh and it was a delight to finally find a re-masteredversion that makes a well-engineered album sound that much better."
5,One of the better antidotes to the right-wing colonisation of the intellect,"In the midst of the noisy and empty-headed celebrations of bourgeois values and free-market economics currently echoing around shady right-wing think-tanks and obsequious university departments, Meiksins Wood provides us with a salutory reminder that freedom in the context of the capitalist market is an illusion. We are in fact free to do only - and precisely - what the market demands. This potted history of the rise of a market dependency that is anything but an inevitable product of fixed human nature or evolutionary progress, followed up skilfully in her sequel 'Empire of Capital', is splendidly written in a clear, breezy style that the lay person should have no trouble following. In an intellectual world currently saturated with stale and repetitive free-market mumbo-jumbo, Meiksins Wood reminds us that some of us are still capable of mobilising critical intelligence."
5,BUD Posh Piggy Bank,The item actually came in earlier than expected. The Piggy Bank was in good shape and was packaged well. Thank you!
3,"GREAT ALBUMS...BUT NOT A ""HEADPHONES"" ALBUM","no center on this album; the sax (very loud) and piano are on the left, drums and bass on the right. if you;re listening with headphones it is very annoying."
4,A recording for Gencer lovers,It is pitty that Leyla Gencer did not record for the commercial recording companies. May be Elisabetta is not one of her greatest roles but you feel her power in all the lines.
4,Best companion in a work bench as refence,Provide you the basic measurement technique. Topics are discussed clearly and followed by block diagrams for easy understanding
2,Too advanced for Newbie,"I have a BS in electronics technology. I know alot about digital electronics, but RF frequency is something I know little about. This book is definitely not meant for a beginner to the RF world. I am totally lost."
3,So-so,"Not as bad as some of the reviewers described it, but not as good as the 1971 live album with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, this album suffer from ups and downs. Weak perfomances of ""Whiter shade of pale"", ""Homburg"" and ""Pandora's box"" (shame on James Gallway)- the originals of the three are in the highest level of rock music and it was a big mistake to try to change them. ""Grand Hotel"" (that is sung by James Hedley) is good, and so are ""Conquistador"", ""Simple sister"" (with Tom Jones) ""Don't look back"" and ""Butterfly boys"". The rest are so-so. I agree with Mattias, that the 1971 live album is much better, but ""Simple sister"" is not that bad."
1,NOT a good album,"This album is very weak! The production and the arrangements are not nice at all. Check out ""Live with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra"" instead. That's a nice one. Please, don't waste your money on this one."
5,Where has this been all my life??,I absolutely LOVE this item! I need to get a couple more! It is so easy and convenient to use as long as you don't need to put a lid on the pot in which you are cooking.
3,Helping Hand,"I was a wee bit disappoin&#8203;ted with the size, but it works, nonetheless. Glad I got it, because my husband and son are always putting the dirty spoon on the counter and never clean up after themselves."
4,Good little gadget,"I bought these as stocking stuffers because they are good to have. My sister saw me using it and thought is was useful, needless to say she found on in her stocking"
2,The spoon keeps slipping out,"Does not work well. The spoon keeps slipping out and secondly, can't close the lid in the pot when this is clipped to the edge."
3,Good for only a specific size spoon,"This is a cleaver idea marred by a design which allows for only a certain type of spoon handle: it must be round and not too thick. Unfortunately I have a number of spoons and spatulas which don't fit into this device, making it of limited use."
5,Amazing,This little gadget is the best thing to come on the market since widgets. It doesn't look like much but the spoon fits easily in it and all the drippings fall right back in the pot rather than on a spoon holder on the stove. For anything without lids it is amazing.
2,Trudeau Pot Clip Spoon Rest,"Made well but, awkward to use. I would not purchase it again. Went back to using a small dish I purchased (at a yard) sale as a spoon rest. Cost? .25 Go figure..."
5,Great little gadget,"This is a cool and practical little gadget. Great if your dish requires a lot of stirring - soups, sauces, risotto, etc. No more messy spoon rests or counter tops.I keep mine clipped to the side of my utensil pot for easy access.I've also used it to hold recipes and hang it from my cabinet door handle for easy and hands free recipe reading!"
4,Great Value,"Very long battery life. This is great if you need focused light in a dark setting. Center of the light beam is bright, but the rest of it is weak. Not that visible outside in the bright sun, but great at night and it dark lighting. I own two of these. The light is bright but does not go far. Great flashlight none the less. great value."
4,A good hands on teaching tool,"As a teacher in a four blocks classroom, I was ""strongly encouraged"" to use this text. It was not until I used the third grade edition last year that I saw how well it worked. This year, I am back in grade one and have an incredibly sharp group of students. They want to keep making words once the lesson is done! I only wish the third graders I taught last year had been fortunate enough to have had this concept when they were in first grade."
1,Rather odd book for a child,"I purchased this book because my daughter, adopted internationally, was given a name at birth which refers to the moon. We have many ""moon"" books for bedtime. Unfortunately, this book is not so soothing, and relies rather heavily on a Christian theme, which is not what I was expecting from teh title. The child is going to bed and sees the moon, but on the next page suddenly she's ""alone in a boat at sea, won't anyone rescue me."" Happily, she is brought safely ashore by God. The pictures are lovely, but the story just takes an odd turn early on and may not be quite what one expects from the title."
5,Wall of Death is superb.,"A great song by the awesome Richard Thompson, R.E.M. covers it better than the master himself. Highly recommended, even for just the one song."
1,Sizing problem,"I had to buy several sizes to try to get one that fit. They put a stick in the shoes that stretches the shoes over time and alters the size. The 10.5 was too small and the 11 was too large. I initially bought the 11., which is the size of all of my other shoes, and that was way too large. I ended up returning everything and buying nothing."
3,Seem well made but very stiff,"Having had a pair of Hushpuppies mocassin-type slippers for years (they are still servicable), I felt the need to get something else. I purchased a cheap pair of Dockers slippers which fell apart after 6-months, so I decided to try something more substantial. These are ""substantial"" but not the most comfortable right out of the box. I wouldn't consider wearing them without socks, but the brown dye stains my socks. I'm hoping that after a break-in period, they'll get what I'm looking for and last a long time."
3,size issue,"I wear a size 9.5 shoe. I ordered a 9.5 and it was at least an inch too long and wide. I sent it back, paying the shipping. I re-ordered a size 9. My toes is tight up against the end of the shoe. it is stretching a bit but my toe will eventually wear through the end of the shoe. Please instruct whoever is making these mocs to pay more attention to sizing.Also, in the picture, the moc is smooth leather. When it arrived, it was suede. it was listed as suede, but i went by the picture."
3,To sparce a discription.,"Descriptions on many products, even those with specs, (not all, and not just shoes) are lacking important detaials. These are not comfortable to walk around wearing as a substitute for say deck shoes. The main problem being they do not have an arch support. Without an arch support, it gets tedious to continually wear them. Such information should be supplied in the description/specs of shoes. The leather uppers are great, the sole should last a long time, but they are not comfortable for extended wear. Oh yeah, my cats think the shoes are great for sharpening their claws."
4,Balushi,"This shoe is comfortable to a certain extent, and the problem is only it is little bit narrow from the side, it is good for skinny feet and not for wide feet. However, in general this is a good shoe."
2,Coming apart,"I wore them less than a week and the stitching started to come loose. I had to take them to a cobbler (yes we still have one here in the hinterlands) to get them fixed.Pass, next time"
2,Bad,"I am really mad about this CD. I got this CD at the library and burned but it feels like I've been ripped off. Jimi Hendrix, who is and has always been one of my favorite guitarists, would be extremely pissed about this release. There is no passion or feelings in the songs (with the exeption of Bold As Love). The songs needed to be full of feeling, just the way Jimi wrote them. There are only three good songs; Bold as Love by Steve Vai and others, Wind Cries Mary by Sting and others, and Spanish Castle Magic by Santana and others. The other songs are terrible renditions of the Guitar God's best songs. Oh well, what are you gonna do."
2,Curtis J. George was right,"I Purchased this album for school to write a paper about justifying an evaluation. This CD is horrible! I can't even believe i spent the 17 dollars to buy this. The orchestral accompaniment is totally misused and drones out any reminense of what i would call rock and roll. The only song on the CD i would ever listen to again is Bold as love. In fact, Bold As Love is the only reason i gave the CD two stars instead of one. It is almost like the origional song. Other than that, the entire CD was a waist. Don't buy this. Instead buy some classic hendrix, like ""Experience Hendrix: The Best Of Hendrix."" That is a great album. But as for ""In From The Storm""? I think i'll put that with all of my AOL trial CD's. Hope this was helpful.Steggy"
2,Hmm...,"The first reviewer pretty much said it all. Carlos Santana, Robben Ford, Brian May, Taj and whoever else is on here are very good guitarists, but they get buried beneath the orchestration and in some cases get devoured by the tunes themselves.John McLaughlin, on the other hand, does not. His version of ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is timeless. It's what ever cover ought to aspire to (what Jimi did to ""All Along the Watchtower"" and ""Hey Joe"") - he takes the original song, and through his own vision and personality, pushes it farther. His solo is simply phenomenal. Just the sound he gets from that guitar is a killer, sort of After the Rain (his 1995 Coltrain Tribute album) plus distortion. It really sounds wicked. In sort of a winsome tribute, he goes nuts on the vibrato bar at the end of the song.So, should you buy it? I think you might as well - if anything just for Johnny Mac. Those used copies are going pretty cheap."
5,The Ultimate Collection!,"Gary Wright was born in New Jersey, but he started recording in 1967 and then moved on to work with ""Spooky Tooth"". In 1970 he was one of many upcoming talents that helped with George Harrison's keyboards on his famous 3-LP, ""All Things Must Pass"". Now this collection gathers the best from his studio recordings from 1971 to 1998. Its mostly a seventies sound with blockbusters like, Love Is Alive"" and ""Dreamweaver"", but other songs like ""Touch And Gone"" are thrillers. Along with those, he manages some good heart-breaking ballads, such as, ""Someone Like You"". The songwriting, instrumentals and vocals are all top notch and this is really the best collection available with great liner notes."
5,Totally Awesome!,"I was surprised by all the great music that was on this cd from the track ""get on the right road"" to the last track ""if you believe in heaven"" I never realized Gary Wright recorded anything but ""dream weaver""since little has been said til now!"
4,Pretty good,"good, healthy, and well-priced when you buy in bulk. found that I prefer the white cheddar version better, though."
3,"Easy, Could Use More Flavor","I actually prefer the taste of the Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese, which is not instant, but has more flavor. The kids are eating this, though, which is a good sign. It is effortless with convenient packaging."
5,Awesome,The only better macaroni (besides homeade) is the annie's organic and the ones with cheese sauce.
3,pretty ok...,"this isn't too, too bad but it's not great either. i have to cook the noodles longer than the directions say and i have to add water. i almost always have an overflow problem thereafter. the taste is not bad, although with just water, it's pretty, well, watery. still, it is relatively ""instant"" and ""easy."""
1,Terrible service!,"I was told that this item was ""undeliverable"". Funny since I received 3 other packages from same seller, via same shipping company! The new shipping company that amazon uses is Terrible!!!"
4,pretty good for a quick meal,These are very easy to prepare with a microwave. I like how the portions are small. Every other package of mac and cheese is for a family. These are individual servings. No butter or milk is required.
2,I'll stick with the conventional cooking method......,"Have enjoyed Annie's White Mac & Cheese very much, but this microwavable variety is more trouble than its worth. You must use a very deep & wide bowl to use in the microwave or the water will boil over and you'll be left with very hot, uncooked macaroni in the bowl and a starchy mess in the microwave. It is much easier to make the conventional variety in a pot!"
1,"Without a doubt, the WORST mac-n-cheese I have ever tasted.","I bought the Annies Homegrown Microwaveable Mac-n-cheese. Actually my wife bought it because it is so-called ""healthy"". It was hands down the worst macncheese I have ever tasted, and after trying it, I would be loathe to try any more Annies products. It had a nasty plastic-like aftertaste, I had to rinse my mouth out.I am throwing away the remaining 4 packets because I would not feed the crap to my cat! This is a definite DON'T BUY IT!"
5,Yum,"Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese makes a quick and easy side dish with dinner. No fuss, no muss. Good for a snack, too"
1,Gross,"The cheese powder tasted gross. Also, when made according to instructions, the sauce was too watery. The pasta tasted grainy and mushy at the same time."
4,Not as good as the white cheddar!,"This is an easy lunch for a vegetarian, but the cheese flavor is better with the white cheddar variety. Also, it says to use 1/2 cup of water, and it really needs about 1 cup if you even want half a chance of stirring the powdered cheese into the noodles, it is way too dry without more water. I've started eating Annie's instead of Velveeta, which I used to eat regularly, because of the organic noodles."
3,THE NAME IT AND CLAIM IT GAME,THIS WAS AN OLDER COPY FROM THE 1990S AND IT WAS INFORMATIVE AND I LEARNED A GREAT DEAL BUT THE NEWER ADDITION IS SURELY MUCH BETTER AS THE COST IS IN THE 100S WITH VIEDEO AND AUDIOAND THE NEW BOOK THAT HAS BEEN REPUBLISHED.I GAVE THIS BOOK 3 STARS.
1,This book is a joke,"I Paid $41.00 for this book. When I received the book, notice the price on the book was $9.95 what a rip off. After reading the book I felt this has to be a joke. It is poorly written and the book is about her family. I don't think it is worth the money."
4,Very soulful folk singer,"Martin Sexton is a great vocalist, very soulful, and a talented songwriter. I love this album; it is simple and unadorned, but you don't need a lot of over production when you have this kind of talent. Particularly fun is the song ""Diner"" which was featured on ""Scrubs"" as a dance montage.Highly recommended."
5,The kind of album that keeps growing on you,"When I first listened to this album, I loved Glory Bound and that was all I listened to, I thought the other songs were either not so impressive or a bit silly. But you know how some of your all time favorite albums took you a while to ""get"" and love? Black Sheep is like that, the more you listen the more you love. You'll look back (like I do) and wonder why you didn't ""hear"" these songs at first like you do now."
5,wow,"This is the best of the Sexton CDs - the others have, unfortunately, been overproduced. Those who have seen him live will wonder why he is singing with a blanket over his head on the Atlantic records; everthing which is held back on the albums is released in person. The producers of 'Black Sheep' were good enough to flesh out the songs acoustically with light backup and smart enough to let the voice go (....) I don't have the quote from the jacket of 'Black Sheep' handy, but it hits it right on the head.As to why Sexton isn't immensely famous: he can't be pigeonhold & thus is difficult to mass market. I don't know anyone who has listened to his music who is not now a fan, and, as attested above, his concerts are a truly joyous experience."
5,Amazing!,"Martin Sexton is a musical genius. His mixture of his acoustic guitar and his soulful voice are sure to give goose bumps to the listener. Black Sheep is one of his earlier albums, but by far the best. Songs like ""Black Sheep,"" and ""Can't Stop Thinking `Bout You"" are examples of his soul, and ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" epitomizes his heartfelt approach to music. I absolutely love this CD and recommend it to any music lover. Although seeing Marty live is blissful, Black Sheep comes close to being right there with him."
5,Martin is my Jesus Christ,"The only thing better than a Martin Sexton album is a Martin Sexton live show. When I first purchased this album, it did not leave my CD player for 2 weeks. I first heard Martin in my friends car, and became hooked from hearing ""Diner"" once. What is fantastically fortunate for me is that Martin visits Minneapolis frequently, so I never have to go too long to hear him live. In the time lapses in between, this is the album that keeps me from going into withdraw. ""Where did I go wrong with you"" can literally bring me to tears if I am in the right frame of mind. Black Sheep is any person's Martin collection staple."
5,Best new folk artist of our generation.,This album is full of passion and intelligent songwriting. Martin Sexton firmly establishes himself as a key player in folk music today.
3,Sketcher Punisher,This product lives up to it's name where your feet are concerned. I own other Sketcher types but this one is tough on the old dogs.
4,Quite the metal CD,"Skip the first track and continue listening, if you want to hear some quality instrumental metal guitar playing this is the album for you. The songs are nicely laid out and not over done, well thought out also. I would recomend to anyone"
4,Decent,"I agree that the compositions and playing aren't very original, but for anyone curious to hear something a little different it's worth a spin or two. Alot of it is laid back and classical sounding (European musicians are always heavily influenced by classical music) I would have like to hear a little more agressiveness- the cd may be called metal guitar but you won't find much metal here. Overall it's not bad for a somewhat amateur level, but for a real take on European metal guitar try Children of Bodom, Symphony X, In Flames or Soilwork. Those wanting to hear more of a shred type album I suggest anything by Joe Stump, Michael Angelo Batio, or Rusty Cooley."
2,Don't let the fine picture and name fool you!,"When I was in the music store I was looking for something new to buy, something that I have never even heard of, so I saw this Cd that had a pretty intriguing cover and a very temptative name so I decided to buy it. For my surprise, It's guitar work was very poor, lacking of technique and originality. The album doesn't have anything that you haven't ever heard of, except for one thing. It has a version of the ""winter movement"" by Vivaldi played on electric guitar which I thought was pretty interesting, although its production is very poor and the texture of the sound leaves a lot to be desired. Other than that the album is practically unhearable due to the unprofessionalism of the performers and lack of production."
3,Holmes Smoke Grabber,"This smokeless ashtray works very well. The problem is that the tray itself isn't easy to remove and thus it is a chore to have to change the batteries, which, by the way, do need fairly frequent changing. However, the mechanism itself works well."
2,doesn't last,"This worked great for a few weeks, then just after it was too late to return it, It Quit...... It's bulky and requires D size batteries, which if you use it a couple hours a day isn't bad, but a couple of full days in the office and you'll be needing new batteries."
1,don't waste your money,"At least I didn't waste too much money. But this product is lacking. To begin with, it absolutely eats batteries. It requires 2 D batteries, which needed to be replaced after the first 10 days. You have to keep the cigarette directly under the lid for it to absorb the smoke otherwise it just floats past the fan. The lid will not stay in place, which is what activates the fan and there are times the fan has not even worked until I put something heavy on the tray to hold it down. Don't waste your money on this thing."
3,smokeless ashtray,"My most recent purchase of these ashtrays has shown them to be a small disappointment. They aren't the quality they were in the past. They still do everything they were intended to do, but they are not as quiet as the previous purchases in the past. I actually sent the recent purchase back and the replacements are the same. I originally bought them because they were supposed to be quieter than others. I don't know if they are, but I know they aren't as quiet as the ones I purchased 3 years ago."
5,Great Item with a little ingeniuity,"I think I already did a review but will add. For my purpose which is occasional smoking in the house it works great. I have added a few steps to keep smoking smell at -0-. When I smoke I use a small glass coaster that I remove and wash so the actual ashtray is not scarred keeping it looking new. After the first few uses I noticed that when I opened it had that stale smoke smell even with not using the ashtray itself, so I had a cat-food lid (plastic) and put baking soda in the lid and when not in use the baking soda takes care of any residual smell. So far it it working perfectly. As said I ususally do not smoke in the house so these extra steps to keep it really ""clean"" smelling are no big deal and worth the extra effort."
1,Worst Piece of Crap Product I've Ever Purchased,"Do not buy this product. It's a piece of junk. I'm so thoroughly disappointed, I believe the high rated reviews are from PR campaigns for this product. It's completely useless.Btw, this is my first review ever. I felt so ripped-off by this product that I had to respond.I NEVER got it working. It's a tinker toy wrapped up in a pretty box. The instructions are a joke. This whole product is a joke.DO NOT BUY IT."
4,works as described,The product works as described. Keeps some of the smoke smell from the house. We used it with a air purifier also.
1,Not a good product,"This is a horrible product, the fan is too loud, it doesn't keep smoke out of the air, its difficult to clean and it stopped working after only 2 weeks. Changed batteries and it still did not work."
4,Smokeless Ashtray,I wish it would run on electricity and not batteries. It can get expensive using batteries. They only last about a week.
4,Works Just Fine. I like it.,"This ashtray does an excellent job of grabbing and eliminating the smoke from a cigarette while it is resting in the ashtray. It does not intercept, reduce or eliminate the smoke you exhale out into the room. If you smoke in the house, and you exhale, you will still smell smoke. Just not as much smoke.Contrary to some other reviews here, the fan on mine is very quiet.I'm very satisfied with it, and would purchase again."
2,Smokeless ashtray or...,"I have owned several of these smokeless ashtrays and they are fairly good for getting rid of the smoke. However, these things always end up making the worst noise that you could imagine! In time, the plastic fan blade drops down, until it hits the bottom (inside of the ashtray). It ends up being a bit like someone running their nails across a chalkboard! Other times, the fan blade is simply warped upon purchase. Either way you are going to get a horrible noise that you can not stand to hear! Not worth buying, save your money."
2,Dies quick!,"Worked fairly well, a bit noisy, had to replace the batteries after two weeks, and it stopped working a month after purchase. Cigarettes tend to stick to the top too."
1,Doesn't work,"2 weeks after I purchased this item, it quit working.The company send me the wrong filters for my item so that was a waste of $6.00 as well."
3,It works for the ones laying there.,It works for the nasty thing that's laying in it. But how do you get the idiots to leave it there?!
4,smoke grabber,Only reason I gave a 4 star instead of a 5 is it tends to get really loud after awhile using.
5,Great Item!,This is great item! I ordered one for me and my husband(two).It keeps us from having to go outside in the cold to smoke.Keeps smoke smell out of the air and the smoke out of the air.Easy to empty.I love them.Well worth the money.
3,It was a good idea.,"I got mine. Just as I suspected I ended up not using it. The tray is small and you really had to pay attention to when you put your cigarette in. It only filter smoke if the cigarette was in the try. I knew this already but bought it anyway. I found myself trying to blow smoke out my mouth into the unit but just ended up blowing ashes everywhere. I dumped ashes everywhere everytime I tried to empty it because you need to 'snap' the tray out of there. I had to turn up my TV because it is so loud.It was more of a hassle than anything. It felt ackward and I smoke to relax, not to have some gadget stress me out. I think I'll buy an actual air filter."
1,"Loud, awkward, and shallow","In a nutshell, you can cross this one off the list if the following issues are things that will bother you:*It is extremely noisy.*The tray is very shallow - I had trouble with tumbling cigs and ashes. Also, unless you empty it after two or three cigs, it is over-full, so that when you extract the tray to empty it, butts and ashes leak into the workings underneath.*The lid, which hovers over the tray, is in the way. I kept hitting it with my hand or the cig.In short, this ashtray is poorly designed and loud. I threw it away."
2,"works ok, but....","filters the smoke ok but doesn't filter the odor. the tray is easy to remove to empty, but it is rather noisy. there has to be a better one out there somewhere."
4,Smoking,"Really is great helps eliminate alot of smoke. Seems a little noise the fan, haven't used the second one I purchased, yet. Anyway it really is nice to have around instead of smoke drifting."
2,"It's okay for the first few days, then...","This product worked really well for the first few days and then the fan became very loud. I threw it away. If you can stand the noise of it, then it is fine."
1,holmes smoke ashtray,"It broke after only 2weeks and this was my third one, would not recommend it! I did send it back and Amazon refunded my money,,,, like the concept of the ashtray, however it's cheaply made!"
2,Holmes HAP75-UC Smokeless Ashtray,"Again, this item appears useless. I really would like my money back, but there was no return address label or instructions on how to return it if I did want to return it. This was intended for my ADULT children and I have to agree it looks like it is not really what it is cracked up to be. Once you put in bottom tray and batteries the fan keeps running and you cannot shut the lid. They never even tried to use it, but I can see that it is really not going to be efficient with just a charcoal filter on the top of the lid when you cannot even contain the smoke within the unit itself. It may end up dissipating the smoke some, but it really does not appear to be something that will ensure a smoke-free environment. I can understand my children not wanting to use it."
3,Holmes Smokeless Ashtray,"This one holds my 120 length cigarettes. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that There is no way to take the bottom off to clean it. Thus the smell lingers in the bottom, even with the filter."
1,Waste of money,"As an ashtray it works fine as smokeless ashtray not even close, this product is a complete waste of money."
1,HEY!! WHERE'S THE WORKBOOK??,"Just purchased this video, began to watch it, and realized that it requires the ""Learn Math Quickly"" workbook. This workbook is not offered by (this site). Without the workbook, the video is useless as the video's instructor asks the viewer repeatedly to refer to it and perform tasks in it. Could be worth more than one star, but I guess I'll never know!!"
1,Pathetic,"Gennara Moore is upset - too many half truths, errors and nonsense littered the book to make it useful. I agree. it is not enough to pile up the list of all documents available in one library or another to make a book, You have to know what you are writing about. The result is pathetic."
3,hmmmm,"well, guess it's my fault that i didn't see the one time it mentioned this was a tin?? Nothing in the title says that and since it was coming from allposters, I ASSUMED it was a poster! It's ok, but not what I thought."
2,four pillars,"pretty good book, doesnt give as much information as far as earthly branches (animals combinations), but does talk a lot about elements etc, sort of a neutral book."
5,remains my favorite,My mother used this for years and years. I haven't used it in over 25 years myself; but thought I would give it another go. I am pleased with the results. And the price was very good. The scent doesn't linger as long as some perfumes but I like that..it works just fine for me.
2,White Shoulders by Evyan SOMETHING IS WRONG,I have used this scent for well over 25 years and never had one where the scent is gonealmost the moment you apply it. Perhaps they have changed their formula - but if my nextbottle is the same then I won't be purchasing it again. Why bother!
1,Bad Odor,"Evyan White Shoulders By Evyan - Eau De Cologne Spray - 4.5 fl. oz., 4.5 ozThis product has a very bad and peculiar odor.It is not at all like the White Shoulders items I have previously bought for my wifeI checked the return information and it can not be sent back to Amazon.I just took a hit on this purchase and it is not at all of the quality of items I have previously bought from Amazon."
1,White Shoulders Perfume,I never did recieve this purchase. I got in touch with Amazon which sent me to the company. They told me it was sent to my town and told me to canvace the neighbors to see if any bof them got it. Do you think any of them would tell me? It was droped at that.I would not recommened ordering from Amazon.
5,A voice of gold - the best tenor ever!,"This rare CD shows ""Pippo"" Di Stefano at his very best. The ""Salut, demeure chaste et pure"" as well as ""E lucevan le stelle"" and ""Parmi veder le lagrime"" are great, regarding both interpretation and unmatched vocal skills. In a shape like this, Di Stefano just deserves to be hailed as the ""tenor of the century"" (or at least the second half of it). This recital (actually recorded in San Francisco) is the top of classical vocal art - just forget Del Monaco, Corelli or Bergonzi: Di Stefano was the king!"
3,Sent a Substitue,"Sent Hitachi and not IBM. When seller contacted they basically said it is this or nothing. Not even willing to physically go check inventory so see if any IBM avaialble. Hitachi works OK so far, but they should change the ad or ship IBM"
2,"Excellent tunes are lost in dated arrangements, muddy mix","This is a CD of the '65 - '73 period, featuring Harris on tenor sax, often embellished with a Conn multivider and studio manipulation. The Harris sound is unique -- soulful, breathy, reaching for the highest register, and wonderfully melodic. Many of the tunes are icons of the period, if not standards. Regrettably, they have not weathered very well over the past 30 years. Arrangements are dated, reminiscent of the TV themes of the '70's. Remember ""Hawaii 5-0""? Creed Taylor? The arrangers on this album went to the same school. And the mix sounds as if Harris were in the linen closet while the rhythm section was in the studio. Regrettably, there were 6 producers credited on this disc, which is 5 too many."
3,The founder of electric saxaphone,Eddie was the talent and genius for which many have patterned their styles from.Listen to this and you will understand why!
3,White Bird Reloaded,"I have been a fan of ""It's a Beautiful Day"" for some time now, so learning about David LaFlamme's most recent cd came as a pleasant surprise for me. After listening to the sound clips I did not take long to decide that this cd should belong to my collection. I quite like the 2003 rendition of ""White Bird"", the same goes for ""Bombay Calling"", ""Time is"" and ""Girl with no Eyes"" which all featured on Day's 1969 debut album. The rest of the fare is worth listening to as well; I especially like the deep purplish ""Santa Cruz"". I could have done without the synthie sounds that have been interspersed here and there. All in all: Not a bad album at all - and one that lets me suppose that the LaFlamme Band is worth seeing if they're around (actually, I suppose most of the material will sound very much better live than on cd)."
3,A pleasant surprise!,"I've always enjoyed the first two ""It's a Beautiful Day"" albums, the first a psychedelic masterpiece, the second, a mixed bag of dreamy psychedelia, early country, lounge music and more. The band has been plagued for decades with issues with their former management team, hence the lack of any re-issues of older material. Then comes a David Laflamme (lead singer and violin virtuoso) solo album. I would not have bought this album if not for a reasonably favorable review from another collector. The album turns out to be pretty good. The re-makes of older "". . . Beautiful Day"" material is very listenable and the new material isn't bad, a couple of the songs actually stand out. This is by no means a great album, but for serious music fans of the ""Psych 60's"", ""Beyond Dreams"" is worth a try."
5,Do you love westerns?,"I just love westerns and this one didn't disappoint. The love scenes were HOT, HOT, HOT!!! I loved the heroine she wasn't winey or annoying, she was very independent and self-assured. The hero was a nice alpha male and the heroine really made him work to earn her trust again. **sigh** It was a very believable relationship. I was a little surprised at the ending. I don't think I'm giving anything away, there is a cattle-rustling mystery that does not get solved and continues on into the next book. So of course I have to get the next one. I also recommend anything by Sarah McCarty too. She writes great westerns and has great alpha cowboys."
4,What a Fantastic Series!,I really enjoyed book one and it's an important book to read since you meet a lot of the characters in the next 2 books. So far I've read books 1-3 with one to go and every book keeps getting better and better!!! I give book one 4.5 stars and books Two and Three 5+ stars. Definitely worth it and they are on my keeper shelf. The characters are great and you really feel like you know them and the sex is Hot! Two things I expect from a good book and so far this series has been one of the most enjoyable series I've read since the Promises series by Sarah McCarty. While this series is contemporary and not historical like the Promises series to me each of these wild book's are fantastic! A Must Read!
4,Followon the Wildcat and good read,Tis is the follow on the wildcat and follows Dean's attempts to put a stop to the rustleing ad to deal with her case of the hots for Jake who dumped her for a carrer as a lawman. The mistery continues in the next book. The sex is welll written and while the plot is weak its Ok and woith giving a better than average rating to the book.
1,G G Allin is most likely in hell,"Jesus Christ is God, not this fool. Anybody who finds a ""message"" in this garbage is not only blind, but stupid beyond any measure. Apparently there are many who are going to join this guy in hell. Why anyone would listen to this garbage is beyond me. There is no question this guy either committed a sin unto death or was demon possessed. Too late for him now. Why would anyone want to join him? A lot of idiots these days."
3,Name dropping Celeb fun,"This book is different from what I usually read.But the story line stuck out at me on the back as something that might be fun. So I thought why not? And while it started out a bit slow, it became a very enjoyable and fun read for me. The story followed Charlotte ""Lottie"" Love a valley girl from Tarzana, CA on her career path. We follow her as she goes from a nobody, to a vain glorified Pappo..and finally finding herself with the man who she thought she hated.There is a lot of name dropping of big name celebrities, and that makes the book even more fun.Kind of like reading a Tabloid magazine, you know its not true but you just cant help yourself. We follow a fun cast of characters around Lottie that you love, hate, and love again. So over all if your looking for a fast, and amusing read that gives you a chuckle. With plenty of people mooning, and flashing in drunken stupors, give this one a shot."
1,Does not fit 2000 Rav-4,"Packaging states this item is for all Rav-4's, but it does not fit the 2000 model. Labeling is incorrect for this item."
2,refund of my money,The product was nice but I have sent two notices to you that I was billed twice for this item and I want some satisfaction from you concerning this. Please look up my 2 emails and send me some kind of notice as to whether or not you are going to take care of this. Karen Elliott
3,pretty but lacks function,the design looks nice but there needsto be a distinction between which is salt and which is thepepper-- they are both exactly the same!
3,Fiesta Salt & Pepper shaker set,The salt and pepper shaker arrived in good condition with one exception. One of them did not have a stopper and therefore was unuseable. I searched for weeks before I found something that would work.
1,2nd time disappointed,"This is the second fiesta salt and pepper set that I have bought within the past 6 months through amazon. The first set I received, had a flaw in one of the shakers. (Looked as if it were chipped) My husband contacted amazon to try and get a refund/ return and had no success with them emailing him back. Out of frustration, I went ahead and recently bought the second set without ever returning the first. I received the second set recently and both shakers look great, as far as no chipping or cracks, but they both have the same number of holes in the top, making it annoying to try and figure out which shaker is which."
1,NO Top.,"I was so disappointed when I got this doll. The description said that she was wearing a ""hot purple metallic top. She has no top on!!!! Her top is paint. It really is not the sellers fault but the product description. Boo on Amazon for letting stuff like this happen. I would have never gotten the doll if I knew that part of her clothing was painted on."
5,U.S. yes!,So glad this live performance is now available in the U.S.! They are an amazing band live.
4,Just a cut below . . .,"A friend introduced me to this album's title track late last year (full disclosure: I've only begun learning my way around Coltrane's work), and I instantly knew I'd need to pick up the whole album. The title track is still the best thing about this record, with the lovely ballad ""Aisha"" (very reminiscent in mood of ""Naima"") a close second. Everyone sounds solid to me, especially McCoy Tyner's piano and the two-bass work of Art Davis and Reggie Workman. That said, this won't be the album to point people toward if they want the quintessence of Coltrane's work: its pleasures are not the transcendent ones of _A Love Supreme_, its compositions not the every-song-a-classic compositions of _Giant Steps_.In short, _Ole_ is a really good album that is very nice to have, but not (quite) life-changing."
5,Latin Taste,"Another Coltrane's jewel . In this album you can fell a bite of latin sound. The rhythmic section is fantastic, and the sax superior. Great ."
4,"Wonderful Shoes, But...","The shoe size is NOT equivalent to a street shoe size. The Plie I sizing is much smaller than your street shoe. I have worn an 8.5 shoe (trainer/sneaker, dress heel, boot) for as many years as I have been an adult, and I cannot fully get the ball of my foot into my 8.5 Plie I's. I have to sell them as a consequence. I don't know who decided that these are a street shoe size match, but they are delusional!!"
3,below expectations,"This drill underperformed in several areas. The chuck continued to break loose, the fit and finish lacked in several areas, and the torque numbers rubbed off almost immediately. In general I'm a big Black and Decker (the parent company) and DeWalt fan. Not for this product. I ended up sending it back for a Porter Cable model."
1,"Died in less than a year, crappy warranty","DVD portion kept skipping or getting stuck, now doesn't work at all. I did some searching on the Internet and this is a common problem with this brand. The warranty covers parts, but not labor so it's cheaper to buy a new one. Don't buy it!"
3,"liked it, but stopped working","I really liked this DVD player. We've had it for 2 years without any problems until today, when it just stopped working. We can't even get it to turn on. Its just dead. Dont know what happened. I wish it had lasted longer but it was a good price."
3,"Good for a while, but...","I bought this set as a gift, but ended up keeping it and using it myself. For an entire winter, I got up and did one of the 3 tapes every morning. It definitely produced good physical and mental results, but I got burned out on Wai Lana. She is kind of a kooky character, and I found myself reluctant to do the tapes and listen to her odd, almost bizarrely-sedate sounding voice. Keep in mind that you may want to rotate this set with another teacher's."
1,My Rio died 2 months after the 90-day warranty ended,"Oh, I liked the Rio Forge 256 when I got it, but I would never buy anything from Rio again...especially not a 'refurbished' model.I bought mine for some of the features that I wanted (it could hold a memory card, and could read Audible.com files), and it looked sort of groovy. I enjoyed it while it was working.I didn't do my research -- it only had a 90-day warranty. What company can't support their product (which has no moving parts!) for more than three months? When my died out of warranty (less than two months out of warranty), the level of customer service I was offered was ""You can get a replacement unit for the out-of-warranty fee of US$69."" We had a long email back-and-forth exchange where I was shunted around to different 'humans' (Nathan J., and Peter L....the 'nom du jour') trying to get someone in the company to take some responsibility for selling junk."
1,Don't waste your time!!!,The first one was really crappy. It sounded distorted when turned up past 4 and it quit after about 30 days. The second one lasted 35 days and just stopped working. When they quit they wouldn't even turn on when plugged into a computer. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Was a good 6 months,"This was a good mp3 while it lasted, which wasn't as long as i wished it would have. The sound was great, it was easy to uderstand how to move around through the menu, and it's a nice looking little thing. One problem i always had with it though is that the power button seemed to be hard to get too, and i couldn't tell if it was turning on when i pressed it unless i was looking strait at it. Another thing that bothered me was that the thing frooze alot, so i would have to take the battery to reset it. Other then that i didn't really have any trouble......... that is till now. All of the sudden, for no reason at all, i can't take music files off of it, or put them on. I've e-mailed Rio about my problem many times, but have gotten no reply, i've tride calling them too, but they still didn't supply me with any usefull advice. Its a shame that this had to happen to my Rio, cause i really liked it and was hoping to use it for another year."
2,Very very sad!,"My first MP3 I had by Rio and I absolutely loved it! No problems what so ever. Well it was a sad day when I left it at a hotel and someone stole it. So I got on amazon and ordered this one, only slightly different than my old one. I was extremely excited when I finally got it in the mail. It worked great for about 2 weeks. Then in my stuggle of studying for a very big exam I needed a break. I pulled out my Rio and my volume wouldn't turn down. I could turn it up...now music was blasting in my ears and I couldn't turn it down. So I'm very sad. I now have to return it (hopefully it goes well). Be safe...don't buy remanufactured!"
4,GREAT MP3 Player,"This is a wonderful MP3 player. Has all the otions you need plays wonderfully, is the perfect size not too small that you can't push the buttons and not too large. Great price for the product also."
1,Remanufactured?,"I purchased a ""remanufactured"" Rio Forge. When I got it, there was sand inside the unit and within two days it had quit working. This is nothing less than a pure rip off."
1,Totally disappointed,"I purchased this product on a recommendation because I was planning a long road trip. The Rio Forge came, I downloaded 2 audo books, tested it to see that it worked. Ran it a total of no more than 1 hour. Put the Rio in my bag, a couple weeks later left on a 30 hour drive. I used this exactly 6 hours before we stopped for gas. When I went to turn it on again: NOTHING. Nothing at all. I replaced batteries...wiggled, jiggled all to no avail. Total bust - and of course I was on the road with no option of doing anything within the 30 warranty! Here I am, home again, and it's several days beyond 30! Now WHAT??"
1,"Don't be fooled, It's a Rio!","I purchased a Rio mp3 player and it broke within a month. Fortunately, I was still under warranty. After many ""outsourced"" telephone conversations, they finally sent me a replacement. This model was ""refurbished"". I had purchased a new one and they replaced it with a refurbished one! That just doesn't seem right... After six months it stopped working all together.Please take heed to the poor reviews on this product... You'll be glad you did."
1,lousy product,I bought two of these and they both don't work. when I turn them on they both just shut down. waste of money
2,Nice but watch out,I love this player I just reached the 29th day and it will not come on!Died!!! Sending back to amazon!!!
2,It finally died for good...,"Ever since I got this player, I've been having problems with the internal memory having to be reformatted. That's if I can even get it to turn on. Now it won't even recognize that there is an internal memory. It's going to MP3 heaven!"
2,no good,Radio was weak and after 3 weeks this player showed error massage and PC cant open or format internal memory. (after that i crushed it with hamer)
3,Not for everyone.,"My MX 500 arrived in the mail yesterday. I was looking forward to switching from my inherited Apple ""Pro"" mouse because I had read so many great reviews on the MX 500 and its 8 buttons. Unfortunately, I returned the mouse today. It was way too big and clunky for my small hands. My wrists had started to hurt after about 5 minutes of use. Don't get me wrong, I am sure that this is a great mouse, but not for everyone."
5,Best Mouse I ever had,"This new Logitech mouse is the best mouse I have owned so far. Easy install of the Logitech Mouseware driver suite with the included CD and frequently update Mouseware on the logitech web site make this mouse great. many buttons: scroll wheel, fast scroll buttons (up and down), ALT/TAB windows switch button, forward/back web browser buttons. Fully XP compatible (you won't believe how many incompatible mice are still out there) Anything I would improve? Not much, except the buttons could be farther forward on the mouse body...I recommend this mouse..."
5,I'm spoiled now!,"This mouse has definitely lived up to everything I've read about it and more! It glides effortlessly across my mouse pad and performs very well. Seven of the eight buttons are incredibly easy to get used to; it's a very well thought out design. The eigth button that switches between applications I do forget to use, but I'm sure if I thought about it more, it would become second nature as well. When I went downstairs to use my husband's computer, it seems like a was using a Stone Age tool to control his computer. It's hard to imagine the impact this one small thing can have in your daily life unless you try it. I can't recommend it enough!!"
3,"Great mouse at the time, superceded by later Logitech models","Note that (as of this writing) you can get the Logitech MX 510 for a little less than this price, and the Logitech MX 518 for a little more. They are the successor models to this mouse, basically the same except each update adds even better resolution.If you're still reading this in 2005 or later, you're on the wrong page! The more up-to-date mice are probably conveniently listed right under the MX500 information at the top of this product page, in the section ""Customers who viewed this item also viewed."""
2,Really surprised hour poor it is,"After reading the glowing reviews I ordered the MX500 eagerly anticipating a performance jump from my year old Microsoft Blue optical mouse. The mouse is attractive and well built. I rather like the ""heft"" some people complain of and the design is comfortable. The problem is performance. The pointer is erractic (quivering, shaking pointer with ""ghost"" images flashing behind it) and the software is extremely buggy either from the CD or Logitech's site (numerous crashes that ended when I uninstalled the Mouseware drivers). Plus the CD installed Backweb Lite to faciltate online registration and updates. Little did I know that that particular program is considered Spyware by many spyware removal programs. That's really a shock from a company like Logitech. All in all I was very dissapointed with the MX500. I went back to my old MS Blue optical, downloaded the lastest drivers from Microsoft and it runs rings around the Logitech and is much more stable!"
2,Scrollwheel jumpy,"I use this mouse on OS X, and after 2 months the scrollwheel randomly jumps the page up and down, which is completely unnacceptable. This may be because I press the scrollwheel a lot (it acts as a middle mouse button.) You might not have this problem if you don't need it as a button."
4,Excellent mouse,"This is almost the perfect mouse. I wish some of the buttons were a littlebit different feeling, so it would be easier to tell them apart by feel, but overall I love it and have had no problems at all.It has a great feel to it.Way to go Logitech!"
4,it met my expectations,"I took me a while to decide whether or not to get this, but i'm glad I did. What I think the only drawback is, is that the cruise control up button is placed way too much in front of the mouse. I gotta reposition my hand just so I can reach it.( and I have fairly big hands) Besides that this mouse is awesome! I'd recommend this who wants a better mouse sure beats my old wireless intellimouse."
4,Great extra functions,"This mouse is a great little device that works well all-round. It's less erratic than other optical mice I've used.The best part about it is the programmable buttons that make surfing the web and working on text documents a whole lot easier.Only gripe: the scrolling wheal is a little hard to handle, and scrolling is thus not very smooth.But in any case, this is the best mouse I've worked with so far."
4,Lacking programmability,"Mouseware 9.76 doesn't allow you to arbitrarily define keystrokes or buttonclicks; rather, you have to choose from a list of predefined options that Logitech thinks you want. Other than that and being a bit heavy, it's a great mouse."
4,The Tracking is great but....,"The tracking and ergonomic feel of the mouse is unbelievably amazing. However, if you plan on playing games with this mouse, the 8 buttons are not usable in any games. You can use only mouse 1, 2, and scroll up and down. I found this to be quite annoying that my two button and scroll wheel mouse could atleast use the press down of the scroll wheel in games, but the mx500 cannot.Other than that issue, its the best mouse out there for feel and tracking."
1,"Mouse is nice, software absolutely STINKS!","Seized my windows XP machine, disabled almost all of my other USB input devices and now puts me in an endless loop of files not found for uninstall. I can't get it off my machine!!!!! Software tries to load all this other crap on your system. The mouse might be nice but my suggestion is that all of the logitech programmers go back to programmers school."
1,Scroll wheel's response is very slow.,"The scroll wheel is not that responsive.After you scroll the mouse, you have wait a little bitto see that happen. No, this cannot be customizable bythe program. So bad that I had to return and replace itwith MS Intelli-Mouse, which is perfect.I do not recommend Logitech mouses. They always come upwith seemingly something better and more features,but they always have a huge fundamental flaw here andthere."
4,Comfortable Mouse,"The placement of the BACK button and scroll backward buttons are good. Easy to get at and out of the way of normal use. However, the FORWARD and scroll forward buttons are difficult to use and pretty much unneccesary, since it is very rare for me to use them anyway. Under normal usage, the mouse's heaviness is unimportant...but I can imagine it could be hard on a gamer. I like the ergonomics of the mouse, as it decreases the amount of hand movement needed for normal use. The left and right mouse buttons are a little hard to push, but I actually like that, since I can rest my fingers on them without accidentally clicking them. Overall, it is a very comfortable mouse to hold and move around. For me, they could have easily left off the FORWARD and scroll forward and task changer buttons, which I now completely ignore after some brief clumsy experimentation."
5,This is the PLAYA mouse!!!,"Buy this mouse-- it whips anything Microsoft has to offer.Why:1. 7 programmable buttons plus smooth scroll wheel2. 800-dpi tracking, won't skip ever. ever.3. Flexible software lets you use Back and Forward buttons, as well as the wheel, in games.4. Sturdy, will last you years.5. Silver & black looks awesome.I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.Why:1. Intellimouse Explorer fits my hand a little better. (thats just me.)2. Most games won't recognize the Maximize, Minimize, and Program Switch buttons.Otherwise, this mouse is for YOU, playas.Simply the best wired mouse out there.Good going, Logitech."
4,Optical mice now beat traditional balls,"Until now, I've kept using traditional rubber ball mice, and become rather fussy about mouse pad tracking surfaces and rather proficient at cleaning them. The earlier optical mice I had used, including a well known expensive brand that my son has enjoyed for a year now, just didn't track as accurately.No more. Using this Logitech mouse on the kitchen table with my wife's iBook works just as well as my best PC setup with a traditional ball mouse. And the scrolling wheel works better on this Logitech.The only complaint is more my sons than mine. We both have long skinny fingers, and the shape of the ridges on the right side of the mouse don't fit our 4th and 5th fingers very well. This annoys him to the point of rejecting the mouse. I no longer notice much."
2,"nice mouse, but too big and heavy","I love the idea of a ""back"" button on the mouse, but both my husband and I did not like feel of this mouse or how heavy it is. I am prone to wrist problems and this mouse hurt my wrist - I am returning it. Also did not track as well as the little logitech optical wheel mouse we use now"
3,Good mouse but can not remap buttons to [Alt],"I love this mouse, except for one thing... The software will not allow you to remap any of the buttons to [Alt]. For games like Star Wars Galaxies, a thumb button remapped to [Alt] would be a godsend.You can remap to [Ctrl], and several other buttons, but not [Alt]. I do not understand why Logitech can not add [Alt] to the remap options, MS has inferior mice compared to Logitech's MX series, but MS includes the option to remap to [Alt]. I called Logitech Tech Support today and was told that there was no way their software could remap to Alt.Good mouse, bad software.What a shame. This was a great mouse, but I will have to return it."
1,Extremely disappointed,"...I purchased this mouse after reading the many positive reviews. But its performance is very disappointing. It won't move the cursor to where I want it to be and it's very frastrating sometimes. It is lot worse than my old microsoft wheelmouse. This is my second bad experience with optical mouse. The extra functions with this mouse like navigating are nice, but I seldom use them since a lot of browsers now provide mouse gestures that are more convinient than using the mouse."
1,Nasty Taste and Smell,"The taste and smell are so gross, I had to throw away the bottle (and I can take spoon fulls of unflavored cod liver oil without a problem)."
3,"Ok, if you have extra cash to burn buy it.","The clips available for playing I would consider the highlights of the whole cd. It does not get better. I thought after listening to the clips that I'd love the CD, but was disappointed."
3,Sputters worse than a wizard's broken wand,"After a tremendous first three tracks, the rest of the CD sputters along to a feeble finish. Miriam Stockley is credited in most of the successful tracks and her enchantments with the remainder may have salvaged this work."
2,I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS CD THAT MUCH....,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD. I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTERTHAN IT TURNED OUT TO BE. IT IS HARD FINDING GOOD MUSIC ABOUTMERLIN AND KING ARTHUR UNLESS YOU BUY MEDYWN GOODALL'S MUSIC.NOW THERE IS SOME GREAT MUSIC........
5,good quality and space saving,"I was influenced by the 1st excellent review because I debated between this model and Rabbit Air too myself.Ever since I moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan, I started having breathing problems during sleep time. This filter has helped my breathing and reduced my asthma significantly. I can also set the timer to auto shutdown after 4 or 8 hours before I leave for work every morning and come back to a fresh smelling apartment (building next door is a pizza parlor).From aesthetic point of view, I think Sharp has a nicer look. It's slightly smaller and thinner, which is great for my small studio. The white plastic casing is flimsy looking though. Rabbit Air looks a lot more expensive and modern.If only looking at technical criterias, I think both models are at par. Overall though, this model is perfect for a busy person living in a tight space."
5,A genuine auto biography,Perhaps this is my second time to read it after more than 15 years.It has always impressed me.and i wonder how how a human being could express this level of honesty to tell the most private life which most of us are ashamed even to think about telling. I feel very few tell such story and is quite natural to be like her acording Freud'view.More over it is written in splendid literary flow and i really appreciate her for the top level work she produced for the reader.
3,Panthers fan,OK read.Funny in the begining but gets really boring after 200 pages.It is sex here sex there all over the world.U just get tierd of reading it.If you are sex fanatic it will be a funn read but if not u will get Tierd of it after 200 pages
3,Happy Hooker,I read this book thirty years ago and this edition was different. Things in the first editions were not in this one.
2,What was i thinking?,"I saw a copy of this in the gift section at a Belgian restaurant in Milwaukee, and was intrigued. I was disappointed that I spent the money on it. I do recall that it was very popular in its day. Not any worse than that other book, 50 Shades of Something or Other."
4,Kindle Edition is AWFUL,"The kindle edition of this great book is an embarrassment. There are literally HUNDREDS of spelling mistakes / two words glued together (e.g. gluedtogether). It is obviously an incompetent scan of the paper book, and not a digital print from the original file. I have no idea why Amazon do this. It's unprofessional and an insult to the author and reader alike, not to mention false advertising because you are not getting the original product as advertised.I want a refund, I will post here if Amazon comply.--On the book - PAPER edition:I used to see all prostitutes as victims, but after reading this candid story I now realise that 90% of prostitutes are victims but there are 10% who have managed to live successful dignified lives. Nothing is black and white in this world, and this book details an important shade of grey.Highly recommended."
5,Top-notch!,"I bought this set for my mom last Xmas, and it was the best value of any gift I got last year. This year I will be getting a set of my own as soon as Amazon gets them back in stock.The spoons have a perfect curve on them that is very pleasant in your mouth when eating cereal. They are heavyweight compared to any set up to triple the price, and good quality as they're made in Japan. They were well-machined, without sharp edges or anything bad about their construction at all. Those customers who hastily sent them back without even trying them missed out on what has become my favorite flatware anywhere..."
4,Nice set,"This set is not fancy so it'd be good for everyday use. The one thing I like about this set is that it is Stainless Japan, not the China, Vietnam or Korea kind that you'll find in the more fancy and expensive Oneida, Misaka, or Hampton Silversmiths sets. I think this set will last for a long time."
1,Why didn't I listen??,"The above reviews are correct. Sharp edges!! On bowls of spoons and ends of handles. Could have returned, but UPS would have been almost equal cost of flatware. At least it was cheap. Instead, I buff down several pieces each night and regret not filing a lawsuit ;)"
5,Good sturdy flatware,"We were looking for a economical set of stainless for our RV. This set is nothing fancy but should last us forever. Pieces have a good heft to them,the tines on the forks (which is to us a good indication of quality) seem quite strong. Spoons and knives also seem very durable.A very good value!"
2,Not as stunning as pictured...,"Now I understand the differenced between 18/0 and 18/10. This is a 18/0 stainless steel set, which means that it's easier to get rusty and not so polishing as 18/10 stainless set. It also has rough edge. Not suitable for gift purpose or formal dinner! Considering the price, it's still a good buy if you always lose your forks and spoons."
4,Great price for product,I purchased this set to use for Thanksgiving dinner in '06. I got two sets for the price it would have been to rent the flatware from a local party supply store. When they arrived I was impressed for the weight of the pieces comparable to the price. Not your showcase flatware but would be great for a first apartment or house warming present. Has plenty of pieces so that if you loose one or two you can still function.
3,Better than nothing,"I had a deep scratch in my counter and went over and over it with this kit. The scratch is MUCH less noticeable, but still there. Also, the sheen in the area is not the same as the rest of the counter, but only noticeable in sun light.This product works very well, though, on burns. I had a yellowed spot from a pot and this remover did well (but still resulted in the same sheen issue).Obviously, for the price, I recommend it. But, if you are picky or getting your house ready for resale, hire a professional."
1,Painful is the word,"The most heinous and cruel part of this film was the sticker price I paid for it. I frankly could not believe my eyes and I found myself fast forwarding through this elementary piece of bore. The acting was third tier, the storyline was cardboard, the acting extra mediocre and the gore, well, the silicone nether regions tell you all you need to know. This was tantamount to some middle school aspiring director, grabbing his camera and having his family participate in this debacle. Do yourself a favor as the previous rating suggested and pay attention to those that actually have a fondness for this genre and decry this films inadequacies. A two dollar bin at (the now almost defunct) Blockbuster would be steep in terms of price."
4,awesome,"This movie is definitely worth watching, although the acting did ruin some parts of the film. The main character was fantastic, but the rest looked like they were reading the lines from a book for the first time. Some of the dialogue was a bit too long, but I like the director's concepts and enjoyed watching it."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I am sure all the positive reviews are by people associated with this garbage. I however am not, and will be very honest; it is a piece of trash! Amateurish production, filmed with a hand held cam-cord; the special effects are Heinz Ketchup.I turned it off after 15 minutes and went to Best Buy, since they will give you a $5.00 coupon on returned DVDs. I only lost about 15 minutes of my life and around $3.00."
1,Dont believe everything they say,"So I fell into the trap with all the great reviews and high star ratings of this film. let me say pay attention to the lesser positive reviews for this, rather than the overly posative ones. My one star rating goes only to Alexi Ryan for his role as Adam, he was believable as a person with issues, however the rest of the film was blah and boring,way too much time talking and just doing nothing interesting, even the altercation scene at the party was lame and left me rolling my eyes, the so called ""gore"" effects were cheezy and not believabe, there were some reviews that said the opening scene was so brutal....really?..I've seen better in a PG13 movie.....(WARNING: scene spoiler alert). The close up of a girls vagina being stabbed was so bad, it was just a silicone sex toy that was used....so poorly done. So please be warned, this one is not what they say it is, don't be fooled like I was."
1,Awful,"So I watched this piece of work with a few friends this evening, and was thoroughly embarrassed that I asked my friends to watch this movie with me. I wasted 9.95$ and about an hour and a half of my life. Acting was terrible, effects were garbage and majority of the movie I was extremely bored due to the long dragged out stoner conversations the main character and his friends were having. If you are looking for a movie that will disappoint, purchase this film."
1,DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY!,"First I wish I could get my money & time back! This movie looks like it was made as a High School project & failed! U can tell they're trying to be shocking & end up with lame! The plot is a good one if made right this could be a very good movie but the acting is extremly bad the effects are even worse! Way to much talking,,,the supposed badass & his girlfriend are more funny than badass! The sceen with the knife & female parts are the worst I've ever seen! U can tell the maker of this film was trying for shocking & failed! I read the reviews & I believe all the 5 stars & great reviews are friends of the guy that made this film! Don't waste ur money!"
1,Don't believe the hype,I havent seen the film but all the perfect ratings are probably from the director himself trying to hype his own movie up so people will buy it. I aint falling for it. Probably a terrible movie. So everyone save your money. Probably doing you a favor. Its MY PURE JOY to save you money
3,"Not bad, but could be better","Third part of a series; however, it relies too much on happenings in the first two books and does not stand well on its own. You can figure everything out, but recaps of the first two books would help a lot with the plot."
4,Tying it all together,This is the one in the series that finally tied a lot of things together for me.There was a little bit of rehashing bit and pieces from other books which was becoming tedious by the time I got to this book but it was a good read.
2,Disappointing.....,"After reading every book in this series, and just about everything else Mr. ""Donegan"" has written, this one disappointed me greatly. It seems like it could have been a good book but ultimately felt unfinished. Apparently the story needed to come to an end but there was simply no way to do it justice in the number of pages alloted. I was left with several very big ""how did he know that?"" questions.It is a shame and certainly not inidicative of this author. I'll still read whatever he comes out with next."
2,Takk for nothing,"I was very disappointed with this program. But I was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases. Even so, the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating. I learned more Icelandic (along with correct pronounciations) while in Iceland than I did with this program. And besides, anyone under the age of 50 in Iceland speaks English."
5,"The History Behind ""Gates of Fire""","I read this book after reading Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire. If you are interested in the historical background surrounding the Battle of Thermopylae, this is an excellent resource. It is thought-provoking and gives a good account of the events surrounding the epic battle. It is not so burdened with names and dates that it becomes unwieldy. This is one of the more enjoyable historical accounts that I have encountered recently."
4,Thermopylae:Battle for the West,"This book captures the scope and great significance of the battle of Thermopylae. Bradford does a great job in the way that he pulls together facts, opinions, and history together in a superb way. A must-read for any history buff."
3,Textbook Blah,"The book arrived very quickly after my purchase (less than a week) and is in excellent condition.As for the book, it has not kept my attention for several reasons...and I am a huge history/war buff. For one it is written in a very textbook manner; bland. I feel like I am an ADHD teen on prom night trying to stay awake while the teacher drones on and on about nothing I care about. The writer must not speak English well, as there are many spelling errors and pronunciation errors. Also, it is extremely difficult to follow what is going on, as the writer does not describe what certain words mean in the context he applies them. The writer also jumps around and does not stay on the subject he is discussing or complete his thought about the paragraph. Very confusing and annoying. I'm going to finish it, but I actually purchased another book about the Battle at Thermopylae because it is such fascinating history."
3,Enjoyable Account of this Great Battle,"This book offers the reader an enjoyable and interesting narrative of that most famous battle at Thermopylae. The author makes it clear that its not going to be a in-depth account but more of an overview of the battle and the Persian campaign against the Greek City States. If you are looking for a more detailed and scholarly book I would suggest Peter Green's book titled 'The Greco-Persian Wars'. Overall, bearing in mind that this book was published in 1980, this is a decent book covering Thermopylae and how the Spartan's fought and why. It made me want to go and hire the old classic video of the 300! Well worth the time to sit down and read."
5,A Glance Tells the Story,Regretfully my copy has been destroyed but this wonderful piece of art is not only beautiful but it gives us an instant view of the world for the past FOUR THOUSAND YEARS. It is fantastic!Carol in Arizona
4,"""Stepping Razor"" cuts a convincing slice of life...","An unflinching and unexpectedly moving portrait of musician Peter Tosh. This is not your typical ""rockumentary"", as it delves more into the political and spiritual aspects of its subject as opposed to the the usual formula of concert footage + backstage drama. One minor criticism, (personal pet peeve) is the director's over-use of the ""JFK"" style inter-cutting of real footage with actor portrayals to illustrate some events; but this will not distract most viewers. There are also a few dubious statements made (and presented as fact);specifically, the insinuation that Tosh was the the real leader and force behind the Wailers and that Bob Marley was just a puppydog-like follower. Like the Beatles or other groundbreaking bands,I think it was more of a symbiotic blend of two (or more) massive talents that made the Wailers such a powerful influence. Nitpicks aside-- this is required viewing for reggae fans!"
5,A Prophet,"This video is one I have watched countless of times and will watch it again and again. (I wish it was available on dvd so that the quality would not deteriorate). The words of Peter is that of a prophet, when I watch this video, I always click to the bible on King David. Somehow they seems to be very similar. The concert clips are the best."
1,Too Hot,This mattress pad is very hot and makes you very uncomfortable at night. I would definitely not recommend it.
2,Little more than Muzak,"I had high hope of this album devoted to bluegrass covers of Beatles tunes. However, I was disappointed to discover that the album lacks creatvity. Most of the songs sound like orchestral arragments mearly picked on guitar and banjo. Nicely done, but I would like to see much more creativity put to a good idea."
4,Add this to your collection ASAP! STAT!,"There is no excuse for any dance or pop fan to not have this and its counterpartShakedown 2in his or her collection. This price does seems awfully high though, so I suggest going to Amazon.co.uk and purchasing both Shakedowns (four discs total!) for only $20 after shipping and currency conversion.About the tracks, this kicks off with the brilliant Déjà Vu, one of the disco remixes the Freemasons created for Beyoncé's B'day album (Ring the Alarm makes the cut on Shakedown 2). The highlight of the set is Faith Evans' Mesmerized, which takes the original and ups the tempo to incredible heights. That spoken word intro is beyond genius. Other excellent tracks include Atlantic, Pacific, Nothing but a Heartache and Watchin'.Don't hesitate adding this and its sequel to your collection. Freemasons deserve more success and recognition in the US, so please spread the word!"
2,Flatware Photographs Better Than It Looks In Person,"I'm disappointed in this flatware set. From the picture provided by Amazon it looks chic and classy, but in reality it looks cheap--like something you would find at Big Lots. It's fine for everyday use, which is what I bought it for, but you really do get what you pay for. I was looking for an affordable, yet elegant service for 8 set and it was definitely affordable, but at $54, it was ""too good to be true"" in terms of elegance. The next time I purchase flatware, I'll buy it in person so I can see what I'm really getting.If you just need flatware for very casual use that is not meant to impress, this will do."
4,great but short,"This is a great snipet of a CD. The music is jazzy, snazzy, fun and upbeat but short. Could have been longer for the hefty price."
3,Music is a 10 but why the condensed version?,STOP!!! STOP!!! The complete 2 disc soundtrack is $1 more. Forget this version.Get the 2 disc. It has it all. By the way...AMERICAN GRAFFITI is an amazing movie and the music is part of what makes it so great.
5,American Graffiti,This was a gift for my husband for Christmas. It came quickly and it's all it claims to be.
2,This book is really outdated,"I've no doubt that the author is/was a mathematical genius. I'm giving two stars instead of 1 because I'm sure it was a great book when it came out...IN THE 80's!!!!!Apologies to the previous reviewer, but this book is out of print for a reason. Discrete Math has developed past the information in this book. The style in which this book is written is ancient and some of the examples are really cryptic. Actually, it doesn't have examples, just theorems and proofs.If you are a teacher evaluating this book for use in the classroom...PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE use something more modern. My teacher has decided to use this for a discrete math review. I enjoyed my discrete math class a few years ago when the teacher used a more modern book, but this discrete math review is really boring. Root cause of boredom + head scratching = this book!"
2,Yikes,"Im not trying to compare ""Voices"" to ""Stories and Alibis"" because there is no comparison but I dont know what the heck happened here. I bought Voices the minute Best Buy opened and was surprised to hear 11 tracks of sheer boredom. Call it what you want to call it, mature sounding, different, whatever. The bottom line is that ""Voices"" just isn't that good of a CD for any type of music genre. Atleast not to me. I can't really see MR getting any more popular from this album and if they do, somethings wrong."
2,Just not the same,"Wow, I bought the Voices the day it came out and needless to say I'm really not that impressed. Sure most of the songs aren't bad, but if I were to make a ""greatest hits"" compliation of their Stories and Alibis (and even West for Wishing), I wouldn't include any of the new material on it. You grew popular from the sounds of Stories and Alibis, then why change? Its like the old saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". I'm deeply saddened by this as one of my other favorite bands, Boys Night Out released a new album this past summer and they changed a lot as well. Although I like the BNO cd much more than I like the new MR cd. I hope this doesn't continue to be a trend (like when Senses Fail releases a new album in the next few months or so). All in all, I would recommend this album. But, in my opinion, all the songs sound somewhat similar and it is a step backwards for MR."
2,What happened!,"Ok all I have to say for this review is that MR's first cd was way better than this one. I dont know what happened to them. The lyrics are dull, the instrument makeup is nothing new. I do give credit to the guitarists, they have improved but I dont hear anything else that is appealing to me. I had my hopes set way too high for this cd. I am sad to say that I'm disappointed."
2,they changed,"If you really like their first cd, don't get this. If you didn't like their cd, you might like this."
1,I would like a refund....,"This album sucks, period. It's so bad that I just got done checking the Best Buy policy on returning or exchanging CD's. Unfortunately for me I am stuck with this crap. I now own a 10 dollar drink coaster. I loved their first album but the follow up is just terrible."
1,Too much,Sure a band is suppose to evolve but if any of you loved old Matchbook Romance i would suggest to not even bother with their new CD. How a band can go from great song like My eyes burn and playing for keeps to this TRASH is unbelieveable. Go back to the original stuff. The best thing about Matchbook was their awsome sceam and you dont hear it once in the new CD its almost EMO but crap slit my wrists emo. Sorry but obviously my mind cant open that far when a band is willing to sell out so much.
5,Caution!! must listen with an open mind...,Ive Loved this band for sooo long. Stories and Alibis is in my opinion one of the greatest albums that has ever come out for there genre i mean i'll throw my Mp3 player on random and as soon as a song from that album comes on i have to listen to the whole album..SO..is Voices By Matchbook Good..I think it is..but..alot of bands seem to want to do something more something different...And in this case i think its great..Matchbook is Darker in this album but not in a bad way..im not gonna lie it sounds like a completely different band..but the change is not bad..give this album a shot but keep in mind your not getting another..Stories and Alibis
4,awesome!,"""Voices"" is awesome! In June 2006 I went to a Yellowcard concert- Matchbook opened for them. I bought a Matchbook shirt (I didn't even know their music then, haha) and then I bought this CD, too. I love it! My favorite songs are ""Say It Like You Mean It"" and ""Monsters."""
4,New & Different are the words,"Yeah this album is much different than Stories and Alibis, but thats OK in my mind. At least they were attempting to do something a bit creative...they went for it and came up a bit short. The first half of the album is awesome, but it seems to taper off from that...best songs are #2, #5, #6, #1. It'll be interesting to see what they do next."
1,WOWWWWWWWW!!!!,"Yup. That pretty much sums up my reaction of this cd. I've heard some tracks on Stories and Alibis and thought it was very catchy and sounded good. So, naturally i wanted to pick their new effort up. Umm, darn, i said effort. To put it lightly, MBR has changed their style...for the worse. I had to force myself to get through the first 3 songs and after #6, i couldn't take it anymore so i took it out of my CD player. Mabye tracks 7 and on are better, i dont know. I do know that it wont change my opinion on this cd however. The CD dosen't plain suck, it just plain lacks.....everything. This record is awesome at being nothing. This album is at BEST mundane. The only track that was even somewhat ok was Monsters. If you're a fan of Stories and Alibis, do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this unless u want a one of a kind top quality drink coaster. It works pretty well for that. Or mabye a doorstop.....or frisbee...."
2,Hm...,"I was dissapointed. I heard a sample part of one these songs, I liked their sound.Then I bought the CD.Blah. It was depressing. It sounded evil. Sometimes they sound kind of demonic.He keeps singing about taking advantage of young girls and stuff like that.It bothered me, to state it plainly."
1,lame,nothing like there first album there first album was good this one they sound totally different and it sucks they sold out!
5,My God. Where has this CD been?,"Usually with artist albums, it takes me few listens to understand and like the music. I took to this immediately. I heard about Adam Johnson because he produced track 2 on Sasha's Fundacion NYC (Four Squares) as well as track 2 on John Digweeds Fabric 20 (Traber). This album is kind of spacey and some of the tracks are very danceable. If I had to guess this is one of the greatest artist electronic albums around. There were only 2000 copies made I believe, so if you find this, buy it.PHENOMENAL"
5,A hit!,"I thought there were going to be tons of Maries wandering around the huge party I attended at the Museum of Natural Science in Houston. I saw 3: one was amazing, obviously something she had made herself or had made by a professional: full length, amazing detail, sumptuous fabric, truly incredible. In fact, I think she won the contest. The other girl I saw had a simple short costume like this, with a wig and such, but something about the Leg Avenue one I was wearing, with its gorgeous blue brocade and sweet details, drew attention.I had people left and right asking for their pictures with me. Two older ladies even asked if I had made the costume myself! I completed the costume with a grand, very tall white wig that was perfect, along with false eyelashes and a real antique cameo choker and matching earrings.This is, hands down, the best costume I have ever had. I adore it. I may even wear it again next year. I may even wear it when I vacuum the carpets. I LOVE this costume!"
5,Check Out Greg's Music,"Greg Greenway is a hidden musical treasure. He sings from the heart with conviction. Great voice, lyrics and messages. Also check out the latest collaboration with Joe Jencks and Pat Wictor...Brother Sun."
2,"Could have been much, much better","I'm not sure that a coffee table book for reggae is entirely appropriate but that's what Reggae Explosion tries to be. Unfortunately, it fails to achieve it's goals on almost every level. The text isn't nearly as informative or insightful as The Rough Guide to Reggae or Reggae Routes but I'm not sure that people buy this kind of a book for text anyway. Some of the photography is is very good, but the layout is so busy and so desperately avant garde that the quality of the photos themselves is often obliterated. Given the price tag, I'd wait until it was remaindered and even then I'd think twice (that fact that I bought it just indicates I'm way too compulsive)."
1,Far too basic...,"....to be useful. Learn colors, time, food, and numbers, but you won't learn how to pronounce anything on your own or put a sentence together, let alone learn any meaning of the words in the few sentences they offer to teach. If memory serves you well, you can parrot the few sentences, but overall you'd be better off taking a bunch of pictures of the same items and pointing and grunting when it comes time to communicate. Also, quite a few of the words they want to teach you are english derivatives, like auto, bus, telephone, cola, etc. Save your money, find another resource. This is more game software than educational."
4,The Villiage Gate Is Open,"With this album, Herbie Mann successfully opened the doors to contemporary ""groove jazz"" and the joys it holds. Also: very rare. The internet is the only place I've ever found it."
1,Disappointing,"Ms. Small's characters are NOT likeable. All are like sociopaths who rationalize their bad behaviors over and over again. Fiona kills her first husband, but then this behavior is ""OK"", because she settles down and marries her ""true love"". Then she rats on this ""true love"" for no reason. The heroine, Catriona, is little better. Her ""body"" betrays her constantly (of course, her heart is loyal?). I just don't ""get"" Beatrice Small's books. Yuck!"
5,This is one of the best to read for escape to another time.,"There are not many books that can project a reader into thick of things like this one.The flair and discriptive writting style,make this the book to transport you from your world to hers."
3,Didn't enjoy it...,"Now, don't get me wrong.I love Francis Stewart-Hepburn. He is a great hero. But the way Cat gets treated over and over and over and over... well after awhile its just like she's trying to make the book longer.I also find it unbelievable that one woman could survive all of that.However, it is still a good book, and its nice to get a look at James Leslie's Mother."
5,My first (& still favorite) Bertrice Small book!,"I picked up this book out of boredom over 10 years ago, and was intstantly entranced by the story and the characters. It is more than a typical ""romance"" novel, as there is a good story, and much historical detail as well. I have re-read it many times since, and consider it to be the best of Ms. Small's books, even better than the first ""Skye O'Malley"" books! I highly recommend it."
2,I'm not impressed,"I can say that I'm a Beatrice Small fan. Only, I don't care for this particular book. There were too many despicable situations that Catriona could have gotten herself out of. I understand that women didn't have much of a choice back in this era, but if there is a will, there is a way. First off, if I'm that beautiful and remotely think that the king would use his position to lure me into his bed, I would never go to court despite the laird's objections. That alone would save a whole lot of trouble. I think what really set me off on this book is that both the king and her husband rape her at her home. TOO MUCH VIOLATION!"
2,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!,"My second Bertrice Small book read, and this one threw me over a cliff. The main character Cat, had me so fustrated in her choices that it left little sympathy for what she suffers.The male characters deserved even less.What a mess. It was full of lot of sex, and little else. I advise one get this book from the library , instead of paying for it otherwise it would be a poor choice of monies well spent.N."
4,"Good, but a little disturbing","I really liked this book and thought it was a great story, but I found all the rape to be just a little bit disturbing. It wasn't one of my favorites of hers, and I love Bertrice Small's books - I'm devouring them at an alarming pace. But it was still good."
4,Have to have it,"This is just too good not to have in the collection, but I think it's more than good enough work to have merited a better interpretation than it got here."
4,Somewhere in Time CD,"Loved the music in the movie and wanted the CD. Wish the pieces could be expanded instead of brief ""movie scene"" segments."
5,Music that angels listen to,"This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time I think. It almost puts you in a trance. I had them play parts of these songs as I walked down the aisle at my wedding. Instead of people commenting on my gown, they asked what music was playing just then. It fits every mood and sends goosebumps down my spine. It is music I would expect angels to listen to. The melodies say it all without any word or lyrics. I must say anyone with an appreciation for music will adore this album. It is wonderful addition to anyone's music library."
4,Original soundtrack recording is more moving.,This version lacks poetical pause and drawl on notes that make the original version so emotionally powerful. It is a strict musical composition.
5,Beautifully soothing,"I have the original movie soundtrack, and I love the variation on this particular CD by John Barry. The music is so moving, oftentimes it brings a tear to my eye. Nice to listen to when you need to relax and unwind, nice background to read to, or even when you need some time just to reflect and think. This is to me, some of the most beautiful music ever written."
2,Really not that good.,"I almost always enjoy Jennifer Weiner's books, but I found this one to be slow paced. It is the story of Sylvie, a politician's wife, and their two daughters, Lizzie and Diana. Syvie has just discovered that her husband had an affair and she realizes that she has given up her entire self to look after him for all of those years. She leaves and tries to rebuild her life and her self-esteem. Her daughter, Diana, is a physician trapped in a loveless marriage and carrying on an affair with a resident at her hospital. Lizzie is the former addict trying to piece together her life and ends up in a situation she was not planning on.While the premise of the story is strong, I felt the characters development was not thoroughly hashed out, nor was the ending. I felt let down with this one."
1,Disappointing,Have enjoyed all the other books I've read by Jennifer Weiner. This one was boring and mundane. Finished it because I paid for it. Don't waste your money.
2,please wake me up when it's over,"I was very disappointed with this book and agree with another previous reviewer that ""nothing happened"". The book canbe easily put down at any moment and never picked up again."
1,"Boring, not a typical Jennifer Weiner novel","I pre-ordered this book for my Kindle and have read all of the author's novels. I couldnt even get a quarter of the way through the book before requesting a return and refund. The characters couldn's be more stereotypical, the plot never advanced, and I couldn't care less about what happened. I was so disappointed after having loved all of Weiner's other novels and can't believe this book was even published."
3,Just can't get into it!,I've had this over a week and it is just not doing it for me. A disappointment compared to her other works. Glad I got it from the library. I'm glad I'm not the only one seeing this...
2,Disappointed Jennifer Weiner fan,"I usually enjoy Jennifer Weiner's books but was disappointed by Fly Away Home. I don't want to give away spoilers but many of the story lines were very predictable and even a little dull. I didn't connect, or really care about, any of the characters. I was especially frustrated of the treatment of Lizzie, the just-out-of rehab addict. Her family drinks around her? And hires her as a nanny of her 6 year old nephew? And I'm no prude but it seems a little irresponsible of the characters to sleep around with no concerns of getting pregnant or STD's. Also Jennifer Weiner has one crazy/irresponsible stereotyped sister and of course the other is a perfectionist/good student stereotyped sister, just like in ""In Her Shoes"". In real life we are not all one or the other!I wouldn't waste your time on this book."
2,Started out okay and then went downhill,"Predictable summer read. A ""C+"" at best. No surprise ending or ""ah ha"" moment. Just average."
2,A Firecracker!,"Starts out with a bang, fizzles at the beach, the sputters & dies at the rest area. What else can I say? Such strong characters, but little development. My first JW book, & most likely my last."
3,Entertaining but not her best work,"I enjoyed the book and I liked that it showed that some people can redeem themselves while others' lives are not as perfect as they seem. However, I didn't like the whole ""ripped from the headlines"" type thing. The note at the end of the book mentioned something about how this story was started long before Silda Spitzer, Jenny Sanford, etc., but I felt like leaving out those specific names would've made the book seem less forced. Bringing in the real life examples made it seem like the author was trying too hard to make the book socially and culturally relevant to this time (something that Jane Green has been doing in many of her recent books). That one thing alone took away from the book. Otherwise, it was a fun read."
2,Disappointing.....,"I am almost halfway thru this novel, reading tons of background information but very little real interaction between characters. I don't have a lot of money to spend on books and when I read the first chapter I felt it would be a satisfying read. It seems that most of the book is all about background info and that is how the book is written (at least the first half). I am now fighting my way thru this novel. It was not a good choice for me. I am disappointed......"
3,Not my favorite,"This was not my favorite book of hers. I felt some of the characters were a bit unbelievable...such as the physician daughter and her husband, The story was slow moving at times. However in the end the story was redeeming. I guess what I missed most was Jennifers humor and the realism she puts into her characters."
1,Disappointing,I waiting a long time to get this book from the public library and what a disappointment. The story was extremely boring. Don't bother to purchase this book.
5,Fell in love all over again!,I fell in love with Jennifer Weiner all over again. It was one of the best books I've read in a very long time!
3,ok,"it was a very soft story, very little detail of of the girls background. did not like the ending arlene"
3,Pretty ok,"A good beach type read...not one that you couldn't put down but decent enough...Wiener is a good writer, the plot just wasn't that dazzling"
2,"Nice, but not wonderful",A nice story that needed to up it's game. The ending was rather disappointing; basically it could have used a little more depth.
2,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed Jennifer Weiner's other books. This one the story links seemed weak, the characters lacked development. Was readable, but not particularly worthwhile."
2,Disappointing....,"I kept reading only because I was sure that, at some point, something interesting would happen. But it didn't! And after a while all the cooking references really started to grate on my nerves."
2,Too long and slow. This story could have been condensed into a 100 page short story.,"I read this book for a book club and it was very hard to get through. The author spends a lot of time describing minute details about everything leading me to believe I would eventually discover the point of all the descriptive writing, but nothing ever came of it. The storyline picks up half way through the book, but it's still just a silly story. Sounds like a chick flick movie that I'd rather see as a movie with a star studded cast. This long book was too slow for me and filled with insignificant details. Cute story, but not for a 400 page book."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed in this book. I love all of Weiner's past books, but this one almost put me to sleep. I could only make it halfway through before I just had to quit it."
3,Book was okay...,"Quick read- very ""already been in the news"" kind of story, but interesting if you like family dynamic type books."
5,Great summer read,"I thought this was a very well-written novel on family & relationships. Not the usual mindless ""chick-lit"". Still a page-turner and kept me up a few nights!"
4,Fly Away Home,"This novel was entertaining enough, but nothing spectacular. The story wasn't entirely fresh and the author was in the heads of the characters too much, which would be okay if the characters actually had more interesting thoughts."
3,A little slow,"I have read all of Jennifer's books, this one by far is the hardest read. It is very slow moving....Have not finished it but I am in the last part of the 2nd part."
3,Not my favorite Jennifer Weiner Book,First let me say that I have read everything Jennifer Weiner has written to date. I was very excited to read this book but felt so disappointed after reading it. The characters were well developed but not particularly believable and I anticipated every plot point in the book. I couldn't feel the energy in this book that I felt in other's she has written. It felt like a formula chick novel and not one that I will read again.
1,redundant,"Jennifer Weiner missed it in this book. Lazy writing, boring characters, gratuitous, explicit sex, and a huge disappointment. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, least of all the wronged wife. No humor, as in Jennifer's other books. And if she had written ""Are you alright"", or ""you OK"" one more time when trying to convey concern, I would have thrown the book. This book is going to the free book rack at my local drugstore, or the trash if I hadn't spent money on it. Ms. Weiner lost my respect with this book."
1,completely predictable,i found this book to be at best one to be read by women in a book club who have been drinking while getting their nails done. It was so predictable i wish i could get my money back. i can see why so many kindle readers were disappointed.
2,disappointing and unoriginal,"I love Weiner's past work but I found the first 200 pages so incredibly boring that I almost put it down for good. Once the story picked up a bit, I experienced acute deja vu... the relationship between and the personalities of the sisters exactly mirrors Rose and Maggie from In Her Shoes! There just wasn't any punch to his novel and I was very disappointed."
2,Not my cup of tea - reading for the beach?,"To be fair, I just read a really great novel before this one. Plus I think I'd enjoy it as a movie, but the book didn't do it for me. Makes me think of a modern day Danielle Steele work. I ended up skimming through the pages, reading all the dialogue, but it bored me too much to read each and every word. I got the whole story, except I didn't even care enough to read the last chapter. For me it just felt like it was whipped out due to the references of current infidelities and the mentioning of Suri Cruise a few times. I found that to be a turn-off like the author was trying too hard to make it current. I think I prefer classics and quirkier novels more. I'm sure it would be entertaining at the beach or the pool since missing pages by distractions would not result in losing the storyline."
2,Not my Favorite Jennifer Weiner Book,"I was a huge fan of Jennifer Weiner, but recently, I'm not in love with her books. This one was no exception. The character development was lacking for the two daughters. The only character that was followed in depth was Sylvia (and she was the most boring of the three of them). I think too much was going on in the story and not enough was explained deeply enough. I think fewer, more concentrated story lines would have been better for this book."
3,Did Not Love Any of the Characters,"This is very well-written and Weiner is definitely a natural talent, but I didn't completely connect with any of the characters so I wanted more things to happen to retain my interest. I liked each characters' inner and back stories at the beginning, but it goes on for so long that I started ""tuning them out,"" the way you would tune out a companion who's going on and on. It's almost a victim of Weiner's wonderful talent for conversational sharing."
2,Was not in love,"Although I am a big fan, i really did not feel that this book had her typical style that usually has me turning the pages and swept away by the storyline. Very disappointed and can't say that I would recommend."
2,strictly a light romance,"I liked little about this book. It was too topical, the characters were too extreme, it was hard to care about any of the characters, and things were just way too conveniently wrapped up. For me, a book should open a door to new ways of thinking or new insights about the world. The book failed miserably in this regard."
4,Not Her Best,"I agree with other reviewers that plot points felt borrowed from previous Weiner novels. I also found it to be thoroughly predictable, and that was a little disappointing. I kept waiting for the characters to draw me in further into the story, but I could never relate to them. Quite frankly, they never seemed to relate to each other either. I enjoyed the contemporary aspects of the novel, and I do enjoy Weiner as a writer, but she's written much better. Read 'Good in Bed' or 'Little Earthquakes' instead."
3,Short on laughter and fun,"I have loved all of Jennifer Weiner's past efforts- especially Goodnight Nobody which didn't seem to go over as well as her other books. This is a nice novel- but that's all it is. Normally I'm driving my husband crazy snorting with laughter as I'm reading her books, and I think this one might have elicited a single chuckle through the whole thing. Humor is a lost art in women's fiction as far as I'm concerned, and Jennifer Weiner was one of the few that had a great comic voice. I found this to be her most pedestrian, mainstream effort. Had it been written by anyone else, I don't know that I would have been so disappointed, but I depend on her to be funny! Hope she's back to form in her next book."
2,Disappointed...Predictable AND factually inaccurate,"I loved previous works by this author; ""In Her Shoes"" and ""Good In Bed"" were great reads. This was extremely predictable and bland. Further, there were aspects of the book that were simply not plausible; one example being the circumstances behind Diana's release from the hospital. I understand that not all authors have insight into the workings of other professions, but some background research or just calling a friend in a profession can lend much more plausibility to a plot line. In fact, I just stopped reading after that moment because the whole book just seemed pointless.I'd like to see Jennifer Weiner write a book without the usual character she employs - maybe a book without an affair as a central focus for a character. Her previous books demonstrate her talent; perhaps she just needs take her writing along a different path."
2,This book won't make the Best Seller list!!,"I bought this book because there was such a great review in my local paper. What a waste of money this was for me along with my time. If you enjoy adult books then this one is up your alley! I was so surprised that I even finished this book. I can usually read a book in a day or two. This one took me almost two weeks to read. I was hoping that the trash in this book would end. I guess there should be ratings on books now too. If there was one I would say this book should receive a triple ""X"" rating."
4,fly away home,nancy friedman st louis mo oddly enuf the credits and acknowledgements were as good as the book. good read and a classy author
2,Incorrect Information,"Very sad to see that there was repeated incorrect medical information relating to Type 1 Diabetes. The information presented in the book could actually cause the death of a person with Type 1 Diabetes, not treat them. How come there has been no public acknowledgement of this? I contacted the publisher and author and never heard from them. It is mindboggling to me that a bestseller can have completely inaccurate and dangerous medical information. Weiner and Hendricks should acknowledge their mistake."
3,Pretty Good,"This was my first book by Jennifer and I did enjoy it, however I did hope for more. The story weaves in and out of the mother and her two daughters and for the most part keeps you turning the pages, however there were parts where I started to skim as there were too many little details about cooking, clothes, ect ect. I also hoped this book would have more of the family bonding on the beach. All in all it was a good book and I will definitly check out some of her other books."
5,excellent read!,"I think this is her best book. Her characters and life events are so real; you feel you know the characters so well and care for them and worry about them. This was one I could not put down, and did recommend it highly to my friends."
3,A little slow getting started.,"It took a while for the book to get started. I found myself getting into it when i was 2/3 of the way done. Good book, but not as much fun reading as her others."
5,Profound and funny,"Weiner does a masterful job of portraying a complex series of family dynamics in profound and humorous ways. Her characters are like many of the persons we have met along the way ,and I was touched by their development and insights. Weiner has a beautiful way with words and never falls prey to overkill.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest"
2,Hard to finish,"Love Jennifer, but this was not her best work. Usually, when I pick up one of her books, I can't put it down, it's so entertaining. This one was just the opposite, for me. I kept laying it down and going back to it later. I didn't like the way the chapters were laid out, for each character, going back and forth - made it difficult to follow IMO. I highly recommend all her other books; they are fabulous! Not this one. :("
3,Good features but volume is too low even when cranked,"A good choice for most folk. Has very good features for the money. However, they are not very good in a noisy environment. The volume just isn't loud enough."
2,transmission distance is lousey,This unit bareley transmits one mile between cars on the highway in all kinds of terrian conditions.It does not make any difference if you have it on the high power channels or the low power channels.I have a Uniden set that I paid 24.95 at wal-mart and it transmits further than these units also for that price you got a rechargeable unit.
4,Celtic harp at it's best.,"This harp book reveals a little of what excellent advanced masters of the harp, like Riley and McMichael, can etude.Makes great listening, if you can figure it out. Otherwise you have to buy their CDs!"
1,Don't waste your time...,"I just finished this book, and I have to say that I thought it was completely thoughtless and off-track. Crown's portrayal of Marshall leaves something to be desired. The book comes off to me as a quick money-making scheme that's purpose is not to discover the ""real"" Penny Marshall, but to deliver some juicy gossip that will hopefully intrigue the reader. I found the book to be informative on behind-the-scenes Hollywood, as well as on television and film production, but overall it was a complete waste of my time. If you're looking for a personal account of Penny's life/experiences, this is not the book for you."
2,"Shlemiel, Shlamazel","This is a book that needs to be read as a companion piece to her brother Garry's autobiography In fact, you learn from this book that she had a big ego, very little formal training in acting, and a body of work that lent itself better to television than the movies. She got lucky with having her brother give her a major foot in the door to her profession as well as making two movies that did well at the box office, if not great works of art. These are points that Garry seems to also concur.."
4,NOT THE BEST - BUT GOOD,"As far as ""popular history"" goes, this one is not bad. There are certainly better books addressing the life of this fascinating person (Dallek's work and Caro's work comes to mind), but for those interested in LBJ, this is a very good start. The book is well researched, and while you may disagree with some of the author's ""cause and effect scenarios,"" they are logical and do give food for thought. Some of her assertions certainly make mroe sense than many I have read. This work is not as detailed as I like (that is just me), but does cover quite a lot of gound in a very readable form. This book has been in publication for sometime now, but it is still well worth adding to your LBJ collection if you have not already done so. Very much recommend this one."
2,Psycho-Biography,"This was the first (and as of yet, only) book by Ms. Goodwin that I have read. Having seen her many times on television, I expected a somewhat deep historical perspective. By the time I was 25% through the book, I wasn't sure if Ms. Goodwin was a professor of history or psychology. She jumped to an extreme amount of conclusions about LBJ's thoughts and motivations, all based upon her ""unique"" ability to delve into the deeper LBJ through her amateur psychological training. The parts of the book I found most interesting were LBJ's monologues, during which you could listen to the man's self doubt and frustration. But most of the book read like a doctoral thesis from a young psychology major. After a while, it got very boring."
2,Dull,"I am (was?) a great admirer of Doris Kearns Goodwin's work. ""No Ordinary Time"" was a masterpiece of historical writing. But this early biography of Johnson just doesn't stand the test of time. It's MUCH too theoretical and lacks narrative drive. Johnson was an immensely interesting figure. It says everything that this book makes him dull."
4,Good LBJ biography,"I liked this book and learned alot about 'the man' LBJ that I did not know. Is it over analyized from a 'psychology' standpoint - I dont know. I think it is important to understand the inner workings of a persons mind - even from that persons early childhood - to fully understand how a person will act later in life, especially in very difficult situations.BTW I did not see anyone write in their review that this book was originally published in 1976 - only 3 years after LBJs death. Im not sure if the 1991 edition is revised. Interesting as well in the original 1976 edition the author has her name as Doris Kearns (not not Doris Kearns Goodwin) although she was already married to Goodwin."
2,Failing the Dreamer,Biography fails to adequately explain how the Senate Master failed at being the Second JFK. [LBJ was gigantic enough to fit his own mold. He didn't need to impress JFK's coterie of advisers who loved to snicker at LBJ.] ..... Otherwise some interesting facts and minor incisive perceptions are interesting.
3,Lyndon Johnson's political side,"I was disappointed in the lack of more information on his personal life (marriage, family, support network). No mention was made on the work he did to bring electricity to rural Texas during the 1930's or his impact on social services in the 1960's."
3,Tedious but Interesting,This book doesn't have the grasp of Goodwin's other historical books but it is worthwhile. I learned much about Johnson that I did not know and have come to appreciate him much more than I ever did while he was president and later.
2,Goodwin and the American Dream,"I wanted to like this book. Goodwin is a respected author (Pulitzer Prize winner, etc). But I didn't enjoy her writing style. Her tone is arrogant. She repeatedly psychoanalyzes - or, rather, psychoBABBLEizes - LBJ. Too often, her subject matter is herself - HER thoughts, HER feelings, HER background. Who cares about her? This book is supposed to be about LBJ. What was Goodwin ever the President of? The President of boring, if you ask me."
3,Too Psychological,"This book by Doris Kearns Goodwin has too much of one thing and not enough of a couple of things. This book has too much psychoanalysis, relating every decision Johnson made back to his childhood, or his parents. One thing this book lacks is interesting stories. LBJ was probably the most colorful President in history, yet this book depicts him much differently. Finally this book lacks a lot of information about his time in the Senate. LBJ was a much more successful senator than president, yet this book flies through the Senate years. The stuff about the Presidency is great though and you do understand this man better after reading this book."
3,"An OK biography of your typical arrogant, ambitious pol.","This book only gave me a lesser view of LBJ because of the worldly tactics that left him a pretty shallow and defeated man at the end of his life. Doris Kearns Goodwin did a good job of showing us the ""inner man"" of LBJ - insecure, people pleaser, ambitious, and vain."
2,Not as Good as Other Johnson Biographies,Remember this: Just because one is first does not mean one is the best. Kearns Goodwin's book has nothing on the Robert Caro books or the penetrating study Jeff Shesol did on Johnson and Kennedy's rivalry.
1,A puff piece.,"By a former aid who still has stars in her eyes.The good news is most of Johnson's women have other ways to make a living than shilling for his reputation, and if you can believe it, her own."
1,BOOOORRRRRIIIINNNNNGGGG!!!!,"Dull, dull, dull.This author spends so much time babbling about the inner workings of LBJ's mind, you'd think she was his therapist.Not a serious historial work."
5,Spectacular collection!!,"I have several complete versions of each of these operas (and many more)with Corelli. I usually like my operas whole, but I can see the value of this compilation collecting some of the spectacular moments. And I did see Franco live in Tosca and heard the incredible Vittoria and E lucevan le Stelle. Notes I will remember when I die. Along with Sutherlands 1960 Lucia I saw live......I got a bit of heaven on this earth."
4,Lojack,"The DW788R was supposed to be Factory Reconditioned, meaning it has everything just like a new one. Well this one wasn't. One of the thum screws for holding the blade in was not long enough and the blade could not be tightened. To fix it I drove over to Glendale (about 30 miles) and was lucky enough to find the exact part I needed ($9.50). I had also called DEWALT Service department and they sent out two thumscrews. The machine is back in order and it looks good."
1,Horrible!,The ring is much smaller than what I anticipated. It doesn't resemble the photo at all. The color is completely off. I was very disappointed when I received the product.
4,It's good to be an anti-hero,"I LOVED this game. I haven't enjoyed a game this much since Neverwinter Nights! Now, I'm the sort who enjoys RPG's with good plot and drama. I'm not that into hack n slash. Admittedly, there was a fair share of that in this game, but there was plenty of comedy and innuendo for me to sufficiently enjoy myself.I've read a few other reviews, and I agree with the complaint that the overhead view was rather awkward and I would've prefered something more straight on. Someone else mentioned that this is more of a guy's game, and I have to disagree. Well, perhaps he's right and I'm just in the minority. As a female, I found myself with a bit of a crush on the Bard by the end. Of course, Cary Elwes's voice acting may have contributed to this fact, and my inexplicable, unrequited desire to hear the Bard yell, ""To the pain!"" just one time. Oh well.I was very sad to have completed this so quickly. I really wanted more. I want more of this game. I want more games like this one."
4,Not just your typical RPG Game,"I borrowed Bard's Tale from a friend, and after I heard the drunk guys singing in the bar at the beginning of the game I returned the game to him and bought it the next day. From that point on I knew this game wasn't going to be your typical hack and slash RPG game. Even though there's plenty of sword slinging there's also a great dialogue. The graphics are pretty much typical but the voice acting on this is great. Besides all of that another thing I liked about this game is that it isn't that frustrating. It doesn't take a genius to beat this game so if you're looking for a major challenge than you're not going to find it here. This game is definately worth getting just for the story and dialogue, highly recommended."
3,"Very fun and entertaining game, but....","I had a blast playing this game, but there were several points where I got stuck in the clipping and had to reset the game and as luck would have it, I was far from the save books.Other than these issues, it was a very fun game.I wasn't able to finish it though because of the clipping snags.UPDATE: The clipping issues must have been the copy I had. I purchased the game and played again and it worked flawlessly."
3,Good story sullied by a fluffy ending.,"Before I start, I will say that overall it is an okay game and worth the cash I paid for it. The story is similar to most rpgs where you have to save something or someone but main character makes it interesting. The Bard is almost an anti-hero which is refreshing because you don't see a lot of that. The controls were easy to use and once the story gets going to really gets going. What brings the game down is the ending. I won't give it away or anything but it could have definitely been better. It was almost like the designers were rushing in the end and just slapped the ending on, boxed it up and shipped it out.Be this as it may, the journey isn't about the destination it's all about the trip to the destination. In this light the game is worth it because even if the ending isn't stellar the trip there will make it worth it."
5,"Great Comedy, standard gameplay","If you've enjoyed hack'n'slash games of the past, you are going to love this comedic twist on the genre.Bard's Tale takes the tried and true principles of hack'n'slash gameplay (top down perspective action rpg) and gives it life with great comedy. They lampoon all the classic rpg cliches. And with the voice of Cary Elwes (from the Princess Bride and Men in Tights) and Tony Jay, the voice dialogue is perfectly executed.The gameplay can get boring at times, a downfall for this style of game as it becomes very repetitive. But unlike similar games in the genre, this one does give you a reason to keep playing, the excellent story.I would definitely make sure you are TEEN, as suggested by the ESRB rating. Some of the comedy is sexually suggestive. But nothing blatantly over the top. If you want a fun game that doesn't take itself to seriously, this game is a breath of fresh air!"
4,great rp game,This is an older rp game but it is still a goody. This game has a since of humor and is enjoyable to play.
4,Pretty good DVD,"This is a pretty good cartoon series,and I'm glad it was released onto DVD.However,I do have a few gripes:""Jazz Has""-the WORST Jem song ever!This song has NO melody and is just a bunch of noise.""The Jazz Player""-An episode that really did'nt need to be made.All the Holograms did was waste the whole episode trying to get a washed-up jazz band from the 40s back together.""Alone Again""-I feel that this was made just to have ""Jem"" jump on to the anti-drug band wagon.The story intended to be good and teach a lesson,but it failed by being TOO preachy.If you want a GOOD anti-drug cartoon,watch ""Cartoon All-stars to the Rescue"",the anti-drug episode of the cartoon ""C.O.p.S"" or the anti-drug episode of ""Pup named Scooby-Doo""-those were handled beautifully without being too preachy.The other episodes are really terrific,however,and make up for the boring ""Jazz Player"" and carbon-copy ""Alone Again""."
3,Good news!,"Instead of wasting your money on this item, why not wait a few months and get the entire series on DVD. The entire set is being released by Hasbro in October. The wait is finally over."
1,Shame on Rhino for not completing the series,"I have actually purchased the first two dvds in this set, mainly because it stated ""The Complete Series"". Needless to say I was very upset when I saw that it was not and I was missing almost 30 episodes. I was able to complete the series by other means, but I give Rhino a F for not releasing everything when they had the chance. Now I see this Season 3 set which is still not complete. Don't waste your money on this set which is overpriced and not whole."
5,Jem Party,"WOOOOOOOO!! All I can say is THANK YOU!!!! I feel another Jem Party coming on. Although I love all of Jem's epsiodes, I must say the episodes with Raya and Jetta are my favorite. Keep them coming Rhino. Jem is finally back. You must add this DVD to your collection. I cannot wait for the remaining 20. I have a feeling Rhino will release them during the Holidays and if so, an excellent gift."
4,Deeply Interesting,"I met Ayya Khema a number of times and found an extraordinarily strong & uncompromising personality, one incidentally I didn't like at all. I have never met anyone who felt ambiguous about her, it seems we either ""loved her or loathed her"" This book gives a lot of information on how that personality was formed. She tells it as it was, no sense of anything other than someone simply saying ""I began my journey here and this is what happened along the way"". It is the commonality of her journey, all of us Westerners are making a similar if much less dramatic journey to Ayya Khema, that makes this a book a worthwhile read."
4,adventure story,"What an amazing life! I really enjoyed reading about her epic journeys thru the amazon and the middle east, and her inspiring courage with family and danger. I am also interested in learning more about the meditative absorptions after reading her description of them."
5,Complete mastery,Buy this if you are even thinking about picking up a Coltrane CD. Coltrane's range and intensity on this demonstrate what can result when a man becomes a perfect musician in complete control of his instrument. His eastern influenced runs are endlessly inventive and after 100's of listenings I still get blown away and discover something new in this. McCoy Tyner's voicings are equally incredible. If this was Tyner's record with a different horn player it would still be worth owning for his playing on this is stunning. Everything I just wrote pertains to ONLY the title track.....the rest of this CD is as wonderful. This is a highpoint in jazz recording and a must own for anyone who enjoys this style of music.
3,Tilting toward easy listening,"Virtuosity that tilts toward easy listeningJohn's Coltrane's genius and inventiveness are on display on this album of public favorites, though little of his edginess. The format is easy-listening four-piece jazz -- sax, drums, keyboard and bass -- and is unlikely to offend or challenge even those unfamiliar with the genre. At least as amazing as Coltrane's wild improvisational flights are pianist McCoy Tyner's rapid fire runs up and down the keys.Not groundbreaking, but there's ear-catching virtuosity here if you're really listeing. Aand not a bad choice for background music at the office or a party."
3,BUYER BEWARE !!!,"BEWARE; this offering is deceptive. I'm sure Amazon isn't attempting to mislead people, but the fact is all these glowing reviews you are reading ARE NOT FOR THIS ALBUM. They are for the original Atlantic Records album, called ""My Favorite Things"" which, except for the title cut. has completely different songs on it. The original album is a timeless classic which completely deserves all the praise heaped on it, but the album they are offering here looks like a cheaper bootleg - there are many bootleg Coltrane albums on the market with these low-tech looking graphics and poor sound quality. I'm not saying this one is bad...I have never heard it - but the point is, most of these reviewers have never heard it either. You are totally buying this at your own risk."
5,I like this!,"I was first exposed to Coltrane's later avant-garde work, like A Love Supreme, the weird Selflessness and the sonic nightmares Om and Ascesion, but then I got a copy of My Favorite Things, a song from a musical I HATE w/ a passion (The Sound of Music). Coltrane's version of the song is much better than the original one, because it omits the goofy and pretentious lyrics, added Eastern flavored styles to jazz and Coltrane and his band mates reworked it in an unusual but interesting time signature (6/4 I believe). Plus the solos by Coltrane on the song are absolutely amazing. The entire 10+ minutes of the track keep you interested and satisfied. The other 3 songs on this album are awesome as well. My Favorite Things may be Coltrane at his most accessible, but it certainly will appeal to more people than his later works, and is an esential to any jazz collection, or any CD collection, just like A Love Supreme or Miles Davis' Kind of Blue."
5,Essential,"Perhaps the closest analogue this record has in modern-day pop is Radiohead's OK Computer. Like that album, John Coltrane's My Favorite Things was both a commercial success and artistic leap forward.Recorded in just a few days in 1960 (though not released until the following year), My Favorite Things was Trane's breakthrough as a leader. He simultaneously established the core of his great '60s quartet (with pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones), defined a signature sound (lengthy, articulate solos and his trademark soprano sax work) and also notched a radio hit with an edited version of the title track.Gallons of ink have been spilled extolling the importance of this record in the evolution of Coltrane's career and the development of modal jazz. It's melodic, accessible nature makes it one of the most popular post-bop records and many people's introduction to both Coltrane and modern jazz."
4,"A landmark in jazz, but...","Compared to the other Coltrane recordings I have, this one seems to fall short of the mark. While the title cut is adventurous, has some impassioned sax playing, and has a beautiful rhythmic flow, it seems that McCoy Tyner (who, incidentally, is one of my favorites) spends his entire solo section trying to figure out what to play, killing time by plinking some octaves, or vamping while waiting for Coltrane to come back in, which doesn't happen for too long a time. Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye is a beautiful first-rate rendition of a standard ballad, and Summertime and But Not For Me are very enjoyable uptempo pieces. Try as I might, I still feel like I'm waiting for something to happen when listening to the title cut. Maybe I'll get it a few months down the road."
5,Grounded in Truth and Power!,"I loved every word. Pat presents the power of faith with the wisdom of life experience and the foundation of scripture. The personal stories gave me chills, even tears! I highly recommend reading this book with an open heart, and a hunger to experience a living GOD. I only wish it was longer!"
4,Easy writing on difficult subjet,"Just to kill time, I casually opened 'Miracles Can Be Yours Today' and read two chapters in the middle of the book. What a revelation! After 13 years of bible-studies in full gospel institutions, I have discovered yet another level of the concept of Faith. This book is a life changing instrument. Pat Robertson is a wealth of spiritual experience. He communicates seemingly unatainable concepts in a naively simple manner. Thanks"
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"Absolutely wonderful & encouraging. I just finished reading the last few pages & I am so in awe & praise to our Heavenly Father for putting it in the heart of Pat Roberston to write this book. I just want to bask in God's loving spirit & say ""Here am I"" Yes, Lord use me for your glory."
1,Nut Job,"Crazy, Crazy, Crazy.Someone who uses religon like he does for personal gain should be thrown in jailIf he believes half of his psycobabble, he should be thrown in a loony farm."
2,It's a miracle I got through this,"I realize that i take my life into my own hands in writing a poor review of Pat Robertson's book. If God doesn't strike me down, Pat Robertson might implore the US to take care of me.The first star is by defaultThe second for Robertson's sheer audacityHocus Pocus"
1,For Simple Minds,"If you are already a Pat Robertson type Christian looking for a warm and fuzzy then this book is for you, if you are looking for substantive and meaningful reading then save your money.Good grief !!!!! This is the same Crack-pot that claims that god talks to him.Reports have shown that ""Predicting events for the coming year is an annual tradition for Robertson.""In May, Robertson said God told him that storms and possibly a tsunami were to crash into America's coastline in 2006. Even though the U.S. was not hit with a tsunami, Robertson on Tuesday cited last spring's heavy rains and flooding in New England as partly fulfilling the prediction.""I have a relatively good track record,"" he said. ""Sometimes I miss.""What dose it mean ""sometimes I miss"" didn't he assert that god was talking to him??? It must have been a bad connection.There is no way anyone can make Pat Robertson look worse than he already does to himself."
5,God STILL DOES work miracles!,"This book was amazing and a true blessing!! I've been a Christian for a long time, but was never taught the principles in God's word about healing and miracles. Because of this book, mine and my husband's faith was boosted beyond what it's ever been, and we've seen a miracle in our own lives (healing of his cancer). God bless Pat Robertson for the way the Lord uses him to minister to a hurting world!"
4,Easy and fun - effective pronunciation of words.,"My daughter loves the program and is using it extensively. Although much cheaper than some other competitors, we are VERY happy with it."
5,Best Kid's video about travel and NYC!,"My two-year old son has adored this video for over a year and I love the music too! This is a great introduction for kids travelling anywhere and especially for kids who will be travelling to New York City. The music is beautifully written and catchy enough that I find myself singing along every time. Newt the newt is a fun character and the kids in the video are sweet. I love this video, but my son loves it even more. He often asks for ""Newt, Newt""!I have to say that the person who reviewed this video previously has gotten really mixed up and must have ordered the wrong video. It's also really out of date and should be removed. I give this video 5 stars for being parent and kid friendly and having the best music of any kids video I've ever seen!"
1,"Never Lost, just rightfully forgotten","This lecture was *not* part of the course that became the great ""Feyman Lectures"" textbooks. It was given the next year as a filler to another class. Feyman derived this geometric proof of eliptical orbits based on scattering work by Fano, but the postscript says the same proof goes back to Hamilton. It's of some interest to hear Feynman answering students questions at the end. But based on their questions it's clear he didn't do a great job even if you could see the blackboard. So, really, you should only buy this book if you want to learn the proof as presented by the authors. If you can get ahold of his Messinger lectures they're much more well organized and more entertaining, and cover the basics of planetary motion (equal areas/time, and the period/radius relationship) but not the orbits being eliptical. There was almost no humor in this lecture. I was disappointed."
3,a legitamite review,"this cd presents a vauge representaion and tribute to bright eyes. the tracks with exception to ""the calender hung itself"" don't seem to resemble to actual bright eyes songs too well. ""the calender.."" though, is performed beautifully. in regards to the review by ""fox in the hole"" i think that the album art simply shows a boy rubbing his eyes in the morning rather than crying, and i disagree with your schpeel about not understanding or appreciating conor's music by listening to this cd, a little extreme."
2,eh.,"I love Bright Eyes, which is obviously why I took the time to give this a listen. I am also a huge fan of violin and cello. But I am extremely disappointed with this cd. It reminds me of those midi ringtones the older cell phones used to have. If you are a fan of bright eyes and feel you NEED to own EVERYTHING related with conor (because ""OMG CONOR IS HAWT!!1! OH AND SOOO TALENTED TOO!!1""), then go ahead and waste your money on this. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of my love for string instruments. Oh, the audio quality isn't really good either.Also, if you own 1 or 2 bright eyes albums, and are thinking of buying this, DO NOT! Just buy another bright eyes album instead. It is FAR more worth it."
5,Unbelievable...,"This hat rack was really unbelievable. The price was incredibly low, the item shipped within a couple days, and the rack itself was hilariously easy to assemble. The cherry finish is very appealing (if a little uneven) and the top revolves."
4,Solid. Attractive.,Quality product at very reasonable price. I load it down with various pieces of apparel including heavy coats and loaded backpacks! Well balanced and strong.
4,great buy,looks good and easy to assemble. arrived on time would recommed to anyone looking for and hat or coat rack
2,Good while it lasted...,"Great looking coat rack that worked great for a few months. I was sad to see one morning that one of the supporting legs broke. I don't know what the specs are on weight, but it wasn't a whole lot. Would probably work great for a couple items, but don't over do it."
2,not study at all,not sturdy when hanging coats on it it wobbles...will not recommend this product and to top it off it fell over and one of the handles broke off
3,Great while it lasted,This is a good coat rack if you do not have a lot of coats to put on it. It broke after 4 months of use and I had to throw it out
1,The Base Snapped Almost Instantly,"This rack has a great look to it but the quality of the wood that holds the legs in place at the base is extremely poor. It splintered while I was in the process of setting it up which means the leg no longer slides into the base. Also, the three pieces that screw together to form the upright pole do not have a flush fit. I will be seeking a replacement part."
3,Does its job,"This came with a crack in the wood. Did not want to take time to send back , so glued and made it work for what I needed."
1,"Cheap, poor quality","I was excited when I read the reviews about this product stating it was a durable coat rack. The price seemed too good to believe. The product arrived very quickly and was super easy to assemble, but broke within an hour of putting it up when my cat knocked it over. The entire coat rack split in half just from being knocked over by a cat. Amazingly cheap quality. I'm so disappointed that I spent $15 + shipping on this item and didn't even get to use it."
5,"Great looking, high quality chess piece!","While I bought this for myself, I would certainly have no doubt giving this gift to my friends who are avid chess players (and professional engineers with high standards for what is and is not quality material)!Worth your money. NOTE: the pieces are not perfect, a few of the white marble pieces seem to have irregular coloring or even small- to medium-sized cracks. However, this is just part of the the look of the natural stone. The imperfections, I think, make the pieces look even more handmade and artisan-made, instead of that mass produced factory look."
5,Fantastic Customer Service,"I ended up receiving my Onyx and Marble chess set with a chip in one of the pieces due to shipping. I called up Novica and their customer service was fantastic. I talked to a service rep quickly, who gave me instructions on how to return the item. I was able to get a full refund - no questions asked, even though it shipped from Mexico! Additionally, when I was returning the item, I also mixed up another amazon return that got sent to Novica. What would normally be a disastrous situation to resolve couldn't have been easier when they offered to personally reship the item to amazon so that I could get a return on that one too. Best customer service experience I have had in a while."
3,Summer read,"Its good, but not all its cut out to be. Easy to read, moderatelly interesting, but sort of predictable. I wouldn't call it a page turner, but its entertaining enough"
3,too biblical,"I HAVE READ NUMEROUS BOOKS ON THIS SUBJECT, AND I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS BASED SOLELY ON BIBLICAL SCRIPTURES. I REALIZE THAT HEAVEN IS A BIBLICAL SUBJECT, BUT I HAD HOPED FOR A MORE LAYMAN'S VIEW OF THE MATTER. I FELT THAT IT WAS JUST RECITING SCRIPTURE AND THEN THE AUTHOR'S INTREPRETATION OF THE SCRIPTURE. THE TITLE LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT HEAVEN WOULD BE ANSWERED IN LANGUAGE THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON COULD UNDERSTAND. I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT HEAVEN IS ACTUALLY LIKE RATHER THAN JUST WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT IT. I COULD HAVE READ THAT IN THE BIBLE WITHOUT READING THIS BOOK."
1,don't buy these headphones!!!!!,"if you are going to use these for exercising, don't buy these!!!! The around ear portion is insecurely attached to the speaker portion, and the connection breaks after maybe a month of use at most, rendering them unusable!! I repeat, don't buy these!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend the Philips SHS3200/37 Flexible Earhook w/ Bud instead. I got them after these broke, and I love them"
1,not comfortable,"I bought these for running. They are painful, heavy, and dont stay in. They are also difficult to put on. I would not recommend buying these."
3,Funky,"I say funky because it's functional, yet clunky. They work. The sound is decent. But I bought them for working out, they're ""sportclips."" I cannot run/jog with them in. They're too big and heavy and naturally just fall out of my ears. I will need to use them for something else."
2,bulky,"I guess there are worse headphones out there, but not what i was looking for at all. These are very bulky and will not work while hiking/running. Might be ok if you want to look like you had old timey hearing aids in but not for a normal person and normal wear."
5,Awesome,"Pros: Extremely comfortable, They stay on my ears. Normal earbuds always hurt my ears, but these ones are great.Cons: Need to take care of ear clips so they don't break off, my first pair broke off after 3 years and i glued them back. Year later the sound stopped in one ear. no inline volume control..."
1,don't waste your money,I thought this product would allow me to listen to great music while running. The design does not work and I wonder who tested it. I can't get the headphones to staying in place while I'm sitting still. Complete waste of money and time.
1,Horrible!,"I would rank this product as one of the worst products ever made!These ones are supposed to be in-ear earbuds, but they are shaped like outside-of-ear earbuds!This means that it would hurt enormously if you would actually put them inside your ear!Don't buy them, is my recommendation!"
2,The Benefits of Hammered Lead?,"I have to say that I was disappointed in this book. Toxic materials are given a lot more play than they deserve in the text (lead, mercury, etc.). This book is dated and shows it age (when atomic fission-powered planes were thought to be a good idea). Sure, basic sculpture techniques haven't changed much since that late 1940s, but materials have, and in a big way. This book should either be updated or characterized as art history. I think I will trade this bit of history in at the used bookstore for something a little more up-to-date."
4,detailed,It is a detailed book that gives an overview of different mediums of sculpting. Helpful facts on procedure and properties of the different raw materials used in the processes.
3,Tangerine Dream - 'Alpha Centauri' (Castle),"Originally released in 1971,as 'Alpha...' was the band's second album.Tangerine Dream has all too often been tagged as 'krautrock',but I thought they were more like electronic progressive.""Sunrise In The Third System"" featured some nicely done organ work as ""Fly And Collision"" had some good mellotron vibes going for it.The title cut,twenty-two minute ""Alpha Centauri"" employed some way-out-there sound effects,synth and flute improvisation.Of course,the original line-up is here,Edgar Froese-guitar&mellotron,Christopher Franke-keyboards and Steve Schroeder-organ."
5,In Search of Ancient Oregon,"I have shown this book to many of my friends, and they all are amazed as I am as to how easy it was to read, and the photography was without a doubt a real plus! I would reccomend it to anyone with an interest in how Oregon was conceived and developed."
5,"Wonderful, beautiful book","This book is beautifully illustrated and well written, making it easy to grasp the geological concepts. I feel like I found a treasure. I have lived in Oregon all of my life. Now I am looking at the view of the mountains and river valleys--as well as that pile of ""pretty"" rocks in my yard-- with new eyes..."
5,Easily understandable: A good read and glorious pictures.,"This is a great, very-non-technical book that describes Oregon's geology and its past climates and plants and animals in a way that the general reader can easily understand. I bought a copy to give to my brother (a wetland specialist) but ended up keeping that copy for myself. The photos of Oregon's mountains, coast, and deserts are outstanding. It's a great read, and links the history of landscapes and climates here to changes around the globe. A great book to help understand Oregon's landscapes."
4,great gift - surprisingly interesting!,"I gave this book to my husband, at his request. He's an engineer, so I figured that this would be a book that interested similar minds. :) It turns out to be really facinating - our extended family and friends have enjoyed sharing it, and the photos are beautiful and interesting for all ages. My only wish is that it still was easy to find in hardback, as I think that would be nice.The book is written ""story-style,"" which makes the information a lot more palatable to those who don't have a geology background. The historical and environmental perspectives are woven together with very thoughtful writing. There is a lot of data in this book, but I don't think it reads like a textbook, which is nice.Overall, this is a great book. It makes a wonderful gift for just about anyone who appreciates the environment or anyone who has an interest in understanding the land formations they see or live on."
5,Fascinating and beautiful book,"If you have an interest in the geology and natural history of the Oregon region, this is a fascinating and well written book. It's easy to follow and has beautiful photographic illustrations of the material."
3,Cold War--to a certain degree,"The cartoons here ARE from the Cold War era, but hardly add up to ""political paranoia."" In fact, these short films are pretty standard fare, nothing that really demonstrates anything other than a basic mentality of the Cold War. Disk 1 will be of most interest--a short film from 1947 celebrating American moderation and the avoidance of fanaticism; an educational film on Communism and 1940s/1950s events that represented the Cold War's growth, and a ""newsmagazine of the screen"" on political events in 1954. Disk 2 will be of less interest; a film from Harding College, a Church of Christ college with an active anti-communist publication arm, one on television which barely touches the Cold War, and one other.Best to save your money and find something that's more direct and interesting."
5,great buy,"Bought this shoe after looking for other adidas running shoes, and was not disappointed. The 1.1 was everything I was looking for. The silver and green look great and the shoe is very comfortable. Amazon had the shoe at $150 off, what a great buy."
2,Singers overcome by audience,"There is no quibbling with the excellence of this cast. The Metropolitan assembled the greatest singers in the prime of their careers. Pavarotti, Sutherland, and Milnes are the golden trio and sing gloriously throughout. Von Stade has a very small part; but for someone who loves her voice (as I do), this should have been a notch in my belt in my attempts to collect her entire discography. However, the consumptive Violetta must have been in the audience if the amount of coughing caught on the tape is any indication. It is a shame to have to listen to all of these hackers as the cast spins their magic vocally. It absolutely ruins the recording, surely someone's best effort at pirating. Even the magic of the vocalists couldn't overcome this annoying audience."
1,Not again,"Just to make sure it wasn't just that book, I did order two and have come to the conclusion that they both suck equally as much. For anyone that is looking to get some insight and good stories on fighting fire out west, about the only decent book I've read so far is Jumping Fire."
5,My 4 year old can't get enough!,"I picked this up this dvd along with a tour book for our upcoming trip to Playa Del Carmen. I really expected to watch it once (for sightseeing ideas) and then put it on ebay. My daughter, who just turned 4, will not part with it. She has watched it over and over again and picks repeatedly over every other favorite t.v. show and movie we own (and she only gets about an hour of t.v. time a day).The dvd is loaded with silly laughs and fun learning for little kids along with real history and practical tips for the grownups. It's definitely helped us define our plans for our week in that part of Mexico. My daughter is as excited as us about our coming trip because she knows what to expect and can't wait to see it for herself!"
5,Classic/fair,"The music on this is classic, as is most of John Coltrane's work. All of the albums he did on Atlantic, from around 1958 to 1960, such asGiant Steps, scale from fantastic to essential, and this is culled from those. None of the Impulse material is here, and that is more than half the stroy.If you want to learn Coltrane, this is like seeing the credits of a movie, not the movie. If you want some great songs, some nice jazz around the house, get this. But for anyone making even the faintest stab at Coltrane, this does not even begin to cover first base."
5,This CD is ALL OF THAT!,"Totally HEAVEN!The late-great John Coltrane just puts me there.McCoy Tyner on ivory,Jimmy Garri- son on upright bass,and time-keepin Elvin Jones on skins."
5,"A couple glaring flaws, but fine listening.","This compilation, like Trane's career, is too short: six tracks and just over forty minutes. That being said, it is loaded with good material. This collection features some good variety considering its length, be they brooding ballads (Naima, Central Park West, Equnoix) or more up-tempo numbers (My Favorite Things, Giant Steps, Cousin Mary) with equal ease. This compilation leans more towards the material from the Giant Steps album--In fact, half of it is contained on that disc.Though I am, as I said before, a big fan of the material on this disc, what's not on it shocks me. Nothing is included from A Love Supreme (I don't own it but have obviously heard of it) or Blue Train (I mean, at least the title track belongs!), and his work with Miles Davis is also a must-own. But the best way to get into Trane is to pick this up, along with The Best of Miles And Coltrane."
5,animal energies,what a fantastic bookit has to be the best books I've ever read.fantastic detail and simple to understand information.a must read for any one.
5,Holy Quran : Complied by Mir Ahmed Ali,"This is an excellent English Translation of the Quran that is a must for any realy sincere student of religion trying to learn about Islam. The translation is easy to understand but still has some old engligh in it that makes it difficult to understand at times. The best part of this Qur'an compared to most others is the commentary and notes that accompy the text. Not only is there notes on the meaning of a verse but also an introduction to the chapter and an introduction to Islam and the Quran in general. This commentary is an excellent source of information and a huge help when trying to understand the enviroment at the time of the verses were reveled and so forth. I only wish this book had a better subject index. But I have found great search engines on the web that allow for searching for a specific subject, word, multiple word, and so forth. ..."
1,Translation,"Translations are numerous of this book. Each vastly different in interpretation. With each interperated version some things remain the same. Child brides, smiting the necks of non believers, submission, calls for jihad, raging war and idol worship. All of which are incompatible with life and America."
2,Description lacking...,"I was looking for a carrying case for my new Vaio. There were no technical or product descriptions, but the title included ""case"". It was advertised as a Sony accessory for my Vaio laptop, and the picture looked like a carrying case. I naturally thought it was what I wanted. In fact, I chose it over a carrying case from Kensington, because I was concerned about a possible compatibility issue buying from another manufacturer. How could I go wrong buying a case expressly listed for my Vaio model from Sony?I'll tell you. This ""case"" is nothing more than a thin wetsuit material slipcover for the laptop to prevent scratches and keep out dust (but it has a nifty Vaio logo for the vain)! (No, it's not waterproof; it's wetsuit material not drysuit.) IT IS A PROTECTIVE SLEEVE; NOT A CARRYING CASE!Bottom line is I was very disappointed that I didn't get what I wanted. I rate ... For those who want a wetsuit for their Vaio, the product's probably a 4 or 5."
4,ART history,"This book covers the time period in art history called, ""constructivism."" This art work includes sculptures that are built rather than cast or carved. If you are looking for something related to education and constructivism, this is not your book. If you want details and information on the art period from 1913-1922, this book is for you!"
3,"Works, but hotkey for switching is annonying",This is simple and small vs a full KVM. Works fine with my two linux PC's. Can tap a button on the monitor to toggle the monitor's source. My main complaint is that a double tap of the left 'cntl' key causes this to switch computers. Very annoying when tab browsing. I often trigger the switch accidently when text editing in my Eclipse IDE.
1,Constantly switches inputs,"Bought this because another review said they were using it with their keyboard and mouse, but it constantly switches ports without me touching the button. I'll be in the middle of typing something and it'll just switch to the other machine. It even does it when my laptop is on standby!"
3,not so bad ... not so good,"advantages-it works-small-not expensive-very simple to use and to install.Disadvantages-the choice of the double tap on the left CTRL button, they could have choice an other button like the print screen button. (sometimes you switch when it is not your purpose)-switch computers with an USB device is like connect and disconnect this device each time you switch computers, thus you have the ""dingdong"" sound (with windows) each time you switch, it is boring (you have to remove this sound).-Since I use it, sometimes my linux doesn't like it because when I shut the linux down, the computer makes a bad sound (""beebeebeebeebeebee"") during 5-6 sec."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY SABRENT'S USB-SSK USB Share Switch,"Under a PC/XP Professional environment, Sabrent's USB-SSK USB share switch DOES NOT WORK!! And to compond Your Frustration, Sabrent's driver/manuals website is Absolutely UnUseable!"
5,Works Perfectly,This device is getting a bad rap and it shouldn't. It works just as described as in the description. I will be ordering a second one very soon.
2,So-so...,I wasn't impressed. There is a lot of repetitive information and I noticed a number of errors...
4,I was on a two month vacation in Mexico...,and I could not put the book down. The importance of my Spanish immersion classes became secondary to the adventures and passion of Tina in Mexico and abroad. Poniatowska successfully gives readers a glimpse into the life of this artist and activist. Poniatowska gives attention to the social and political environment that contributed to Tina's transformation from a goddess to a committed communista who gave her life to the cause.
3,I'm stuck on page 100,"The writing is interesting, but I must admit, I put the book down and started another. A bit of a tough read, I wasn't draw into the book. It just seems a little flat. So many good reviews, maybe I will try to read it again because the story sounds very interesting. Am I alone in this?"
2,Disappointment,"I found that I was not disappointed by any of Herrmann's works, until this one. The first track is good, but much of the others do not sound like the Herrmann I know."
5,"Rob "" The Pink Panther """,This is an excellent performance and recording of one of Bernard Herrmann's finest film scores. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra performs it with such opulent beauty which is characteristic of this great film composer's work. Released by Varese Sarabande which dominate the market on film score recordings have presented this magnificent work in it's entirety using a 20 bit digital format to give one the optimum listening experience. This is one of the best technologies to present any symphonic work and the producers and recording engineers do it beautifully here. I personally have this CD in my library and I recommend it to anyone. MUST HAVE!
2,"Close, but no cigar...","A great soundtrack that deserves a better treatment. If you are really familiar with this score, you'll agree that this version does not do justice to Bernard Herrmann. Many of the cues are off-tempo and downright ponderous (check out cue #19, The Cave).The liveliness that distinguishes this score is virtually lost on John Debney's interpretation. Why wasn't the original soundtrack resurrected? Varese Sarabande did release a CD version of this album about 10 years ago; believe me, it's a magnitude better than this re-recording. I'm sure the master tapes are in the Columbia vaults somewhere (and in stereo!).For a really faithful rendering of a Herrmann score, 'Jason and the Argonauts' conducted by Bruce Broughton, is simply magnificent. He should have done '7th Voyage of Sinbad'. Oh well, maybe next time...."
2,"Bought new, got used one","I bought the pondmaster 02920 as a new item. However, wheni received the shipment, it's a used one. I can clearly seesome minor scratches on the surface. The UV light has somekind of plague at the connector end. Also, the packing wasloose.I am really disappointed with this type of service from amazon."
3,Exspected Better,"This pondmaster UV light is advertised to work on ponds up to 3,000 gal. I installed it with a 1,200 gph pump in a 2,500 gal pond and run in for approximately two weeks with little to no improvement. I then moved the setup to a 1,500 above ground pond where it ran for over 3 weeks before I saw makeable improvement. I would have expected better. The UV lights I have on my savio skimmer would can provide a crystal clear pond in days. I realize they are much bigger but so is the 6,000 pond."
1,ultra vilot light,The light was ok but they don't tell you that you need other parts to go with it and there are no instructions at all. They don't tell you were to place it or how to place it. I was very disappointed with that. Therefore I returned it. The return was not a problem.
3,Interesting,"Being a member of the Nigerian diaspora, I bought this software hoping to get a refresher on Igbo. It was too low level, plus it was very awkward to wathc caucasions mouth the words; but to hear an african actually say the words.If you're looking to learn a few words quick, it should do the trick. For anything more, maybe take a class, or get an advanced book."
2,Doesn't work,"I bought this to learn Igbo along with my son, but I couldn't get it to work right. It had some glitches in the program and was a waste of time and money. I wanted a voice recording of how to sound out the words and vowel sounds. VERY DISAPPOINTED! Nobody to contact rearding the issue. I don't think I will order from outside my country again. I will stick to reading the book instead."
4,Almost as Teague Terrific as Pigsty,"My son Grant just loved Pigsty and The Secret Shortcut. So we purchased Mark Teague's The Lost and Found. The illustrations are just great and having Wendell and Floyd, whom we first read about in Teague's Secret Short Cut, as the main characters made him feel right at home in The Lost and Found. He reminded me that his school's lost and found resembles the one in the book. We really enjoyed the imaginative story. Great read for kids old enough to understand the concept of a Lost and Found. Yet not quite as good as Pigsty or The Secret Shortcut."
3,Who hasn't had to search the lost and found?!!,"I purchased this book for my granddaughter who made a recent search of her school's lost and found. She did not find her jacket and took 2 friends along for the next search, as does the little girl in this story. What an adventure the children have in this story ""falling"" into the lost and found! Fun story!"
4,Beware of RFI,"First off, let me say that I have no problems with this mouse, just with the conditions under which I am using it. I live in an area with high radio frequency interference (RFI). Television reception in my area looks as if there is a running microwave oven sitting on top of the television set. Cable reception is so weakened that the modem is forced to reset and search out a signal every few hours. Speakers constantly hiss and occasionally screech out noise and CB chatter. Not ideal conditions for a device that relies on a consistent radio signal. I cannot at this time write an informative review of this product, so this is just a warning to anyone who is living under the same conditions to buy the corded MX500 instead. It is identical in every way other than having a cord. Also, I would highly recommend buying a pair of Energizer NiMH batteries to take the place of the generic batteries that the MX700 ships with. Name-brand batteries will double the mousing time between recharges."
5,The best mouse i ever used,I have had this mouse for a year and recently something spilled on my desk and i had to replace it. i was considering a new mouse just to change my style. but i couldnt find anything that compared to this mouse. the multi functions to this mouse are very nifty. when browsing web sites or even folders on your computer it makes everything more with ease. has a forward and backward button to change pages. option of a scroll wheel or two up and down buttons also has a cruise control feature wich allows you to just press the button and move your mouse around the whole page. and the fact that this mouse is recharge and wireless and optical. just makes it the best.. and has a base station..
3,Cheap Batteries,"I bought this mouse and allowed it to charge for two days over Christmas. When I got back to my office, the batteries had not charged. I contacted Logitech customer service by e-mail and the response was that the batteries might not be good and I should return it to the store and for a non-defective product.Instead I bought new re-chargeable batteries and now the product works. This is the third Logitech wireless product that I was unable to use on my initial purchase."
2,NOPE!,"My first review on this product was about a week after I purchased it, even then I was not satisfied with the size and ergonomics of the mouse.After a little over a month the number of issues I've been having with it have driven me to purchase the Microsoft Wireless.The bummer is that I'm a pretty avid supporter of Logitechs gaming devices, but a piece of junk is a piece of junk and for the money, that's what this is.First off, the pointer will randomly begin to shake, the buttons get stuck or just don't click unless I press hard and the distance I can take this mouse from the reciever is a joke (4 feet at best).Secondly the programmable features for the individual buttons leave way to much to be desired, the software included with the mouse installs Logitechs own adware on to my hard drive, eating up resources that I would rather allocate to my applications.There are better products for your money than this."
2,Horrible for Gaming,"I thought the desing of the MX700 would be ideal since I already have a cordless keyboard and mouse from Logitech. However, once I started playing video games, the delay was ridiculous. I would press the left mouse button and would either get no reaction or it would stick. When playing a game that requires quick reaction time, it was plain unacceptable. This would be great for regular use and internet surfing, but there are much better options for gaming."
2,"Jerky motion, unusable for Leftys","I love the concept of this mouse, my current mouse (also by Logitech) eats batteries like crazy. There are two problems with this mouse - first, the motion was jerky, it seemed to be trying to do the smart thing and go to hyperlinks and buttons, even when I had the setting turned off. I might have worked more to fix this, except for the second problem - it won't work if you're left handed.If you are left handed, don't bother. The mouse seems to fit into my hand, but because of the different angle at which a left hand holds the mouse, straight up and down became a diagonal line, and straight left and right curved down. I tried to see if it was something I could get used to, and it just isn't, the difference is too large. Unlike other mice I've used, this mouse has absolutely no method of changing how it tracks up and down, left and right, so there is no way to fix it either (confirmed with Technical Support directly)."
2,Maddening garbage,"At first, the MX700 seems like a fantastic mouse, but shortly thereafter, it becomes frustrating enough to throw it against a wall. I have two of them, and they both suffer from recharging problems.I just came back from vacation, the MX7000 sat in the charger for 6 days. It should be full. What do I get? ""Batteries are low in mouse""WTF?? To fix this, one has to either physically remove and reinsert the batteries, or change the wireless channel, which is odd in itself. This is a constant struggle with both of my MX700s.I am sick and tired of fighting with this piece of crap. I have 126 emails to catch up on and I can't use the mouse until it charges now.Do not buy the MX700!"
2,love the mouse but it has a problem,I went and got the combo of the mouse and keyboard the cordless mx duo. the mouse and keyboard are great but the mouse has a major problem. I am on my fourth one and take it back probably every month. My rechargeable batteries keey melting into the mouse when I try to recharge them and yet they don't even charge. The mouse gets so hot it has to sit there a good 20 mins to cool down after it was only on for an hour and yet it did not charge the batteries at all. I don't know if the fact that the computer is never shut off while I am charging it. The docking station stays cool but the mouse heats up and then does not work until the batteries cool and then you have to jam something in there to jar the batteries free and then replace them in again just to get it to work for awhile.
1,Very disappointed,"Add me to the list of unhappy users. Software wouldn't install correctly on my Toshiba Portege tablet. The Logitech software wouldn't remember settings. Unfter uninstalling and then running with standard XP drivers that problem was corrected but not all of the buttons worked. Even those that worked didn't work all on all applications.5 hours and 4 calls to Logitech technical support couldn't correct the problem The techies tried to blame their ""competitor"", Microsoft, and then blamed Toshiba. What's the point of designing a mouse that won't work on an operating system that 95% of the world uses?Very unhappy. Wouldn't buy Logitech again. I'm writng this review using my Toshiba touchpad."
1,Inferior and gives repetive strain injury from extra weight,"I've 18 years PC experience - bought my first AT286 PC for$US 2000. Used this mouse for two weeks and suffered wrist joint pain. Then went back to old light mouse for two weeks - no more pain. And yes I have no athritis problems and do heavy weight lifting. I then re-tried the mouse again and confirmed it has no wear near the precision movement control of standard light weight mouse.I have written a letter to Logitech AUstralia about this who are refunding me the money (email me if you want a copy of letter). All these sites have rave reviews:-what crap these are paid for by the sponsoring companies. I see this same pattern of ""fabolous"" reviews at all large sites. Lies bought with big corporate dollars.This mouse weights many times more than the traditional mouse - how could it be better dodo heads?? Newer is not better."
3,"Girls, be aware! Not a very ""Gilrlie"" mouse....","First of all, I totally misunderstood the word ""cordless"" because I stupidly thought it would mean what it says--no cord, no wire, no nothing attached.Actually, I turned out to be very wrong...it has this bulky cradle(yeah, the one similar to your palm pilot) with bulky cord that you have to connect to your desktop/laptop, as a ""receptor""; which turn out totally ugly and messy (well, as least the overall over matches my laptop, whihc is also silver and black)I would totally imagine that this is an item that your dad or your boyfriend would enjoy because the mouse is bulky and heavy...So why did I decide to keep it instead? Well, I don't wanna go through the trouble of returning it, also, like I mentioned, at least the colors match.Enough of the complaint..."
4,Great Mouse,"This is a very comfortable mouse. It fills the hand thereby making very little effort to click the buttons. Anyone who is on the computer for a long period of time will definitly see the difference. Also the ""hot buttons"" are very convenient. I can access My Computer with just a quick click of one of the extra buttons.Word of advice, do not overcharge the batteries. I did that and needed replacements from the manufacturer. If the batteries do become overcharged, you will notice annoying habbits such as the pointer going crazy and the infarred only works when directly in-front of the detector. You can replace them temporarily with regular alkaline batteries, or just contact the manufacturer for replacements."
2,great while it lasted,"and it lasted only for a yr and half before the laser started jumping around, the charge would not hold, and the tracking became sloppy. not really worth the money you spend on a mouse you want to keep for at least 2 yrs."
2,erratic mouse,"The...Logitech USB Optical Mouse with wire tracks hand movement so much better than this MX700 wireless that I retired the wireless MX700. The MX700's software doesn't allow enough slow speed selections but gives many fast motion speeds that are impractical to use. I've run the MX700 on a Mac under OS 9.1 and on Windows XP with the same poor results. Had the same problem with Microsoft wireless mouse even though tried every driver configuration possible for all mice. The by-wire Optical is the most accurate mouse I've used so I bought one for my Mac and Windows machines. When using the USB port on my Sonnetech add-on board on the MAC computer the Logitech software control is lost, but the click button and good tracking still work, Kensington software, according to Sonnettech support, does work for Kensington mouse products. I've really lost some money on mouse products. Hope my pain helps someone out there."
5,The best cordless optical,I spent a lot of time looking for a replacement for my Kensington mouse. This is it. Nice ergonomics. Great functionality. Completely compatible with MacOS 9 and all of my software.bit
2,After time it has become worse and worse,I bought this mouse over a year ago. Everything seemed great in the beginning. After three months the mouse would not seat properly in it's cradle. I would have to reseat it 8-10 times before the light would start flashing letting you know that it was recharging. I am not being rough with it at all before anybody assumes this.I contacted Logitech about this and they sent me a canned response directly from the manual that didn't even really have anything to do with the problem. Then they stopped answering my emails. After reading on forums that other people were having the same problem I learned to live with it by just changing the batteries.Now after one year the thing has gone haywire all of a sudden and no longer moves smoothly. It moves really slow and the buttons double and triple click for no reason. I have updated the driver with no results. So here I am looking for a new mouse. I guess it will be a MS mouse.
5,Best Cordless Mouse EVER!!!,"Had my fill of Micro$haft cordless Explorer. Took 3 seconds to respond and was absolutely useless for gaming.THIS mouse is way different. No lag whatsoever. You will not know you are using a cordless mouse except for the fact there is the noticable absence of a cord. I have three of them if that is an endorsement. The corded version of this mouse, the MX500 is the same lightning fast mouse, but with a cord. I have 5 of these. Logitech ROCKS!"
5,Great while it lasted,"I have absolutely LOVED this mouse through the years (yes, years. At least 4 that I recall). I've used it for web/graphic design, browsing, gaming, etc. and it's been lovely.Unfortunately, over the last few months I've been having some trouble with it and it's time to replace it. What's happened is that the left-click sometimes simply doesn't work. Often, you have to press down really hard in order for it to actually work.That being said... it has been through two moves and countless hours of my abuse for at LEAST 4 years before it started having trouble. I bought the MX700 desktop and with the keyboard it only cost me $50. Did I mention I got it refurbished? All-in-all, I'd say it's a quality product and I plan on sticking with Logitech for my next desktop set."
5,Good product!,"I love this mice so much, i got that for [money] at [local store]! without any mail in rebate."
3,It works for some...,"I bought this mouse a while ago, and it worked great. However, after about two weeks it told me I needed to recharge it. I had been putting it on the recharger regularly, so needless to say, this irritated me. I did some experimintation, and I discovered that my recharger didn't work, so as a result I burn through batteries rather fast. Other than that it works fine for me."
1,"Horrible battery life, more cords than before!","I've had this mouse about a year and have come to truly hate it. The only reason I'm still using it is cause it's still somewhat serviceable, so I keep forgetting to buy a new one. Anyway, why it's a piece of junk:1. The battery constantly runs out and you have to keep putting it back in the charger. Always just stops working when you're in the middle of something.2. The fact that you have a charger in the first place. See, the mouse itself is cordless, but the charger, which you must keep on your desk as you need it all the time, HAS TWO CORDS - a usb to the computer and an AC cord! I've used battery powered mice that use a usb dongle - now those are truly wireless (and the 2 AAA batteries last 6 months or a year). Or stick to a corded mouse and that way you'll only have one cord, not two!I strongly advise against purchasing this product. Buy a battery-powered mouse that doesn't use a charger."
1,A horrible mouse,"This is the worst mouse I have ever used in my life. It always jumps all over the screen and is very inaccurate. I do not advise buying this mouse at all. I am going to sell mine, and I just purchased it."
4,Great product with a couple of drawbacks,"Great mouse if you and your kids can remember to put it back in the charger when you are done with it.Sucks when your kids leave it off and you go to use it and the battery is dead.I found the cord a little short, maybe 2 feet short, for the charger, not allowing me to put it where I wanted on my desk.Other than that it is great.However, I would probably go wired next time........ actually I would probably go cheapest optical, wired or not."
4,Battery endurance test,Test Scenario:Constant usage from 9am-6pm everyday. Never placed it in its cradle until the batteries were dead.Test Result:Battery that came with the box: 2.5 days (batteries declared dead around noon)Sony batteries: 4 days (batteries found dead on day 5 when I returned to work)Maxell batteries: 4 days (batteries found dead on day 5 when I returned to work)Note:Place the mouse back on its cradle for 15 minutes does give you enough juice for a few extra hours.
5,Well worth the investment,I have had the MX700 for over a year and feel it is the best on the market. I love the fact that it is rechargeable (just stick it in the cradle and it recharges the batteries.) and that it is optical. It works great even if I use it on my lap. I never have reception problems and don't have to worry about an erratic cursor due to a gummed up ball. The MX700 has always worked flawlessly for me would recommend it to anyone.
5,AMAZING,This mouse is heavenly! it is a dream to use. It slips comfortably into my hand and is so precise. Its perfect for gaming. I ve had for 2 months and i still love it. The range is incredible and recharging is a breeze. The only bad thing is that for some games the scrolling doesnt register. Other than that its perfect to use. The Back and Forward buttons used for internet browsing are handy as well.
4,Response to battery concern,"Many users reviewed this unit. Many of them had a concern about the mouse battery tends to wear off completely if not place back into its charging cradle overnite. This is completely true. When I opened the box, I immediately notice the rechargable batteries that came with the unit is cheapo generic unknown brand type. Those batteries looks like those you would find in a 99cents store. I didn't even bother to put them into the mouse. Instead, I replace them with a better known brand (Sony). The result is noticable. Had left my mouse out of the its cradle for a nite, and its still working on the following day."
2,"Cool, but what about software?","The basic mouse functions are great. It has good accuracy, feels good in the hand, it's pretty, and I like the potential of actually using the 6 other controls when Logitech updates their software. I followed the excellent instruction booklet to install this on my Windows 2000 Dell computer, but I was never able to find a way to assign commands to the extra controls. The installed software thought I had a 2 button mouse. I zoomed on over to Logitech's website to look for solutions and downloaded the current version of the mouse software. However, even Logitech's updated software can't recognize anything more than a 2 button mouse. I have since removed all of Logitech's software, sent them an e-mail explaining the problem, and I still have effectively a cute 2 button cordless mouse. I suppose I expected more from top-of-the-line"
3,Mixed review,"I like this mouse for the cordless convenience. The battery life is good, I just have to remember to put it on the cradle overnight every three days or so.What I don't like about this mouse is that after just a few seconds of being idle, a mouse press does not register unless you move the mouse first. If I rest the cursor on a button and don't press it right away, I end up having to wiggle the mouse again before actually registering a click.Other than that, I have no complaints."
5,Great Mouse!!!,"I must say, Im very happy with this mouse. I cannot say however if it is worth the 70 bucks. This is because my friend's mom works at Logitech, so i got this nice mouse for 40. But I am very impressed with it. I am a pretty big gamer, and many ppl say Logitech is bad for gaming. I disagree with this, this mouse works perfectly fine. The extra buttons on it come in handy when i dont want to move my mouse all the way to the top and click back or go to the scrollbar on the right. Its a very smooth mouse and i have never experienced any skips whatsoever. If you are looking for a new mouse, get this one!"
5,GREAT!,"Delivered quickly, everything worked the first time, no set-up issues.... works flawlessly, even with all the other remote controlled devices I have in my house."
5,Excellent control and features,"Describing this mouse requires three words, but they're all good ones:OPTICAL ... no more scraping grit and crud from the innards of your ball mouse.CORDLESS ... finally you can use your mouse further than three or four feet from your machine.RECHARGEABLE ... none of the waste, expense, and hassle that come with a battery-driven cordless mouseAdditionally, the control is excellent and the programmable buttons are nice if you're a power user or compulsive system tweaker. As others have said, the MX700 is ideal for casual use, graphics/image manipulation, programming IDEs, and games of all sorts (and I've used it in all of these applications without complaint). It's not the lightest mouse in the world, but I don't mind that ... it never bothers me even after several hours of work or play.Highly recommended."
4,Best so far,"I've been using that microsoft intelli mouse for about 3 years and have no complaints. This mouse is not as symmetrical as the intelli mouse but it has a rich and silky feel to it.Pros: no wires, rechargeable base, optical, programmable buttons.Cons: the price, does not have program specific option as in the intelli software, sometimes uncomfortable for left handed people."
5,"Great web surfing, multi-tasking mouse.",As a teacher I tend to have several programs open at once. Since your school is fairly heavy into technology most of this is on the web. I found the scrolling and control of this mouse almost as impressive as its funtion buttons. This is definately a tool for the surfer or multi-tasker. The only problem I see is that it takes a little getting use to for people with big hands like I do. After a day or so though it's great. I also like how the receiver and the recharger are all one unit.
5,"Great Wireless, Great Mouse","This mouse is by far the best wireless on the market. The rechargable stand is perfect for eliminating battery changes. The other wireless mice just don't offer it. It has easy-to-use web navigation buttons on the side and Logitech's outstanding software to make it scream. If you are looking to go wireless, you need this mouse!"
4,"Good hardware, lousy software","The mouse itself is precise, comfortable, and the recharging base station is a great convenience. The software, however, is an atrocity. As another reviewer has pointed out, Logitech attempts to have you install a number of advertising programs and other virus-like software. Even the MouseWare software itself is a detriment. In exchange for a battery display added to the Mouse control panel, you get a terrible ""quick switch"" button that I find completely unhelpful--and worse, you completely lose the ability to trigger the Middle Button! Clicking the mousewheel doesn't work, and the ""Middle Button"" setting for the fourth button only brings up the ""quick switch"" menu. Uninstalling the software (eliciting a rude ""you must reset your machine, do not pass go, do not cancel this dialog) and installing just the driver via the Add New Hardware Wizard resulted in normal functionality, but all those absurd hoops shouldn't be there in the first place."
3,"It worked fine, till it died.","I had mine about 16 - 18 months. Worked fine. After extensive checking and playing with it, all I can say is that it up and died. I wish they'd at least give you an idea of how to know that it's dead so that you don't have to waste an afternoon and evening downloading and recharging and playing with wires to see if you can get it to go again."
2,"Almost a great mouse, but one big problem","I love this mouse in every way except one. And unfortunately it is the most important thing. The mouse will work fine about 90% of the time then it just jumps across or up the screen for no reason. I have followed the installation directions and I have it 8 inches away from any electrical device and it is only about 8 inches from the mouse and it still jumps. I would move it even further away from electrical devices, but the cord is too short."
3,"Really Nice Mouse, Still Cords Involved","This is a really nice mouse, great speed, optics, range, feel... But you'll still have cords running to the computer.I've got a laptop and I hate plugging and unplugging cords all the time so I was looking for a truely wireless mouse, this is not it.The base station, which is a reciever and charger, requires a cord from an outlet, then it another cord to the computer. Now, the mouse doesn't have a cord physically attached, but the wires for the base station are enough to turn me off.So buy it if you've got a desktop, but not if you've got a laptop."
5,So glad I ordered this!,"I LOVE my new logitech cordless optical mouse. Our old mouse was really worn out and did not operate properly no matter how we cleaned the little ball, so I took a chance and splurged on an optical mouse. I am so glad I did!The new mouse is fabulous! It is SO comfortable in the hand. There is no ""little ball"" to mess with, get stuck, or need to be cleaned. Also, the batteries are totally rechargable. When not in use it simply slips into its cradle much like a cordless phone. I have been able to mouse for hours before recharging was needed. It recharges in mere minutes, and there is even an LED indicator light to let you know when full power has been restored. As a bonus, there are a few extra buttons that make internet surfing quicker and more efficient. And it looks really cool, too. ;-)In my opinion (and that of both husband and daughter), this mouse was well worth the extra cash (vs. buying a ""standard"" replacement mouse)."
2,"Well executed design, but too heavy","I used to think the mark of a good mouse was a heavy, solid-feeling mouse. For me, this mouse is too heavy. In my opinion, it just takes a little too much effort to move the mouse across the desk. I tried using a mouse pad, and that helped somewhat, but part of the beauty of an optical mouse is that a mouse pad is not a necessity. I know most people have good things to say about this mouse, I'm just really picky about something I use day in and day out."
4,Logitech MX700 Mouse,"Pros:Excellent TrackingNice weight & feel to the mousePlenty of functional buttonsRechargeable, but...Cons:Rechargeable battery only lasts a few days before forcing a recharge. Logitech cordless mice using Alkaline batteries last for months...If you don't remember to place the mouse in the base every night, you might return to find a dead mouse the next day.Some of the new buttons on top are not easy to press without having to take your hand off of the mouse."
1,It killed my laptop,"I have one major warning - DO NOT instal the software on the cd - in fact do not even put the cd in your computer. The mouse itself is pretty ok. Its smooth and comofortable in your hand with some nifty extra buttons. BUT, when i installed the enclosed software it killed the software on my laptop. It broke my virus sheild and replaced my on board mouse setting with its own - permanently!. Had to re-instal a lot of stuff before my on board mouse settings came back. That was just the begining. I am still dealing with the aftermath of this mouse a month later. DO not beleive the box - most of the extra buttons will work without the cd - especially if you are running XP."
2,Logitech installation program froze my computer - BEWARE!,"I have Windows XP, but the installation program for the MX700 froze my computer. After hours on the phone with techs, they told me the only way this mouse would work on my computer would be if I didn't install the features the extra buttons provide. It would be tempting to just return it to the store, but I do like the fact that it's cordless and has a rechargeable base. That's why I'm giving it two stars instead of one."
1,STINK-O-RAMA,"I read many of these stories in the magazines they were originally published in, and it is quite clear they've been EXTENSIVELY edited, some would say rewritten, for this volume -- and NOT for the better.I rated it one star because one can't rate something ZERO stars. If you think you liked the stories in this ... thing, track down the original versions -- I'm sure you'll like them more! (I find it interesting that the editors of this volume didn't include info on exactly what magazine and issue each story came from -- probably didn't WANT people going back and making comparisons...)"
5,"This Polar Bear goes ""woof"" with HUGE recommendation","Four paws up! and woof, woof, woof. Now that all the bear magazines are gone, these collections of stories keep the culture of bear men going. This book is totally not like a book because it's more like a magazine. It has hot stories and hot pictures. The best of both whirls! I'm taking this book with me to Bear Rendevouz in San Francisco where some cub and I can ""read"" to each other in bed, because it always rains. HUGE-ly Recommended!"
5,It's about time for stories and pix from bear magazines,"It's about time that bears get our own book of fiction in this first book--The bear magazine editors who picked these stories and these photographs are the heroes here promoting bear society--The pix the authors took of themselves are good as it's nice to see who actually wrote the bear stories, Simon Sheppard, Jay Neal, Bob Vickery, Shaun Levin, Charles Eldridge--The book-video tie-in (plus the bear magazine photos) chronicles our bearishness as a separate category of male bonding--Plus I got a free video of the bears of the Folsom Street Fair. Waiting for Bear Cult 2, and more bear voices."
5,Good reading,"Very good stories by writers who must be authentic bears to make this book seem so realistic, and funny. If this whole group of bear/writers went out to the woods for a bear weekend, this is what I imagine the campfire tales would sound like. 4 PAWS UP!"
2,Dissapointing,"A coupla copies of First Hand magazine would have been about as satisfying... Considering the 'hype' of this book, I found a few of the stories to be bland at best (one of Furr (aka George Madisons)'s stories has been badly re-edited, causing it to lose its focus...) I found the addition of cheesy photos to be tacky (and don't miss the many paged ads in the back for the publishers videos (featuring all of the pics stars..) to be well not all that welcome.I had real high hopes for this, but I was um...'satisfied' more less than more... Yeah- there *are* some hot, woofy, tales here...but its not worth slogging thru some of the worse ones (considering the list ot authors- I only wondered what *didn't* they use? the mind ... boggles...All in all, this reeked of the 'lets jump on the bear bandwagon' and sell stuff mentality....I want more...and better!!"
1,Coming Unglued,"I bought a pair of these oars for a small rowboat. The blades are glued up from pieces, not a solid board. The glued seams have split from the tips about two inches after 6 months of 2 X per week use. Stored in garage and taken to lake when boat is used. Explore other manufacturers if you want wood or go to National River Supply and try plastic."
2,Too Sensitive and Non-Repairable,"I purchased a NEW Rio Carbon and from the beginning the controls are extremely sensitive. Just brushing against a button will cause a playback to restart or skip. I have to hold it out in front of me by the edges to be sure I can get through a book without having to refind where I was. Got it to use while walking but I can not put in in a carrying bag but have to carefully hold it. Very frustrating.Also the power button is held in place by a thin narrow piece of plastic that flexes each time the Rio is turned on or off. Shortly after the warrenty period was done the plastic broke from repetitive use. Rio will not repair it, but offered to exchange it for a considerable cost. I now use pen or pencil tip to turn it on and off.When it works it is OK but I would not buy another Rio unless the controls were protected from accidental use and there was better quality design and materials."
2,"Great Idea, but not well made","I thought that this was the greatest electronics item since the television- until I dropped it. As another person mentions here, the control buttons are not well placed on the unit, particularly the on/off button. I also now must use a pen tip in order to shut in on and off. I realize that dropping it was my fault. However, it should have been designed to resist a ""light"" fall. I have subsequently purchased another one, because I found one at a very low price. This time, it will not be removed from its case, unless it is absolutely necessary."
1,Poor substitute,"This was my second RIO MP3 player, the first worked fine but had a very limited memory. The carbon worked well for about 1 month. Then an error started to show up which prompted me to 'reinstall' the system to my computer and uplink all the songs again. By the third month the player wouldn't link to the computer at all. After numerous conversations with RIO, they informed me that my player needed to be replaced and offered to send me a replacement for the low low price of $100. As I payed just $150 on sale 3 months ago, I politely (!@$# NO) declined. My IPOD nano works well everytime, is smaller, more user friendly, and has a 1 year warrantee vs. the 90days for the RIO. In otherwords, don't buy the carbon."
1,Non existent customer service,"I purchased a rio carbon player; after an hour of use it went completely dead. I faxed the proof of purchase twice within the warranty period with the understanding that they would respond by phone within four hours. That was several weeks ago, they never contacted me. Now my unit is out of warranty, doesn't turn on, and I can't get in touch with Rio. They have no customer service via email or phone. Very poor indeed."
2,Worked great for 1 month/horrible customer service,"I've owned two previous Rio's that I really liked and were adopted by my kids. I upgraded to the Carbon. It worked great for one month then required that I format the hard drive every time I wanted to add/delete music. By month two the ""permanent"" long life battery was dead. I followed the exact instructions on Rio's website for warranty assistance--THREE times and was completely ignored."
3,"Decent, but not fabulous","This items works well in general and was a good buy for the price range, but doesn't have the perks that other mp3's have. You cannot see all of the songs in the playlist when you have selected a list, but only see them as they play. Also some loose connections at the audio port, making alot of noise when the unit moves, which can be very irritating, especially if you use the unit when exercising/running."
1,RIO Carbon Volume Knob Keep Breaking,"I bought a 5 GB RIO Carbon about 2 years ago. After one year the volume knob broke, so I returned it, paid $100 and got a replacement. About 2 months later the replacement died, so I paid another $100 and got another replacement. Now the third replacement volume knob broke (without any dropping etc.) I wish I never bought a RIO. It has a serious design flaw. Buy an MP3 player with no moving parts. I should have bought an Ipod, as I have now spent far too much money continuously repairing/replacing my RIO. Also not there is no shuffle mode on it either which would have been a nice feature."
1,Complete Garbage X2,I purchased 2 of these for Christmas presents. Both freeze for no reason while loading music. Rio tech support is totally useless. After 45 minutes they said they knew about an issue with some refubs going out un-checked. I will never buy a Rio product again after this mess.
4,Wow! Awesome! (almost),This MP3 player is basically the best you can get the only problem I had was when I droped it and the volume wheel got messed up but other than that it's the best ever!
1,Terrible,"This book is terrible! No one appears to have edited this book. The book has poor grammar, typos, punctuation issues, disjointed phrasing, and inconsistencies. The introduction sounds like the author's personal rant detailing how he thinks parents should choose names.The name information is poorly presented and useless. Common names have numerous and conflicting characteristics. Uncommon names have either no characteristics or just one (often repeated in different forms) drawn from the one historical figure with that name."
4,Jewish Libraries,"Great classification system for libraries of Judaica. Effective for College Hillel libraries, small Jewish libraries and private collections."
1,No Merit,"I found this book to be ""gossippy"" with no merit on an interesting topic. What also bothered me was that this book obviously didn't have a real editor check it - names are spelled incorrectly, lots of misleading comments and plain old wrong facts, etc."
1,Torture,"They strangle your legs, they're too hot and the material and weave are uncomfortably abrasive against to top of your shoe. They actually tire my feet and legs so much that where I was once content to get out of my shoes at the end of a day on my feet, I feel tormented until I can get out of these socks. For now they'll stay filed in the drawer."
5,Gorgeous Hair Accessory!,"I am very pleased with this purchase. It arrived well before the projected date. The quality was better than expected. I feared that it might look cheap and tacky, but it definitely doesn't. I love that the elastic hair band can be removed and replaced if needed."
4,Red hot frame at a cool price.,My husband liked this license frame. It brought out the colors in his plate without looking cheap or gaudy. For under $10 it was worth the price I paid. I would buy again.
5,What are those notes ?,"Being an ex trumpet player, who was able to play Maynard's ""Hey Jude"" , ""MacArthur Park"" and others----even I have to ask ""What are those notes in ""Hot Canary""? Maynard amazed listeners for 60+ years , and this is some of his finest from the earliest period. Considering the age of some of these recordings , the sound is remarkable. Great from the first track to the last !"
2,Disappointing dress from Prada,"I was very disappointed with this dress. It is the most expensive cheaply-made cotton dress I've ever seen, Prada or not. The only thing that was redeeming was the belt, which was cute but not worth paying $80 with the dress. It looks like Prada just slapped its label on a mediocre-quality cotton dress and to see which suckers would buy it. I can find better quality at a better price at Target or any discount retailers. FYI - I also recommend against any Miu Miu pants on the site. Again, the quality is below par compared to mass discount retailers' versions."
1,The worst online fighting game ever.........,"I knew when I got this game that there was something about it despite that I did like the movie. this game really has nothing to do with the movie. the production and the way this game was put together was poor. the graphics, sound, gameplay all factor in why i have generously gave this game 1 star. I figured I didn't like the fighting style of the game and gameplay and desided to go online......... like a ghost town. nobody plays this online?? that's weird that this was just released and nobody uses the online option, could be because people are getting rid of these. stand clear of this game. This is a BIG joke!!!!"
1,Horrible,This Game is horrible i wish i came on here and read other reviews before buying it...Givin the fact i bought i from EBgames for $10 i'd have to say it wasn't even worth that...there's nothing good i can say about this game..Story is very short and easy if you try to play anything else it's the same thing over and over again..They put Fred Durst in this game like He's a bad ass or something...When we all know he's just a lil bitch..i put this game on easy and noticed that the game didn't get easier they only gave me less points for beating people...All and all i can tell you like the rest have..Skip this game not even worth $10
2,WHYeeeeeeeeee!?!,"That was my screeming little girl voice you heard the other night after playing this game. I was excited to see a fight club game coming out! I wanted this to be at least an ok game. Here's whats what. The story mode is too short. The ""make your own fighter"" is extreemly limited. Control is a bit off. They put a nice dent in the movie making this. I hope Chuck P. (The guy that wrote the book befor it was a movie) urinates all over this in a public place for everyone to see. I don't know if he actually cares if this was a failure, so I think I'll take this to a public place and do my thing on it for him. Read the book. Watch the movie. Skip the painful game."
1,First rule of Fight Club.......DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!,"I read all the reviews and thought...""how bad could it be, I mean it's Fight Club"" well, let me put it this way, I only paid $7 for this game and was still pissed and felt like I was ripped off. I hated it so much!!! The moves suck and are way to hard to do, and the game is just real boring...and they sure talk about ""Fight Club"" and ""Project Mayhem"" quite openly (two things they are not supossed to talk about at all). I hope by the time you read this and all the other reviews you take our word and decide not to waste your time or money like we did...If you love the movie, you'll hate the game..."
1,Horrible game from one of the best movies ever...,"I'll make this short and sweet...This game blows from clunky bad controls to the ""obviosly showing"" unfinsished gameplay and desighn. Save your self from playing this garbage..Get the film it's excellent..Lates"
3,Not the best game but it's Fight Club,"OK, this was a sad attempt to make money off of a movie that preached anti-consumerism basically, but it was Fight Club so I had to try it out.The game play isn't that good and the little bit of story sucks so I wouldn't waste your money."
1,dissapointed,"I couldnt be more disheartened, I expected a game where you get to be part of project mayhem or maybe one where you play out the story as tyler-- this game did not deliver on that at all. You fight like eight people and the whole story mode all you do is fight and watch videos. The fighting is no good though, you cant do any combos or anything because either the AI is too quick or the processing is to slow to put it together. I beat this game in a matter of two hours. Dont waste your money."
3,It's worth a rental.,"I bought this game mainly due to the fact that I'm a die hard fan of the movie, the book, and all of Chuck Palahniuk's work. I've never played any other games made by Vivendi.Overall this game is fair at most. There are only 3 fighting styles, and quite a few characters. Each character has one of the 3 fighting styles, which all have the same moves. That gets boring quick.There is a decent amount of levels to play on and quite a few characters, which is a plus. The narrator, Tyler, Raymond K Hessel, Angelface, etc.I think the best part of this game is the bone breaking animations.Like the title says, it's worth a rental. I bought it and I've only played it a handful of times.Fighting game recommendations for ps2: Soul Calibur 2&3, Tekken, Mortal Kombat Armageddon."
4,nice item,nice item with average quality. it would be better if you could see it in person before you buy. but its very good.
4,great stuff,"I got this because I was going to see him. Although if you listen to the whole CD it seems a bit repetive, his lyrics still ring true after alll these years. Highly recomended."
4,I like it. Just as advertised.,"Works well, just as listed on the product page.It's not as good as a laser bar code scanner, but anyone who knows a little about scanners will understand the limitations of this scanner.Personally, I read the description and decided that the product's price was right and it met my needs. What surprised me was that the construction of the scanner was very sturdy for how cheap it was. The electronic components seem very simple (which means less chance of hardware failure) yet work very well. Installation was literally plug and play. Configuration is done by scanning bar codes in the included booklet (for things like making the scanner scan all the time or just when the trigger is pulled, escape characters, beep on successful scan, etc).This probably isn't good to be used as a grocery store checkout scanner, but is perfect and cost effective for any kind of inventory solution, electronic time clock, package tracking, etc."
2,Works but not well,"It does work but not in some conditions, for example it dosn't work in high light conditions like outside. But on the flip side it is the cheapest barcode scanner and in does work 80 % of the time."
5,Great healthy mac and cheese!,"This is THE best mac and cheese on the market. Just try it. Its rich and creamy, and all organic and as healthy cheese and pasta can possibly be.Amazon also has a very reasonable price on this to stock your pantry."
4,Surprisingly good,"I purchased these originally because a friend of mine was lamenting the changes to the ""other"" stuff and how it didn't taste the same. I like attempting to make mine from scratch but doggone it, sometimes I just don't feel like cooking. I saw the reviews and thought why not? I took a leap of faith and got the case. It is super easy to make, the flavor is very good, and I shared it with my friend. She liked it so much I gave her a few boxes.The only downside is that it is a little dry. Not quite enough cheese sauce to make it ooey, gooey like the other stuff used to be like. I add some cheese to ramp up the gooey factor. That being the only downside for me, I love this stuff and will buy it again. Who doesn't like easy after a long day at work, school or whatever?"
4,"Favorite ""comfort food""","Many years ago, used to practically live on good ole Kraft Mac & cheese, but this is SO much better! Great cheese blend, not too salty. The only downside to the new packaging is that it's smaller. I used to get two good sized servings out of the old packaging, now I get 1 and a half, which is NOT very convenient. Still tastes great though!"
5,Best Mac&Cheese In a Box We've Ever Had,"My husband and I are huge fans of Annie's Deluxe Pasta & Cheese. My husband likes the Elbows & Four Cheese variety best. I also like the Rotini and White Cheddar flavor. This is the best boxed mac and cheese we've ever found. We also like that it's all-natural, and not full of preservatives and artificiality. We wish that it were organic, too, but other than that, this is the perfect boxed mac & cheese."
2,Yuck!,"I was really disappointed. It tasted like cardboard and vinegar. It wasn't very satisfying either. It was, however, easy and quick to make."
4,Great Product,"My jewelry used to be in a very cute space which is a miniature of drawes, however they would get mixed up and it would take a long time just to untangle the jewelry. Now, it looks so nicely in the organizer. I can actually see what I have and I save myself lots of time not having to untangle them.Only problem: it came with a little defect, I worked in a way of my favor, just because I did not feel like sending it back."
2,La traduccion de este libro es bastante mala.,"Todavia no he avanzado suficientemente eb el libro como para decir si vale la pena o no. Aparentemente esta bien escrito y es de lectura agil, pero el libro original parece haber sido escrito en ingles y la traduccion al español es terrible. Por ejemplo: En lugar de traducir ""but"" como ""sino"" (cuando las circunstancias lo requieren), la traductora usa siempre el ""pero"". Por ejemplo: ""It wasn't his friend, but his brother"" estaria traducido: ""No era su amigo, pero su hermano"". En otros lugares la traduccion resulta en frases inconclusas. Es realmente una muy mala traduccion al español."
2,Marine Navigation,"Today I decided to read the section on Sextants. Much to my surprise, the first two pages of the section were fine, but the next two were blank. When I turned to the next two, they were printed but the previous two were skipped. The entire chapter on sextant was in this ""pattern"". A little hard to gain any understanding of sextants with this as a source."
5,SIMPLY WONDERFUL,This book came to be very useful and well kept for its edition.This is an amazing place to get cheap books if need be. Thank youso very much!Sophia E. DiGonis
2,Simple designs,"The designs are simple with a two-dimensional quality. For example, most of the floral and animal designs use only two or three colors (in bands from light to dark). Cross Stitchers Oriental Odyssey by Joan Elliott is far superior to this book if you are interested in Asian designs."
2,oriental cross stich,"I ordered this book because this is the only oriental cross stitch book that I found, and waited eagerly to see the designs only to be disappointed. As for someone who is living in Far East, this may not be the book to suit your expectations. For others who love to stitch Asian designs, this may be ok to be added in your collection, but for me, I think it was a big mistake to buy this book. Definitely not a good buy!!!"
4,Celebrating the rich legacy of architecture in Los Angeles,"This is an extraordinary collection of images and information that effectively chronicles Los Angeles' ongoing architectural legacy.The title refers to the achievements already lost (in a physical sense), such as the famous Dodge House, to those that should be or must be recognized as landmarks, including Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House and Ennis-Brown House, as well as the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Greenacres mansion, to The Crystal Cathedral and Union Station. Structures encompassed by a liberal extension of Los Angeles' metro area throughout southern California are also included.Hopefully, future editions of this book will include larger photographs, more color photographs, and a full index for easier reference to the specific contents."
3,I was disappointed.,"L A Lost & Found was a very good resource for the ""history"" of how the City of Angels developed into what it is now. However, if you are looking for a book which shows the awesome beauty of LA's prominent architectural sites - which can take your breath away - this is not the book you want to buy. I found the book akward. The format seems clumsy and lacking. There is no index. The content didn't seem to follow any patterns that were discernable to me. Despite the photos by the revered and excellent Julius Shulman - I just thought this book came up short. It seems to me to be an average sort of book. You might very well have a different take on this book. But I would not recommend it unless you have a full library on LA architecture before buying this one."
4,The past and present of Los Angeles,Sam Hall Kaplan's L.A. Lost and Found: An Architectural History of Los Angeles is a book obviously written about Los Angeles. The book basically brings us through Los Angeles in the past and on to the future. I feel the reason why the book is titled L.A. Lost and Found is because we have lost a lot of L.A. throughout the years but we have also gain a lot. Things that we have lost and gain is basically the landmarks of Los Angeles. As the years gone by we have been much more productive with landmarks and we are forgetting about the older ones. If you are one that wants to know more about the history of Los Angeles this would be a nice book to look through because it has a lot of beautiful colored pictures of the landmarks of Los Angeles.
4,True passion for 10.,Mr. Perez has done it again. His passion and intricate playing style in 5 (or should I say 10) is expressed and stamped all over the album. Percussion adds extra sizzles and sparkles. Must have; a perfect companion after work( with cappuccino ) or whatever the occasion may be.Enjoy.......
2,The Same Album....Again,This sounds like every other latin pianists coming out now. Nothing special. His close harmonies do nothing except annoy.
3,i am looking at the 92 eclipse 1.8 4cylinder,it got some good point but it dose not show a closer lay out on the time mark and on the two oil gear marks at all that the heart of the engine and if it dose not show a good picture of that you will put it back toghter wrong if you got a better picture send it to me so i could see it ok
1,the truth about burnout,"I read this book in my local libary and found it very interesting. It also applies to government which have become infected with consultants and ""reform"" fads. Another good book was ""The Witch Doctors, making sense of management gurus. WE already survived TQM, and now are going throug""reinvention"" which was supposed to be all done in 3 to 5 years. Now 7 1/2 years later it takes 2x the number of people to do half the work in twice the time. This is is causing burnout in a lot of people. I'll buy the book when it comes out in paperback."
5,Awesome,"This has to be the best written textbook that I have read. Mike explains in great detail the point he is trying to get at. With Microsofts version, you do not get a clear view of what they are trying to point out. This textbook is easy to understand and read by not using terms that would go over your head. The exercises are worth doing because you get something out of each one, giving you a clear understanding how Server 2008 works. I recommend this textbook to not only a student, but to administrators that are just beginning to explore Server 2008 and its functions and roles. I look forward to the Second Edition and other books that Mike writes."
1,Do this ... then do this...then do this...,"This is another one of those overpriced Course Technology books which are meant for trade schools and community colleges. The approach is simple: Follow the author's instructions by typing in the required commands, press OK or Enter, and verify the results. You won't really understand what you're doing since the explanations are sparse and you won't be able to apply your knowledge to a general situation. You will only know about the concepts as they pertain to the instructions that the author gives but you will certainly not have any idea how to do anything else."
5,All you need....,as long as you have taken Active Directory...etc all the basics that are required over all this is a good book
1,Do not by the 1st edition,"I purchased this book in non electronic book version for class. Well written with lots of errors. Exercises are poorly researched. You'll waste a lot of time trying to do exercises that are incorrectly configured. Most students in my class felt like giving up on labs. What should have taken 25-30 minutes to accomplish...wouldn't work and required hours of research to find correct procedures. Commands are full of errors. Not worth the money. Wait for the next edition. Half way through semester, we received Errata with about 15 pages of corrections from the author. Stay away from this book! Wait til they get it right."
2,Not worth it,"I have passed the 70-290 exam using the sister book to this one (didn't like it), and since I already had this one from school, I gave it a go. I did not fair too well on the test, as I scored just under passing. I purchased the Microsoft 70-291 guide and it is so much better it is unreal. If you plan on taking the test, do not use this book as your only source of information. As a reference, it's pretty good, but not much else."
3,Okay,"This book is a little hard to read, but it helped me passed the course. The professor who was teaching this course had a really thick accent, so I learned mostly from the book. Hard to understand, but contained lots of information."
5,Wonderful -- Nothing short !,"This is my first experience with Nicholas Gunn. I liked it right from the beginning. All the tracks are good. I will recommend this to any music lover. The tunes have a charm -- joyous and vibrant... This CD made a fan out of me for Nicholas Gunn right away, and this one is just the beginning of the many CDs I will own of his."
3,Mellow and relaxing but lacks the passion of earlier albums,"I love anything by Nicholas Gunn. However, this album is so-so and humdrum contrasted with The Sacred Fire and Music of the Grand Canyon. Those albums were absolutely moving and conveyed the passion and essence of the Southwest and its history - especially the ancient dwellers of the Grand Canyon. I still remember walking into The Nature Company and hearing The Sacred Fire for the first time - it was awesome and moving!! If you really want to listen to his music that captures that type of feeling and has more variety, I recommend those two albums."
4,"love the meter, hate the instruction book","This is truly a great light meter. It will do it all and includes the spot meter and the transmitter. But you can throw the instruction booklet away - it's useless when trying to figure out how to use all of the capabilities of this meter. Go watch some of the tutorials on U Tube or the Sekonic site - they are helpful. Also, go to Adorama TV and look at some of their videos - they will fill in some of the gaps. I'm not sure you can beat Sekonic when it comes to light meters, but they need to work on their instuctions."
5,Light meter from hell.,I am so glad I got it. I think I am getting the hang of setting it up. I need to find someone that knows it better than I do.
3,Just far too expensive for what it does...,"Great meter, killer critical for flash reading, background evening out, and pinpointing hot and cold spots.But just way too expensive. My iphone app is $1.99 and it's $598 cheaper.Come on Sekonic, you can make this meter for less than $30, so hit us for a 100% mark up and let's go shooting."
2,It could have been nice............,The memory button rubber cover fell off when I took it out the box and it took a couple of minutes to come alive. Sold it to a friend and got a Kenko. Looked really nice too.
4,all in one unit,"There are lots of times when the meter in your camera does a good job. For the rest of the time you need a meter. I used this for taking an evening shot of Christmas lights over a lake. Maybe I could of guessed the exposure, but the Sekonic meter made the process much less prone to errors. I got an excellent shot the first time. I have not used all the features yet, but the spot meter is excellent."
3,"Complicated, poor interface, doesn't come with important ""target""","The Sekonic 758DR is obviously an incredibly powerful tool, capable of a vast array of functions. However, the interface to this device is only fair, the included software is fairly rough and lacks even basic wizard functions to walk the user through use. The biggest problem though is that for $499.00, you don't get the option ""profiling target"" that allows one to create custom profiles for their digital or film camera. It's an extra $100.00! For this price, Sekonic is gouging their customers.This is a device that needs an Interaction Designer to go through it and make it less pure engineering and more intuitive. Sekonic should include this magic target accessory and not lead customers to believe they're getting a feature that, in reality, is not complete.I can't recommend this product."
2,"Out of 3, does one work?","So I loved these when they first came out, and we used them in the D60 for several projects. During one of the events the drive developed a strange noise and shortly died mid-shoot. Not a good time. The noise was rather like an old turboprop plane starting up, speeding up and slowing down. We were unable to salvage any data off it.We got that one replaced under warranty and the new one arrived and worked fine for about 6 shoots before succombing to an early death just like the last.We currenty have the third one in and it is working fine but we now have three 1 gig Lexar's in spare because we can't count on these on critical applications.As random storage I suspect this is probably OK, but if you NEED to not lose the data, look elsewhere."
2,Sooner or later.....,"I knew the reviews before buying one...I enjoyed the huge memory space...It worked flawlessly, right up until suddenly it started making a bad noise. The only thing worse than losing an image, is losing hundreds of them. It worked for a little over a year, being used on a sporatic basis. I wouldn't recommend anyone buys them ever."
2,"It worked for me, but don't buy one","I owned a 1GB IBM Microdrive for just about 3 and a half years when just yesterday it died on me. Granted, that's a long time to have a microdrive, and I used it HARD for that long without any problems. I had no complaints during its lifespan. But truth be told, their reputation for unreliability precedes them. I completely expected it to fry a lot sooner, and lived in constant fear of something happening. When you're taking pictures, you want them to be SECURE, something this microdrive can't guarantee you. I was lucky, and didn't lose any pictures. I was lucky, and enjoyed a lengthy life with my microdrive. But don't rely on luck, which is what you're forced to do when you buy one."
5,MJQ Collaboration,"Laurindo Almeida's guitar is exquisite, while Milt Jackson's vibes soothe and Lewis' piano is exceptionally accurate, as always. It is a pleasure to listen to these artists."
5,"Collaboration, MJQ and Laurindo Almeida","Atlantic Records produced this fantastic collaboration as an LP (Atlantic #1429 in 1964). I missed the original CD re-issue and bought this Collectible Records licensed re-issue. Though not a particularly good reproduction (lacks the depth of the original LP), it's worth having and is on my ""desert island list."" Very sophisticated, wonderful listening on all cuts. The highlight is the launch into One Note Samba by the full group after a magnificent rubato cadenza filled intro chorus by Almeida. Find an original Atlantic CD if you can."
3,Not the item listed,"The track listing is correct, but the description and all the comments (but one) relate to another disc - Collaboration. How to find the correct info? Is MJQ40 a compilation, a concert? Some tracks have applause, but other sound very very old ... like from the beginning of those 40 years."
5,Is your dream to build your own house? This book is for you!,"Because I hold the seemingly far off dream of one day designing and building my own quiet secluded nest, I was delighted when this book was recommended to me by Amazon.com. I usually don't even read those pesky E-mail advertisements sent to me . . . but the title alone ""House Dreams"", caught my eye. Hugh Howard completes an amazing task of actually making the reader feel like he/she is part of the building process of his dream home. While some of the architectural history flew way over my head, the book was still a delight to read based on Howard's delectable annecdotes pertaining to how taking on such an enormous task of building his own home, effected his family. This book keeps the hope alive in me that one day too, my dreams could come true."
4,Detailed and well done guide to seashore animals.,"This field guide to seashores is well explained, especially for beginners encouraged to learn more about the life in tidepools. The color illustrations are also nice and detailed. Buy this one before you start on the original official Peterson Field guides.Recommened for beginning and intermediate learners."
2,Has Moments,"A tale of existential desolation, it has moments but is self-indulgent and scattered.I bought this because I was impressed by Thom Hoffman in ""Black Book,"" and because Mr. Hoffman could apparently move from a ""brave"" perfomances in films like ""Fourth Man"" to ""ultrabrave"" (soft-core at least) stuff like this to touring the Netherlands as Henry Higgins in ""My Fair Lady."""
3,An Elegy for the Lost,"A weird movie to watch. Not a piece you want to see, if you're used to Titanics and Dances with Wolves. Yet: a very melancholy tone runs through the whole film, leaving you dreamy and unpredictable. Which proves interesting, because I am not a person who likes pornography to be 'thrown at her face' as a 'piece of culture'.Actually: judge for yourself! You won't be disappointed."
1,poor quality plastic totes,The plastic totes are of poor quality. After just a little bit of play the corners chip off leaving sharp shards of plastic for my baby to pick up and sharp corners on the tote where it has broken off. This has happened on several of the totes with only normal wear and tear. Also they don't always fit well into their slots so you have to pull really hard to get them out. I do not recommend this product at all!
3,Excellent color coded organizational tool!!!,"This item is great for clean up. I love the color coded bins. The height, width and length are perfect. It fits snugly in a corner of a closet or can be used in the child's bedroom. I like it because it doesn't take too much space. My only dilemma is that the pine wood is so frail that during assembly my boyfriend poked a hole right through the side of the wood."
2,Eh.,I bought it because it was recommended by a fictional character in a Jonathan Lethem short story book I read. I should know better than to get books based on fictional characters.
1,Horrible!! don't waste ur money...,"This movie was pathetic... it was nothing i expected.. most of it was just pictures. Not Great.. So don't waste your money on this... Play Boy just god bored with this one they didn't put much into it... DON""T BUY IT!!"
3,2 mid-level stars,"This seemed like another pretty average year with 2 mid-level stand-outs. Jodi Ann Paterson is an all around hottie for sure. Nicole Lenz has a great face & hair. Her all natural almost total lack boobs still looks better than a lot of the implants on the DVD as well. I can't say either girl is a strong enough reason to buy this DVD over other years given the all around mediocrity of the majority of the girls. There are def. better years to get than this.My biggest complaint is that of the girls end up in bed with a guy caressing/kissing them. It's still pretty tame which is good but the guys really only serve to block the view of the girls. That's the lame part.As usual, that's just my opinion."
3,Nothing really new,"This is a total recycler. The fine folks at Playboy need to come up with an original way of looking at these women to keep my interest. The soundtrack is composed of clones of several radio-friendly tracks (i.e. 'So Free' (think Santana)). I'm sure Playboy has connections and could get some original talent on the production end. On the upside, Nicole and Jennifer have outstanding physical attributes, and Jodi Ann is definitely a perfect ten."
1,Avoid the Myto edition of the Kubelik Meistersinger,"The Kubelik Meistersinger is an outstanding performance, perhaps the best ever recorded in stereo. But, the Myto edition is from a bootleg copy, in inferior sound, and pitched slightly flat. The recording was once available in a fine transfer from the original Bavarian Radio stereo tapes on the Calig label, but Calig is now defunct. The German label Arts Music has now re-mastered this recording 96kHz/24-bit, also from the original stereo tapes. The catalog number is 43020 - this is now the preferred edition of this recording, and the price is far less than the Myto. Arts Music has also issued a Bavarian Radio Parsifal with Kubelik from 1980, an equally fine performance, cat. number 43027. Let's hope that Amazon.com carries both of these recordings soon. In the mean time, avoid the Myto Meistersinger at all costs!"
5,great music...great players,"Bluegrass or jazz? Hard to say...maybe it's JazzGrass....it's bluegrass instruments, but this is pretty improvisational....hard to not find your self humming this stuff in your head even when it's not playing. Super music..."
3,So So - Could Have Been Great,"Although I give a similar rating to the other reviewers, it's for different reasons. I like the song arrangements, that is, the tempos, style, and other various changes. What I don't like is the instrumentation. Every other song (literally) makes use of an electric bass rather than an upright bass. Likewise, some of the songs have percussion and even a little electric guitar.The producers would have done better to record the songs all acoustic with an upright bass and no percussion. That's what gives bluegrass it's flavor and feel. Don't monkey it up with new age stuff. In my book bluegrass has no room for ""contemporary."""
4,great product for external cdroms,I like it a lot.One think that I am thinking about this product is the cables. The cables are too short.
1,Many Problems!,"The Good: Photo quality is excellentThe Bad: Cartridges are not convenient, the machine does not have internal storage for photo, color and black. When your family uses the printer for all uses, this is far from ideal.For regular paper printing, any more than 2 sheets ordered on the same job, a paper jam is in your immediate future.For 4X6 borderless printing, the photo was never centered on the 4X6 photo paper, and it was not printed straight. We always had to go through and even the photos up with a scissors.After 6 months of use, the cartridges would stick and the printer would freeze up. Repairs offered were more than a new printer. We would have to manually pull the cartridge away from the side, and restart our computer to cancel the frozen jobs and trick the printer into working.There is more bad, but I'm sure that you get the picture."
3,Great printer if you don't mind waiting,"This printer is very slow....even on normal documents with the black ink cartridge and on normal settings. However, the photos do come out amazing! The only problem I've had with it is that it says it doesn't recognize the ""left ink cartridge"" and the printer tells me to replace it even though it's brand new and an HP brand #57 cartridge. I've done everything to fix the problem including buying another cartridge and it still doesn't work. I ended up just taking out the color cartridge and printing with the photo one which is a waste, but oh well."
1,Printer Broken,"The printer arrived in a timely manner but did not work. I have had it with HP printers, only buying Canon's from now on."
2,where are the borderless prints?,"First of all, let me caveat this by saying I own two other HP printers. Their products have been great in the past. I am actually biased toward hp printers. So, onward...This printer doesn't do true 4x6 borderless prints. This would be fine, except that HP says it does! The catch: you have to get special perforated 4x6 cards! I am pretty upset about this- if the photo isn't 4x6 with no border on any 4x6 media, it's not borderless! There is no workaround for this from HP either. This problem is the same for the 5550, 7350, 7550 models.And btw, if you do print a border, it doesn't come out even all the way around the print (even after re-calibration).With that said, the HP has an amazing feature set, color correction capabilities, etc. But we bought this to do borderless prints- if that is what you want, go elsewhere!"
3,What's with the paper jams?,"We bought this printer to print out a large number of invitations for a party we were having. It worked great! It was quiet, went fairly quick, and didn't give us any trouble. It seems to be great quality, although we haven't tried printing and photos.Recently though, we have getting papers jams ALL THE TIME! This printer CONSTANTLY picks up more than one sheet causing a paper jam and a BIG hassle. Believe me, we have tried many different varieties of paper but it keeps jamming!I have no idea how to fix this, but it's becoming a big hassle!"
4,Beautiful pictures,"This printer worked fine right out the box. Set up, installation of software was breeze. No problem with it working with my operating system XP. My pictures that I scanned and printed came out beautiful. It really did look like they were done by a professional.(sorry) my only problem with it was that after two weeks, I had to replace the #58 print cartridge, as I believe that--that cartridge was probably a demo, otherwise everything else was just fine. BTW I did find a great price (wont mention the site here however,)for both my replaced color and my new black cartridge. Look around, great prices are out there.Enjoy printing. :)"
1,HP Photosmart 7350,"I bought the 7350 less than 2 years ago and paid almost $200.00 for it. It sounds like a thrashing machine, clunks and jerks, and now it only prints occasionally. I'm taking it to the Goodwill store today; maybe someone else can get it to perform since I sure can't. I'm tired of trying.Joann in Texas"
2,HP let me down on this one,"Good printer except I have to unplug it from the power source and ""reboot"" the printer to get it to be recognized by the Windows XP machine. Real pain. Black ink cartridge is a little low in capacity."
3,"Happy with Amazon, Unhappy with HBeckerUS","We ordered a used HP7350 so we could use our supply of new cartridges originally purchased for another HP model that died. Amazon's third party vendor, HBeckerUS, failed to ship and appears to be an unreliable vendor. Beware folks!! Fortunately, Amazon helped us a lot and responded in suggesting we just accept a full refund. Great service and fast responses from Amazon Customer Service!!"
1,Slower than a dial-up modem,"This is without a doubt, the worst printer I have ever purchased. I bought this one to use on my HP computer, as I use a Photosmart 1115 with my Power Mac G4 and it is excellent. I figgured the extra inking would be better on the PC. WRONG. So I tried it on the Mac, it is SLOWER. It runs about 1 page per minute and a half. A color photo takes 5 minutes, and this is a small 4x6 print. I'll keep the 1115. It has better photo quality also. AND, the smart card reader is also slow. The 1115 reads the same photos in 1/10 th the time. I will never recommend this printer to anyone."
2,Not Reliable,I get a lot of jams. I didn't expect this lack of quality with a name brand printer. Wouldn't buy it again.
3,Not worth the money )$148.00,"The problem I have is the faces being rather fuzzy. Have tried everything to correct it , have not figured out how or if it can be done.Its very easy to use, if only I could get clearer pictures!"
1,Mac compatibility is terrible.,"I'm using the HP photosmart 7350 with a powermac g4 866 running OS 10.2, and the latest drivers and patches from Apple. When I first installed the printer I couldn't print to it at all with the out of the box software. After 20 minutes of troubleshooting, I downloaded the newest drivers from HP's website. This allowed me to print from iphoto and photoshop. The photos I printed on glossy inkjet paper are average, which is the only good thing about this printer that I have found so far. It isn't hot swappable (USB is supposed to be, and my last USB printer was), and I commonly have to restart my computer to get it to print if the printer is unplugged. The print options are limited in terms of paper, and the plastic paper tray is extremely flimsey. The black text output is also terrible. The bottom line: If you want to print from a mac, buy a different printer."
1,"Slow, ... painful","Sure, buy this printer, if you want to spend hours and dollar$$ to get the quality of prints from your digital camera that almost match the quality of prints from [a] one-time use Kodak camera available at any grocery store.And don't expect to use it with your computer - the only use for this printer is to plug in a memory card, print an index sheet, and then print those expen$$ive sheets.Don't waste your time or money."
1,its loud and slow,i had just bought this and it is very loud it sounds like it need oil or something. it print quality is not any better than the one i had before. i am going to junk it.
4,"Excellent HDTV, but Service is a Problem","I spent six months looking at small HDTV sets for my living room before settling on the Samsung TXM3098, which was replaced by the TXN3098. It is a wonderful set in many ways:- Beautiful, vivid picture with an HDTV signal (I use RCN cable) or with DVD input (I am using composite input for DVD)- Very good picture with a standard signal (much better than my old set, with four screen size options)- Terrific sound for a stand-alone set- Easy-to-navigate menu systemMy major complaint is service: I am suffering from geometric distortion with some signals, and Samsung shows absolutely no sign of being willing to return my call or stand behind their product. This is very disturbing."
1,No customer support,It looks good but their support is terrible. The TV arrived with a bad tube. It sat on the shop for repair for 3 weeks before Samsung gave any answer. They finally said that they wouldn't send a replacement tube. I then had to ship it back to the dealer at my cost. Don't buy Samsung products. Your may save in the front end but you loose in the back end !
3,WHY no 720p support?,"Yea why dosent any of Samsungs HD-ready tube televisons even the high quality tantus series not support 720p. These tv's are great for DVD veiwing but if your a video game player like me then you should check out the Toshiba 30"" HD ready tv. it has a smaller footprit than samsungs 26"" 16:9 TV and supports all HD signals it also is the same price. so if you are not a video game fanatic then Samsung HD Tube tvs are great, nice price for size but still no 720p support."
1,How to live through a Bad Day,"I have the book on Kindle and love it! I thought I would buy the EZ Plan paid $30.00 for used book and was SHOCKED!! To receive a good condition, thin paperbook, that should have been $10-15 at the most!It was not the book, but, the EZ Lesson bought through Treasuresbooks I emailed my complaint and of course have not heard from them how disappointing."
4,Great poster!,"If you like Bunny Suicides, this is a fun poster to make you chuckle whenever you look at your wall. This is a great gift idea for fellow deranged Bunny Suicide fans."
4,Pretty fine,"This book has a lot going for it. Some quality people have come from Ringwood, and this is a great example of a book about that locale. Thanks."
5,Romance Collection,"As with all of Giovanni's music, I wasn't disappointed with the Romance Collection. Very relaxing music. Can listen to it all day without tiring of it."
3,Be Prepared for the Mess,"Got this as a gift for our child. It is an artificial sand complete with molds and tools plus some added little toys. The sand have pretty candy colors and are very attractive. It is a lot of fun for the kids, but at the same time it is frustrating for them attempting to create critters with the molds as the sand crumbles very easily. It needs some help from grown-ups to press the mold harder to make a press. Still, once they hold them with their hands they crumbles. Obviously, not for kids who love to put things in their mouths.It is just no way you can have this toy played inside the house especially near carpets or your couch. Be prepared for a big mess."
1,Way too messy,"I'm the mom who is always trying to convince my kids to get messy. Put their fingers in the paint and all that. I was not prepared for the mess this was going to make on our dining room table though. It's really just moldable sand. It doesn't hold the shapes well when you do mold it, so it's not like play dough where the kids can play with the shapes they've made either. You can mold it but once you try to move your shape it just falls apart."
1,Horrible!!!!!!,"This moon sand toy is just like regular sand in that it gets on everything and everywhere. The problem with that mostly is that this not natural like real sand. Packaging states that after touching the moon sand, hand washing is highly recommended. Not possible to wash your hands after it's gotten on everything and tracked on beds, other toys, etc. I DONT recommend it whatsoever! Get real sand instead!!! Much, much better!!!!!!! Real sand and water is much, much better!!!"
3,fun stuff!,"My daughter who is 9 loves this stuff. It can be messy, but it came with it's own tub/mat type thing that traps it in pretty well. We just vaccuum it out and it is pretty easy to clean up"
4,My kid loves it,My little 4 year old girl reived this from santa and she is really enjoying playing with it.
1,not good,"Only lasted 5 months, could have bought a more expensive one but I figured I would give it a try. I did, now I realize why they are so cheap."
4,Nice Book,"Clare Sainsbury gives a wonderful account of what it is like to be a schoolchild with Asperger syndrome drawn from her own experience, as well as commenting about theories on the subject. This should provide valuable insight to both teachers and parents as well as being one of those 'me too' reads for other people with Asperger syndrome like myself. If you are a teacher though and you only want to read one book then this one probably shouldn't be it, simply because I don't think this book alone is enough."
4,SMOOTH MOVE,THE SLIDE RODS ON THIS ROUTER IS SMOOTH UP AND DOWN AND NONE STICKYNESS MAKES THI TOOL A JOY TO OPERATE.THE EASY REACH THUMB SWITCH MAKES FOR A NONE TIRING OPERATION.EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A RECONDITIONED TOOL IT STILL HAS A LIKE NEW WARRENTY..............
5,Excellent and evocative Romantic Viennese Violin music.,"Excellent and evocative Viennese Romantic Violin pieces, very much in the composer's (Kreisler) style."
4,interesting selection,"I have been an avid follower of the Vienna New Year's Concert for many years, and especially since the conductors chance every year it has become a very intersting musical offering. One has to give Harnoncourt once again great credit for a highly interesting program selection. In the area of light viennese polka and waltz music there a many beaten paths and many favorites played to death. Harnoncourt uses his great knowledge and thoroughness to surprise listeners with different wonderful pieces every time he ventures into this genre. As a musical scholar and teacher one of his great themes is the musical dialogue, and in this collaboration with the Vienna Philharmonic (he used to be a cellist in this same orchestra), the dialogue is clearly working very well. My one issue with him once again is pace. Some of the pieces are a bit slow-footed and they loose their lightness in the process."
1,Buy The Real CD not this EP!,"If this was the Flyleaf CD I'd give it 5 stars but this is the EP, it sucks compared to the Flyleaf CD, the only good song on here is Breathe Today, so buy the real CD instead, it has better versions of the songs on here and more songs, or the import, it has extra tracks and a video."
1,"Not Good, Tries Too Hard","This band is trying too hard to sound edgy and hard, but they don't really succed in my opinion. The singer kind of sounds like Alanis Morissette but without the Canadian accent."
5,Awesome debut,Just an astounding debut. Welcome Lacey to the world of great musical artists. This girl belongs on the world stage. A natural. And the rest of the band shines as well.
5,Worth a listen,"This EP was originally released May 2005. It's such an amazing debut. First time I heard it I was disappointed with the fact there were only 6 songs! Heavy guitar riffs, strong, emotional vocals and music and lyrics with a message, reaching out to the Christian community aswell as the rest of the world.Lacey Mosley (singer):""Our music is passionate and on purpose. It's about our experiences and passions and how we have overcome them.""And that exactly is what reached my heart and made me love the band as much as I do."
1,i recieved turkish apricots,"Turkish apricots are whole plump and sweet.California apricots should be halves, be chewy and tart.I wont be returning these because is not worth the hassle. If I had received the apricot that they described here, they would have had a great customer because I eat sun dried California apricots every day."
5,This is the only book you need....,"I've gone through all the office organizing, management, and esteem-building books; but this small book takes the truth of people's behavior and puts it in tasty, insightful morsels. Everyday I randomly pick a page and observe the book's wisdom explainig the actions of co-workers, bosses, and clients."
4,great idea book,The book is good. The service fast. -just not exactly what I had expected for the type of book.
4,If you're still learning about sewing - BUY This book,"There's a lot of books out thee - but if you're still learning a lot of the more advanced tricks - BUY THIS BOOK. Seriosuly - I am usually happy to get half a dozen new ideas out of a book - usually makes up for what I spend - but that is all this book is about. New Tips and Tricks.I was estatic to see some of the coat lining techniques used in one of my Amrmani coats broken down and described so well. Its like ""OH Ok - thats how its down"" Its full of stuff like that.Maybe if you've been sewing for 30+ years and have a college degree in fashion - you might know everything from cover to cover already - but if your a still new or an intermediate still learning - this book is an ideal find."
4,Secrets that sould be known to every sewer,"Although the pictures are old fashioned, to say the least, the technic and tips of how to manage the smallest details are priceless. And I thought I knew it all after 25 years of sewing. This book is a bible to every sewer."
2,Was Rather Underwhelmed,"As much as I hate to rain on anyone's parade, this book was not what I expected. Instead of clear, detailed instructions of certain techniques, I found myself frustrated with the graphics that were confusing to decipher and instructions that were not clear.I wish the author has spent a little less time name dropping and more time being thorough in her descriptions. So many techniques were in the book but they seemed to be glossed over quickly instead of giving each of them the space they deserved.Many of the examples used seemed rather dated to me, such as flounces or a cowl/draped neckline. The technique for keying a zipper could have used more space to expand.Additionally it was too bad that the publishers didn't decide to do the book in a hard cover. When you're in the midst of a project with one hand on your fabric and the other in a reference book, you want the chosen pages to remain flat whilst you use them."
2,Nothing new - disappointed,there was only one technique that was unique and interestingthe rest I learned in high school sewing classa book for beginners
3,Expected alot more than received,"being a fasion student in America I look for any resource that I can find pertaining to real Haute Couture, but this book was a real disappointment. It basically has everything that I've already learned expect for the roses thats a pretty good idea. But for home sewers its absolutely PERFECT! Home sewers will really get alot of experence from this book."
3,High fashion...Maybe,"I was completely unimpressed with this book. It does contain some interesting sewing techniques, but for the most part she shows you how to copy design features of now out-of-style designer clothing and shares a lot of famous designer trivia (lots of name dropping). There are some useful tips, but for the price of the book, tips are not worth it. The last third of the book is dedicated to drafting patterns from scratch or copying other clothing. The only photos are of the finished garment - no photos of the techniques or steps. Illustrations are adequate, not great."
3,I am torn on this book,"It does have some great tips, and instructions on copying clothes etc. but one cannot deny that many of the ""secrets"" are indeed dated. For example, I can promise you that you will never need to know how to make a Double Flounce collar (page 79). Many of the designers highlighted here hit their popularity in the 80s and much of couture sewing in general (but especially couture of 20+ years ago) is just not relevent to every day style. Definitely use the ""Search Inside"" feature to see what I mean. Still, it is not very expensive and I believe that overall there is enough in here to warrant having it in my library."
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"This book is much more basic than Shaeffer's Couture book, and some of the style and design suggestions are a bit dated (copyright is 1997), but all basic instructions can be applied to more current and/or trendy styles and details, with just a bit of imagination and determination. Excellent construction, no matter how ""now"" your design may be, will always add that bit of flair, so the book is helpful in improving and adapting your sewing skills to produce garments that avoid that ""home made"" look."
3,Sewing secrets,"I am a bit disappointed that i did not check out the publishing date before purchasing - i would have liked a book of this nature that is more up to date. However, the information contained is good, and the book is good to have on one's shelf for reference purposes."
3,Sewing,"I wanted a good reference book on advanced sewing skills and this did not do that. It showed several selected types of details, none that I would ever use, and then expained how to do them. If you want a more broad explaination, this book won't work for you."
2,disappointing quality,Charm is very thin and flimsy - feels like something you'd get at a dollar store- design doesn't show up accurately in photos - I won't order from this company again - low quality - too bad because the celtic birth charm idea is interesting -
3,Well,"It looks really cool, have always wanted a spiral oneZ but the balls don't stay tight for very long, so even with constant retightening one of thE balls fell off and it lost forever within 2 weeks of getting it. If that hadnt happened, I would've have 4-5 stars"
2,Bosch 1640VSK-46 Needs a 0 -2000 variable speed control,"The best best part about this trim saw kit is the kit, though it lacks adequate instructions for safe use of the clamps and so on with the well built mitre box. Bosch should spend a bit more time at the drawing design board installing a true variable speed control into this tool. A vibration reduction system (they can use some lessons learned from their jig saws) would be welcome also, because this Bosch 1640VSK-46 as currently built vibrates as much in cutting pine as a reciprocating saw vibrates in cutting steel tube. Pass this saw bye, save your money unless you're able to integrate a speed control or Bosch integrates a speed control into it."
3,"A good daily devotional, but not an exhaustive study","This book is much easier to digest on the first reading than many of Wright's other works, although a bit less rewarding. The book is structured so that small sections of the gospel text are translated by Wright and followed by his mini exegesis.I found the book to be thought provoking and not as weighty as one might expect. This is refreshing after reading NTPG and JVG, Luke For Everyone is a layman's version of these two."
5,vERY HELPFUL BOOK,This is our third copy--We keep govong them away to others! I find it very helpful for sermons.
4,pleased!,"Shipping was very fast (impressed since it's getting close to Christmas!). The pendant is very pretty, looks just like picture!"
4,Great charm,"I wear this pendant all the time, it's a beautiful design. The only thing I'd change is to make the ring a bit tighter, so it doesn't jingle. For the price though - it's definitely worth it."
1,"Good Software, Bad Hardware.",I've only had this computer for around two years. Within 3 months of buying it the hard drive went out. This was followed by the power chord breaking within a year. Now the slot where the power chord inserts is broken. Quite honestly I HATE this computer. I'm never buying a Sony again.
3,sony garb,"Well I knew sony wasnt that good in computers when I bought this thing. But I bought it anyway. HP and TOSHIBAs were far superior, the battery on the sony doesnt fit tightly in the computer, it shakes around, somtimes the latch comes loose and you can really lose your battery. The keyboard is nice and the camera is good. It is pretty slow for windows vista, you might look for somthing with more speed for vista, this doesnt cut the mustard. THis will be my second and last sony, the last one had disk failure twice and then I was told they would extend the warrenty which they never did, once this one goes south it goes in the trash. The machine looks cool in the pictures but isnt that great in person. The hp dv2000's are mrore substantial and you can hear the speaker. The cr has the worst speakers i have seen in a long time, sort of the speed of the macbook...."
1,Display Driver not compatable,"Hi,There is Display driver compatability problem with all the sony laptop of this kind 140,120,121 series etc.In this laptop most of the videos blurs.This product will not play the online compressed vidoes .which i an able to watch perfectly with My HP Laptop.It is still a bug with this model,not yet fixed i went with sony people to solve this issue but they dont have any solution, they do not agree it is a bug and they say good.if u wana test it watch the demo spider man movie comes with this laptop.I suggest dont go for this laptop until this is fixed.Thanks & Regards,Venkat."
5,Gorgeous!,This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Abide in Me/Monk's Reverie is transcendent. The artists are masters who have arranged the pieces on this album exquisitely. A joy to the senses!
5,Important Insight,This book helped me to see the significance of the two myths described in the book. This information in this book has become part of my new perspective on life.
3,AS IF NICOLES SISTERS WOULD BREAK INTO ANOTHER PERSON HOUSE,PLEASE HOW STUPID DOES TERRI BAKER THINK WE ARE. EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVE MOST OF TERRIS STORY I FELT SHE STREACH THE TRUTH A LITTLE BIT. I ONLY WONDER WHAT THE BROWNS REACTION TO THIS BOOK WAS
2,Sooner or later...,"Eventually everyone who ever knew O.J. will write a book abouthim, without saying anything worth hearing. His niece certainly did.Lord knows, I'm no O.J. fan and I believe he's guilty as can be of murder. But this little book is enough to make me feel some modicum of sympathy for him. The niece whines constantly that O.J. was treated better than other family members. Reason: he had more money. Too bad, girl. He made every penny of it. That's how it works. I can think of several reasons not to like Simpson, but the niece doesn't touch those. END"
4,ENJOYED READING IT,"This is a good book.I believe that what she is telling is true.I think O.J. is the kind of person who would make his own family wait in line to get tickets to watch him play football.Jesus,how inconsiderate!And when Terri and her family came down to visit,O.J. would go out to dinner with other people and leave them at home.They must really care for him,they stood by him through his trial.Glad to see Terri had the guts to speak out,I can imagine the rest of the family probably shunned her for that,but the truth is the truth."
5,courageous and truly gutsy!,"Terri Baker has the guts to tell the truth about her uncle, and her experiences at the criminal and civil trials. I've heard people comment that she should be loyal and stand by her uncle blindly because he's family. Where would we be if everyone did that? For instance, what if David Kaczynski had just kept his mouth shut so Ted could keep sending out his letter bombs? Terri took the right track in coming out and daring to speak the truth about her beliefs in her uncles probable guilt and her sympathy for the Brown and Goldman's. Hooray for you, Terri. Let's hope more of Simpsons's friends and relatives have the guts to tell ALL they know! I loved this book, and highly recommend it to everyone who has the nerve to see both sides! Terri is a very smart and beautiful lady, who dares to let America peek behind the facade of this famous family."
3,believable,"The author gives a very believable account of life inside O.J.'s family . The fact that she is so open about her own mistakes and problems , and that she still hesitates to say definitively that O.J. is a murderer make me think she is telling the truth. Sad story, but not really surprising."
3,A GOOD ALBUM OVERPRODUCED,"Stills never quite got the idea of less is more. A hippie version of Phil Spector who thought he was a bluesman and remained [mad] for not getting said respect, he could none the less deliver some great songs that could be arranged on occasion brilliantly. There a great number of tunes here, but he gets bogged down in too many players. ""Change Partners"" became a classic, especially as it related to the swinging door of CSN. His bigger production numbers tend to bring the dynamics of the disc to a grinding halt. The follow up to Bluebird suffers from this bloated production...."
3,A GOOD ALBUM OVERPRODUCED,"Stills never quite got the idea of less is more. ... he could none the less deliver some great songs that could be arranged on occasion brilliantly. There a great number of tunes here, but he gets bogged down in too many players. ""Change Partners"" became a classic, especially as it related to the swinging door of CSN. His bigger production numbers tend to bring the dynamics of the disc to a grinding halt. The follow up to Judy Blue Eyes suffers from this bloated production.All in all, he would do worse, and at the time, this seemed nothing worse than sophomore jinx. ..."
4,An alluring album,"Stephen Stills / 2 : This is an album that lures you in and demands your attention. It is not one of those albums that comes to mind when considering `the Great albums', and yet you learn to embrace each of these tunes and you seek out this album for it's expression and attitude. I wouldn't want to be without this album, but I can't claim to `love' it either. I give it four stars but I wouldn't argue against those who give it Five."
4,billb nailed it,"Don't miss this one if you like Stills. ""Change Partners,"" with Garcia on pedal steel, was an extremely minor hit, but what a great record! Wonderful vocals by Stills complement the very effective shift from waltz time to 4/4. ""Marianne"" is another winner, as are ""Singin' Call"" and ""Fishes and Scorpions"" (which features a Clapton solo). The stuff with the horns is overblown, which keeps this from being a 5-star record. But all in all, it's a real good listen."
4,"Not a great record, perhaps . . .",". . . but a very good one nevertheless. ""Change Partners"" has proved to be a very durable song. ""Fishes and Scorpions"" is a nice acoustic number. The reason why I originally purchased the LP back in 1971, though, is the neglected single, ""Marianne""--a highly enjoyeable, if somewhat slight, rocker, with Stills in the upper reaches of his vocal range. Despite the sometimes unwieldy arrangements, this is a very good set of Stills songs."
5,policeman small,i bought this book for my grandchildren as i was read it as a ittle girl and read it to my children as they grew up. i have always loved lois lensky's books and was very happy to add it to my ever growing library of childrens books.
5,All that and a song,"Pure, as simple and direct as you'd expect from Lois Lenski with an added benefit, the Policeman Small song to sing along."
4,"What a stylish, inexpensive watch!","I originally bought this watch for my 19 year old daughter...but her wrists are too tiny! Even with all the links taken out that could possibly be removed, the watch was still too big. However, the watch was a perfect fit for this 40 year old! I love it...the style, the price was just perfect! So don't hesitate to buy yourself one, unless, of course, you have a tiny wrist!"
3,Not too shabby,"This album didn't blow my socks off nor would I consider it trance. It doesn't really bust into a groove, except for the first track's rock like beat, until track 3. I might have the UK version cause it starts out with Midas and it's listed differently on here. Either way, I give it props for being atmospheric, but that's about it. There is much better trance, electronic out there, such as the chemical brothers."
1,Don't read this book if you're a linguist...,"The linguistics in this book are painfully bad. This guy knows nothing about Algonquian languages and can't even keep straight which one he's talking about. (There are more than 20, and each one is different. Algonquian is a language family like Indo-European. And by the way, the Mi'kmaq are NOT part of the Algonquin nation!) A Mohican man told me the author had made up some of the stuff in this book, despite some Mohicans trying to correct him. I believe it.Of course, the book is mostly about spirituality, not linguistics, and that part may be much more valid. I wouldn't know--personally, I was too put off by the errors to finish the thing. If you don't care about languages you may like this book anyway. The writing style seems interesting. I just couldn't get past the gross inaccuracies in the one part I already knew something about."
4,Anthropological linking of natural religion to world culture,"""No Word for Time"" is easy reading. Evan Pritchard shares a personal one on one experience with ""Ben"" a Mic Mac Shaman/Medicine man and reveals a link with other cultures around the world. One past life flashback as a small boy in Canada will bring tears to the eyes of the reader. Enjoy reading about natural rythmic occurences experienced through the eyes of the Native peoples and translated into the written word. A hard book to put down!"
2,Nice try but...,More New Age tripe from someone who thinks he knows what he's writing about. ( The guy grew up in a D. C. Suburb! ) Much of the information is just flat out wrong or mutilated to the point of being useless. Look to Bruchac or Kinney for the genuine information you deserve!
1,What?,"There are Algonquian words for time. There just isn't a noun for ""time,"" but that's because nouns and verbs are used differently in these languages. Three examples of verbs about time in Maliseet (an Algonquian language): Tan kehs aciye (What time is it?), amsqahsukonohom (It is the first day of the month), acehtaqsopon kolahkom kat op metsiyew (if she had changed the time on her clock she wouldn't be late).Algonquian people definitely knew how to keep and measure time, including moderately sophisticated astronomy. This is just another ""Wow, those primitive Native Americans didn't even know how to keep time, how simple and spiritual they must be, maybe they transcend linear time"" bunch of crap. Okay, maybe Algonquins aren't so strict about being on time as Germans, but neither are Greeks or Arabs, and nobody says those guys are too primitive to understand the concept of linear time.How insulting."
2,Pump Stopped pumping!!!!,I had this pump for less than a month and it stopped pumping?? No reason.. Of course you are not supposed to return to store so I had to call the company and they kept on telling me to do the same thing clean the valve and I had done that numerous times and finally they sent me another valve and they said that that was the problem which clearly that was not the problem!!So then they finally offered to replace it but I had to ship them certain parts and they would not even pay for shipping and it took sooo long my milk supply is gone!!!! How terrible is that!!!!
1,It HURTS,"I am a RN and I bought this item because it was affordable. It works well but the problem that I have is the breast shields. I bought the double pump and the breast shields are the same--made out of a rubbery material and they have indentations all around the shield. At every indentation, you get a bruise (sort of like a hickey)and they all hurt. I use the Medela breast pumps at worka and they are pain-free as well as fast and quiet, which this pump is not. I have since purchased a medela pump and I love it."
3,Better than manual ........but not for everyday.,"I thought I was saving a lot of money buying this pump, and I was, but if you are a busy back to work mom, Medela is the way to go.The pumping action was some what effective but it took up to 15 minutes to pump two ounces. Also the single pump meant that it would take half hour to forty-five minutes to completely express from both breasts.After using the pump for three months, the motor started to go. I would say it is a good pump for the mom who just needs occassional pumping. For the rest a hospital grade doubple pump is essential."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY PUMP,"I GOT A MEDELA SINGLE PUMP FOR MY SHOWER AND DECIDED TO RETURN IT AND USE THE EXTRA MONEY THAT I WOULD SAVE BY BUYING THIS PUMP FOR SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS ON MY REGISTRY. BIG MISTAKE. TOTALLY UNABLE TO USE THIS PUMP AS THE BREAST SHIELDS ARE WAY TO SMALL FOR MY NIPPLES, AND IT IS EXTREMELY PAINFUL. I CALLED THE NUMBER FOR THE SHIELDS THAT AREN'T TEXTURED AND THEY SENT ME OUT THE TEXTURED ONES RIGHT AWAY SO NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM NOT IMPRESSED. WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER PRODUCT BY FIRST YEARS THAT I HAD USED WITH PREVIOUS CHILDREN AND THE QUALITY HAD GONE DOWN ON THOSE AS WELL. SO NOW I HAVE TO RENT A MEDELA LACTINA IN ORDER TO PUMP EFFECTIVELY. I FEEL LIKE FIRST YEARS OWES ME SOMETHING BUT NOBODY THERE WANTS TO HELP ME!!!!"
2,Mixed Review,"My son was born 2weeks ago, prematurely,is still in the NICU,& unable to eat by mouth yet. So I appreciate the convenience of the bag - not needing to be near an outlet to use, the built-in thermal compartment to hold my milk,& storage for the parts of the pump.However,I find the pump itself absolutely frustrating. I hate that the suction cup, its shaft, & the bottles are frosted so you cant see if you're aligned properly or if you're even getting anything out.The handle swivels all around,so once you're actually aligned you lose the suction & have to start all over. After 8 months of a hard pregnancy, emergency c-section, & NICU trauma, you don't feel like fighting with a pump. You want to see what you're doing & see results."
1,Not worth it,"I read all the reviews on this pump and everyone said that it was good and worth the money. So I regisitered for it and got it at my baby shower. I have been using it for the last 3 months and it does nothing for me. I only pump an oz or two. At first I thought it was just me, but then I thought maybe I will try another pump just to see. The other pump worked so much better. I do not recommend this pump to anyone. It is SO NOT WORTH IT! I would say spend a little bit more money on a better pump you will be happy that you did."
1,This pump was awful,"When I needed this pump the most, in the middle of the night with sore nipples, it did not produce. I ended up giving my 5 day old formula. I tried the next day and the next few days to use this pump. It is completely useless, it did not express any milk. I ended up buying a medela, much better. Now I know..you get what you pay for. Just go for the medela, forget about this pump."
1,I hate it! The quality sucks!,"I own one of this first year (...)pump.I used it at work so I can continue (...)beeding after back to work. For 8 months it was ok, but one day after I finish pumping oneside,all of sudden the switch stop working. I called the service, they told me to that I have to buy a new one because the warrnty only limited wintin 90 days. The first year's (...)pump won't last the first year. What kind of quality is that?Not just the issue of cost, I have to take a leave from work while one (...)is leaking and go shopping for an other (...)pump. It's not worth to go through the trouble. I suggest everyone to buy other brand with better quality or with better warranty even the price is higher."
4,best BuY,"I am pleased with this product! It's much cheaper than medela and works just as well. ALSO, The first years company has an EXCELLENT customer service. I accidentally sterilized the breast shields too long and deformed them. The company sent me new ones (twice, actually) 1-2 days after I called them and FOR FREE!Only suggestion, I hope it's like the Natural comfort (which I also have) that it has less attachments or less parts. Less to sterilize, less to put together, less time.thanks"
1,Caleb's mom,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I bought this pump since it seemed to have good reviews and the price was right. I should of spent the extra money and bought a Medula. When I first used it I loved the pump. Then after only 3 weeks the pump lost suction, I called the company they told me to boil the breast shield and it should work, it did for that day. The next day I boiled the shield and it did not make a difference I still had no suction and the motor was working fine. Of course it was a saturday and the customer service office was closed. Since I soley express and bottle feed I had to go buy another pump because they dont sell replacement shields in the store. Called the 1/800 number on Monday, they said they would ship new breast shield out immediatly, that was two weeks ago. I have called three times inquiring about the replacement shield and all they tell me is that i should receive it any day. After buying two pumps I could have bought the Medula."
1,Dont waste your money!,"After much review, my daughter decided to add this pump to her baby registry since she only planned on pumping occasionally.But, during the second use, the pump just stopped working right in the middle of pumping and would not restart. She also noticed that the pump was difficult to use since the suction kept breaking. It was also very loud. Luckily, Baby's R US exchanged this pump and let her upgraded to the Pump N Style and she loves it. Its much easier to use and it has a larger motor which is necessary even for the occasional pumper. It is, of coarse, a bigger investment but if you want a reliable breast pump consider making the investment."
3,Tolerable,"if i had to do it all over again..i would spend the money on the pump in style or purley yours. the First years works. It works slowly and loudly,it leaks, and the shield (and assorted parts) need to be boiled regularly because it gets ""out of shape"" and won't suction. if you are going to pump ""once in a while"" this is ok...otherwise spend the money!!"
1,This Pump Left Welts...,"I thought this pump would be a good buy! I had a hospital grade pump and knew I would eventually need to buy a better pump. I got the Evenflow Single Pump from my shower and I didn't want to rely on that for my pumping needs. I thought by getting this one I didn't have to shell out more money for the Medela Pump and boy was I wrong!I was so excited to try this pump that when I was finished there were welts on my breasts! I thought it was the speed so I lowered it for the other side and the same thing happened! Of course the box tells you to call the 800 number before returning it, well, I called the number and they automatically hung up on me and said: We cannot take your call at this time. What's up with that?! Well, I ended up returing, since I got it as a ""gift"", so I had credit to target.com. Hey, I can buy diapers with that."
2,wond never buy again!,Save yourselfe the hassle i bought this and after three months of only pumping once a day the thing broke so I went and bought an ameeda purly yours and I love it! it is quiet and small this thing was massive! anyway spend the extra 100.00 and buy a good pump!
2,Loses suction,"I purchased the First Years Natural Comfort Double Electric/ Battery breast pump and it lost suction after using it once a day for only three weeks. The box recommends this product for full time use, so it should have lasted longer. I called customer service and they are sending me another motor free of charge, but I've been without a pump for about two weeks now and my milk supply in the freezer is running low! Also, the breast shields cut into your nipple and leave marks around your areola (when the suction is actually working!). Also, alot of precious milk leaks out of the breast shields when you are done pumping and remove the shields from your breasts. This product is horrible! Plus, you can't get your money back or return it to the store. I've decided to purchase the Medela Pump in Style Advanced, which I should have done in the first place! Don't waste your money on any of this company's breast pumps. Put your money toward a Medela."
1,very slow and hurts,"I bought this pump to save money and the lactation consultant at the hospital told me to return it. Stubbornly I kept it. It would only pump a few drops of milk and was very painful. They should take these off the market- it's that bad, pay the extra and get a medela. Especially if you pump at least once a day, even a medela hand pump is more effective and comfortable. With my medela pump I can get 4-8 ounces in a few minute comfortably, also you can attach Dr Brown bottles to their pump. First years pump will make you cry, especially bad if you are just learning how to breastfeed etc."
1,Please Be Aware,"I brought this product after reading the reviews from this website. I wished I NEVER brought this pump because it only comes with one breast shield and if you have large nipples then it will be very painful to use. I stopped using the pump after one day and called the company line. I was told there is no guarantee that the shield will fit every woman, however if they would have stated that the pump comes with only one shield and does not fit women with larger than average nipples, I would not have wasted my time OR MONEY!"
2,Not impressed...,"I did my research and this breast pump appeared to be the best value. It is affordable, however, I was not pleased with the product performance at all. The pump is easy enough to use, but the pump is so slow! It took me an hour (sometimes longer) just to pump 4 ounces of milk! The pump is also very noisy and the storage containers are quite small. After a week of use, the product wouldn't work (the vacuum tubing wasn't working properly).I ended up buying the Medela Pump-in-Style. It is more expensive, yes, but I found the product to be a lifesaver. I could pump two breasts at a time, fill two 5 ounce storage containers and be done in 20 minutes or less. Plus, it wasn't as noisy."
3,sorry not to have a nipple to attach directly to the bottle,I'm satisfied with this product. But only one thing that I don't like with it is there is not any nipple for convenient feeding enough to fit the bottle from the pump. other breast pump product has the nipples which can be used with the breast pump bottle directly after pumping without transfering the breast milk from the pump bottle to the feeding bottle.
2,Not worth the time or effort - save your money,"I have The First Years Manual pump and it was the best thing. So I thought, this would make my life even easier. I have twin girls and was trying to build up a supply so my husband would be able to help me feed them. My letdown took forever with this pump. My nipple would hurt so bad with the shield it came with (Too small). If you have even average size breasts (which most women do after giving birth) your nipple will not fit into this shield. This pump took over 15 minutes to pump 4 ounces, wheres as I could use the manual pump for 15 minutes and have 6 - 8 ounces and no sore nipples! Bottom line, save your money by buying the manual pump or invest in a higher end pump."
5,Perfect for working mothers,"I made the mistake of listening to a sales person and bought the whisper wearer for my first pump. It died after 3 weeks of use (using it twice a day). I then had to go back to work and didn't want to buy a really expensive pump so I bought this one. It worked wonders. I used it three times a day at work and was able to pump 6 to 7 ounces each time. I recommend leaving it at work if you can (just since it's a little bulky to transport back and forth, especially if you commute by train/bus/walk). Still if you need it for home it isn't too bulky to go to and from work with, or buy two and leave one at home and one at work (it's cheaper still than buying one of the medela pumps which is just as bulky). All in all you don't need to buy an expensive pump if you're going back to work. This one is perfect, quiet and just what you need to keep up breast feeding."
5,"great, easy, quick","I was so scared I could never get any milk..WELL WAS I WRONG.This pump made my life easy. Was so happy I didn't spend the $200 plus for the top of the line model. I got at least 3 oz in 10 min with this pump and it was easy. The suction adjustment makes it specially nice when you are a bit sore. I am back to work now and my baby is 10 weeks and I pump once in the afternoon and get about 6oz.Do yourself a favor and get this.P.S. I never watched the cd that came with it and I barely read the instructions, just enough to not hurt myself."
2,Very slow and piece broke after three uses!,"I was very excited about the price of this pump, but you get what you pay for. It is very simple and restricted in function. The suction is very slow and does not pump a good amount of breast milk. Also, the piece inside the collection bottle kept falling into the breast milk while I was pumping. I now have the Medela Pump in Style Advance and it is awsome. It is more expensive but if you want to pump enough to feed your baby while at work, it is worth the money."
1,Only 7 weeks of running properly...,"I bought this breast pump right at the birth of my son, and used it twice a day for 7 weeks. All of a sudden, the suction no longer worked on the ""flex-shield"" attachment. So, we took it back to BabiesRUs. They replaced it, no charge. The 2nd machine's ""flex-shield"" only lasted TWO DAYS before losing its suction! I am extremely frustrated - ""The First Years"" said that they would send me another attachment for correct suction, but I'm not excited about continuing to use this machine. We will probably return it this weekend, and get a refund."
3,Micro-fluorescent Night Light,"The night light is adequate if you are satisfied with the amount of light that a 4 watt bulb illuminates, but I prefer using a 7 watt bulb in order to get a bit more illumination."
3,A Marley Footnote,"Although this album doesn't come close to the quality of his other work, it is enjoyable for Marley fans and has become an important part of the Wailers' complete recorded legacy. These songs were recorded for the JAD organization between 1968 and 1972. In 1981 they were overdubbed for a more modern sound and released as this album, ""Chances Are"".The tracks (as they appear here) are currently available on the CD's ""Black Progress"" and ""Soul Almighty"" on the JAD label - both are subtitled ""The Formative Years"". The original recordings (without the overdubs) are available on the 8 CD series on JAD called ""The Complete Bob Marley and the Wailers 1967-1972"". The 8 CD set is far from ""complete"" but that's another review !"
3,Hidden Treasure?,"This is sort of a hidden gem in the Bob catalogue.....now I gave it three stars so people who know his classic Island recordings don't get dissappointed....but this is a fun album, a bit lo-fi and I wasn't aware that they had overdubbed or modernized this back in 81, so its like Bob Marley's ""Crash Landing"" (Hendrix fans might've just cringed). I love this CD and not sure why they no longer make it!"
4,Inspiring.,"While it required a chapter or two before I got into the swing of this volume, and although chapters on particle physics avoided details or thorough explanations (perhaps unavoidably!), overall I was captivated by this book. It was an excellent, unbiased, and practicle treatise on the union of science and religion in society. If I had any complaint it would be that too frequently, though not exclusively, Davies ignores non-western religions in his discussion. If you are looking for a book that compells you to think about subjects you may have never considered and in ways in which you are not accustomed, this is a book you will want to read."
1,The title does not accurately represent the content.,"I searched eagerly for this book, but was very disappointed after reading it. An earlier review suggested that this book is not for students of theology. It is not for students of physics either. The saddest commentary on this book is that it does not present a cogent discussion of the relationship between theological and physical matters either. It is poorly written and poorly presented. Despite enduring interests in both topics supposedly covered in this book, I struggled to finish it, because it was so tedious. I will avoid all books by this author and the editor of this volume in the future."
2,"Descriptions of new physics interesting, but elitism rampant","Someone recommended this book to me, and I gave it a read, but found that the author was more interested in worshiping physics than in addressing the relationship between the ""new"" physics and God. I was especially disappointed in the mock conversation the author staged. It did not do much to carry his point when the conversations were obviously slanted in a manner to present physicists as totally logical and reasonable, and anyone that believes in God as an emotionally based illogical dolt. Elitism is not very flattering. I found a lot of the author's ""logic"" to have as many holes as the points he just got done knocking holes in himself."
1,Bias Was Obvious,"The confusion over faith and religion combined with the unabashed dismissal of both in favor of science was disappointing. I was expecting some bias towards science given the authors pedigree, but what I found was way beyond my expectations. It seemed as if the author was intent on proving science right by proving people of faith wrong. I was wholeheartedly disappointed, as I was looking for those areas where science and faith had begun to mesh. This book is for the person who has faith in science and wants to have that faith reinforced, as opposed to a person of faith who wants to see how faith and science are complimentary."
5,"God and the New Physics, by Paul Davies","I am not reviewing the book, but I would like to contact the author to see if this book has been translated in to Chinese; if not , I would like to do it. What would be the condition for this translation?Your truly Rev. Louis Tchang, a catholic priest"
4,Dont quit your day job,"Absolutely wonderful explananation of modern physics. Davies does a fine job of introducing the many points of recent revolutions in that area. Now the philosophy/thoelogy, that is not so good. The man is a physicist and should stay one, for his arguments and analysis in general is lacking. It is not his conclusions that bother me, it is more like his thinking leading up to them. As an avid reader of physics, and a current philosophy student, I feel a much better job could have been done in bringing these two areas together. All in all, a good book, I enjoyed it. A subject that deserves further exploration and stronger, fuller analysis."
2,If this is Heaven how could Hell be any worse...,"Presumptuous, spotty literature. I abhorred this book for several reasons. The apparent and poorly masked bias of the author begins the ridiculous journey this book takes you on. Along the way you pick up several more companions of bad writing to the tune of misinformation, faulty logic and, definately non-creative thought. After reading this book I felt cheated for my time lost in applying the continuously laborious effort to read the ridiculously assuming writing. I don't recommend you read this book unless you are in prison with a lot of time to spare and you don't have that copy of 101 tasteless jokes that you've been meaning to read when you got the chance."
2,Disappointing,"First of all the abduction in the movie is nothing like the book, what was that about. The most interesting part of the book was of course the abduction but only two short chapters are about the abduction. The rest of the book was quite boring. There was no dialog with the extraterrestrials, we didn't find out that the hell they wanted, no message, no nothing. Your better off watching the movie and reading the two short chapters in the book about the abduction. Very intersting if the story really is true but you don't find out too much in this book."
4,influential women,"Simpson provides a basically optimistic view of the ""space"" in which white, upper class women could operate, during the period in California up to 1940. You can read the book at two levels. Firstly, and simply, as a good backdrop to the growth of Los Angeles and San Francisco. The narrative helps give more flesh to a time of great urban expansion, that is nowadays often cursorily discussed. Since that expansion was in turn dwarfed by the ever greater growth after World War 2.But at another level, the book shows how while women might not have been able to hold formal reins of power, in practise, they had more leeway. It is this informal exercise of power that is well described. The merit of the book is in showing that the commonly accepted view of women having little power in that time is perhaps oversimplified. The historical scholarship demonstrated by Simpson is impressive and amply rewards the reader's attention."
3,Unpredictable and exciting but hard to follow at times,"This is an exciting read full of original sf ideas, but the conclusion is vague and doesn't make much sense. It's a good book, until the climax, then I found myself reading certain parts over and over again trying to understand them."
3,"Original and unpredictable, but kind of hazy","This is a good book; but although the finale is unpredictable, it seemed rushed and vague. I had a hard time trying to visualize some of his descriptions, but the story itseslf didn't have many flawes. This book is well worth the read because of the humanity questioning/praising moral that it contains. 3.5"
2,Another space opera.,"I did finish the book but it barely kept my interest enough for me to do so. The story does not amount to much really and there is not much of an ending at all. So much more could have been done with the idea of several aliens, one manmade construct and one human coming together in a mind meld."
2,Uncertain voice,"This book seemed to be a reprise of Golden age science fiction, in a world where technology is the saviour of all, people are ethical, honest, hard working, updated with a dash of cyberpunk mentality, with hard edges, drugs, lies and the accompanying details.Unfortunately, the visions did not meld well, leaving the story as a mishmash of ideas, with various sub-plots spawning off in various directions, and seemingly never wrapping up properly. In addition, I don't feel that sufficient detail is given to the elements of the story to make them believable. There are too many glossed over details to draw the reader in properly.The main plot (at least it seems the main plot) itself represents an interesting idea - the mind pool - but it is lost in the noise.Nevertheless, it is a somewhat interesting story, and a unique vision. It's just very hard to read."
4,Thought provoking and unpredictable.,"The Mind Pool starts with a dramatic display of power from the ""evil"" Morgan Constructs and finishes with a twist I could not have predicted. I was never satisfied with the description of exactly what the Morgan Constructs were, but then again, the lack of detail allowed the imagination to take over. The same lack of concrete imagery made the ending a bit hard to visualize, but that ending was so unique that I was too amazed to care."
3,this tv,Great TV but if its damaged YOU WILL PAY AT LEAST $800 TO FIX IT.The right screen goes black after an hour and I only had the tV for 5 years!.....
2,1080P IN TITLE ONLY,"BOUGHT MINE ABOUT 1 YEAR AGO. NO PROBLEMS SO FAR. I BOUGHT A SAMSUNG BLU RAY SEVERAL DAYS AGO AND WANTED TO HOOK UP TO GET TRUE 1080P. HAD SOME ISSUES WITH SETUP SO I CALLED SAMSUNG. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS MODEL OF 1080P CANNOT ACCEPT TRUE 1080P PICTURE. I HAVE TO WATCH MY BLU RAY ON 1080I SIGNAL. WHY THE HELL WOULD SAMSUNG MARKET A 1080P TV THAT DOES NOT GET TRUE 1080P PICTURES? I WAS TOLD THAT IT UP-CONVERTS PICTURE FROM 1080I MAXIMUM RESOLUTION. I WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS. IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN WHEN I BOUGHT IT. SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TRUE 1080P, DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!! BUYER BEWARE."
3,disappointed,"The book would be suitable for a large church with educated leadership. However, as a pastor of a small rural church, I need something much simpler, more user friendly. Thus, it has been relegated to the bookshelf."
2,Too much information,"This book was extremely detailed down to every time the word Elder is mentioned in the New Testament. It is more of an outline of a bible study than a book on the topic. Mr. Getz does make some application toward the end of the book, but then the last part of the book is application that has gone well or gone wrong for his church and their context. It is ok, but way too much information if you are looking for a book about becoming an elder and what that entails, this is not for you."
1,"Poor Study, Worse Language","I found the language, from a Christian writer, that Gene uses to demean those who oppose [ and rightly do so] his views is shocking, his book does not give any other contribution to the studies of Strauch or Viola give, its obsolete in comparison. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,It was great while it lasted,"The Macbook that I purchased was running great. I loved it, but 6-7 weeks after I bought it the screen began to flicker until it died a few minutes later. I took it to an Apple store and they said that the logicboard had died. They tried to look up the serial number to see if it was under warranty, but there was no number to be found on the laptop. I tried to get a serial number from Computer Kingdom, but they have yet to return my message. :/"
3,This item is not available from supplier,"Good vendor, but they are out of black, they ended up shipping me a white notebook as their inventory system can't read the -Black in your order. Beware, if your eally want a black then don't order this one. The laptop I got was in good condition and had extra memory, hardrive and processor power but it's not what is advertised. They where very nice about it and offered a full refund when I called but you should call the vendor directly and verify what your going to get."
4,Excellent laptop with only a few weaknesses,"The MacBook is a high quality machine with only a few flaws. It is fast, compact, lightweight, and well-designed. Have no fear about the keyboard. It's excellent, despite its non-conventional looks. The glossy screen is beautiful; despite using it in a wide range of settings, I have no problems with glare. I only have two complaints: one is that the black finish collects fingerprints rather easily. It's not bad enough that I wish I had selected the white machine instead, but it's something Apple could work on for the next revision. The last is the ""mooing"" sound that many have commented on. It seems to be a problem only when the laptop is plugged in, but it's still annoying. I've put a complete review up on techrecs.com, but the most important thing is to take a look at the laptop in person for yourself."
2,Read before buying - these computers have issues.,"Nice looking hardware, beautiful display, but very poor performance. I've had mine for 9 months and already the battery is dead and the energy system gets worse every day - it shuts down just like that, no warning.Go to the forums on the apple page and read about the common problems these computers usually have, you'll be shocked!I used to love mine, but since 2 months ago it's been nothing but a pain. I would never recommend it to anybody."

4,"Goes on greasy, but gets results","Avon's Ageless Results Renewing Eye Cream is a bit thick and greasy, but it does the job - it visibly minimizes my crow's feet and rejuvenates my eye area. The jar is very small, but if you use it frugally, it can last a long time. This product is great for my sensitive skin/eyes, which have had trouble with other eye creams irritating them. I highly recommend it."
4,A Good Biography,"This is a biography of the author's father, Ross Lockridge, Jr., who in 1948 published the novel RAINTREE COUNTY, 1,000 pages long, his only book. A few months later, he killed himself. Ross appears to have been an over-achiever who thought he'd written The Great American Novel, and couldn't stand the critics panning it. He also had tremendous difficulty with his publisher (Houghton-Mifflin), who demanded large cuts and much rewriting, under great pressure. The suicide is still a tough thing to comprehend, though, since once the book was published it was selling fairly well and had sold to Hollywood. This biography is interesting and very well written."
2,"Nice writing, not Peace Corps","Five of us, all Returned Peace Corps Volunteers, read this book together. Our consensus view: Herrera can write but the book is more about how her time in Cameroon fits in her life than about being a Peace Corps Volunteer. If you want a book that will provide a view of what being a Peace Corps Volunteer is like you should read a different book. If you want an interesting, well written book this is a good choice."
1,Land of Cliches,"I had to think long and hard about this one. Was this movie so bad, so awful, that it then became good? It lies in the intent of the writer and director. Were all the cliches scenes meant to be sincere? Was the dialogue unoriginal on purpose? Was the direction decively devoid of cleverness? There was no sense of irony that could redeem this film. But worst of all - this Sci-Fi ""action"" flick was....BORING.Bottom line - this movie is so bad, it's just plain bad. But the bigger bottom line - How these people still get hired to make this?"
1,Yuck.,"This ""film"" is beyond decription. The word awful doesn't even begin to describe how terribly bad it is. I've seen high school video projects that were better than this. The acting is piss poor, the directing - what directing?, the sets look like they're going to fall over at any moment, and the story is worse than anything you'd find in a porno film.Don't be led astray by the review above by ""Malcolm Genesis dantemontana"". This reviewer has given a good review to every film by ""producers"" Dan D'or and Phillip Jackson. An ""insider"" writing those reviews? Hmmmm? But the one thing I will tell you, ""Malcolm Genesis dantemontana"" must be deaf, dumb, and blind to think that this film deserved anything more than one star."
3,please be careful with this,"I really didn't care for this item, It kept falling off the stream of water. I'm so glad that it didn't land on one of my preschooler head."
2,"Great fun, but cheaply built","My son LOVED this sprinkler, but it only lasted us really one summer, which was fine at the time, I bought it at WalMart for $10! However, you cannot find it anymore, and the price they're asking for them both here and eBay is ridiculous. Folks, it's plastic and foam. The foam fins and top were torn up within a few weeks, and one bad landing made the plastic body crack. Also, the control handle broke within about 1 month, and the tube gets all twisted so it's hard to keep anchored.I guess it was definitely worth a summer of fun for $10......but the price Amazon & eBay sellers want for it is borderline criminal."

5,THE BEST,"I am 73 years young and have been going to the theater since I was 6. The original Oklahoma was my first Broadway show. West Side Story was my alltime favorite, I saw it about 4 times sometimes out of NYC. I wore out my vinyl record so I felt this was a welcome home party when the disc arrived. I love that the same picture is on the cover of the disc as was on the cover of the vinyl."
5,"Neither ""popular"" nor ""classical""--simply great!","Leonard Bernstein, more than any other 20th Century composer, bridged the somewhat artificial gap between ""popular"" and ""classical"" music. To wit: the transition from the Broadway show music (tracks 1-16) on this CD to the Symphonic Dances performed by the New York Philharmonic (tracks 17-25) is seamless. Columbia is to be congratulated on this inspired coupling.Stephen Sondheim's lyrics--especially the insightful ""America"" and ""Officer Krupke""--are brilliant. Perhaps surprisingly for social commentary of this nature, they have worn extremely well with time; they are just as apt now--not to mention downright funny--as they were back in the '50s.In summary, this album is everything that good music should be, regardless of the category you may choose to place it in."
3,A Revolutionary show.,"This is a must have for collectors and just occasional listners a like. With Berstiens music and Sondheim breaking on Broadways door with his lyrics, it is no wonder this show has survived. And of the two versions of this I have (The 1961 movie, and this) This is the better version by far. West Side Story is a ""modernized/americanized"" version of Romeo & Juliet and really made the public stare uncomfortably at racism and prejudices. Berstien uses music to raise some of the hairs on your neck, and Sondheim uses lyrics to make sure your getting the message. It was a turning point for Broadway, so this is an important musical. I strongly suggest this CD to everyone. Favorite Song: ""Tonight"""
5,West Side Story,It is like reviewing the bible. West Side Story is so fundemental to modern musical theater that it stands on its own.
1,WHERE'S THE WORKBOOK????,"Just purchased this video, began to watch it, and realized that it requires the ""Learn Math Quickly"" workbook. This workbook is not offered... Without the workbook, the video is useless as the video's instructor asks the viewer repeatedly to refer to it and perform tasks in it. Could be worth more than one star, but I guess I'll never know!!"

2,Light sensor doesn't work after many months.,"The light sensor stopped working after a while. Essentially, sunlight must shine directly on the photosensor in order for the light to turn off now."
4,Good information but missing something,"While Friedman somewhat addresses the environmental consequences of Western-style consumption on a global scale, this section deserves better coverage. It should be a more prominent section in the book and the facts and figures he uses to make his case should be beefed up to the level of the research he used in the other sections. Overall, a good source of information. Globalization is a strong force - how do we reap the benefits without the dire consequences? Definitely makes you think."
5,How Advances in Communications Technology and Globalization are Changing our World and Shaping History,"No matter where you stand on the topics of globalization, networking, or commercial trade, I believe this is a book everyone should read in order to appreciate the real implications of the advances in communication technology capabilities that we have witness over the last decade and how that it changed the history of the 20th century and is still changing the 21st century history as well.How politics, economy, and even education have been affected by a flat inter-connected world, for good or for worse. You have to read it and judge for yourself.This is absolutely an important topic that everyone should be aware of, and this book in my opinion helps in getting a good perspective."
4,Great book!,"Been wanting to read this for quite awhile and finally bought it, was I ever glad. Friedman tells the story well, hitting all the salient points and includind many of the minor happenstances. A great read :)"
3,Integration of Concepts,"I believe the author does a very good job of presenting an overview of major events that are driving markets today and integrating these concepts into a coherent thesis.The main drawback to the book is the redundant writing style. We know the thesis because it is the title of the book. It is well presented in the first chapter. However, Friedman feels the need to remind us of the thesis twice each page by overtly stating with incredible frequency that the world is indeed flat, or by referring to ""flatness"". I think most readers who would be interested in this material can perceive the thesis without having to be reminded of it over and over.If readers can get past this style then they should enjoy the book."
3,A fine text but verbose and with some bias,"""The world is flat"" is a fine retelling of the recent trends related to globalization. Depending on how current the reader is, many of the statements may be redundant. However, it is a good overview of the trends. Its greatest value is in the many insightful interviews with executives from some of the best known companies from around the word.I have two complaints, however. One is that the text is unnecessarily verbose. The other is that the author's solutions related to policy are heavily influenced by the bias to the left. The book loses some of its credibility as a result."
4,evocative,"This book makes you think, think hard. The pros and cons of the global village are fully explored, and Friedman comes down on the con side. My only complaint is that he talks more of the problem and less of the solutions. Perhaps that would be another book."
3,"nothing really new, but well written","Friedman's book is quite interesting to read. While there are very few new ideas or concepts presented, the book offers a broad and multi-faceted view of globalization from a human perspective. Friedman's perspective is very US-centric and thus the book becomes quite boring for a European reader after a while, even more so for an _educated_ European reader....."

3,"Well-written, Great Stories, US-centric perspective","This is an enjoyable and insightful book. There are some wonderful stories that illustrate how the world is indeed becoming ""flat"".The book has such a US perspective that the title/subtitle seems a bit misleading. For example, in a flat world why would the author be pained that his daughter thinks cars are made in Japan. And the discussion of free markets largely focuses on whether or not free markets are good for the U.S. And the history of globalisation portrays colonisation and slavery with a brief mention of imperialism. I think many nations/people of the world, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, would disagree with the statement that this stage was ""knitting the world together, driving global integration"" (page 9)For a more objective view of this global village we now live in, I would recommend ""The Next Global Stage"" by Kenichi Ohmae and ""End of Poverty"" by Jeffrey Sachs."
3,Two Books In One,"The initial long, tedious chapters should be entitled ""Technology and Globalization for Dummies."" These meandering chapters on technology are mystifying as it is obviously not his field. Much of it comes across as irritating dot-com marketing hype along with the outlandish adjectives of that period. Unless you have also ""been asleep"" while this technology came to pass, as Friedman claims to have been, a reader may find it too 1999ish (""your washer will call Sears for repair..."") - especially since much of the descriptions of the contemporary technology revolution (telephones, air flight, electricity - now that was a revolution) are straight from the mouths of tech industry CEOS (Carly Fiorna is quoted as a visionary).Later in the book, Friedman focuses on geopolitics, with empahasis on the Middle East, and suddenly we have a different writer. His expertise is obvious and the writing is smooth and riveting on the subject."
3,Very American Centric,"I ordered this book with high expectations because of who the author is, unfortunately I was dissappointed. The author, in essence, creates a story of globilzation based on a few observations of the world from an American perspective. In drawing his conclusions and discussing his observations it soon becomes clear that the author creates a storyline that creates a good dramatic fictional novel, but not a nonfiction book."
5,A Great Book About A Changing World,"I started off reading the NY Times article with a similar title that the author had published. I suggest reading that first and if the subject matter interests you and you would like to know more, then please pick up this book. The book is well worth the money and I find the subject matter quite interesting on so many levels."
5,excellent,Received in it a timely fashion and in excellent condition. I am very happy of the product I received.
2,Love The Cover (it's not the one pictured here),"But found the book itself rather boring. I tried to like it, but Mr. Friedman seemed to be trying too hard to make the reader see only his point of view, and he never tried to find out what really might going on on the other side.As for outsourcing call centers to India and how great and wonderful it is, when I called HP a couple of years ago, the operators would NOT admit they were in India, some of them had such thick accents and terrible pronunciation I couldn't understand a word, and they were NOT all unfailingly polite. All of which kind of made me question the validity of the rest of the book...Friedman definitely loves and overuses the term ""flatten"", but I'm like another reviewer - round means connected, flat means NOT connected at some point, and then you fall off."
4,"Good read, but must be approached critically","I am a long time fan of Friedman, starting with ""From Beirut to Jerusalem"" and enjoyed this book. Read it...lots of interesting data both anecdotal and statistical. There are plenty of detailed summaries of this book in other reviews here, so let me simply point out an interesting essay responding to ""The World is Flat"" by Richard Florida.The article called ""The World is Spiky"" originally appeared in the Atlantic but is freely available on the net(just search on the title) concludes that wealth and talent are actually extremely concentrated in an small number of mostly North American and European cities, along with a even smaller number in Asia, and huge parts of the world have seen very little economic progress. Not completely a contradiction of Friedman, since this urban archipelago does span countries and continents, but an interesting appendix. Worth looking at simply for the extremely compelling graphics."
4,"Paradigm Shifting, Inspiring, Poorly written","This is a fantastic book as far as content. Everyone who has enough cognition to read Harry Potter, plans to live pass the 2010s and beyond, and wants to survive comfortably MUST make the effot to read it.And I say ""effort"" because Friedman is a fantastic public speaker and a true visionary but a drudge of a write. In his apparent effort to be fresh, easy to read and sarcastic, he actually ends up telling the story in a very disorganized unsystematic way taxing the reader heavily.Still, I feel extremely grateful for his effort. He definitely reconfigured my worldview."
3,"I'm not an IT guy, but this is still a good book","I'm still working through this one. It's very interesting and eye opening. I think it's probably more riveting for someone in the IT industry, but it translates well in explaining what's going on globally. Just call Dell support and have someone in the Phillipines take control of your mouse to see what Friedman's talking about."
3,The Book is a bit Flat,"The beginning of the book is very interesting, but, the more I read the more redundancy I found and I really do not want to read the same things over and over. It was still a reasonably good book."
3,Chapter 2 is the book,"and it identifies the ten world-flatners. It's about 120 pages long, versus 470 pages the whole book (excluding the index). It was fascinating to read the chapter, but the rest of the book basically falls flat. Well, I read the whole thing, but this is meant to save you some time, because these is so much else worth reading."
3,Old Material Rehashed,"Mr. Friedman's book, while generally accurate presents no new insights or information. Watching any of the news channels will provide more information at a lower cost.Mr. Friedman's obviously superficial understanding of technology (cell phones are ""steriods"" in his world), his virtual worship of India and and contempt for those who disagree with his conclusions detract from what could have been a useful overview of the accelerating change that affects everyone.Perhaps Mr. Friedman will invest the time to truly understand all aspects of his topics and write a useful sequel. Until then, John Naisbitt, the Toffler's and Patricia Aburdene provide more balanced and better researched treatments of global change."
3,More than just a book,"Thomas Friedman writes a book that is a great guide to the people he explains as the ""disempowered"" or the ones who have not been fully encompassed by this flattened world he describes. His book also gives detail on global interactions with politics, economies and a little mixture of religion with a twist of future insight in the ending chapters. This insight can be interesting at times but for most readers it's not going to be new material.The book is often preachy, I don't believe everyone in the world wants the ""american dream"" and will step in the global playing field to get it. I do find his thoughts on maintaining culture and values in the flat world intriguing and a necessity for all.The book is mostly a promotion for capitalism which can skew the facts that are presented. If you're looking for a good book to read but with an insightful and open mind this one would be a good read."
2,Not worth buying,"Although Friedman deserves full credit for embarking on the economic world journey and for tying some global elements together to create the big (globalisation) picture, the writing style is BAD. An average XII grade kid could write better. Some would say the writing style is simple and what's wrong with that but I am forewarning you. The use of the word ""FLAT"" (over a 100 zillion times) will definitely turn you off.Overall, breeze through it at a library or borrow it from a friend, but do not consider buying it. Does not deserve the shelf space..."
1,"Old news, mistaken directions, and poorly derived conclusions","What old, well-trodden paths. Communications opening new opportunities. India investing in technology. China trying to move up the food chain. All repeated in a mantra-like, monotonous style. Such venom and conceit directed at the young Muslim men trying to get a decent education in the same universities as everyone else. Apparently, those young people are shocked to find that their countries' economies lag Europe's and America's and the rage they feel, the ""cognitive dissonance"" pushes them over the edge. What utter nonsense! According to Friedman, the loss they feel at realizing Islamic civilization is not what it used to be is a surprise. One imagines that the Romans, Greeks, Indians, Chinese, French, and British would similarly be amazed to find their greatest days are not in the present.Skip this book."
1,The World is Flat,Had to return the book. I wanted the 3.0 version but only the 2.0 was available. Too bad!!!
5,Great book,"This was a very enlightening book. Great observations on a global level regarding economic and social changes that are taking place or will take place in the 21st century. Generally very upbeat. Occasionally gets political (which is unfortunate), but those episodes are very brief and should be ignored. Well worth reading."
4,A gift for the obvious,"Mr Friedman examines things we all have seen & know of, tells us about what should be as plain as day, and still surprises with insights that we've all missed. This ""History"" is a little early as an explanation of the 21st century but it provides a good starting point for seeing into the future."
4,Insightful,"The author is sharp-witted. The book is beautifully written and has some astute observations. However, it is still a hard-read and does require a certain amount of concentration and self-discipline. If you are the type of person that gets bored easily, try the audio version. Just don't miss it!"
4,Interesting read about a changing world.,"Certainly none of the observations made in the book are rocket science, but Friedman definitely took an interesting approach to sequencing the many technology and social developments that have helped define the picture of today's global competitive landscape. The anecdotes are probably the most interesting part of the book, particularly those about UPS and Infosys."
3,Globalization is just a new word for international trade,"Friedman opines generally on how the world is flat, which is a general statement that most US readers can digest after reading the book. Yes, the advent of communication technology has accelerated the global reach of businesses around the world. However, just because businesses have offices in other countries does not make them automatically global. US business leaders must understand that technology gives reach, but not necessarily competence. The concept of culture is still key. Just because globally dispersed colleagues may all utilize Microsoft Windows does not mean that they all have the same global mindset. Friedman does present valid information, but again it is mainly from the US perspective of looking at the world through a Western lens, and not taking into account the vast majority of the world that still conduct business offline and within its own cultural context.- Dr. E.S. Wibbeke, Author of ""Global Business Leadership"""
1,This book is flat,One had to be asleep through the 90's not to realize all the very obvious points the book touches upon.
5,This Book Changed My View of the World - Must Read!,"Countries around the world are trying to develop their economies to compete with the U.S. If you haven't read about this book - I guarantee you will be amazed at how other countries are coming up to speed - and how FAST it is happening! A very frightening book if you have children due to the emerging trends on employment in the U.S., and will impact the how you coach your children on choice of careers."
2,"Good idea, bad implementation","It's a decent read, but the presentation was too loose. Felt like reading some reader's digest short story. The content was not bad, the guy definately knows what he's talking about. Sometimes I felt his style was like he was trying to explain sex to a 8 yr old kid."
1,Great for insomniacs,"This book is not very engaging and very tough to read. I'm sure if you are an economics enthusiast, it might be more interesting, but for engineers or others whose jobs are being shipped overseas or to Mexico, this is not a good book to try and read...that is...if you don't intend to fall asleep."
1,One of the worst books ever written,Tommy Friedman is a Bush and War cheerleader and happens to have been wrong about every single thing he's written about and predicted over the past fifteen years. This book is no exception with its laughably conservative solutions which have failed America over and over and over.
1,Too much information without meaningful conclusions!,Friedman stays true to his journalism background. The book contains alot of 'reporting' but no critical analysis or conclusions are made.There are other books on globalization that make for a better read.
2,"A readable book, but not enough insight","Friedman is a good writer, but his points highly debatable. I enjoyed reading the book but I think that is overrated. I think that this book is anticipating a truth that will come in the future... but today this book is not accurate."
1,The World is definitively NOT flat,"One of the most superficial attempts to capture trends in globalization. Full of buzzwords and repetitions. Friedman sees globalization as an unfettered process to ever increasing competition between regions, countries and people. The role of the state, NGOs or other forces with a potential to influence this process are nowhere addressed."
3,The title of this book should've been...,"""Middle-Aged White Man Discovers the 21st Century."" Very little new material here. This book is really what happens when you stop to think about our wired world. Now you don't have to since Tom Friedman has done it for you. He marvels at the internet. He marvels at outsourcing. It's almost as if he stepped out of a time capsule and decided to put his economics/sociology degree to good use. If you're looking to catch up to the 21st century yourself, by all means, buy ""The World is Flat."" If you're looking for original insight, look elsewhere."
2,Flat's hot. Global's not.,"Friedman interviewed a small sample of famous business leaders and takes 469 pages to make the case web related technology and the decline of communism have, 1) driven down the cost and risk of global collaboration and 2) created new markets and unveiled a big new workforce (primarily in India and China).Friedman gives this interpretation a revolutionary spin by giving it a new name. Instead of calling it ""globalization"" he wants everyone to use his word ""flattening"" instead."
1,"Overly enthusiastic and, boring.....","I managed to read a third of this book and couldn't keep on reading. There was nothing new or insightful, there was nothing that you and I haven't already known. The purpose of the book is to impose a strong sense of euphoria that the author was feeling, with little analysis on the pros and cons. It is even a waste of time to read this book to kill time."
4,The World is Flat,"What an fantastic book! Granted, it was outdated when talking about Google...but I was fascinated to learn how dynamic UPS is. It did get a little long in the tooth in parts, but I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in where our world is headed."
3,"Not bad, but highly overrated","This book is good.The first part is a very interesting history of the Internet and the major players in the ealy days of this revolution. It presents also the open source community in the software industry.But when the author is moving in the area of globalization, he tends to focus mostly on the benefits it brings (low prices, competition, etc) and barely talks about the huge pain and agony it creates in the industrial world.He does a good job at criticizing the current state of the education system in US.In my opinion this is where the book should have stopped. Unfortunately, the author keeps blabbing for many more chapters about the Islamic threat, terrorists, 9/11, etc.This book could have been half and it would have contained the same amount of useful information.And let's face it, to write a book in the first decade of a century that has in the subtitle 'A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century' is very presumptuous.Overall, totally overrated!"
2,Too Little Substance,"I had admired and respected the work that Thomas Friedman has done in his previous books. His knowledge and experience in the Middle East stood him well.Unfortunately, in this case, he is out of his league. He has limited technical skills, minimum political expertise, and a superficial approach to globolization. For example, he appears to have a love affair with India..he completely ignores the major poverty of the people, the government suppression, and many other issues while he paints a utopia in progress. His analogy of comparing economic and business trends to ice cream sundaes is rather immature, as is his constant references to his children and family.The book is much to long..he could have summerized it in a long article for the New York Times. I would suggest that if you are interested in reading this massive work..borrow a copy from a friend or the library."
5,Outstanding Book,"If you don't read another book all year, make sure you get through this one. Whatever your political views, Friedman's message will resonante with you and the direction our country must go with with respect to education, oil, technology, and job off-shoring among others if the United States wishes to remain at the top of the food chain."
3,Excellent information and interesting reading,"This is a very informative and entertaining book that is a sort of an economic version of Megatrends (remember that?). While I think that his research is fantastic and his writing is quite entertaining, I believe that Mr. Friedman could improve future writings by eliminating emotionally charged political references which [IMO] interfere with objectively writing about (and reading about) the real factors that drive technological and economic growth. More of a focus should be given to the importance of ensuring and maintaining individual rights than to which political party advocates (or practices) trade restrictions."
2,"The title says it all, so why cut down so many trees?","Tom can write. But can he write less? As a writer of his caliber, I would have expected more in fewer words. The idea behind The World is Flat is solid and accurately represents the state of today's interconnected world. Much of the book consists of interviews and stories that merely confirm similar notions of globalization and technology enabling the flattening of the world in terms of access, opportunities and communications. So, why then write the extra 600 pages? Yes, the world is flat but, thanks to Tom, it now has fewer trees too."
1,Never got the book,I thought I had bought the book but received CDs instead ... Judging by the picture I should have gotten the book... I hate the CDs !!!!! I couldn't even finish listening to the first one.
4,Worth the Listen/Read,"I found this audio very interesting. Because of the dryness of material, my mind did wander on occasion but it certainly gave me a new look on outsourcing/off-shoring, etc."
5,The World Is Flat Book,This book arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. I think I got a great deal for the book. I would use this supplier again.
4,The Book Is Flat,"Friedman is an excellent writer and analyzes the topic of globalization beautifully. Although the book is insightful and in-depth, in general it is flat. The author duplicates most of his points across the book and what could have been a 200-page books becomes much larger. I'm glad to have read this book even though it was a struggle finishing it.The author sees the world as a level playing field where all countries, companies and individuals need to collaborate to be competitive in a global economy. He explains the ten 'flatteners' that leveled the field and how the 'triple convergence' took it further.Friedman also argues on why the world could be seen as unflat and what could be done to change that. The concluding chapters discuss the Dell Theory and proposes remedies for America."
4,Makes the mind soar,This book certainly spells out what can be but what is right now happening. I found it to be very convincing but also with a slight nuance anywhere in the world and we could end up with a financial earthquake. The fact of America with all our faults and weakness expounded throughout the book makes me wonder how we ever become the nation we are though. We are leaving out one point that when these nations of people that are so happy now to be making peanuts meet up with their Walter Reuther and Jimmy Hoffa their wages will mushroom faster that it ever did in America. Then where are the next people we can promise the world to and give them nothing. Bet someone will find them.
1,"I cant tell if this guy if naive, stupid or on the other team","What a lump of coal...Written in a style that seems more interested in a company-centric style, this diatribe ode to corporate short sited bottom lines, takes a wishful thinking view on the wholesale and retail process of sending tens of thousands of jobs out of the country.The author gives brief lip service to the human tolls this process takes, always setting up a verbal best case scenario that includes more and better local jobs mystically appearing for the displaced workers this effects.Hey Tom, on the real world this process has led to double digit unemployment across the country. Take a reality check and pull your head out of your 5th point of contact.Congratulations to all the companies that have shaved a few points off the bottom line at the cost of their US former employees, and the long term well being of the country that sends out young men and women out to fight and die keeping you free."
3,Bloated Edition,The information in this book is vital to all of us. Unfortunately Friedman gives us about 150 pages of solid information and insight entangled in 566 pages - bloated with often tedious and repetitive example.
1,What about ecology and sustainable development?,"Friedman and his MNC coherts ignore the ecological damageto the air and ""commons."" Their uncontrolled and unregulatedprivatization of nature--everything from land, to water, toseeds, to timber is gravely endangering our ability to survive.Read Daniel Diamond's Collaspe before you swallow these ideaswhole."
4,The World is Flat,The original book cover had two ships and a small boat going over the edge of the world. Can anyone tell me who was the artist of this great cover and why it was suddenly changed?
2,Tom Friedman is Flat!,"Get a cup of coffee and nodoz pills.I actually never write reviews, but this guy just pissed me off.1. He should move to India or China since he loves them SO much.2. His world is flat because America allowed this to happen. Who is the police force of the world, Tom????3. Information is dated.4. His research is almost Graham Greene based. Let me see - I'll talk to some chattle in some far off corner of the world or better yet - I'll speak to some tin horn re-tread about technology and by GOD it's Gospel! Give me a break! Tom5. Furthermore - What about labor dumping, price dumping, currency manipulation and tax evasion, Tom ???? Guess it's allowed in your flat world.6. I lost respect for many people who thought this book with great!Save your money. Extend your subscription the Economist."
2,This Book is Flat,"If you've heard Mr. Friedman interviewed on NPR or CNN, skimmed an article in Newsweek or surfed the net on his subject, you've pretty much read the book. Friedman pads a heck of a lot of fluff between the first chapter and the last, saying the same thing over and over. It's as if his publisher demanded a large word count and then sent him out on the interview circuit to promote what easily could have been said in a concisely written essay. It's too bad that we see so much of this today; a huge marketing campaign goes into propping up a book that wastes too much of the reader's time. The concepts and insights are enlightening if you've not been paying attention in the digital age, but for a message about global economy, it's ironic that the medium used is redundant, padded, and required the use of so much paper."
5,the world is not flat,"having read the title of my review, you may agree with me, but, mr friedman has done his homework and has convinced me that the world is indeed flat. this book is so informative, enlightening, and, i think, well researched, it is a must read for anyone who is in business or works for a large corporation. mr friedman's words clearly describes the global economy that we are living in today and what, he thinks, must be done on an international scale to work in harmony with it."
4,the world IS flat,"This book gives an in-depth look at what is going on in the world outside the US borders. It doesn't attack outsourcing and globalization, rather it points out how we, as a nation, must use it to our advantage. Young adults, especially American citizens, should take what this book has to say to heart. This book is not about how our nation is being passed by, by other ""hungrier"" nations, but it points out that we must continue to be a nation that promotes dreams and goals. Only if we do not become complacent with our place in the world will we ever truly be able to solidify our country's future. We must not, out of our own fears, attack a world for becoming flat, but embrace it and use it as a motivator from this point forward."
5,A Fabulous Read,"I found this book to provide clear insights on global breakthroughs leading to the radical changes we are currently seeing in the marketplace. I was engaged from the first page, and found myself disconnecting from time to time to consider the impacts and possibilities which the recounted events had for my own business. The perspectives Mr Friedman provides regarding incipient changes in our workforce are simultaneously scary and encouraging. I have purchased many copies and sent them to everyone I know who is likely to be interested in or impacted by this book."
4,Worth reading!,"I think it could have been shorter than the nearly 600 pages, but wading through it, I did find some things which definitely were worth learning about. The first five years of the 21st century have indeed been remarkable and this book puts the really big things into a well-written perspective."
3,VERY redundant,"There is a LOT of really good stuff in this book. However, Friedman is SOOOOOO redundant. I suspect the ""meat"" of the book could have been written in 1/3 the pages.As a busy person, I'd rather an author NOT waste my time saying the same thing OVER and OVER and OVER again. I lost track of how many times he reiterated the windows/intel/office/fibre link as being important. I got it the first time. I was skimming by the 10th and yawning after that.There are a few technical errors (I think) in the book. But by and large, it is amazingly accurate.Matthew"
4,Long But Worth It,"This is a well written, well researched book that contains many excellent ideas and opinions. In the first 50 pages you know what the book is about and the author's point of view. The rest of the book remains interesting, but I found myself counting the pages to the end.Anyone in government or business leadership should certainly read this book. It is an eye opening view into the changing global market and the flow of jobs and capital."
4,Excellent,"I do not mind admitting that before reading ""The World is Flat"" I was hopelessly naive about how business was done in the modern world. I believed that when it comes to innovation, education and the quiet logic of success that there was North America and Western Europe and the rest was a hopeless backwater. My mind has been radically broadened to see the light now: that developing countries, due to computerization, digitization, and the empowering force of democracy are beginning to bloom as the United States did during the 1850s, 1920s and 1980s. This heartening, hopeful book offers genuine answers to the problems all people on this planet face today: tyranny and its helpmates, ignorance and poverty.The essence of ""The World is Flat"" is a lay discussion of economics, but that narrative is complemented, enlivened even, by flashes of insight into politics, terrorism, technology and human nature."
3,Mixed Feelings,"The first three quarters of this book focus on the impact of technology on global economics and I found it stimulating and thought provoking. Friedman explains very well how the society in which we live is changing and the impact that globalisation will have on us, as well as giving tips to westerners on how to survive and compete in the new world economy.It is unfortunate, however, that in the last quarter or so of the book, Friedman goes off on an extremely biased political rant that would make one suspect that he is in fact a propogandist."
3,"Informative, Political and VERY wordy","This book presents some great concepts about globalization and our changing world. It is clear however, that the author has a political agenda and spends way too much time outlining and pushing that agenda. This is a very wordy book as well, and I thought that the concepts could have been presented in a book half the length much more effectively. Thomas also is a bit confused on some of his 10 flatteners, especially regarding Netscape and Marc Andreessen. What he did not outline is the Marc stole the IP from the U of I, shunned the co-authors and has not given one red cent back to the university that he pillaged."
3,www.sportofdistraction.com,"I find it incredible that books such as these take on a political identity of their own. Of course, it's in part to the author's subscription to an ideology, and Friedman's is clearly globalization. As a result, in reviews such as these, certain individuals support the work because it supports their preexisting biases. Others attack the book for the same reason on the other side of the coin. And still others, read it in blind faith that the book includes (or considers) various perspectives upon the book being put together.I find this work disagreeable due to it's lack on inclusivity. In 300 some odd pages, Friedman should have, if he actually cared about spreading information helpful to the reader (I'm forced to assume that his goal is not such a spread), provided a comprehensive perspective (not random remarks) regarding the anti-globalization argument...as it is quite legitimate.3 stars are for effort...a book this long must have taken some."
4,I hate that things are moving so quickly...,"This book would have been a good read for me about a year ago. I look at it now and realize the information is already dated. The author relates stories about people sitting in meetings and finding answers to questions right then and there, from their wireless equipped handheld devices. This is no longer a novel idea. Internet everywhere is dubbed the steroids that are pumping up all the other world flatteners, such as outsourcing, in-sourcing, globalization, supply chaining, etc. The benefit of this book is the author's ability to view the world at work, then distill many of the processes into a single theme (such as each of ""The ten forces that flattened the world""). The expanded edition does a really good job of brining some of the concepts up to date. Perhaps version 3.0 will discuss the impact of the iPhone, WiMax, and tagging. In the meantime, you should read this to catch up on the trends which will shape the next few decades."
4,A thought-provoking overview of globalization,"On the (very) wordy side, but a thought-provoking overview of globalization, and not only as an economic force, but a societal and personal one as well. Excellent companion to Wikinomics."
2,"Trite, blase, uninsightful","I'm not going to elaborate too much, but let it be known that anyone that is walking around with their eyes and ears open, is reasonably conversant with how business is done today, and reads magazines or periodicals like The New York Times, Fortune or The Wall Street Journal will get virtually nothing out of this book.It is full of unimpressive insights and observations."
3,Oblivious to Nationalism,"Friedman reduces all non-economic social interests (religion, class, ethnicity and nation) to mere window-dressing in the mansion of motivations, and not because he doesn't recognize their power, but because he can't fit them into his scheme.China and India on the other hand, see the world much more historically and nationalistically. These ancient and modern nations are willing to suffer a little poverty for a century, if they can be restored to greatness.While Friedman only sees a sort of private mosaic, the sum total of every individual going about his or her own business in a self-interested fashion, Chinese students in the US are likely to talk about building a great nation--and finally erasing China's century-long humiliation. Motivation from humiliation is much, much stronger than motivation from materialism, but this book can't account for it because the author is oblivious to 21st century nationalism."
5,I can't put it down!,"Ok- so the theme is kinda gimmicky and Friedman likes himself a bit too much, but this recent history is gripping and fascinating. A lot of things remind of a book I just got called ""How to Take Advantage of the People Who Are Take Advantage of You,"" which I loved too, like the part about Indian customer service or how the Internet is enabling everyone to make money by doing very little. This is a great pair with ""The Long Tail"" which describes how the new economy will be based on selling a little of a lot.Friedman is a little dry, but this book is well-written and brings the last few decades into perspective with the author's ""Flatteners"". I recommend it!"
2,Wake Me When Its Over,"This book's topic, how technology is changing the world economy, is of great interest to many people, including myself. The book itself, however, would be a far better read at 250 instead of almost 500 pages. Friedman never uses 2 examples when he can use 5 (and drop an additional 3 CEO names in the process). After 3 weeks and 350 pages I threw in the towel, the first book I haven't finished in probably 10 years. Had he edited himself more rigorously, this book might have become a must read for businessmen like myself."
2,Flat Flat World,"A friend recommended this book to me. I think the author put a lot of research into this book and deserves some credit for that, but I found the book to be flat. It throws a lot of interesting data at you but doesn't keep the mind from wandering.I would like to point out that I am not an expert when it comes to reviewing a book, and that my opinion may not fit with what everyone else thinks. My friend really liked this book. He liked it well enough to talk me into ordering it all the way over here in the Philippines."
2,Redundant,"It is quite tedious to get through this tome.The author's approach to such an expansive topic is well organized and his perspective is clear. However, each section is terribly repetitive. It seems the author did not trust his readers (or listeners) to get his point after the first, second, or even third explanation, and thus he continues with his excessive expounding and legions of examples.My suggestion: try the abridged version."
2,Only his head is flat.,"Another xmas present, this one's a dud. Friedman rahs rahs the depreciation of American white collar workers with the astonishing claim that this outsourcing will be as good for them as the selling out of American blue collar workers for the last 20 years. All those higher education degrees? Who needs a Phd to flip burgers? You might need one to take the order for the burger but that job's gone to India. What a knucklehead! Fortunately the Pajamadeen blogs will soon make bloviators like Friedman unemployed at the Times - do you think Friedman will be as jolly about his own Pink Slip as he is about everyone else's? Its all good."
2,late and shallow,"Friedman wrote this book as his awakening to globalization while he was asleep. Asleep cheerleading the march to war in the Middle East, and in so doing lost audience since he writes for the NY Times. So he turns back to globalization, and like a child that walks into the middle of a conversation, he's enthusiastic about everything. I read the book not as a review, but rather for interest in cultural developments. This book was like a UPS commercial. Friedman spans the globe and this is all the insight he brings back? What of China's communist government and its people? What of India with Hindus, their cast system, and social equality? How does India and China's business system really work? What about the progress and prospects of the former U.S.S.R block? As a 28 year old sales engineer, Friedman's book is useless in helping me find my way in this world."
1,Simplistic propaganda piece,"Friedman has a religion: unbridled global capitalism. He wants us to believe that everyone benefits from globalization, free trade, outsourcing and offshoring. He glosses over dark underbelly of these trends, namely a widening of the gap between the rich and poor, and the shrinking of the middle class in the developed world.There's no question that there is a trend here towards outsourcing and offshoring. The big question is who wins and who loses.If you want the pollyanna view of globalization, by all means, buy this book."
2,Check the facts please?,"Even the simples facts are not checked. For example: LP records are claimed to be digital storage of music. Also Friedman claims that only SOAP and XML allowed applications to communicate together. Maybe he has not heard of EDI? That has been around for about 25 years.Lot of hype, lot of wrong facts and it goes on and on about the same thing never really extending or studying it further. First 50 pages would have been enough. After that it is all rerun.Buy something else."
2,"Stick to your columns, Tom!","There are some very interesting, novel, and innovative ways of thinking presented in this book. But after the first fifty or so pages, I got the point. It didn't have to be repeated, and repeated and repeated, on page after page.I think that this book could have been less than half its size and still have gotten its ideas across quite well."
5,Great book to introduce an inside to the 90's and now,This was an excellent book for someone who is ever curious about the expanding global ecomomy as a whole. As a sailor in the U.S. Navy I found the book fasinating because I not only grew up during which most of the book was talking about but I am witnessing the predictions of the book first hand. Great book all around!!
4,Required reading for IT leaders,"This book is well written, but will not provide any golden nuggets so to speak. It is a good resource for helping you accomplish the periodic self and career examination we should all be doing anyway. It is a thought provoking and a fast read."
3,Nice effort that gives away too much to corporate globalization,"""We tend to think of global trade and economics as something driven by the IMF, the G8, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the trade treaties forged by trade ministers. I don't want to suggest that these governmental agencies are irrelevant.... But they are going to become less important.""--page 183This Friedman book was a number one bestseller on the NY Times list (May 2005), and as the foreign affairs columnist for the Times, he has a lot of intellectual-literary street credit. As shown from the above quote, his analysis of globalization shows a willingness to think outside conventional boxes.[1]However, Friedman glosses over far too many facts of reality, both in the context of global corporatism and in the area of Middle East policy...For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007"
1,A book full of obvious statements,"I was excited to read a book that could shed some light on the day of age that we live in. I was looking for something with deep case studies of people leveraging technology to recreate markets and cultures. Sadly this book is not it.Instead this book a grouping of obvious statements backed up with tourist level descriptions of technology and world culture. Think ""Rick Steve's travels Europe"" and you will know what I mean. As you read the book, there are so many superficial interviews that follow the same story line of name dropping and statements of the obvious. ""When I interviewed Bill Gates.... He said there is a lot of talent in China...."" Geez what a revelation.If you keep up to date with your world events, this book will only restate every buzzword you have heard for the last 15 years.You may skip this book with no regrets."
2,What's the fuzz,I could not find too many new ideas in the first 5 CDs of the audio book. What's the fuzz???
4,A Good Summary,If you are on top of world events and a news hound such as myself you probably came to the same conclusions that are well laid out by Mr. Friedman. He has written an entertaining book but nothing in it was very surprising. It is an accurate assessment of the world state at this time and I do recommend it.
1,A disappointment,"Writing for the sake of writing makes for curst hard reading. This might have been a good magazine feature, but a book-- NOT!"
3,Okay,"I love the idea of the book, and at times Friedman is brilliant. But just like the title, the book is too easy, too thinly wrought."
1,"flater, maybe, tilted for sure.","Those rugged parts originally kept the flowing and gethering of wealth less efficiently. Once they were removed, india and china all find their way into the columnist's account.What the former colonial powers want is a herding logic: to set up a hierarching system inside the local communities in favor of the big cats. Shanghai and Bombay are nothing but the footholdings of global capitialist invasion. The peoples except the agents of the U.S., U.K. are left in the dust or the trap.The writer is no doubt a sound bite collector, but by no means a serious thinker."
1,What the true title of this book should have been?,"I thing the proper title of this book should have been ""How Greedy Corporation Make More Profit through the Information Revolution in the 21st. Century"", or ""Greed and Information in the 21st. Century."" To understand why, I think you must read ""Dilemmas of Domination"" by Walden Bello, The American Empire Project, and ""The Polarized World of Globalization (A Response to Friedman's Flat Earth Hypothesis)"" By Vandana shiva [...]By doing this you will hear the two side of the story, andWould be able to reach a more rational Judgment.It will not be fair not say that this book could be useful for greedy executives."
1,Not impressed,"I only made it half way through the book, got disgusted, and quit reading it. The author positively gushes about how great outsourcing to India and China is. Maybe when journalism (his job) is outsourced to India his opinion of outsourcing will change."
1,A Complacently Stupid Book,The American economy continues to crumble as Mr. Friedman ignores the obvious.
2,Nothing new here.,This book provides an overview of the headlines over the last twenty years that have impacted globalization. If you read the news paper and think about the stories you read there is nothing new here. There is a lack of solid evidence for his arguments and is based on Friedman's opinions instead of statistics and market trends. Friedman does do a good job linking everything together in an easy to read fashion. If you are looking for a good balanced book about globalization and how it's changing society this is not it. I would not recommend the book because of lack of research and the narrow view of the information provided.
4,Where was I when the World Went Flat?,"Was it Detroit in 1999? Working nights, on a temporary visa from Canada, to support a software implementation in Singapore?Or was it Chicago in 2004? After my IT job had moved to India and Hungary, and work was analyzing ocean freight patterns to China?Or was it last week, on a flight from Amsterdam to Stuttgart, listening to this book on my Ipod mini? Because that's when it all finally made sense.Strongly recommended for reading everyone."
2,Do not buy,"I bought this book with the expectation that I would learn something special, but I did not. Frankly, this book is full of fluff and ordinary things you already know: computer age is here to stay and outsourcing will continue.Mr. Friedman's central idea that the outsouring and computer age have flattened the world reminds me of those who earlier thought railraod links and telephone lines had flattened the world. Depsite whatever Mr. Friedman says, the world is not flat and will remain uneven.Do not buy this book: save your money for another book!"
1,Waste of reading! Don't lose your money!,"Book was BORING. I wish I could say different after reading. However, IT WAS A MAJOR LET DOWN AND LOSS."
4,Makes History More Interesting - About Globalization,"The world has become much smaller as inexpensive telecommunications have ended impediments to international competition. Now we have a smaller ""flat world"" where entrepreneurs all over the world will be empowered to act and enter the world-wide marketplace. According to Thomas Friedman, services such as telemarketing, accounting, computer programming, engineering and scientific research will be outsourced to countries such as India where English is a widely available spoken language. Much of our manufacturing will be off-shored to China. As anyone who shops in Walmart already knows, the majority of the goods for sale are manufactured in China."
3,Pretty Good,"I really liked this book. I was told I should get it by my brother who is a history teacher. I've already hated history, and this book actually made it intersting!"
1,Very interesting!,I was amazed at the quality of the book and the information in it. Purchase process was excellent.
3,A new edition could save the trees,"It has interesting facts that some of us have read in the Times and other newspapers. It has other facts one did not know and found very interesting. However, it is so repetitive that I would and could shorten it by 200 pages - easy."
1,Huge book full of banal insights and dumb metaphors,"There is almost nothing in this book that is new or revealing. The book is full of ideas others have had since 1998. The metaphors are so dumb, that I laughed at them. The author seems inamored of himself and his own insights (and the book is filled with unimportant personal insights along the lines of ""my daughter said at breakfast one morning...""). The book contains many contradictions. The metaphor of a flat world with ships falling off it is overwrought and not appropriate. To call the book ""a history of the 21st century is just dumb and pompous. Don't waste your time."
1,Unbelievably shallow!,"This is by far the worst book, I have read in the past two years or so!(actually, I could not finish it, it was so bad). Mr. Friedman presents a collection of one-line quotations from ""famous"" CEOs, linked together without any discernable analysis.If he does not bring these quotes, he brings examples, of what some companies do, again without analysis!If he does not do either, he explains the obvious, that communication today is easier, than it was 1000 years ago.This was my second attempt (after ""The Lexus and the Olive Tree""), at reading Mr. Friedman's books, but this was surely my last one."
3,Nice primer on globalization,"Although it has its problems, such as going on and on about topics just about everyone knows and being pithy to the point of distraction, Friedman's knowledge and ability to convey that knowledge in simple terms is admirable. His point, that the world is getting smaller and small, as the Internet, etc., gives power to the masses, is not quite new, but is well documented and interesting. This is a great book for anyone wanting to know what's coming up in the world economy for the next two decades."
3,Fascinating but ultimately disappointing,"This is the penultimate book on globalization in a highly wired world since the start of the new millenium. The author is a cheerleader of this new ""revolution"" in technology and world affairs and sees far reaching changes from its effects. It is, overall, a good evaluation of how the world works... but I'm afraid the cheerleading about downloading, uploading, workflows and outsourcing, etc. is more hype than reality for most people. There are still real impediments that will never be overcome, including geography, mass poverty, and human incompentence, that mean that the world will still in some measure be round in the future."
3,Needed a strong editor,"Decent ideas, but too full of run-on quotes that add little value. Ended up speed/skip reading entire chapters and likely not missing much information."
5,Fabulous book!,"The World Is Flat offers an incredibly insightful analysis of the factors affecting the business world today, bringing together technology (in a way that is accessible for non-geeks!) sociology, economics, etc. It is an exciting read, and I couldn't put it down! This is a must-read!"
5,The World Is Flat,"One of the more straightfoward, yet profound attempts at waking up America to the new Global realities. The book is written in easy to read prose with very little in the way of demosntrative verbosity. I enjoyed the book and the CD version.The U.S. has been living in a fantasy world for over a few decades, seeing things the way they were not the way they are. Friedman is trying to warn us. Query: how many warnings do we get and do enough Americans read anymore to enable this book to make an impact?"
2,Not as impressed as the New York Times is...,"This book did not impress me... although I have not finished the book and probably won't. Some of the ideas are right on target but there are some real lulus in misunderstandings. Then, I saw Imus interviewing the author and I figured if Imus liked it, it's probably good fiction at best (I'm being polite here). I don't put much credence in this book despite having done field studies in emerging markets and am passing it along to the sanitation engineer to read."
5,The most important book of the decade,"Friedman has the ability and the resources to put the world in perspective. Read what's really been happening in the world while we read ""news"" stories about Michael Jackson and Laci Peterson. This isn't Dateline or 60 Minutes, it is a thoughtful analysis of what has happened globally in the last five years. Friedman is neither for nor against globalism. He simply presents what is happening."
2,Freidman is tolerable only in small doses,"I'm at odds with some of your reviewers in that I think there is much of value in Friedman's overall worldview.But that needs a better advocate than he. The writing is muddled, the accretion of details is exhausting, and one is forever being dustracted but infelicities of expression, such as the guiding metaphor of ""flatness"" itself.If the earth were in fact flat, then one edge of it would be the furthest possible distance from the opposite edge. The sphericity of the world has the opposite implication: there are no ""opposite edges"" -- which is the point that a globalization advocate like Friedman ought to be happy to make. So his central metaphor expresses pretty near the opposite of what he seems to want it to express."
2,Disappointing,"After hearing the hype about this book I expected an insightful and revealing book about how the latest technology has affected the world. Instead, the author is no expert at all. For example, he seems amazed by the existence of on-line check-in for airline flights. I've been using this for years!Furthemore, he uses the 2nd half of the book to promote his political views. Very inappropriate in a book of this type."
1,mmm mediocrity...,"I had to read this book for my education class, and I found it to be the most redundant obvious book ever. There were a few interesting pieces of information, but overall I think that the whole book could have been summarized in a paragraph. If you want to know what the book is about you could just read the other reviews on this page. I'm sure they could save you time and money which you could spend on something else. I actually took time out of my day to post this in the hopes that you will not purchase this book."
4,Future guru?,"Thomas Friedman deserves the title of ""future guru"". The problem, as I see it, is that we tend to read his books as being ""futuristic"" whereas he is very much focused on the present, the here, the now. He is not talking about what will happen but what is already happening. I had read the previous version of this book but still decided to purchase the updated one because I was so fascinated by his material. For those of you who read the previous edition, this one has everything that was there in the old one, but it also has a greater focus on global Islamic terrorism as well as a much greater focus on ""the long tail"" of the internet economy."
5,One Important Book!,"TLF has probably written the single most important book of this century--globalization has/will supercede all traditional boundries of sex, class, race, nationality. A great, easy read.If you have children, you need to read this book to understand how to best prepare them for their future.As a side note, I find it hard to believe that I read the same book many of the negative reviewers had in hand. Or more importantly, perhaps it is because I DID read every word that I find many of their comments suspect. Particularly unfair were comments that TLF offered no solutions. While the book is mostly descriptive, there is plenty of prescriptive solutions offered up. I suspect those who found no solutions just didn't find the solutions they wanted."
3,"Well-Written, Disturbing","As an unemployed Computer Science graduate, I would say this book should be put in the horror section of the bookstore."
4,A book that all college students MUST read,This book is written in very easy English and it is an eye opener especially for American students and people. Mr Friedman explains in detail where he believes the world is going and what must happen to stay competitive.I enjoyed it tremendously.
3,Nice book,"Good book with lots of food for thought. nice thoughts on globilization. I really liked the writing style; easy to comprehend, too"
4,The Eleventh Commandment,"""Thou shall not stand idle in front of human misery.""How can the world be flat when 2 billion people in China, North Korea and Cuba cannot engage in free enterprise or enjoy freedom of speech? And what about the world's poor? Another billion, perhaps?As an admirer of Friedman's writing style I agree with him at least on one issue: Young Americans better get their act together and realize that competition is not among ourselves anymore, but against the world at large. All in all, Friedman has written another wonderful book.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir."
2,Unsupported,"Thomas L. Friedman once again fills a few hundred pages with concrete examples about how a kid in India now has the same chance of success as a kid from suburban America. Biased beyond belief until he gives a few examples at the end of his book about how the world is not so flat after all. Good for entertainment, but as an academic source, completely unsupported and misleading."
2,"Redundant, repetitive, and?","I was disappointed by this effort. Friedman is obviously intelligent and well-informed, but this book came across as a series of clunky anecdotes, arguing from a premise which did not seem totally supported by much in the way of fact. I suppose this is more typical of the journalistic style one would expect, but there did not seem to be much of substance here, or any real historical context that would give this persuasive weight. Lots of snippets by various characters, suggesting some interesting ideas, but hardly conclusive.I got tired of the constant references to the ""flat world""; finally I had to give up.Others may well find (and have obviously found) this to be a persuasive and engaging book."
1,A Shoddy Analysis,"Although I applaud books written for popular audiences intending to educate them about certain subjects (e.g. economics, astrophysics, political science, etc), this book disappoints.Friedman's analysis presents his beliefs through dogmatic anecdotes and stories, rather than through scientific rigor. For instance, he proffers that the main argument against globalization is that it results in the loss of domestic jobs to those in other countries such as India. Although this may be the popular mantra, this is in fact false. Globalization creates more jobs than are lost; the problem is that many of these jobs are lower paying. Unfortunately for the reader, Friedman does not know this and he does not address globalization's other numerous critiques (i.e. neo-marxist critiques of Western economic hegemony, environmental destruction, the unfair treatment of workers in poorer countries, demise of the welfare state in the West, etc)."
2,Flat perhaps for 1/3 of the world,"Friedman's book is full of great international anecdotes and explanations; however, I was thoroughly disappointed with his view of the flat world. Perhaps it is getting flatter for a few people in the developed world as well as some others in Bangalore and Shanghai- but other than that I was never convinced. Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the other parts of India and China are hardly mentioned at all in this book. There is one sentence he admits that there are three billion in this world who are way behind and will have a difficult time catching up, but other than he doesn't really address those 3 billion people."
1,...and so is this book,"Though it has become an immensely popular book, Friedman's work is fairly shallow and simplistic. It is important to remember that this is a world analysis written by a journalist, not by a political economist or any type of economist or political scientist. His views are oversimplified and his support relies heavily on anecdote, making his 600-pager about 400 pages too long. We read it for a poli sci class and proceeded to tear it apart intellectually."
4,good solid read,"But not as insightful as I'd like (such as Random Walk Down Wall Street,etc).A few too many anecdotes. A little too snooty. Author uses many cliches and just pounds it into your head over and over that ""the world is flat""...and that He alone discovered that fact."
1,More poorly researched generalizing by Friedman,"Friedman somehow feels qualified to make broad generalizations about the 'flattening of the world' based upon a mere 60 hours of interviews. He bases the title of his book on a statement from an Indian CEO--hardly representative of the world population he superficially claims to represent. Several careful academic studies have challenged Friedman's ill-supported arguments. For a more thorough critique, see: ""Why America's Top Pundits Are Wrong: Anthropologists Talk Back"" (California Series in Public Anthropology, 13) by Catherine Besteman (Editor), Hugh Gusterson (Editor)."
1,Where are the people? Where is the education?,"Seldom has such a well-hyped book been such a waste of time. The obvious is belabored. Technology has had a leveling effect, and international connectivity has changed the way we do business. Hello? Even George W. Bush knows that, and he doesn't know much of anything.It's a dehumanizing book as well. And scant attention is paid to education. Increasingly, we live in a world like Friedman's, where no one really needs to KNOW anything. Why learn math when you've got a calculator? Why learn spelling when you've got a spellcheck? why learn History or Literature when all that matters is Business?I like books that point the way toward light, not those that take us further into the darkness. 30 minutes spent with Morris Berman's THE TWILIGHT OF AMERICAN CULTURE is worth more than 30 hours spent with this one.I can't think of a thing in this book that someone with a reasonable amount of common sense hasn't already figured out."
5,One of the best books on globalization,This book was suggested to me by a friend as a must read and I would further suggest the same. It is very gripping coz of the relevance. As I read through chapter after chapter I could not help think of similar thoughts and relate similar experiences. Also since I am from India I see a whole generation of young boys and girls who have been impacted by this change. Infact some of my own batchmates work for BPO;s like GECIS now Genpact and Igate etc.The relevance of common information available to all is so great where today we can comment on each and everything of global relevance. The organization info is only a cc or a To away... I cant relate to an office like my mum's where people send memo's and get receipts for these memo;s and all maintain multiple copies...what a waste.The books is very readable and addictive because it gets you to think and churn out ones own experiences of an Globalized and Flat world.
5,Straight Talk,"I read everything Friedman writes because he has the ability to clearly state complex issues in terms that the average person can understand. His explanation of outsourcing jobs is important because he offers the ""upside."" Most Americans think of only of losing jobs. The only objection is that he repeats his ""cutesy"" phrases too often -- carries the ""flattening"" theme so far that I became irritated with it. Friedman doesn't overtly try to persuade the reader, but rather, he states the facts and explains consequences as he sees them. Everyone could learn from this book."
4,the world is flat,"The book is excellent and intriguing!!1 It is a must read for everybody who want to join the 21st century world or else you will be left behind. I compliment Mr. Friedman, for his contribution and awakening those who are not aware of the world has change and geographical location , political or any afiliation don't matter any more."
3,Interesting...,"...but like a previous reviewer said long winded, and definitely repititious. I can understand his examples, but so much of it seemed along the lines of ""look who I know and talk to, see how my life is interesting"". He could have come to his point with pithier examples, and less repitition. While it was a good read I found it to be too long to really get to the matter, but the last couple of chapters I just wanted to finish."
1,Phetoric yet completely AVAIL,"I've got to be honest, people are exaggerating with this book, it can be concised with:THE WORLD IS BIENG CONQUERED BY TECHONOLOGY ""."" period.I've got to admit though that it's very well written and effecient, however it's 575 pages long when it could be half page. It's not a very helpful book, but read it if you've got too many time in your hands."
2,Meh...,"Very overhyped book. Definitely did not live up to the word of mouth. Redundant, repetitious, and unfocused at times. What it lacks in coherence and clarity it makes up for in seemingly endless personal anecdotes and name dropping."
5,Here we go again,"I suppose I should just prepare a template on my computer -- to be used whenever Tom Friedman publishes a book. Every book so far -- and I've read and re-read them several times -- is an absolute joy. This new one is simply delightful, a master's take on the world as it is, and about the possibilities for progress, and pitfalls. One would think that a steady diet of Friedman's column would sate a reader. But here comes yet another book that's filled with fresh insights. And it's beautifully written. What a joy!"
3,"great ideas, could be shorter","I'm a Friedman fan and haven't missed a column in years. This book did open up my eyes to the new world we are living in, but I found myself bored with it at times. Think the book ran 100 or so pages too long."
4,Guarded Praise,"A treasury of interesting information presented by a facile writer, but flawed by lack of organization. At times the author seems more interested in showing off the extent of his knowledge than in helping the reader digest it. In his next book he should strive to create a sharper logical framework."
2,Poorly written; sophmoric,"Friedman, like another reviewer says, is good for 500 word essays but his journalist style breaks down after than into annoying pratter.And he does not compartmentalise the issues, rather he throws them all together, like a salad.A much better and scholarly book is Financial Times columnist Martin Wolff's book on globalization, which is not a cheerleader's book but nevertheless positive about globalization."
5,ONLY THINKING WE'RE #1 DOESN'T COUNT!,"It all comes down to innovation.This book is a wake-up call for America to get back into the ideabusiness before it's too late.We've become the ""United Markets of America"" where the quick money ofdistribution, marketing, and finance garners more importance than thehard work of R&D.;There's another book out there (""Cult of the Mouse""), written by aex-creative head at Disney, that offers a similarly insightful andengaging read, but goes on to suggest ways to fix the problem.Hopefully, such books can act as a GPS in helping us negotiate theparadigm shifts brought on by globalization."
5,Your Future,"If you only have time to read one book, read The World is Flat. Read it for the sake of your children and grandchildren. If you are too young to have either, read it so that you will how to prepare yourself for the challenges that lie ahead in the labor market. Although Friedman is not an economist, his advisor for this book was Paul Romer, a well-known economist from Stanford. Friedman tells many interesting stories based upon his insights which he gained from many years reporting and from interviews of numerous world leaders in government and business. He weaves all these stories together into a theme of globalization.When someone does something really well, it looks easy, and some may disparage Friedman for this reason. However easy it looks, this book is the work of a genius who can take hundreds of stories and tell the reader what it all means for their future.Friedman is an excellent writer, and in my opinion, he is the best living journalist."
1,Conclusions are obvious to the well read.,"If you are a reader of business and economic news, you pretty much know everything the book has to offer. If you never read business or economic news, then this book will seem very insightful."
3,"Great topic, intelligent reading, a little tilted","The World is flat covers a topic which is real. It is supported largely by facts and clearly points to trends which are occurring and Americans need to be educated.I did not see interviews or data which was returned from outsourcing ventures that were not successful, of which there are many. Many American companies have lost money in china. Thousands of missions have been given to foreign consulting firms that have not been completed. The benefits and risks of globalization and the emerging economy have to be balanced carefully. My opion was that the author is impressed by the rescources of other countries and a bit of a sceptic on Americas position and future in the world.Overall a good book, I'd recommend it, and I liked the way that he packaged the facts in the front part of the book."
4,Educators have to read this book,"As a country we have got to quit whining and begin to educate our young and adult population to the reality of the way that the internet has changed our world. This book blew me away. I had no idea that I was so ignorant of the way the world has changed in the past 10 years even. The information presented here is so necessary for all to know and this text really should be required reading in every high school social studies class as well as every University study for curriculum change. While I count my blessings that I am retired it still worries me to see our economy deteriorate because of ignorance to the changes that are occurring, and of course I will never vote against a man again who wants to save millions in our state coffers by using the cheap labor available to us in the other countries. You won't have a clue as to why I would say such a thing if you don't read this book. It is not an easy read, but it is a very important read."
2,Expanded? That's the last thing this book needs.,"Reading the original ""The World is Flat"" put my mind back to my college days. Not the learning part -- the part where I was stuck with a roommate that spent his time watching TV and smoking pot and truly believing that his every utterance was brilliant. My roommate's utterances weren't brilliant and neither are Friedman's, though Friedman is just as transparently self-impressed as was my college roommate. Most of Friedman's conclusions are painfully obvious to anyone who has read a newspaper in the last 10 years. The others are pulled out of thin air, based on some tenuously connected factual underpinning. Save your money and read the newspaper instead."
1,Information pollution,"All the author did is buzzwordize all the common-sense and itemize all the obvious with thick description of one plain story after another, which in turn can only reveal a flat mind...lots of information pollution and no logical thinking..."
1,Disappointing,"I love Thomas Friedman's editorials, but this book is beyond boring. There is nothing in here that you haven't heard before and it is presented in an uninteresting way. Wait on buying this one."
2,The Book Is Flat,"I kept reading. Sooner or later, I kept telling myself, Friedman will tell me something I don't already know. Alas, it never happened. This book consists of 469 pages of stuff you can read in newspapers, in magazines, or experience personally every day. Is there anyone out there who has not yet had an experience with an Indian call center? Is there anyone who is not aware that increasingly high tech jobs, and even management jobs, are being outsourced, and that the USA is falling behind in math, science and engineering education? There may be a good 100 page book somewhere in all those pages trying to get out, but it is so buried underneath the commonplace it is hard to find. It's not that this is a bad book. It's just that most (all?) people who would read such a book should already know everything that Friedman talks about, and that most (all?) of those who would benefit from it would not be drawn to read it in the first place."
5,Embrace the Flattened World,"As a supply chain professional, I found Friedman's view of a Flat World to be right on target. In fact, Friedman's book is practically a guide for those of us in the Supply Chain profession. Correspondence with supplier partners in India, China, Germany, Italy, and Wales is as easy as with those in California, New York or Alabama. The ease of this communication and the success of such endeavors is proof positive of the world described by Friedman.This book should be required reading for anyone considering a career in business. Americans are great competitors and have the capacity to overcome almost any obstacle. Rather than fear a flattened world, we Americans need to embrace it and see beyond the fear of change to the enormous potential of untapped markets. As active participants, we can shape the future of this flattened world.Grab a copy of this outstanding book!"
4,Little too much...,"Outstanding review of 20th century, author has keenly shown overall knowledge, though few aspects of american culture have been over-evaluated, it could be much less partial."
4,Most Interesting,"This is the type of comprehensive book about the world that we are going to be seeing more of. I am not so impressed with the actual contents of the book as I am the fact that the author felt it important to write it. We are going to have to start seeing things more comprehensively, and that can only be done from an historical perspective."
4,Open Your Eyes to the Changing World,"Basically, if you haven't realized the world is coming together in a variety of ways, then READ THIS BOOK. I have so many close friends and co-workers who go on living life day-by-day, without any clue, let alone some degree of comprehension of changes taking place all around them. If you know any of these socially, globally, ignorant people. Tell them, they need to open their eyes and mind by reading this book. For those of you, like me, who were ALREADY AWARE; I wouldn't recommend this book to you. It's long and drawn out, more things repeated than necessary. Some interesting facts you don't know, even though you are aware, but I wouldn't recommend reading the book for those minuscule facts."
4,Revolutionary,"Tom Friedman lays out a new view of the world, a flat one, and gives a roadmap for how to navigate it. At times verbose, Friedman gives solid evidence to support his claims. I wish he had used charts and tables to make his flatness characterisitcs and convergence factors easier to remember.This book is a must-read.Marc H. RudovAuthorThe Man's No-Nonsense Guide to Women(ISBN: 978-0974501710)"
1,Flat lined thinking,Friedman's trite book is not worthy of the hype in the media. Do not buy and do not read.
1,wELCOME to 20th cenrury!,Oh my God I feel so alone.I must be 1 000 000 mails from home.This seems to be a tragedy.How could I live in GermanyMy another house is burning downThis asters 20th century in love.This part of Alphaville's song called Ivory tower mirrors perfectly the soul of this book. I really hate this book and you should hate it too!
5,THE TRUTH IS TOLD BY THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN AND MICHAEL MOORE!,"this is a brilliant, straight-forward, and truthful book. it should be mandatory reading for every 8th grader! thank goodness we have such patriots and truth-tellers as friedman and michael moore. i love this book so much, i give free readings of it in public. THANK YOU, THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN! www.buyblue.orgwww.howardstern.comwww.newsmeat.comwww.michaelmoore.com"
3,Amazon service has real problems,"My problem is, if you look at the order when this book was requested, we ordered two copies in early August and only one arrived. Either send a refund or the book. This is getting out of hand and taken as much time to solve as that for reading the book. Two copies were ordered and only one arrived, much later than the time taken in previous orders. I am concerned with the value of your service. Please help me, Gilmores"
2,A liberal's view of globilization,"All readers should remember this book is written by a New York Times columnist, therfore, it has to bash Bush. As I read the author's thoughts about Islamic terrorists, I couldn't help but think that maybe if there was more democracy in the Mid East the terrorists would not have so much power. But since this is George W. Bush's policy it was never discussed in the book. Why not?Other than the left wing bias in the book which is irritating, it is way too long, has too many anecdotes, and just ends up being a very long, boring New York Times' column."
2,This book is flat....,"More pro-capitalist and pro-globalization nonsense than i've heard since economics class in college. We should outsource capitalism propaghandists to China & India, we have enough of them here."
1,the world is flat,"it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time.joe"
2,TEACH YOU WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW,"I read this book for one of my University classes, and I was very desapointed, because the writer was trying to explain something that we already know, and he was also very bias toward the glabalization of the worlds economy. This is not a neutral book, the good thing about the book is that it gives us lots of information. Read it only if you must read it"
2,"Timely Subject, Poorly Supported","Easy flowing style of writing about a timely subject with lots of informative examples of successful supply-chains and ""flattening"" technologies. Comparing and contrasting contemporary jargon like ""Open-Sourcing"", ""Out-Sourcing"", and ""Offshoring"" was informative. However, anecdotal information and a small amount of data provided poor support for the sweeping conclusions and recommendations for America, Developing Countries and for Geopolitical consequences of technology, free world trade and economy. Gratuitous Bush bashing, though small in amount, and praise for the Democrat's Progressive Policy Institute unnecessarily politicizes and diminishes the book by confirming the author's liberal bias. One is left to wonder how much did this bias effect all the author's conclusions and recommendations. The issues of an open trading, connected world long preceded and will remain long after GWB."
2,"No, the world is not flat, of course!","The wages of workers all over the world may be flattening, but the executive pay of their bosses is reaching to the sky. The Wealth Mountains of the upper classes (3%) are growing higher and higher over the flat fields of ordinary people. The gap between rich and poor is widening. This is not a flat world."
4,facinating,"Friedman writes on the subject of globalizationnot which is not only facinating but of great importance in today's world. His theories are well thought out, lucid and cogent. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in our evolving society. Furthermore many of his discussions have important economic undertones which need to be well understood by global businesses."
1,OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN?,"This book should be about 10 pages, the same stuff is said in every chapter over and over and over again! In one of the other ""1 star review"" somebody referred to the author as BT Barnum and I feel this is right on the money because I do feel like a sucker for buying this book! I hope they give the author's job to some guy in India and see how he likes losing his job, he's so casual about American losing their jobs! I will agree the author is smart because at this moment he's laughing all the way to the bank."
2,"Lots of anecdotes, little value","That's America, stupid. If I were Tom Friedman, I would also compile all of my unpublished interviews into a book and sell it. Never mind that the best part of the book would be a quote from Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels Manifesto."
4,Worth the Read,"The book is good. Its worth the price and nice way to get an idea of the world around us. Its a little slow in some spots and could be a little more harsh on corporations and how they are destroying our world for their person profit, but all in all...gets the point across. One complaint: Reads like several small articles expanded to fill a book."
5,"A Wake Up Call, But Not All Bad News","If you have children, you owe it to them to read this book. As you read this review, the children who will compete with your children for future jobs are completing their 5th hour of homework after school or brushing up on their English skills. They are not playing Grand Theft Auto or fiddling with their Ipods.This book explains how the world economy is changing and how that change will directly impact your future. In the past, it was enough to ensure a reasonably prosperous future just to be born in America. Tomorrow, that will not be the case. This expanded and updated version of the book includes more practical advice on dealing with the changes that are inevitable. It is interesting and quite readable...an excellent investment."
5,A look at the future of business in Ten years....,"Friedman's explores the next frontier of globalization with the leveling of the playing arena in the global arena. Think Globally, Act locally applies in the various chapter which explain how New York and India are really just a phone car away. Insight into emerging business development is prevalent in Friedman's latest masterpiece."
1,Dull,"Adding 100 pages of dullness to the most boring political analysis on the market today does not enhance this book. It is likely to win my annual ""Snooze of the Year"" award."
1,Much Ado about Nothing: Philistine Work,"Friedman is an overrated intellectual lightweight. When he's not providing ""catchy"" and cowardly slogans for say the War in Iraq (remember A War for Oil? Why not?) which have the same bumper sticker mentality or bashing the French (how original) he's making the same pathetic excuses and arguments for a corporate state capitalism and an empire already in rapid decline. His ilk are destined to put up in a museum alongside T-Rex and the other dinosaurs in the next 100 years."
1,A Bombaster and his Fools,"If you can't give me ""a brief history of the 21st century"" and flesh out its most important events in a regular conversation then this book is for you. Tom Friedman writes about things that people who read the news and have a high school education should know anyway. Somehow he continues to find pseudo-intellectual fools to buy his books, in which he never fails to talk about obvious issues and how great he is because he has lived all over the world, I congratualte him on that."
1,propaganda,This man is a shill for the global economy movement and corporate power. His viewpoint serves only a small portion of humanity-those that got shall have. The rest of humanity is left to fend for themselves. In other words this book is the antithesis of anything having to do with the uplifting of humanity. survival of the richest and devil take the hindmost. Don't buy this book.
4,REBA VIDEO,"Reba at her best loves to perform and has lots of energy to show! that thats why she has always been a favorite singer and entertainer! great video,wish it was longer"
2,Very Cool but did not last,"The transaction was great, and the product was very attractive, but was not very durable.The handcuffs and chains came off within 2 weeks of wearing the product.I would definitely use this vendor again, though I would not buy that particular belly ring again."
2,not the best spitfire doc,"I love spitfires. I love WWII books, esp I love reading about the Battle of Britain. I had no idea what this dvd was about, but had to have it. Turns out it's a dull documentary with a dull voice-over and some low-tech video footage of a few different modern day spits. Not much history and no footage from the war. There's a long section where some rich guy in florida shows off his late model spit and flies it around a bit, but that's it. It's amazing that the filmmakers could actually succeed in making such an exciting and dynamic aeroplane seem dull - but they did it!"
5,The Point! is a Classic!,"I remember this story as a child, listening nightly, lulling me to sleep! I was amazed to find a copy with such great sound! I look forward to listening to the story again and again!!!!"
5,Amazing!!!,This CD is so incredible - it's just what I remembered from my childhood. My 2-year old asks to listen to it in the car every day. I love the way it makes me feel. Harry Nilsson is truly wonderful!
5,This CD has a great point,"When I was little, we had the record and video of this. Recently, a friend got me the CD. I had forgotten how great this CD is. The songs are so beautiful, and the story is great, too. Who doesn't feel like they stand out, or that they have no ""point"" in life? Oblio, who has no point on his head, and is therefore an outcast. After a journy around the pointless forest, he learns that if everyone else has one, then he must have one too. Whenever I'm feeling down, I pop in this CD and things seem to be a little better and sunnier. And even when I'm not down, I pop it in and everything seems even better than it was before. A must for any collection. Even if you're not sure if you like Harry Nilsson, then buy this. Because you do. You just don't know it yet."
4,loved it,Been looking for this movie for years and now I have it to add to my collection of rare videos
5,Best movie ever.,I had to buy this CD because both my brother and I grew up with it. Now that my brother is a father it was only appropriate to purchase this for his daughter and pass on the tradition.
3,Poseability? Minimal.,"Beyond the poses you see in photos attached to this product, you won't find this figure capable of holding any others, as poseability is limited to the hips, shoulders and head. If you're okay with that, as I am pretty much at this price point, you should enjoy this figure if you were already considering buying it. Otherwise, you should probably take a pass."
4,"good for now, i like it actually","I bought before derma wand, the effect is ok with grade of 3 of 5 but the tip is to small that waste my time to just do all over my face and neck(actually i can;t feel it when i doing in neck). This one is good compare my old derma wand(which i will give to my sister anyway, so it will not waste of money). I like this product specially when I go home from graveyard shift, I used this for 3 minutes or 4 all over my face and neck then used my night cream(although is already morning, you know graveyard shift). I only score 4 due to I still looking forward to the QUALITY of the product, I hope it will last long enough that i spend 188 dollars*(shipping included)."
2,Bits'n'pieces,"I think many of the reviewers of this release have their minds clouded by nostalgia and sentiment. Although Guaraldi's music is pleasant enough, the best tracks on this compilation have already been previously released, AND they're in good quality stereo. The previously unreleased tracks are in mono and are mere fragments: ""Surfin' Snoopy"" is barely one minute in length, ""Joe Cool"" two minutes. The tracks have also been assembled from disparate sources so there's no flow to the album, either, and a playing time of barely 37 minutes doesn't represent great value for money. In short, this album is not one you'll be playing out a lot."
3,"The music is Good, but this isnt the charlie brown album to buy.","Vince guaraldi often gets a bad wrap from jazz critics, claiming that his music is soft and not deep enough to be considered great. I couldnt disagree with them more, after thelonius Monk he is the easiest jazz pianist to recognize upon listening to. His playing sings with a sense of joy unlike anybody else. And his best music was written for the peanuts cartoons.However, this is not the peanuts disc to get. Most of the songs while charming and fun are short and underdevolped, surfin snoopy for example is energetic and catchy, but it sounds like it is just one short riff being played over and over again for 1:30. the songs that will best bring back the Holiday memories can all be found on "" A Charlie Brown Christmas"". I would also recomend that you buy "" A Boy named charlie Brown "" if you want even more peanuts music."
3,A threadbare compilation,"The best tracks (Linus and Lucy, Charlie Brown Theme) are lifted from the album A Boy Named Charlie Brown, leaving an odd assortment of instrumental fillers that are not wholly without charm. I think Fantasy Records could be milking this particular beagle dry."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Many of the tracks here are avaliable elsewhere, and many others are not so hot. However, I found that ""Thanksgiving Theme"" alone was just about worth the purchase price. Beautiful ...."
5,Another addition to my Charlie Brown collection!!!!,"Yes, it's true. I have most of all the Charlie Brown CD's. If you enjoy these, I recommend:-Oh, Good Grief!-Charlie Brown's Holiday Hits-A Charlie Brown Christmas-A Boy Named Charlie Brown-Happy Anniversary Charlie Brown!-Here's to You Charlie Brown!I already have most of these and I could'nt be happier! Buy them! They are definitely worth it!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,An excellent collection of Peanuts music!,"Anyone who grew up watching the Peanuts specials is sure to love this collection of songs composed by the late, great Vince Guaraldi. It's guaranteed to bring on a great deal of nostalgia but it is also a CD you can play repeatedly, especially when you're in the mood for something relaxing and fun. Along with ""Charlie Brown's Holiday Hits"", I also highly recommend ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" as well."
3,A Great Nostalgia Trip,"It is wonderful to get these Guaraldi tunes. The sounds quality is the same as the show, that is to say, not great, but there is an honesty and beauty to them that perfectly match the season."
4,Love this!,Love this cd! Has all the songs from the Snoopy shorts I know and love. Some of the songs I don't know but still love the cd anyway
1,WARNING: DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE,I was very excited to receive my coin set. Too bad the quarter was defective. It has some kind of black and grey spot on it which ruins the entire set! The spot is not on the coin holder but on the coin. Never buy from this seller unless you want junk!
2,A disappointment,"Poorly designed, nothing more than reprints of selected pages from each issue. If Nest is going to do a book, I want to see a ""Nest""-y type book featuring the same wit and creativity that characterizes the magazine, not some self-congratulatory, half-baked reprint. Buy the back issues instead, don't waste your money."
3,Every Room Tells a Story: Tales from ... Nest Magazine,"Holtzman is the John Waters of interior design: ironic, iconoclastic, an impresario of the outrageous. His publication is die-cut and drilled (I thought Grant Mudford was going to punch him out for piercing his images when the two met at an LA reception for nest) but never dull. This editor has progressed far beyond conventional notions of good taste, juxtaposing stately homes and prison cells, trailers and Carlo Mollinos Turin apartment in a surreal collision of styles. As a minimalist I put down this book with a shudderÑthe riotous excess brought on an attack of claustrophobiaÑbut others may love it. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"
4,Best of Nest,"Amounts to little more than a ""Greatest Hits"" of Nest Magazine. If you, like me, can't bring yourself to shell out 10 bucks for the intriguing but fluffy mag, buy this book and save money!"
1,Displeased,"Had Amazon allowed me to preview even a single page from inside the book, I never would have bought it. A curiosity, a novelty, a cultural speciman, it may be. But as far removed from helpful or even interesting as one can get."
1,Get the old back issues instead,"First, who ever heard of NEST magazine? I think the book's subtitle ought to say something more substantial, because NEST magazine isn't even known by 99.9 percent of consumers. I've perused it at a local bookstore. Second, just go to the library and look at back issues to see these previously published homes instead of spending money on the book."
5,Find answers here,"I would like to recommend College Prowler's New England Colleges book to all sr. high school students. I'm from the Pacific Northwest, but was accepted into 4 elite schools, 3 of which are on the East Coast (Brown, Wesleyan, and BC). Fortunately for me, I ran across this guide in a local bookstore, and just a quick glance though its pages gave me the impression that this was no ordinary college resource, pamphlet, or biased review that I've been encountering in my extremely difficult task of evaluating which school is right for me. The most impressive aspect of this book is that it lets the students-from each individual college-tell their stories about what they really think about their school. There are a ton of student quotes on each school on just about every factor that a student like myself would be interested in: safety of campus, campus facilities, campus parties and organizations, local bars and restaurants, and more."
1,Poor Light,"Bought a set of these lights to mount over my washer/dryer to better enable me to see if necessary to do anything special with my laundry. Took me over two hours to mount the things. (I'm no Norm Abram) The bulb housings interfered with access to the mounting holes.Then, when I turned them on I was astounded. I have night lights that are briter than these lamps. All they are is pretty.Sorry, but I would not buy any of this company's products."
2,Megabrite undercabinet lights,maybe i shouldn't rate this yet but i amhaving the same experience as the other reviewers but since i have had these installed by an electrician - i am going to try and make them work - one light will not stay on and that happened immediately - i am ordering a replacement and keeping my fingers crossed.
1,Looks Great BUT.........,"I purchased a pair of these lights and when I got them and tried them I found that one failed to work at all (and ""Yes"" the bulb was good). The other came on when touched the first time. It also went off when touched the first time. Then it came on when ever it felt like it and would not stay off. They look GREAT and appear to be well make but the electronics inside don't function correctly."
2,Bible Alive! not quite,"I was sorely disappointed in this product from Tyndale. I own the printed format of the NLT, several copies for the family in fact, and looked forward to having this to enjoy while traveling. Instead of the highly professional presentation described on teh container it seemed more like a school play with a star trying to carry all the scenes. Mr. Johnston does a fine job but the eerie background music is often so distracting as to make listening a real chore and far from an enjoyable educational experience. There must be a better audio version for the NLT than this one."
1,and now for something completly different!,not good. thought i would get a modern translation of the bible on audio. i put in the book of revelation. and could'nt stop laughing.not at God's word or the nlt which i like. but at the presentation. it sounds like monty python doing the bible badly.i would rather hear the old king james then this. it least it sounds majestic and reverant. this sounds like a comedy skit.
