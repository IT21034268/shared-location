3,Recipes are to die for!!,"This was a cute story, but to be honest my favorite part of it was definitely the chocolate recipes. I wanted to drop everything at the beginning of each chapter and run into the kitchen and try them (or, to be honest, have a scantily clad but well-built man do it for me. He'd need to do it shirtless, because it's been so hot out lately. I'm just thinking of him, honest). This says good things about the recipes, but the fact that I was so willing to put the book down...not so much. Of course, I didn't put the book down, so read into that what you will....This book is written in a light, breezy style that is fun to read, though at times the metaphors, which are cute, do get to be a bit much. They're creative, but perhaps used a bit too frequently. I did enjoy the characters, though, and will definitely sign on to read Maria's story, when it's released as an ebook. In all, this was a perfect don't-have-to-think-too-much-it's-summer book. With a HEA. And chocolate."
4,I enjoyed this book,I thought I would be turned off by the premise because it seems a bit contrived but the author does a great job with it. She really builds fun and fully formed characters that you care about. I also wasn't sure about the integrated recipes but the help the story and they are fun!Really enjoyed this one.Books and authors I loveThe October Daye SeriesPatrcia BriggsIlona AndrewsJulia QuinnBooks and authors I likeJennifer Estep/Spider SeriesFaith Hunter/Jane YellowstoneMindy Klasky
4,Good book,Loved the book. It was very entertaining. I liked how she kept resisting throughout the whole book until sje ran out on the wedding
4,The Bride Wore Chocolate,"Fun to read and also great recipes to try. If you need a pick me up, this is the book to read."
5,"Is fate trying to tell her something? When the DJ dies of a heart attack, the priest takes off and the stor","When the DJ dies of a heart attack, the priest runs away with a back-up singer and her wedding dress is burned to ashes in a store fire you have to wonder. It's going to take more than that to convince Constance however. Determined to marry Barry Borkenstein whose name is about as exciting as he is she has one last night out with the girls and ends up in bed with Michael Vogler.He's not willing to give up on her though until she actually says I DO. And since he's just placed a ginormous order with her gift basket company she's having a hard time avoiding the sexy business man. Will she give up on Barry to take a chance on true love with Michael? Read and find out."
5,Good Buy,I purchased this toy for my neice and she loves it and plays with it constantly. It is the perfect toy for bath time. It is well worth the money.
3,A mediocore novel,"Okay, I didn't see the film and I picked this book up because I thought it would be a quick, but interesting read. It was quick, but I didn't find it all that interesting. It reminded me WAY too much of the bad movies back in the 50's. It just was flat-out borefest to me. I like Anderson's other writings but this one didn't cut it for me.I suggest this for fans of bad 50's movies or some one looking for an easy read.PARTY ON, DUDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pulpy adventure fun!,"I can't wait for the movie to come out! I was afraid that this mostly computer generated film would fall short story wise, but now I'm even more excited after reading the book. See you in line September 17th!"
1,Broken in under 2 months,"There just don't seem to be any good humidifiers out there. I was careful each time I cleaned this unit. However, the bottom plastic reservoir bowed out in just over a month's use causing the water reservoir to continually drain. This does not allow the unit to work right. Even tried rigging it with packing tape, worked for a day now completely out of commission."
1,"Small Tank, High Maintenance","After reading all the great reviews on this unit, I thought I'd found a winner. I was wrong.My first impression when I opened the box was, ""wow, that's a lot smaller than I expected."" It does a decent job of humidifying the air, but on the high setting (which you'll want to use for a normal to large room) it gulps water at a pretty fast pace. I found myself needing to refill it every few hours. Plus, this is definitely not a low maintenance item. Expect to thoroughly clean it once a week, and ideally, a wipe down more often than that.I also use a $17 Vicks unit from a local big box store and like it a lot better. Lower maintenance, longer time between fills.I sent this unit back, even though I had to pay shipping both ways and a 15% restocking fee.Don't waste your time on this one."
3,"A BIT DECEPTIVE, A BIT GOOD","IT IS DECEPTIVELY ADVERTISED FOR THE CAPACITY IS PROBABLY .5 GAL AS OPPOSED TO THE ADVERTISED 2.5 GAL, SO IT IS NOT SUITED FOR A ROOM LARGER THAN 200 SQ FT.IT IS VERY QUIET, IF YOU DON'T MIND THE GENTLE WATER GURGLING AS THE TANK EMPTIES---I ACTUALLY FIND IT SOOTHING.THE STARTUP PROCEDURE IS CUMBERSOME, AS YOU MUST DIAL THE HUMIDIFICATION LEVEL, AS WELL AS ACTICTIVATE A SEPARATE TURN ON LEVER;YOU CAN NOT BE CERTAIN UNTIL THE MIST RISES SEVERAL MOMENTS LATER, THAT YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ACTIVATED THE MACHINE.THE AESTHETICS ARE VERY PLEASING---SLIM LINE AND PLEASANT TO LOOK AT.THE WATER TANK SEEMS STURDY, WATER TIGHT AND EASY TO FILL, TRANSPORT AND INSTALL."
2,Works well but too small,"When considering this humidifier compare quanity of 2 1/2 gallons of milk....not much. This humidifier works very well....but not for very long...if you have it on high it doesn't even last 8 hours for overnight. I bought it to replace a 60 dollar cool mist one with ""permanent"" filter which gave out within 2 months. Warm mist is much better as no filter needed. Definitely should have paid more & gotten larger one."
1,"small, flimsy and already not working ZERO STAR RATING","Delivery was prompt, Thanks. But one of them is not working (electrical switch failure) and the 2nd one I purchased cracked when it got gently knocked against the bed before it's first refill. It now leaks where it cracked which I am responsible for but it also fell apart at the seam (refill end of tank) rendering it useless!! We'll stick to Honeywell humidifiers that have proven themselves more durable and reliable."
1,Unhappy Customer,"The unit has zero output (i.e., not working) after 1 month. Cleaning did not help. But it does not leak and it is easy to refill."
3,Its ok,I have a large bedroom and it does not humidify the entire room. You have to push down the start button after each time you refill the tank. I have forgotten to push the button down once or twice and then the humidifier did not work that night.
3,"Buy NEW, received OPEN BOX","The product works well after using it for one night. However, I can only give it 3 stars because Amazon sent me the open box. The tape sealed the box was cut off and replace with another tape with a different color. There is no bag covering the product as you can see the manufacture includes it when they pack their product.I am not going to ask to return because of this. But I am not happy either."
1,Only good for a coat closet.,"Unless you have a room the size of a coat closet, do not buy this product. I woke up with static cling in the morning after it had run all night. Not a good buy."
4,"Gets a Good Review for Price and Working Well, BUT it's NOT 2 1/2 Gallons","This is as big as the unit I sought to replace for my office. I think the entire product that you see in the picture might displace 2 and 1/2 gallons, but there's no way the receptable can hold even one gallon.Now I run the two identical units (except they have different names) right next to each other. They work better to kick out an exceptable rate of humidity together. So what at first looked like a cheap solution, a shortcut, turned out to be a long cut. I now have these two small humidifiers running together and the result now is good.If I had to start over, I'd spend about 160 and get a big machine with a large receptable that could direct a visible spray of mist to humidify my office nicely. But these two do fine for me for now. I can't compain because still the price was so good.I admit I like them because they're quiet.Postscript: Over a year later and using it every cold day - still working just fine."
3,Duracraft Humidifier,"No complaints on the operation....works great and puts out the water vapor quietly, but it's adversised as 2 1/2 gallons. I bought it specificly for that reason (the one I had was a one gallon). On the high setting, it will only run for about 7 hours.....not enough for a full nights sleep."
2,Not worth it..............,"I bought this same one from Target last year for my daughters room. When it is on, it does what it is supposed to do, so I guess that is good. However as others have mentioned there is a ""start"" button feature which is really annoying and I will never buy another one even similiar to it again. You have to set it to low or high, whichever you want, and then you need to push down this start button. Since the mist doesn't start coming right away it was hard to know if for sure the thing was even turned on or not. This was particularly troubling in the night when I was trying to do this in the dark so as not to disturb my child. It is virtually impossible to know if it is on or not.....you literally have to wait for the unit to warm up the water enough to start the steam feature....which can take several minutes. I prefer to just use one that you turn on, and know it is on. So in my opinion even though this unit does work, the annoying qualities of it make it not worth it....."
1,Hard Water Ruins It Quick,I have very hard water and even using vinegar in the water still it caked up. I finally just pitched it in the trash.
1,We'll never know,"Tank arrived cracked. I was fortunate to have placed several chunks of newspaper under the unit, so when it leaked, there was no damage.For an inexpensive product, it was not worth it to me to hassle with returning it to find out if the next one would work."
4,great buy,"It works really well.I would recommend buying it. The only thing is, when using highest setting, this humidifier is not the most quiet one. If you are a light sleeper - you probably won't like it. It is very easy to operate and clean, as well as replacing the water. The price is not too bad either."
3,Misleading title,"While listed as a 2-1/2-Gallon Warm Mist Humidifier, in fact its capacity is a fraction of that. Presumably the rationale for this deceptive description is that it can put that amount of water out as mist in a day, but to do so requires refillings. It is not clear at which setting, High or Low output, this claim is made, probably the former."
3,Excellent quite operation but needs more capacity,Excellent quite operation and no need for any filters. The capacity should be increased as it is not sufficient overnight to run this on the High speed. If kept on low speed there is absolutely no issue.
1,Broken when it arrived,"After reading many positive reviews of this product, I ordered one for myself. I disinfected it according to the instructions, filled the tank with water, and ..... nothing. Although the unit was plugged in and the power light was on, no steam ever emerged. The instructions say that it will take 5-10 minutes for the machine to begin producing steam, I left mine on for more than an hour with no luck. A call to the manufacturer's customer service line took ages, and they had no idea what the problem was. Diagnosis: it's broken. (Duh.) One interesting note: the service rep mentioned that these units were no longer being manufactured and that whoever was selling them (Amazon, in this case) was selling older merchandise that they had warehoused. She encouraged me to buy a ""newer"" model, though it is impossible for me as a consumer to tell which humidifier models are current and which are older. Unlike books, they don't have publication dates."
1,Two lemons in a row,"I first bought this humidifier directly from Amazon in December, but it refused to function. The power light came on but the heating element never warmed up (I left it on overnight to be certain). Fortunately Amazon's return service is flawless.I decided to give it one more try, and just received the replacement unit (again, I ordered directly from Amazon). The fill cap was missing from the water tank.No more chances from me! :("
4,Warm mist is nice!,"We purchased this humidifier with our rewards points and really didn't do much research. We needed it for our baby's nursery which is dry and was causing her problems. We have been pleased with the unit. We fill it every evening and I run it during naps and at bedtime. We have hard water so we must clean it weekly to avoid the build up on the heating element. It sits nicely on top of her dresser. My only regret is not getting one with a larger tank. Sometimes the switch that you have to press when resetting the unit is hard hard to tell if it is turned on or not. However, the unit is very quiet and does make the room feels much warmer than the rest of the house. We have had no issues with mold or anything of that nature in the unit or the bedroom. Overall, I would buy this unit again and recommend it to others."
2,Misleading Product information,"The title says 2.5 gallon humidifier ... when the product arrived I thought it was 1 of 2 shipments because it is the smallest unit I have ever seen! In addition, the water container barely holds 1 gallon, nevermind the advertised 2.5 gallon. I kept it though I used it for my kids room. I bought the Vicks brand that is actually a 2.5 gallon humidifier. It is a better buy!"
5,Well worth the price!,"I purchased this humidifier back in Nov. and have been using it every night since. I make it a point to clean it by soaking in vinegar about every two weeks which is recommended in the cleaning instructions, and I have to say, very easy. It works great, and does well enough to keep our master bedroom about 3-4% higher in humidity than what it is before I turn it on. It is a very simple but effective unit that I would definitely purchase again."
4,No Brainer,"My wife recently started a new job in the desert southwest and was complaining about the dry air. I sent her one of these and she really likes it over the various types of humidifiers we've used in the past. She says the tank is easy to remove, fill, and put back on. She likes the carry handle on the tank and the oversized cap is easy to remove when filling with water. There are no filters to clean or replace. She's been using it every night for the last three weeks and hasn't had to clean it once. Use distilled water, it cost a little more than tap water, but the mist it produces is pure and clean and no messy clean up to do on the humidifier. Oh, did I mention it is one of the lowest cost humidifiers available? The only downside if the tank is kind of small but for the price and convenience of use I've not found a better humidifier."
4,Duracraft DWM250 Warm Mist Humidifier,I love this produc although I would like it to have a larger tank. It runs very quiet.
3,Capacity approximately 3/4 gallon,"As someone else stated, the title is definitely deceiving. This is a tiny unit. I'm keeping it for now because I have a small room and only run the unit over night."
4,Works good - small capacity,I like this humidifier. It runs smoothly and quietly. I also must say that their customer service is great. I had a question for them about using the medicine cup and they have been emailing back and forth with me.The only thing I think people should realize - and the only reason why I sort of wished I had gotten a different one is that the capacity is very low. Even if you fill the reservoir completely before going to bed it still wont be able to make it through the night. This is disappointing but I imagine is simply due to its small water capacity and not to its function-ability.
4,Good Buy,"Did a lot of review reading before purchasing this humidifier. In short, I feel this was the best buy for the price! It may or may not be as quality as some $130 warm-air humidifier, but this one certainly works great for our approx. 200sq ft. bedroom. No problems as long as you follow through with cleaning it regularly."
1,It worked for almost a month.....,"and is now dead. The power light comes on, but that's it. I've tried cleaning the heating element, but still nothing.Anyone know how to get ahold of Duracraft/Honeywell tech support?"
2,Good humidity- poor quality,"I had 2 of these. The first one came straight out of the box with a leak in the water reservoir. Exchanged that for another one. The second one lasted maybe a year? I used it only when the family was ill, so maybe 20 times? It completely stopped heating. It lights up, but doesn't do anything else. I'd stay away from this model."
3,small capacity!,"This humidifier seems to work fine, but the title is misleading. I don't think it even holds a gallon of water. I guess the output can be 2.5 gallons per day if you refill it 4-5 times? It might work for a VERY small room, but it doesn't last 1/2 the night in our bedroom and it doesn't seem to do much. We would have to fill it every few hours to get the level of humidity noticably higher. We bought it to replace an old humidifier that actually holds 2.5 gallons and we were disappointed. I'll have to look for another now..."
3,OK FOR SMALL ROOM APPLICATION,"ON LOW SETTING, (EQUATE TO SMALL ROOM) IT WILL RUN OVERNIGHT. OTHER SETTINGS REQUIRE REFILLING. DOES THE JOB WHILE RUNNING."
1,junk,"Used this maybe 8 times. Unit ran dry a couple nights ago (it has a shut off). Used it last night and it shut off after 15 minutes. I use RO water so there was no build up in the heat element. Triple checked to make sure it was hooked up correctly. No go. BTW, I was getting about 5 hours on a full tank on ""high"" and about 8-9 hours on low. I can return it to the manufacturer at about $15 shipping plus give them a check for $10 ""handling"". For something I spent $25 on five weeks ago? Right. I see it is now $38...."
4,Great warm air humidifier.,"This is a small, quiet humidifier that does the job. This is our second humidifier of this size. We prefer this smaller sized tank because it is not so heavy to lift and fill. With both humidifiers working, the air is nicely moistured. This new one is absolutely silent, the older one is very quiet. I would recommend this Duracraft product highly."
4,warm water humidifier,it gives me humidity during the winter. the warm water humidity is better then the cold water humidity. it works very good
2,It was Dirty and looked a Returned item,This new product came as it was a returned item. The bottom water container container dirt. The original plastic bag looked opened. I wanted to return it because I had obviously had paid for a new item but I'm so busy to do that. I was very disappointed and it was the first time an item bought at Amazon turned out this way.
4,"Good, basic humidifier","This is my third warm mist humidifier. They just don't last very long. The cool mist ones don't seem to make the room more humid. The last one I had (which looked similar to this) lasted two years, and the rubber stopper part at the bottom dried up during the summer (when it was not in use) and cracked. My first one only last one year. I am resigned to the fact that I will likely have to buy a humidifier every 1-2 years, so I'd better not spend a lot for them. This one works well, and on the low setting, can last 10-11 hours. This setting is enough for my medium sized room. On high output, it goes through the water very quickly, and if your room is small, will feel tropical. The one thing I don't like about this one is that after putting the dial on the desired setting, you still have to push a ""start"" button to make it start putting out mist."
1,poorly engineered and deceptively advertised,"The description of this thing as a 2 1/2 gallon unit is nonsense. The tank will hold perhaps 1 1/2 quarts. The figure stated, 2 1/2 gallons, comes from the potential of adding 2 1/2 gallons of moisture per day to a room. Sure, if you fill it up five times in the course of a day! I ordered two, and discovered the deception when they arrived (one cannot tell from the fraudulent description). I sent it back and insisted that the mfg pay for shipping, else I would charge back on the CC. Moreover, the unit puts out very little moisture even on the high setting. Duracraft made better units 15 years ago. These are less than junk."
2,Damaged my wall,"This was my first humidifier, so I'm not sure if all of them would have the same effect, but...using this thing for a few nights caused so much condensation on my walls that it was starting to damage the paint. I returned it."
2,Sorry Schäfer...,This is how it is. Christine Schäfer should not sing early music. Bach is not her thing (neither is Mozart by the way). There is a huge contrast between the oustanding ensemble and the actual solo artist of the record. Her constant and sometimes hysteric vibrato is not really appropriate and she has no sense of phrasing. Christine Schäfer is a great singer but she should focus more on romantic music and leave the earlier works to those who understands how to perform it.
3,Packed full of information!,"This biography of Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, tells his life story, and includes a chronology, chapter notes, a glossary, further reading, and an index. This biography is an excellent tool for children who are doing book reports, or even for children who are just reading for enjoyment. The inspirational and encouraging story of Neil Armstrong must be heard by all!"
1,drivel,"This a masterpiece of glibness and plausability. It resides in the world of the seemingly-true and therefore, as spiritual teaching, should be avoided like the plague.Only a psychically marginalised and cathectically needy lost soul would gravitate towards such brainless piffle and that is precisely the kind of victim that Cohen is targeting. Shame on him and his arrogant deluded hubris! He has developed conceit and overweening self-esteem into a fine art."
3,"Jesse Colin Young Live ""Standing Room Only""","I must say, this cd was not what I had anticapted. I was looking for clear sound and not a lot of background noise... oh well, it just didni't happen. If you're looking for the Youngbloods or Jesse Colin Young on his own, then purchase the CD's singularly... I purchased Elephant Mountain and found all the sounds were as I remembered and as clear and crisp. The other one was Song for Juli, by Jesse Colin Young, alone, and it was also great. So, that's my advice to you fans."
4,out of nowhere,"I don't think anyone has heard of this group. However, after listening to the tracks over and over, I think that this will change. The key to this group is how the musicality of the compositions support the very soulful singing of the lyric. There is a wide range of musical styles, all with an original taste. This is a group worth hearing over and over again."
4,"Recommended to the fans only,not the 1st place to start with","Well it's not the 1st place to start with, cause You find for example better examples than this one, such as the live album ""A live record"" or their official recent lives, witnessing the recent albums of ""Dust and dreams"", Harbour of tears"" and ""Rajaz""; nevertheless you find an exceptional BBC session in this ""God of light"", regarding their famous live version of Arubaluba, from the very early period and also some excerpts from old performances, regarding some stuff from ""The snow goose"",which are very interesting and make this album a real historical document (listen also to their new anthology ""Lunar sea"",recently issued and covering the period in between 1973-1985)... talking about the remaining tracks: ""White rider"" and ""Lady Fantasy"" don't add anything new in comparison to the original ones from their studio albums ..."
5,GREAT PURCHASE,These earrings are absolutely beautiful. The diamond accents are tastefully placed to add to a unique appearance. Highly recommended.
2,Skip over these...,"This item was bought as a gift. I guess I shouldn't have expected a lot for the price, but was disappointed by the small irregular looking diamonds that seemed to distract, rather than add to the earrings. They would have been better with one row of diamonds in the center, or even none at all. The overall size of the earrings was very small, too, and likely will come barely just under the ear, instead of hanging down a little. The picture they show you online looked much better than the item I received. :("
1,simply ugly,"14K Yellow Gold Hoop Earings (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I2-I3 Clarity)photo is very deceiving, its not what it looks like in person...just dont buy at all..."
3,"Not bad, not that good.","Seemed to explain things that were already self-explanitory given the JavaDoc.Still, a nice reference for future work. This book is currently toilet-side."
2,Plenty of room but flimsy.,"I purchased this tackle box to store and organize small hobby tools and fasteners, so usage was indoors and light-duty to say the least. Despite this, I found that the latches that secure the lid shatter with even the slightest bump. It's thin plastic and there are toolboxes that cost half as much that are twice as sturdy. In light of the flaws, I would not use this for actual fishing and outdoor use."
2,really cheap,This thing is so ridiculously cheaply made. All the parts are plastic. A very soft bendable plastic. Make sure you don't leave this outside or I'm sure it will crack in the cold. Also don't lean on it because it will surely break. I did like the organization however.
1,raises price as stock goes down,"I have had this on my wishlist and recently had the means to buy it. I do sewing and this box will hold all the little bits and the 18"" ruler I need when going from client to workshop and back. However, while I'm in the process of checking out, the seller raised the price $10 from when I added it to my cart. What a rip. Will not buy."
3,HUGE!,"Flambeau seems to be a quality brand, but this was just huge! quite large and bulky, but it seemed sturdy.I went with the 3 tray version, a lot smaller and more manageable.Very likely cheaper at walmart!"
1,Item not shipped in timely fashion,"Place order over a week before Christmas as a gift. Item did not get shipped until after christmas, arrived weeks late. If you buy something and it says in stock, you would expect it to be shipped with a few days at the latest. Not satisfied with service would not buy from this vender again"
5,My absolte fav unicorn book,"The Unicorn Treasury is my absoultue fav. book. On a scale of one to 10 i give it an 11. It is made up of stories , poems, and unicorn lore that just leaves you with your mouth hanging open.This book comes out of all that ink and paper and enters the soul."
3,Roth as Kafka,This is more of a long short story than a novel. It is Roth's take on The Metamorphosis. Worth the read.
3,Kafka goes Endocrinopathic,"Mr. Roth asserts himself into the territory of metamorphosis when his protagonist awakens one morning and discovers that he has become a giant breast.While the novella is well written and provocative, the hero of the piece tries very hard to use his feminine context to assert himself in a distinctly masculine way. As a result does not manage to transcend the masturbatory, and remains a fetishistic curiosity. We can thank Mr. Roth for creating a literary stepping-stone between Kafka and later books on transformation, like Euginides' ""Middlesex"", but not for anything more."
3,"A VERY unusual movie NOT FOR EVERYONE!,","This movie isn't what I expected. This actually came sugested to me as 'suited' for me through the Vine program.Otherwise I wouldn't have likely ordered this movie, but it looked interesting, so I did.It turns out that it's not suited to me, go figure the Vine.This is a VERY unusual movie of five different segmants. ALL of which are quite disturbing.The D.V.D. case said ""It's like ""Crash"", but with crazy, perverted people"".""Crash"" had some continual connectivity. This movie does not, nor do I see any other likeness to ""Crash"".The editoral review, nor the description on the D.V.D. case prepares you for this content.It has beem repeatedly stated what the content is about,so I'll only say that this movie is for a select group that may enjoy this style of ma-cob twisted satirial excitement.This movie IS DEFINITELY R RATED OR MORE, as said on the editorial review.This is obviously NOT family entertainment."
4,They were not kidding about the twistedness!,"I probably would have given it 3.5 stars, but giving the extra boost up vs down because this is a very bold and original set of stories. Reasonable production quality with decent performances. Not sure I would have liked it if the cast was not as effective as it was. Good example of how a cast can make or break something. Some subject matter is very unsettling, so be warned. The tag line is actually the most accurate one I have ever seen!"
2,Great production for disturbing material,"If you like the perverse, this is the DVD for you. Well-acted and well-produced, but the content is disturbing (to say the least)."
2,Really I'd say this needs more than an R Rating,"Okay, I knew when I read the description this movie would be on the racy side, but unfortunately most of it was disgusting. Each story had lots of language and graphic sex scenes. I could forgive both if the stories had been engaging. Because the blurb on the back said this was like Crash I expected there to be some connection between each story, but if there was any I sure didn't see it. The characters in the stories had little redeeming qualities. I prefer characters that I can cheer on--but these were lacking. I'm sure there is probably an audience for this kind of movie, but it wasn't me. Too much grossness and creepiness for me. The quality of the actual film making was good, the actors did a good job with their parts--though I can't imagine having to play some of those characters. I love movies--but not this one.Marilyn"
4,Excellent machine,"I purchased the Spirit ZE120 after exhaustive research on the internet. I was a little nervous about making the purchase online, but I wanted to get the best for my money. I checked out machines at local fitness equipment stores and did not find a machine I liked in my price range.This is the one. The machine is terrific-runs smoothly, doesnt hurt my knees (the footpads move) the programs are challenging.My only complaints: a rubbing and squeaking noise when operating the machine and the water bottle holder does not hold a regular bottle--you have to use the one that comes with the machine.I have contacted product support at Spirit, and they responded quickly with a recommendation. If they come out and fix the problem I would give the machine five stars, no question!! The warranty is excellent as well."
5,IT WAS GREAT,IT WAS A GREAT VIDEO AND SABLE WAS THE HOTTEST TOO BAD IT'S NOT FOR SALE IT SHOULD BE. BRING WWF 1997 SLAMMYS AWARDS BACK PLEASE.
4,Comedy more then wrestling,"I thought of this as more the less a comedy show, like the ocars for wrestling, all in all though, it would have been better if todd pettingill had'nt mc'd"
5,Great book for USMLE Step 1,"This was a great book. I got it during second year of medical school. It has a lot of good cases and with Step 1 becoming case based, this was very useful. There are quesions and explanations after each case. I highly recommend it if you like to study by a case based method or if you are preparing for the boards Step I and/or II."
5,"""Mrs Ducks Lovely Day"" is wonderful","Mrs. Duck Lovely Day"" is such a delightful book. I wish the book would be reprinted so every child could enjoy ""Mrs. Duck Lovely Day"""
5,A superb novel,"This is a beautifully written, deeply engaging and, in its quiet way, highly suspenseful book. The author does everything well here. She's able to animate an astounding range of characters without ever losing the thread of feeling holding the narrative together. Highly recommended."
5,"Amazing writing, fantastic characters, wonderful story","I borrowed this from the library, but within a few chapters I went out and bought it! I simply had to own a copy to share with friends and family...yes, it's that good.The writing is spectacular."
2,Stick to Philip Norman,"Replaces Crimp and Burstein as the worst book on Sir Elton in recent memory. More a prose version of the Billboard charts than anything else (and valuable in that sense), His Song is filled with inconsistencies (see the author's interpretation of ""Chloe,"" in which she contradicts herself within three sentences), lightweight interpretations and self-styled musical categorizations. It does, though, contain some nice photos of Elton, including, of course, one posed with the author. All in all, this well-marketed and handsomely covered volume does not compare to Philip Norman's Elton John (also published with revisions as ""Sir Elton"")."
2,"Not a biography, it's a rehash of EJ's clipping service","Over the course of 700 pages (actually 475, but the font is a third smaller than normal), Rosenthal describes every song on every album of Elton John, but offers no insight into his life or artistic growth. While she meticulously footnotes every source, the sources are from newspaper clippings and magazine articles. This supposed definitive biography of Elton John doesn?t have one direct interview with the subject, his band mates, collaborators, friends or enemies. In reality, this is just a fan?s attempt at a biography, quoting the sources, but offering no interpretation. I stopped reading it halfway through; I doubt if I?ll finish any time soon."
3,sneaker rating,"This sneaker holds up well with wear, but the material used for this shoe keeps it hard to keep clean. For a child who is 5 years it was hard to keep clean from marks from normal wear from the playground."
5,Brilliant service,I will put all my comments on this page.I recieved all the Cds I've ordered. The service is BRILLIANT. I'm in the process of ordering more. Thanks so much.
5,Mike's Bluetoes Review,"Blutoes the Christmas elf is a wonderful story about an elf who does not fit in with the others; his only real friend is a penguin. On Christmas Eve, Blutoes sneaks onto Santa's sleigh so that he can see his penguin friend home safely. Bluetoes goes into to a house to keep warm while waiting for Santa. In this house there is a little boy and a little girl who are too poor to even have stockings, so Bluetoes takes of his socks, hangs them up as stockings and fills them with toys. Bluetoes is waiting outside for Santa in his bare feet, his toes turn blue and that it is why they call him Bluetoes."
2,Typical Elf Saves Christmas story,A little elf wants to help with the Christmas preparations but everything goes wrong. When he gets a great idea of where to keep the little toys for children Christmas is changed forever! Sounds better than it is. Sugary sweet story and uninspired animation make this a so-so Christmas video. Can't win 'em all.
2,Literary groupie,"Like Kafka might have said, don't bug meHaving loathed Every Book Its Reader, a work that (laboriously second-hand, bulked out with fawning interviews) I'd foolishly assumed to be atypical, I thought I'd glance at this one, acquired earlier - and what do I find? This inane flibbertigibbet, this bumbling provincial newspaperman cluttering up the study of the great Umberto Eco. A few lines of Basbanes in the morning act like a slap of aftershave round the chops. Brrr!"
4,A booklover's delight,"This book is a sequel to ""A Gentle Madness, "" also about book collecting. This book deals with the great depositories, from the library at Alexandria to the monasteries in Europe to the great modern warehouses (""library"" doesn't quite fit the bill when talking about these book-filled places). A bit too long at 600 pages, but still fascinating to book lovers. Recommended."
4,SWEET SALONE!! what a beautiful country and people!!,"Sweet Salone is now the only film of its kind that gives the viewer a real feel for Sierra Leone and its people. This film can now also be credited with helping to pressure the Sierra Leone government into creating new laws and copyright protections for its artists and music creators.Sweeping new laws and regulations regarding copyright protection and business certification have just taken effect in the country. This film is small and production values are low compared to western documentaries, but it delivers with authenticity and enthusiasm that so many others lack. A real movie about real people. beautiful and honest."
2,different than pictured; poor construction; no screw,"The product that arrived was completely square; unlike the photo for this product, it was not angled to appear more flush with the wall. Construction was poor, and there was no central screw to hold it in place, so that removing a cord would most likely result in the the adapter separating from the wall."
4,"Nice outlet-thing, but . . . (see review)","Hmm, really the only useful thing I have to tell you about this other than that the corners are squared (not so in the picture) is that it plugs into both outlets of the wall (it has two things on the back) instead of one. This can be good and bad. It's good because it means it'll be secured in a little more. It's bad because it takes up an extra outlet. But, it seems pretty nice. The connectors in the back seemed a little wobbly, but I don't know if it matters much, if at all. It works fine."
3,Children quality,Good Children classic. Follows the tradition story line with a little twist. Great Children Enterainment with the family!!!
1,sucks!!!!!,"don't waste your money . this dvd is truly awful . I was very disappointed . If I could give half a star I would and it would only be because it was brand new. reg people dressed up .... my son did not like it he did not pay any attention to it, he is 3yrs. The whole dvd Sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Lifesaver for the kids,I own the Mother Goose VHS videos. My daughters both love it so much the tapes are worn out. I couldn't find replacement videos anywhere. I am SO glad I found these DVDs!!
4,The Mother Goose Video Treasury on DVD! Great!,"Made back in 1987 as ""The Mother Goose Video Treasury"", this is the endearing production made. It features Cheryl Rhoalds as a young human Mother Goose and Will Ryan as the funny, but, often wisecracking Bertram. In the town of Gooseberry Glen, Mother Goose and her friendly ""watch-goose"" help many of the town, including the goofy Humpty Dumpty, Who falls after Mother Goose tells him to down from the wall. She comes to his aid after his ""Great Fall""."
3,Mother Goose at HIT!,"I remember this when I was young and HAD to watch it with my younger brother and sister. For some reason the title song to this collection always stuck in my head. So when I had a child of my own (she's 2) I decided to track down the Mother Goose I remember. I cannot believe I found this on DVD! My daughter absolutely LOVES these 2 dvd's. Best purchase I ever made for her. She's entertained, she loves Humpty Dumpty, she loves all the singing and she get's up and dances with the songs! I agree that the cinematography is horrible and the actors aren't so wonderful, but I remember my bro and sis loving it...and NOW MY DAUGHTER ADORES IT! I wish I could find volumes III and IV on DVD!!!!"
3,Cruddy video that kids just love,"This video is purely crud. The images are poor and the backgrounds are cheap stills. However, kids really love it! The songs will annoy most adults, but the video itself isn't a bad thing for the kids. Has a lot of dancing and song.If you get this video, be sure to buy it on DVD, because I guarantee, your kids will watch it so much, your VHS tape will wear out."
5,classic,I used to watch this video when I was a kid in the 80's so I was really excited to find it on DVD to share with my daughter. This isn't digitally remastered so the quality isn't that great but my daughter will watch this over & over & over. She loves it so much my husband & I are growing a bit weary of it but at least she'll leave us alone if we have to cook & clean.
5,excellent childrens programming,I gave this as a present and the children watch it daily and sing a long with all the classic songs. The dvd has closed caption so the children are also learning to spell and recognize words.The other dvd mother goose treasury vol 1 is also excellent and makes a great set - great for gifts!five stars plus
1,Dizzy DVD Version,"This DVD is an atrocity. I saw the dreaded warning to late, ""This movie, while filmed in multi-aspect ratios, has been re-formatted to fit your T.V."" With most hollywood flicks this doesn't matter, but for anyone who has seen this film in the theater watching this cropped version is like seeing loved ones gunned down in cold blood. I can only hope that there will be a special edition DVD that will include the entire film."
3,About the DVD release,This is a great movie and i love Greenaway.But iam very very disappointed that the viedo transfer quality is so bad.This release has the worst transfer in my over 2000 dvd collection.
5,Extremely fine cinema,This film is truly able to stand on its own in the cinematic world. It is filmed so that it mimics the reading of a personal journal (the pillow book) and the story is SO erotically charged and titillating that watching it is to experience Greenaway's vision of *sex and literature* - highly HIGHLY recommended. It's like really good sex and a really good book packed into a really great film... very thoughtful and indulgent.
1,gave me dreams so bad i threw my pillow away,"i wanted to like this movie, but i felt myself straining to hold back my urge to jump across the room, rip the tape from the vcr and toss it out the window into the passing traffic. eventually that strain turned into a masochistic challenge to see if i could make it through the entire film.honestly, this could have possibly been a decent movie if only its creators hadn't tried so hard."
1,Beautiful and Empty,"Just like most Hollywood product! This film is notable for allowing us unobstructed views of a wholly naked (and well-off) Ewan McGregor. Otherwise, its pretentious skin-deep imagery simply numbs."
5,Anamorphic DVD (What it means),"This movie is great and I will order the DVD version. I saw a review giving a bad note saying it is not in widescreen version but in standard version. The DVD is in anamorphic widescreen. It means it can be seen in Standard and Widescreen by toggling the ""Pan&Scan"" and ""Letterbox"" settings on your DVD player. Please refer to your manual for more information about this setting."
2,Weird!,"This is an artsy-farsy kind of thing. I understood what it was trying to accomplish, and it was very different, but not in a 'refreshing' way- it's just kind of... odd.Only redeeming quality is the gratuitous Ewan McGregor nudity...just kidding."
2,"A good movie, but...","...two flaws that seriously detracted from my enjoyment of this otherwise fine film:1. Vivan Wu is simply not believable as a Japanese woman. Her speech patterns, gestures, mannerisms, appearance, and attire are all wrong. She makes an excellent effort, but fails to convince.2. Two of the ""chapters"" are mixed up - i.e., the numbers as written on the bodies of the characters do not match the captions that appear on the screen. Hello? Continuity?"
4,The Pillow Book,"A stunning visual exploration of literature using the human body as paper to carry the message. Sensual, beautifully photographed, wonderful performances by the lead actors, all serving up a world in Japan that may shock people of other cultures."
3,"Excellent for first 80 minutes, then just tedious","I agree wholeheartedly with the review below that once the relationship with Jerome ends, the movie ends... and yet it keeps going, and going, and going.I love the cinematography, and the way the human form is presented and used is, for most of the film, masterful. But by the end, I was thinking more about why a movie needs this much genitalia displayed than I was about the story."
2,The Pillow Book,"Whatever were they thinking? The cinematography was wonderful. The techniques were unique and innovative. Ewan McGregor, as always, was superb - and as an added plus we get to see ALL of him. That alone made it worth watching. Vivian Wu is stunning and compelling. But even these fine actors could not salvage this story which was highly convoluted, incredibly difficult to follow and totally lacking substance. Once the very brief interlude between Wu and McGregor is over, there is little to hold your attention. I never tire of watching McGregor, however this is a film that I would gladly have missed."
2,A great disappointment,"Check out ""Iron & Silk"" to see what Vivian Wu can do when she is given an opportunity to act. Here she is saddled with a superficial script and Greenaway's chaotic story-telling. There are some striking visual images and some inventive filmic presentations, but the movie feels tediously pretentious because the characters have no depth."
3,beautifully shot,Fast forward to the part where she meets Ewan Mcgregor and stop it after he exits the film. Then you'll have an interesting and beautifully looking short film.
3,Mistake,"WARNING: This movie is _NOT_ widescreen anamorphic as the info says. This is cropped. From the movie box: ""This movie, while filmed in multi aspect ratios, has been reformatted to fit your T.V.""I give the movie 5 stars, it's truly amazing, but I give Columbia Tristar 1 star for cropping a film that not only deserves but also requires the full aspect of the original. Average it out and you get 3 stars."
4,See it,"A different sort of story. Creative. Worth seeing. Sometimes difficult to read the captions on TV. Still worth seeing. Beautiful photography. Not for children generally, but not offensive. Rare comfortablness with male nudity without being sexual or pornographic. If ""five"" is reserved for the absolute ""best"" ever, then this is a four; otherwise I'd have given it a five."
2,"The movie came on televsion, that's why I watched it.","Ok, lets get it out. This movie was strange. I get offended when I see women doing full frontal nudity especially while the men are fully clothed, but after seeing this movie, I realize that I just don't care for nudity of any kind during movies that are not rated XXX. The suicide was uncalled for. There wasn't a justification for it--if we all killed ourselves because the person we loved (... had sex with) wouldn't talk to us, the human race would be near extinction. The rejection could have been written in a far better way."
2,Ewan McGregor must have needed the money,"I once thought that any movie with Ewan McGregor in it would be entertainment. I found 'The Pillow Book' more disturbing than entertaining. It was difficult to follow, and I had a hard time figuring out just what the plot really was. The only appeal being when Ewan's pride would make an appearance next. I praise him for having the confidence to show full-frontals, yet it didn't add to the movie."
2,Ridiculously overrated,"A director tosses in some ""artful"" shots and full nudity for most of the movie and suddenly it's a ""beautiful film""???I kept expecting to see Marilyn Chambers pop up in scenes. I'm not against T&A flicks, but this is trying to be something it isn't, which is sad and pathetic. It's a cheap trashy film that gets a good reputation b/c of who directed it."
4,"Nice for insurance, but don't take it too far.","If you are gluten or casein intolerant, you know the challenges of eating out. Friends try to cook for your needs, but don't always understand fully what all contains gluten/casein. Restaurants usually have something that you can eat, but cross-contamination is such a problem as well as traces of butter, modified food starch or msg.This is where Gluten-Ease is great -- do your best to eat GFCF, and take a Gluten-Ease as insurance, just because you aren't 100% sure. It seems to help.However, the manufacturer says, ""now you can eat what you want"". Don't believe it. If you go eating pizza and count on a Gluten-Ease to take care of it for you, you are just begging for trouble.Used wisely, it is a great tool to make your life easier."
4,Great TV,"I'm very happy with this TV. I looked at the WEGA and bought the Panasonic because it's less expensive and I read too many scary stories on the internet about geometry problems with the WEGA. The picture is great, especially with a DVD player connected via S-Video. I'm not as happy with the sound as the other reviewers, it really makes a big difference to route your sound through your stereo. It's also important to remember that the delivery people will put your TV where you want it and remove the huge box and packing materials (although, as noted by another reviewer, that could be a problem if you decide to return the TV). Until I can afford a TV I can hang on my wall I think I'll stick with this one."
5,"Better than a Sony Wega,excellent picture and remote control","If your looking for a FST - Flat Square Tube, 800 lines of resolution, great multi-remote, cool and warm color settings in a 32"", look no further.This is hands down better than the Sony Wega, has 2 S-Video connections on back with RGB on front and back also - now even the Toshiba V61 and V71, Sony Wega do NOT have that. I considered those sets before I was won over by this set. Panasonic make great TV sets more than I can say for there 2.4GHz phones (which I own and despise!).This set with all the features and great remote (which lights up), can control your home A/V receiver, DVD, Video, TV, Cable box and fits nicely in your hand."
5,Nice to have a small moose to display,"I love moose and have photos, stuffed animals and other moose art work. I enjoy having this little guy to look at in a cozy little spot. The price and delivery were great too. !"
2,"Better,but not their best.","I gave this album a full listen to the other day after I picked it up from the bargain bins at Streetlight in Santa Cruz.It's better than those God awful sellout records of the 80's,but not up to the same freshness of the first two.I think the drums are mixed way too much up front and the material just doesn't push the envelope enough to get any more than a listenable,but not memorable from me."
2,she could have shared a screen credit with Queen,"I checked this album out from the public library because I loved ""It Can't Rain All the Time,"" Siberry's track on The Crow soundtrack, so much.I'm just glad I didn't buy it.Every track on the album sounds like it was written to score a poignant moment in the original Highlander movie. One might argue that the overuse of the drum machine adds a fight scene dimension, I suppose. It came out in 1990, so now I'm just hoping that she improved with age."
3,Don't waste your money,"This isn't real good value, so unless Atreyu are like your favourite band or something, skip this and get suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses, which contains 3 of these tracks, leaving only two that you are actually getting that you probably haven't got already.... It's a good cd though, each song iis good, except for one which is kinda repetitive.I strongly recommend that you buy Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses rather than this, I don't know about the new one, The Curse, 'cause I haven't got it yet!"
5,Why Bother when you can get all + more for 3?4? dollars more,You can get all these songs and more for 3 or 4 dollars more. Why bother? Just get 'Suicide Notes And Butterfly Kisess'
4,yo niggity biggity!,"yo what up dawggs... you guys should really buy both cds because this cd is kinda different than suicide notes and butterfly kisses... its still heckza good though. the only difference is the way they did the songs. for instances, tulips are better was sposda be a longer louder whisper with a harder drum line but in suicide notes they used softer drums and in the beginning every thing was more quiet. i like this version better to tell the troof. welp, i hope dis helped you.."
3,Good but not Great,"John Corey is a maverick who can't resist rubbing people the wrong way--could be integrity or just stubborn contrariness. Corey shares this trait with another DeMille lead character (Paul Brenner) while lacking Brenner's charm. The basic story is well done as DeMille is an exceptional writer. However, considering that Corey never trusts his government bosses or colleagues (including his wife), he makes several bonehead decisions/mistakes along the way that are painfully obvious to readers and which he should know could be detected. These detract from the story and are the reason for the 3 stars."
4,not bad could have been better,"this book takes a look at the plane crash of twa flight 800 over new york city. the official report would finally say that it was a mechanical problem. but this goes against what witnesses say. almost all of them report a bright light like a missle going up to the plane before it exploded.so on this premise, a husband and wife team, (one works for the fbi and the other is a nypd retired cop) who decide to investigate this on their own. they are met with threats to their lifes and careers. but nothing deters them. the book leads up to a predictable ending though. the events are set 5 years from the date of the crash and i had half of it figued out by page 50.the ending will leave you with more questions than it answers and that always annoys me in a book. it does not have enough to have a sequel, so it is like the author is teasing you with the ending that leaves you looking for more. that is why this book only got 4 stars."
2,"Very, very disappointed","I'm an avid DeMille reader. I waited with anticipation to read Night Fall. After 200 pages I told my husband, ""Nothing is happening."" I said the same thing after 300 pages and then, the ending. I smell sequel. The plot, what there is of it: a man and woman, not married to each other, have a night of sex on the beach and decide to tape it. It's the night TWA 800 went down after takeoff from JFK. What took it down? The official answer? Or, a missile? )Where's Pierre Salinger when you need him?) Did the couple get the downed airliner on their video? And was there a missile to be seen? There are some plot angles that just don't jive and you get no answer to. Why doesn't anyone question the return of Ted Nash from the dead? Or, in the world of spookdom, does that happen all the time and is status quo? The ending leaves so many questions unanswered, and I don't just mean did the missile take the plane down, that it's got to mean sequel. I was terribly disappointed."
1,Lame assed ending,"This book is an intresting mix of fact and fiction and I enjoyed the conspiracy elements. However the ending is just crap, what a lame way to end and it leaves the reader feeling completely unsatisfied. On further inspection it is revealed that the authors 24 year old son came up with the idea of the ending which only helps to leave the reader even more let down. I for one will not be reading any more of this so called writers novels."
1,I hate surprise endings,"Many years ago I had a freshman English Porefessor who taught us the fundamentals of English composition. There was a beginning, which logically proceeded to the middle, which logically led to the conclusion. Neat and simple. Mr. Demille has written a book which takes care of two of the three elements. His begginning was great, and held my attention. His middle was perhaps even better, leading me to stay up later to get to the end. The ending is a bummer and left me cold. A surprise ending is only for someone who cannot make up their own mind about where their work would lead them."
3,Crash landing,"With the exception of the virtually-unreadable Up Country, DeMille is a very entertaining writer - witty, excellent characterizations, intriguing plotting. With Night Fall, DeMille kept me aloft all the way through ... til the outrageously cheap, rip-off ending. I feel like a woman whose life savings were stolen by a con-artist lover. I feel duped."
1,Night Fall,"I have never received this product. I rank this book seller at <1. Worst Amazon transaction EVER! After communicating with the seller, I thought the problem was resolved, but it goes on... still no book after about six weeks!"
1,Other Refences to Subject Matter,"I have not read this book ;but I think ,that other people who have and enjoyed it,would like to know of two other books ""First Strike"" and ""Cover Up""-which deal with the conspiracy theory of the flight in Night Fall."
2,Great build up to nothing,"I totally agree with an earlier review that the entire book was fantastic, great storyline, great characters, great detective mystery. This is all rapidly culminating into what you think is going to be the final showdown.... when the book abruptly ends. I was massively dissapointed, it sounded like a 7yr old finished off the last five pages.I give it two stars for the quality of story telling and interesting content, however I couldn't help but feel that the ending was cheap and reading the book had been a waste of time."
4,Good Read,"As a Nelson DeMille fan, I compare all his new books against ""Up Country"" which is, in my judgment, his best. 'Night Fall"" is a superb novel by any standard, but measures a little short of ""Up Country"". Having said that, I strongly recommend the book as a very, very good read.Even though Mr. DeMille's plot for ""Night Fall"" is not as tight as most of his later works, his skill as a storyteller and a writer makes up for any plot shortcoming. Scott Brick's reading of the audio version is as good as it gets. Brick reads DeMille masterfully."
2,DeMille is a shadow of his former self.,"Nelson DeMille began his career with a series of terriffic, riveting novels. ""Gold Coast"" remains amongst my top 5 books of all time. Other novels like ""Charm School"" and ""Cathedral"" were riveting page turners.But in his last few novels, DeMille has become lazy. ""Night Fall"" is by far the worst of these and is a massive disappointment to this former fan. In the liner notes, DeMille even credits his son for coming up with the (terrible) ending when he had ""written himself into a corner"". After reading the book, it's clear why he needed help. There is no structure. No suspense, save for the single question as to what really happened to the downed plane, which is never answered.Mr. DeMille, I have great respect for you as a writer. Your early works were engaging, well-plotted, and respectful of the reader - who you always managed to stay a step ahead. As a former fan, I'd love to see you take us and your work seriously again."
4,What Destroyed Flight 800?,"The official report was that TWA Flight 800 was destroyed by an electrical spark in a gas tank. But rumors persist that some people saw a fiery track rise from the ocean and hit the airliner. On July 17, 2001, John Corey and Kate Mayfield, husband and wife, and both members of the FBI's Anti-Terrorist Task Force, attend a memorial sevice for the people that died in the tragedy. They are disturbed by the many reports of a missile, so they launch an off-hours investigation into the reports. This gets strong orders from their bosses to stop, but they continue, and we see them slowly uncover fact after fact, as they move closer to the truth and to mortal danger for themselves. The last quarter of the book becomes very intense, and Demille makes the best choice for a climax, although he passes up a chance to make the ending more exciting. Night Fall is not as exciting as Demille's The Lion's Game, but it is well-worth reading."
2,Good Story - Terrible Ending,"I have read several books by Nelson DeMille and have enjoyed them. Night Fall was a good story, but had an absolutely terrible ending. The ending ruined the book for me. I love the character John Corey."
2,The Night the Plot Fell,"I cannot judge DeMille fully because I have only read this one book. And before I send my guided missile for a review let me say that I will read another of his book, but this one ...Well, I'll tell you this: He has a knack for dialogue. Is there no end to the interviews John Corey makes? After three hundred pages and he's still going, talking with other characters about the same thing (the streak of light, the missile, the conspiracy, the streak of light, the missile, the conspiracy, the streak ...). Oh, and about eighty pages before 'Book Three' I knew where he was heading ... hint: two planes aimed at two behemoths.His plot, in this story, is his dialogue, and nothing else. The missile that tore a hole in his plot came early, probably when he sat in front of his computer screen for hours and hours trying to come up with the opening sentence. Hey, but only for this story, alright?"
3,"Intriguing book, good characters, questionable ending","I enjoyed this book up until the ending. But, I must say that given the book was ""non-fictional fiction"" there probably weren't too many ways to bring this story to a conclusive end."
3,Not the Best DeMille Book,"I have enjoyed most of Demille's other books, but I was a bit disappointed with this one. It wasn't a bad read, but not as good as I expected. I have to give him kudos for doing tons of researching on a controversial subject. However, at times the book seemed to drag. Demille seemed to hammer the same points over and over again. Read it if your a Demille fan, but don't expect another ""Gold Coast""."
3,The ending ruins the book,"I really enjoyed most of the book; at times, John Corey reminded me of Spenser in Robert Parker's books. But, about 3/4 of the way through, I was ready to find out what the government was hiding and why. Instead,the denouement didn't live up to the build-up, and I was disappointed.I realize the author mentioned that his son had helped him out of the corner he'd written himself into, but that's exactly how it struck me -- a quick solution to a complex book."
5,"Riveting, thought provoking!","I'm an inveterate, lifelong reader, (68), and have about 1,500 books in my personal library. I love to re-read favorite books; have some I must have read a dozen times.But ""Night Fall"" is impressed on my brain like I read it every day! I think of it often, and re-reun parts of it in my head. I won't go into the plot, but if you haven't read it, go find a copy and do so. It's an amazing book. The book unfolded for me like I was there on the spot, and I actually stayed up all night to finish it. Boy, it was worth it!I read so much that when I finish a book I kind of forget about it and move on to the next one, but this one has stayed with me! I just couldn't figure out how he was going to end it, and I think my mouth actually fell open at the conclusion!"
2,Suspense but no conclusion,"Once again Mark Twain's formula for an American crime writer of killing everybody off at the end is followed. This time September 11th does it, wiping out witnesses and conspirators alike. Too bad!!For almost 500 pages we surely want to know who targeted this flight and why was there a cover-up?There is much humour and suspense through-out but the essentials are unanswered."
5,Fantastic book,My husband and I both read this book and neither of us could put it down. My husband actually started reading it late at night when I finished and then he read for the entire night not stopping until it was time to leave for work in the morning. I have recommended this book to so many people and all of them have been just as impressed with it. Definitely one of the best books I have ever read.
3,DeMille Let Me Down,"John Corey's first adventure, Plum Island, was interesting, and thrilling enough to make me want to try the big Lion's Game which was outstandingly scarey. But, the second book since then has lost it's fire and interest. The ending was trite, unfulfilling and left me ready to say goodbye to John and Kate."
1,The Author Pulled Out A Gun And Shot The Plot To This Book In The Head,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! ZERO STARS!!!This book HAD everything going for it up until the last 6 pages. That's all it took for the author to pull out the biggest Deus Ex Machina in recent American history. On top of this pathetic literary device, the author threw in exploitations of not one, but TWO tragedies.I was wrapped up in a lie for the first 479 pages. I could hear the 800-pound gorilla settling into the chair beside me as soon as the epilogue ended and the main story began. I knew 100 pages out that everything was closing in on the plot. I had hopes that the 800-pound wouldn't ruin the ending. So why am I complaining? Because I wasted a week of late night reading on this book. The 800-pound gorilla stood up and choked the life out of the plot.What a despicable use of actual lives to sell this fictional garbage."
1,RIP Nelson Demille...Part 2,"I totally agree with harleys review....As a fan of Demille's books and have read em all, this one really stinks....I was disappointed with his last book, Up Country, and this one is no better....It's basically Corey walking around, finding clues that the whole FBI could'nt find. He's conviently shipped to Yemen, and the ending is very predictable. This book feels like he just putting out any crap based on his previous works....Plum Island and the Lion's game the best of his writing. I will not by his next book simply because it's a Demille book. Very poor effort, Nelson, try harder next time"
2,Did he not have an ending when he wrote this?,"This book was terrific! Until the end....... It was like he had no end for his story and just threw in a completely gratuitous take on the Trade Centers. I was literally yelling at the book ""Are you kidding me?????""Do yourselves a favor and create your own ending......"
3,Could Have Been a 5-Star,"This work of fiction (hmmmm?) was so incredibly rivating, so very well written...and then poof! NO ENDING. It's as if the author got called to dinner. What a shame."
4,A DeMille Fan---but a little disappointed,I am a big Nelson DeMille fan and have been looking forward to the release of this book. Was it fun to read? Yes! Was I glad I read it? Yes! Was it his best? No! I knew the ending about half way through the book....plus I hate it when a character is resurrected from the dead. It was fun to read...but definitely not one of his best. More of a James Patterson than a Tom Clancy.
3,Good Enough,"While not one of his best -- my favorite, Word of Honor -- Night Fall is certainly worth the read. The author is to be commended for writing a modern, contemporary book. Although the ending is obvious way too early. Maybe that makes the book all the better though, as the hero and the reader march to this fateful end? So-so DeMille is so much better than most everyone else in this genre."
1,Lousy Ending,"Imagine a fun, fact-based thriller without the climactic conclusion. The story builds and builds and, and . . . . nothing. The End. Are you kidding me?"
1,What a cop-out,"The theme of this book interested me, because I was one of the hundreds who witnessed the terrible explosion and may or may not have glimpsed streaks of light. I'm happy with the official explanation, but was prepared to go along with de Mille's proposal that a missile could have been involved, and that various governmental agencies hushed it up. But, if they did -- as the plot theorizes -- WHY? What was the point? I waded through yards of the protagonist's stupid and occasionally amusing wisecracks, kept going with a really rather easily put-down book, just to find out the answer to the mystery. And did I get it? No, I did not. Using a tragedy of the magnitude of 9/11 to cover up the author's inability to come up with a gripping, plausible ending was mildly criminal, in my candid opinion. Well, I certainly felt robbed."
1,Sleazy cop out,"I have always like Mr. DeMille's work, until this book. What a cheap and pathetic ending."
1,"Terrible plot, useless ending","The plot (or lack of a plot) in this book in terrible. It's more of a random set of spew typed into a word processor. The book spends hundreds of pages describing an hour in time, has a bunch of random things happen, the 'I' character babbles semi-macho nonsense.The ending in completely useless and a total rip-off. It was as if the author couldn't figure out how to end the book, so he didn't have to work to tie the plot together.I read the book at the same time a friend and my mother-in-law read the book. We all got together over lunch when we finished the book. We all looked at each other and said, ""that was the biggest waste of 500 pages I've ever read."" It was unanimous that this book is terrible.If you want the macho main character, go buy a Robert Parker book. If you want a cop story, go buy a Michael Connoley book. If you want the overly flip lead character, go buy a Robert Crais book. Just don't waste your money on this book."
2,Disappointed,"Chapter 1 grabs your attention when two people inadvertently witness and video tape the crash of TWA 800. However, from Chapter 2 to 20, I had a difficult time staying with the book. How many times can you talk about 200 witnesses that saw a streak of light going UP to the plane. As it was the only book I had with me on a trip, I continued. Finally, it became engrossing when John Corey starts investigating the crash by going to the Bayview Hotel (Chapter 23). When Corey returns from Yemen in September, it was obvious that the ending was going to involve September 11th. The ending had no resolution regarding the TWA flight and the conspiracy, as I suppose the author intended, so I felt the book was a waste of time."
2,Shallow,A disappointing DeMille book is a rarity but I am afraid this one does not meet the standards of the author's other books. The most improbable story is really based on some serious research of TVA's flight 800 crash but the entire book is dialogue and for me without substance of characters.
3,Night Fall,"I am a great fan of Nelson Demille. His main character could be a stand up comic and the writing is cutting edge. This book is not up to par with the wit of "" Gold Coast"" ,my favorite, or as exciting as the "" Charm School"" or "" The Lion's Game"".The main reason for my displeasure is that I was greatly upset by the editorial reviews posted on Amazon - such as those of Jane Adams- which totally gave away the plot. As a result, reading the last half of the book was an anticlimax.Why not just review a murder mystery and give us the name of the killer, so we will not even have to open the book ?Sidney Richman"
3,"Great book/rotten, anticlimactic ending","First, let me say that, like the other 5 DeMille novels I've read, I couldn't put this book down, despite what I consider to be the biggest cop-out ending ever written. From beginning to about 20 pages from the end, there is great character development, stellar storyline, and plenty of suspense. It sucks you in, and then, just when you think of 3 possible ways that the storyline could resolve itself...DeMille quits writing cold turkey.Without giving away anything, the ending is hollow and empty. I am left feeling abandoned, like I just wasted a week of my life.Tsk, tsk, tsk. I'm now rethinking my decision to read The Gate House...at all."
2,Night Fall - A Disappointment,"After reading ""Plum Island"" and ""Upcountry,"" this book was a real disappointment. The characters are weakly drawn, the plot challenges any concept of verisimilitude (is there any reason why the FBI and CIA would conspire to hide the truth of TWA Flt. 800's crash?) and the ending (the idea for which the author attributes to his son) is a total copout."
3,"Good dialogue, good plot, flat ending.","Talk about chickening out! The book started out nicely enough with engaging characters and witty conversation. The plot was interesting and plausible. The suspense rose to a really nice crescendo but totally and completely fell flat at the end and used 9/11 (yes, I don't mind spoiling this one for you because I feel cheated and you will too) as an ""excuse"" to kill everyone off so that a resolution was not needed. I still don't know who the baddies are/were and whether the controversy held weight. Ah well...get this one from a second-hand book store and then sell it back! Squandered potential!!!"
3,Great foreplay but no sizzling climax,"Nelson DeMille is a terrific writer. Some of his books are incredibly hard to put down, including the prequel ""The Lion Game."" That said, this novel was exciting to read and the story just propels itself. That is, until the ending.The ending was extremely disappointing. I don't want to give away anything, but let me give an analogy. Suppose Agatha Christie had gathered all her suspects in a room with a hint that someone will deliver a theory that would be earthshattering, and that the murderer will be unmasked. Suppose then that right before the denouement, an explosion occurs killing all suspects, destroying all evidence, no theories expounded upon, and the author declares, ""The End"". Well, such was the ending of ""Night Fall.""It was an exciting novel but the ending was unsatisfying."
1,Stop cheating the reader,"A crime story needs a proper ending. After working through almost 600 pages, I feel insulted when the author leaves the ending not only open, but unclosable. I'm not buying anything from Nelson DeMille again."
2,Ending Makes Reading The Book a Waste of Time,"Sadly, while there is a lot I would like to say to recommend this book to readers, the ending is so poor that I actually felt ""ripped off"" by the entire experience.Not only was the ending telegraphed throughout the earlier chapters of the book but just when the final good guy/bad guy confrontation is going to happen...disaster strikes and nothing is actually resolved...instead the book ends and we are presented with an invitation to peruse text from his next book ""Plum Island""...unless any of his follow-on books are given to me for free I will never read them...check that, even THEN I wouldn't read them.I simply cannot give more money or time to support a crass example of easy-out writing that would make even a thirteen year old writer red with embarassment had he or she turned in this kind of work. I want my money and my time back!"
4,End blows you away,"This was a great book. There are times when it is a little slow, but overall the book keeps you involved. Scott Brick is excellent as a reader. The end is powerful and very moving! Well worth the read!"
2,What a disappointment for a true Demille fan,"As a Nelson Demille devotee who has anxiously awaited a follow-up to ""Lion's Game,"" I was extremely dissapointed with ""Night Fall."" While Demille's style describing the inner workings of John Corey's mind remains superb, the story itself is unrealistic, unenthralling and predicatble. If this book were a movie, I'd have left halfway through."
4,Not DeMille at his best,It was an interesting book to read which brought many facts out about this terrible TWA tragedy. The Cory character was definetly not the same as he has been in the other books Demille had him in. It seems that he is much more low keyed in this book.It appears that DeMille had some trouble ending this book and how he did was very disappointing.Still the book was a good read.
5,Popular Thriller fiction doesn't get better than this,"Nelson DeMille really knocks it out of the park w/ this book. It is an extremely fascinating what if tale, that never gets boring, not even for a second. It is one of those rare books that will take over your life after a certain point. I read it for almost five hours straight finishing it"
3,Ending Disappoints,"I've read almost all of DeMille's novels and have very much enjoyed them, especially Gold Coast, Plum Island, and The Lion's Game.This book started off slowly and sort of died in the middle, but clearly had interesting possibilities as one moved forward.I was really looking for a terrific ending but was GREATLY disappointed. If I had know about the idea to the finale before-hand, I would never had read this book.While some may find the ending interesting at least, I though it was a cop-out on DeMille's part.Where is the sequel to the Lion's Game?"
3,Probably the worst ending in thriller history,"No, I'm not going to tip you off as to what it is. I really haven't the heart. But I will say this much: this the the lamest ending for a so-called thriller in the history of contemporary fiction. It is absolutely stunning in its sheer, laughable stupidity. Which is a crying shame since the set up is teriffic and the prose jumps.In the acknowledgments DeMille gives his twenty-something son full credit for dreaming up the ending when he couldn't think of anything, and on that basis he hypes the kid's own writing career. Frankly, in my view, if DeMille's son really did come up with this ending for 'Night Fall,' he'd be well advised to keep his day job."
3,Missing something,"I love John Corey and his sense of humor, but this book had a bunch of stuff that seemed to go nowhere. Sending our major characters out of the country was an interesting idea but was unexplored and therefore kinda useless. I was surprised by the lack of emotion in the last chapters, considering how the real life event is still so much an open wound for many of us, especially in the NYC area. I would definitely like to see more of John Corey, but this book was way too bureaucratic for my taste, I'd really like to see more action-adventure from this guy. Bruce Willis would definitely pass on this if it were a script! ;-)"
4,"Great read, but disappointing ending","This book was a five star - up until the last few pages. I loved John Corey, the main character, and there was even a few times where I laughed out loud at how witty he was.However, I was put off by how the book ended - like a lot of the other reviewers. Demille gets us excited and antsy, builds up an ending that we believe will end with a bang and then .... nothing.While I understand that since this book was based on true events, you can't change history - but at the same time, I hate being left with unanswered questions after I finish a book.Still worth the read though."
4,Thought Provoking,"This isn't my typical book, although I nevertheless enjoyed the heck out of it. At times the hero in the book exasperated and annoyed, and it did drag at times. All forgiven though because it's a darned good book. I had to go find out more about the incident and I really do wonder........."
4,John Corey at it again,"John Corey, now married to the lovely Ms. Mayfield, is at it again dealing with terrorism. It certainly makes you wonder about the TWA flight 800. DeMille uses his cantancerous dialog to make you laugh and grin and perhaps sometimes wish you had the ""hoodspa"" to say such things. Some twists about characters you thought were gone...reappear. Very entertaining!"
2,no end,I have to agree with the other reviewers. The story was provocative and the dialog interesting and entertaining. The worst end to a novel I can remember. With a decent ending at least four stars.
4,Cop-out,The book was engrossing throughout and piqued my interest into what really happened. I feel that the ending is a copout but I guess it is difficult to find a fictional ending for a true and controversial event that is still unanswered. With about 150 pages to go it was apparent that it was going to end the way it did but I enjoyed the story anyway.
5,A Full Nelson,"Though I have read a few books by Mr. Demille, this is the first John Corey book I have experienced. Mr. Demille shows his breadth as a writer in this book, having a wise-cracking, Myron Bolitar-like main character such as Corey.The time is July of 2001. John Corey's wife, a fellow F.B.I. agent, baits him into looking into the crash of TWA Flight 800, which was pronounced a victim of mechanical failure five years earlier by the investigating authorities.Corey learns of a couple that may have accidentally taped the event while filming themselves gettin' jiggy with it on the beach. Against the wishes of the of the F.B.I. and any other government agency, Corey digs into the incident, trying to locate the couple and subsequently the tape.The book picks up speed, ending the only way it can. Enjoy!"
4,John Corey is so much fun!,"Night Fall features John Corey. I discovered this character later in the series, so I'm catching up now on the earlier books. This is a great smart aleck character that is fun to read, but you couldn't stand in real life. No one should be that sure of himself! I will continue to read any John Corey stories that DeMille writes."
4,Good book with disappointing end.............,"I may not be a professional critic but I am an avid reader. This is one of the book that you cannot put off.John Corey is brilliant, with excellent sense of humour and courage. He portrays a true ex-NYPD cop and ATTF detective attitude with lots of guts and courage to find out the truth. Ofcourse, his wife Kate was the one to ignite this within him.A must read for some one who like dark humor, thrilling chases and ample use of grey cells.The only negative side of the book was the end. Its like, a surprise, oh! the book has completed."
3,"Good, but not his best....","Demille is awesome with his character development. the chitter chatter back and forth is just great...the scarcasm is typical demille. the story line was good and makes you think, but????"
4,Will the next book explain what happened?,It was a great read until the last chapter. Will we see Ted again? Will Bud and Jill survive? Dom didnt die on 9/11 after-all.This is either the absolute worse ending of all time or Ken is gong to retire and never write another book!The last chapter has sequal written on every line!Bad show Kenny!
3,Mistake ruined ending of otherwise good book,"Book would have ended better if the date given had been Sept 11 and not November...He confused the second Tuesday in November, election day, with September 11, 2001. I began thinking it possible that it was going to end the way it did until second tuesday, election day, was mentioned and I had to wait till the the error was obvious to see his mistake."
2,too predictable,"I agree with the reviewer who found this book to be a snooze. I really like some of DeMille's books, and was looking forward to this. I expected to read something inventive built around flight 800. Instead, he wrote the most obvious conspiracy theory. Not only does this lack the suspense of how it turns out, but the journey itself doesn't engage, as it does in some ""airline crash"" thrillers where the thrill is in the ""how"" it happened. For me, a big disappointment."
2,night fall,"I was under the impression that I ordered a hardback edition, but I received a paperback one instead. Al Dvoracek"
2,"""Night Fall"" by Nelson De Mille","If this were not written by Mr. De Mille, I would have never sloggedthrough it. The subject matter - an actual airline crash - nevergrabbed my interest. John Corey, the street smart wise cracker ofpast novels was not witty - just henpecked. The book never wentanywhere. I am disappointed."
3,"Everything that come up, must come down","This book started off slow, but picked up quickly. It was written in a very good way which I have came to expect from Demille. The book was a page turner and it kept you in suspense from the beginning to the end...almost. The big problem with the book was the ending, I won't say what happened because I don't want to ruin the book for anyone looking to reading Nightfall. But if your a person who get mad at a bad ending, you'll be furious with this book."
3,Enjoyable Quick Read -- Unfulfilling Ending,"Agree with other reviewers. The end is quite unfulfilling. I suppose it is true that the end written by Demille was the only plausiable one, given that this is fiction based on a historical event. Nevetheless, couldn't he have reached a bit more of a definitive conclusion? Perhaps the door is open for the next book to complete the story. I suspect not."
4,What Really Happened?,"Two lovers are out on the sand of the south shore of Long Island, filming their unfaithful indiscretions with passion and lust. They see a light arc upward into the sky and then a huge explosion that interrupts their love-making.This is a novel of TWA Flight 800 and how one investigator finds out what really happened to the Boeing 747 on that fateful summer night that took so many lives. He meets the lover and discovers the tape. With all the evidence he needs to prove it is a terrorist attack, he decides to reveal it to the world in downtown New York City.""Night Fall"" is a superb story of intrigue and drama in the finest tradition of a Frederick Forsythe novel where you are unsure where fiction leaves off and reality begins.Begin the reality of enjoying this novel."
3,Disappointing Finish,"I am a huge Nelson DeMille fan, and have read all of his books. This book as is well written as the rest, and had me hooked, staying up late to finish it. I am a sucker for smart mouthed heros - and DeMille always delivers, with Night Fall being no exception. However, it seems to me the author had a deadline to meet and didn't finish the book because of this. We are left with as many questions at the end of the book as we are at the beginning.So, if you enjoy DeMille's writing, this will be a good read for you. Just be prepared to say ""is that all there is?"" at the end of the book."
5,He just keeps getting better,"Read a library copy of the book first, then had to own this book. Nelson Demille never disappoints, he just keeps getting better. Just wish he would write faster. His next John Corey novel is being published in November, in time for my birthday, thank you, Nelson!"
2,Commercial pap for those ensconsed on the commode,"The dialogue was unbelievable. Will anyone notice, I wonder? Much preferred Sisters of Glass to this one. Compare and see what you think."
1,What was THAT all about?,"I read this novel while on vacation at the suggestion of my father-in-law. I have to say I'm not impressed. Maybe it's because this is my first DeMille novel, but I just didn't feel like the story ever grabbed me on any level. The last hundred pages actually FINALLY seemed to be going somewhere then BAM....nothing. Literally, nothing. I felt cheated after sticking with such a ho-hum story for so long that finally appeared to start going somewhere only to find out it was a dead end. Based on this novel I would never recommend a DeMille book to anyone. The ending has to be the worst ending of any book I've ever read, not to mention it's needlessly exploitive as well. That's 10 hours of my life I'll never get back and yes, I'm bitter. As I deeply respect my father-in-law's opinion, I'll probably read Lion's Game, but based on the ending of this one my expectations are not high."
2,Waste of your time,"Decent premise. Plays on nitwits conspiracy theories. If you are one of them (you know who you are), you'll like this book.Lots of useless filler dialogue. And the ending you could predict from page 3. Don't waste your life like I did hoping for some payoff at the end.Here, I'll save you time: All the ""evidence"" goes up (I guess down is more like it) in the Twin Towers on 911, so the conspiracy remains hidden by the CIA and FBI. Ironically, the FBI and CIA are supposed to be capable of creating this conspiracy to keep the public from learning the truth, but they are too stupid to prevent the attacks. Got to love the idiots who actually believe such patent nonsense to think anybody who is brain dead enough to work for the Gov't would have enough intelligence to actually think this stuff up.This book had promise, but the execution was miserable and the ending was a joke."
3,Not the best DeMille......,"I waited for years for this book and I was disappointed. I'm a huge DeMille fan and I've been very impatiently waiting for another John Corey novel.I was hoping DeMille would eventually tie up some lose ends from THE LION'S GAME and he didn't. Now I realize there probably won't be any conclusion to this novel either. The plot was engaging, well developed, thought-provoking, and suspenseful, but in the end I felt the story was anti-climatic.If you're already hooked on DeMille, as I am ~ you'll enjoy the novel. It's worth a read, DeMille is still my favorite author and I'd read this book 10 times before picking up a random novel.If you are new to the author, don't start here. Pick up THE GOLD COAST, PLUM ISLAND (the first John Corey novel), or THE CHARM SCHOOL."
3,"It's no Charm School, thats for sure.","What more can you say about the dreaded commercialization of a great author. You just get the feeling that writers like DeMille are pressured to churn out books in time for Christmas. Unfortunately, it's at the expense of quality writing. Compare this to his earliest offerings like The Charm School or Word of Honor and you will see what a compromise Night Fall really is. It will keep you interested and is certainly a decent read for the beach or a cross country flight. But truthfully, his new book pales in comparison to his early novels. I am not even sure why he wrote the book other than a paycheck."
3,Undecided on LI's East End,"The premise is a great one. After all, who doesn't want to know what REALLY happened to TWA 800? I think those that were disappointed in the ending were actually expecting that the book would tell them! Hello?!! It was a NOVEL!Anyway, I read the book with great interest, and actually didn't mind the ending. I did have trouble with some of the trite dialogue between the characters, and that sort of spoiled the book for me. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the passages, and so I wasn't truly able to ""escape"" into the book.In the end, Nightfall was not exactly my cuppa tea, but was worth the read because it raised some interesting questions."
2,Disappointing,"This is adequate thriller fiction, but the lame, limp ""ending"" is especially trite and disappointing."
2,Eh,"""Thriller"" based on the TWA #800 disaster off the coast of Long Island. You could wait for the mass-market version or you could skip it entirely. I recommend the latter."
2,98% AWESOME...2% makes it 2 stars!,"I have read every Nelson DeMille book as soon as it has come out ever since picking up Charm School (<-- UNBELIEVABLE book! 7 stars!) Night Fall really grabbed me early, as do most of DeMille's books. However, the end of the book is a complete cop-out. A MAJOR LET DOWN. I am surprised that he went for this ending. Too bad. Maybe next time he won't take the easy way out."
2,much ado about nothing,"I am an avid DeMille fan-I have read all his books. The last two, Up Country and Night Fall, are not up to his previous efforts. I was most disturbed by Night Fall because it lacked a sustained conflict. There is considerable repetition that doesn't move the plot forward. You can basically skip the whole section from around page 100 to 273 and not miss anything. I like the cynical John Corey. In the past he has been a much more dynamic character.The ending of the novel also seemed contrived and served to only frustrate me as it obliterated any chance of resolving the whole issue of Flight 800. Maybe Flight 800 can't be resolved, then why didn't he create a fictional flight?For my money Mayday, Spencerville, Cathedral and Lions Game are richer stories and keep you riveted. If you haven't tried DeMille yet, chose one of them. If you have read DeMille, you can only hope that he will pull out if his tailspin."
3,"Good story, but predictable","The book has terrific writing and great characters with an intriguing plot dealing with the TWA flight. However, while the story has a great pace and wonderful suspense, it becomes predictable half-way through the story. The reason for this is his timeline that HAS to FIT within historical events. How sad....I thought DeMille was going to give as an ""alternate history"" such as the likes of Harry Turtledove, but alas, it was not to be."
2,Cheated at the end,"This book is fun to read, and DeMille had me turning the pages all the way through, but I felt cheated at the end. It's hard to say more without giving too much away, but DeMille resorts to a fairly obvious bit of Deus Ex Machina that lets him off the hook (but leaves the reader hanging) in a big way. CHARM SCHOOL was much more satisfying. This book feels incomplete."
3,Anticipation turned to dissapointment,"I was surprised when I began reading ""Night Fall"". Since so much was published about flight 800 I could not see how this work of fiction would climax. The closer I came to the conclusion, the more dissapointed I became. Furthermore, John Cory is just not the same guy, now that he's married. This was not a good venue for Det. Cory. I was left with a feeling of being cheated at the end."
2,"Good Book, Disappointing Ending","Night Fall has a good plot, is well-written, and has a thoroughly abrupt, disappointing and unfulfilling ending."
2,"Lamest, limpest ending to a thriller","No spoilers here. I love John Corey, wisecracks and all. ""Plum Island"" is one of my all-time favorite books. John Corey + Kate Mayfield = the most improbable pair of Federal agents since Maxwell Smart and Agent 99. The fast-paced story unfolded and kept me riveted, even though it was set up at the beginning. But the ending -!! I read that DeMille didn't write the ending himself; his son did or helped him write it. Well, maybe that explains it but it's still no excuse for the lamest, limpest ending to a thriller I have ever read."
1,Lack of Ending Ruins A Good Story,I agree with the reviewers who were disappointed in the ending. I've never read a book in which the ending ruined the story so thoroughly. NOTHING was resolved! I felt thoroughly cheated.
2,Predictable,Very predictable. The ending is apparent after reading 1/3 of the book. A disappointment when compared with DeMille's other work
2,"Oh,Please...send us the real nelson de mille....","I have been a big fan of Mr.Demille for many years starting with ""By The Rivers of Babylon"". I was always thrilled when a new book came out. But,his last two efforts were really disappointing.Everyone else has told the story,so,i won't bore you. I just could not believe the storyline, how he took two incredible true stories and used them as a storyline. I really felt offended by this and I am NOT easily offended. It felt like a cheap shot,particularly the ending.I am saddened that this really good author felt he needed to use these two incidents to write a novel. I'm sure there is allot left in his brilliant mind.I hope that his next effort will prove this"
2,Highly disappointing - not worth the time,"I've read a number of DeMille's books & this was by far the worst.The story could have been told in about 200 pages, not the 496 DeMille wrote.The ending was terrible. The book just ended, without any real ending. If DeMille was committed to writing a long book, he should've written 600 pages and given us 104 pages of a real ending."
1,Unsatisfying ending.,"DeMille is a writer of great talent, yet I am unhappy with the delivery on this story. The ending is Deus Ex Machina. Nothing is in the slightest resolved. My time reading and searching for clues was a waste. I have seen this before in writers who think themselves too above their readers."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,What a colossal waste of time. I haven't been this disappointed since a James Patterson ending that was basically the same as this. And haven't picked up one of his books since. Now not so sure I will ever read another DeMille book or trust any reviews. Steer clear....
2,poor end - repetitive content,"Well, the concept was great, and parts of it were very interesting. The ending was a huge disappointment, and so much of the basic story was repeated a lot. Of course part of the problem could have been we listened to 15 hours of unabridged Cds which could have been cut to 6 hours without losing anything. I read the comment about why no better end, but since it was fiction - including the video that was the main plot element, why not a ficitonal end that was more satisfying? In any case I enjoyed Plum Island, and will likely read more of DeMille's books - just not on cd."
2,Worst Ending EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have read all of Nelson Demille's books and have enjoyed every single one thoroughly. Infact I started reading this book at 9am this morning, and honestly could not set it down for more than 5 minutes, before I HAD to pick it up and see what was going to happen next. Well the book was awesome all the way up until the last 5 pages. I have never, ever, ever seen a book end as bad as this. EVER. Even books that are not that good thoughout the whole thing, most of the time won't let you down like this at the end. I seriously threw the book in the garbage 5 seconds after reading the last paragraph.I have never in my life felt this let down by a book, it will definately be the last Demille book I read.If you have ever seen the movie Rudy, imagine watching that, then its the very last game, his family is there, waiting and watching, and all of a sudden they just stop the game for no reason and the movie ends."
3,"It's John Corey, but it may leave you wanting more","I'm a big fan of DeMille's John Corey character. However, it took one hundred pages for me to get interested; I started and stopped the novel three times. After page one hundred, I was very interested.There were a couple of scenes where I was surprised by Corey's reaction. This surprise has lingered with me. It seemed slightly out of character for him.And, there's the ending. I was caught off guard with how abruptly the story ended. But, unlike some the other reviews, I'm not convinced it's a bad thing. In fact, it may be ingenious, especially in the context of the series of books.Bottom line, if you like John Corey, you will like this book."
4,Worth Reading,"I enjoyed this book, the second in the John Corey series. It was really thought provoking about the crash of flight 800. Quick, suspenseful read. Raises more questions than it answers."
3,"Really like the John Corey character, but this was my least favorite because of the ending","I have read a few other DeMille John Corey books and I enjoy the characters and the funny dialog and commentary. This was a good read for the most part. And while all of his have endings that leave things hanging, this one takes the cake."
5,Night Fall,"I enjoyed this book thououghly. It was a very fast read for me and a big page-turner. I liked all of Nelson DeMille's books, but this one is my favorite."
3,"Good ending, but never really picked up steam...","Good, book, John Corey is up to his old tricks and will entertain the reader, but not enough to keep the book exciting. There are some aspects of the book that seem a bit fantastic. Nonetheless, it is a good read if you like Corey and his one liners..."
3,The ending is was a cop out,"This book was not bad. The story is very unique and the intrigue was there. A good mystery with a nice touch of humor. DeMille builds the suspense through the entire book and I was fascinated to reach the end. However, the end was hideous. It was a complete ""cop out"" of an ending. Almost an insulting ending. I feel like he could have done something a bit more thrilling to finish it. However the body of the book is fairly readable."
4,TWA Flight 800,"While a couple is video taping their illicit sexual encounter on a Long Island beach, the TWA flight 800 explodes in the background killing 200 passengers. Five years later, still unsolved but written off by the US government, John Cory's curiosity is peaked and he starts his own investigation.His wife Kate, career FBI and Cory seek to find the videotape and the truth to what happened that night five years ago. They find that the truth is more horrifying than the crash. You may not want to get on an airplane immediately after reading this book."
5,One of Demille's Best,"I have read all of the reviews of this particular book and cannot understand the overall lackluster reviews posted. I readily admit I am an avid fan of Demille and have now read all of the books Demille has written. Demille's main appeal to me has been his keen sense of wit expressed, together with suspenseful plot and interesting set of characters.Without a doubt, Demille's wit in this particular novel is the best to date. For those who liked Gold Coast and Gate House, Demille's wit in Night Fall will keep you laughing throughout your reading experience.The only Demille book I have found lacking in overall enjoyment was SPENCERVILLE."
4,Good Read. Entertains.,"John Corey has grown on me since Plum Island. I think Lion's Game was a smash it home run. Night Fall is not a 5 star book, however it is a very entertaing book. The pages turn easy and at the end of the day you will be glad you read Night Fall."
2,Disappointing and doubly exploitative,"Not nearly as good as, say, Plum Island, this book often feels like it is dragging and contains filler because the plot is rather simplistic and really not much actually happens. I also am not impressed with what I consider a rather revolting ending to what is already a book exploiting a national tragedy. In case you happen to read it, I won't reveal anything about the ending, but I do think it's an enormous cop-out and very unsatisfying."
3,typical DeMille,"just like Lion's Game - he must have run out of time. The ending was an insult. he had time to write relatively interesting book, only to disappoint in the end..."
3,Disapointment,A disappointing DeMille book is a rarity but I am afraid this one does not meet the standards of the author's other books. The only other book I felt this way about was The General's Daughter. The ending was a large disappointment. It seemed like he didn't know where to go with the ending and just ended the book.
1,Stink-O,"The only thing DeMille proves in this work is that he can use the word ""fart"" 4 times by page 140. This book is so repetitive that I kept thinking that I read it before - and I have - in every newspaper that covered the horrible crash of flight 800. This one should make it to the ""half price"" table real soon. It's certainly the last DeMille work I'll ever buy"
3,A decent read but not what I expected,"I've read every DeMille book,ever since I picked the Lions Game out of my aunties bookcase a few years back.I find him to be immensibly enjoyable in all his books,particularly the John Corey and Paul Brenner series.This book is a decent read, I may have even been a little harsh with only 3 stars,but what ruins the book for me is the return of a certain someone, or not his/her return,but the fact thats hes mentioned ALL the time leading up to his return.I honestly thought we would see someone else for a true twist like Fredric Tobin(who,admittedly, would have had nothing to do with the storyline) or Asad Khalil. I also do not understand Coreys hatred for him/her as at the end of the Lions Game,Corey tells how he could actually like him/her-why the sudden change of emotion?Apart from this,I found this book hugely enjoyable and a welcome addition to my DeMille collection.Well done Nelson DeMille"
1,Worst possible ending for what could have been a great book,"I have read everything DeMille has ever written. I anticipate each of his books and have for many years. I didn't read any reviews on Night Fall because I didn't want any spoilers (and I won't be giving any). BUT - the way he wraps up this book is a pitiful excuse for writing. The book itself is engaging and well-written, a typical DeMille great read. Until the end. You can see it coming and you just hope that he has a great twist waiting. But he doesn't. He cops out with basically no ending at all. What a total and complete letdown. No more money from me for Mr. DeMille because I would hate to be disappointed by him again. If you choose to buy this book - tear out the last 10 pages before you start - then make up any ending you want. Anything you can dream up will be better than what DeMille came up with."
3,Not his best,"I'm generally a big fan of DeMille, but I found this one disappointing. The idea of writing a thriller based on Flight 800 is very interesting, but I'm afraid that it forced DeMille to write himself into a corner. There is no way to resolve the mystery in a way that jibes with history, and (unlike Tom Clancy, for example) DeMille likes his characters to live in a world that is recognizably our own.As always, DeMille's dialog, characters and descriptions are first rate. On the other hand, the plot perks along nicely for several hundred pages and then comes to a screeching halt, with most of the mysteries unanswered. Very unsatisfying.I have no idea how much the facts of the case needed to be stretched to fit the plot. They seem interesting enough to me that a non-fiction review of the ins-and-outs of the evidence would likely have been a more entertaining read."
2,a shadow of his former books,"i have always eagerly waited for the release date of a demille novel and for the first time was dissappointed, it may have been a clue that he was running out of steam when he first started using recurring characters a few books back, but even on his worst day he was streets ahead of other writers in his genre, but it seems in his authors notes at the end he offers a backhanded apology for the ending and if he knew it was that bad why release it at all, i have read that nightfall may be his last novel, i would implore demille to write one more and go out with a bang instead of a whimper, i also would implore readers of nightfall that havent read his other books to read his others, notably THE GOLD COAST or CATHEDRAL before they judge his work, if mr demille reads these reviews i would like to say thank you for so many hours of great reading"
2,The means were not worth the end,"Nelson DeMille and his great character, John Corey, are fun to read but the ending to this book was so disappointing that I would not recommmend it. Mr. DeMille, you can do better! You should have just picked a version of the ""rocket theory"" and told that story, maybe in a parallel storyline way you did with Asad Khalil in the much better book, Lion's Game.I love John Corey's humor, wit, and sleuthing skills, but don't write another book with him unless you have a good end in mind!Thanks!"
4,A GOOD BUY ***,Nelson DeMille does a wonderful job of of meshing fact and fiction to make this a great read. His main characters are always people I'd like to know ... this one was no exception. The pace slowed down mid-way through but quickly picked up again and ended with a bang ... and a question! Enjoy.
1,night fall,"This book was so boring and drawn out. The first 300 pages were so repetitive that they could have been condensed to 75 pages....Hating not to finish any book I trudged on hoping.... but nothing. At page 400 I just couldn't waste anymore time with this book so I stopped and skipped to the last 50 pages. Sadly, I was able to pick up the story from there and then when I finally thought something was actually going to happen, Mr. DeMille used a national tragedy to end this horrible book leaving unanswered questions and dangling storylines...Having suffered lose in 9/11 I find his use of this event insensative and cheap. Mr. DeMille should be ashamed and it certainly does give hope to any amatuer writers because if he could get this published than anyone could."
3,"Worthy, But Not His Best","Nelson DeMille has for years been one of my favorite authors, gotta love that bad-boy Corey...but if this had been my first DeMille read I probably would not bother again. The ending is disappointing and flat, and seemed like a cop-out on unraveling the controversy. This novel just doesn't hold your interest as most of his work does, plus terrorism is not a plotline I find interesting. Something is missing here, and it could be due to the fact-based plot. I will continue to read DeMille. When he gets it right it's great."
4,Night Fall,"Great book, ending caught me by surprise. This is becasue it got so wrapped up in the story. Wonderful characters, I could identify with them and felt like I knew them personally. Great job."
1,Disappointed,"I usually enjoy DeMille's books but this was a true disappointment. I kept waiting for something to happen. He took the whole book for a story line that could have been done in a few chapters. I kept waiting for a terrorist to appear in the book but all we got were some on his old government ""friends"". I was looking for an explanation ( fictional) answer to TWA 800 and all we got was a a lot of questions and not very good one at that. I could see this book becoming a prequel to the next one where we find out who shoot the missile (if there actually was one). Best thing about this book was I go it from the library and didn'thave to pay for it."
1,Huh?,"I have just finished the book. Horrible ending, waste of time. I will never read another DeMille book. And I have enjoyed them in the past, even bought them as gifts for people. Awful."
1,Most Disappointing,"Wow ! I've read a lot of fiction. This book was a total waste of time. The book is about 650 pages (he could have pared it down to 300 w/o wasting any meaning whatsoever. After reading for an eternity, the plot was so disappointing I was annoyed at myself for wasting my time. I was waiting for resolution between the characters, for all to be revealed and justice done.... instead it felt like the author just gotlazy at the end and killed off everyone in one felt swoop. Shame on you."
2,Boring...the worst DeMille I've read yet,"I've read Plum Island, Charm School, and By the Rivers of Babylon all of which I thought were great. Night Fall, however, was a long dragged out boring read. It was very slow. I don't recommend this as a DeMille read."
5,NIGHT FALL,"i think that this book was absolutely fantastic. i read the entire book, cover to cover, in under 24 hours; i was that captivated. this book consumed me and i was not able to put it down. this author and this book brings to life our day and age of terrorism and after reading it, all i could do was sit, completely mesmorized and rethink what i had just read. this is the kind of book that makes you sit back and think when youre done, but yet you still want to keep reading. thats how good this book is. even with a great ending, you dont want this book to end but anyone with a clever mind and intellect will appreciate all the pages that their eyes have passed over."
1,Could Have Been A Great Book,"This could have been a great book if it weren't for the last chapter. I really enjoyed the story, even if it was fiction based on fact. However, it appears that Nelson became extremely bored or rushed as he was trying to finish the book. That or he suffered from writer's block. To blame the fact that we will never know the truth about TWA 800 on the horrible events that happened on 09/11 is disrespectful and disappointing. I will NEVER pick up another DeMille book again."
2,What ending?,"I'm so dissapointed that I wasted several hours of my life reading this book. Any reader with a hint of intellegence and logic will figure out where DeMille is going within the first hundred pages of this novel. The dialogue is witty and engrossing but it just isnt quite enough to make up for the miserable dissapointment of his ending and denouement. Or as my title suggests, what ending?"
5,Great product,"As we all know, you're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent SIDS. The SleepSack is a great product! It keeps baby nice and warm, yet you don't have to worry about a blanket. And there's space down in the bottom for his feet so he's not too restricted. Also, the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom, so you don't have a big zipper poking baby in the face."
5,this is a great device for stretching,I run 15 to 25 miles a week and play tennis two times a week. I often neglect to stretch and pay for it later.I have used ropes and other bands but really like the design of this one. The hand holds and foot holds make it easy to hold onto and as a result I will hold a stretch for a longer period of time. I have noticed a big difference in my flexibility. The instruction book is useful. I went through all the stretches and decided which I liked the most. It is a good reference when something feels tight. The Stretch-out -Strap and the foam roller are two of my favorite pre and post workout friends.
4,Helpful for physical therapy exercises,I am a physical therapist. We use this product in my clinic and I recommend it to patients all the time. I think it is a great investment.
5,very helpful,I had knee surgery and one of the best way to stretch is using this item which help to keep control of the movement.
5,Worth the money,It helps your stretching ability and enhances it making even the most unbearable stretches easy. A must have for people who struggle
5,Easy to grab onto!,I'm getting the best stretches I've ever had! I just put my foot into one loop and my hand into the other loop ... it's that simple. And what's best is that I don't have to grip the strap ... so it saves my forearm from getting tired. I toast to whoever invented this simple but innovative contraption!
4,Excellent Product,"I use an item similar to this in personal training sessions at my local health club. I wanted to buy a similar device to use at home following aerobic workouts. This device is essentially identical to the one the trainers use at the health club and works just as it should. I am very happy with its performance. Here are some specifics:Pros* Sturdy construction.* Strong, heavily stitched loop joints.* Multiple loops for various applications.* Helpful and informative instruction manual.Cons* End loops could be a little bigger to accommodate larger foot/shoe sizes.Comments* This product does what it is supposed to do.* The only recommendation I have for improvement would be larger end loops.* Overall, this is an excellent product (four-star) product. I strongly recommend it."
5,Great product,"Words can nort describe how much this strap will help you stretch. I have been using it at the chiropractor to help stretch out my hamstrings. Now I can stretch at home during my spare time, as it was suggested that I stretch at least once per day. It is made of durable material and the book contains illustrations of all of the various exercises you can perform. Great product, great price!"
5,Love it so much I bought two,"I have been having back and leg muscle problems for too many years of sitting for work and for fun (stupid video games). As a result I have to spend a lot of time stretching -- this strap is great. Very durable. Love the loops. I travel for work and bought a second to leave at my hotel. I can't comment on the contents of the book, as I have never even opened it."
5,Stretch-out strap,"I'm a retired Physical Therapist and used to use thistype of strap with my clients. The instruction bookhas been updated and is well done, especially if someoneis not familiar with this strap. The seller was veryprompt with shipping!"
3,not what i wanted,this was returned because i thought it would stretch and it doesn't. the name on this is misleading. you would have to want to follow their book to use this.
5,"Sturdy, well made",My PT recommended this product to me as part of knee rehab. I now use it for daily leg stretching. It's solid and can withstand a lot of stress.
5,very good product and good price,Good product and cheap compared to prices in shops. Very helpful for physio therapy exercises. I wished I had the time to use it more often.
5,Great product.,"SIMPLE, EFFECTIVE,EFFICIENT. I'm 67 and am purchasing more for wife and mother. I travel weekly & like its potability. Use if for flexibility, but also for strength."
5,Not just a belt,"I have an old Karate belt and I use, but this is different. What's different? The way you stretch with this is completely different. First you PULL your muscles. So if you're stretching your hamstrings, you pull your foot towards you hips - without stretching, just compressing. Then you release the pull and now gently pull into a tiny stretch and hold. Now pull down again from your new stretch position - now release and stretch a little more. Repeat. Stretching is no longer painful. You've protected the muscle by contracting it and when you release, it moves a little more without any pressure.It's a whole new and better way to stretch. As always, never stretch to pain."
4,Excellent tool,"If only someone would make ,me use it. Used one in physical therapy, so know the benefits, so just need to remember to use it.."
4,Good,"Is as described and does everything its supposed to do. While the strap does feel solid and strong, it does not seem quite as sturdy as the one I used at physical therapy. I am 6'4"" and the length is fine without having to get the xl sized strap so that is a plus."
4,Now that's how a stretch should feel!!,"After a recent back injury I needed something to help optimize my stretching routine, that's where the Stretch-Out Strap came into play. I used a towel and other ""home remedies"" to help with my stretches, but never felt I was getting what I needed. Self stretching is made so much easier with this device, and it comes with an easy to follow 40 page booklet. It's like having a personal trainer do manual stretches for my legs and back. As for the price, I paid under $20 (shipping incl.), what a steal! I would highly recommend this item for maintaining your flexibility and ROM(Range of Motion), especially after an injury (providing your doctors OK), or for all people who are athletic or enjoy Yoga and Pilates. Don't worry about this strap falling apart, it's made a highly durable Nylon...which will probably last a 1000 years. If it gets dirty, just throw it in the wash. What rating would I give this, hands down an A++++, you'll be totally satisfied."
5,Same as my PT uses,"This was the same strap my PT uses. I had purchased a blue foam roller online, and it deformed within two months. My PT says to buy a black one."
2,Confused,"I'm not sure how this product is any different from using a towel, and I don't like it nearly as much as a theraband which provides flexible resistance and can be made to do many exercises very easily."
5,Great Strap for Home Physical Therapy,"I have been going to Physical Therapy after knee surgery, and this is the strap that they use there. When I asked them where to get one, they said to just buy a dog leash. I copied the name and company down and went online and found it at Amazon.com. At the price I paid, the dog's leash would be more expensive, and not have all the hand hold loops that this comes with. It also came with a booklet on excercises so my husband is now using it also. It is strong, and I figure that if they use it at Physical Therapy, it really gets a lot of use, so should last me forever."
5,Highly recommended!! We love it!,Got this for my husband to stretch his back. He's not very flexible and he absolutely LOVES this. You have to have this for therapeutic stretching or just for yoga poses. This is a must have. He kept reminding me to leave a good review he loves it so much.
3,"Works well, but not really necessary","It's a nice simple stretching tool, but I realized after a few uses that I could do most of the exercises as well or better without it. The booklet that comes with it is a nice overall stretching guide and has some good tips on stretching. I'd say that's actually the most valuable part. However, a lot of the exercises I found I could do just as well with my hands or with a wall. Like for the hamstrings, I found lying next to a corner wall and putting my leg up against it was a far better hamstring stretch than pulling on it with the strap. And for the quads, just reaching and pulling them with my hands was easy. I guess if you can't reach your foot at all then this would be useful. Considering most books on stretching will be about the same price as this strap and book it's still a pretty good deal if you are unflexible and just getting started."
5,Excellent product,"I have recently been given new stretching exercises as part of a physical therapy routine, and I was looking for a strap that would be similar to the one at the therapist. This strap appears identical to the one used by my therapist organization. It is sturdy, with the loops sewn in very well so one feels very confident applying any amount of force between any two loops during a stretch without any worry. Works much better than anything else I have seen as a stretching assist."
5,"Rapid Service, Great Buy","I had back surgery and been using this same strap and most of the exercises in this book. I had gone shopping for this same strap but to no avail. You know Houston, Tx is a large city. I thought of Amazon.com and found what I was hunting for the first time. I also found the Lux timer clock I was needing and ordered it on a separate order.I used the Memorial Hermann NW Hospital for physical therapy and they posted my order sheet on their open board so other patients can order one from you.Thank you Amazon.comJ.H. Houston"
3,No Dvd,Good product durable and convenient. would be more helpful if a dvd was included would be more encouraging in using regularly.
5,Stretch-out strap is a great product,I purchased this product for rehab after knee surgery. It's a great product! Sturdy and has loops so you can easy pull for exercises.
5,A Great Aid to Stretching exercise,"I first learned about this strap from a physical therapist. This an excellent, inexpensive item that anyone who exercises and stretches their muscles should have. The multiple loops provide hand and leg holes for comfortable stretching."
5,My new stretching partner!!,"I remember doing resistance stretching back in my school days on the track team and it was so beneficial. However, in my adult years when I have done most of my workouts solo, the 'partner stretching' became non-existent. Until NOW - this strap is your Partner (and it doesn't complain and will work out when you want to!).The strap is very sturdy and will hold your stretches well. I find doing some of the stretches work better in bare feet - sometimes it will be slippery on socks. The instructional booklet is great - it gives a variety for each muscle group and shows pictures in step-by-step form."
5,"Absolutely works, great product","The straps works!!!! Great streching. I purchased the strap to help me with my ballet moves, arabesque and splits. Have already improved my splits! I highly recommend it. Very easy to use! Just love it"
4,Where is the box?,"For anyone who likes to discover American classical music this CD is a good one. It's conducter has been a most important figure in modern American musical tradition, one to be really very proud of. This CD show some of his masterful performances and compositions. The recording of this CD is well done by Deutsche Grammophon. There is only one thing I do regret: both CD's are packed in a booklet that looks nice, but is very unpractical. Be careful not to damage the CD's by taking them out! Or prevent them falling out and down to the floor. I simply miss a proper box with a booklet and some pictures of the legendary Bernstein in action within. It is really a pity that the Universal Music Group choose for this rather cheap looking booklet. Bernstein deserved much better! So I advise you to buy an additional proper CD-box yourself, for storing these beautiful CD's clean and safe. I give five stars for the CD's minus one star for the cheap way they are presented."
1,"Shallow, impressionist, the Orientalists view of the Modern Greece","Gallant relies excessively on 19th century British views of Greece -- and it shows. The perspective is patronizing and the result is a a rather shallow caricature. Really the book is, unwittingly, a reflection of its limited sources' worldview more than anything illuminating on Greece.A much better, and more respected, work is Clogg's ""Short History of Modern Greece."""
4,More of a novel than a mystery,"I own every book Robert Barnard has written, so I am a big fan. What I find interesting in his books is that you can always guess what he's been reading recently. For instance, this book reminds me of Atonement by Ian McEwen, in being about an elderly writer looking back on her adolescence, which includes a climactic rape. There is also the possibility that she, as a writer, has edited her version of the past as a protection for someone or atonement for something.That said, this is not your standard Barnard mystery, with deliciously nasty characters and a real puzzler that only resolves in the last few lines. It's more of a character study--interesting, but not a page turner."
5,Simply superb,"I've been working on a parallel renderer in my spare time for a bit and without a doubt - this book is a definate keeper in my library. A solid introduction, as well as providing more intermediate material- this book also provides a ray tracing system that is immediately extensible for your own experiments.This book has enough material and ideas to keep a ray tracing programmer busy for years."
2,Not Deluxe,"Stronghold 2 was my favorite of the series, exited about the deluxe version. It updates to Stronghold 2 - 1.4. The same update and the same play as the original. Also no game manual."
4,Excellent game,I was used to the original Stronghold so naturally the graphics are so much better!! More of a challenge also.
4,what a great cd,"I had the pleasure of seeing King Prawn play live with Goldfinger in london right before I bought this cd. I must admit King Prawn sounds much better live than on their cd, but it is still one of my favorite albums. Kinga Prawn started up in 1995 and since then have become one of londons leading bands. They have some great songs, playing in a unique punk/ska style. They have a great combination of guitar, bass, and drums, with the occasional incorporation of a horn. If your a punk fan I strongly suggest you buy this cd."
4,"Pretty decent, but cheaper at walmart.","I bought this airbed a couple of days ago simply because I needed something to sleep on and it's a swissgear product. So far, the bed's been fantastic. it's firm and comfortable, and like any airbed, you need to refill every couple of days.The crappy about this product is that a few days after i got it, i saw the same thing in walmart for 20 bucks cheaper than what i spent on it.Other than that, I'm very happy with my airbed."
2,Problems with the Valve,"I bought this for our camping trip to the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee. The valve on this matress has a little flap on the inside that is supposed to stop air from coming out while you're securing the screw-on valve. Unfortunatly, the design of the pump is such that you have a plastic nozzle that pushes the flap back to far to shut properly.What this means is that you pump it up nice and firm, but the flap does not properly prevent air from escaping while you secure the valve cover. So you end up with not nearly as firm a matress as you would otherwise have.I will say that the mattress did stay at the the less than firm inflation point while we slept on it overnight, and the pump was robust and quick. However, the valve flap problem is serious enough that I am returning the product."
2,popped,i cant fit a normal mattress in my new apt so i need this till i move i had it a month and the one of the seams tore and kept getting bigger i couldnt patch it because the hole was on the velour side so i had to buy a new one. im not buyin a swiss air mattress again
2,"Not the ""traditional"" pumpkin pie spice",This product is like cinnamon sugar - pumpkin pie spice + a bunch of sugar. The product name should be changed to make this not as misleading.
1,bottle of sugar,"Ingredients: Sugar, Maltodextrin, Sucralose, SpicesI was so disappointed in this product! This isn't a pumpkin pie spice mix, it's a bottle of sweeteners with a couple of ""spices"" thrown in. It smells good but its aroma masks the fact that it tastes like, looks like, and is essentially SUGAR."
1,Don't Buy This Bracket,"The people who sold this item are great, it arrived quickly and was packaged very well. I couldn't ask for better customer service. The bracket itself is an unbelievable pile of junk. I didn't think so many things could be dysfunctional with such a small and simple bracket. All the other reviews are correct, the mounting nut is too high, the bracket won't fit over the lip of the hitch receiver tube. The nut was soldered into place misaligned so the bolt just threads into the side of the bracket and wouldn't lock anything into place even if I could get it over the receiver tube lip. It's such an inexpensive item, it's not worth returning for a replacement or refund (not that a replacement would do any good). I don't have the time to stand in line for 50 minutes at the post office or the UPS store over a $20 part and I don't have time to figure out who to e-mail about the problem. Lesson learned, go another direction."
2,Don't waste your money.,"Virtually useless device. Minimally needs bolt w/locking nut on side of bracket as well as the top to restrict movement laterally as well as vertically. As designed it just wobbles around and scratches the top of the receiver... Simple, thin shims work better!"
3,Not bad should be better,The unit works OK-- but it has to be re-worked because it doesn't fit all models of truck. Especially the Dodge 2002 4 DR Quad Cab 1500 PU W/ painted bumpers. Had to turn it on its side & regrind the attached nut that's welded to it and then it works OK.
1,Poorly made...,"I thought this was going to be so cute, but it really was a waste of money. It was poorly made and did not fit well. Don't buy it."
3,None of the reviews listed are for the Miami-Mobile Chartbook,"WRONG BOOK These Are for the east coast ICW chartbook NOT""The Intracoastal Waterway Chartbook: Miami, Florida to Mobile, Alabama"""
3,Smaller,This book is a little compact making the charts smaller than other similiar chart books. It's a good reference to use in conjunction with GPS navigation and small enough to keep in the cockpit. It would be nice if it showed the locations of Marinas to keep you from switching from book to book. All of these charts can be accessed on line for free.
3,TheOldFox,Author introduces some very interesting concepts. A little too much time spent on cross reference analysis. Definitely worth the read.
3,An Interesting Dip Into Unknown Waters,"This book, edited by Kasser, Meyer and Wurst, seemed fairly repetitive, given the limited amount of material they had to work with; however, it does add to our knowledge of early Christianity. Whether it holds up to scholarly scrutiny however, remains to be seen......"
4,Hmmmmm....,"I will give this 4 stars since it was very well written; however, I still feel it is missing a piece of the puzzle. How could there have been time for Judas to have developed a following in order for someone to have written ""the gospel of Judas"", when he killed himself shortly after betraying Jesus? He certainly didn't write it, as it was written after he died. I'm a big fan of the Gnostic Gospels, but this one doesn't make sense. Again, very well researched and written, but..."
2,Religious,"After reading this book and knowing what I know from many gospels, Ifind this book very hard to believe. It just is far to away from allthe other gospels out there. I have read the ""Other Bible"" and manyof the gospels not found in the Bible of today, but none talk like thegospel of Judas. I do not know who actually wrote this book, but Iwould not put a whole lot of faith in it as truth. Why would Jesuswant to be crucifed in order to go back to the spirit world. I canthink of a lot of ways to kill yourself that are less painful. Tothink Jesus wanted Judas to turn him in, so that he could be killed,so he could go back to heaven, is just plain stupid. Jesus couldhave just drank poison to do that. No one would ask for such apainful death as crucifixion."
3,a decent read,"This book is more textual information than real discussion about Judas as a person who is supposedly working with Jesus to fulfill the Scriptures. However, it is an interesting thesis and is also interesting to see how he sees Judas becoming demonized with the passage of time.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Interesting look at a significant historical project.,"I found the first part of this volume, the translation of the gospel of Judas itself, particularly interesting. I think that this is a necessary read for those who want to speak intelligently about what the media is reporting on frequently these days as well as a requirement for anyone curious about modern gnostic scholarship."
3,The Gospel of Judas,"Informative, but not what I expected from all the hoopla. The entire text of the Gospel was very short due to fragmentation. The book mostly dealt with how it was found and the history of the found Gospel, not the contents of the Gospel, since there was so little contained in the recovered Gospel. It does however give you a deep appreciation of just what is involved in trying to get anything of worth from the Archeological finds in Egypt."
3,Does it's job well...,"The Gospel of Judasedited by Kasser, Meyer, and Wurstcommentary by Bart D EhrmanThe book ""Gospel of Judas"" does it's job well. That is, translating and presenting the discovery and texts of the ancient Gospel of Judas.However, this book is more like a bloated encyclopedia entry than an engaging documentary.I enjoyed this read, but would only recommend it to those who crave religious history. By last count, they didn't number very high."
5,Very Satisfied,I appreciated the speed in which we got the book and enjoyed reading it. The book was in great shape. Thank you
5,Early Christianity,"This gives a more detailed commentary on the Judas Gospel than is possible in a TV show or magazine article, and of course the footnotes lead one on to a more detailed study!"
2,mostly gnostic fantasy,"Dispite all the hype, the small volume is yet another of those third or fourth century ""mystic"" manuals of the so-called secret teachings of Jesus, who says we all have our own star, and instead of the ethical sayings of Jesus, the focus in on who does the god really like. Speculation as to what Judas thought and when he thought it seems to be the only new thing in this. Its a speculation one can find in the real Gospels and traces in such modern works as Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. There really is not much new or useful in this. Sure, the Apostles didm't understand Jesus. But the claim that Judas did is undone by all mystic claptrap in the rest of this thin volume. If you are looking for another Gospel, try Thomas' - at least in it there is some things to think about."
1,I doubt it is true,My thoughts are did Judas have the time and clarity of mind to write this account or tell someone the account so they can write it in the rapid timespan of events prior to his suicide? I don't think so.This is mysterious writing. It may be interesting to some but the fact is that it was dated 250 years after Christ died. The four Gospels were written less than 50 years after Christ died.Make up your own mind but keep these facts in the back of your mind.
2,Two stars only,"One star for Lennon - McCartney cover, second one for Jimmy Page guitar. Unfortunatelly, didn't have a chance to listen to original version (this one is remastered version)."
5,Love it!,"I couldn't be happier with this float. It's perfect, and was shipped to me immediately after I ordered it. It should last for years, like the last one I had just like it."
3,Just OK,"This float is just ok. I've used it only a few times, and it has a tear in the seam. Also, it is not great if you don't want to get your hair wet."
4,does the job,"air ths baby out for a few days! whew-we did it smell like butt when i took it out of box. strange smell. but, its great other than that. and the price was decent compared to others"
1,Would not buy again,These floats are much thiner than competitive products and do not support much weight.The finish is also bad and the surface will stick together when it comes in contact with itself.
3,Looks great but not that great.,"This float looks great in the pictures, but it isn't that great. It is not too thick, so it doesn't work that great as a float. Maybe if you are a very thin or small person it works OK, but for normal people this is not that comfy to float on in the pool. =( Our mini schnauzers like it for floating in the pool or laying on the pool deck though. I think the kids will get more use out of this than the adults."
1,Too thin to stay on top of water,"I watched as my 100 pound daughter got on this float and went down into the water in a sitting position up to her neck. When she laid down, the water was still covering her. Disappointed."
2,thin and light weight,Float is designed for smaller individuals. Is only recommended for weights up to 150 lbs. If you're over that this float will not keep muck of your body out of the water.
4,"Nice Float, Saw Them in Mexico","I don't own a pool but I first experienced these floats when I went on vacation in Cancun, Mexico. The resort I stayed at had about 50 or so of these floats. From what I can tell, these floats are very durable and stay afloat extremely well, no matter what the size of the person.My fiance's father commented on one of these a few months ago and I decided to get him one for his birthday because he does have a pool at his home. He's owned it for about 4 months now and it still looks as good as the day I bought it.One of the great aspects about the float is that there is no inflation required. So you don't have to deal with any huge bulk and it's easy to store (just roll it up). It's made of some kind of foam that stays afloat, so that's how it works.Highly recommended!"
1,Float won't float!,This pool float doesn't float! I weigh 121 lbs. The float doesn't keep my body above water. On my stomach my face is below water level. It won't even hold my 5 year old above water. Complete waste of money. Will attempt to return. If I can't it will be almost a hundred bucks into the dumpster and solid waste stream. :(
4,Perfect Floaty!,"I used this all through the summer and it is great! Perfect for pool or lake day relaxation. Great product, good price, shipped in two days with my Prime account."
5,Hifana,"Hifana makes great japanese electronica, and their live shows are awesome. I had the pleasure of meeting them in Tokyo, and they're really nice too. The videos on the DVDs are simply amazing. If you like Hifana, you'll probably like Afra (beatbox) and Gagle (hip-hop)."
4,Worth the space on your bookshelf.,"A practical little book, although it would help if you have a few years of high school Latin to speed up the process of using the phrases in the best possible context. If you have to write a lot of presentations or topical articles, this book is great value."
5,Latin Quotations,"The book is an exact answer to my requirements.Having done some Latin at school (many many years ago) I am familiar with a number of Latin quotations. There are obviously many I don't know and his book serves the double purpose of broadening my knowledge and at the same time making sure I avoid ""malapropisms""."
4,Cool,"My latin teacher gives us expressions to memorize, and I realized that he gets all of them from this book! It helped me get ahead in class :)"
5,Hic liber amo multus!,"This is an excellent book! It is a great way to build vocabulary and learn those pesky endings. It also conatins many words of wisdom and wit. Using these phrases in writitng and speech will give you a flair of sophistication. This book taught me my favourite quote, from Horace ""Dulce et decorem est pro patria mori"" ""There is no greater honour than to die for ones country"" Being a die-hard Americo-Unian, I believe that! I reccomend this book to all lovers of Latin"
2,Wimpy Mozart Will Never Do,"Given the cast of characters, this should be much, much better than it is. But Abbado seems intent on keeping everything buttoned down lest anything exciting happen in this traversal of Mozart's valedictory work. It all sounds anemic; chorally,orchestrally, and interpretively. You would have no idea the work is about death and it's associated dramatics from listening to this cluelessly uneventful read-through. I feel bad for Terfel who seems to be the one participant who knows a turkey is being hatched and does his best to stop it. Alas, even his best efforts aren't enough. (He royally mixes up his words at one point in the ""Recordare"", though by then it's too late to care.) With Barenboim's first account for EMI (Armstrong, Baker, Gedda,Fischer-Dieskau), Colin Davis on Philips Duo, and Marriner's second recording of the work (also on Philips) all still available, this is utterly superfluous and easily avoided."
2,DECEPCIONANTE!,"El CD aparentemente es ideal, Mozart Réquiem en memoria de Herbert Von Karajan, grabado en vivo desde la Catedral de Salzburgo, Pero la realidad es otra, la interpretación de Claudio Abbado, es floja, inexpresiva, hasta medio ligera, este es un disco para obviar."
4,great product,I love these reeds. I bought them for my husband back in July for his birthday. The quality of the reeds are great. They produce a great sound. They are study and do not break easily. The shipping time was great and they came right on time. Great product!
4,great synopsis and information,I recently reviewed this book and am very impressed with how much the author has included in a very succinct way. I especially appreciated her section on card company profiles which illustrates a variety of styles desired by different companies. To know about and request card company profiles is a significant help. I also felt that her step-by -step approach is most useful and easy to understand.. I would find this book an excellent resource as well as a great tecnique book.
2,Not much here,"The book is slim to start with, and page after page is devoted to reproductions of cards -- something anyone can see by visiting the nearest drug store.Information about contacting greeting card companies is so scant as to be almost useless. For example, only a quick mention of query letters.The section on self publishing is 4 partial pages long, with yet more samples of art work.The book is so padded with fluff and white space that it's [not good]. I read it cover to cover in 40 minutes, and that included looking at the dozens of pictures."
1,One of the weakest Holiday movies ever made,"The actor who plays Santa Claus is wonderful, but even he can't save this horrible script. The story line is so bad and full of obvious holes that even my children won't watch it. Good thing we streamed it on NetFlix and didn't waste the money to buy it."
1,Ho Ho Horrible,"I saw this when it came out and I hated it. What drivel. SPOILERS AHEAD. Atrocious dialogue ""I'm pitching a no-hitter for the Yankees"", dumb story, and an even dumber Santa. You mean to tell me after all those centuries, Santa never realized there were poor kids in the world?? And I suppose there's only one child in all of NYC that's homeless??? I love most Christmas specials but this a dud. You'd be much better off watching Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, that was much more realistic."
1,DREADFUL,"I love the other films by the director of SANTA CLAUS so I thought I should buy it. Well, it is the only film I've ever regretted purchasing as I could not even watch it through without fast forwarding cuz it is so awful. It is wholly without irony in its subject and its so relentlessly optomistic that it becomes oppressive. Who wants to watch looooonnnnnnng sequences of elves making crafty looking toys that no child would want to play with while the most insipid music ever scored drives you to suicide in the background. This is like a remake of a George Pal puppetoon stretched to over two hours and coated with enough sugar to make the entire world diabetic in just one sitting. I haaaaatttttteddddd this film and I hope that I never have to see any portion or still of it again. BLEEECHHH!!!!"
4,This is a memorable Christmas story.,"I watched this movie with my children when it first came out at the theater and have never forgotten it. Not only was Dudley Moore perfect in his portrayal, the story line is a classic!"
5,Top film!,"The most essential part of my families christmas plans, barring presents and food, is to sit down and watch this film. The film itself contains so many unusual elements which inspire the ""christmas feeling"" throughout my family. It really is a magical film."
5,This is the best Christmas movie you will ever see!,"This is the best Christmas movie you will ever see. Except of course, for ""A Christmas Story"". Dudley Moore puts up one of his best performances since ""Arthur."""
4,Santa Claus the movie,"I like the theme,scenery, and actors! I play this movie every year at the Christmas season as it has an interesting story of how Santa Claus was originated to bring joy to all the children of the world!!"
2,Review for the blu-ray,"I read many of the reviews and they were all for the dvd version of the movie. I ordered the blu ray version and it did not work on my blu ray player. I returned the movie thinking that maybe something was wrong with the disc and when I received the replacement it still did not work. I had my husband look at it and I guess it was something about the region of the disc where it only plays in certain countries. I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and I was so excited to find that it was on blu ray. Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it on blu ray so I opted for the dvd version. Loved the movie, but wish I could have experienced it on blu ray."
5,nostalgic movie,I remember this movie from when my children were small. It was one of our favorites. Now I am showing it to my grandchildren. We all love it.
4,"I AGREE, GIVE IT A CHANCE!","People love to dump all over this movie, but it's a visually stunning 80's classic. Maybe some people forget a good dose of cheese was required for most 80's films, and this one is no exception. Give it a try, it'sa fun view, and looks stunning on blu ray!"
4,Okay. Good movie for kids.,"I had only remembered that awesome intro to the movie from when it came out. Forgot that it was a comedy-like movie. Good for young people and the child in those with a good ""funny bone"" in their body. I am not such a one, I would prefer an old type serious traditional story from the Old World tales of St. Nick and good deeds, and such. But, again if you like comedy....and a modern these, this is a great movie for you."
4,memories,Santa Claus was first movie my daughter saw in a theatre so this was a true nostalgia kick and something she can share with her first child.
4,Great movie!,We all truly enjoyed this movie! The picture quality was just ok. It is a nice Christmas movie and I will watch it every year.
3,An Entertaining Holiday Movie!,"While this is far from the best holiday movie, and definitely not Dudley Moore's best performance, it's still an entertaining family movie. If you like John Lithgow (Dexter, 3rd Rock, etc.) you'll love this movie. He does a great job at being the villain. It's campy but fun!"
5,Replaced a favorite,I appreciated the swift service and the excellent quality of the DVD. This is my favorite Christmas movie and seem to have lost my original. Thanks again.
4,Childhood Memories,"This product was great! I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. The shipping was quick and efficient, no problems!"
1,"Please God, Make it Stop","In the history of bad movies, this one sets new standards. In the middle of the movie I remember thinking, ""Please God, Make it Stop."" The actor who plays Joe evokes a visceral response in the viewer bordering on homicidal rage. Better casting could have been done by simply picking random people in Central Park. The only redeeming acting is done by John Lithgow who is so evil on screen, that he is actually endearing. There should have been more of him and less of everyone else. I did survive this movie, but it has left an indelible scar on my soul. Please God, end my agony -- stop the movie or just kill me."
2,"A Christmas turkey, if you will excuse the pun.","If you are a conneuisseur of bad movies, then this one's for you. Dudley Moore, a fine Brit actor, is totally wasted(must have been the money) as an elf who leaves Santa's workshop and gets sucked in by an evil, corrupt toymaker BZ(played by John Lithgow of THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN fame!) who wants to commercialise Christmas for his own ends. Well, this bit sounds familiar, note the media tycoons who hype parents into beating each other up over the hottest toys(Ho-ho-ho)(Oh dear, groan, bad joke). One could say that was one of the movie's merits, being ahead of its time! I give it two stars also because it is a very colourful film for young children who don't have half a brain to realise that Tim Allen's recent THE SANTA CLAUSE is far more enjoyable and answers more questions about kid's interests in Santa Claus at that time of the year . . . Never mind. And I thought MYSTERY MEN sucked . . ."
5,One of my Favorite Christmas Films,"I have watched this movie every Christmas since I can remember! I still love seeing Santa's magic workshop, and the Reindeer who is afraid of heights and cover's his eyes with his ears :) If you are an 80's child this is a must have."
5,Favourite Christmas New-Classic!,"I have been watching this film on Beta video since I was a little girl. Now that I am married, my husband and I were just talking about how much we love this movie and how we would love to have it for the Christmas season this year. I was shocked to find that the movie was re-released, on DVD, no less, and widescreen, which is what my husband and I prefer. I purchased the above movie a few days ago and cannot wait to watch it with my husband and have as a keepsake for years to come!!Thanks for re-releasing such a ""warm fuzzy-ing"" movie!!"
5,great service and loved the movie and excellent price!,I ordered this movie two days before christmas and got it in time!it arrived way early and in new condition.
3,Didnt know it could be only in english,"I ordered from Venezuela, is the first mpovie i have that doesnt come with the option in spanish, so my nephews cant understand, i was very dissapointed, i didnt check the details, i just assume it will have spanish audio"
3,Dudley Moore = cheesy movie,"The beginning is a wonderful story about the origin of Santa Claus. The middle and end get pretty cheesy, but still not a bad movie to watch around the holidays."
5,Santa claus the movie,The family have had this movie on video tape for about 16yrs andalways watch it at Christmas.This movie has something about it that all other Christmas moviesseem to lack.It has never received any accolades from the critics but who cares.
2,Loses all its charm half way through,"The first half of the movie is charming enough, and great eye candy -- a real showcase for the set decorators, costume designers and prop makers. But by the time Santa reaches the 20th century, all the charm is lost. The movie doesn't seem to go anywhere, and Lithgow is just WAY over the top. Too many segmented plotlines clutter up the story, although the film does have one of the greatest Santa and Mrs. Claus combos I've ever seen!Also, although it says it is close captioned, it is not subtitled, so most people won't be able to get ""the words"" if they have a high-def or blu-ray player."
1,Terrible!,"Nowhere in the description did it tell me what ""region 2"" was...FYI it means the DVD can only be played in the Middle East!!! Thanks for wasting my money!"
5,One of the best Christmas movies,This is one of my all time favorites! Now I get to share it with my little boy!
5,Santa Claus The Movie,Anyone who loves the magic in Christmas will love Santa Claus the movie. My tape is so wore out from constant use by my kids and their cousins that I need another copy. Anyone who gives this movie a bad review has obviously lost touch with their inner child. They should be called a grinch . Obviously their hearts need to grow a lot bigger.
5,Yes Virginia-there is a Santa Claus,"This movie is in many ways the ideal Christmas movie. The worldwide fascination with Santa Claus is timeless, and it's nice to have a movie that actually focuses on him, as opposed to his being a mere backdrop(the only other movie to accomplish this feat being the wonderful Miracle on 34th Street).This movie does have its very vocal detractors, and to them all I can say is Bah Humbug. This movie has it all-a great cast, beautiful cinematography, great music and phenomenal sets. Whether you're 3 or 93 if you have even the slightest bit of Christmas spirit you'll find something to like in this movie. Well worth it"
3,Incredibly Anticlimactic,"Honestly, i read this book cause i loved the cover.(how superficial).It turned out pretty intriguing. The action, the language, etc. were pretty intense. However, since all the flashing camaras, cool shoes, and shampoo and blah were seriously 'cool', I really wanted to see the BAM! ending that connects everything.But there is none of that in So Yesterday's ending. Disappointment.All 200 something pages of intrigue spoiled by 5 pages of ""Are you serious? There's gotta be more to that""."
3,So Yesterday,This book was one of the few books i have ever read that i liked. Mostly all of the books i read i dont finish. When i read this book i wished that it would go on forever and i would actually like reading again but it had to end. Hopefully i find another book like this that will allow me to like reading again.
2,Sketchy,"i have no idea why i finished this book, it had lots of promise yet it just wasnt really enjoyable and is just a book to read if you are really BORED."
3,whats not to like?,"the book so yesterday, was just that, soooooooooooo yesterday. The book was an accurate represntation of the life of teens in high school. Without a doubt there were always trends and there always will be, kids are always immature enough to place each other in categories. The book was a little boring however because most of the plot is centered around the search for Mandy, and the ""cool shoes"". Also the book never ended, it just left off with nothing. Personally I didn't enjoy reading this book because during the whole story i felt as if i was waiting for it to end, and when it came i was dissapointed."
4,So Yesterday,"So Yesterday is an excellent book. If you love details and interesting twists and turns, this is the book for you. The main character is Hunter--he views commercials and looks for new fads in fashion, technology, anything. The he meets Jen, a risk taking innovator, he met her while taking pictures of her shoelaces. She leads Hunter on a wild goose chase to figure out where his missing boss went. When they find her phone, things really get interesting. This book is fast-paced so pay attention and remember every detail, it will come in handy later. This is one of the best books I read from Scott Westerfeld. I love how you never know what's going to come next. Im sure you will enjoy this book."
3,Readable... I suppose,"All in all it wasn't a particularly BAD book, it just wasn't incredibly awesome. To tell you the truth, Hunter and Jen's relationship was the only thing that kept me turning pages. A quick read, I read it in less than a week but it wasnt like one of those books you cant put down. I will admit it got you thinking about someone who started the trends that most people take for granted such as a backwards baseball cap or the first guy to put ice cream in a cone. Cute new concepts but the ending fizzled out a bit and that kinda ruined it at least for me :(. But I'm glad I read it and I would MAYBE recommend it to all you Amazon shoppers."
1,Never....,"This book was a complete waste of time, i thought that being scott westerfeld it would at least have an interesting plot...but i was let down. Don't waste your money or time"
4,"good book, bad endin",This book was good that is until ze end. it was like the author just sorta got bored with the book. but i would still recamend it!!!!
3,Fast and Fun,"""So yesterday"" has one of the fastest, hooks you and you can't put it down plots I've read. It wasn't amazing writing but then, how many books really are anyway... If you're looking for a fast, fun, ""just for the hell of it"" read ""So Yesterday"" is perfect. It gives you an interesting perspective of what is ""cool"" and what is ""so yesterday"""
3,Promising but....,"Started off so good and so fresh and so exciting and ended.... well, flat (you were afraid I was going to say so yesterday, weren't you?). And weird and so much less than it could have been. It's like it got caught up in itself and its own coolness and forgot its own message. Or maybe there wasn't a message. Or maybe the message was that the book couldn't even pull-off the message. The idea was good, great even, but I don't know - I was just disappointed, that's all."
4,Where do all the trends come from? Read it and find out!,"While reading this book I was reminded a bit of Gibson's Pattern Recognition, which I really enjoyed. This is not quite in the same league but it also has a different target audience. If you're interested in fiction that explores the quirky ways in which trends emerge, grow and vanish, then you may enjoy this book. Along with a fast-paced action, the author inserts snippets of stories about trends from history--recent history and not-so-recent history. These stories collectively constitute a nice introduction to the epidemiology-based hypothesis about how cultural trends come to be.The characters are likeable and the major characters nicely detailed so you can feel some empathy/sympathy for their situation. It's also a bit of a mystery, so it's fun to try to figure out what's really happening as you read.Of course, by the end of the book I'm dying to actually see a photo of the SHOES!! (After you read it, you'll know what I mean.)"
4,Fun,"This was a fast, fun read. I enjoyed the up to date trends and ideas here, as well as the quick paced style of the adventure. The characters were fun and original, and the plot was new and inventive. I think there could have been a lot more where this came from, which was my only disappointment! It seemed too short."
4,"Enjoyed this book about trends, but it lacked a bit of the excitement of the Uglies books and Peeps","I enjoyed So Yesterday a lot. Just like the rest of Westerfeld's books, we are taken into a whole new world, and it is hard to see our own lives in the same way after stepping into this one.But much as I enjoyed it, it felt like the book could have used either more plot points, or like it could have been condensed by about a third to make it more suspenseful.Don't get me wrong, a slightly slower than usual Westerfeld book is still one I'd choose over many other books. But if you are new to the author, start with either Uglies or Peeps. This is best to tide you over while you wait for the newest Uglies book to come out!"
2,why bother?,"Until trying this razor, I never knew it was possible to cut yourself with an electric.. In a few instances it looks like I skinned my knee (or shin, or wherever.. Doesn't seem to do a great job at removing hair, but it's great at removing skin."
2,Short Life-span; Poor Example of Remington Products,"I have had this shaver less than one year and already the battery won't hold the charge. Compared to my previous Remington model which lasted for a few years, this gets low grades on closeness, smoothness, and battery life. Look for another shaver."
4,Very Nice Leg Shaver/Stay Away From The Underarms!!!,"This gave me a shave every bit as good as a razor. I have pretty coarse leg hair and a problem with ingrown hairs. I rarely wear shorts even in summer because of the unsightly bumps and scabs. So for the legs this shaver is great. As for the underarms....not so good. I didn't get far. I got a few scrapes immediately and stopped, finishing with a razor. But since my only issue with a razor is my legs this shaver is perfectly fine for my needs. Highly recommend it for the legs!"
1,I RETURNED THIS ITEM BACK TO THE STORE!!!!,"The positives of this particuliar razor: nice color, charge lasted more then 25 minutes, neat little storage bag. The negatives of this particuliar razor: razor brushed burned me on the back of my legs and even left a couple of cuts, the ON button has to be held continously, razor felt bulky after holding it for 5 minutes. If brushed burned and cut legs, a numb thumb, and aching hand is what your looking for....this razor is for you!!!! I bought a Remington EP1000 Smooth & Silky Epilator. If I'am going to have to endure pain I at least want something that will remove hair for a longer period of time."
2,Not worth the money!,"This razor is great...if you have time to shave your legs 3 or 4 times each time to get all the hairs! I have had several Remington razors over the years and this is THE WORST! It seems to be that, like everything else on the market today, the quality of Remington razors has gone out the door! It's too bad too because good ladies razors are hard to find and this used to be one you could count on!Anyone know of a good brand because I would love to know of one!!"
3,"Good shave , but poor quality of foil and rasor","The wdf-3500 is probably the best electric razor as far as shaving is concerned. But the quality is below average. The foil breaks easily and you better check it from time to time if you don't want to have marks on your skin when the foil breaks.... The razor itself is not built to last long.The parts are difiicult to find (I have found only one place in my area that carries them). Plus at $20, you may as well buy a new razor which goes for about $30-$35."
2,Not that great,"This razor is only supposed to be used on legs (it says so in the manual) but even then I haven't been able to get a close shave at all. It specifically says to put all of the blades evenly on the skin but that definitely doesn't yield good results. Also, the top broke off the first time I tried washing it, but I was able to repair it.To sum it up, after I shave I need to go back over the area with a disposable razor which provides a 10 times closer shave than this razor."
3,Okay for the price.,"Does an okay job on the legs but caused razor burn to underarm area. The instruction manual indicates the body will condition itself and be less likely to burn after repeated use. Also a little noisey, but all-in-all not a bad deal for the price."
3,Okay Razor; Replacement Parts,"This is the only electric razor that I've ever used. It does an okay job at removing hair...like another poster said, it's definitely good for touch ups. However, it is impossible to find replacement parts for this razor. I've looked everywhere and I am finally going to buy them online through the Remington Web site. That's a definite drawback for me. Otherwise, it's an okay razor."
2,"Disappointing, razor burn","I have very sensitive skin and had been using a Panasonic electric shaver without problems. The shaver broke when I dropped it and I bought this as a replacement. It shaves closely, almost like a razor, and did a good job on my legs. Unfortunately, on the underarms, I got razor burns and stopped using this shaver. Went back to the old one with no further problems."
2,Spring for the next level,"For some reason, even after reading the largely positive reviews of the more expensive, higher-model-number Remington shavers, and the largely negative reviews of this cheaper one, I still went the cheap route. For the benefits I've received so far, I think I would have been better off just sticking with my old razor.The shaver has been fine on my legs - not very efficient, or quiet, but it hasn't caused any damage and if I'm careful enough I get a pretty close shave. It does seem like I have to shave more often, though. What's really bad is what happened to my armpits: painful red welts for several days! Reading the other reviews, it seems I'm not the only one with this experience.The two positive things I can say about this shaver are that it does hold a charge for as long as I need it to, and I like being able to shave dry. However, you could probably get these benefits and better performance with a more expensive model."
5,a must read!,"This is a must read for any stage of your career! Those little annoying repettitive problems can be eliminated! This is my third one(loaned one out, second one is in storage). Some of my close friends, that were having the same problems, read and were just as amazed as I was at the results. MANDATROY!!!!!"
5,Great product but beware of Amazon's sloppy packaging,"These are excellent blank DVD-Rs.I have yet to encounter any problemswith the Maxell brand, which is notthe case with some of the competing brands.However . . . I cannot recommend thatyou order it from Amazon.The Amazon packagingwas so poor that when I opened the box,I discovered DVDs everywhere inside it,the bottom of the container had brokenopen and the spindle, also broken,was in several pieces.Why?Instead of packing the item securelywith enough plastic packing aroundthe item, Amazon used as little packingas possible.The result. Damaged DVDs and the spindlebroken in several pieces.Don't let that discourage you from orderingthis brand. Just don't order it from Amazon."
5,DVD-R Maxell discs,"I like Maxell DVD-R discs because they work the best in recording and copying everything, Other brands Glitch, where they refuse to work, and have to be thrown out, not Maxell. I find my frustration level is nearly zero when using this product"
5,Maxell is the best,"My Husband uses a lot of DVD-R with his hobby. He will only use Maxell because of it's compatibility with all players. He never has any problems using it, and his projects always turn out great. He has used other brands and there always seemed to be problems. He uses maxell exclusively"
2,I had bad luck with this media...,About half of the discs I used produced errors and lock ups. It also took longer to burn to these discs. It seems I got a bad batch. I am not sure of the overall quality of this item. Based on other user reviews this may just be a glitch.
2,Maxell dvd-r,"Above average disks would not burn I'll stick with Verbatim from now on. Or amazon basics, but not Maxell ever again."
5,Great Product,Maxell is a great product. Have used their tapes and discs for years with the best of results. You can't go wrong with Maxell.
4,Maxell - 100 x DVD-R - 4.7 GB 16x - spindle - storage media,The Maxell - 100 x DVD-R - 4.7 GB 16x - spindle - storage media disc havent given me any problems so far. i read where a lot of customers speak of some percentage of disc that are unusable in many of these brands of blanks but to be honest i haven't ever had a bad disc in any of the brands i have bought. maybe these customers need to look into a better burner.
4,Good Choice,"This product was a great choice for bothe the storage capaciy and the amount on the spindle. We were given a challenge to get some needed recordable DVD's for the church service, and these prove to be outstanding."
1,"Purchased from ""FantasyBuy"" - entire spindle was useless","I purchased this through Amazon from ""FantasyBuy - fulfilled by Amazon"" (the sellers constantly change, so I want to be clear where I got it. The package looked fine when I got it, but when I opened the spindle was broken in half. I tried about 10 different discs in 2 different computers, none worked, I'm not wasting my time trying every disc, this is ridiculous. I just finished off a spindle of Memorex media I bought locally a while ago and had maybe 1 in 50 that didn't work. I am returning it, will not buy from FantasyBuy again, that is for sure."
1,Bad Seller,Don't buy from this seller. Most of the DVD's that I bought are defective. I don't use them to burn on very often so I didn't return them before 30 days. I have tried 30-40 and maybe 10 have worked. I tried to contact seller with no reply. BUYER BEWARD!!!!
2,Disappointed !,"This product is Cheap Chinese Garbage . They only work in one of the two DVD Recorders I own . Making them Semi-Useless to me . Now, they will work in my new Laptop, but I bought them because my DVD Recorder recommended them in the manual . I don't think they were making them in China when the manual was printed, though . It would cost more to return them than to just keep them and use them for my computer , so I guess I'm stuck with them ."
4,Excellent services and good product,"I have been customer of Amazon over 5 years, every their product is good quality, Amazon quickly replaces item when I notify them (rarely I got bad quality product, it's about 1% of bad one).One more time this is a second of excellent DVD-R of Maxell brand name I have used so far."
3,It helps me with my daughter to welcome a new baby,"When I was pregnant I tried to tell my daughter 3 years old what the meaning of new baby at home by stories , visitting friend had new baby and many things . she didn't like the idea till I bought her this film. she was looking at me day by day and asking when we will have our baby So thank for every body worked in this educational film . It was very usefull as all Sesame street films"
2,Doesn't keep his attention,We borrowed this tape from a friend. We are expecting our second child is a few months. The tape doesn't keep his attention (he's 23 months). I turned it off in the middle and we haven't seen it since. We may try again later. I would rent it or perhaps use it for an older child.
3,"Fun to watch (even for adults), but not effective","This is a fun Sesame Street video for kids to watch. Its purpose is to introduce young children to their baby siblings, so they won't hit on the latter or throw the latter onto the floor. The muppets are always fun to watch, but I don't think this video really works in reducing siblign ""violence."" Still worth givign it a try, I say."
3,Works GREAT but beware....,"The product works as advertised. After installation it cut my drying time from 2-3 hours to around 40 minutes. Unfortunately, when we have a windy day(which is often in Oklahoma) the fan turns on because it thinks the dryer is running. I emailed the manufacturer but haven't received a response. Kinda wish I had bought one which is operated with a wall switch."
4,Excellent Product,"In my case it was very easy to install. It now takes 1/6 of the time it took to dry a load. And I installed it at under 20 feet and it works fine. Google for the best price. I paid half of what it is sold here and it arrived in 2 days. Very highly recommended. Another option is another brand where the motor is on the side and dust doesn't accumulate indie the motor housing, but that needs more room to install."
3,Works But design problems,The blower works fine but the mounting bracket design needs a change. If you have to mount the blower horizontal you need three hands to hold the blower unit and drive the screws into the blower. The other problem is in the electrical connections the terminal strip is mounted so you can't get to the connection screws without taking the terminal strip out of the connection box. The manufacturer needs to redesign this.
3,Vibration Problem,We purchased the DBF-110 7-years ago in 2005 to assist the dryer with a long vent run. Performance wise it has done a great job in boosting the dryer but after about 2-years of use it begain to vibrate. I placed heavy objects on top of and against the unit to dampen the noise and that work acceptably for 4 years although the noise kept getting worse most likely due to a fan imballance. We had to purchase a new identical unit to minimize the installation issues.
4,"Works as advertised, monor problems","I investigated the fan because my dryer was installed on an interior wall so the duct ran about 30' with 3 elbows, lent built up & cloths took a long time to dry. I installed the fan in my attic about 20' from the dryer. I used duct tape initially because I had a hard time finding the FC Claps used for reduced virbration. The fan is sensitive to air pressure & starts easy. When I open a window in my kitchen on a windy day the fan will start without the dryer running. I might have to adjust the sensitivity. Although I don't have scientific proof, my cloths do seem to be drying faster."
4,Very good product.,Installed easily. Working as advertised. The dryer is functioning better as it helps pull the air out faster. More words added.
3,Sucks not a lot.,Bought the booster to shorten the drying time on a dryer with a 18 foot long exhaust run. I have noticed a difference in drying time of about 20%. Not worth the $200 cost.
3,cute but...,Very cute photo album. I'd say well made except the album pages fell out once I opened the book. I just re-glued it myself but still disappointing to have happen. The rest of the book is well made.
3,"Not His Best, But Entertaining...","I've enjoyed several of the Inspector Banks series, and I felt that this one had something lacking. While I always enjoy the stories, this one dragged in the middle. Peter Robinson did finish the story strongly, and I had no idea ""whodunnit"" until the very end.If you're an Inspector Banks fan, I'd defiitely read it. If you're new to this author, start at the beginning with ""Gallows View"", or read his best, ""In A Dry Season""."
3,Long awaited and I am still waiting...,"Having read all of Robinson's previous Alan Banks novels, I eagerly anticipated this new release. It was a tough read for me. Long a fan of Robinson's realistic characterizations, I found the characters in this novel doing predictable and silly things. The resolution of the Banks-Riddle conflict was far too simple and I was very disappointed with it.I did find myself somewhat drawn in by the plot and the cast of ""nasty"" characters. However, I felt this paled in comparison to ""In A Dry Season."" I will continue to anticipate the next Robinson release and hope that Banks can untangle himself from his personal woes and really sink his teeth into a truly Banks mystery.My last question remains, as always...why is it these people drink so much?"
4,Well-Done Police Procedural,"Robinson spins a very well-crafted novel about Inspector Banks and the other fascinating characters he encounters in his baliwick of Yorkshire. Robinson has a good eye and sharp ear for the psychological travails his characters face, often providing a nice counterpoint to his nicely honed plot. The magic of the Inspector Banks series is the author's careful pacing of the plot and the characterization which carry you (usually)gently to the end. This is not a fast-paced crime story that you can't set down. It's not like a shot of gin or vodka; but rather, like a fine single-malt Scotch which you'll savor to the end. Robinson has become one of my favorite authors and, for my money, ranks with the best of the authors of his genre."
3,"Really, 3.5 stars....","I won't give up on this series yet, partly because Robinson writes so well. However, somewhere after the first several novels in the series, the charm of the Yorkshire setting and the originality of the characters began to be lost; while the plotting more and more takes a backseat to the life and loves of Inspector Banks. In Cold is the Grave, there is an entire subplot that in my view is rather boring and ultimately irrelevant to the central mystery. On the credit side, the family secrets and character motivations are credible enough to support the outcome,and in Mrs. Riddle and Emily Robinson has again displayed his gift for first rate characterization. Oddly, this talent doesn't extend as well to Banks, who remains a somewhat static and not very interesting person going through predictable mid-life changes, except when he is detecting. Robinson should let us see more through Banks' eyes, and less of him."
3,Long,"This book was just to long to support the shallow ending. The characters were well thought out and in sync. but I began to lose interest after awhile. The sub-plots were of little value and not required to support the main plot. As for a mystery,I don't think so the ending is easily figured out after all the characters are introduced. Still,in all fairness to the author I did finish it and it's not bad reading overall. I will await Peter Robinson's next work, perhaps it's time to retire Alan Banks."
2,Just a bit disappointing,"Having thoroughly enjoyed ""In a Dry Season,"", I looked forward to reading this, the follow-up. Sadly there is a chasm between the two. ""Cold is the Grave"" is one of those 'body count' books. Just when you think there cannot be yet another murder, along comes another body. I know the areas in which the novel is set very well, and Robinson has a real knack of getting the feel of different parts of England absolutely right. This book is also, like other Peter Robsinson novels - a very classy piece of prose - it's a joy to read. But the story is actually preposterous and it protrays a weird Britain where everyone smokes like a chimney (England is largely a non-smoking country these days) and the story - which starts well - becomes just a chain of ever-more unlikely events. Here's hoping Robinson and Banks get back on track with the next effort."
3,Character-based,"Robinson makes the world of his characters surround us enough to appreciate their confusion when faced with a mystery which, while of an archetype that's fairly guessable, unfolds well and in such a way that grants us compassionate insight into several types of lives. Scratch a mystery writer, find a literary novelist... Robinson can stumble awkwardly but there are no scenes that are outright doofus drops. Some of the details he includes show a touching tendency to observe human life in all of its mixed bag of glories and hilarious depravities. So far, this is my favorite book of Robinson's, because it is the most realistic in its vision of life."
2,Too Wordy,"The concept was admirable, but the story itself was entirely too wordy. The way the book was organized made it a very difficult read. The paragraphs were too long as with some of the chapters. It was just a bunch of words scrunched together that sometimes had me fading away. I almost fell asleep reading it. I think if it had been written in more of a ""story/novel"" form and not the Him/Her-He/She format, it would've had a better flow. But the author did keep the language real. I'm looking forward to reading ""THE VOW."" With the additional authors, this should be a good read but the synopsis already sounds like a remake of Danielle Steel's ""SECRETS."" A 2.2 on the SmithScale."
4,"Helpful Tips for Efficiency, Not 2 Many Great Templates","Being an experienced Excel user, I was surprised to learn a few helpful tips in the 1st chapter alone (which I was planning to skip as it is just the basics). I was hoping for more examples of really effective, professional chart designs. There are some, but not too many that knock your socks off."
1,Wrong book,I searched under Excel 2007 graphs and found this book listed. Stupidly I thought it was somehow related to Excel 2007 and went ahead and ordered it. I returned it the next day since it is actually about earlier versions of Excel and since the program changed dramatically with the 2007 revision the book is of no value unless you are using an older version of Excel.Excel Charts
2,Lack of explanation and missing chapters on CD,"1. There isn't rational division of subjects,the author do not separate the fields of knowledge asbetween scientific, commercial, and so on.2. There isn't step by step method to build the charts3. There isn't chapters 11,13 and 14 in the CD that comes with the book.Lack of organization, lack of methodology, and missing parts."
3,From my past,"I enjoy this movie becuase its from my past. My brother got me into ninja's when I was young and showed me this movie so I just had to have it. I have it now just to look back and reflect on my childhood. Its not a good movie by any means, but still entertaining to see what a white guy in a ninja suit can accomplish. ITs a classic american ninja movie (no pun intened). White guy in Japan, goes psycho, kills a whole bunch of asian ninjas in black, saves the girl, gets back the plutonium, and the movie ends."
5,To realize so bright a star shown in our midst.,"I lived through the turbulent times of sixties. To read Eugene McCarthy's words made me realize how lucky we were to have great men in our times. The comparison to today's political dwarfs comes naturally and one is left with a sense of forboding. Where are the men who make judgements based on reason, not profits? How could we live through the history of Vietnam and fail to prevent another illegal intervention? Lest we turn away in a fog of depression we should discover and value the current men of McCarthy's cloth like Howard Dean and John Conyers,"
4,Useful,This is a great book to utilize for information on specific methods and techniques to use with difficult students.
2,Dissapointingly incomplete,"Only contains the ten songs ""Conjunction Junction"", ""Dollars and Sense"", ""Electricity, Electricity"", ""The Great American Melting Pot"", ""I'm Just a Bill"", ""Interplanet Janet"", ""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly"", ""My Hero, Zero"", ""No More Kings"" and ""Three is a Magic Number"". I would have been willing to pay three times as much for a complete set, or happy to get a consistent set (all History Rock, for example) but the odd selection is annoying and nearly useless. Don't buy it unless you are specifically looking for one of these songs."
2,I agree with the first review.,"You shouldn't get this book unless you certainly like one of the contained songs. Only 10 of the 51 Schoolhouse Rock songs were used. The 41, or full season's worth minus the plot, not used, are in no particular order:Interjections Tyrannosaurus Debt The Weather Show The Body Machine Busy Prepositions The Tale of Mr. Morton Tax Man Max Mother Necessity Three-Ring Government A Noun Is A Person, Place or Thing Naughty Number Nine The Check's In The Mail This For That The Good Eleven Fireworks The Preamble Elementary, My Dear The Four-Legged Zoo Do The Circulation Telegraph Line etc."
3,Good Selection of Songs,"It has all the songs you would expect, but the style of the songs written doesn't translate well into piano music.They did do a good job however in making this song book.-dave"
4,Not all the songs included,I'm rather disappointed as only the top 10 songs have been included. Is there anywhere we can gain access to the other songs?
1,NOT WORTH IT,"This book is not what I expected. It is designed for musicians, of which I am not. I expected a book filled with every song just like the video series and with only the words to the songs. A lot of my favorite songs were not included. Only 10 songs with sheet music is included."
5,thank you for a dream come true,"Hello Skipjack...Received my book today The Junks and Sampans of the Yangtze. This is a collectors item and going to be the perfect Christmas gift for my boyfriend. We own a 55 foot,77,000 pound, Built on the Yantze River Chinese Junk. The gentelman we bought it from told me I had to have this book, so thank you for having it to purchase. It came in a very timely manner, and is more perfect than i thought. It will be a treasure for us forever. FIVE STARS and Happy Holidays...."
1,False Advertisement RIP OFF,"The advertisement for autopartsway, powerflow mudflaps is false and misleading. It says these are specifically for a 2005 Toyota 4-Runner and universal fit. THEY ARE NOT and do not fit this model of vehicle. The autopartsway company said Amazon should have changed the advertisement to 'Semi-universal', but wasn't their fault and also sent me a nasty email. Because of this FALSE advertisement, I paid $26.00 for this junk and only received $4.85 refund!!!! RIP OFF!!If you order something from amazon, you pay for it to be shipped, you receive it and it is NOT what was advertised, that is not the fault of the consumer and I should have received a FULL refund."
4,"Good book, but...","First off, I did like this book in the series. The action was terse, and well handled. The plot, through most of the book, was well thought out and quite logical. Unfortunately, it left some very large loose ends near the end (with little chance of development due to the circumstances) and a rather weak ending to the three book mini-series. I'm hoping that in future books those loose ends are developed, and that the this doesn't set a precedent for endings. A whole lot depends on how the next book will go."
5,perfect!!!,very informative book. i like it. it changed my life. it is must read!!!! i go back and forth to read this book again and again. it taught me how to response and express my feelings effectively.
3,Just like HG Lewis,"I expected a homage to 70's gore movies. HG Lewis is even in it. Unfortunately, it so well mimics the HG Lewis films, it is just as bad and boring, unless that is what you want."
3,I Wish,"that Universal had let Rock Hudson make this movie with Marilyn as he so badly wanted to! One thing for sure, there would have been no extramarital affair, as reported, but the chemistry would have been most interesting based on his performances with Doris Day. As one movie critic noted, there was too much sexual tension between the stars, and that would have been fine in a more serious movie. Still, it's always nice to see Marilyn. And for the reviewer who said she didn't look her best, check her out in the corset-type showgirl costume in the Milton Berle scene, and the almost-off-the-body dress in the Chinese restaurant where Montand's character declares his love for her. I know Marilyn is still popular, but when will we get to see her many widescreen movies, such as LET'S MAKE LOVE, amongst others in a letterbox format with decent sound. I had to return two copies of the letterboxed RIVER OF NO RETURN because the sound was so terrible! Thanks, jt"
2,Runs out of gas,"""Let's Make Love"" starts out with the smash burlesque dance number ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy,"" but seems to slide down the slippery slope after that. Too bad, because all of the performers are really trying -- MM, the smooth-singing Frankie Vaughn, Yves Montand, etc. The problem is, the script is simply horrible. I've never seen such great talent wasted on such a bad screenplay."
4,MARILYN!,"THIS MOVIE IS ONLY BEING TALKED ABOUT TODAY DUE TO THE FACT THAT MARILYN MONROE WAS IN IT. THIS IS THE CASE WITH SEVERAL OF HER FILMS. I MEAN IF ANOTHER ACTRESS AHD PLAYED IT WE WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT. AND SOME CRITIC'S POINTED OUT THAT MARILYN WAS FAT IN IT,MAYBE SHE WASN'T AS THIN AS IN ""BUS STOP"" BUT THAT DOESNT MATTER, SHE WAS NOT THAT HEAVY. MARILYN WAS SO UNIQUE AND HAD SUCH A SCREEN PRESENCE. I WOULD SEE THIS FILM FOR TO REASONS,1. THE MUSICAL NUMBERS WHICH SHOW SHE HAD A BETTER VOICE THAN SHE WAS GIVEN CREDIT FOR,AND TWO THE FACT THAT SHE SPEAKS IN HER NATURAL VOICE, THIS IS VER INTERESTING SINCE MOST OF HER CHARACTERS WERE DUMB BLONES, BUT THIS ONE SEEMS A LITTLE SMARTER."
2,Talented co-stars wasted on Monroe,"It's a real shame, with the supporting cast the movie could have been wonderful. The film suffers as it tries to make Miss Monroe the center of the action. It's fun to watch Yves Montand interact with the big entertainment names of the day and it is too bad that those relationships weren't explored further. It isn't a horrible movie, but reminds you that when a star or starlet is hot studios are sometimes too eager to use them in a film whether they are suitable or not."
2,Only for courageous fans,"I found it quite difficult to sit through this movie. Marilyn looks great & sings wonderful, the musical numbers are good, but the script is so thin that the film as a whole is just boring, boring, boring...The supporting cast has nearly nothing to do, and Yves Montand has to be one of the worst actors ever! His accent is simply unbearable (he even has a few lines in German & Italian, which are nearly incomprehensible to native speakers), and he never manages to give his character any credible feelings whatsoever. Why should Marilyn's character abandon Frankie Vaughan (who is rather handsome & a good singer, too) for this horrible old guy? Perhaps she really only wants his money after all..."
3,mediocre musical comedy,Not one of marilyn's better movies but mildly entertaining. one highlight is marilyn's :my heart belongs to daddy. it's not the actor's fault that they had such a weak script.
5,Best Movie,I love this movie!!! So entertaining and very humorous; I can watch it again and again and love all the scenes with Marilyn! Way ahead of its time!!!
3,Elvis:An Illustrated Guide to New and Vintage Collectibles,"Beautiful photos,especially love the front cover.I was hoping for a few more price guidelines but I can't say I was disappointed, as I enjoyed what is there.I buy a lot of Elvis memorabilia so it's fun to recognize something you have in your collection and know what it's worth. Sally Kirby-Baker"
3,OK but leaky,"Got 20 of these Sunpak. Tested them most of them around 1900 to 2200 mAH, 4 to 5 around 2400 to 2500mAH (La Crosse charger). So they are 15-20% over rated at 2650mAH.The problem with these hi-capacity AA is that they don't hold the charge very well. They are 30% drained in a week so they are useless in my DSLR if I don't shoot pictures right away.... Need to buy some Eneloop that hold charge better (Some were dischaged to zero in a few months)Don't know whether this is related to Sunpak, or to all high-cap NiMH AA batteries."
2,Low quality,"I bought these batteries from Amazon and they are very poor quality. Supposedly 2650mAh, the first four were broken in and tested. Three came in between 1850-1900 mAh, about 70% of advertised. The other one came in at 938mAh, 35%. I got Ebay quality from Amazon, which really surprised me. PS, I then tested four Energizers rated at 2500 maH and they came in at 2450. I used the La Crosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Charger, purchased from Amazon too. It seems to be high quality. Not worth $31, not worth $3.10. Buyer beware!"
2,These batteries are poor quality.,I must say I had higher hopes for these. Some work better then others where they should be all consistent. Another product from that country slapped together with cheap production and bad materials.
2,Never Again Will I buy These,"Bought these for my Olympus digital camera. Not only did I get the least amount of use time with them, but they also do not hold a charge well.After many attempts to discharge them totally and then recharge, I finally gave up and threw them away since they were worthless. Just before they died completely they were totally dead out of the charger and I hadn't even used them that much."
1,Waste of money,"I bought a box of these batteries for use with solar powered landscape lighting. About 20% of the batteries were defective right out of the box. The ones that did work seemed to work ok over the summer but once the temperature got down in the 50s, they hardly work at all.I bought another box hoping for better luck but all the batteries in the second box were weak or defective right out of the box."
5,Great Batteries!,"I am a professional photographer and my digital cameras and flashes swallow battery power, especially at weddings. I recently purchased a box of these Sunpak batteries and discovered that they fed my equipment completely and had leftover power to spare! I liked them so much that I bought a second box.Here's a tip: Get a decent recharger. Most problems people encounter with rechargeable batteries is an inferior charger. Those ""quickie"" rechargers are junk."
2,NOT the 1974 album,"Conway Twitty""I'm Not Through Loving You Yet"" (CD)-------------------------------------------This ten-track CD is NOT a reissue of Conway Twitty's 1974 album on MCA, ""I'm Not Through Loving You Yet."" The title track is included, but the rest of the songs are different. This is sort of a random, budget-line reissue disc. (DJ Joe Sixpack)"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!! Problem with Product line!!!,"I know you may be confused by my first review. In all honesty, when the TV works correctly, it is great.BUT, I discovered a flaw with the Picture Tube processing some cable AND video signals. Specifically, a white and/or green line on the bottom of the screen when the color black was present. I should point out that it happened with a few cable signals, and happened again when playing a Camcorder.This was NOT isolated to just this TV! I got it replace, it happened again. Then, I went to an electronics store and we reproduced the same problem on the floor model.If it happened on three of the same line of TV, there is obviously something wrong with this line. I will be writing a letter to Panansonic!"
1,Disappointed,Heard about this and another CD from my instructor at a spinning class at the gym. I purchased the CD and was very disappointed because every song sounded the same.
3,E=VC2,Victor continues to put out the best dance music. He proves yet again that he leads the industry in dance mixes.
5,"Three of A Kind: Satie, Ives and Gottschalk","I mention Ives and Gottschalk in the same breath with Satie because all three seem to have ""broken the mould"", so to speak. This is a fun, interesting and, at times, a quite hauntingly beautiful listen; and I heard nothing to indicate that it deserves less than a 5 star rating. Parade and Trois Gymnopedies stand out as do Projectionette, Musique and Cinema from Relache. I was unaware of the subtle cymbal accents in Trois Gymnopedies beforehand and I quite like them. I have a different take on the Trois Gymnopedies and think it follows ""Parade"" appropriately. It's a though, after the Parade (or party) and the scattering of fellow revelers, a solidtary soul has arrived home, still wearing his party hat or costume, alone and melancholy, and, while seated solemnly on a davenport, contemplates the metaphysics of it all. Quite an inexpensive and excellent buy from NAXOS."
2,Satie: Orchestral Works,"The CD arrived in a small, poorly insulated envelope. Although still wrapped in plastic, the outside of the CD casewas cracked. This was a gift, so I didn't have time to return it."
5,Best of the best!,"This meter includes a 1 degree spot meter in addition to the ambient light meter. So, you can easily meter a scene for average lighting, and then check the relative exposure value of specific portions of the image to see how many stops above or below the metered value they lie. This makes zone metering VERY easy, reduces the chance of blowing highlights or missing shadows, and generally helps teach good photography."
4,A refreshing look at fantasy!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were distinct and interesting. I was hooked by the first page and begging for more by the last. The authors detail and descriptions brought life to his world in vivd colors. I found myself in disagreement with the approach to Elves and Human relationship, but after consideration I believe it makes a statement about the way life really is. You don't always get what you want! If I could change anything about this book I would have made it longer, spending more time on the budding relationships. Great stuff!"
1,Very disappointing,"This book was nothing more than ordinary. The content lacks style, depth and substance. I have read better work in a high school literary magazine."
1,A whiny sob story,"I was not impressed with the style or the content. The author could use some classes in writing skills, even when we take into consideration that English is her second language. The subject matter was the ""same old"" story of medical problems (always cancer) interfering with ""true love.""I do not recommend it."
1,False Advertising,The bag pictured above is not the bag I received in the mail. I was highly upset. Next time I will buy straight from Wacom itself.
1,Self Published crud,This book was sent to me to review it. I don't review books where the author pays to publish it. That is called Vanity. And it is one terrible book
3,IT'LL DO THE JOB,"As a bass player by trade, I only use this to distort the guitar while I write, to get a better idea of what the final product will sound like. If I were a serious guitar play I would look at a more expensive/better sounding pedal, but for the price, and the decent job it does, you cant beat this thing. Add a little chorus, and you get a downright good overdrive sound in fact!!"
2,Sounds just like it costs,"The only reason I'm not giving this one star is that I didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. We have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. NOPE. This pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. AVOID."
2,"didnt work at all, correction works after getting right polarity converter!","Hooked this thing up, the thing passed gas, never worked again. tried battery, and adapter, nothing and I was really looking forward to a fuzz effect to play with..... what a heart break.... still have the thing after 9 mths, hoping it might work someday...(correction works but still should let you know in no uncertain terms to use an abnormal converter for it.!)"
5,One of the best distortion pedals,Over the years I've tried many distortion pedals and I could not be happier with this one! It is responsive but not overbearing. Don't be fooled by its price or size. I used it through my Fender HotRod Deluxe and this pedal offers a warm full tone and it really can rip. I highly recomend this pedal for those who don't want to throw down $150 for a Tube-Screamer.
2,"sounded great, didn't last long","So, I bought this for a pop punk band: sounds amazing, light weight, etc. What everyone else said, plus the fact that after a few shows/months, the input went loose on the inside and doesn't work anymore. It appeared to slowly stop working, but I didn't use it that often the first few months I got it and it was past the 45 day limit. I'm still looking to replace it, but I'm not sure I'd buy another one due to my experience."
4,guitar,"I like to play a little guitar and the distortion acquired feel that achievement alone those that get a normal sound does not feel the difference.A guitar that anyone interested in purchasing one of them, I assure you will not regret.Thanks."
1,Save your money.,"Save your money and purchase a good quality pedal. I bought 2 for my kids and they never used them. I used them from time to time, in our ""music room"" no rough handling. Neither worked well after being used less than 20 times. The non-slip bottoms do make them handy door stops now."
4,Gave as a gift,"Seems sturdy and easy to use. I gave it as a gift, so not sure how it works. I bought it based on the reviews."
3,A little flat,"I love a lot of Danelectro products, but not really this one, i give it 3/5 because it works as advertised.The features are good. True Bypass requires a 9v wall plug, and adjustments are good.BUT HERE'S MY ISSUE- The Distortion is not 'Crunchy.' It distorts, sure, but the sound is not dimensional... it has no depth to it.Thats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres, but i play a lot of blues-rock... I ended up switching to a Vintage-Tube overdrive by behringer.Not for me, maybe for you."
1,Does not work out of the box,I ordered it. I recieved it. I put in a new 9v battery. I hooked up my guitar to it. It did not work at all. I tried it again later...it still did not work. I keep trying it...to no avail. I feel cheated. I am sad.
4,Great little pedal.,"Great little pedal, economical and worked flawlessly. It didn't have a power supply or battery included, for a low price what do you expect? Besides batteries aren't that expensive. Cranked out a nice distortion for my Fender guitar. Great product."
4,Solid,"I just got this in the mail this morning and plugged it in this evening. It really does sound great. I was surprised at the quality, actually. It doesn't feel flimsy at all and I felt pretty comfortable rocking out a bit with it.The sound is crisp and dirty- Some of the crappy (yet $40) pedals I've had in the past sounded muddy, where you just got a buzz rather than being able to distinguish notes. Nothing wrong with muddy, but this pedal sounds really clear. While maybe the range on Boss or other pedals is probably greater, I feel like this one fits a certain sound very well. I read somewhere that they were based on Japanese pedals of the late 70s, and I feel like that late-punk sound is very much in this pedal.Not bad at all for the price. Maybe I'll review again after playing it for a few months."
3,"Sounds nice, but...","I don't like the design. The battery is a pain to work in, the knobs are on the side like it works great on your belt, but on the floor is a real pain to control"
5,Very cool effects,Great for distortion but way too much feed bacack. Product does need noise gate pedal to avoid excessive amount of feedback or at least 20 feet cord to be far enough away from the amp for minimal effects of feedback
4,An Interesting Story,"When I started this book, I didn't put it down until I finished it. I thought it was well written, especially since it was Joanne's first novel. The characters are well developed and I especially liked Rachel. She kept the story interesting. I am an avid reader and get bored easily so I was pleasantly surprised by this one.I recommend this one!"
1,Not Pleased,I was not pleased with this cream. It did not soften my cuticles and it had alot of oil in it. I used it and let it sit on my cuticles for a long time. no change.
4,Gentle Performances of Lovely Works,"Of those 3 great pianist-composers who came before Chopin, Field exerted the biggest influence on the Pole, more than either Hummel or Weber. One can easily detect it in these 2 exemplary works and compare them with Chopin's own youthful concerti. The busy figurations on the keyboard, the bel canto aria-like melodies, the tutti/solo alternations, the atmosphere. Yet of course Chopin was already outgrowing his childhood idol even by then. Nonetheless the Field concerti here are beautiful beyond description, especially No.2. Frith played sensitively and intelligently in both works, bringing out the shades and nuances very well. However I would have preferred a more lively tempo than was taken here. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars. John Field certainly does not deserve the neglect he's facing, and the current work to revie his music is encouraging. The key is not to compare him with Chopin or Beethoven, but to evaluate him on his own merits."
5,im lovin it,"The Angels Command is work of art that is just fun to read. i enjoyed reading this book so much, that i read it in two days! jacques created a deep feeling of character and he really put the characters through exciting events. after reading this book i got a sense of what it would probably be like if i were to live forever. it is a wonderful book, that really brings you in with it, and makes you feel like you just went through what the characters did. i definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes books that keep you guessing, wondering, crying, and laughing. this is definitely an adventure book, tied in with some fictional events and characters."
4,Its good.,"I found this book good. It kept me up late at night. But i think it didn't reach the quality of the original Castaway of the flying dutchman. In that book, Ben and Ned seemed better then Angel's Command. In Angel's command, they seem too ..... heavenly and good to be counted as real. Often times when i read it, i felt i was reading a good ole fairy tale with flat characters. The story also didn't have Brian's trademark of puzzles and strange maps ( like in Castaway and all the Redwall books). It almost see a straight forward adventure.Overall i thought this was a good book, but most of the characters act too heavenly and good for me."
5,Blown away!,"I was attracted to this series after meeting Brian Jaques while he was on tour. He he said then that he had had more fun writing ""The Angel's Command"" then he had in a long time. That got me interested, so I read ""Castaways Of The Flying Dutchman"" and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I read ""The Angel's Command"" and was totally blown away. When I put down the book, I just sat there, not knowing what to do. I now officially like this series even more than Redwall (which says a lot!). And I eagerly await the next book. This is a MUST read."
2,Not 4 gauge,"If you're doing an install that requires at least 4 gauge, then this is not the kit for you. The insulation on the wire is pretty thick, but the copper is very limited and looks more like 8 gauge. Before buying this I called Boss Audio to get the fuse rating and they said it was 100A. It looks more like 80A based on the thickness of the metal. I bought a 4 gauge kit in walmart which was clearly a 4 gauge and much bigger than what I received with this and came with a true 100A fuse as clearly indicated by it's size."
4,Satisfactory,"Basically nothing special about it. it gives you what you need and performs without issues. everything is here and ready to be used! i bought this for an 8 gauge system but got this just to be safe. only con is that the power cable is red and sticks out like none other, along with the audio cable. but no complaints. it does its job"
2,Half Trash,"Everything in my opinion is halfway decent, yes the 4 gauge is more like a 6-8, but I knew that it would be like that before I purchased this item. The thing that got me, however, was the speaker wire. I go to strip both ends of it, and come to find out, there isn't even wire in one of the strands! Completely empty. I am not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but I am quite unhappy indeed."
1,absolutely terrible!,it is half the thickness of true 4 awg wire. typical Chinese product. bought for $22 dollars completely unhappy with it. go to return it and they want $9 dollars to return it so i guess i am stuck with it maybe ill run my door speakers with it since it is terrible looking power wire.
3,good enough,this amp kit does the job and the power and ground wires are thick enough..i could have used about an extra 4 feet of wires for each but the ground is beyonddddddd short and thats the only dislike of this amp kit
1,Not even worth the money/probably not correct ratings,"I'm not impressed with Boss's stuff at all. The audio cable has the cheap plastic very thinly gold plated tip and wears out super fast even though it just sits there. The ends, don't even mess with them they are a waste of time and money and VERY cheaply made. This kit is cheaper than what you will probably find at your local stores but in this case you probably aren't even gettting what you paid for. The power/hot wire seems to be alright but with my other Boss equipment ( i bought an amp and this kit together) I'm not sure I'd trust the ratings. I'd look else where and took the time to write this review in hopes that you do."
1,seriously?,"Ok, we all want a good deal. but never again will i try to save a few bucks on this brand. I bought a boss amp and wiring kit. well, the amp worked for 2 days. and this kit(all boss stuff) is junk. i would not put a boss product anywhere without a fire extinguisher. i am not just whining because i got ripped off, i just want others to avoid costly mistakes. go to walmart and get scosche or dual, i did. no problems since."
4,good kit,good kit good price lots of pieces just what i needed for my install would definitely recommend worked very well
1,Bad wiring kit,"I won't buy again or recommend this product. The rca terminals were really cheap, they broke right off and speaker wire not all good either... If anything, just the remote and the 4 gauge power cable was the only thing that worked for me.. Everything else was like whatever. I resumed my installation by spare cables I had at home."
2,Terrible!,"There are only 2 decent things about this kit, the rca cables and the fuse. Everything else and i do mean everything else is garbage!-The power and ground wire is slightly SMALLER THAN 8 GAUGE!!!-The speaker cable is so bad.. i literally have no words to describe it, straight into the trash it went. (you can separate the left from right cables and use one side for your remote cable, but that's if your desperate)-The remote cable is about 5 strands of aluminum wire.... threw away along with the speaker wire.-The RCAs are not that bad-The smurf tubing is absolute garbage, toss it.-The ground cable is to short only 3'Please for the love of god dont buy this kit!! I have purchased in the past the Legacy 4 gauge kit on amazon its only 17$ and runs circles around this kit!!!!! save your money. I WILL POST PICTURES OF THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN REAL 4 GAUGE AND THIS 4 GAUGE!"
3,Decent for the money,"The product had sufficient wire length and everything needed to wire my 4 speakers, and amplifier. For the price it is a good buy. i just wish the RCA's were of better quality, from the outside they look great, but cut into them and you'll see how cheap they are. if you are using a lot of current through them, get new ones, the sound quality will be better i guarantee it. overall a great buy for the money!"
5,The Nugent Collection To Get,"Unless you already own all of his regular albums, this is a must for any Nuge fan. It has a good selection of songs, including essentials, live cuts, and a brand new song. All are good, although some are below average for Nugent, mainly some of the later songs on the album. However, it has pretty much all the songs you need, including unarguable rock anthems, Stranglehold and Cat Scratch Fever and several live cuts off the excellent Double Live Gonzo."
5,TERRIBLE TED,IVE BEEN A GREAT ADMIRER FO TED NUGENT AND HIS MUSIC SINCE I WAS 18 YEARS OLD...MY BESTFRIEND AND I USED TO LISTEN TO WANGO TANGO OVER AND OVER ON MY CAR STEREO TILL WE WORE THE DAMN THING OUT...I AM NOW 41 YEARS OLD AND STILL LSTEN TO HIS MUSIC AS MUCH AS I CAN...HES A GREAT MUSICIAN AND I CAN RELATE TO HIS ADVOCATING HUNTING BECAUSE EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY LOVES TO HUNT...IVE HAD A FEW STRUNG UP IN MY GARAGE.IN THE SMALL TOEN OF INDIANA THAT I LIVE IN... ATLEAST MY HOUSE GETS ROCKED...IF YOU GETTO READ THIS TED...KEEP UP THE GOOD LIFE...YOU CANT GRILL IT TILL YOU KILL IT...AND AS FOR YOUR ROCK..YOU CANT KILL IT TILL YOU GET YOUR FILL OF IT...LOVE YA...LET ME KNOW WHEN YOURE PLAYING IN THE AREA. BOY...I WISH MY BEST FRIEND WAS AROUND...I STILL HAVE MY ALBUM TOO...
1,You people are just cattle. You have no clue what music is!!,"You people here that think Ted Nugent is a great guitarist need to get the wax out of your ears.He had a few hits but mainly he's a crappy guitarist at best!!!You want to hear some GREAT guitar playing along with GREAT composition? Pickup any of cd's by these artists - Steve Morse, Allan Holdsworth, Eric Johnson, Scott Henderson, Kevin Gilbert, Dixie Dregs, Tribal Tech, Shawn Lane, Pat Metheny, Toy Matinee, Robben Ford, Frank Gambale, Yes, Genesis, Happy The Man, Chick Corea & The Electric Band, Steve Hackett, Toto, Steely Dan etc...Good Luck for those of you that want to learn what real music is!! Not that my list contains the only great music around. There's been plenty of great music around for hundreds of years."
1,Tired Clichés for old farts in trailer parks.,"This type of stuff gets old fast.Buy it suckers.OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the ""not helpful"" button, and the smart people can, at least, consider what I've written. Hardly and smart people here anyway."
3,Missing a few song I wanted,"I don't think that this is one of the better greatest hits CD out there cause it's missing a couple of radio staples like Great White Buffalo and Hey Baby but if you're a hardcore fan this this CD is for you, if you're a casual fan then I would start off with Out of Control or Ultimate Ted Nugent cause it has more material than this, overall I give this CD 3.5 stars."
3,Fun sloppy rock,"Ted Nugent / Great Gonzos...The best of Ted Nugent: Not a great album but a fun album for the most part, with a few old `70s radio nuggets. It's just ok...Three Stars."
2,"""Great Gonzos"" not so great.","After listening to all the tracks on this CD, it would have been nice to know that a few of them were live cuts and not recorded very well. Older high energy rock sounds better when recorded in a studio. As a mobile DJ sound quality is very important and this CD doesn't stack up as well as other Ted Nugent CDs."
2,Racist Tripe,"Oh, come on! Margaret Mitchell could not have done better in romanticizing the horrors of enslavement and decrying the promise of Reconstruction. Ms. Berlin's introduction seems oblivious to this."
1,Valley 53700 Deluxe Breakaway Kit,"This product is a major disappointment. The top of the battery box cracked during installation. The battery would not even light a 12 volt tail light bulb after being charged. The battery had to be replaced. The kit did not include the ""Deluxe Charger"" as advertised. On the positive side, the breakaway switch works."
3,Too Much Work,"It is a good product. I have no complaints about the functionality, but the assembly is a bear. It took at least 2 hours to assemble and mount the stand; I'm pretty efficient with a hammer, nail and ruler."
4,Shocking and surprising,"10.5 may be not scientifically correct (a 10.5 crumble ould only happen in a quake around the whole globe) but this movie keeps you glued to your seat, thanks to a good storyline and thwarting SFX.The acting is actually allright, compared to many other disaster-movies. It had great special effects, and a usual but interesting story.It's also a plus that the director, John Lafia, audiocomments on this film - and tells you certain tricks on how they performed some effects and stunts.So if you like disaster movies, this one is a good choice!"
3,THEYRSA WHOLE LOTTA SHAKIN GOIN ON,"I can't help it, I just cant. This movie is like a train wreck, you just help but watch it. Kim Delaney trying her best and delivering a sense of urgency to her role. Beau Bridges as the president trying to come across as tough but caring. The special effects are great, and the action is nonstop starting right from the beginning. Fun to watch, and yippee, a sequel is now at hand."
4,"A Little Cheesy, But Entertaining","Yes, 10.5 was a little over the top, but overall it was good.This movie has great special effects, no doubt about that, the acting was great, but the plot needed to be fine tuned.The Los Angeles collapse scene was pretty impressive as was the Golden Gate collapse scene.Overall, if you are looking for a disaster movie with great special effects, but a B rated script, 10.5 is your movie."
4,THE SHAKES,"A made for tv movie, 10.5 attempts to be the mother of all earthquake films, and on some levels, it succeeds. Even though many of the effects are obviously models, one can't deny the impact of seeing the Golden Gate Bridge and the Seattle Needle tumble to the ground. At nearly three hours long, it does have its draggy moments, and some of the dialogue is cliche and dull. However, if you take it for what it is, it far surpasses the theatrical EARTHQUAKE and isn't bad. Kim Delaney, Ivan Sergei, and Yvette Jackson do well in their roles. A lot of unknowns surfeit the cast, and some do well, others are merely bodies. John Schneider and his daughter's scenes are poorly executed, but the reunion with mother governor is touching. Veterans Beau Bridges and Fred Ward lend their solid support. The earthquakes themselves are devastating in their destruction and the end is a little far-fetched, but hey it's a movie, and for what I expected, it satisfied me."
3,Better than expected,"As far as disaster movies go, it was a little different from all the others. Wish it had been available for rental instead of purchase."
2,"Pathetic, simply pathetic","Where do you begin with this sorry excuse for a movie? The acting was poor, the special effects were at best marginal, and there were so many errors and inconsistencies that it was hard not to laugh at it.And a note for whomever wrote the movie, it's ""martial"" law, not ""marshal"" law."
1,ten point five spelled h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e,i'll take a page out of the director's book when he came up with the title for this film and give it a negative one on a one to ten scale. my ten year old nephew could have done better special effects and don't get me started on the acting or script. it's sad that i wasted a couple hours of my life (a couple hours i can never get back) watching this garbage; it should be banned from society.
4,10.5 Future,"I found this movie to be a well made tv movie of a sort of perdiction of the ""big Earthquake"" of California. It is very believable and that makes it scary. The vocabulary used and tracing the faults showed much looking into the probability of how it could happen. The connection with the families involvedwas extremely good and thought out.I would rhink that it would make people aware of the importance to have themselves ready for any earthquake. I say again, it is a very good TV. made movie and the writter should be commmended."
1,Didn't research the facts,"Okay, the biggest problem I had with this movie (besides the cheesy, over-the-top acting) was the fact that the movie makers didn't do their research. On top of getting the geological facts wrong, they also got any fact about Redding, Calf. wrong.First of all, there is no Mt. Retnault in Redding. They would either be at Mt. Shasta or Mt. Lassen. Second of all, Redding is a populated area. It's not even in the mountains. And third of all, if an earthquake that strong had hit Redding then Shasta Dam would have most likely exploded, and the entire region, from Redding to San Fransisco, would have been flooded out."
3,Visser,"I have wanted to read this book after I finished # something in Animorphs. I have heard great reviews about this book, but I don't think that is all cracked up to be. Sure it has a couple of good spots, but it gets boring after about the third page. U DO NOT have to read this book to finish the Animorph series. All the other books r awsome!"
5,Wow! KAA Another great book!,"KAA has written another great book! ""VIsser"" has a great plot, suspence and an exellent climax all rolled into one. Look, if you're having second thoughts about buying this book I'll tell you this: If you like the other books KAA has written you'll love this one."
3,Third Best,"I loved the other two chronicles books, but this one just wasn't up to the standard of the other two. It focused on Visser One, switching between her trial at the Council of Thirteen and her memories of finding Earth. as it was set amoung Earth and the human world, it wasn't as intresting as the other two, which were about Hork-Bajir and Andalites. The bits with the Council of thirteen, in my opinion were better then the rest of the story as I'd been wondering about this for ages. It was O.K, but had nothing special about it, no revelations like The andalite Chronicles or moral issues like The Hork-Bajir Chroncicles. If you're a big Animorphs fan, get this, though you'll probably only read it once or twice- which makes it annoying it's a hardback as my copy of the Andalite Chronicles is falling apart- I'd rather that had been a hardback. Though the holographic cover is cool."
5,A Spectacular Book,"This Book is a deep, engaging look into the Yeerk mind. In Visser, You're not sure who to root for since the main charcters are Vissers One and Three. About mid-way through the book, the Animorhs appear as seen at the end of #35, but they aren't the real heroes and you're never really hoping for them to stick around. The dark gloomness helps set the general mood for the book, but the end isn't for the happily ever after people."
4,Great book to read,"Do you you like to read books that are out of this world, because if you do this book is good for you.I give Animorphs ""Visser"" Four stars because I think it's a reallt good book,but not the best.This book is about an alien that's at the highest rank Visser One. These aliens are called Yeerks. Yeerks go into peoples brains and over controls them.Well Visser one is on trail and he doesn't want to be found gulity. Visser three on the other hand want's him the be found gulity. Soon Visser One's only hope to live is to call his host's son Marco for help.If you really like books that do with aliens try reading this book."
4,A good book.......,This book tells you a lot about the yeerk society and the past about Visser one.it is a good book.It also tells you how Visser one started the sharing and more. It is a must read!
4,Animorphs: Visser book review,"Animorphs: Visser is about the ""dark side"" of the andalite series. There's this Yeerk named Edriss 652 that has become visser one and she's on trial with visser 3. Visser 3 has the only andalite host and visser1 discovered the only class-5 species, to state the ""good"" about them.The book was fine. I, personally really liked this book - but not as much as the hork-bajir chronicles.I give it 4/5 stars."
4,"Excellent, but somewhat lacks what the other Chronicles had","VISSER is the newest entry in the ""Chronicle Series"". The book was excellent. K.A. is truly talented; her use of words are excellent. Although the book plot was far from what I had in mind (I thought VISSER ONE was going to be utterly and truly evil, which would be great to see - a book totally narrated by a bad guy/girl), we have a very different Visser than what we had in mind. For those of you that think that you will learn all about life with Marco before she dissapeared, you are SO wrong. There's hardly ANYTHING about that, which was also a bit sad. BUT, the truly AWESOME thing about this book is that we finally meet the COUNCIL OF THIRTEEN. I had been waiting for a story about them for a while, and finally we get to see what they are like. And you will not be dissappointed at all. This book is defenitely one to add to your collection. VISSER is a must have."
2,Get one with brass zipper,Nylon zipper failed with light use. The old fashioned heavy brass zipper matches the old fashioned canvas bag. I've replaced this with similar bag (brass zipper). Very handy for carrying or stashing a few tools under the seat.
4,Very nice little bag.,Just what I was looking for. Kind of like what NASA use to give out to the technicians for their tools. Nothing fancy just a good quality bag.
5,Great little bag!,Exactly what I was looking for - perfect size and good construction. Price was really competitive. I would recommend this product.
2,Quality is great! Didn't realize just how small this bag really was,"The quality any stitching of the bag is very nice. However the bag is so much smaller than I had anticipated. Another concern is the side pouches DO NOT SNAP. So if you have small tools (precision screwdriver, etc.) to place in this bag, I recommend NOT putting them in the side pouches. You could lose them quite easily."
5,Well made and durable quality,"I bought this bag to toss in the back of our SUV -- to keep a few tools, tow rope, small folding shovel. The size was perfect -- not bulky and large, but just right to tuck away in the back and not take up a lot of room. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the canvas and the zipper. I ended up ordering a second one to give as a gift."
4,G.I. Style O.D. Mechanics Tool Bag,Tool bag works well. I like the bag but I didn't like paying the same mount for the shipping and handling rip-off.
5,got space?,this bag with the heavy duty brass zipper is perfect for stuffing with just about anything that you can put into itI'm getting more when I can
4,A good buy,"Very good - sturdily made and compact, yet roomy enough for its intended use. I bought it to store emergency tools in a small bin under the floor of an SUV."
3,Good but not great,"It's a great concert, not the greatest sound but an excellent HD quality video though. I Love Paramore and I really hope they release a new concert in blu-ray..."
3,Entertaining Concert,"I am more into heavier stuff but I gambled and got this bd anyway. Sound and video quality were good. Performance was good. Songs were good (song types vary from pop to pop rock to rock ska, etc.) and very diverse."
3,Great for first time Blu-Ray,"Someone in the reviews mentioned if I love Twilight, I must love this. Ok, I hate all Twilight but I really enjoyed this Blu-Ray. I wanted it to be a little longer, but that's okay, I know it's only the Riot! album they did. I think it's fun, great for background tv, and I've had it on when people are over and they loved it, too. The quality is great, the sound is amazing, and Haley's voice sound just right- not overly produced or tweaked in this dvd."
5,Paramore Rocks! A++++,"Paramore's The Final RIOT! rocks Chicago with a killer 15 song set. The contagious energy is electric - the amazing 1080p video quality and Dolby TrueHD create an ""as-if-you-were-there"" experience. The special features include a Paramore documentary that is fun, quirky, and gives an insider's perspective to life on the road with Paramore. As a TWILIGHT FAN, I am stoked to have bonus Twilight soundtrack clips with unbelievable audio. ""The Decode"" music video plays back in 720p and ""I Caught Myself"" audio is featured in Dolby TrueHD. This Blu-ray rocks! A+."
3,Motion sensor not the best but it is still a nice decorative piece,I tested this out in a pitch black room and had trouble working.It worked ok in dimly lit room. I guess the motion sensor works better during day. It is fun overall and a nice piece to decorate a wall. Kids will have lots of fun with it if it and when it works.
3,Not what I expected,"Another Christmas movie had made a cute reference to this movie, so I decided to get it for my daughter. It really wasn't a good movie and my daughter only half enjoyed it. The product arrived on time and in great condition, so no slight on the provider. It's just not worth the time to watch it!"
5,My kids love it!!,We watch it over and over and over...of course my kids are three and four years old...but it is cute
2,Taser gun not necessary.,"We watched this with our kids one evening. It was a decent movie, certainly not the high quality of the christmas classics. When Eubie the elf went down to help the small town get off the naughty list, the Santa security team arrives to take him back to the north pole, not with a net, or a bag but with a TASER GUN. They shocked him with it, or so you assume because they show him blacking out after they ""Zap"" it into the air. It was not the type of thing I had expected to have to explain to my young kids while watching a christmas cartoon about a happy elf. It was in very bad taste."
1,Not a Christmas classic... wish I didn't own it :(,"This movie is really not that great. It's not awful, but it's just not great. It definitely does not give you that warm, magical Christmas feeling. The attitude and words coming from the kids' mouths is not very little kid friendly. I promise you you'll be happier if you buy a different Christmas cartoon."
1,More than I can stand,"I am ten years old and this movie might be fun for toddlers (ages 2-4) but I did not like it. It is short, quite strange, and whenever I watch it I run to my room and slam the door. I cannot stand this movie. The best part of this movie is that when you touch a certain place on the case, it (the case) lights up and sings. When my mom bought it, it was rated four and a half stars, but it was quite a dissapointment. If you want to watch the worst movie ever, buy this item!"
5,Cute Little Movie,"This movie is in great condition and so much fun to watch. My kids have watched it over and over. I'm going to have to buy another one to keep in my classroom because my students love the movie, too!"
1,Didn't realize this was in Italian....,"My rating is only low because I got a dvd that was in italian and not in english. I would rate the move as ""5 Starrs."" I guess I didn't look closely enough at the description because this dvd arrived from Italy and was in Italian. I can't play it on our dvd player so it's a waste for us. I love the movie and was ordering it for my sister-in-law because she love Harry Connick Jr. I had to reorder the dvd for her.Learned my lesson to read the fine print a bit better."
3,Not what I expected...,"I was not impressed by this book. I read this author's previous book ""One Woman Short"" and enjoyed it, this current book left me feeling oh well.I was intrigued by the excerpt, but wasn't excited by the content. I expected a different connection between the books characters. I figured out the connection of the characters early and somehow lost my enthusiasm for the story. It was good in that it explored the world of cyberspace and the willingness in which people will freely express things over that medium.The erotic nature of the book kept me interested however, the scenes were often a laugh or a bit too strange for my tastes. The characters came across as unrealistic in certain instances.It was not the worst book I've read, but it's not a book that I'll recommend to anyone."
2,I didn't like it,i would not read another nelson george book unless someone told me that it was really good. i wasn't too enthused about this one. it was a quick easy read but i was not drawn to the pages.
2,Huh?!?!? Did I miss something?,"What started out as an interesting story about people testing their sexual boundaries turned into a contrived mess by the end. Yes, the story has twists and turns, but I did not understand any of the characters' motivations for doing any of the freaky things they enjoyed doing. Midway through the book everything stopped making sense. The only thing this book can offer is titillation, but if you are looking for more, look elsewhere."
4,Ben Sidran CD,"I have been looking this CD for awhile now, and It arrived sooner than It informed me.Great service and I will use it again when needed."
2,Earls review,Low end jazz a wonderful cd for those with very basic and uninformed ear. Simplistic and sutle.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"The first peg fell off less than a month after purchasing it... it was April, so you can imagine there were not too many coats on it. Don't waste your time with any of these similar coat racks, go for a metal one."
3,"Nice looking, but broke few months after purchase","Nice looking and the quality is better than I expected.But the holes made for the assembly at the bottom were not deep enough and I accidentally cracked the wood a little while trying to screw it in tight . I thought it was ok as it is, but the whole thing collapsed on me yesterday...Be gentle with it while assembling and you will enjoy this rack for a long time."
3,Average quality item,"The product I ordered is of average quality, it came damaged, but when contacted the company sent out a replacement part very swiftly, so I would rate the customer service as excellent, the qaulity of the product was, however, not what I expected."
2,Not so good,"If you are planning on hanging anything with weight, like a winter coat or two, this is not the rack for you. ""Wood"" splits and the whole thing just falls apart....."
1,"After 7 months, it broke.","If you have a few - three or four coats/jackets - to hangup on this coat rack, then buy metal and not wood. This wood coat rack did not stand the test of time. I bought in December and it broke in July."
3,Nice piece for the $$$,The first one of these broke one day due to the amount of clothes I had hanging on it. Was so handy and a good match for my cherry bedroom suite that I bought a second one and put the broken one in the garage for jackets.
5,A Favorite,My Triplet 2 year olds have been watching this video for almost a year. They always enjoy seeing it. The muppet characters are fun and the music is pleasant for all of us. The video is very high quality-- bright and colorful and somewhat similar to the Baby Einstein series. It makes me feel good to give them something educational as well as entertaining!
4,The agita of adolescence,"The journey begins with a boy who knows he's different but has been brandished with labels like ""wimp"" not only by his peers but also by his father. His physicality is not of the jock persuasion but his intellect is keen.This quick read takes you through the daily abuses he endures and accepts - it is a study in high school socialization on steriods.As the reader, we feel the pain he feels especially when he connects emotionally with someone else who has been branded as a loner. Their relationship culminates in the liberation of their abuse through retaliation.Joseph Suglia is brilliant at bringing thoughts and feelings to life through vivid visualizations. One of the signatures of his writing style are his quotable quotes like ""I am a gay boy exclusively attracted to girls"" and ""I am not a human being anymore. I am meat and gristle, bone and sinew, skin and tissue.""This is not a feel-good coming of age novel. It is honest disclosure of adolescent angst and loneliness."
1,Why Joe? Why?,"Your embarrassing you and your family.You underestimate your writing ability by minimize your writing talent when you resort to this so-called ""controversy"". Is the fat lady in the circus ""controversial"" or do people only look and gather because she is making a spectacle of herself? Anyone with a low level of embarrassment or delusional, like you, could write this type of book.If you tried hard enough you could write a book that was good on it's own merit, not because of eroticism, vulgarity or immaturity.So you should like this ... is it ""controversial"" enough or should I pretend I'm masterbating when I write it?"
5,Rage..,"""Years Of Rage"" is a quick trip into the life of a boy who is relentlessly tormented both by his peers and his family.What an assault! It grabs you by the collar with the very first line and refuses to let go until you turn the last page disheartened that the adventure, albeit a grisly one, has come to an end. The story is fast paced and the characters are unforgettable.Suglia, whose writing is always magnificently quotable, delivers many lines that whether they evoke laughter or shudders are perfect for putting into your pocket to enjoy again later.The author is of the kind that whether you enjoy the actual story he tells or not you cannot help but be fascinated with how well it's told. I greatly anticipate all future offerings.Excellent read."
2,Trying too hard,"The story is way over the top and very difficult to believe. I understand that kids that are bullied are often afraid to report the abuse but come on, if you are constantly having feces smashed in your hair or being urinated on wouldn't you tell someone. I guess I get what the author was trying to accomplish by showing the extreme case of high school abuse, but it really was to much to swallow. The style that the book was written in was different as well and I didn't really enjoy it either. I was looking for an interesting character study and I didn't really find what I was looking for with this book."
1,Inexpensive quality and okay colors,"First what is fine: Realizing monitors are different, the color was okay. Color ordered was slightly darker than normal colonial blue-gray. Flowers are dark gold, two shades of blue-gray and a very black-navy outlining around some flowers and leaves. There is no pink in the flowers. The white portion is a ""dirty' ivory,Quality: LOW! It resembles that fuzzy, cheap 'carpet' in your low-budget automobiles. It is machine woven in Turkey. There are a thin amount of fibers and they lay flat; very little density. The design almost looks like it was printed on, but is woven.Due to fiber type and possibly construction, every cat hair and lint piece ""sticks"" to the surface. Running the vacuum over and over is no help. It is like they get entangled into the surface fibers.Shipping was quick. Packaging was fine."
2,"Kinda pretty, but LOW quality","First colors: They are fine. Realizing monitors are different. The color is a dark hunter green, with black outlining around flowers and leaves. Flowers are dark gold, burgundy (not cranberry), and some teal blue. Very, very little pink is noticeable in some of the flowers. The white portion is an ivory, but next to the dark green it seems a brighter white.Quality: LOW! It resembles that fuzzy, cheap 'carpet' in your low-budget automobiles. It is machine woven in Turkey. The rug has a thin amount of fibers and they lay flat. It almost looks like it is surfaced printed, but is not.Due to fiber type and possibly construction, every cat hair and lint piece ""sticks"" to the surface. Running the vaccuum over and over is no help. It is like they get entangled into the surface fibers.Shipping was quick. Packaging was fine."
1,Kindle version almost illegible,"I was eager to read this book, and despite some of the other comments, the introduction suggested the book would be reasonably fair even if somewhat biased. But the Kindle version is distractingly fragmented, with misprints everywhere. Avoid."
5,A Celebration of the Celebration!,"If you grew up Italian or another European ethnic, this will bring back great memories and you will become teary eyed as you remember those amazing immigrants, our Grandparents. The story is a realistic observation of the family celebration and the recipes are as authentic as you'll find for the traditional Italian Christmas Eve Feast. Those Italians never measured anything, they just put enough in until it feels right. You will see that the Tinnells put enough love into this book and it feels just right."
4,A delicious book,"I followed the Christmas adventures of this funny family every day as it ran as an online strip and devoured them delightedly. But what a joy it was to read again in one book. Those folks had been familiar first time through; now they truly felt like family. The story tells of an ethnic family (like all ethnic families) where love, respect and tradition clump together like ingredients in a soup, often delicious, always sloppy. The recipes look good, too. I bought a couple to give away as Christmas presents, but now I have to keep one for myself and now I'm going to buy a few more to spread around with holiday cheer."
5,My son's favourite,"I bought one for my son two years back and that's the only toy that is to this day his favourite . He just loves to carry the pup around everywhere, and when we had gone abroad sure enough the grey pup went along too. It's beautifully soft and silky and I have washed it so many times but it's coat is still good as new. These animal alley soft toys are a must have for kids. Highly durable and affordable. One toy I'm happy I bought it."
4,"Hot, Cold, and, On Fire!",The CD is pretty good with the exception of the Sporty Thieves song. I like the way the Cd takes you through the movie. For those who haven't seen the movie watch it before you listen to the Cd. Not only is the Cd completely parallel to the movie but the CD can't be truly appreciated until you know the full story line. I love the duet between Beyonce' and Marc Nelson. It illustrates what good music should sound like. Their voices combine for beautiful harmony.
4,Stevie Wonder Song,"It isn't on the soundtrack. It's called ""As Always."" Great song that should have been included."
4,birthday party song,"could anyone tell me the name of the song which was played at the birthday party,cuz it wasn't included in the sound track."
4,Above average soundtrack,"The soundtrack is an above average soundtrack with different flavors for different people. My favorites on the cd include the cut by the Roots, After All Is Said and Done by Beyonce and Marc Nelson, Beautiful Girl by Kenny Lattimore and As My Girl by Maxwell. The main reason to buy the cd however is for POETRY GIRL BY ERIC BENET and LIAR, LIAR BY LATOCHA SCOTT- THE GIRL IS HOT!. I love Maxwell, but Let's Not Play the Game is overrated as is the Lauryn Hill song and the cut with Ginuwine, RL etc. As for the people complaining about the song AS not being on the cd, GET OVER IT! The song was originally released over 23 years ago and is played on oldies stations all across the country! Where have you been? Don't cry about the cut not being on the cd - BUY SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE BY STEVIE WONDER AND ENJOY THE ENTIRE CD! It's a masterpiece and you won't be sorry."
1,never received!!!,even though i received a refund for this item its a shame it never came because it makes me suspicious that the sender may have never sent it!!!
5,Question,what is the name of that song they play during the reception ..when they were doing that dance ..please help
3,great movie- sound track cd - missing key song,"I loved the movie- but I was disapointed in the cd- It's missing a key song- AS (Stevie Wonder-Songs in the key of life)I felt the song should have been included in the soundtrack, but I am not disapointed. Enjoy!"
4,stevie's song??,"i hope that you guys can help me out! i love the stevie wonder song in the movie! i dont know the name! i was hoping it was on the cd but no luck! please, i really have to have this song! if some one can tell me the name or what cd to buy. i would appericate it."
1,missing songs!,why would I buy this most of the songs I want to hear aren't on it - not everyone goes for sappy mediocre R&B wannabe love songs! NO STARS AVAILABLE FROM ME
3,Missing my favorite song!,"I was wondering, does anyone know who sings the ""Candy"" song that plays while the stripper dances at the bachelor party? It's the same song that the cast dances the electric slide to at the end of the film. It was my favorite track in the entire film, and it's not on the soundtrack. Help!"
5,tottaly awesome,"the best song on this release is ""liar liar"" by latocha scott, i don't think that I could live without it."
1,Awful mix,"This soundtrack was bad. The songs and the mix of artists was not effective. Seems like it was all thrown together at the last minute. The only good song is Kenny Lattimore's smooth Beautiful Girl. Particular disappointment goes out to Maxwell with his two tired, full of fluff songs. Pass on this CD or dub it from a friend. Spend your dollars on Amel or something else"
3,"Not bad, but too much fat","Well, the songs I really wanted to hear on this album are absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs are just a lot of mainstream R&B junk that get boring at times.The outstanding tracks on the album are those by The Roots, Maxwell (both tracks are awesome), Me'Shell and Lauryn Hill. I was pleasantly surprised by Eric Benet & Faith Evans' tracks.Unfortunately, the rest I find very boring and they sound like the rest of R&B on the radio. In fact, the title track, The Best Man I Can Be (by Genuwine, Case, R.L. and Tyrese) is down-right corny. Four guys singing a love song to one another? Damn... that's weak.But, the strong songs definitely make up for this album. The Roots and Maxwell alone are worth the price of the CD!"
3,Great album....but.....,"I liked the album in general. With the Hill and Marley song by itself it is worth it. However, I believe that this CD is misleading. The one song I purchased the song for wasn't even included on the CD. This is the song you heard during all the previews of the movie. I'm sure I'm not the only person who bought this CD hoping that song was going to be on there. To no avail. Such a shame, it sounded like a great song. maxwell's tune deserves an honourable mention."
3,OK but...,"The CD overall was good but I am a little disappointed with one aspect of it.I bought The Best Man CD thinking AS would be on it. It was in the movie and on the commercial for the movie, but not on the CD. The producers of this CD could have mentioned somewhere in the CD jacket where you could purchase AS, but since they didn't, I will.The original: Recorded by Stevie Wonder Songs in the Key of Life.The remake: Recorded by George Michael & Mary J. Blige AS. Can be purchased as a CD single. It has to be imported. Not available in the United States.None-the-less, the movie was EXCELLENT!Faith: Your song on the CD is a little daring in light of what has happened in the past, but I ain't mad at cha. In fact, it is -one- of the best songs on the whole CD."
3,Missing Stevie Wonder tune!,"I just bought the CD hoping to get that Stevie Wonder tune that the Best Man and Nia Long danced too in the flashback he had in the movie. But it's missing! Does anyone know what that song was called? I thought it was ""Always"" - but I can't find such a Stevie Wonder tune - and yet, the song they play on radio ads (Stevie Wonder's) is not on the soundtrack!! That's the disapointment to an otherwise well done CD..."
2,Disappointing,"For the most part it's the same old tired RNB even with artists who usually put out quality music. Surprisingly, even Maxwell's songs were useless. Advice: Borrow this from someone who thinks this CD is great and dub the songs you like. But beware....."
5,Very Good,"My favorite on this album is ""Turn Yur Lights Down Low"". Wonderful! This album is truly great, and very soulful. I like it very much, and would recommend it to anyone."
2,Dated for a 2005 edition,The text is quite dated for a 2005 edition. All of the citations are over 5 years old. The material is written at highly advanced economics level and may not be appropriate as a multi-disciplinary text.
1,Don't Bother,"Mr. Clayton obviously knows what he's talking about; the user will not. IF the CD is organized at all, it should really be accompanied by a companion CD of tutorials that will explain the methodology of that organization. The tutorials are abstruse and require more time to decipher than the program should to learn. I bought Mr. Clayton's CD by accident (I meant to buy a different one), but even if I had intended to buy his, doing so would have been a mistake. (One star by duress)"
2,Hardly a classic,"The singer has a fine voice but there is little else favourable about this recording. As with many Naxos recordings they sacrifice quality in favour of price. Yes people want to be able to buy budget CDs, but not when they are of such a poor standard. As someone who speaks German I was appalled by the pronounication and general diction. It is a great shame that Naxos cannot find consistency, given that there have been many fine CDs, like Handel's Messiah and the Bax Symphonies. Try again Naxos!"
3,"For for the square-sized laptops, not for rectangular","If you are looking for a PC laptop sleeve, this is correct, however if you are looking for one for a Macbook Pro, you may want to search elsewhere, unless you don't mind the extra height.This is a great case, don't get me wrong and the pocket is pretty awesome. But all the same, this unit is not really meant for Macbook Pro's. A macbook is more rectangular, this is more for the larger PC styled laptops that are taller in height as they are with Width. I believe Mobile Edge also has a special ""Macbook Pro"" design.Just make sure before you purchase to check your specs on width/height ratios. :)"
3,Fine except for the tempi,"The chorus and orchestra sound fine. The only problem I have with this recording is that most of the tempi are excruciatingly slow and the interpretation too refined. Other reviewers have pointed out the spirituality of this recording. I am of the school that the composer's intentions are more important than the conductor's. The Requiem has many contemplative moments, but foremost it is a work of bombast and contrasts, and it is these contrasts that make the spiritual moments more exciting. Those contrasts were missing, and for that reason the interpretation was on the blah side. Ironically, the only part of this recording that was not too slow was the Lacrymosa, and that seemed too fast."
5,A Very Fine Compilation,"""The Essential Falla"" is just that, including all of Manuel de Falla's major works (performed by the likes of Dutoit, Fruhbeck de Burgos and de Larrocha) on these two CDs. Highlights are excellent performances of Falla's three most famous works: ""El amor brujo"", ""Noches en los jardines de Espana"" and ""El Sombrero de tres picos"". The rest of the included music is perhaps less well-know but no less enjoyable. Perhaps the only quibble I have with this CD is the enclusion of the Harpsicord Concerto. While it is an enjoyable piece, it is very much a Stravinsky-esque neo-classical work, and it seems somewhat out of place amongst Falla's other, very Spanish, works. Nonetheless, if you enjoy 20th Century Spanish music, this CD is indeed an essential."
4,This movie is AMAZING!,"What else can I say? This is truly a one-of-a-kind movie...It's one of those movies where, right after you see it, you end-up showing it to as many people as possible... it's so outragous and just downright fun.The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras (hence the four-star rating), but hey-- the exploding heads are clearer than ever...!"
4,Fake Blood at it's Best.,"Does the sight of an exploding head make you laugh or cry? Would you be upset if a character who's arm is cut ties his own ligaments together? Does a villian chopping a guys face in half upset you? Well...I don't want to give too much away. I suppose there is a plot in this movie somewhere. I think Riki's girlfriend is killed by prison herion dealers, I think. It's not really important. A true splatterfest for the whole family to enjoy."
4,Awesomely bad.,"Loved it! Awesomely bad movie! The movie is alittle slow but has great cheesy fight scenes through out. This is a great ""B movie"". If you like poor and goofy special effects then you'll like this movie. I would not recommend this movie if you are looking for a skillful martial arts exhibition."
5,what a cool movie.,what can i say. this is just a really cool movie. a really violent cool movie. a senselessly violent cool movie. buy it.
4,Two severed thumbs up,"A friend showed me this movie and after seeing it, i knew i had to add it to my collection. I always wished someone would make a live action ninja scroll, and this is the closest i have seen(Minus the monsters). Well, i guess there is one ""monster"" in the movie and it could have been done better. But, hey if you dig horror and kung-fu, you should check it out. I don't think you have to be really into either genre(horror/kung-fu) to fully enjoy this movie, Just dig alot of action in your movies,Oh and blood and guts. Hey, i have a pretty good dvd collection and some of my movies are great and some most people wouldn't waste their time with, but i've played this movie for alot of my friends and we all had a good time watching it. Maybe it was all the alcohol and whatever, but riki-oh is a cool movie and should be in every <film> lovers collection."
2,NOT A KUNG FU MOVIE!,"When you get thru watching this movie, you will say it was the stupidest movie ever. First I wanna say, this is not a kung fu flick. It has absolutely nothing to do with martial arts. I don't know what to call it, but drink a few beers and watch it with your friends and the movie will be entertaining. Its actually pretty funny. At the end, Rikki Oh fights the chinese version of the incredible hulk or something. Don't buy it if you're starting a kung fu collection. Its more of a funny-horror type movie."
1,Riki-Oh I just wasted 25 bucks!,"I had high hopes for this film--based on the reviews I read here. I'm a big fan of kung-fu and silly horror films like Evil Dead. I thought this movie would be the best of both worlds. WRONG! This is not a kung-fu movie, it's just a gore film. The ""fight"" scenes don't even last 30 seconds. Riki simply makes one attack and punches through the bad guys' chest or head. Buy this only if you're a fan of Dead Alive, not if you're into kung-fu."
2,Asian attempt at Troma type entertainment.,I enjoy the genre of over the top gore comedy but this one didn't interest me. The story was very slow paced and uninteresting with some pretty unimaginative gore.It was also ridiculous and not in a comedic way but a 'that is stupid' way. People are smashing through stone walls a lot.The final 'ultra' gory finale really didn't interest me either.Watch Troma's Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie if you enjoy this type of movie. Or wait for Poultrygeist which will probably be pretty Tromariffic.I don't know when this was made but I would guess it has to be inspired by Troma. I appreciate the effort but it didn't match let alone surpass Troma for gore comedy.
1,Gory fighting and that is it...,"Story of Ricky is set in the near future when prisons are run like franchised companies. The main character, Riki, is sent to one of these prisons where his superior martial arts skills help keep him alive as he finds out that the prison is run by a corrupt warden and four powerful prisoners. Story of Ricky is a carnival of gore and martial arts which often becomes nauseating. The story is not the main event in this film, but rather the ultra violence is what keeps the audience's attention. There is a feeble attempt to display Riki's sensitive side, however, this becomes abundantly awkward. In addition, the poor cinematography, mise-en-scene, sound, acting, voice over, and music makes this a terrible cinematic experience."
4,Fun-filled Martial Arts Mayhem!,"Great stuff! I don't recommend this film as much for the ""gore"" aspect that many folks love to point out, but for it's consistent ""anti-institution"" thematics. Nice acting for such a fantastical film while some downright hilarious and over-exaggerated physical expressions allow the viewer to follow along in the fun as well as balancing the serious with the humorous.""Riki-Oh"" plays more like a graphic sci-fi Anime film, without the gratuitous nudity and sexual situations. I was initially mislead into believing this was a comedic romp, but the comedy is more subtle than stated in other reviews."
2,A let-down.......,"I had been hearing about this movie for years. I am a big fan of Hong Kong cinema, ""wire-fu,"" zombie movies, and cheesy horror movies like ""Dead Alive.""Upon mentioning ""Dead Alive"" to people, many mentioned this movies, saying that I HAD to see it and that it was SO funny and SO gorey.I finally broke down and bought it and watched it yesterday. The dubbing was great, the voices and some of the lines were hilarious; but it didn't make up for what the movie lacked.....The gore was a bit silly, but not so over-the-top as I had expected.Overall, I was dissapointed and would recommend VIEWING this movie, but not OWNING it."
2,Give me a break,"I guess I was expecting more from this movie considering all the hype I've heard about it. But this movie just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, it was good for a laugh or two but as far as the quality of the movie-it was completely horrible. The special effects looked like they went out and bought some fake body parts from a costume and joke shop, then picked up a few cans of chung-king and there you have it. None of the gore was even remotely realistic. This movie does not even come close in quality of gore or movie making in general to that of DeadAlive, Re-Animator or even Zombie for that matter. I guess Rikki-Oh is a movie you would have to see to believe, but I would see if a friend has a copy or try renting it before you buy. I paid $30 dollars for mine and felt like kicking myself after I saw the movie. It is now just a novelty item in my collection."
2,"Gore, gore, and more gore","Save your money unless your just want something to watch to kill some time. The martial art action scenes where not that great (but they were gory), and the story is very weak. Just don't do it!"
2,Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky,"I was dissapointed with this movie.I heard a lot about it,and my expectations were pretty high.Too bad.It has gore and nothing more.Story is stupid,villians funny,fights short.And how do you like Yukari Oshima as a man? Someone told me it is a good comicsadaptation.It's not.If you are hardcore martial-arts fan it wortha look.Deside for yourself.Tattooed killer sitting on the top of a cross is great!"
5,One of the greatest movies........ever,You know a movie is good when everybody you know keeps trying to steal it from you just to brag that its theirs. Ive watched this many of times with many different people and they all just sit speechless throughout the movie till its over. Then they say that was the stupidest movie Ive ever seen....But the next weekend they come back to me wanting to see it again. Its an excellent movie to watch while consuming alchohol and its hard to stop watching it once you start cause you just want to see whats going to happen next.
5,Got Blood?,"Do you like martial arts? Do you like gore? Do you like campy, trash videos? If you said yes to any of the above questions, then The Story of Ricky is definitely for you. What can I possibly say about a movie that has been voted #1 by all stoners as the greatest movie ever to watch while high. Nam Nai Choi proves that you do not need any computers to create the greatest and most hilarious gore scenes ever to grace celluloid. The Story of Ricky is the average tale of one strong, noble man that has the courage to stand up to the evil, and oppressive authority. In this case the strong man happens to be an invincible prisoner named Ricky, and the cruel authoritarians happen to be super powered thugs and prison officials. The Story of Ricky is definitely one to add to the collection."
5,quality product,"Besides the quality(nice gauge, excellent chrome), a real surprise was the chrome-look spindle. That piece looks really surprisingly GREAT and adds so much to the look of such a utilitarian bathroom fixture. Very easy to install for a mildly accomplished DIYer."
3,All part NOT included for mounting,"My holder also did not arrive with any kind of mounting bracket, just two screws.If you are replacing a holder and have a cavity in your wall it is nearly impossible to insert a mounting board into the wall that is already covered with sheet rock.Would have ordered a different product had I known this was not the complete package."
3,Beware of the limitations of the clamp,"As was suggested, I ordered this item with the 588 clamp. For starters, neither the holder nor the clamp come with hardware that will hold the clamp in place -- the supplied screws simply slip through the slots in the clamp, which makes it less than clampy. Trying to figure out a replacement was a little tricky, as the pre-drilled slots meant that not just any screw would grab the clamp, and that getting the clamp into the wall without dropping it behind the drywall would be tricky. In my case, as I was patching a new panel in the bathroom wall, I ended up pulling off the panel and assembling the paper holder and bracket in place around the new piece of drywall, then re-mounting the entire thing. I used some fairly wide-thread #8 screws that went into a bat-wing style drywall anchor, which got enough grip against the back of the bracket to work. This means I have to be very careful loosening the assembly for painting, but it seemed to be the only solution."
2,not for high school,"So far, this book has not been worth the money for highschool theater class. It has lots of foul language and subjects that are not at all fit for a high school. The only one that is really likable is the one on China Town and Misreadings. Tape was interesting, but not high on the dramatic scale."
1,No Go for USA,The CD was burned for Japanese language users and all packaging is in Japanese. It wouldn't rip to my MP3 player either.I sent it back since English is my only language.
1,Worst pots and pans I have owned.,"Cooking with these pots is difficult since everything sticks to it--even while you are trying to cook. Cleanup requires scraping the food from the bottom to get it clean. Then, a white discoloration begins on the inside of the pots. The instructions say to use denture cleaner to remove. I tryed everything and it did not budge. Instead, the texture of the inside enamel is no longer smooth but rough. They look so bad that I am embarrassed to use them in front of guests. I thought I was buying nice cookware that would last for a long time. Instead, I am now looking at cheaper cookware that I won't mind throwing out when it starts looking bad."
4,Perfect!,Excellent muffin pan. The non-stick is fantastic if you don't want to use muffin cups. Just a light spray of cooking oil and you're good to go. This muffin pan will make those jumbo muffins that you see sold in a Starbucks or a Dunkin Donuts. Great pan for great food.
3,It's okay.,I purchased this to make individual upside down pineapple cakes. I was hoping the muffin holes were a little larger (wider).
4,Great Jumbo Muffin Pan(s),I am very pleased with the quality of the Wilton 6-Cup Jumbo Muffin Pan. This bakeware is medium weight and seems to be insulated. I purchased two pans to save time making several muffins. The local Walmart usually carries Wilton Bakeware but they did not have any jumbo pans in stock at the time I needed them. I would recommend these to anyone.
3,Arrived dented,"This muffin pan was dented when I removed it from Amazon's shipping box. I'm not returning it because I need to use it right away and because the dent is along one edge, not in one of the muffin cups. But I don't think Amazon should ship products that are damaged. I'm fairly sure the damage occurred before the item was shipped, as there were protective air pillows above the area where the dent is. An Amazon employee placing the muffin tin in the shipping box could not have missed seeing the dent, as he or she placed the air pillows directly on top of it."
5,yummy,"The big muffins are really a hit in our home. These pans cook so well, don't stick, and make beautiful muffns... will be making a special recips with them for Christmas breakfast"
5,meal in a muffin,I received these as a gift for Christmas and loved them had to buy more. I have two grown boys and this muffin pan makes the right size muffins for their large appetites.
2,Who is this book written for?,"As a structural engineer, the only type of person who should be allowed to design significant sign structures, I find the book very disappointing. It explains concepts like bending moment and torsion that a fisrt-year engineering student should know, except that any student will tell you it's wrong to say ""torsion is a form of shear"". The book deals with a subject of interest to practicing engineers (not to students) but as though they know nothing.It is aimed at a non-existing market segment. Dangerously, it does not deal with subjects like metal fatigue."
3,Better than you'd think,"Given the smarmy product description, tacky cover, and a 5 star review by someone who rates it for work-outs you'd be forgiven for thinking this is another uninspiring Tong-clips-the-ticket album.Disc 1 is crap. It's flat pedestrian house that probably won't get a second spin in your player unless you're a masochist.Disc 2 is a sensational down-beat album however - Knuddelmaus by Ulrich Schnauss drifts into 8Ball by Underworld and there are a string of great tracks. Tong's style of mixing actually suits these tracks which don't really need to take energy from each other, and he gives a warm emotional tone to much of the album. There are some difficult tracks which jar a bit but they don't ruin the flow.If you find this one in a bargain bin definitely grab it for disc 2."
4,Standing in Good Graces,"After listening to this CD several times I still find it very exhilerating to hear Martha Davis sing live. The pluses on this disc are that the biggest hits are here (except for Total Control) and that they sound great. The minuses are that there are only 10 songs and The Motels new material is nowhere to be seen. I was at this live performance when it was recorded and the songs that are missing are some of the bands' best and most moving to date.Im very glad I got this and of course all fans should make the purchase. because there's good stuff here! So on a two tiered scale, it gets 4 stars for what it is and 3 stars because of what it might have been.Randy"
5,This sucks!,"This thing really moves some air! Helps airflow alot on my truck, and improved mpg 2-3. I used this with the FIPK kit, and recommend it for F150 owners."
4,Nail Polish Remover,This product is great - no more having to go through tons of cotton balls to remove nail polish - just dip and rub the polish off.
4,Closest I'll Get,"I absolutely love the clash. i am too young however to have seen them play but what i would do to have been at just one clash concert. this album is the closest ill ever get to being at a show and i love it. it has most of the good songs but then again its impossible to get all the good ones on a single cd. my only reason for not rating this cd a 5 is that it has only 17 tracks and is missing some of the great ones like police on my back, clampdown, or washington bullets but it is a great cd. if you havent often heard the clash live you should get this album. it is a new experience from the studio versions and shows the clash at their best, in concert. CLASH FOR ETERNITY."
4,"please, sir, may I have some more?","We can quibble over the track selection and varying sound quality forever, but the one indisputable failure of this disc is that Sony failed to fill it. Why would they do such a thing?A) Because they ran out of materialB) Because they don't careC) Because they are lazyD) Because they know that fans of The Clash have been rabidly awaiting any live morsel thrown them for the last 20+ years.I don't work at Sony, so I don't know for sure, but my guess is that it's mostly D, with a little of B and C thrown in for good measure. Anyone with a bootleg of the Bonds shows knows that it is not A, because there is plenty of other rockin' material out there. If they could clean up ""Complete Control,"" they could certainly clean up the rest. That said, the morsel we do get here is generally solid and occasionally fantastic, a tantalizing hint of what could be."
4,Essential for Clash fans,"This is a great addition to the Clash catalog. Infact, I think I prefer some of these live versions to the studio ones. For example, I Fought the Law, The Magnificent Seven, Should I Stay or Should I go, and Straight To Hell sound much better here than in the original albums. I think the only reason why I give this album a 4 instead of a 5 is because they don't have all the songs I'd like to hear. The inclusion of Clampdown and Hateful would've been nice. I would've also wanted Jail Guitar Doors, Janie Jones, and Lightning Strikes (Not once but twice), among other songs... Oh well. I guess if I had my way, it would've ended up being a triple CD deal. Anyway, buy it fool!"
5,This CD Rocks,"If you like The Clash you owe it to yourself to purchase this CD. It Rocks. The songs drip with the energy that The Clash are so famous for. Some of their most memorable songs are here, all live and all fired up. Especially good are the versions of Armadideon Time, Know Your Rights, and Should I Stay or Should I Go. The live versions add a whole new dimension to these songs.You will love this CD. It's the best live CD I own."
5,THE BEST LIVE ALBUM I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME!,"I can't seem to get enough of this album. I listen to it every chance I get. There are some truly incredible songs on this album. Nothing, and I do mean nothing, is better then the live version of MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Well, maybe I FOUGHT THE LAW. No, wait, COMPLETE CONTROL takes the cake. Ahh, who am I kidding, all the songs are great, no one song is better then any of the others.What are you waiting for? Buy this album already!"
4,i agree,"this is my first clash cd, but i do own everything by them on vinyl! and it's been years since i listened to those LP's. this cd brings back lots of great memories of live shows i saw in nyc in 79-82. sure, it's commercial and it fails to include many of the songs die hard clash fans want. buy it anyway."
5,A Great Album,"This is a fine album, one I'm sure you will like, but live albums were never my favorites. It's so difficult to capture the excitement of the live show. The music reminds me of Tin Huey, whose latest album has just been released, and though there is one live song on that album, the Hueys decided to go with the control they got from studio mixes."
5,THE BEST CITY ROCKERS,I HEARD THIS CD AND I FIND IT FANTASTIC.I AM A BIG FAN OF THE CLASH BUT I VE NEVER SEEN THEM LIVE.I HAVE SEEN ONLY SOME LIVE VIDEOS BUT THIS CD IS FANTASTIC.I AM ALSO HAPPY BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME MY ROCK PAST AND THE BEST ROCK YEARS!BRAVO CLASH!
5,Clear the floor & turn it UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The greatest band ever is back with a vengeance. My only two complaints are the absence of ""Death or Glory"" and any numbers higher than 10 on my volume knob."
4,"Great, but why so many Terry Chimes Trax?","My fave band of all time at their best... but, why so many trax with their orig drummer, who couldn't hold a candle to Topper? The energy on the trax he plays is *so* much lower than the Topper trax. Listen to 'em back to back. Worth buying and listening to over and over, though."
5,Still The Only Band That Matters,"Many have tried and many have failed. No band can match the energy of The Clash live. Having seen them twice, I have yet to see any band come close.This CD is a great representaion of The Clash live. A must have. It shows that The Clash are still THE ONLY BAND THAT MATTERS!"
5,Wonderful dolls,These dolls are great! My daughter and 2 nieces always want to play with these dolls over all the other dolls. We have sets to be sure there are enough to go around.They are snuggly and small enough for them to carry around. I personally love that the clothes don't come off! I tire of hunting down doll socks and with these I don't have to!Great dolls.
4,how cute,"My cousin loves these dolls. She loves that she gets to be a ""little mommy"" to a boy AND girl...that's what i love about this set...plus the dolls are adorable and the only thing I don't like about them is the hats. I wish the hats were...cuter? I don't know but it doesn't matter. I'd buy these dolls for any really little girl. She used to cry when she lost accessories for her other dolls...but at least with these there isn't much to lose."
1,Piece of Junk!!!!!!!!!!,Our boy doll arrived without a nose! Fisher Price will NOT give us a new doll to replace the broken doll. Don't waste your money!!!!!!
1,Wrong item,I received the wrong item. It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my little girl and I had to hurry and find this item at another store. The company still has not sent me a call ticket for UPS to come and pick it up so I can receive a refund after many emails. I will not be purchasing from this company ever again.
4,is this toy fun?,i just wanted to see if a person got it because i am geting the toy and it looks cute and i just love babydolls there the only thing i like the best at of all the toys and i am growing up im telling you i love baby dolls please say this toy is good please please please ? if you have any info about this toy contact me at [...]thanks everybody i love you all....
2,Where's Dr Hook??????,"Dr Hook put the magazine on the map with their 1972 hit single Cover Of Rolling Stone, but still they're left out here and also excluded from the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock.They were cool enough to promote your rag, but not to mention in any of your publications, huh?Shameful and ignorant!!!"
4,Rolling Stone Illustrated; History of Rock and Roll,"Just got the book, It's in good to new condition, I received it within 6 days, actually got it on day 5. Good Price, condition and shipping costs. Pleasure doing business. Thanks once again."
4,Where's Three Dog Night?,"Conspicuously absent, that's where; ditto for Billy Joel. That's why I gave it four stars."
5,LOVE IT!,"I really enjoy this book, it is very interesting and illustrated in such a wonderful way. I highly recommend for Rock N Roll history lovers! Price was great and I received it quite speedily!"
4,Palm Treo 700 Screen Protector,This is a very well made screen protector. It is a little tricky to install but worth it. It reduced the glare much better than my old one particularly outside in direct sun.
1,Only two screen protectors?,I desired a screen protector for my horribly abused but greatly loved Palm Treo 650. So I desired to get the Palm? Anti-Glare Screen Protectors to make up for my past trangressions.I was horribly disapointed to find out that it only contained 2 plastic screens. Only 2 that retails for $14.99. This product is a horrible rip off. How much can two plastic screens with sticky backs cost? I knew I was probably going to get ripped off since it is a vanity product but I at least expected 10 protective screens for that price.Please don't be stupid like me and purchase this product.
3,nice book,I find this book very colourful and full of nice ideas. Can't wait to make some nice jewelry for myself and friends...It would be nicer if they have more step by step pictures for real beginner like me..

1,Belt clip,The two part button that is used to secure the zen to the belt clip was snapped together when it arrived not allowing the button to be inserted in the holder.You cannot separate the button when it is snapped together making the belt clip uselessI believe that I should be sent another unit
1,cheap,"Should be a 25 cent item, very cheap. Not worth the price! My kids tried it and does not make it easy to move controls. Way not worth it. Gave it one star because it comes in great colors!"
4,Good enough,"It's pretty much what I expected. It's got a good feel to it, and the clip is easy to attach once you figure it out. For the price I can't complain."
3,Ok quality,The top open space where you insert the mp3 player was torn a bit. I was worried that the entire case would rip while inserting the mp3 player but it held. I doubt it will withstand removing and replacing too many times.
4,creative skin case,"transaction was smoothe and fast. case works great, now I don't have to hold it any more. the clip part isn't the best quality material and wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be. I was a little worried that it wasn't going to be sturdy enough but so far it's worked."
1,"Inaccurate, too small to stand on, and a waste of money","The weight measurements fluctuate +/- 10 or more pounds on back-to-back uses. Maybe partly because it is too small and not flat, and the instructions don't even tell you where to stand on it to get accurate measurements. I weigh about 178 pounds and I was getting measurements from 162 to 185 pounds."
1,Worse off than no scale at all!,"The whole point of having a scale is pretty simple; you get on it, and it accurately tells you your weight. This product does not do that. It gives highly fluctuating readings such that one never knows their actual weight. It is advertised to be accurate within .2 lbs. No way on earth is that correct! You'd expect a digital scale with these features to be more accurate than a mechanical scale, but that is just not the case. This is an awful product. Do not buy it! Either go with a good mechanical scale that will be consistent, or invest in a reliable scale. I bought this thing and have no idea what I weigh. Awful...just awful."
4,Good solid weight scale,"This scale isn't perfect. Although honestly I don't think you can find a perfect one. This one performs much better than previous ones I have used. It may not be completely accurate, however, it is consistent. Which, for weight management is a much more important attribute."
1,batteries don't last,"I had to replace the batteries constantly, and we only used the scale once a day. Batteries would last a week or two topsDon't buy!"
2,Defective,"I bought this scale because the price and reviews sat well. I weighed myself as soon as I opened the package and it worked fine. When I went to weigh myself a few days later I only got an error. I had to return the product.Otherwise I did not like that it creaked when I got on it. I was kind of afraid it was going to break, and I am no where near the weight limit."
1,Awful!,"I got this scale in 2008 and I wish I returned it back then.It's completely inaccurate.The surface is uneven, so depending how you step on it, you get different results. There is either more pressure in the front, or in the back. My weight fluctuate 1 pound every time I step on the scale - maybe not much for some people, but I'm on a mission to lose weight and 1 pound is a big deal for me.This scale sucks!"
1,Accurate at first--then????,"I purchased this product in November 2008. It was very accurate at first. A month ago (7 months after purchase), it began to go wildly wrong. Weight would vary 2 lbs in successive weighings just seconds apart. Changed the battery. Didn't help. Website for Healthometer in the frequently asked questions section indicates that the scale can vary up to one pound either direction. Not good enough even if my scale was within that standard, especially since it purports to weigh tenths of a pound. A waste of money."
2,simply not the best,"The scale looks very nice. It is lightweight. It takes way to long to calibrate and if you want to weigh yourself a second time, you have to stand there and wait for the screen to clear and then recalibrate. Sometimes it gives me the same weight 3 times in a row, other times, it will give me 3 different weights. It is only off by maybe a pound or two though. If I had to go back, I probably wouldn't have bought this model."
4,Scale,I had a hard time figuring out how to measure body fat and bone content...but I think I've got it now. It was just as accurate as my previous scale.
3,good only for measuring 1-2 pound increments,"I wish I wouldn't have purchased this scale. I'm a daily weigher and need a scale that can accurately measure fractions of a pound. This scale doesn't do it, and probably no strain gauge scale can. I should have bought a balance scale. If you only weigh yourself once a week (or less frequently) or don't care about fractions, you'll probably find this scale suitable. It's attractive and easy to read."
4,a good scale,"Large numbers that are easy to read. Weight is giving to the tenth of the a pound--a degree of detail that's misleading, probably, since a person's weight will vary by a pound or two day by day. The slightly contoured plastic face of the scale feels oddly flexible to me (I weigh about 200 lbs.) but that seems not to matter."
4,Works perfectly,"I received my first scale three days ago. It worked fine for the first day. The second day it decided to reset itself every time I tried to step on it, even after waiting for it to zero out. Due to Amazon's amazing customer support and the fact that I live within an hour of Seattle, I got a replacement scale today.This one seems to be working much better. I've weighed myself throughout the day and it seems to be within a pound or so each reading. It is reading about 6 pounds heavier than my $10 dial scale we bought 5 years ago. Tomorrow I will be weighed at the doctor's office and will know which one is more correct. Either way, I can add or subtract a few pounds as long as it is consistent, which this one seems to be. Now hopefully this one works tomorrow."
4,Logo was on upside down...or glass was on backwards,"I have not used this scale much, but so far everything seems to be working well. I wanted to write a review to let everyone know that when I received my scale, the ""Healthometer"" logo was on backwards. Or, perhaps, they put the glass on upside down. I emailed Healthometer about this, and never received a response. I didn't want to pay to ship it back, so I just tried to remove the logo myself, and found that Acetone works very well. I used 100%, but perhaps nail polish remover would also work. I hope that if you also have this problem this info is useful to you. :)"
3,Health o Meter HDL820KD-18 Digital Scale,Health o Meter HDL820KD-18 Digital Scale with LCDThe price is right.
1,Not accurate,"I purchased this ""scale"" and every time I used it I would get off and then back on to test the accuracy. Hhahahah, it would vary up to 5lbs. So If you want a scale to monitor you weight go with something else. If you want a scale to gamble on with your friends about what will come up on the display then buy this one. I returned and bought a different one that I am very happy with."
1,Useless,After 5 months of use this scale became totally useless. It uses 7 segment LCDs for it's numbers and some of the segments became erratic and you could not tell what the real reading was. For example; if the 3rd # was acting up you might not know if you weighed 207 lbs or 201 lbs or 203 lbs or 208 lbs! It would become more pronounced if it was the 1st or 2nd digit. Five months of reliable use is unacceptable. Look elsewhere.
3,I gained a pound in an hour.,"I have been happy with the scale but I noticed something interesting today. After waking up this morning I showered, dried of and got on the scale. It read 192.4. I sat at my computer for 15 minutes. Out of curiosity I went and weighed myself again. It read 193.0. I went back to the computer for another 15 minutes, got up and to see what my weight was now. It read 193.4. I have not put anything into my body this morning. (or let anything out) There has been no change in temp. I am wearing the same thing all three times. Maybe this is just how the human body works. Now it is eight minutes after last trip to the scale and I am now at 193.6. I better stop writng reviews and get up and do something before I explode today."
1,Poor Quality Product But Amazon Backs It Up,"Product failed shortly after purchase.Manufacturer would not pay for product return, and return cost was equal to cost of product.Amazon stepped in, arranged for free return, and sent me a replacement product from their stock, with no charge or hassle.Zero credit for product and its manufacturer, and lots of good will for Amazon.Health o Meter HDL820-18 Digital Scale with LCD"
3,Thank you reviewers,"Was about to write a glowing review of this scale I've had for 2.5 years. I think it's an attractive design and I'm still on the first battery. I would occasionally weigh myself twice just to make sure it was working accurately and it never failed to register the same weight twice. Another review recommended weighing something else between weighings which would produce inconsistent results. Just weighed myself 3 times, each time following me holding an object of about 20 lbs. I got 177.2, 178.2, and 178.0. I guess a 1 lb swing isn't too bad for a bathroom scale like this but that sound you hear is my heart breaking . . . just a little."
5,It told me I'm fatter than I though ;-),"I have had this scale for a little more than a month and so far I am quite pleased...except for the lack of deniability. Not that the scale is inaccurate mind you, the fluctuations are consistent with what you should expect your body to do throughout the day. I have weighed myself repeatedly with an accuracy of less than a pound of fluctuation which can also be expected depending on where your center of gravity is in relation to your standing position on the scale.Overall I find the scale to be very consistent and accurate (and my wife agrees, just don't tell her I said so) and would recommend purchasing this scale. However, the display has large, clear, bold numbers so if you are in denial, like me, and don't want a scale that reaches out and slaps you with a number you didn't want to see...get a scale you can't read!"
1,no headache,I dislike health o meter scale. Every time need to tap not once but few time to get to work. Then every time you get on the scale and many time it said error. I only had the scale for five days only. I send it back.. Not worth the headache..
3,Good enough for the purpose,"Pros: Easy to use, big numbers, measurement in lbs and kgs :)Cons: Not very accurate, if the surface is too hard or too soft. For me it gives consistent results somewhere in the middle."
4,not that accurate,"I'll weigh myself, come back in 5 minutes without drinking anything or doing anything that would affect my weight, and I'll have magically lost a few ounces."
4,Health O Meter,"Although I believe the scale to be accurate and easy to read, it does not always start up easily when I tap it to begin. I have had to manually pick it up and shake it before I can get it to come up with the dashes on the digital dial."
3,Inconsistent Readings,I loved everything about this scale except for the fact that I could step on it three different times and get three different readings - all within 3-5 pounds of each other.
1,May have 2 Pound Margin of Error,"I find in my use that this scale has shown a 2 pound margin of error in my weight range of around 195 pounds. Depending on where I place my feet, I can get a 2 pound variance. That it offers tenths of a pound in its display is ridiculous in light of this broad variance. I can use the scale consistently however, though it may not refleect true weight, if I am careful to always place my feet in the same location and always stand with the same weight distribution on ball and heel and take 5-7 weighings and accept the weight that comes up most often. That's a lot to do and maybe its not worth the low cost to put up with this. I am sorry I purchased this one."
2,Inconsistent measurement,The scale looks fine and is easy to operate. However it has one fatal flaw - the weight measurement fluctuates a lot - approx 6-8 pounds for the same person in consecutive measurements. I returned it the day after arrival.
4,scale,"I hate to admit it but this scale is consistently accurate. I wish sometimes it would lie, but it won't ! Easy to read dial. Easy to cleanHealth o Meter HDL820KD-18 Digital Scale with LCDI have recommended (will do so again) this product to other friends."
4,Scale,"I'm not overly obsessed with my weight (160lb), but wanted to know a little more often than my annual checkup at the doctor's. Pretty easy to use, but need to get used to how to ""activate"" it. You need to tap it, wait for it to calibrate, then you can get on, and it displays your weight pretty quickly. Decent buy, but I think it could have been a little cheaper (by a few bucks, not that much)."
4,Not bad for the price,"Looks neat , works fine.Sometimes it is off a little bit if used in quick succession but on the whole a satisfactory purchase."
2,Not quite what I expected...,"This scale did not meet my expectations. The unit is small and not easy to step onto - your feet have to be closely placed. Even my wife, who's 5'1"" and slender did not like the size. Accuracy is OK, but like many scales, the weight changes a little each time you step on. I recorded 3 different weights by stepping on and off about 5 times, with a 1 1/2 lb. variation from high to low. I took an average as my true weight. Again, not what I had hoped for in terms of accuracy or consistency."
1,Junk,"Mine broke. I bought this scale 10 months ago. I initially thought it needed a new battery, but nope. This cheap scale did not even last one year.- Rocket Scientist"
3,Scale,Was an okay scale/ didn't seem to be the most accurate/ but pretty close I guess. Not very durable though as this scale lasted only about a year. It did look nice though. Am looking for a new scale now/don't think I would purchase this scale again.
3,Good enough for me I guess.,"It varies weight a bit.if you weight yourself right after, it stays same.Basically it is a liar. However, I don't care about few pounds down or up it usually gives me.If accurate weight with errors < .5 lb is a requirement, dont buy this."
5,Great Basic Scale,"I've been very happy with this scale, because it gives me a quick, accurate measurement. It isn't fancy, but allows me to track my weight on a daily basis."
2,you gotta be nuts,"For 7,000.00 smakers I can take anyine on a tour of italy in style you will Tast the foods & meet the chefs. Or you can take 7,000.00 smakers and feed a couply of hungry and homeless people Italian food for a year! in short get real take a vacation experience the foods & wines & most imporntant the people of Italy. Steve."
5,Wonderful music!,"My 3 year old loves listening to the story and music of Peter and the Wolf. Each animal is represented by an instrument. Peter is the violin, the bird is the flute, the cat is the clarinet, the duck is the oboe, Grandfather is the bassoon, the horn is the wolf, and the drums are the hunters. When my son hears the different sounds he loves identifying the characters. The other music is lovely and it's great to listen to in the car. I highly recommend this CD."
3,Fairly Standard Horror Fare,"Misa the Dark Angel is about a young witch who insiutates herself into a bording school for girls when she and her crusty mentor decide a magical curse rests over the place. Misa, however, being a lonely teenager with no friends, become enamoured with the 'normal' life led by the students at the school and looses sight of why she is there.And that's when the terror begins.There is nothing particularly bad about this film. The acting is solid, the camera work, lighting, and sets are all used to full effectiveness to underscore the horror and mystery of the events that unfold, and the cast members die in appropriately ironic ways. (That said, 'Misa the Dark Angel' is *not* a teenage slasher flick, even if the above sentence might imply that.) On the other hand, there's nothing that really stands out, either. It's a solid effort, nothing more."
2,not as I expected,My daughter loves ALL DVD and ALL animal related DVD/books.She didn't get hooked on this DVD. She didn't find it interesting and I didn't see result of learning anything new.
5,My daughter loves this video,my 16 month old loves this video! I have to admit the music is cute. I would highly recommend!
2,La Grande Illusion : censored,"Just a warning: the copy of La Grande Illusion in this set is a censored one (presumably post war Britain), two scenes being amputated for ""moral"" reasons (a French escaped soldier CAN NOT fall in love with a German war widow).No need to say more..."
3,"Interesting, but recording problems",There is little to add to the previous comment as well as the Grammophone review.I had problems of high pitch in the first track. Other than that an excellent CD that shows you that there is more than Chopin and Beethoven in piano
3,OK collection of Wyndham Hill Jazz artists they were promoting,"WH was all over the place in this Jazz artist summary, if they had only focused on smooth jazz they would have been better off."
2,NOT very good,These are not anything like the bangers I enjoyed while living there. I was really looking forward to showing my friends what a banger was like and why i've missed them so much. I won't be sharing these with anyone!
4,Honeymoon's over!!,"I couldnt put this book down. It was sexy and smart. Nora Sinclair was a black widow and John O'Hara was out to get her - in several ways!! :DDifferent premise. Kept my interest all the way thru. Read it in one morning. Everyone got what was coming to them in the end. Susan's relationship to John was a surprise - almost. The cover was confusing - a young couple sailing on a sailboat, but I guess I could accept it in a stretch. Also, I would have liked to know why Olivia killed Nora's father in the first place.Never have I read 117 chapters in such a short period of time. I wonder if Patterson always does this to keep you reading after the end of a chapter. It works for me!!!!"
2,Thriller? Suspense? Scariest?,"The book jacket implies this is Patterson's best and compares it to Hitchcock. It is further touted as 2005 International Thriller of the Year. The book chronically lacks suspense and has rather predictable twists and turns. I fail to see how it qualifies as a thriller or a whodunit. The writing is common and fails to engage the reader. It is billed as Patersons sexiest and scariest and fails at both. The sex is repetitive, not sensual. The murders are predictable and repetitive. If you want a quick, not much to ponder read - this is a good choice."
2,Not as good as the real James Patterson.,A good book to read when you have many other things on your mind. No concentration is needed because the story is very far fetched.
4,Excellent read!,"Patterson rarely dissapoints and Honeymoon is no exception. I highly recommend this book!The characters are well fleshed out and are almost all sympathetic in one way or another. Even our ""black widow"" Nora is marginally sympathetic. And I love the O'Hara character.I could hardly put this book down (I even read it during my coffee breaks)."
3,Half Finish,"I am only half way through the book and if the last half is as good as the beginning, then this will be worth five(5) stars."
2,Popcorn,"I found it like Popcorn. Tasty and filling but not that nourishing. Kind of light weight and predictable. I could think of 20 better endings and maybe a weightier storyline with at least one more main character. Oh, well, they all can't be 'the best'."
4,Honeymoon Review,"I read this book in a 2 days, I couldn't put it down. The short chapters switching between Nora's life and that of O'Hara were so interesting I resented any interruption.I only had a few complaints with the book, I really wanted to know what was in the letter Nora put in her mothers purse and I thought there should have been more build up to Nora's just reward. I also wanted to know more about her mothers past because I thought Nora killed her father and her mother took the fall for it.In spite of any shortcomings this was a great read."
2,Sophmoric,Considering his other books this one is sophmoric. I'd liken it to as simplistic and predictable as a Lifetime made for TV movie. Extremely disappointing.
4,Another Great Thriller,"In Honeymoon, Patterson again delivers a suspenseful and thrilling novel. John O'Hara, an undercover FBI agent, is in hot pursuit of a lethal serial killer, Nora Sinclair. Patterson delivers many twists in the plot that add depth to the story. The dialog is witty and realistic. There's lots of smoldering sex and sensuality along the way without going over the top. Unlike the Alex Cross novels which are more graphic and have more of a grisly, psychotic killer quality, Honeymoon brings a different kind of suspenseful edge with the cool, calculating Nora Sinclair. You won't be disappointed. A page turner to be sure."
2,Needs help,"James Patterson stopped writing good novels when he wrote When the Wind Blows. After that horrible, lousy and badly written book, everything has gone downhill. Someone recommended this book to me, and with doubt, I read it. Please, somebody help James Patterson to write again!!"
2,Patterson Bores With Silliness,"Nothing about this book rings true - a brilliant, beautiful woman likes to kill husbands, but why? Just because she is a psychopath? We are given no clue. Do not waste your time!"
4,Things aren't always the way they appear...,"At the beginning things appear on the surface as ""normal"" with a beautiful woman which is very successful on her field (interior design) and a very handsome and rich man successful (naturally) on his field as well. But as the plot continuing rolling things aren't as peaceful as they appear at all!! And our beautiful designer appears to have a ""killing mission"" for her wealthy boyfriends/husbands....This is when FBI agent O'Hara steps into the story. But will he be able to save himself from falling into her deadly hands...? You should read and found out for yourself.A very fast paced thriller which i couldn't stop reading although some parts and the end in particular were quite predictable..."
3,Too Many Loose Ends,I loved the flow of the story but nothing bugs me more than an unfinished storyline. Loose ends galore. So many in fact that I reread some of the chapters trying to find out what I missed with the letter from Nora's mom. Why did the Mom not let on to Nora that she was coherent? Damn I wish James Patterson could explain what was meant by the letter. It seemed to hold all the clues but wasnt revealed to the readers.
2,Thriller - NOT,I should have known when in May the cover stated it was the 2005 International Thriller of the Year.... when the year isn't even over! This is not a thriller....while it is a very easy read...the story has no depth and the ending is a MAJOR disappointment. Not worth purchasing the hardcover.
1,Waste of Time,"As an avid Patterson reader, I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. I felt like the author had more important things on his mind and just threw this together. I want my money and time back! What a waste of this brilliant author's talents."
3,"A good read, but not super","This is a fun, fast paced book. It has a few decent twists, but it isn't a world beater."
2,Disappointed,"The Honeymoon was over at the first chapter. I kept waiting for my feelings to become engaged by any of the characters. It never happened. I love the Alex Cross books and the Women's Circle books. There is a passion that Mr. Patterson normally creates in in those books that never appears in this one. I never cared about the persons who were killed,the killer or the FBI agent.There are usually strong surprises in his novels. The surprises in this one were ""oh really"" or ""I knew that"". I truly hope Mr. Patterson's next novel makes me care about the people involved. This is the first novel by him that I would not recommend as a must read."
1,I was gypped!!!,"I first read Four Blind Mice and liked the pacing, the plot and the way the reader was led to discover plot twists and outcomes. I then looked forward to London Bridge. Woops, a big mistake. I figured that anyone can crank our a lemon once in awhole and read the reviewes for The Honeymoon and bought it. Geeze, what a dog. Its a good example of verbal product placement whether it be food, antiques or clothing. A scattered plot line and awkward to read. Sometimes its as though the authors mixed up the sequence of chapters."
1,Horrible,"Wow, this book was by far one of James Patterson's worst. No suspense, obvious outcome, nothing that surprises you, not stomach turning twists, a great dissappointment. I don't get what all the rave was about."
2,Another typical Patterson: all plot no substance,"The story's a page turner - - I'll give it that. But this book speeds along sloppily and crash lands in the ending, leaving seemingly significant plot threads dangling in a very unfulfilling way (Hellloooo? What happened to Nora's letter???. Patterson's books leave me feeling cheated. Almost like I've wasted my time. This is another one to read at the beach if nothing else is available and you're feeling a bit of sunstroke, and to leave behind."
4,Great read!,"This book has an interesting storyline, memorable characters, and surprises at every turn. Definitely a good read from James Patterson!"
4,Honeymoon,"This was the first Patterson book I read, and I loved it. It kept you guessing the whole way through."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"Honeymoon is my guilty pleasure. It tells the story of Nora Sinclair (what a name!), an irresistible, rich, and dangerous ""man-eater."" Sexy Nora has it all but she has also a dark soul. Let's be clear here: the story is immoral, full of sex, and murders -- and borders on silliness at times. But that's the whole point: it's a perfect escape. I found myself devouring this book in two weeks, curious to find out ""what's next?"" I think the secret of James Patterson is his uncanny capacity to create cliffhangers after each (short) chapters -- always making me wanting for more.A guilty pleasure. Indeed.Satisfying? You bet."
4,"James Patterson - Honeymoon, 2005","James Patterson - Honeymoon, 2005I saw a number of very bad reviews on this book that I honestly think was unfair. Although the novel was not exactly an original, it was rather a page turner. There were exciting moments--in fact quite a number of them-- the incidents were related, and the end justified the original body of the novel. I enjoyed reading it and I believe it merits some credit.In defense of JP, I must say that almost ALL authors, at one point or other in their concoction of fictions, do have uneasy times to create an original and a worthy work, and when that happens, critics have a field day. So easy to NOT understand. Would you say the master fiction-writer, Charles Dickens, was an excellent author? I would say yes. But even old Charlie couldn't escape the claws of bad criticism in his career.I recommend this book."
5,One of my favorites!,This is one of my favorites of James Patterson's books and I've read them all!!
1,Can't Recommend This One,"Nora Sinclair is a black widow. She kills the men in her life for financial gain. This isn't an original premise and it isn't done particularly well. I am surprised by all the glowing reviews for this book. I can't find much to recommend here. Nora is a truly despicable character. Some of the dialog is painfully silly. The sex scenes were gratuitous. The suspense...well, there wasn't much. It's all fairly predictable. The twist at the conclusion seemed like it was added at the last minute to save the story. It didn't work. Thankfully the chapters were short and the pace quick. I was grateful to be done with this one."
1,I should have saved my money!,"When James Patterson is ""on"" -- there is no one better. Unfortunately, this book is lame and he is way off his game. Honeymoon and London Bridges are two books that I was very sorry I spent money on. I don't know if he has a certain quota of books he has to fill each year or what, but Honeymoon has the feel of someone sitting down to bang out a book to meet a deadline/quota. It is not captivating or well-crafted at all. I will be much more cautious next time a new Patterson book comes out. I'm sure I will wait for the paperback (if I buy it at all) rather than shell out hardcover prices for subpar work."
1,Honeymoon,"This was the first book I read by Patterson and it will be the last. He had me with him until he lost his own train of thought in the middle of the book. Chapter 80 ends with a purse incident and is never metioned again. What happened to the letter from Nora's mom? Hello, the ending in one word a ""DISAPPOINTMENT"". oh and what's with two page chapters. I seen children books with more flare,,,"
3,The Honeymoon Is Over....,"This book was appropriately named Honeymoon as the main character Nora Sinclair seems to want to stay on a permanent honeymoon as she murders the men that she gets involved with. She is barely back from a honeymoon when she is planning their death and setting up another man. Enters John O'Hara an FBI agent who inadvertently ends up investigating Nora when her case gets entangled with another case that he is working on. O'Hara is your typical FBI agent who tends to do things his own way but does he cross the line when he becomes too involved with Nora?Although I enjoy a James Patterson novel on face value alone, this one was different. I didn't like it as much as his other novels and maybe that is because his hero or shall I say anti-hero, John O'Hara crossed the line between right and wrong. I prefer my characters to stick to a script and John O'Hara doesn't. Makes for interesting reading though."
3,Just Okay,"After reading several other reviews, it seems like I am in the minority in my opinion of this book. It follows the same format of other non-Alex Cross works which are co-written with other authors: Short Chapters/Shallow Characters.This book features John O'Hara, an F.B.I. agent assigned to the case of Nora Sinclair, a potential ""black widow"" who has several men she is involved with die under mysterious circumstances. His challenge is to investigate her without getting caught in her web. The book is ""mindless drivel"". Bring back Alex Cross."
1,Worst Patterson Book I've Readd,"I'm a little shocked at all of the great reviews for this book. I've read all of the Alex Cross and Women's Murder Club novels and found most of them highly enjoyable. This book, however, was very disappointing. It was completely unoriginal and left questions unanswered, such as what was in the letter Nora's mother gave her? It seemed to me it was written at record pace in an effort to capitalize on the Patterson name, but at the expense of the storyline and characters. If you must read it, get it from the library - don't waste your money."
2,It it really JP??,"Mr. Patterson has been putting out 3 or 4 books a year for the past several years. This one, more than any of the other that were co-authored is the most un-Patterson of all the co-authored ones. It just doesn't stand up to any of the Alex Cross books. The writing style is not even the same. I wonder if he is just lending his name to another writer? It is interesting enough to keep you turning the pages, but it is disappointing overall. The only saving grace is that it is a very fast read....doesn't take long to come to the final disappointment. A better idea, re-read ""Kiss The Girls""."
4,Good suspense,"I too was let down by the book's hype which claimed it was the international Thriller of the Year. It certainly did not qualify for that but still made for an interesting and suspenseful read.Patterson does a good job of gradually introducing the peripheral characters so that we can see what Nora, the portagonist, is like over time.Nora is a ""black widow"" who is motivated by greed and kills her husbands or fiances once she has access to their fortunes. Throughout the book we see how she is able to lead multiple lives and juggle her different men.John O'Hara is a great character who sets out to trap Nora, but who gets more than he anticipated. Patterson does a great job of not revealing until the end why O'Hara is even looking for Nora.I also enjoyed the scenes with Nora and her mother so that you get some sense of why Nora has become so very depraved.This book held my interest and kept me guessing. I would recommend it for a good mystery."
1,"I wish I could ""unread""","This is the worst book I've ever read. I'm not kidding. It would pale in comparison to anything a high school student could write in a creative writing class. It KILLS me that there are TWO authors...two people put their heads together to mastermind this epic trash? Seriously? And what's with all the heinous product name dropping? And why are the chapters so freaking short? I love another reviewer's comment about the sailboat cover...maybe the part where they were on a sailboat was edited out, because that chapter only filled one page, instead of the massive FOUR PAGE chapters us readers are supposed to wrap our puny intellects around. ( phew! I need to take a break after reading ten sentences! Maybe I'll go have a pint of Ben And Jerry's Cherry Garcia Ice Cream while I write this review at my Macintosh Pro G5 With Dual Core Intel Xeon Processor!)Insert expletives. Lots of them. I hate myself for reading this book."
2,No more James Patterson for me,"I think this will be my last James Patterson book. It's my 3rd and so far all of them have been cheesy and predictable. This one was probably the better of the 3, but still I'm left wondering how it is that all of these guys fall for Nora Sinclair and don't figure out she lives 3 different lives. Seems to me they'd eventually get suspicious of her constant travelling and inaccessibiity. As for the FBI's role in all of this drama, I genuinely hope they are not that nieve or dumb. It's hard for me to enjoy and follow a book that seems so unrealistic. And what's with all of the soft-porn scenes? I wasn't aware that I'd picked up a romance novel.Overall I'll give it a 2 because it did keep me entertained, even though in some cases I was laughing at how ridiculous it got."
4,"Engaging summer read, up to a point...","I enjoyed reading this book, but found it lacking in a couple of areas. Like another reviewer, I felt that the ending was abrupt. Also, why introduce the letter that Olivia placed in Nora's purse, and then not reveal the contents? The reader already knew that Olivia was not as impaired as originally portrayed. And, this may be a small thing, but the paperback I purchased had an illustration of a couple on a sailboat on the cover; unless I missed it, Nora wasn't on a sailboat at any time during the story."
4,BLACKEST WIDOW,"The prolific James Patterson, this time co-writing with Howard Roughan, continues his mastery of the suspense novel with this tidy little chiller about a very deadly but beautiful woman, Nora Sinclair. Nora manages to off her lovers/husbands with a non-traceable poison that makes their deaths look like heart attacks. FBI agent John O'Hara, posing as an insurance salesman named Craig Reynolds, tries to get the goods on her but finds himself attracted to this lovely vixen.While the Alex Cross novels remain Patterson's best work, this little thriller is immensely readable and hard to put down...Patterson's forte!"
3,Disconnected plots that don't seem to come together,"This is one of my least-liked books by this author. The book throws out a beginning situation that is hardly discussed through the text, leaving the reader wondering what relevance it had. The only thing that leads the reader on is the curiosity about how that starting scene is going to fit. In the end, it doesn't get meshed in very well. It was also boring and predictable that on almost every page we have to read about how stunning Nora is and that she has fantastic sex the minute she sees one of her boyfriends. Sex seemingly on every other page? Forget it. For this reader, way to much descriptive sex and too little original story."
4,Honeymoon,"I have not finished reading it. So far it is certainly interesting and I do wonder just how far this woman will go. I bought it quite by accident, but am not sorry. Mostly I like books with a variety ofinterests."
1,Don't read this one!!,"All I can say is that I am an avid reader and a real fan of most of Mr. Patterson's books. This one was a real disappointment! It started out good, but then ended up silly. The characters were shallow and the plot was ridiculous. I am a very disappointed fan!"
1,The worst,"OhmygoodnessThis has to be the shallowest, most ridiculous book I've ever read. I can't believe there's an audience for this nonsense. And what in the world is this award all about? Hokey award, hokey book. Finished only because nothing else was available to me while on a trip. So bad, I can't find words."
1,Save your money,"Obviously Mr. Patterson needed a little cash to finance this summer's vacation. Advertised on TV, 30% discounts the day it hits the stores, they new it was a ripoff before it went to the publisher. Now I remember whay I stopped reading this guy years ago. Save your money."
2,Nothing but simple.,"This novel may have been written in less than a week, with its cookie-cutter plotline and lack of characterization. Boring."
1,"Quick read but not ""2005 Thriller of the Year""",I felt like this story was predictable and kind of cheesy.
2,Predictable and childish,"Patterson can do better! Perhaps this was written mostly by the co-author, but I found this one to be a notch below other works by this author. A page-turner, yes, but mostly just to get it over with. Save your money and don't buy this one."
3,No suspense - none,"This is another short story drawn out to look like a novel with loose ends that are left dangling. What was in the letter written by the mother - why did the mother kill her husband - etc. etc.There were some plot elements that just made no sense at all; why was the fact that O'Hara's boss was also his ex-wife not reveled until the ending - does anyone believe that the FBI would tell a suspect that she might get 1.5 million dollar settlement from an insurance policy that does not even exist - etc. etc.The character development was so thin and shallow that I never cared who might be killed, victims, villain, or FBI agents.The best I can say is that it was an easy and quick read but with an ending that was definitely anti-climatic and disappointing."
3,Usual,"Usual Patterson...hard to put down, enjoyable read, but nothing ground breaking. Nora was a likeable murderer. At times we could predict where the book was taking us but it still left us with enough twists and turns to keep the pages flipping."
3,honeymoonreview,ive recently began reading james patterson novels and i like how he gives away the killers names in the beginning and not wait til the end of the book to reveal them. with honeymoon I thought at first the tourist was another character and not john o'hara the fbi agent but i picked up on that o'hara was craig reynolds. This part was a little confusing I thought it was too much for one person to play. The blond in the book that was following nora i had no clue who that was til the end shocker! Overall although i like james patterson this isnt one of the books i'd recommend if you like more suspense and murder id give this 3 stars out of 5
3,Omelette anyone?,Nora sinclair is a disturbed woman. although i liked the book it left me with some questions that never got answered like what was her purpose? She killed got money but never done anything with it so i didn't understand the point behind it all. The fact that Susan had a little mystery to her was great and so was John's even though i knew from reading what his identities were long before revealed. Overall the book kept my attention but i was expecting more from this celebrated author.This was my first James patterson book and it won't be my last. I hope to be able to crank out novel after novel like he does some day. I can't imagine how he do it but somehow he does. The next novel i'm planning to take a stab at is the quickie since the commercials had me wanting to read it.
2,Not Too Impressed with this One,"I've read many, many James Patterson books and have to say this one didn't do much for me. Yes, the first few pages were tantalizing, but didn't seem to realistically pan out at the end of the book. This book had considerable similarity to the movie, ""Basic Instinct"" (smart cop/agent falls for black widow killer) and, just as in that movie, I didn't care for either of the main characters in this book. Also, I was expecting some sort of revelation into Nora's motives (abusive father/husband, etc.), but never got that. Disappointing..."
3,Series Are Better,"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, but I've never much cared for his stand-alone books. This one was no exception.It's hard to give more than a few stars to a book where there is nothing likeable or redeeming about either of the main characters. However, it was a fast, easy read.Mr. Patterson should stick to his series work and stop working with co-authors."
4,Death on a plate,"I truly believe James Patterson could write an obituary that would wind up on the bestseller list! Even though Alex Cross is not in this story, Patterson still has all the elements we fans have come to love and expect. He has a rich, exciting story-line, wonderfully created characters and a roller-coaster ride plot.Nora Sinclair loves rich, handsome men, she loves them to death... literally. She has several men, located all over the US and juggles them nicely. When she is done with them, she cooks them her specialty, death on a plate! She may have met her match in John O'Hara, an FBI agent hot on her heels. Hope his appetite doesn't include Nora. It just wouldn't be healthy diet choice.It doesn't matter who co-authors his books, Patterson is one of the most consistent writers I have ever had the pleasure of reading and Honeymoon delivers."
4,Honeymoon,"I enjoyed Honeymoon very much. It was enjoyable and a quick read. Not as intricate as his Alec Cross novels, but still a good purchase."
3,Not great but readable,"The new titles from Patterson seem to be hit or miss now. This was an ok read and I did enjoy it, but it was certainly no ""Kiss The Girls"". And, if you're expecting anything like the earlier Patterson pieces, you'll be sadly disappointed."
2,No good at all!,"Love James Patterson. Have read just about all his books. But this one was a real disappointment! Not what I consider typicle Patterson. Long, drags on about nothing. Boring to the point of being almost stupid. I'm assuming the other author with him wrote most of this one. Can't even believe Patterson put his name on this one.I would put this one in the must-not-read column! Don't wast your money or your time."
4,trash at its best,"Shakespeare it's not, but Honeymoon is a perfect beach read. I was staying in a condo on Oahu and this novel was in the living room ""library."" I picked it up and couldn't put it down for two days. I had much more sensible books waiting in my bag, but I absolutely LOVED Honeymoon. It was just fun, sexy, silly, and entertaining. A perfect vacation read - escape from reality while you are escaping reality!"
4,Satisfying fast read,"I enjoyed reading this one, on a hot, rainy, summer afternoon. The plot was there and kept me interested. The character development was little lax but otherwise, this was another good James Patterson read."
3,Predictable,"Honeymoon was a black widow type story with little hidden and few surprises. It was predictable, but a good black widow story."
3,Eh,"Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this book. The novel seemed to be quite cliche. Although I read it rather quickly, I would attribute that more to the short chapters and quick pacing, rather than it being a truly engaging book. When I finished the book, I didn't feel that sense of closure that I normally would with a book. In a sense, it almost seemed like I had wasted my time by reading it. I definitely preferred London Bridges (the last Alex Cross novel) over Honeymoon, when comparing Patterson's recent novels."
5,Another Book of the Master that I couldnt put down!,"OMG where to begin! One of my bff encouraged me to read this b/c another one is coming out soon and I was NOT disappointed, I can't believe people gave it less than 3* but to each there own. Nora Sinclair is comparable to the black widow get a rich man and kill him! Married or not and she did it and it worked and so she continues....Her mother also was a killer which is often the case with the physcho's of today someone killed in there family and they inherited the gene....FBI agen John O'hara is investigating Nora but gets caught up with her and it leads to no good. I was shocked by Lizzie and would like to know more about her and about the letter that Olivia wrote to Nora...I hope to read about those in the book to come i think this summer....READ it you wont be disappointed b/c i couldn't put it down and it is almost 400 pages in paperback! Keep up the good work Mr. Patterson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good beach book, but not Patterson's best","This is an interesting story, but he doesn't develop the characters very much and that's kind of disappointing."
1,Harlequin Romance,"This is at best a ""romance"" novel with embarrassingly bad sex scenes. It is no Dan Brown mystery novel, and it's not likely to do much for you romantically either."
1,Not original - JP just wanted more money...,"Don't waste your time or money on this book. I've read all of the James Patterson novels and the last few have been going downhill. This book is definitely the worst. It's recycled material from 'made for TV movies' and bad material at that. If you want an old story, characters you don't care about and just want to give JP some more cash, go ahead and buy it. I doubt I'll be reading any more of his books."
2,Only so so,"Normally I love James Patterson. I got hooked on him as a teen with Along Came A Spider.However, this book was very average. The subplot could have been more developed. Its explanation seemed rushed and somewhat of an afterthought.As far as the main female character, I found myself thinking more than once that some of her actions would have led to her demise/ capture less than half way through the book. I just never really felt that she was clever enough to get away with everything she does. I also felt there needed to be more of an explanation as to what drove her to kill. The reader is given clues, but left unsatisfied.The end of the book is rather anti climactic, and predictable. That never used to be the way of Patterson's books. The entire novel felt rushed to me. I'm still willing to give Patterson a chance but I'll be borrwing his next novel from the local library."
3,A Production-Line Patterson,"I am a great fan of James Patterson. I own almost all of his books. Having said that, I can say that this ""International Thriller of the Year"" did not thrill me. It has Patterson's short chapters and nonstop action, but its resemblance to his earlier books stops there. It has a painfully-predictable plot, an unbelievable protagonist, and an ending that deteriorates into political babble. Nora Sinclair is a serial killer and the most interesting thing in the book. John O'Hara is an FBI agent in pursuit of Nora, but he has no resemblance to any FBI agent that I have known. They are smart. He is stupid. The story plods along with him doing one foolish thing after another. Toward the end, I was rooting for Nora to rid the FBI of this embarrassment, but it didn't happen. If you are stuck for hours in an airport, this story might pass the time for you, but I hope that Patterson will fire O'Hara and bring us more of his genuine thrillers."
1,Bomb,Patterson needs to stop trying to publishing one book right after another and go back to the Alex Cross type of stories. I am a big Patterson fan but this left me totally bored!
4,Honeymoon by James Patterson,"I have been a fan of James Patterson for years. Although I haven't finished reading this book, I am sure that I'm going to enjoy it just as I've enjoyed all his others. I have not been disappointed with any of his books."
4,Die on Honeymoon,Will u love to get married and kill your husbands?Nora Sinclar do and she just can't get away from it.Why do she kill her husbands?For the money.Did she get away with it?Read the book and see.Perfect book.If u love thriller books.Read this.
2,"Yikes, read this first.","Okay, First you should know this is a ""black widow"" story. If only they said so on the box. Secondly it has NOTHING to do with sailing.Major Plot Flaws...The lead fem, who is the superior force, gets the drop on her opponent. By definition she should then defeat him easily.There's a poison that works on everyone but her foe.???The extremely intelligent predator makes a stupid mistake that leads her foe to her (maybe the author isn't smart enough to catch her without cheating).She gets away for THE STUPIDEST REASON EVER HEARD OF.I HATE the...good guy gives up his gun in the shootout to then shoot the enemy with his hidden pistol... scenario.There are some small golden moments though.1. the beginning.2. after hearing the secret agents thoughts on deceiving the fem, hearing her suspicion of him from the moment she met him - truly a golden momentUnfortunately, I purchased ""London Bridges"" with this one. Stuck with another bad novel. Read my review."
3,Different from his previous novels,"Mr. Patterson is one of my favorite authors. I usually rush out to buy the newest Alex Cross novels and immediately place my name on the wait list at my library. Honeymoon was just different. A little more ""trashy"", but different. I wish he wrote more about Nora's mom.... that would have added more to the plot and may be gave us more insight to why Nora killed her husbands. And what was in the letter that she wrote to Nora??? And the part about the Tourist? That was a little confusing. I say check it out at your library. But still at least read it."
4,Patterson Has Created Another Deadly Parasite That I Love!,"James Patterson (with the help of Mr Roughan) has created another baddy that I truly enjoyed. I usually listen to my audiobooks at home, but the Honeymoon traveled with me in the car and beyond. It was nice to listen to an audiobook with a female nasty lead. Hope Davis is wonderful as the sexy voice for Nora and Campbell Scott is simply hot as O'Hara. Black widow yes, deadly you bet!! I highly recommend this audiobook!!"
3,Quick read,"My first Patterson book. It was entertaining, a good afternoon read. Gorgeous female lead sleeping with hot guys and then killing them off. For some reason I thought the ""Thriller of 2005"" would prevent me from sleeping at night (like a Jeffrey Deaver novel or Silence of the Lambs or something) but it wasn't scarey at all."
1,"Forget the Honeymoon, Ask for a Divorce","Got to hand it to Patterson and his publisher. They know how to make a buck BUT caveat emptor.This is the second hunk of junk from Patterson after London Bridges. More of the same.Miniscule plot, tired and repetitive theme done before.A complete waste of time - won't bore you with capsule comments on the plot and characters.The goal must be $$ rather than a book to treasure.Buy something else - like Robert Crais Or Lawrence Block."
4,"Good, not great","This book continues the trend of Patterson novels that seem to be written quicker and give much less thought to plausibility. But, I must confess, I held on for the ride and enjoyed it."
3,Not so Good,"Now I've gotten hooked on the Alex Cross series. I even read 1st to die. Not a bad book, but not Alex Cross. When I read Honeymoon, I was a little disappointed. I must admit, I really like the way Patterson writes. Short chapters and a very easy read. The characters were interesting, but I got tired of the he followed her and she followed him. It should have really focused on Nora's murderous personality. Please Mr. Patterson, don't let Alex Cross go. You do your best writing with him. I really want to stay a fan."
2,"Dropped you like an anchor, but no lifeline","The book was a great read, couldn't put it down UNTIL I got close to the end and then I felt like the book fell apart. Was there a penalty for adding a few more pages and a little bit more story? It seemed the author took the 3 essential subjects in the book; Nora, the boss and the ex-wife and just threw together an ending. I felt like I was just dropped. It was very disappointing."
1,how to phone in your work,"This time Patterson had help phoning in this book, and it was not worth it.After a good start years ago, Patterson has given out such that the books published for the past five or six years have been, i want to say also rans, but they are not even that good. Buying any of the books written in this period is a complete waste of money. He cannot write decent fiction any more and the quicker he discovers that and finds a new day job, the better off we will all be.When a best selling author starts to put his name on a book along with some other author, you know he has come to the end of his string and is just using his name to sell books. If the other guy were any good at all he would be writing completely under his own name, so what you get is one exhausted writer and one hack. For this they want $20 to $30. BS."
2,"You""ve Heard It All Before","This book is very entertaining but there isn't anything original about. The basic plot is a ""black widow"" is inverstigated by an FBI agent who (guess what) has a sexual relationship with her. There's more. It is a fun book and I can see it being made into a tv movie. Read it at the beach. B book."
4,"Not my favorite, but...","I liked reading this novel, but it was a bit more graphic (re: violence) than others. I still found it hard t put it down."
4,Good book,"I chose this book because I'm a James Patterson fan and he did not disappoint. The book was a real page turner, very hard to put down."
4,Wow,True Patterson greatness! Never disappointed!Love a woman villain you love to hate and hate to hate.Thanks Mr Patterson!
3,easy reading,Patterson knocks them books out in a hurry. I liked it but usually figure out the plot quickly. I will always by his books.
3,Black Widow....chilling,"Nora Sinclair is the psychopatic black widow-killer in this book. Even though we know the murderess and the people looking for her, almost from page one, this is a good, easy, light pageturner. Perfect for your light summer reading. It IS predictable, and it DOES go on for a little longer than it should. But nevertheless, I could not put it down, and sat up half the night to finish it, and see if the good guy managed to teach that awful and unsympathetic Nora a good lesson. Don't expect too much from plot and characters, but with that in mind, it is really a page turner."
2,NO DEPTH,SIMPLE READ. APPEARS THE AUTHOR WROTE IT AS QUICKLY AS I READ IT. THE ENTIRE BOOK WAS PREDICTABLE AND LACKED SUBSTANCE.
3,This book is not what it appears to be,"389 pages, 117 chapters! That makes it a little over 3 pages per chapter! This is my first Patterson book, and I'm disappointed, and the number of pages to a chapter has the least to do with it. I would have rated this a 2.5 if there was such a rating, as I am bordering to not liking it and thinking that it was ok in some points. Story was good, and it would have been a very good read if not for the way it was related. It was written in a fashion that is more like a script, even though it alternated between first and third person narration. The movie was probably better. ""Things don't appear as they seem to be"" - a line repeated a number of times within the book - I can say the book lived up to this saying at least."
3,Patterson's lost a lot off his fastball,"At one time, James Patterson was one of the most popular writers around and his Alex Cross novels were big sellers because people liked Dr. Cross and Patterson had a gift for character development and story lines that hooked readers from the first page and didn't let go. However, Patterson's last several books have been very disappointing and this tale of a gold-digging black widow who poisons her men, then cleans out their bank accounts by wiring the funds to her offshore accounts is just plain ludicrous. The hero is a compromised FBI agent, the murderess is a psychopath with no conscience, and Patterson makes his novel more complicated than it needs to be. This book began well but Patterson got a little too cute for his own good and spoiled what could have been a diverting work of fiction. He should take a break from writing and reassess a career that seems mired in mediocrity."
4,Fast Moving with Many Twists and Turns,"I read this book in 3 days. I could not put it down. Nora was the type of character you wanted to hate, but didn't due to her traumatic childhood.As far as John...I wasn't that impressed with him until the end, when he owned up to all of his infidelities in the past and became whole again."
1,"Extremely bad, worst book ever. waste of paper and time","Fortunately I borrowed it from the library - picked it up from the shelf randomly. and it turned out to be the worst book I have ever encountered. The story is very far fetched; writing skills are very mediocre; i forced myself to finish hoping that i was proven wrong. the ending was even worse than the beginning. i decided not to read any book by this author. I hope that I can be wrong though, otherwise, it is really hard to explain the total waste of time, paper and reader's interest."
1,My first and last James Patterson book,"To see what all the brouhaha was about, I ordered this book. I can't imagine how it could be the 2005 International Thriller of the Year. Who decides that award? The format of 2 to 3 page chapters, poorly drawn characters, sacrificing character development as a plot device, and other complaints add up to a really irritating book. I won't be reading any more Patterson books anytime soon."
1,He just keeps getting worse,"Another author I used to enjoy. He has gone straight downhill. I got rooked into buying this one, after ignoring his last few books. It sure got the hype, but was really awful. Actually, I thought I had read a book before with nearly the same storyline. Do not wasted your time or your money on this one. Probably won't bother with another of his. I think he is cranking them out too fast and produces too little."
1,Just awful,"Although I have not read everything James Patterson has written, I hope that his writing doesn't get any worse than this. The banal plot (wisecracking FBI agent gets involved with beautiful ""black widow"" woman he is assigned to investigate) is just not that original. Moreover, the short chapters and unimaginative diaglogue read like the script for a bad movie. I was regretting ever starting this novel as I got halfway through it, and kicking myself for wasting the time when the book was completed. Don't waste the money on this one, folks."
1,moneymaker,patterson seems to have churned this one out just for the money. The plot has been done to death. He seems more interested in name dropping than plot development. You can tell this one was written as a movie--I'll think twice before I buy another one of his books.
2,Honeymoon's Over,"Being a long time Patterson fan, I rushed to obtain his newest. I must say that I was disappointed in his most recent novel and that I am glad ""the Honeymoon's over."" Very little thought went into the writing of the book. Loose ends remain throughout the book. Characters are shallow and underdeveloped."
3,Frustrating and disappointing,"My wife and I both just finished reading this book. My wife read it first and wanted me to read it as she was frustrated and disappointed. We're not book critics. We are just avid readers of mysteries and have read most if not all of Patterson's previous mystery novels, and liked almost all of them. If you want to know more about the story line, read some of the more extensive reviews posted here. When you get done with this book you'll have so many unanswered questions, pondering the many vague and unexplained things and events in the book. Sometimes being left ""hanging"" at the end of a book can be the signs of a well-written book. In our opinion, that's definitely not the case with Honeymoon."
5,Honeymoon,"While Honeymoon is somewhat of a departure from those used to reading the Cross novels, it captures the elements of suspense and entanglement that Patterson readers adore.I finished the book in one day and would recommend it to new Patterson readers and those who have been reading his novels since the beginning!"
2,Audio is terrible!!,"From the girl who has a speech problem,where you can't understand a word she is saying to the bad sync of the video and audio.It's just a bunch of people who still haven't ""made it"" reflecting on Mansons' success.The home movies are not that great."
1,Witness and Killer,"What would you do when a murderer comes to your apartment and sees you see the murder that he just committed? Well, a17 year old boy was asking himself that very question when he came up the elevator and the doors opened. Shortly after Le Roy saw the murder he was sent to live with his grandpa. There he learned to be a fisherman, drive a car and work the fish delivery route his grandpa ran every day. After a while the police from Chicago had tracked down Le Roy. After that he was interrogated and called into the courts as a material witness.I would not recommend this book because all it talks about was fishing and the murder. The story had a weak plot. The only people that I would recommend this book to is to someone that wants to fall asleep every time you start to read. It was very boring and I would not recommend it at all."
4,Great,"I read this to my 8th graders and they love it. They can relate to the city life and gang issues. I just love the ending as well, it caught me off guard the first time I read it and it still gets me a bit."
3,Light on plot; Strong on character,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that it was a little on the boring side (read: thin plot) -- it had some intrigue & action at the beginning & a touch at the end, but the middle seemed like a whole lot of filler material ... However, the saving grace (3 stars) was that the characters were interesting, fairly well-developed & likeable. I especially liked the Grandpa. However, the ending was a huge disappointment in that it was a cliff-hanger with no sequel in sight ... What's up with that? I could have thought of a 101 more satisfying ways to end it than what we got!"

4,"Simple, helpful, amusing discussion of logical fallacies","This is a great book. It is a pity that it is not easy to find, but it is worth the trouble. I return to this book again and again and always enjoy re-reading it.It would be great if the book could be updated with more contemporary examples, to relate to the present generation.When you read a book like this, you realise how much of what you hear and read is based on logical fallacies.Highly recommended."
3,"Entertaining, But Where is the Payoff?","I've enjoyed all three of the Otherland novels, but it seems like it could have been written in two or three novels, instead of the projected four. There is alot of wit and magic in the text, but the mystery just goes on and on and on... And the characters are not really developing; they remain static and you just get to see them do the same thing in a different scenario. Long Joseph is the most annoying character I've ever read and Xabbu's New Age psychobabble wears thin quickly. Only bother reading this series if you have about a month of free time."
2,I saw It Coming a Book Away.,"When I read the first Otherland novel I was truly transported. It was wonderful and I anxiously waited for the next book.Having waded suspiciously through the second book, I arrived at the third. 150 pages and it went on the shelf. Now I'm just annoyed. I have been strung along. I got tired of saying to myself, ""OK, something significant's going to happen."" Or, ""What I just read has developed the story in some way I don't yet understand...Tad will play on it later."" Don't get me wrong, I love an Odyssey. I just like to have the interstices more meaningful. The characters seemed to dry up in all the fluff.I'm a pretty hardy reader. Heck, I didn't even put Larry Niven's Ringworld Throne down (what an awful waste of time and trees that was). In the words of Popeye: ""I've had all I can stands and I can't stands no more!""Sorry Tad. :("
2,Might as well just re-read book II,"Nothing in the first three-quartes of this volume added much to the original story line. It seemed that we were simply being subjected to more virtual worlds and everyone being in constant peril... and perhaps a bit more violent peril than was necessary, for me, at least. I suppose that by now I should expect this repetition from an ""epic"" series, but this one seemed to initially defy the normal pattern of ""sameness"" that exists in so many others until now (I don't think I can bear to read another Robert Jordan ""Wheel of Time"" book, despite having initially enjoyed them immensely). This book ends great, and I can't wait to read book IV, but the ending should have been applied to volume II."
3,Enough Already,"The series is good so far, but not great. The third book seems to be a rehash of the second, just in different settings. Every hundred pages or so the story progresses and something new is learned, but for the most part people are running around in virtual worlds not doing too much. I've read the three books one after the other. By the mid point of the third, I was losing interest. However, I will finish the series because I really like it, but I don't think it needed to be dragged out to four huge volumes. Good story, good characters, too much filler. Once I started reading it, I wanted to finish it, but it doesn't keep me up late at night."
3,"Slow, Slower, Slowest","I started reading this series a couple of years ago. The first book, and to a lesser extent, the second, held me entranced. The lovely worlds that Tad Williams created were so interesting in the freshness and creativity.However, in this third volume, the mammoth series begins to sag under its own weight. I put the book down. I just didn't have the energy needed to keep going with it. Now, about a year later, I have picked it up again and carried on.It is a slow read."
4,Very good but getting a bit long ...,"I have to agree with the other reviewers in that it seems that the series is a bit bloated. While I hesitate to call for an end to such an engaging vision, I found myself often skimming through less interesting detail to find out what was going to happen next. By now, probably everyone knows what's going on and is longing for something else to pique the interest.I was happy to find the characters exposed a bit more. Dread, T4B, and Florimel are more real, and various love relationships have been developed. The end was surprising, both in that it wasn't the end and that more threads have been exposed for development in the next book. I can't wait to read it."
1,get to the point already,"This series grows tiresome in volume III, and more and more, it seems to be Tad Williams' way of writing about every single setting imaginable. Look, we're in an another alternate universe! These books have always wandered, but this one seems to have no point whatsoever. The first book was great, an interesting cyberpunk novel by a well-known fantasy novel. Books 2 and 3 are virtually the same novel, an endless journey through Otherland with little plot development.When I saw there is now a IV volume, I decided to stop bothering. Science Fiction greats could tell a tale in a single novel, or even in a short story. No reader should have to put up with this ""NeverEnding Story""."
2,Bloated,This is not a novel for the casual reader. This book can not stand on it's own. The author has done wonderful job of developing characters with a plausible plot line however too much time is spent in development. The author has spent so much time in character/plot development that the story itself has taken a back seat. Without reading the first part(s) in the series and without the knowledge that another novel will be added to the list this would not be worth buying. It is simply literary filler. If you love detailed characters and an above average plot line this is the book for you. If you want the above and at least part of a natual conclusion to some of participants - forget it. The book starts in the middle and never finishes. After three tries something should have been accomplished even if the story does continue for ANOTHER sequal.
1,SHADES OF RIM!,"The plot of this story sounds suspiciously like it's been lifted from an earlier novel, Rim: A Novel of Virtual Reality (HarperPrism, '94) by Alexander Besher. In Williams' 1999 tome, the ""Grail Brotherhood"" is responsible for a sinister malady that causes hundreds of children who go online to fall into a coma. In Besher's Rim, which was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in '94, a mysterious group named the ""Satori Corporation"" is responsible for a sinister malady that causes hundreds of children who go online to fall into a coma. Williams' book features Egyptian Book of the Dead-type gods running around, Besher's book wraps its theme around the Tibetan gods from the Tibetan Book of Dead. Other similarities abound, including descriptions of the children in their hospital wards etc. Too close for comfort, as far as I'm concerned. Check it out--and decide for yourselves, readers!"
2,"Drawn out and boring, boring, boring","The series began well with the first volume, but as it progressed it became obvious that it was simply a cynical moneymaking exercise by Tad Williams -- why settle for one book when you can draw the story out over numerous volumes and really cash in!I was getting tired of the draw-out storyline by the end of the second book and I really expected and hoped that this volume was going to be the last in the series. And I believe it would have been far better if it was the last book.One aspect of the story that really bored me was that most of the story seemed to be people's thoughts or tedious accounts of the group's discussions and relationships -- who cares -- get on with the story for goodness sake.But it's too late for me. This is the last Tad Williams story I intend to read..."
4,An interesting continuation,"The story continues with the heroes and heroines trapped in the otherland network and the Grail Brotherhood about to launch their long overdue masterpiece...Immortality. But the plot unfolds in a rather unexpected manner, which gives Tad Williams to go on tho a fourth book. Some may find the series too long, but the way Tad writes this story, it's better to have an ending piece after this one. Well sustained story. I would highly recommend this book."
5,Great Book,One of the greatest science-fiction books I have ever read. If you are looking for a book which will bring you into a different world then you have found it. Otherland will make you dream off into a world of virtual reality with vivid and creative characters! Take the next few days off and sit back. Have fun reading this well written book.
4,The Acorn Lands Far From The Tree,"This is an incredible story. It is rich in prose dialogue characters. It is an awesome work witch will keep you coming back.(This is not good during midterms). Williams conotiunes the story that is both a incredible fantasy. But, is frightenly real when you begin to think of what may happen in the future. This series is incredible. Not only has it been able to be original. Williams has been able to keep clear of turning his works into a set fromula. Keep up the good work."
1,It's full of errors!,"Don't know what the other reviewer was thinking about. This book is full of factual errors, including errors in the episode guides themselves. His theory that Irwin Allen was cheap doesn't hold water if you look at the budget sheets, for instance (using stock footage isn't being cheap, it's a time-tested way of making movies and television shows). I very much doubt that the author spent any time perusing the show's UCLA archives, or he would not have made the errors that he did. At least, I hope not."
5,Very good,"I received the book in a very timely manner, it was in very good condition, even better than advertised. Would definitely return again."
1,yeeeech!,I'd like to know who Miranda Wolfe was blowing to get a part in this ridiculous watch it in fast forward piece of s*** waste of time movie. I've seen better acting at the bunny ranch.
1,Purposeful falsification of modern history,"Goltz's ""diary"" would be a useful tool for anyone interested in underunderstanding the facts about Azerbaijan--an exercise made easy by the current state of the media in the US. Unfortunately for those who read this book, Mr. Goltz offers an exceedingly unbalanced account. At the expense of truth and accuracy, he has chosen a mode which not only puts the textual material in line with pro-Turkish propaganda, but also scrupulously fabricates the facts. This combination makes the book entirely unworthwhile for the person seeking a better understanding of what exactly has transpired in the conflict of Azerbaijan with its neighbors."
2,Truth according to Goltz,"It is known that no war is just, for every party that is at war thinks that its truth is the only credible one. To put the blame on on of the sides is morally wrong, and the author takes precisely such a wrong position. War crimes have marked the history of the Karabakh conflict, both Azeris and Armenians have commited atrocities. What we desperately need is an objective analysis that would portray Karabakh conflict for what it is. For an American to take a pro-Azeri position means to miss the chance for an objective look at the situation. This book leaves much more to be desired, although one cannot take away the well-written form in which material is presented."
1,A Purely Biased Book,"It is a shame that Thomas Goltz, a once respected journalist, must cave in to the pressures of the Azerbaijani and Turkish interest groups by writing such frivolous and disingenuous lies. The unabashed bias with which this book is written only exacerbates the problems with how the Nagorno Karabakh people's independence movement is told and framed in the West."
1,Big lies by Thomas Goltz,"One question that I have to Thomas Goltz is how much money was he paid by Azeri propaganda machine?I am a refugee from Karabakh, Shahumyan region, which was completely destroyed by Azeri army by fall 1992 just because It was populated by Armenians. More than 500 innocent people mostly elderly, who could not cross mountains to get refuge, were tortured and killed by Azeries. My own grandfather got killed by an artillery shell while digging potatoes in our back yard.Mr. Goltz, every person deserves the right to live free and Armenians of Karabakh are no exception. They have the right to defend their land and freedom and what they did is no different from American Revolution against colonial England.God Bless America, God Bless Armenia and INDEPENDENT Karabakh!"
2,A Ford is easier to work on than a Honda....,"Probably the biggest problem with the Hitachi c10ra3 lies in its non-standard size parts. Forget about replacing the miter gauge, or getting any sort of miter slot accessory, because the hitachi slot is 5/8"" instead of 3/4"". The screws are all metric as well (which makes sense, I guess). This wouldn't be a problem except that as far as I can tell there's NO WAY to get the blade guard/spreader on the saw without taking the thing apart. In the process of which I managed to break (yes, break in half) a couple of these crappy screws. You may say, ""But I'm not even going to use the blade guard."" Oh, but you need to, because the blade is so misaligned that you'll have kickback with just about every cut. Look, it's probably not that bad a deal, but for the trouble it's given me I might as well have bought the $99 special at the local hardware store."
3,NOT ENOUGH SAW FOR THE PRICE,"I purchase this saw after I burned by Ryobi motor out. I'd worked it hard for a number of years. I bought this saw after looking over all the available saws at a local Lowe's and choose this one as the best for price. I find it lacking in power. I just doesn't cut it. The depth of cut is weak. I was used to being able to rip a 4"" piece with my Ryobi. Wish I'd done a better job comparing before I purchased."
5,LOVE IT,He is hilarious. I love the way he delivers. I purchased the MP3 version before I bought the DVD so I was excited to actually view some parts I couldn't really get without visually seeing it.
4,Best book for teens with questions on the Catholic Church.,"Teenagers ask tough questions, and then they want short answers. Matt Pinto, not so long out of his own teenage years, delivers. This is the book I recommend be put in the hands of any teen who wants to know in brief terms what the Catholic Church is, why it believes what it believes and why it does what it does, and what difference it all makes to folks like you and me. I recommend the book strongly, and suggest it as an excellent gift idea for parents, grandparents, and Confirmation sponsors. END"
5,You have to read this!!!,This book is beyond excellent! When I bought it at first I felt kind of crazy b/c I was 22 and I thought the book was for a younger age group. Yet I heard so many good things about the book I went ahead and bought it. I then realized that this book is for all ages. The questions that are answered in this book are questions that people of all ages ask. This book would be excellent to have in bible study or CCD classes. Everyone should read this book. Catholics that read this book can better defend their faith and people from other religions who read this book will better understand what Catholics believe. This book is well written and easy to understand. You can skip around or read from beginning to end like me. Either way you won't be able to put this book down!
1,Adolescent theology,"As an experienced youth minister and religion teacher I found this book to be very inadequate. This isn't a book for adolescents on theology, it is a book with adolescent theology. It has not quite reached maturity. The answers show a lack of understanding by the author in basic moral and sacramental theology. The book is also selective in quoting the CCC. I will disagree with other reviews suggesting Mr. Pinto said aborted babies might go to hell, what he did do in that question was give the impression there is a limbo."
1,This book is full of it,"This book tells catholic teenagers that the baby who is aborted may go to hell. And the homosexual needs ""healing"" This book defines catholic as the ""true faith"" Teenagers don't need to be brainwashed."
4,Kanguru - Simple to use,great product... used by high school hockey team...used to make copies of game video for each coach after every game.
2,Disappointing,"Maybe my expectations were too high but this seemed to have almost no flavor at all. After following the instructions and ending up with a bland outcome, I added some butter and salt. Then more salt. It got saltier, but I could taste little else. Last time I checked, 'real' cheese was supposed to have flavor. I get that it's healthier than the blue box, but I would rather just have no mac & cheese at all if this is the only alternative."
2,"Might be healthy, but who wants to eat it?","What's the point in trying to serve your kids healthier mac n cheese if they won't even eat it because the taste is terrible? We've tried this multiple times, but my kids don't like it (ages 2 and 4). They are always quite excited about the bunny shapes and beg for me to make it, but after a couple bites the rest just sits in their bowl. I tried it too and thought it was gross. It doesn't taste like real cheese at all (does powdered anything ever taste like the real thing?), but has that stale/flat out-of-the-box kind of taste. When I'm in a hurry, I think I will just stick with the not-as-good-for-you blue box mac n cheese (which is delicious, even if fake-tasting, haha! :) and go to the extra effort to make my own homemade mac n cheese when I have time."
5,Delicious.,"I love this Mac & Cheese. The bunny shapes are fine, but the cheese sauce is what I buy it for. It has a bit of a ""stronger"" cheese taste than some other brands."
4,My kids love it!,"I am very hesitant to buy the Kraft Mac and Cheese from the store because I just think it's junk food. So, when I saw these, I thought I'd give it a try, and I'm glad I did. My kids really like it, and I can feel better about giving it to them knowing it isn't loaded with artificial preservatives, colors, etc. If your kids are Kraft mac and cheese addicts, they might notice a taste difference, but to my kids, it was great. I would say it pretty much tastes the same, except maybe better. Plus, it has fun bunny and carrot shapes!"
4,Great Info for those who have preemies,This book was very helpful in understanding what was happening with my baby while he was in the hospital and after I brought him home. None of my friends had preemies so they could offer advice because its a little different. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants a reference guide or information on premature babies.
5,The Premature Baby *Bible*,"This is the best resource available for parents anticipating a preemie or with a preemie recently admitted to the NICU. I say that because, as a former preemie parent, I know how hard it can be to juggle the preemie lifestyle and trying to read a book. Read this as soon as you possibly can, you won't regret it. It's got great information for doing the best you can do to help your preemie thrive. The NICU is a tough, tough world and this book will help guide you through it. This book is chock-full of information and suggestions of what YOU can do to help your preemie have the best outcome possible. Dr Sears is a God-send. I buy & give this book to every parent I know who has to face the NICU."
3,Good info but A little disappointed,"I haven't read the entire book yet but I noticed a lot of it is about when your baby is still in the hospital. I ordered it after I left...I thought there would be more about other parts of the first year. Given that we late past hospital phase, I don't think it was a good purchase for me."
4,Thorough and Informative,"Purchased this after my daughter's birth at 30 weeks 1 day gestation. It covers a wide variety of topics relating to preemies and their care. With the stress of the NICU and the fatigue of recovering from a c-section I really appreciated having an easy to read, well organized, and comprehensive resource I could refer to in order to gain a greater awareness of prematurity and help me to better discuss my daughter's care with her doctors. While this book doesn't go into great depth on every single aspect of prematurity, it's a very good introductory book which covers the most common issues preemies face. If your child has a specific issue and you're seeking in depth information on a specific condition you'd probably be better off finding a more specialized book. If you're wanting to get a handle on what you can expect during the first year with your preemie, this is the book to get."
4,Good general overview,"I bought this book on the spur of the moment after having delivered a preemie. While it helped me feel like I was participating in my baby's care by reading it, it offered little of the indepth knowlege that I needed. It is easy to reqad and provides a good general overview."
2,Damaged Goods,"I bought the book brand new. I received this book with dirty black streaks on the cover and back of the book. The lower right corner of the cover and pages were also creased. This is what ""new"" looks like? Overall the content of the book was helpful and spoke in easy to understand text. The quality I received it in is another matter."
2,Somewhat helpful,"I was excited read the book, but soon realized it speaks from only one perspective of parenting. This was Other methods are continuously criticized as examples of bad parenting. For example, the book recommends babies sleep with their mothers, and doesn't even entertain those who choose other sleeping arrangements. So I found myself skipping several sections of the book. This book reinforces an ugly trend among parents of judging how others parent and not respecting the different methods of parenting. So while the book had some good info, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Cute as a Button!,"Very soft material, looks like it will be very comfortable and warming for baby this winter! We live in the south, and I'm due December 21st, and since we're expected to have a mild winter I've had a hard time finding appropriate sweater type items to keep a newborn baby warm and this seems like just the thing for her!"
5,Fits where other boosters don't,"Most booster seats are very wide in the back. Not this one, it tappers to the back making it well over an inch narrower in the back then other seats. This makes it possible to put three booster seats next to one another, and the three kids can all buckle themselves. With other booster seats, the back edge of the booster seat ends up over the top of the seat bucket, and/or the kids can't get their hands between the booster seats to buckle themselves. This booster seat works between two regular car seats, and the child can still buckle them self. If you have to put a lot of kids in one car, this is the booster seat to get."
5,An informative book for both scholars and laypersons,"Euan Cameron has written a very informed history of the Waldensian dissent, using a lot of prime source material in such a way that it is for scholar and lay persons interested in church history a delight to read. It is well written and makes delightful reading. It is anything but a dry summary of facts. Both from the perspective of faith and history, this is a good book. It gives good unbiased information about a very interesting group of people at a turbulent time in church history. I highly do recommend it."
4,Good starter set,It appears they are no longer producing these cards. It is a good starter set for anyone interested in Pokemon. I bought this set for my 7 year old daughter to trade and collect. She loves reading the details on each one of the characters.
3,fun detective story for rutger hauer fans,"This is a fun little movie to watch if you are a Rutger Hauerfan. He's an over the hill detective who gets partnered with a beautiful young cop who knows her way around computers.... He had some nice chemistry with his partner in the movie (Tara Fitzgerald). He also had some truely comic moments(watching him try to dance made me howl with laughter!). Andrew McCarthy made a fine villian. The story line is lacking a bit (a little too predictable), but as long as you aren't looking for much substance, it is quite entertaining. I enjoyed it because the movie didn't take itself too seriously, and it looked like the actors had fun with their parts. A must for fans of Mr. Hauer! END"
3,It's a bit pricey at $94.99.,I'm having the luck of watching this movie on terrestrial TV. A quick price comparison with other Action & Adventure movies makes me wonder why this movie is so steeply priced?
5,From a physician with two children,"This well written book supports all of the latest research about parenting techniques and seems to validate our natural instincts when it comes to child rearing.Over the past 100 years or so, western culture has made a dramatic shift in how human beings raise their children. This shift towards ""parent centered parenting"" has been so pervasive that we view it as normal (even most doctors think this - probably because we seldom, if ever, receive any training in this area), but to a majority of the world and throughout our history as a species this Western approach seems backwards and foreign.The methods advocated here shift us back to parenting based on the latest scientific knoweledge and what has worked since the beginning.We have followed the advice in this book with our two children and have nothing but good things to say about it. This book should be recommended by every physician."
4,Great but...,"This book has great information and answered many of my questions. I do however think the Sears' should have invested in a good editor. I think half of the book could have been cut. Dr. Sears wasted time saying the same things over and over and sharing personal stories that didn't really add anything to the book. As a new parent, I don't have a lot of free time. I had to skim out the crap to get to the content and avoid falling asleep. Quality not quantity is important when writing anything worth reading."
3,One sided and cumbersome to read,I passed on my copy. At first I was very impressed by the AP concept. Once I had the baby I realized that a rigid approach like this doesn't work. My baby slept better on his own than in our bed. And he hated being worn the first three months. I held on to the book for factual information about growth and illness but found it too cumbersome to use a reference. I prefer the month by month format which is easier to look up.
5,A must-have book,"This has been a life saver for us. The book is clear and very easy to read, the chapters are easy to navigate and there is a wealth of information. Even if you do not subscribe to the sleep-sharing philosophy Dr. Sears is known for the book is still invaluable. Anything a new parent could want to know is covered in this book and there are also concrete examples of issues the Drs. Sears have encountered in their practice over the years to give insight and offer help. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who is expecting or already has a child and needs a great reference book to keep by the bedside."
5,Fantastic-Natural-Instinctive,"This book confirms my instinctual desire to hold (wear), co-sleep, believe/respond to cries and nurse my babies. Finding Dr. Sears' books (in addition to other AP advice) not only confirmed how I felt,it gave me and my husband confidence to do ""all the wrong things""."
3,Interesting,"I'll be a first time mom soon and this book is the first parenting book I picked out to read. It has a lot of good information on baby-care basics, but there are a lot of things that just aren't going to work for myself and my family. A lot of the parenting style (wearing your baby all day long, sharing the same bed with your baby for as long as 3 years) is taken to the extreme. Although it does tell you to find a good balance for you, your baby and your lifestyle, this book is still a little to much for me. I would tell people to read it, but also read other parenting books to find what works best for them. I'm just getting started, but I'm sure there's a better book out there."
4,Basic Principles,"This book is great for new parents, it has many of the fundamentals of a great baby book and has all the basic principles. It outlines the attachment parenting style - and frowns about the cry-it-out method, which I totally agree with. Therefore, I thought a lot of the ideas were very basic and common knowledge. However, it is a great place to start and a great read if you are sick of hearing how you are spoiling your child or shouldn't let them sleep in bed with you. This book encourages all of the principles that feel right to do as a new mom!"
2,Oh please,"I know this isn't a popular thing to say but I can't stand the Sears' advice. They seem to think the answer to all problems is either wearing your baby in a sling or breastfeeding. Gee, does it ever occur to them that most women in America have to work. Many of my friends who read this book ended up feeling guilty and that their children were going to grow up to be horrible people if they didn't breastfeed them until they are old enough to go to college. Breastfeeding is unquestionably the best way to go but the Sears' fanaticism is terrible. And, of course babies need to be close to and held by their caregivers as much as possible, but the non-stop advice to ""wear"" babies is pretty unrealistic for most people.The good advice is on developmental issues like walking, crawling, toys etc., But, get the American Pediatrics Association Guide instead for good, sound advice on raising healthy happy babies (including plenty of information and help on breastfeeding)."
3,"Good General Reference, Bad Specific Issue Resolution Guide","Although I consider myself a hybrid attachment parent (nursing on demand, sometime sling user, no co-sleeping) I felt a little overwhelmed by the attachment parenting rhetoric by the end. The basic reference portion is valuable and I liked the format of the developmental milestone section. This book does not provide the answer to the question that plagues a lot of parents- how do I get more than 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. If you are buying to answer that question buy something else (I have suggestions- I've read a lot of them) however, if you are buying to have a good general reference then this is your book."
1,"DO NOT BUY OR READ, TELL OTHER MOMS","This book is absolutely ridiculous from a nutrition stand point. If you don't want your baby to develop obesity and allergies do not follow this book. I received this as a gift and am just appalled at some of the advice. It says to give babies juice, start with fruit rather than just vegetables, and start dairy at 9-12 mo. rather than after 12 months. I'm no doctor but I've worked with children for 10 years, have one of my own, and studied nutrition and childhood development in college. From my experience this advice could lead to serious consequences, that will form your children's taste and tolerance for the rest of their lives."
1,Am I a Bad Mother?,"I bought this book on the suggestion of a friend who has two children. I should have read the negative reviews more closely. According to Dr. Sears I would be a bad mother (or at least not as good a parent as he is).Dr. Sears advocates breastfeeding to the EXTREME. I tried desperately to breastfeed. I had an emergency C-section, my baby had jaundice (which required him to have formula in the hospital), and my milk never came in. I tried everything--went to the lactation consultants, took pills, etc. but my body just wasn't made for breastfeeding. Reading his book made me feel SO incredibly guilty.Despite the breastfeeding, most of the material I disagreed with. (His attachment parenting was also too extreme for me.) It may be too early to tell, but I think my baby is turning out just fine -- without following Dr. Sears' advice."
2,Needs more info on babies!,"I'm sorry, I expected more from the Sears couple. It says 'The Baby Book', but it focuses more on toddlers I think. Very little information for babies in there. I wanted them to tell me how much of solid food to give to my baby, I think they gave like a teeny little paragraph on what was safe. VERY little weaning info, as they are all for nursing your child through college. Don't get me wrong, I am having a grand nursing experience with my daughter, but some people cannot wait until a child naturally weans unfortunately, and they don't really want to tell you that. Had I known how big they were with sleeping and nursing with your child, I probably would've opted for another book..."
5,Fabulous Book - Very Sound Biblically and Psychologically,"As a Christian Counselor, I wholeheartedly recommend this book! You will be amazed at how Dr. Sears hits the nail on the head and gives parenting advice that you will use for years and years to come!"
5,VERY HELPFUL,This might be one of the most helpful books I've read while I'm pregnant. I definitely recommend it!
4,Eager for a revision,"Recently purchased as a gift for an expectant mother relative based on the recommendation of my daughter, a mother of two, I wish there was a more recent edition."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to get some insightful and practical information about rearing a child in the early years. I have so far been disappointed by this book. I think it has high expectations on motherhood and their solutions where neither practical, nor very insightful. The author calls on his wife's experience a lot and I didn't feel that her experiences were typical."
2,Out of this world!,"The book's recommendations require impossible time commitment from both mother and father. ""Go nap with you baby during the day"" indeed. The health advice is reasonable, but the sleep issues and social parenting are completely out of sync with a modern, two working parents and no grannies family."
2,"Some good basics, with a helping of guilt","This book has some great stuff in it- the basics of how to carry a baby in a sling, how to breastfeed, growth charts, tips on gentle discipline- but in general, the advice segments of this book are judgmental, not well-balanced, and unreferenced. Sears & Sears make you feel guilty for trying any approach other than the ""Attachment Parenting"" style they espouse.I found Sears & Sears to be particularly unhelpful when it came to infant sleep. Their suggestions for how to get a baby to sleep longer at night, such as using all-cotton sleepwear and co-sleeping, are probably great for easy babies with extremely mellow temperaments. But what happens if your baby does not respond to quick fixes? Sears & Sears only suggest an increased level of responsiveness, and insinuate that resorting to any ""sleep training"" method risk doing permanent psychological damage to their child, something which is not true, and quite unfair to a desperately sleep-deprived parent."
5,love this book,"I love this book. I already had a copy, but bought this one for my cousin who just had a baby and needed more information on breastfeeding. great reference."
5,One of my favorite gifts to give to expectant parents!,"The first two weeks after my son's birth, this book was my constant companion. It answered questions when I didn't know what to do, and reassured me that I was right when I did know! The Sears' are supportive and positive and clearly love children. This is the first book I go to now, 19 months later, when my son isn't feeling well, or for developmental advice. A great addition to any parent's library."
1,Does your child sleep throught the night?,"Was agnostic on the whole sleep thing when I was parentless. While pregnant I did an informal survey. Everyone I know who slept with their baby had some kind of sleep problems down the road. They did not necessarily see the connection between the two but I definitely saw the correlation. My curiosity was piqued.Unfortunately this has become a PC hot topic. Which is probably why Marc Weissbluth diplomatically skirts the issue in his brilliant sleep book. If your child is older than 4 months and is not sleeping 12 hours straight at night WITHOUT feeding, read the Weissbluth book.I could not tell you why it works, all I know is that I am very well rested and so is my baby. Good enough for me.Burton White and Barton Schmidt books are also excellent for understanding a baby's development (White) and practical illness/problem answers (Schmidt). Both are very well regarded in the pediatric medicine field."
1,Not for those with lactation issues,"This book will basically make you feel like the worst person on the planet if you are not breastfeeding your child for any reason. I wonder if Dr Sears has any idea how awful he makes moms with lactation issues feel? This book made me cry way too many times. Don't buy this book if you have milk supply issues, if you are adopting, if you are taking a drug that will make you unable to breastfeed, or if you will not be breastfeeding for any other reason."
3,DESIGNED FOR FIRST-TIME PARENT(S),"William and Martha Sears did a very good job here. This book is handy; and very easy to understand. It takes parents through the infancy of their child. However, its biggest undoing is that the information it provided are so basic and elementary that anyone with previous childcare experience can comfortably do without it. Thus, if you have a fair knowledge of child-nursing, it will be more rewarding to leave this book and invest on a moderately advanced one.The audience of this book are inexperienced couples who are expecting (or just had) their first baby. If you fall into this group, don't hesitate to grab it. There are chances that every tutorial you need are in it. But be aware, this book has not been updated since 1993!"
1,Not for me or my kids,"I rarely give anything one star, but I threw this book away. Short story, a friend gave me this book before my first baby was born. My friend was an attachment parent, and that just isn't my style. I'm glad Dr. Sears and his wife found a style that worked for them, and that other parents find that useful, but I would literally lose my mind parenting that way. My kids would only see me through the small glass window of my inpatient psychiatric room.What I particularly resent about this book is how Dr. Sears traces so many childhood maladies back to lack of breastfeeding, co-sleeping, nighttime parenting, skin-to-skin contact, etc. Again, this works for some people, but not me. Besides, inpatient psych units are expensive.My bible for taking care of my kids is the American Academy of Pediatrics: Caring For Your Young Baby and Child. Solid, middle of the road medical advice."
5,Must-have for first time parents,"This book covers everything you need to know about taking care of your baby in a sensitive, caring manner. Unlike other baby training books that take the medical or parents' perspective, this book advocates care that is best for baby, such as breastfeeding, baby wearing, comforting a high-needs baby, etc. A must-have for attachment parenting supporters."
2,"I wish I could, BUT","I think this book is written for ideal circumstances. I was given this book before my daughter was born and planned to follow it to the letter. Unfortunately, at 4 months I felt like a failure as a parent because what they said was not working for my daughter and I was feeling exhausted. I had to find another way ..."
5,Wish I Had it From the Get-Go,"It was amazing to me when I picked up this book and discovered that it confirmed that the way I intuitively wanted to parent was OKAY. In fact, it was natural and wonderful. I no longer had to worry about what the ""experts"" were saying (some contradicted my way of thinking entirely, which made me worry that I was doing the wrong things). I found support for my natural parenting style here, as well as a good reference for medical, developmental, and behavioral factors in my baby's upbringing. The practical nighttime amd baby-wearing tips are not in any other books I found and were very useful. I learned that if you know and bond with your baby, you will always know what he/she needs. This book helps teach you to bond with your baby. It is wonderful and will be the gift I give at every shower from now on!"
5,This just worked for us.,"Before having my daughter I had turned my nose up at the idea of attachment parenting, but I picked up the book during my pregnancy, along with many other parenting and baby books and this has been the one that I find myself returning to again and again.It's an easy book to reach for when you have specific needs and so far has provided us with a lot of great information. We've used it to properly treat common illnesses, to be more strategic about how we're responding to our daughter's cues and needs and it's helped us to realize that our baby has unique needs and we just need to adapt. It just makes sense.I especially like the chapters on sleeping and development milestones."
2,"Some helpful information, but too preachy.","This book has some good information, but gets to involved in preaching about baby wearing and breastfeeding along with other subjects. I do nurse my baby and believe it should be continued as long as mutually desired, but the authors make me feel like I am doing something wrong if I do not totally agree with them. They make me feel like I am being a bad mother if I do not follow their suggestions. The authors keep repeating themselves and do not give you the feeling that it is okay if you do not agree with them."
2,"Uneven, some very odd and autocratic thinking","While some of the suggestions in this book are helpful, the Sears philosophy seems to be one autocracy, ""Do it THIS way and no other is valid."" This is despite the claim that parenting each child is a unique and individual experience. Strange, then, that Sears believes that his steps are the only that can fully meet the needs of a child.Here's a radical idea for parents, don't be an ""Attached Parent"" (AP), or an (insert descriptor here) parent, simply be a parent who parents your child in a way that allows your family to function happily, healthfully and in the best way possible."
2,Too opinionated,"I am a new expectant mom and I bought this book, as well as the Sears' Breastfeeding book, after several friends recommended them. The more I read both of them the more frustrated I have become at what seems like the authors' lack of tolerance for various approaches to parenting. They seem to promote one ""right way"" of doing things, and that's ""their"" way. I'm surprised and disappointed that such an experienced and well respected pediatrician would not provide more than one approach or opinion on the various aspects of parenting and childrearing. I would not recommend this book, especially for a new parent, if you want to keep an open mind about newborn topics."
1,Awful.... just awful,"This book is a joke.It's basically one guys view on how you should raise your child that is written as if there's a ton of ""evidence"" and ""studies"" to show how right he is. The problem is, he never says what those studies are, or where the opinions come from so you can only conclude that they're his personal opinions. This is fine except he never says it's just his opinion!My favorite part is the section where he tells the story of a couple who don't practice his methods but instead have the child sleep in their own bed and don't respond to their every cry within 10 seconds. He goes on to say how the parents didn't have a tight relationship with the child as he grew and later the kid got into trouble.He tells it as if the whole issue started because they didn't respond as he thought they should when the kid was a baby!"
3,Not As Good As Other Resources,"I asked for this book after my daughter was born, but never really got much use out of it as I did some others. It didn't seem to be as detailed on some topics and on other topics, I didn't always agree with the philosophy. If you are looking for only a few books to use as a reference with a new baby, I would suggest alternatively ""What To Expect The First Year"" and ""Your Baby Week by Week"" which I ended up using much more."
1,"Dumbed-down, Insulting Book filled with Scare Tactics","If you enjoy being talked to like you're a brainless, intuitionless human being and you respond well to scare tactics then this book is for you. It's dumbed down so much that I'm quite sure even a baby would find it insulting.This book is all about doing it one way and criticizing all other methods. According to Sears, their way is the ONLY way to raise a healthy, happy, adjusted child. I know two couples who followed this book religiously and their children are the antithesis to independent, adjusted, happy children (refusing to eat, refusing to sleep, crying incessantly when mom is busy, developmenally delayed, etc etc). We, on the other hand, stopped following this book and our 5 month old is smart (says Mama already), physically advanced (sits unassisted, rolls over, and stands up), goes to bed without fussing, sleeps all night, laughs and smiles constantly and eats like a champ. Don't buy this book new, buy my hardly-used copy!"
3,Be sure to pick and choose from this book,"This book has very good advice, but it can also lead you desperately astray. Much of the advice seems to come from a liberal view of parenting. One that may not fit with your personal beliefs. If that is the case, then don't listen to that section of the book. After four months of following this book closely, we realized that our son was beginning to manipulate us with his protest crying. We knew that he should have been sleeping better than he was. After several weeks of using advice from Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth our child was sleeping through the night. Following this book, he probably would not be sleeping through the night yet. In addition, by following this book we probably prolonged the crying that we had using Weissbluth's advice."
4,I learned a lot,"I am a pretty mainstream mom in a lot of ways, but after babywising my way through two infanthoods, I was ready to make some changes.The Baby Book encouraged me to listen to my mother's heart. It also showed me that I can sleep with my baby, nurse through toddlerhood, and wear a sling IF I WANT TO, and if it's best for both the baby and our family.The Baby Book isn't just for parents who want to adhere strictly to all the Sears' ideas but would be useful to anyone who isn't already married to some exclusive parenting dogma. Use what works and disregard the rest. Both breast and bottle parents can learn from this resource (the Searses in fact bottle-fed their youngest).I find it interesting that this book garners criticism from opposite ends of the spectrum. I think that is a sign of balance."
4,A very helpful and thorough book.,"This is a huge book that covers every topic possible for the first two years. Contains tons of charts, pictures, Q&As,lists and short tips on everyday issues. Covers both medicial and developmental issues.I only gave it four stars because it is very biased towards attachment parenting ideals and makes parents feel guilty if they don't follow it 100% - such as co-sleeping, breastfeeding, or (heaven forbid!) being a working mother. Also, it's a bit confusing in organization and can be hard to find what you're looking for.Also recommended: The No-Cry Sleep Solution, Gentle Baby Care and Baby Signs."
4,"Very good how to book, with an ax to grind","This is a very worthwhile baby book with one flaw. It is wonderful as a ""how to"" book for the mechanics of parenting (how do I take the baby's temperature, etc), but its utility is somewhat degraded by the fact that the authors take a very strong editorial stance on their philosophy of parenting. Often it this results in the book feeling somewhat stringent and judgemental and not as comforting as say, Dr. Spock's book.As a first time parent I have found it very useful, but the editorial tone annoys me to no end. Despite that, I do find myself turning to it often."
4,Only one problem with the kindle version...,"My mother gave me this book to use as a refernce upon the birth of my baby, but it was hard to find time to read it while trying to recover and take care of a newborn. When I finally got around to looking through it, I found a million tips on baby care and parenting that I had had to learn the hard way; if only I'd read this book BEFORE giving birth!I finally got the kindle version so that I could read it while nursing, and I'm so glad I did. Now I tell all my pregnant friends about this must-have book and urge them to read it before the baby arrives.The only problem with the kindle version is that the charts and graphs, which are so helpful in the print edition, are next to impossible to read on kindle, and the lists are improperly formatted on the kindle to appear as unpunctuated paragraphs. It's such a shame. I'm glad I have the print version for reference."
1,I thought this book would be wonderful....,"but I ended up throwing it away in frustration. Nothing in this book seemed to work and my baby constantly seemed out of sorts and fussy. Finally, at the advice of my pediatrician, I put him on a flexible schedule of eating and sleeping and playtime and he is thriving. He sleeps through the night, eats well and is a happy, easy-going child. My little one is so interested in everything around him that he would never sleep unless I had trained him to (as outlined in tne American Academy of Pediatric Caring for your Child from Birth to Five years.) I'm not sure how you can raise a child without ever letting him cry a little or ever putting him down. Yes, at certain times of the day, I did carry him (I used a Baby Bjorn rather than a sling)and that really soothed him, but I don't think it is necessary to always carry him. Maybe this works for some families, but our family needed a little structure for the good of the whole family."
5,Great Parenting Produces Healthy Adults,"Don't listen to those nonsense reviews below. This book was a lifesaver for me when my child was a newborn. It taught me all the things that should have been passed down throughout the generations, but our culture has thrown out the window. My baby had a dairy sensitvity which made him very high-needs. If it hadn't been for The Baby Book I would have lost my mind and not have bonded with my baby so well.The book gives great suggestions for how mother and father can bond with the baby. Now wonder Dr. Phil HIGHLY RECOMMENDED this book on his show this year and said keep it handy and refer to it often. If only we had more pediatricians like Dr. Sears................."
3,"Good info, guilt-trips, all mixed together","Some info in this book is really great, but lurking in sidebars and stories are some really serious guilt trips that I'm sure will inspire many a women's study major of the future. For instance, the authors say several times that any sleep arrangement that works for you is OK, but then refer to the ""bars"" of the crib as if they're prison bars. There's the same sort of mixed messages about moms working outside the home and bottlefeeding. Read this one with the same skepticism you'd give any book that makes a lot of value judgements."
2,not for everyone,"After reading several books on parenting, I feel that this book isn't for everyone. I think there should be some middle ground between schedule feedings and attachment. The information in here seems a little outdated as well. If you are a working mom, this may not be the book for you. My recommendation is to read a few books on different approaches and find what works for you and your baby. My baby started sleeping through the night at 12 weeks and has slept in her crib from day one. She is a happy little girl and is more of a schedule baby. Does this work for every baby? Maybe not, but it worked for her:)"
5,Fantastic book - great child rearing guide,"I have just had my 3rd child and have been using this book as my child rearing guide for the past 4 years. What I loved most is the focus that is given on doing what is best for the kids. How to help them become happy, independant children. Co-sleeping is the best thing we did with our 1st baby. She left our bed when she was ready, which was just about when we were ready. Our 2nd baby was happier sleeping alone, so we let her. With out third; he is in bed with us right now - at 7 weeks old. We'll let him decide if he wants to continue that or not."
5,A working mom who LOVED this book,"I'm a working mom and I loved this book! I did think that the Sears's sometimes gave short shrift to dads--I think Dad should be a working moms best ally--but overall I think the book is intelligent, balanced and a refreshing alternative to much that is out there. So many parenting guides assume that the way we've always done things is the best way and the Sears book gives you permission to listen, deeply to what is in your heart as a parent. It IS possible to nurse all night, breastfeed for 6 months, practice ""attachment parenting"" and still hold down a job. It does require thoughtfulness, flexibility and creativity and I believe if this book is read with an open, non-defensive mind it can help provide the tools parents need to accomplish this rewarding goal. When we told my husband's grandmother that we were allowing our newborn to sleep with us she heartily endorsed our decision. Perhaps Sears' ideas are not really all that new!"
4,Great Book But Use Your Own Judgement,"I first ran across this book with my 1st son, who just turned 10, and bought it again when I found I was pregnant with the 2nd, he's 4 1/2 months old now. Quite simply this book works for me but it may not be for everyone.On Parenting Styles - Attachment ParentingLike any book you have to take what is presented and make it work for you... you don't have to follow this book to the letter to be a ""good"" parent. Attachment parenting to me is being sensitive to your baby and their needs... aka cries in the early days. You don't have to breastfeed, wear your baby, co-sleep, etc. in order to do this, you do get additional bonding time if you do, but by just paying attention to your baby you'll bond just fine. Do what works for you, that's the message I got from this book.On Everything ElseThis book is packed with helpful information from diaper rashes to teething to solids and development."
5,"If you buy one ""Baby How-To"" book, make it this one.","Buy this book and keep it on the shelf for reference! This is the one book I go back to time and time again for all my raising babies questions. From Fevers to Feeding, how to play with baby, how to WEAR your baby in a sling, developmental stages, etc. I started out getting it at the library and realized it was the ONE book I needed to BUY so I could refer back to it when necessary and it's proved its worth!"
4,"Great book, but don't let it make you feel guilty","In case you aren't familiar with Dr. Sears - he has raised eight children. I would call him an expert based on that alone. However, he does have some very conservative ideas on raising children. If you are a parent who has to return to work or chooses not to breastfeed, you might not want to read this book. Almost everything is centered around being there for your child 24-7 and breastfeeding. It could make you feel guilty. Sure, he addresses the return to work stuff and formula feeding, but I almost felt like if I didn't breastfeed and did go back to work, I ran the risk of being a horrible parent. That being said, he does have some wonderful ideas, the book is up to date with current happenings and is a wealth of information."
5,OUTSTANDING RESOURCE FOR PARENTS!,"With a 16-month-old, I've read my share of how-to baby books. This book is by far the *BEST*. I have borrowed it from the library twice, renewed it twice, borrowed it from friends and now it is time for my own copy! Don't let nay-sayers fool you. This book is a must for BOTH parents and will provide you with everything you need to know about how to lovingly and competently care for your baby."
4,Depends on your point of view...,"I am a first-time mother and have found this book helpful. I especially like the parts that focus on general health-- the first time I felt a little cyst on the back of my baby's head, I flipped out until I read it was normal in this book (didn't find this info in my other baby books!). However, one thing I don't like about this book is that it seems to bring up questions parents ask without fully answering them except for telling you to practice attachment parenting. That's fine, but I'd like some other realistic options to supplement that. All in all, a valuable book that makes you really feel good about being a parent."
5,the best book I've seen!,"I am extremely impressed by this book. I have used this book too many times to count with my two-year old, and I'm glad I have it now with my two-month old. Any time I have questions, I've been successful finding the information I've needed in The Baby Book. It has helped me diagnose problems such as yeast rashes, thrush, and roseola before I've taken the baby to the pediatrician. Even though there is a large stress on attachment parenting (perhaps too much for some), it is an excellent resource for parents. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has or will have a baby in the near future."
1,book sucks,"This is one of the worst books I have ever bought. When it comes to parenting, I would like to see some studies about a certain matter. However, this book only talks about the doctor and his nurse wife's opinions on parenting through their practice. Some of the methods they are supporting are really discouraged by psychologists and considered dangerous sometimes. So if you are looking for a good way to parent your baby do NOT buy this book, as the dangerous after math to their methods do NOT appear until your children are in their teens."
2,Not the book for career women and contemporary fathers,"Society has changed so much in the past 2 decades in regard to women and careers and the role of fathers in childcare. Dr. Sears' book has many excellent areas but it is not up to date in regard to these societal issues which are so important to the contemporary family and up-to-date parenting. I found a book called ""Our Baby:The First Year"" which acknowledges these important issues and goes well beyond it. I would highly recommend this new (1997) book for any new family."
3,Good info and ideas infused with guilt,"This book was invaluable in some ways after my daughter was born. The parts I remember being most helpful were the breastfeeding techniques, first foods and nutritional information, and illnesses. I like the intuitive ideas presented, as there is more of an emphasis on trusting your instincts as a parent than other mainstream parenting books out there.There is an undertone of guilt in this book and other Sears books that I don't like at all. Not all of us are in families with two parents, daycare is not always a choice but a necessity, and not all aspects of Attachment Parenting work for every family.While I thought this book was very useful in the basics of baby care and nutrition, I don't appreciate the condescending attitude woven through the book. Unfortunately, in other Sears books I have explored since I have found the same thing. I appreciate the author of a parenting book to at least assume the parent is trying their best."
5,The only book you need!,No need to buy the pregnancy book or the others in the Sears collection. This book has enough information on most of the topics you need to be knowledgable of. Easy reading and a great consultation book after your baby is born.
4,"Good, Quaility information","Unlike some of the other reviewers, I know that I need to pull bits of info from books and apply it to my life as I choose. Dr. Sears is strongly opinionated about slings and co-sleeping, so the sling didn't work for us, big deal...co-sleeping has worked like a charm. I don't feel guilty or like a ""failure"" because I have a mind of my own and can decide what is right for us.The book does a wonderful job of suggesting different ways of handling the difficult situations that arise as a new parent as well as quality nutrition infomation to start your child on the right foot with eating habits.I highly recommend this book as an addition to a new parents library."
2,Attachment Parenting,"This book focuses on Attachment Parenting and I was looking for a more factual book on the development of a baby. I felt this book was too focused on what the authors felt was their opinon on good parenting rather than medical facts and a guide to things like how much too feed your baby at certain weights, etc."
2,Some useful information - technique not for me,"There was some useful information in the book, but it was too buried in the attachment parenting lectures. And they aren't statements, they're lectures. The book also does a good job of making you feel like if you don't practice the attachment parenting style they preach, you are a bad parent and condemning your kid to a horrible life. Great message to send to first time parents - make them completely doubt themselves. Yeah.There is so much more useful information in What to Expect."
5,The natural way to raise a baby,"In today's world we need ideas to raise children who are compassionate, caring and connected. The ideas in this book will help you raise a child like this. The best part is that it is all common sense and feels natural and right. Often times we are swayed by the advice of others against doing those things that feel right to us. Dr. Sears gives you ""permission"" to follow your own mind and do things your way. The book has good advice on nearly every topic that comes up. I'd also recommend The No-Cry Sleep Solution and The Continuum Concept."
4,Good and thick book!,"Bought this book as I also believe in attachment parenting.I am still reading it as the book is extremely thick.It covers almost all areas. What I like most about this book as opposed to those ""Schedule and Routine training books"" is that it doesnt make you feel guilty about wanting to co-sleep with your baby. It felt natural to me and this book actually encourages it.A lot of the things like attending to your baby when he cries and carrying your baby when he wants to be held are encouraged. Other books usually tell you that you are spoiling a child but what does a new baby know about spoiling? They just want to feel loved and secure. I feel a lot more confident about my natural way of parenting.My baby is contented and so am I.Great book.Good buy. Worth every cent. The Dr.Sears website is also excellent."
5,Best Resource Around,This is hands down the best book to guide parents. I can't tell you how many times it has helped us as we learn how to care for a newborn/baby. Organization is intuitive and advice is clear and concise. Everything you need to know is in the book.
5,Very helpful book for new mothers.,This book is far better than what to expect during the first year. It tells me the symptoms and a diagnosis before her doctors tell me what is wrong. It is very detailed and informative.
4,Excellent Resource Guide - the parent's ped. book for today!,The style advocated by Sears matches development and brain research. It is a great resource for the intelligent parent that wants to take time to build a relationship with their children.Perfect encyclopedia of tips on handling problems for first time parents. A must buy.
1,Kindle version is broken - get the paper book,"The Sears' writing style depends heavily on bullet points, lists, and sidebars, but the formatting does not properly come through in the Kindle edition. For example, a bulleted list in the book comes across as a run-on unpunctuated sentence on Kindle. Also, since the 300+ book only has a table of contents and not an index, it is difficult to navigate on Kindle. Searching is completely useless, as common terms are used hundreds of times throughout the book -- it's sad to say, but flipping through physical pages is more efficient.If you want to buy this book, read it cover-to-cover, and put it away, then the Kindle edition may be OK for you. But, if you want to use it as a reference, buy the book, not the Kindle edition."
5,The Only Baby Book To Buy! A Guiding Light In The Dark,"Dr. and Mrs. Sears seem to be the only people in the pediatric world who know anything about babies, and who actually care about what is best for them, rather than ways for selfish parents to make excuses for doing what they prefer to do. This book contains information in every catagory and is sooooo helpful. ... I cannot stress enough that Dr. Sears has true, proven research as well as experience and good instincts to back up all of his information. The Sears have 6 healthy, well balanced children to show as examples. Until I had a baby I basically trusted doctors, but I have learned that pediatrics is another world altogether. The patients can't speak for themselves, or defend themselves from doctors, who only a short time ago, didn't even use anesthesia for surgery on babies. God bless Dr. and Mrs. Sears!"
1,"Circumcision stance: genital integrity is not about ""sameness""","Snippet: ""Since little boys do sometimes compare the styles of their penis, many parents feel that sameness is important among brothers.""The Baby Book teaches that if siblings have different colors of skin, we should paint them the same color so they don't have questions. In fact, if we have sons and daughters, we should just amputate all external genitalia so that they don't ever ask why they look different, since ""sameness is important"". 5 stars to Sears and Sears. And let's hope one of the siblings doesn't loose a hand, or all the others will get it clipped as well."
2,A little disappointing...,"I received this book as a gift while I was pregnant, and put it away until the baby was born. Towards the end of my pregnancy I attended a newborn-care class at my hospital, where the teacher highly recommended this book. Once the baby and I came home from the hospital, I pulled The Baby Book out and gave it a try.As a new mother, I found the chapters fairly long and involved. I just didn't have that much time to sift through the information to find what I needed.There seemed to be a real tilt towards stay-at-home mothers. I would love to be able to afford to stay home with my child, but unfortunately it's just not possible.I'm sure many people will love this book. I just preferred What to Expect the First Year. It gives a month-by-month breakdown of just what to expect with your newborn. I'm looking forward to reading What to Expect the Toddler Years after I finish this one."
5,Fantastic book. Reaffirms mother's intuition,"This book is a great reference book. It includes chapters on breastfeeding, bottle feading, development, illnesses and attachment parenting. It is not preachy and allows people to pick and choose from their suggestions to find what works best for your baby. Not all ideas from this book will work, just like not all the ideas your mom has will work. Each baby is an individual and it is up to the parent's to figure out what is best of the their child. This book will help you learn to trust your own instincts and feel right about whatever method of parenting you use. Plus it has ideas and guidelines for introducing foods and stimulating toys and playtime for your children. This is a nice big book that replaced all my other parenting books. I found it to be much more informative and less ""new age"" as compared to my ""What to expect the first years"" book."
5,Great Baby Advice Book,"I've been reading a lot of the bad reviews regarding this book and those bad reviews centered on the fact that the Sears are advocates of attachment parenting. Attachment parenting is not something for everyone. Yet, even if it is not for you this book is still an awesome ""baby bible"". Everything that I needed to know regarding my firstborn was in this book. I rarely had to take my daughter to the doctor for any ailment and when I did I was already knowledgeable regarding the specific situation because of the information presented in this book. I can't believe that so many people would give this book 1 star because of the attachment parenting portion. If you want a book that provides a wealth of knowledge about your baby from birth to age 2, then this is your go-to guide. I give this book to any friend who is having a baby and they love it!! If you want to learn more about attachment parenting, then this is your go-to guide. Overall, A++++"
3,"OK, but not friendly to working mom's...","This book seems to have some great advice at times, but the author's attitude towards working mothers is extremely biased against them. It made me question if he has ever had to face reality, financial or otherwise, and therefore made his other assumptions questionable. He is also pro-family bed, which is not a concept in which everyone is in favor. If you can overlook these two biases, it is a pretty good book."
5,Wonderful Resource!,"Finally, a parenting style that doesn't make me cringe! This book was so inspiring and helpful that I recommend it to all of my patients (I'm a labor and delivery RN), as well as give it out for baby showers. The Sears' books are always enlightening and truely helpful; but more than that, they come from a place of love. Anyone who practices the parenting style they suggest can only be contributing to world peace and guiding our young family members as loving and compassionate citizens."
3,Made me feel guilty!,"I loved Dr. Sears's pregnancy books, but this baby book made me feel a little guilty sometimes. I enjoyed the baby wearing information and agree with the general idea of attachment parenting; I just couldn't do all of it and really wanted to. Even though I wanted to sleep with my baby, it never seemed to work.There is a great variety of information that really is useful for the two years it claims to be a guide for. I especially find myself turning to this book for nutrition information and the developmental charts.On the whole I like the book, but prefer Penelope Leach's book because it has a better variety of options presented from which the reader can choose. Dr. Sears advocates a certain way of doing things, which is fine, but I think a better choice, at least for a gift to someone expecting, is a book that presents more options for the new mother."
2,"pro-baby yes, but anti-mom","Clearly the authors love babies. They'll reassure you that co-sleeping is great, and that you shouldn't feel guilty about picking up your baby every time she cries. But their advice is unrealistic and guilt producing. First, how many people can take baby to work? Then, they give an example of how Mom Sears delays a feeding for a few minutes and guiltily endures baby's anger which lasts throughout the feeding, and learns her lesson--never make baby wait again! Bad, bad Mommy! The reality is, not all of us can immediately cater to every need of an infant at all times. If you conceive of an identity outside of being a mom, or if you ever have to balance baby's long-term needs (like having a roof over his head) against the short term ones (he doesn't want you to leave him and go to work) you will probably find Sears extremely guilt-inducing."
5,This is THE book,"It is informative! It leans towards the gentler side of parenting which we agree with. Before we had our little one we were determined that we ran the house and he would acclimate. Once I looked in those little eyes it was a different story. i wanted his little life to be as safe and warm as is possible. that is basically what this book illustrates; how to be a safe place for your baby...not just to have a baby that survives, but thrives."
3,Good Book,"This book has been helpful, but I wish I would have gotton one more like the pregnancy books that I got were you read from week to week. I find it a little overwhelming with all the information. It is a good reference when you have a specific question."
4,Very helpful,As a first time mother I have found this book to be a very helpful reference to have on hand.
4,This was the best out of all I read,"I am a new parent who needed to know everything from step one. I read five or six books, and this was the most helpful, especially if you are planning on nursing. I am not into attachment parenting or co-sleeping (a bassinette by the bed: OK. Baby sleeping in parents bed after the age of five months or so: Not my thing) and I still considered this book the most informative."
4,The Baby Book,"Was amazed at how quickly it was delivered. The cover was slightly dirty and the book was worn out but all in all, a good buy for a buck something."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,I'm a new first time mom and my daughter is now 3 months old. My husband and I have looked in this book for several things. It has both questions from other parents with answers from Dr. Sears and also information on it's own.Very handy and great for us so far.
3,Dr Sears gives criticism a new name,"I was unable to breastfeed my daughter because I didn't produce enough milk. it was HEART breaking to me, and Dr Sears seems pretty much set against bottle feeding. His views are very personal, not professional. MOst Dr's( at least the ones I've spoken to personally) are against the things he suggests. You have to be strong willed to read and refer to this book, I am not I guess because alot of things he says, offended me and my ways of raising my daughter- made me feel inadequate. Sorry Dr Sears =( This book will remain in the Yard Sale box."
3,A very opinionated book,"While there is great information in the book, Sears has his way of child rearing and I felt like if you didn't choose his way then you were doing it wrong. The book made me nervous that I would not do things right if I did not do it his way. I would not recommend this book."
3,Its overrated,"I think it has some good info but It pushes breastfeeding too much ( I am a bf mamma tho) also a lot of the info seems outdated. I prefer the ""what to expect..."" book, its better in my opinon"
2,"Some good points, real breast feeding nazi","I thought this book was informative but the breast feeding emphasis was way over the top. Not everyone is meant to breastfeed their kid and he is super super into it. He even has an illustration of a breastfeeding contraption for an adopted child. To me, he implies if you don't BF you'll never bond w/ your kid. He is also a little over the top with other ideas (family bed, love nest)."
2,Good info if you are able ot Breastfeed,"I thougth I would enjoy this book, (i am a new mother of twin boys) however if you don't or are unable to breastfeed this books makes you feel like you are doing some major harm to your child. For medical reasons I was unable to breastfeed and this book just made me feel worse. I believe that we could do a lot worse things to our children then to not breastfeed them.It made it worse for me."
5,My reference bible for the first year!,"The has been our go-to reference in the first year of our daughter's life. My natural instincts told me that the ""cry it out"" method was not for me, and this book was very affirming. The beauty of Dr. Sears is that he approaches childrearing from a holistic perspective - find what's best for you and works for your family. And don't worry about what anyone else says! In 12 months, we have lost maybe a total of 10 hours of sleep following the advice in this book - and that's after our baby was (mis)diagnosed with colic at 2 months. We have a happy, healthy, baby who rarely cries, and is a great sleeper and great eater. I recommend it to all my friends who are having children."
1,was Used NOT New,Not happy at all. Received a book advertised as NEW but it was USED- and had a personally inscribed message in the front page to someone else!I bought this book as a gift and am just glad I noticed the inscription before I gave it away.Extremely dissatisfied.
1,unrealistic,"Dr. Sears stresses throughout the book that the crib is so unimportant, and the baby should sleep in the parents' bed. Also, Dr. Sears stresses to carry the baby all day long in a sling. These are two ridiculous ways to raise your baby and no one should practice this advice."
1,"MOST JUDGMENTAL, FANATICAL BOOK EVER WRITTEN","I wish I could give NEGATIVE 5 stars. He actually writes that if you have post partum depression and need medication, you probably shouldn't take it because then you can't breastfeed and that would make you more depressed because breastfed babies are ""better citizens."" What a load of crap! First, telling someone with PPD to hesitate to get treatment - is outrageous. Second, saying that breastfeeding is the only way to go (he basically says that) is narrowminded and judgmental. This man should be arrested."
2,Too Much Attitude,"I read the other reviews that said this book was geared to attachment parenting. I thought, no big deal, I'd skip those parts and focus on the other advice. Well, it seems like every single section basically says do it this attachment parenting way if you want your child to be happy and healthy. It really pervades all parts of the book. I expected some of it, but not this much. My estimate is that 50% of the book's comments arise out of that approach. I found it difficult to get a lot out of the advice offered because I do not intend to co-sleep and wear my kid in a sling all the time."
4,Open yourself to some different ideas,"I think it's important to get a different spin on parenting than the mainstream pediatrician view provides. To that end, this is a must-have book for your personal library.I really like Sears' approach and do a lot of attachment parenting. Unlike some of the commentators you may read, I don't find the book condescending or shaming of parents who don't follow an attachment parenting lifestyle. For example, I weaned my son at 8 months and don't feel less of a parent after reading The Baby Book.Excellent chapter on illness -- one of the best treatments of this topic I have seen -- and another good one on starting solids.Another strength is how Sears' approaches parenting the high-needs baby. I had one and found his suggestions to be highly effective.The weakness of the book, I think, is Sears' reliance on anecdotal evidence to support his views. I'd like to have seen more solid data on some of the claims regarding family bed, extended breastfeeding, and so on."
2,Biased towards Moms at the expense of Dads,"While this book can serve as a helpful reference, as a new father, I've found myself repeatedly insulted by the authors' assumption that (1) the reader is the mother, and (2) that fathers only interact with their babies as ""backup"" providers when mothers are too weary. Phrases like ""when baby was in your womb,"" ""now you're a mother,"" etc. get tiring to a Dad who is putting forth a lot of effort to connect with his new child.This is all to say that it seems this book is a product of an earlier era that has not been sufficiently updated to reflect the desires of many new Dads to fully participate in the raising of their children."
3,Mother of two -- ages 5 & 2,"The medical reference information in Dr. Sears' book has been invaluable to me. However, I am not his biggest fan. Dr. Sears does not address situations where breastfeeding does not work out -- my daughter almost died at birth and even the people from La Leche told me that I would likely never be able to breastfeed her exclusively. Imagine my heartbreak and guilt when his section on bottle feeding begins with all the reasons you shouldn't do this. I experienced the book to be very judgemental. Some of his advice also has you catering to your child in a way that is impractical. Bonding with your infant and child has so much more to do with your intentions and warmth than the mechanics of breastfeeding and baby wearing per se."
4,great if you believe in attachment parenting,"I believe in attachment style parenting, which is what Dr. Sears bases his books on. My husband and I let our baby sleep with us and it is the best for us all. My 3 month old sleeps 6 hrs straight untill she wakes for a feeding, therefor we all get a good nights sleep. Dr. Sears book is great like I said, if you believe in attachment parenting."
5,This book covers it all,"I have the previous version of this book, and will be buying this one for my brother and his wife. I have referred to this text countless times over the last 3 years for just about everything. I can't think of anything they have left out. Easy, concise reading...you don't have to be 100% attachment parenting to use the information in this book."
3,Don't follow all the advice,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and after I started reading it, I felt like if I didn't follow what he said I would be a horrible mother with an unattached baby. I bought a baby sling, as recommended in this book, and used it with some limited success. My daughter does not sleep with us, and has slept in her crib from day 1. She is a healthy 9 mo. old and we have bonded well, even though she doesn't sleep in our bed, not even for naps. If you're not going to co-sleep, skip the chapter on it, and know that you're doing the right thing for you and your family lifestyle. I liked the part on breastfeeding and the information on growth and development has been helpful. I use this as one of three books I consult when I have questions. Just remember, you have to do what is right for you, not what someone else tells you."
5,Very helpful,"I bought The Baby Book just after our son was born at the recommendation of a friend. I've found it really helpful and love Dr. Sears' style of parenting. I have a high-needs baby, so his section on that and baby wearing have been especially useful for me. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to raise their child with attachment parenting."
4,Better than a lot of baby books,"I found this book at a baby store in town and decided to try and buy it cheaper on the internet, which I did. As I read through it in the store I realized that it had a lot of great info pertaining to babies, not just newborns either, it goes up to two years of age and thoroughly detailed everything from health problems that could arise to parenting issues one might struggle with (ie. sleeping arraingments). The only thing that you might not like is his personal opinion on parenting. While he is an excellent doctor you might not agree with everything he has to say."
5,Great Book!,"Great book. You will find yourself going back to it even when your kids are older. Has great charts for dosages for Tylenol, etc that are based on age and weight. I also recommend James McKenna's book Sleeping with your Baby."
5,Truly everything you need to know,"An encyclopedia of baby info. Covers nearly every topic that comes up in the first two years. Has a good index to help you find topics. This book has prevented me from running to the doctor many times by reassuring me that something is normal, it has also helped me figure out when my baby needed to go to the doctor. Contains lots of charts (feeding/development) diagrams (swaddling/breastfeeding) and lists (diaper rash/symptoms). The only topic not adequately covered is sleep, but if you get the one Dr Sears recommends on the topic (The No-Cry Sleep Solution) you'll have everything you need to feel confident as a parent of a new baby."
3,really big book,"This was a huge book, hard to hold in one hand while nursing my baby. That's about the only time I had time to read anything. I liked most of the advice in the book, but the attachment parenting was hard. I wanted and want to be able to do that, but it is so hard when I have a toddler too, I just needed to get my newborn to sleep better. So it didn't help me with that. And I just couldn't carry him around in a sling all day, it was too hard to do anything really. Bending down I thought he would fall out, or walking around I thought I would bump him into the wall, so I just didn't agree with that advice. But it's a great reference for other things."
5,Great Book,"I have read practically EVERY book out there...literally! I just got this book and love it. It has so many details. It goes into depth, which is what I wanted, instead of just generally talking about babies. Great book.PS The breastfeeding book is great also (by the same author)."
5,best baby book out there,"We used this book as our bible for the first year of our son's life. We are happy to report that he is now 3-1/2 years old, and one of the most well-rounded, happy, healthy kids we know. He eats all kinds of foods, sleeps well, and is very active in the world."
4,Good book to have,"I bought this book shortly after my twins where born. I really like, it has some good info in it."
4,Essential!,"This is a must have for anyone about to have a baby. I am a doula so I've had to read just about everything there is on baby books. This is my top favorite, and all of the Sears books are good. It has a very extensive amount of information. You can find just about anything you need to know here.I deducted one star for two reasons: 1. Though there are some pictures, I feel they could have more. Sometimes when you're an exhausted parent it's easier to just glance at a picture for some help, rather than trying to read page upon page without falling asleep. and 2. The information on vaccines is that of a doctor's point of view so of course you're not getting the whole truth. But anyone with a brain can weed out what they need from this. All in all, best book out there!"
2,Am I a bad parent?,"While this book provides great medical advice and some basic newborn care, in other regards it makes me feel like a bad parent. I am not a believer in attachment parenting so this book was not for me. Good for those people who can carry their baby everywhere in a sling (including formal affairs), can nurse on demand without being extremely washed out physically and emotionally, and who can co-sleep with their baby (mine kicks and moves all night long!). You can't help but think what the long term effects of not doing these things will have on your child. Unless you believe in never leaving your child's side, nursing until he's 3, and sleeping with him until he's ready to leave your bed (Dr. Sears says this occurs around 2-3 years of age) don't read this book. It will make you a more neurotic and paranoid parent than when before you read it."
5,Very helpful book!,"I've made it about half way through this book and really wish I would have gotten it BEFORE I had the baby. My daughter is 5 months old (was 4 months when I got the book) and it has been super helpful but I wish I would have gotten it sooner!Great read and fairly easy considering its size, great as a reference to just have around the house!But please, Dr. Sears.... you're so wise, have so much knowledge and a HUGE following, please, please take a stand on leaving baby boys intact!!!"
4,Sears Insightful and Wise,"Short review... I think Dr. Sears is perceived a lot to be biased and sometimes insulting, but I think he hits the nail on the head with a lot of issues. If you've read The Baby Book, you've gotten an overview of what all his and Martha's other books are about, so I wouldn't invest in reading the others unless you already advocate his views addressed in The Baby Book. Frankly, I like Dr. Sears and I think he is very insightful and wise. If people can get past feeling insulted and guilty (because he really does not take such a tone in this book, it is perception), they could really hear the importance of what he is saying."
1,Do Not Buy this Book!,"Ugh! This book is only useful for those parents who want to buy into the ""attachment parenting"" theory hook, line and sinker. There is no objective advice to be had here-- everything is another example of the ""dont let bad advice stand in the way of a good theory."" There are many theories of parenting, and this book has picked a particularly cultish one. You will be a slave to your infant if you subscribe to these views. The first 100 pages are about ""bonding"" (the B word!) before the book gets down to any useful information about jaundice, cradle cap, bathing... etc.For opposing theories, see On Becoming Babywise or Secrets of the Baby Whisperer."
2,not what I expected,I didn't know what I was buying: I was looking for non-attachment parenting book and here we are.So only for parents who are in that line of thinking!
4,It is a good support for first time parents!,I liked how this book supported many of my instincts. Even though it is more directed to moms who breastfeed the information was really good and it added resources to my toolbox.
5,Best baby book ever!,I love this book! I read it every since my daughter was born. I usually read it while breastfeeding her. I love Dr Sears!
5,The only book you really need (apologies to Dr. Spock),"Dr. William and nurse/lactation consultant Martha have many children of their own and give the reader Truth, helpful Truth, laced with encouragement and humor."
1,The Guilt Book,"In brief, this book will make you feel guilty about some important things: e.g., if you choose not to or cannot breastfeed, these authors will make you feel guilty about your choice/imperative. They may try to avoid doing so overtly, but in the very diction they use (for this subject as well as others), they subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) imply that your baby will suffer if not breastfed, which as all of us should know, is not the kind of thing a new mother needs to add to her already very full plate. This is just one example of the guilt this book dishes out. I heartily recommend the American Association of Pediatrics's Guide for Infants through Age 5--an informative and matter-of-fact resource."
1,Give me a break,"This book should have been called ""How to Raise a Spoiled, Overly Dependent Child"". I really wish I had read the reviews for this book before I ordered it. That would have saved me the trouble of returning it after trying for an entire evening to find a reason not to return it. Cloth Diapers? Wearing your baby? Family bed? What does that do to the marriage? This book's suggestions are nothing more than laughable."
5,Great resource for new parents,"Dr. Sears book is a wonderful resource for new parents; I highly recommend it. Written in a loving and kind manner, it gives parents insights into their babies and toddlers through the eyes of a man with many children (I think he has eight?)and a long pediatric practice. I continue to refer to it time and time again as our daughter sails through the various stages of growth and discovery."
2,"Interesting , informative and BIASED!!",This is a book that is filled with information on everything from feeding to diapering to getting the baby to sleep. My baby nurse suggested it to me. It is totally biased against anyone who does not breast feed! If you don't plan to breast feed this is not the book for you. It has tons of information on breast feeding followed by a chapter on bottle feeding. The first 4 pages on bottle feeding talk about how formula cannot compare in any way to breast milk. Hopefully everyone out there realizes feeding your baby is a very personal choice and informational books should not be filled with opinions!!
2,"Full of lots of info, but perhaps unrealistic","I flipped this book open, and found myself in the section about working mothers. Dr Sears advocates mothers staying home with their babies- he suggests ""taking out a loan"" or ""starting a home business"" if you are missing that second income by staying at home. That was all I needed to see. If that sounds like practical advice, perhaps this book is for you. I'm returning this book for one written by someone in the real world who has bills to pay."
3,"Helps, but...",...comes with a big attitude. You might want a book like this. It's heft balances the insecurity of a new parent. But we used it about three times. You can get the information about fevers from your MD. Everything else seems unecessary to me.
4,Too Preachy,"This book contains some useful information like development milestones, feeding tips, health and safety info, etc. However, much of the book is used to provote a breastfeeding/ baby wearing/ attachment parenting philosophy/ lifestyle which at times seems extreme and makes the reader feel guilty if you can't do these things (e.g. you have a preemie)."
2,Chubby Chums,"This was my second book by Shirley Jump and I didn't enjoy it as much as the first. While the story moved quickly and the writing flowed well, I never really got into it.I enjoyed that the book was set in Boston and I enjoyed Dante and Arnold but I never liked Maria that well. I never felt like I was rooting for her and Dante to be together and I hate books where the main character is always fretting about her diet.I also never felt the chemistry between Maria and Dante.I did, however, enjoy the Chubby Chums support group greatly and was glad that they were incorporated into the end. I especially liked Arnold. I would hang out with the Chubby Chums to help me achieve my dieting goals. Lord knows I need the help."
1,Not an Altendorf or Felder for Sure,"The company I work for in their startup purchased this machine.I was the one that set it up, which probaly took 10 hours. The sliding table, almost feels gritty instead of smooth with an occasional bump. The very first time we tried to use the scoring blade, the alignment motor fell off. The customer support for this was a nightmare, because no one there nows anything about it. The instruction book is very vauge with its 25 or so pages. The crosscut fence has yet to hold any tolerance at all and the stop scale will change from the front position to the rear. My reccomendation is to spend the extra 25 to 30% extra on a Felder."
1,Cover Picture Patterns Not Included,I was disappointed with this book. I liked the beaded beads on the front cover and when I realized the patterns were not included in the book I threw it away. I already know how to do peyote and was interested in some good beaded bead patterns. This book shows technique but not the specific patterns.
4,Peyote Stitch,Superb diagrams. Very easy to understand and follow.Very tasteful projects. An excellent how-to book for moderately experienced beaders.
5,Peyote stitch,"Love this book - most of the publications I end up buying I only work two or three projects, but there are only two or three in this book that I'm not interested in trying. They glaze over the odd count peyote stitch a little and focus on knot tying a little excessively, but it's still an excellent and inspirational book in a world where it's challenging to find much about peyote."
3,Flimsy and tough to assemble,"This table is adorable and less expensive than the competition, so overall it's a good buy. However, it required 2 people to assemble because the large legs must be folded and held tight while screws are inserted. There were no pilot holes for the screws, and the plastic got extremely hot in the time it took to assemble the table outdoors. Furthermore, the bench noticeably sags when my 2 year old sits in the middle seat. I don't think it will support his weight by next summer (and he is an average weight for his age)."
3,Cute but not sensible,"I recently bought this table online for my 2 year old daughter. The picture of it is quite deceiving because I noticed when I took it out of the box that the top of the table is not smooth like most children's pick nick tables are. I bought it for the purpose of coloring and play dough, however with the real wood affect it wood not be good for coloring because of all of the raised edges. It would also be very difficult to clean the play dough and food out of all of the groves. I was very disappointed."
5,Table is a hit,"I purchased the table last weekend for my 16 month old, she loves sitting at in the evening for dinner. The umbrella gives great coverage, unlike some others i researched, even off sale the table is well worth the price, for size, durablity and included umbrella."
2,Trip down memory lane,"Usually, I find Edain McCoy's books interesting and full of helpful information. This one, however,fell flat. It is more like a checklist of what the advanced Witch should know and what to consider exploring next. She was very thorough in relating what she considered necessary knowledge for beginning, intermediary, and advanced Witches. One must remember,however, that this is her opinion. Some people consider astral travel intermediate and advanced level practice while others agree with Ms. McCoy and teach it at the beginning.There were a couple of parts worthy of her name on the cover and those were the questions she asked of advanced Witches and the Dark Night of the Soul material.The bibliography would have been more helpful if it had been divided or labeled by subject matter.She mentions a few times in the book that she has been ill. I hope she takes time to rest and regain her strength and write some indepth advanced Witchcraft books."
5,New Frontiers,"I have read all of McCoy's books, some very good, others that just didn't reach me. But that's my subjective viewpoint. As Witchcraft grows in scope and knowledge, so does the liturature available to us, or at least it should. Advanced Witchcraft is an incredible piece of work directing readers to find their own inner tree of the universe and encourages them to climb to the top using their own inner-gifts and by finding their own challenges. I've already read parts of this book twice. Advanced Witchcraft has raised the bar as to what Witches must now expect from writers and elders. As always, McCoy does not dictate what is or is not right for anyone else, but with this book she has opened a huge door for us to enter and she points us in the direction where we may seek our own wisdom on our own spiritual path."
1,HATED it,"Advanced Witchcraft my foot. I was so tired of reading ""WHen you began your journey, you blah blah blah"" This book is basically a checklist of what someone should know to be labeled as an ""advanced practioner"" by the author. WHen I saw the title, I was excited. I thought finally something new for us who have been practicing for a long time to chew on. I read about half way through and took it back to the store demanding a refund. Ms. McCoy was a good author with several of her first books. I feel she is becoming like Silver Ravenwolf and pumping out books because she has a famous name in the community and can make money by her name alone."
3,Ok... But....,This is a interesting book. I teach classes with my High Priest and High Priestess and a lot of what she is saying is advanced we are teaching in our beginners classes. It is really not that advanced.
3,I didn't HATE it..... but.....,"I thought the concepts that McCoy brings up were great, but a previous reviewers stated, she assumes alot. I had no teachers, no coven, just books and free time. It's dissappointing to hear that because I learned from books, I learned too fast. Also very very vague topics. VERY vague. There is little to no detail in things like shapeshifting, and meeting your shadow self. These are advanced and she only gives us three paragraphs? Not so advanced seeming then. Go Deeper? Maybe not. I just wish there was less, rambling down a coven taught memory road, and more learning about advanced craft working. Also she disregards the use of catalysts for magick. As and advanced witch you should use less sure, but not none at all."
5,"at last, we go deeper into the mysteries","I love to read books by Edain McCoy, she is an experienced witch, teacher, and historian. It shows in her writings.In this work Edain walks down the narrow line of what is enough and what is too much for the public. It dives down deep into dark- hidden worlds of the damon, gives a clear view of the other planes, and masterfuly takes what youve learned to another stage.I recomend this book to my students after their first initiation, but the lessons presented in the text stretch through the seasons of thier lives.If you have read countless books, all encompossing the same over played themes of witchcraft; take uphold of this book, as it will change your poception. If you dont have a teacher, this book will guid you futher on your solitary path, And if you need a teacher e-mail me @ aleebrabham@yahoo.com"
4,A wonderful guide for the advanced student,"I found that the title to this book is only half accurate to what is really written inside. While astrel projection, and working in the spirit realms is (to me) advanced, this is not step by step info. However, I found if refreshing to see someone wright from the heart. I bellieve that Edain McCoy took a big undertaking, finding out the experiences that others have had, and combining them with her own, to form a well written, and free flowing book. I would reccommend this to any student who is looking for new ideas, or who just wants to ""go deeper"" into the spiritual, and unseen worlds around us."
2,OK but need to know astral projection,"This book is fair. It assumes you can astral project. Most of the advanced subjects are for use when you astral project. The author is vague about many subjects and doesn't go into a lot of detail. She tells you that you should read this book and that, if you want to know more about what she's talking about. I don't recommend this book because it doesn't seem advanced. It just gives general information and doesn't get into more detail. I was disappointed. However, it does have some info that is interesting."
1,Not worth publishing,"Llewylln should never have even published this book. It's not very well written and the information is not in any way advanced. The author doesn't seem to know what advanced magick is, so don't bother reading this book because it doesn't give any new information. Don't be fooled that this is an advanced book because it isn't. It's not even very good as a beginning book."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"When I saw the title to this book I was exciting. I thought, finally, a book that goes beyond reviewing what I already know, a tool to learn how to go deeper like the title says. I was disappointed because Ms. McCoy over and over says...when you were starting out, you felt this oor did this but advenced witchcraft can help you... but doesnt go into many details. I appreciate her effort, but more techniques needed to be added, not trying to refresh our memory"
3,SERIOUSLY Advanced Wicca,"Edain McCoy claims this book is for both Intermediate and Advanced Wiccan practitioners. However, I find it panders most to the latter. ** Ms. McCoy mentions a lot about ""when you were an intermediate, you did this"" and, ""when you first started out, your teachers had you do that"". Wait a second. If you had teachers and a coven, why would you be reading this book? ** Ms. McCoy assumes a great deal in writing this book. I've managed all Beginner work and half of the Advanced work, but where is the Intermediate material that Ms. McCoy keeps referring to, that I'm supposed to have studied? ** Perhaps since the Wicca 100/101 market is overflowing and the Wicca 300 market is booming, someone like Edain McCoy should write a Wicca 200 book?"
5,A Mind of My Own,"An excellent book to understand Aphasia, one that an individual might not think is interesting, yet is fascinating. Aphasia was a word I did not know. Strokes and brain injuries occur too often for us not to understand them, both from the point of view of the caretaker and the caregiver."
4,A bit fast paced,"This is not for beginners. There is a section that teaches you the steps, but there is not enough practice. When you go to the workout there are too many quick changes. If you are familar with cardio type dance workouts then this will probably work for you."
2,Hugs & Kisses,"Unfortunately both of my cats turned their noses up at this product, and one of them would throw up after I put it on her food"
3,last trapper review,this is a great video..the only problem is that it will not play on a dvd player here in the US..it will however play on ur computer...that is the only thing wrong with this product...
1,A waste of money!,I had this for about as little as 4 months. The first thing I noticed was that the cd they provided could not be read on any of my computers ( I have 3 laptops in my household and a main computer). Also the player could not be recognized in any of them except one of the laptops. Eventually that also stopped working. It really urks me that it doesn't automatically alphabatize or organize the music in any sort of group (it got so bad that I alphabatized it myself;not fun!!).The screen is really fragile and the touch pad is too sensitive.
1,The worst mp4 that I have had.,"I bought this player several months ago, when I look it for first time, I was very disappointed.It looks like a chinesse mp4. The first issue was the back/forward button gets stuck. The FM reception is poorly. Last, four month after the mp4 ""died"".Today it's a memory of a bad buy.If I could, I would give 0 stars to this item."
1,Scrapy product,Wouldn't start at all and the customer service said that my computer's USB is not powering that on. I tried with three diff. computers but got no luck.
4,Very Comfortable,"These cargoes are very comfortable and look nice enough for casual situations or work. As some have noted, they do tend to run large in the waist, but not excessively so in my case. I have the British Khaki and am ordering the Stone today."
3,"Levi's Men's Cargo Pants British Khake, 34 x 32","The pants are nice but I can only give them 3 stars because the material is very thin and will more than likely will wear out very soon. They are not made for rugged wear. These cargo pants are not made for any kind of physical or construction work. If you want cargo pants for that type of work then get Riggs Workwear by Wrangler. The pair that was sent to me was a little bit long, longer than 32 inches inseam which is what I ordered. Otherwise the pants are nice to wear around the house."
3,Different than store bought,Decent pants but they are of different quality than store bought. The fabric is lighter weight and the design is cheaper. But they work!
5,Levi Cargo 642 The Best,"Best fitting pants ever. I am 42 y.o. and have never found a pair of pants that fit as good as these. Ignore the reviews regarding the size on the tag not being correct, etc. Worked out for over 20 years and have always been a 32. THEY FIT!"
2,were these a knock off?,"So the tag said 31x32, but the pants had to be at least a 34x34. Way too big and way too long. I don't recall which seller I got these from but I'm thinking they had to be imitations because I've never bought pants whose sizing was that far off. I ended up just giving away the pants to a taller fatter friend because I'm too lazy to send stuff back."
5,Just what i wanted...,"These were just what i wanted....Shipping was super fast, and pants are super comfortable and durable. I bought 2 pairs this time - because they last so much."
4,Best Blind Purchase of Khakis,"Positives:Sizing was perfect. 32x32 was exactly my size, as is usual. They looked a little big when I pulled them out of the package, but they fit perfectly.There is a little cigarette lighter/coin pouch in the right pocket. First time I have seen one.Coloring is great.I was told they look ""pimp"" on me. If that is a good thing.Negatives:Has a weird ""v"" design on the back pocket. I don't like it, but I guess it is a Levi's thing. I think it is feminine, but I guess it is ""pimp.""That is it. Good pair of khakis. If they fall apart, I'll let you know."
4,"Nice. Little bit too baggy and TOO relaxed fit, but overall good!","Looks very well made - colour is good, British Khaki goes with more or less anything, and they look and feel durable, well made, and the cut of them is good.Personally I think they are slightly too big, slightly too relaxed fit, but its close to perfect for me.Overall, reasonably speedy delivery, acceptably packaged, and a good product."
4,"Too Large - America Gone Fatter, or What?",I bought Size 38x32. The actual waist of this pant measured at 42 inches. It is unacceptable that the waist measures four inches larger than the size number. Especially for a Levis product. But I have to admit that the pants are great quality. Just be sure to order sizes a coouple of inches smaller than your waist size and you should be all set. This was pointed out by someone else and I should have believed the review instead of ordering and then having to return.
3,too big!,"too bad this cargo pants is so huge for me,i ordered 40x30 thru my surprise it was so huge and trying to use a belt on it didn't work. So sad I had to return this pants. I really liked the style and the quality but i hope Levi's will make them pants same as before which are true to size."
3,sturdy cargo pants,"I ordered these for my 6'2"", 200 lbs husband, in 34 w, 36 l. They were too small round the waist, but in any case they were much too heavy for summer. Well made, but not what he wanted. I returned them."
3,I little-lot more larger than expected,"I always buy 33 X 32 Levi's, and always fits me very well. This model is larger than expected, and I had to make some arrangement to the pants, because I am out of the States at the moment, and I could not return them.Regarding quality, the truth is that they look very nice and materials are very fresh and comfortable."
3,important,"THEY DID NOT SEND The PURCHASE INVOICE And THAT I CREATE DELAY AT The MOMENT FOR KNOWING, OF THAT WAS The PACKAGE"
2,LEVI'S CARGO JEANS,"The design of these pants are great, but beware, try them on in the store rather than ordering on-line, because you will be returning them. The waist on the earlier production run of these pants measured larger than what was on the tag. In other words, if you order a 36"" waist, the measurement of the pants were a 38 1/2. Now, the laterproduction run, are running small. I ordered a 34x34, and when the pants arrived, I could not fit in to them. The length measured 32 1/2. I had to pay to return these back to the company in Okalahoma City, and they will credit my account in 2-4 weeks, the price I paid for the pants, but not my shipping cost. Quality control, is a thing of the past, and greed is a thing of the present."
4,These are great pants for wheelchair bound people,"I am constantly looking for pants that do not have a lot of seams that can cause problems when you are wheelchair bound. These pants are great. As with all my pants, I cut off the back pockets before I use them. This was easy with these pants and after that they are good to go. I wear them all the time, including work."
1,An Inanimate Video,"This video contains neither live acting nor animation. This is a video created by scanning across stills of an otherwise unpublishable comic book. To say ""graphic novel"" would be to give it too much credit. Plot: the earth is threatened by a lunar eclipse ""too complicated to explain."" It will be saved by an association of poorly drawn, strictly two-dimensional, superheroes (artist never learned lighting/shading). The comic book will be read to you by readers (not voice actors) as it is assumed you couldn't do it yourself. ""This video is strictly FOR ADULTS ONLY! Contents include Excessive Nudity, Sex Scenes and Situations,"" says the blurb, yet only adolescents will find it of interest."
5,CONVICT CRIMINOLOGY IS A SPECIAL BOOK,"CONVICT CRIMINOLOGY IS AN EDITED BOOK THAT FEATURES SOME OF THE BEST KNOWN ACADEMIC SCHOLARS IN THE FIELD. I especially enjoyed the chapters written by the ex-convict professors. They are the real experts on crime and corrections. The reading is cutting edge, state-of-the art, a new paradigm in criminology. This book will blow the cob webs off the walls of the ivory tower. This is a new criminology!"
3,What the ? is going on,"The movie was a complete spoof,nothing made any sense but I did like some of the big name stars making fun at themselves.and the fact that the credits said one star was in the movie and never was,was borderline insulting."
4,Absurd lack of basic two-way putters,"Like Gail Bailey in the previous review, I switch putt (depending on the break). It's ridiculously simple and effective, never putting across your body.In summer '95 I bought a new Titleist Bullseye Wide Blade putter, the classic John Reuter Jr. design. The heavy clubhead is perfect since it's much easier to remain consistent on both sides if I default to a smooth stroke without too much force. I would have purchased a half dozen if I'd known the bizarre future of putter design.My bullseye is well worn on both sides, disturbing nicks that I blame when the lip outs arrive. I've been unable to find a more pristine replacement. This Wilson Augusta qualifies and is very classy, but it is much lighter. That's the only reason I allow 4 stars and not 5."
5,This Simple Putter Just Works,Removing the labels on the shaft was enough of a pain that I'm tempted to subtract a star or two but this simple little putter is just too good. Along with fewer strokes on the green I appreciate the sense of touch the club provides. The grip does not seem to be of the highest quality but when it starts to go I'll be happy to buy the putter whatever replacement it wants.
2,did nothing,"did nothing, i only used for a short time but int that time did nothing for me, for my silent reflux"
5,Christopher Saint,I will show Infinite love with the video game and Show more to my relatives and my friends. I love it
5,great book,I love all things cooking and baking and this is a great cookbook with many delicious recipes. a big winner at holiday dinners
5,Beautiful guitar music from a mellow perspective,"Solo guitar. Original music. I know that it's New Age from 1980 (yes, I can sense the groans), but it's creative and interesting. Liked it back then and I really like it now. I listened to this album extensively when I was in graduate school well over 30 years ago, so it's nice to hear it again...and again!"
3,It's okay,"I bought the second and third trimester dvds because my yoga studio only has prenatal class once a week. There isn't any calming background music with this dvd, and her voice isn't very soothing while she constantly talks. Poses aren't held very long...we're always moving, but at the same time it feels like we're not doing anything. I like to stay in a pose and breathe through it for a bit. There also isn't much variety, just bending this way and that way over and over again. I was a little bored. It's an okay workout and I felt okay after it, but just okay. If you really like a relaxing yoga experience that puts you in your own utopia in your head (that's how I feel during really good yoga) you might want to keep looking. Of course, no dvd will feel quite like the real thing, as you're watching and listening to the TV and losing the natural feel and connection with the earth and yourself, and of course with baby."
1,Is this even yoga?,"I am disappointed with this DVD. It doesn't even seem like yoga. It seems like a series of jerky, spastic stretches. She doesn't hold poses - she jerks them over and over. For example you won't hold a hamstring stretch - she has you bounce up and down repeatedly which isn't helpful. Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga is much better."
2,Ok..but not great,"I bought this DVD for my wife who is pregnant. Compared to other DVDs she has tried, this one is not as good."
1,Doesn't work for rabbits,Maybe it works for deer but I bought it for the rabbits in the city of Minnneapoliswhere they seem to be running rampant this year. I followed the instructions and tried it more than once. Rabbits must be really hungry I guess. Easy to spray though and I didn't mind the smell like some of the reviews mentioned.
3,Useless,"I purchased this along with a SkipHop Diaper Bag prior to having my first child. The pattern is cute and fun, but other than that this product isnt really useful. The only thing I ever really use is the bottle carrier. My son didnt take a pacifier, so the pouch became a coin holder, and you get wipes containers everytime you purchase wipes so I now have enough to open my own business. The laminated zip case became a catch all and the diaper holder only holds 4 diapers (which when do you only need 4 diapers when you go out)? I'm just going to chalk this purchase up to the one of the many products 1st time parents buy but dont really need."
3,Somewhat useful,We use the insulated bottle holder all the time. The wipes case is useless. Wipes dry out quickly in it and it's way too bulky. A sturdy zipper-lock bag works better. The pacifier case is bulky and its design makes it difficult to remove a stored pacifier.
3,Great idea,"I actually didn't use this set as often as I thought I would. My diaper bag came with pockets and a wipes case, so the main things i i used were the pacifier holder and the black zippered envelope for extra clothes. The items are of good quality though."
1,National Security with Dust. Good history but DOA,"Roy and Ernie-professors of intelligence think the Cold War is raging, and given the sorry refocus they provide for even the Intelligence professional, this book is not going to help anyone in understanding how the U.S. Intel Services can best redistribute there efforts.Don't try this one unless you are a student of the Intelligence process. And, if you are under 50 with your brain one line, you will quickly see these Cold Warriors sre simply trying to reinvent theselves. While the Soviet Dragon was slain at the end of the Cold War, the authors claim the rather harmless snakes in the grass are just that. Enter Saddam. These snakes have grown legs and are dangerous. Fossil-write will note solve current national security problems."
