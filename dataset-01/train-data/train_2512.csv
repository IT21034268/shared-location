3,not bad,"The Log Stacker isn't bad but isn't perfect. But for the money I can't really complain. The 2x4's fit very easily. But that is the only problem. Once I started staking the wood. The vertical 2X4s started leaning outward from the weight of the logs. This made me kind of nervous so I only stacked the wood about 4 feet high. After I used that stack of wood, I added horizontal support on the top which fixed it right up. After that I was able to stack it about 6 feet high.For ease and simplicity. I give it a 10 out of 10For sturdyness and durability: 6 out if 10"
2,Would not recommend,"Although these firewood brackets are better than piling the wood on the ground, they do not provide a very strong frame for the wood."
2,Made of thin plastic,"The EZ Stacker wood crib(plastic brackets) is a product made of thin plastic, it's light and looks like it will not hold for a long time. I made a EZ stacker wood crib using 2x4s pressure treated wood(wood is not supplied) and it's sitting in my backyard, with the weather elements in New England how long is it going to last, maybe 3 to 5 years. I will give it 2 stars. note: this product can be greatly improve by simply making it of thick plastic at that point I would give it 5 stars."
2,"Plastic, not real sturdy","I did not realize that this was made of plastic, which I do not feel is practical for it's intended use. The side brackets have to be reinforced, which they do not even recommend!"
2,Instrumental covers,"This instrumentals album is a little too heavily synthesized and quickly gets mundane. While a good arranger like Lex DeAzevedo or Pat Valentino can pull this off superbly, the blending of synthesizers and real instruments leaves much to be desired here. This is the type of music that gives beautiful instrumentals a bad rap. I would liken this to elevator or supermarket music. Not the high quality custom material that used to dominate the radio back in the day. Even Musak had some better quality material in their library."
4,A Melodic Achievement,"My Chemical Romance has redefined their image as goth-punk rockers, to a more mature, relatable band. They have the undeniable talent to change up their sound with every album they make. As this band's career has progressed, they have been able to alter their music and keep the critics and the fans guessing. I found this album an incredible addition to their already polished standing. The Black Parade was able to be heartfelt, melodic, and still dark and off-beat at the same time. This band is not the same as all the other soon to be forgotten ""emo-wannabees"", and I am certain that these songs will not only be successful, but they will end up defying a generation."
4,MCR leads the Black Parade,"I love The Black Parade by My Chemical Romance. The cd sounds a lot more mainstream punk than what we have heard before from MCR, but the CD still contains the unique feel of MCR."
5,The Black Parade,"I heard ""Welcome to the Black Parade"" on the radio and immediately liked the sound, so I bought the CD. It is a great CD. All the tracks but a couple are above average. The sound is very innovative. I reacted to this CD the same as I did when I first heard ""Sgt. Peppers"". The first new music in decades."
3,This is not the product described!,"It's not in a fancy box. It has an extra record in it which includes ""Making The Black Parade"" which I don't really care about. So I'm sending it back and getting the record that's $30+ less instead.I haven't heard the album, so I can't really comment on the quality of the music or anything. I got it for my girlfriend. She thinks it's awesome."
3,"it's cute, it's hooky,it's","...not SO good. honestly, i love them, but what's up?ok, it is catchy, it has some very nice tunes, but overall, The Black Parade is more than polished: it is popish. Fine, the lyrics are still pretty dark and ensure continuity; but if you surprise yourself singing, let's say ""teenagers"" while in the shower, you'll be pretty much sounding like britney. After a few listenings, you'll get used to the sound and begin to like it, but some might still be left wondering what went on. So if you are fond of the early MCR, having thought ""I brought you..."" was supreme, and ""Three cheers..."" quite good, i'd seriously advise you to run the other way, or at least be warned."
2,It was not the amended version.,"I bought the amended version of this CD to get clean versions of the songs, especially the song ""Teenagers"". The CD I got was identical to the original CD I bought several years ago. Disappointed."
5,freak nasty awesome,"it defies everything negative anyone ever said about them.Energetic, honest, somber, thoughtful, awe inspiring, and basically AH-MAZZZZING!!!"
5,Not too old to love this album,"I am a 55 year old attorney and the mother of four children. My youngest son started listening to this album and I got hooked. This is the first album since the 1980's that I have enjoyed and listened to repeatedly. I even went to see the group with my son.I urge anyone who loves this album to ask their parents to listen to it. The melodies, the words and the theme are riveting. Although all the songs are great, I particularly like ""When you Go"" and ""Famous Last Words."""
5,"Fantastic album, with one issue.","This album rocks. Plain and simple, almost every song is well written with huge memorable riffs and great hooks. The only issue I have with it is that it borrows from Pink Floyd's The Wall to the point where it almost borders on requiring legal action. To the bands credit, they've openly admitted this..but it still irks me as a musician. The quality of the music is beyond reproach though...when that chorus from The Sharpest Lives kicks in, it's undeniable that this is a great album."
1,Why are people giving this album five stars,"Why do people talk a big game on this pile of puke. I'd call this garbage, but that would be an insult to real garbage. The music is basically written in the generic ""Look we have passion and real emotion"" but that really means that we tried to write an album but we just can't escape the generic lyrics our fans want to get shoved down their throats. I have looked at the lyrics to this album and really find it amusing that people think they have talent(which they really don't) and they can play better than many bands. ""But they have solos now"" they add, but they are not too impressive and basically novice like. Overall, I hope emo fades soon, but the good thing I'm starting yo see a decline in the popularity of emo and soon it will all end."
1,"Caution, this album changes lives!","I write this as a warning to all who may order this cd! Before I purchased this album, I was a healthy, heterosexual male in the prime of my life. I took one listen to it, and the effect was instant. I awoke the next morning to discover that I had...changed! My hair grew into a carefully groomed swoop that covered one of my eyes. I noticed scars on my wrists where there previously WERE no scars. I traded my girlfriend for a boyfriend, and I started keeping a diary full of my deep and insightful thoughts on how hard life is. Oh by the way, look out for my bands new album coming out this fall, Avenged Chemical Boy."
4,Terrific,"This album is really a winner for My Chemical Romance. I had heard the last album from them and enjoyed it somewhat, but it didn't blow me away. This album with the varied sounds really showcases them as musicians and true talents. As each song came on telling the overall story I was impressed at how they pulled off each style, from ballads, to punk, to straight out rock and more. This is a wonderful achievement, and I hope this album is the future of this band."
2,"""Clean"" version is not CLEAN!!","If you are looking for ""The Black Parade"" without explicit lyrics, THIS IS NOT IT!! This just has the shorter (single) version of ""Welcome to the Black Parade"" other than that it is the same as the version with the parental advisory on it. I don't understand why they put this out labeled this way. It doesn't even have the ""clean"" singles verion of ""Teenagers"" that was used for radio play."
5,The best album I have heard in a long time,"TBH I had never listened to this band until a few days ago. Being 37 my tastes are more older school metal (Queensryche, older Metallica, Dream Theater etc...) with some newer stuff mixed in (HIM comes to mind.) I was looking for something new to listen to and this caught my eye. Well give it a chance. This album is excellent. My Chemical Romance has the sound of an updated Pink Floyd mixed with Queen mixed with commercial punk (ala Green Day.) Also what I enjoyed was the drummer and guitarists really pushed themselves. They worked hard on this album if that makes sense. Too many musicians today seem to take the easy way out with beats that are simple with no high hat work....little to no guitar solo's and down tuning with the same old sound. This band made the best album they could and it shows. It shows on EVERY song. If you work hard and take chances (expose yourself artistically) anything is possible...to bad more bands chose not to."
4,AWESOME album...,"I bought this album expecting it to be almost like MCR's first two hits, not realizing that they had grown since then. The songs, along with the copncept, are amazing, to say the least. I listen to this album all the time. Every song has a meaning that I can relate to, and I recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a band that won't let you down."
4,Very Impressed,"I heard the brothers talk about the album in an interview with Kevin Smith, and bought it straight away.Was never my type of music, but these guys are real musicians with a flare for story. If you like anthems, and collections like Quadraphenia or The Wall you should check it out."
4,"""Amended"" doesn't cover as much as I thought..","I absolutely love My Chemical Romance, but sometimes they just have too much foul language in their songs for my liking. I bought the amended album hoping it would provide me with completely clean versions of all the songs I love so much from the Black Parade. However, the only thing that was edited out of the songs was the F bomb. All the S words and wierd noises were still there, so I still don't have a version of ""Teenagers"" I can listen to in front of my mom. Maybe I'm just being stupid and the editing out of only F-bombs versus all foul language IS the exact difference between ""amended"" and ""clean"". Anyway, I was still very happy with the product: it came in great condition quickly after I ordered it, and I love every single song."
2,Nothing new,"Its the same type of punk rock music you've heard for the last few years. Absolutley nothing new or original. I wouldn't say its a bad album, just mediocre. I would only really listen to this album if I was bored and needed to kill some time."
3,No Sir I dont like it.....that much,Sounds too mainstream like those sellouts in Green Day.Maybe it will grow on me.Revenge and Bullets are better....cult classical music.YOu cant raise a cult on this album.But i doubt if MCR cares; they only went platinum once with the last album. People have to remember that there's 5 poeple in he group. SPlittin the profits from only platinum among 5 is like gettin nothin. They want to make an album to get attention like American Idiot.
4,A Classic Album,"The Black Parade pulls from MCR's most epochal influences. Sadly many will overlook this and brand it as another ""emo"" album. However if one would listen to the music, a myriad of genres mesh together and create a truly great rock album."
2,Not Weird Enough,"""The Black Parade"" could have been weirder, and more fascinating, in a good, TV on the Radio, way. In fact, if My Chemical Romance had the talent, and inventiveness, of TVOTR, this album truly would have been, as music guide Blender put it, ""the Sgt. Pepper of screamo."" But, alas, I think a lot of music critics, in anticipating The Next Big Thing, suffered from a case of knee-jerk reaction. Let's see if MCR fans will rave about this album in five years' time, the way fans of, say, ""OK Computer"" deservedly do. I suspect not."
1,poseur emo turd,"Find a local college radio station to hear the real music before big business takes over all the airways - or hit the search button on your satellite radio and explore everything. Make it your own not what someone else tells you is cool. If the music speaks to you and is honest, not gimmicky or aimed at the lowest common denominator go for it enjoy it and see them live in a small club. That's the real grass roots music scene. Always has been always will be. Think for yourself. This is just all marketing based on product testing and past unit sales generated by coordinated hype in an effort to separate you from your money as quickly as possible. There's no integrity here the sounds from this disc are about money."
2,The Noise,"I did like the Three Cheers album, in fact I liked every single song on the cd. The Black Parade is basically the same thing. In every song I find myself being reminded of a song on the previous cd. This cd is extremely similar but has less diversity. If you already own Three Cheers, I wouldn't waste the money on Black Parade."
1,"Huge Fan, Hugely Disappointed","I really can't understand why there isn't more of an uproar over this album (I know - no one calls them that anymore). I am a huge fan of MCR and probably have listened to ""Three Cheers"" semi-daily since its release. MCR's ability to stand out in a sea of mediocrity has shown a talent and a soul to their music that others just couldn't measure up to. However, if you are old enough to remember when Member's Only jackets were cool, you will listen to every track on the ""The Black Parade"" trying to figure out who they are covering on this one. Everything is strangely remininscent and obviously uninspired. Contrived, conforming and unoriginally boring. My friend has a theory it was label pressure and I hope she is right. In that case, maybe they can find their way back."
3,Bought as a gift for diehard teen fan,"Bought mp3 download. Recipient happy. Music is questionable, at best but a favorite of my niece. Wish there was a non-explicit version available & longer samples."
2,Well....,"Great packaging, nice production job, cool costumes and few bands can pose and preen for the camera with more flair, but...with the exception of ""MAMA"" there isn't a single memorable song to be found on this CD. This is a well packaged bundle of half-realized ideas and undercooked tunes bashed out with great enthusiasm, but the whole thing is ultimately forgettable. Mere product disguised as a ""concept"" LP. Skippable."
2,One Word...,"Crap. The only reason I give this album 2 stars is because these guys are almost good musicians and they play rock. The vocals really stink, and the concept stinks. This is MTV driven trash. Horrible."
1,"wow, where to begin...","This band is the most pathetic excuse for music i think i have ever encountered. I heard a few of the songs from this album on the AOL sessions videos and it just astonishes me how unbelievably unoriginal they are. ""The Black Parade"" is by far THE worst song i have ever heard in my entire life. It sounds like an extremely crappy/cheesy ripoff of Queen. There lies NO talent whatsoever in that song. The song ""Cancer"" sounds like that Jet song ""Look What You've Done"" that came out a couple of years ago. Not to mention, the fanbase is more pathetic and laughable than the band itself. Everything about this band is amazingly unoriginal. I am not telling you what to like and not like, i am just stating my opinion. But hey, if you like this miserable excuse for a band, more power to ya. To each his own, i guess."
1,better... i guess,"like anyone who knows anyone who even watches a little MTV i have heard this entire album entirely too many times. Yes, it's better than their last batch of... songs? but that really aint saying much. And they're not the only ones out there. Is this ""new era"" of music supposed to be this bad? My god!"
2,Another whiny album,"NOTE I DON'T HATE EMOS BUT COME ON, DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY OR WEAR ,OTHER THAN PAIN OR BLACK ! Anyways the music is good ,gives you the feel of The Sex Pistols and the Hard Punk Pop Rock feel .What kills It ,is the Girl voice of Gerard Way that Fu****cks Everything up .And the whining lyrics .DON'T BUY THIS IF YOUR NOT EMO ,And If you are emo your a proud fan :::)"
5,Don't Call 'Em Emo (At Least Not Anymore),"Nowadays, emo is considered anything that involves dudes in eyeliner and tight pants ""crying and screaming"". That describes MCR's last 2 albums. The Black Parade on the other hand, is a resurrection of epic rock. They took things to a whole new level by bringing in a whole new story, (Hence The Patient, Mother War) an orchestra, and LIZA MINELLI! This album is amazing and once you hear it from beginning to end, you're gonna wonder what happened to those guys that wore black and red all the time. And the lyrics alone will make you see why they should no longer carry the EMO label. Here are my favorite tracks:This is How I DisappearWelcome to the Black ParadeHouse of WolvesMamaSleepDisenchantedFamous Last Words"
3,Suprisingly Great Album,"Im actually an 18 year old reviewer. Just didnt feel like registering. I would like to say that I hated my chemical romance for a LONG time. I loved Bullets...and it all went down hill from there when i saw them live and three chears released and became one of the most cliche albums in the rock scene. When i saw them play live a few years ago i was saddened by how bad they did. I saw them on tv recently and they sounded excellent live. When i listened to this album I left myself with an open mind, considering that MCR sold out the minute they entered the music scene. These guys entered the music scene being a sell out band and always will. But that doesnt mean they dont have talent. Though this album is far from original and steals from rock over many years it isnt far from MCRs old style except that its much better and is a really good rocking album. Time will only tell how true they really are to their music."
4,A worthy follow-up,"Personally myself, I believe that MCR's previous album, ""Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge""--rated 5 stars by top shows and magazines--is an extremely hard album to follow up. But just their capability to think of such amazing songs for this new album (such as Cancer and Mama, and, of course, Welcome to the Black Parade) makes up for the one or two last songs on this album that aren't as amazing as you'd hope. All in all I say good job; it's hard work following up an album like Revenge!!"
3,Good Record,"I'm not the biggest MCR fan, but I did like some songs off of the previous cd. I think this cd is pretty good. I like the concept the band walks us through. I must admit, I actually like the Black Parade video more than I like the song, the imagery is just beautiful. Dramatic stuff, but I like dramatic, so it's all good. I like Mama a great deal, but over-all I don't like every song on this record. That's okay as well, because I didn't like every song on Three Cheers either. However, I do like this band, even if I don't like everything they write, I do see what great musicians they are. I just think they are solid and they rock-- and there's nothing wrong with that!"
3,Feels more like a step down,"Yes, I am going to compare this to Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, and while I don't usually do that, I am going to. Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge was a very, VERY good album. The ammount of originality and energy it contained was probably equivalent to a super nova. It had a vibe eminating from it that made you feel like dancing no matter where you were, and I just don't get the same feeling from The Black Parade. I'm not going to say that it's a bad album, because it isn't. It simply feels like, I assume, when you take a drug and get high and then you find this similar drug and it doesn't get you high at all.I'll give it a few more listens and hope it grows on me, and if it does this review will change, but until then I highly reccomend the release before this one."
5,The Black Parade might be dead but lives on in fans for ever,"This band is one of the greatest ever. And I'm not being one of those ""I love MCR 24 hrs a days kind of fan"" but I really do think that cd is one of my chemical romance's best cds ever. I have listned to it over and over and over again that I never get tired of all the songs on here. I love this cd and the other cds my chemical romance has made. I hope that they continue to make more cds and to continue to not care what other people have to say about them. I would really recommend this cd to my friends if they listened to rock but since most of them don't I would really recommend this cd to everyone else."
4,The Black Parade,"I got this for my niece and she plays it a lot in the van, her father seems pretty amused by it and thinks it is much more tolerable than most music teenagers like these days."
5,Fantastic,"This is fantastic. Kind of depressing, but at times also kind of inspiring...or just plain hilarious (I'm thinking of the hidden track). The lyrics and melodies are beautiful, and the songs are different enough from each other that you can't get bored. Definitely a good thing. All in all, this CD is just...beautiful. Amazing. Whether or not you're really into very hardcore music, you're bound to like it."
4,A review for grownups only . . .,"As a forty-something, it is great to hear a record that understands what rock and roll is . .. it's audacious, it's funny, it's energetic, it's the kind of record that Alice Cooper or Queen might make if they were still young, relevant and (at least in Freddy Mercury's case) alive. ""Teenagers"" is worth the price of admission for me - - I haven't heard a better single this year. If you like the power-rock of the late 70's (which I do, to a certain degree), and want to recapture a bit of your youth - - check this one out - - I don't think you'll be disappointed."
1,It SUCKS!!!!!,"Wassa-madda? The word ""SUCKS"" too foul of a word? Well, for the foul mouthed language this cad uses to attempt to be funny, ""SUCKS"" is clean.Lounge singers have always been amusing and entertaining, however, to be foul mouthed and vulgar in an attempt to be funny subtracts from all the great musical talent that supports this act.Perhaps I should have read into his name more to understand what I was getting into- RICHARD CHEESE?!?! RICHARD as in DICK?!?! Let's leave it there.This CD is so vile, I have destroyed it rather than pass this vulgar trash on to somebody else. I'll call it a financial contribution to moral descency.READER, don't waste your time with this CD. Save your money and make a donation to a worthy cause that feeds, clothes, or houses people. I'm serious."
3,could be better but could certainly be worse,"I am a huge fan of Richard Cheese but was a tad disappointed in this album. It's lacking compared to the first two albums, especially Lounge Against the Machine. However, the humor is still on target. While some of the songs do seem like filler, his takes on ""Gin and Juice,"" ""Yellow,"" and ""Longview"" are absolute classics. If you're already a fan, grab this one; otherwise, I'd recommend his other albums."
4,More Cheese Please,I have about 4 Richard Cheese disks now. This ranks probably #2 below Lounge Against the Machine. Another collection of great pop songs done in Vegas Lounge fashion. Fans of RC will not be disappointed.
4,needs one for the fish tank,"if you hate to put your hand into the tank to fix things, this is the great product to buy. the grip is not very strong but it will work the way you want it. after all, I can't say it is a weak product since it is working in the tank."
3,Good general effect,"Althoug not so detailed as William Shatner's ""STAR TREKMEMORIES"", this book deals mroe with Nimoy and his career notonly in Star Trek, but as a clever and capable actor, director, screenwriter and producer."
4,long deserved book,"Nimoy gave us a great story in this book, written in a simple and direct style (but not cheap nor vulgar), tgalking about his career as an actor, screenwriter and director. It's veryg rateful to know how someone with strenght of character may suceed, even being the son of poor Russian parents. He put an end to rumours that said that he and Shatner hated each other."
4,GREAT PERSONAL NARRATIVE !,"Even not being a ""trekker"", I bought this book, because everybody knows how Nimoy is an intelligent fellow. Written with the intention of putting down some bad feelings left behind from his previous book (1975) ""I AM NOT SPOCK"", and without the help of a ghost-writer, Nimoy writes in a particular style I'd call ""Friendship style"", clearly respecting his fans and tryin to give a general picture of what really was (is) his life, not even in one moment showing indulgence or arrogance. Explendid auto-biographical job."
5,couldn't put it down!,"As I preceeded to read, I felt as though I was with Leonard every step of the way, feeling whatever emotion he felt and absorbed. Very indepth book. He clearly states the good times, the bad times, even the times in-between from the start as how ""Star Trek"" got started, to the present-of his writing the book. I would pick it up again and re-read it, reference it, and (not) let my friends get their dirty hands on it! For fear of loosing the book!"
5,I AM Spock,"This is a wonderfully written account of Mr. Nimoy's 'Spock' experience, detailing the development of the iconic character, experiences with the studio, with lots of humorous anecdotes. I love the 'conversations' between Mr. Spock and Mr. Nimoy!"
3,"It was funny, it was heartwarming","I AM NOT SPOCK was one of the hardest books for me to find. But it was worth the wait. I realy liked the dialogue between Leonard and Spock, and how Spock kept stealing the pens from the producion company and Leonard was asked about.How Leonard was lost at first without Spock, but, Spock was never really gone. Mr Nimoy also talked about how Spock almost took over his entire life while filming Star Trek.Over all, its a great book. I read it several times."
1,TOTALLY USELESS,"While the Roll On is darned good (love not getting liniments on my hands), the patch is completely useless in terms of killing pain. It even caused some.Why haven't all analgesic makers learned WE DON'T WANT TO SMELL LIKE WE ARE A PINE FOREST? Do you want to broadcast the fact that you are in pain to the world?Who wants a long train or bus ride with you next to them smelling like these products? Who among you?The Celadrin products are a far better choice for effectiveness than this, but they too full of the MENTHOL THING SCENT, as well.REMOVE THE SCENTS in all skin pain relievers. We don't need them."
1,Useless,"I ordered this because my aunt was looking for them. They arrived quickly, were expired, and she said they did not help her. To the company's credit, they did process a timely refund."
1,HORRORible!!!!,"The only way this movie would rock is if people actually THREW ROCKS AT IT! I am always blown away buy people who say a movie is great if you don't judge it against other movies.... What do YOU judge it against?? Avacados??? Well in comparison, to that I suppose this has more action than an avacado, but it tastes worst and the party level is lower. The idea isn't even original. The FEMALE ALIENS COME TO EARTH TO GET SEX has been around since the 1970's (check out BREEDERS & LIFEFORCE for better examples). Don't try to sell this movie a ""campy"", its just bad, unfunny & so preditable you can almost talk along with the characters from the first viewing. PASS, PASS, PASS!!!!"
2,"Agreed - could have been decent, but....","This movie was a bit frustrating. Not for the reasons you might thing, though. The plot was simple enough, but this was one movie that didn't know which way it wanted to go: horror comedy, or horror thriller (though the acting was actually pretty good, especially for a low-budget Canadian film). Had it tried to be the former, and left out the serious stuff, it would have actually been pretty funny. But, in the end, it tried to be the latter, and that is where is failed... so, I'd have to say, I wouldn't recommend this one for anything more that a one time, just for fun rental."
3,Pretty funny. That's it though.,"This movie has a very thin plot. Aliens from a planet where it's inhabitants are dying come to a college to mate with the human males and save their race from extinction. That's all. If you've seen Species then you know the basic idea. The difference is great though. I think Species was really entertaining. This movie wasn't close to that good. It has some ok comedy moments in it, but that's it. I wouldn't buy this movie. It's not a bad rental idea though."
3,"Not The Best, Not The Worst","This is a fun little movie and could have been fairly great except that it changes pace in the middle and goes from Alien-Human Romance into Alien BBQ & then Alien Shoot'em Up.You begin to feel for the plight of at least one of the ""Blonde Snow Queens From Space"" (assuming you're open to that) and then the movie changes gears and it's sort of downhill from there.I enjoyed the ending somewhat, it's a horror movie ending, but I want a sequel and I want survivors. They could reanimate the dead roomates and clone an alien or two. Throw in an alien baby & voila!Matt Hastings, the director, seems like a great guy. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders. I consider this a great popcorn movie for when you don't want something really scary like ""The Ring"". But I'd rent it first if you're unsure though."
4,B movie on ice,Decoys is a standard b movie that dose not take itself as oscar material. There are times when it even pokes fun at itself.
2,A guilty pleasurefor U of O & cheesy movie night contender,"This movie is definatly amusing. You'll groan, you'll laugh and you will yell at the screen CONSTANTLY. Pure unbridled cheese.Also if you are a University of Ottawa student it's a great opportunity to play ""Name that building"" since almost the entire movie is shot on campus. Very noticable cameos include Seraphin Marion, Taberet Hall and Brooks Rez."
1,Horrible,"Decoys is a by the book horror movie. It's made for guys, but the nudity is not even there. Save your money."
3,Dry Ice,"When I read the back of this DVD, I thought the plot line sounded a lot like ""Species"". Being a girl, I'm not usually too enthralled with the idea of watching hot naked monster girls seduce college frat boys, but I checked it out anyway. I didn't have high expectations, especially after reading the other user comments on Amazon.But you know what? This flick is actually pretty darn entertaining.Decoys definitely has its moments, mostly because it doesn't take itself too seriously. This isn't in the same class as ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""An American Werewolf in London"", but it does serve up an enjoyable blend of humor and horror. Maybe the humor was too dry for some people and went over their heads? Or maybe I'm just odd, but I liked it."
2,Puppy puppy,"This sci-fi flick wavers indecisively between goofy/stupid and a lame attempt at being a monster movie, never really making a commitment one way or the other. This inconsistent approach sinks it immediately because it's never quite funny or scary enough to serve either genre. The plot wanders and drags, one minute a beauty pageant, the next there's a Hardy Boy & Nancy Drew trying to solve the case, all the while the prime suspect hallucinates and behaves like a maniac. Why Nicole Eggert and Richard Burgi were in this movie is anyone's guess.A good idea gone awry. Not a keeper."
1,Decoys.....divert this debacle of a horror movie,"Pretty bouncing blondes are aliens as they pick male companions, have sex with them adn then the males freeze from the inside out. Anyway, there's this kid who looks like he's trying to mimic Colin Farrell who figures out that the blondes are aliens and no one believes him but then towards the end they all believe him or just his friends do. Ok, I think that the writers, director and actors all were on drugs and this has got to be the most cheesiest and corniest thing ever. Also starring Baywatch babe Nicole Eggert...she has a really corny line...""Baby got backup"" Come on....that's so dumb"
1,Alien and The Stepford Wives Go to College,"* 1/2In the cheapjack horror flick ""Decoys"" - which might more accurately be entitled ""Sorority Chicks from Outer Space"" - aliens disguised as blond co-ed bimbos terrorize a college campus by turning horny frat boys into freeze-dried fudgsicles. Luke is the freshman who uncovers the plot but can't get anyone to believe him.Set on one of those college campuses in which the students pursue everything but their academic studies, ""Decoys"" can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a straight-ahead horror outing or a parody of the genre. Unfortunately, it fails miserably at both, being neither scary nor funny, just idiotic and lame. Although there's a reasonably diverting twist at the end, the movie can't overcome its silly script and cheesy special effects. Send it to the trash bin."
5,How 'bout some melt of Ofrion!?,"This is a classic b horror movie. If you don't like stupid low budget horror movies that you can laugh at, then by all means don't watch this. This movie is not to be taken seriously, but it has so many memorable quotes, such as ""how 'bout some melt of Ofrion!?"" or ""baby got back up."" This is the hardest I've laughed in a long time. Highly recommended."
4,Worked great!,"This is a product that will fit most any hydrant, and the price was fair. would recommend to anyone looking to repair their hydrant."
1,Borefest,"This grammar book is boring. Since it is written from English to Arabic, I only wish this book could help enunciate each word a little better, like the one from Naglaa Ghali, ""Arabic Grammar Unravelled"". Such as the Spanish learning tool books, you have to be skeptic about the author if Arabic isn't their native language (Jane Wightwick???). You cannot possibly learn to communicate with this book and instead, I recommend the ""Alif Baa with DVD's"", Introduction to Arabic Letters and Sounds"" before any grammar book for all beginners. I don't understand why some people gave this 5 stars."
3,Not bad for an introduction,"If you have no background this book can be useful, but it isn't one I would recommend buying. One problem is that they don't introduce the whole topic (e.g. the grammar of prepositions) at once. There are a few mistakes in the book (not in the grammar). It is useful to do the practice exercises. Haywood & Nahmad's book, 'A New Arabic Grammar', is a better book though the language and vocabulary used are an older style."
5,Totally Worth It,"I bought this item when it was only $0.01. Seriously, how can you even think of passing that up? The cases are simple and space saving, with a fair amount of stuffing to keep your games safe. Theres a few extra slots in the side pocket to stash even more video games and the pocket on the front for memory cards or whatever else you can shove in there. It's a great case wit han old style flair that I love and it's so worth the $0.01 (plus S&H of course)."
3,Classic album...almost,"Babe Ruth made three really fine albums. ""First Base"" is by far my favorite. Their self titled album and ""Stealing Home"" are excellent as well. ""First Base"" has some excellent rockers including: Black Dog, The Mexican/For a Few Dollars More, Joker, and (my favorite) The Runaways. Now...""Amar Caballero"" is a major disappointment to me. There are a few nice songs (Lady, We are Holding On, and the title track) but the rest of them are really not worth listening to. If I had it to do over again, I would have purchased ""First Base"" as a single CD and not bothered buying this dual CD. I really do only listen to half of this CD. ""First Base"" is a classic...""Amar Caballero"" is a waste of time."
5,Babe Ruth - You should never have missed them!,"I saw Babe Ruth for the first time At Hatfield Poly some time in the beginning of the 70's. and after that I was sold.The classical strains from Alan Shacklock and the voice of Jenny Haan were a perfect match. I saw The original line up twice after that concert, once in St Alban where thay left the building skaking and once in Mornington Cresent (London) where they once again left the area partially demolished.After Alan Shacklock left and other people started to influence the music thay went further and furtehr from their root, and finally after Jennie and Dave left the band and Elly Hope (The Hope Sisters) took over it was not long before Babe Ruth were no more..Vic Thompson panta.rej@swipnet.se"
2,Album ok,"This items was described a new and original, however, I have an original of the same album and the one I purchased is not an original. The cover is a reproduction and so is the vinyl. Glad I didn't pay a lot of money for this item."
3,The best reason to have this is to compare to the amazing 2012 ReMaster so you really appreciate how great that new version is!,"I don't remember my old LP sounding like this old version. It might be ok for collectors, but to really enjoy the music to it's full potential, just get the 2012 version. Jesus Christ Superstar (2012 Remaster) [Original recording remastered, Soundtrack] from Amazon.com."
4,Music fan from the seventies,"I listened to the album for 30 years before I bought the tape. I bought the gold CD after reading one review that said it was best ever, and another review that said there was virtually no difference in the remastered versions; in my opinion the second guy is right. Save some money. I see little difference, if any, in quality between the original album and the $45 CD. Live and learn."
5,Jesus Christ Superstar,"Though I felt it was very expensive, actually over priced, which takes advantage of those of us who are hooked on this rock opera, I love it and listen to it often."
5,Some good good stuff,Listened to this album a zillion times back in the day. Got every note hard wired in my brain. Most enjoyable.
4,Concert movies,"Concert movies tend to suck, the very fact that it's recorded and you're watching it in your living room breaks with what's happening, and they tend to end up feeling ""guh."" You can't feel the energy in the room, you can't look where you would normally look (take a glance at a person around you and you can see how they react) so all of that ""ambience"" is lost.I used to do the ween website before they did their own, so I'm biased here, but Ween is such a great live band and it totally shows on this DVD. Their craftsmanship is top notch.I would agree with the other reviewer about the energy level and level of showmanship being lower than a typical ween show, I think the fact that the cameras were present has a lot to do with that."
2,Seems like over priced.,"It works like advertised, but seems like it has been over priced. If you go to local hardware store, you may be able to find a better one for a cheap price. Also I had a hard time, removing the bulb from the holder. I don't know whether it is a problem of the ceramic holder or the bulb, but I believe it is the ceramic holder because same bulb goes to a different holder without any problem."
3,Not worth the money,"I purchased this lamp only to realize it's A LOT bigger than it looks on the image. I returned it the next day.It does not come with any stand or clamps, so I suggest you buy one. You can reuse the clamps from other Zoo Med lamps, but due to the size of this product, it doesn't work too well. It's perfect with the hanging stand, but that's another $20+."
5,It is well made,You do pay more for this than you would at your local HD but you will get what you pay for. I have owned lots of these domes. The ones from HD do not last that long. This is also Nice and deep for your bigger lights.
1,to bad to make me sleep,uh. like uh. change the station.... the guy that recommended the wheelies has no idea how confused he is.
2,Cannabis Spirituality : Including 13 Guidelines,"I did not find this book very insightful. I did not like the written language, Stephen Gaskin used. The author's 13 guidelines are all common sense ideas, and if you need to buy this book to learn them than you shouldn't be smoking in the first place. I think the author is just using the cover art and the catchy title to rake in the bucks. It is hard to read because the author does not flow from one idea to the next, he abrupty changes subjects, mid-sentence, leaving me to wonder if this guy has smoked a little too much, too quickly, for too long. Pito:)"
5,Yum!,"I love Wise onion rings and was hoping to find a good deal on them through Amazon. But I have purchased them for 78 cents a bag from Walmart, which is far cheaper than this and you don't have to buy in bulk. Plus, the bag clearly states a retail price of 99 cents, yet the distributor is charging $15 for 12 bags (and before shipping!)If you looking for something like Funyuns, these aren't it. They don't have the same texture at all, and I would advise trying a bag before buying 12. For instance, my boyfriend loves Funyuns, but isn't crazy about Wise onion rings."
1,Did not accept a full charge.,"Upon receiving the new battery, it would not accept a full charge. Battery was returned today after attempting 5 times to fully charge it."
5,Cuando comencé a leer este libro,"un vientecito fresco y aromado entró ...pero cuando volví la cara, la ventana estaba cerrada...Pero sucede lo mismo cada vez que uno lo lee: Es como una brisa suave que nos llega al corazón !HERMOSO !"
4,Challenging,"The video has two fifteen minute workouts. The first workout mostly deals with the upper and lower abdominals and includes 3 different sets of pushups in between segments of the ab workout. The second workout mostly centers on the oblique muscles with 2 different sets of pushups in between segments. These workouts made me quite sore the first time I did them and they are still a challenge. The only complaint I have is that the video only contains 2 different workouts (not much variety for those of us who want to work our abs more than twice a week!). The music is not that great either. However, this video is worth purchasing if you can find it!"
5,Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!,"This advanced Abs of Steel tape is great for dedicated exercisers who want quick results. The tape has two workouts, and the first is definitely the most challenging. The first day I did the tape, I was very sore, but I saw quick results when I used the tape consistently. Buy this tape and you will definitely get abs of steel."
5,Challenging with results.,The workout is broken up into two segments each 15 minutes which is great for me. I can spare 15 minutes a day to get my abs in shape. It's a fast workout with results. I love it. I work my abs everyday with short videos like this. This tape is definately a KEEPER!!!
3,Disappointing,This CD sounds like it was recorded in a large armory with a single microphone. It has too much reverb and too little clarity of sound. Some of the arrangements could also have been better.
3,not so good but it is OK,"The arousing movie is surely based on the imagination of the screenplay writer and the director. The lack of the philosophical depth , the slow-to-death development of the plots...contribute to the underrating.Hence , I only generously give it a 3-star rating."
1,Not for the real world!,"This book offers several academic methods for setting goals and measuring the success of those goals based on user evaluation. This is fine if your clients are willing to pay up to 5 times the cost of a less stringent design process. The problem with this book's guidelines is that they seem to be based in a world of fantasy where everyone has 30 hour days they can devote to working on the pre-design analysis of a site. While this would be ideal, it is far from realistic.Overall I found this book to be full of nice ideas but lacking in real world application. If you want a guide to designing user-centered web sites for clients with unlimited budgets and patience, then this is your book. However, most of us live in a world with more constraints and less freedom than what these ideas would require."
1,WAY overdone,"This book is an overcomplicated and useless study of the obvious. The author basically tries to apply structured development and database design theory to web design.Anyone can create and I/O diagram or flowchart. Basically, anyone who knows structured programminging would gain absolutely nothing from this book. Anyone who doesn't know the design process, will only become confused an frustrated.The author unsuccessfully tries to simplify the prototyping process, and never explains it either. Basically, he teaches that web design is a monotanous process that must be done over and over again until it comes out right.Any Analysis and Design book would teach someone a great deal more than this book. The author tries to reinvent the wheel by creating a square.This is certainly a poor book indeed."
2,Be careful what you wish for,"The drivers and software came with it creates problems to other programs. If I were you, I will not purchase this product until all the driver conflicts are resolved. Things I am having problems with:1. Drivers. Apparently, the drivers causes LINK.EXE and MIDL.EXE to freeze indefinitely (locking problems?). If you aren't a software developer, I believe it probably won't affect you. If you were using Visual Studio or Visual C++, these drivers will freeze linker or idl compiler. Uninstall the drivers fixes this problem.2. Shutdown problem. After installing these drivers/softwares, shutdown seems to take much longer than usual if not frozen.Too bad it is too late for me to return this product."
2,cam = good...software = not so good,"orbit mp cam itself is very good. Installing the software is another story. Quickcam software from cd never installed properly, only partial install so the video effects didnt work. I had to go the website and wait for a newer version of the software to fix the problem. The video effects is the only reason I bought the camera. Since then, two more updates to the software have been released, each one with their own set of problems from not installing properly to 100% cpu usage during web effects.I have never had so many problems with webcam software. I am afraid to upgrade software due to the fact that it might break something. Good thing I have a Creative Labs Live Motion cam too.I will never buy another Logitec cam. The Creative Labs cam software installed correctly the first time and updates are very simple and dont break anything. For my money Creative Labs cams is the way to go. Don't waste your time or money on a Logitech Cam. Their support is very bad too."
1,Downgrade from the older Orbit,"I upgraded from the Orbit to the Orbit MP and found that it is a major step backwards in quality.The software control panel is much harder to use, with very coarse and twitchy sliders. You can't type numbers into the edit boxes.Also, although still images are wonderful, the quality of live video for webcams and chat clients is horrendous. The subsampling algorithms used to convert the high-res camera images into low-res images for transmission cause blurring, loss of definition, and constant snow/shift patterns.I'm going back to my $30 low res camera that provides higher quality for video conferencing."
3,"Good Webcam, Bad Drivers/Software","I bought two of these as my fiance is visiting her ailing parents and we wanted to see each other and free up the phone lines (we can talk for hours!) We both love the cam, but have had the same error messages on both computers and various problems that seem to be related to the software. I would give the camera a full five stars, but the software problems drag it down to three."
2,Logitech QuickCam,I am not happy with the product i keep getting an error message and a blue screen and have to reboot. i will be sending this back to the vendor for replacement or what ever it takes to get it takes to work.
3,Meh,"Read the computer specs closely. This does not work with newer systems. I learned that hard way.Oh well, My fault.."
1,"Does Not Work As Advertised, Per Many Users","Shortly after I got this as a gift, which cost $130.00 at the time, the pan and tilt stopped working.Then I saw that many other users pan and tilt never worked. Now that I have Windows 7, I found out that Logitech never bothered to update the drivers from XP to Windows 7. Windows 7 automatically installed a basic webcam driver, but I found out the hard way that there is no audio driver support. I have found better webcams available with higher resolution for less than $40.00. Don't waste your money on this model. I will never buy a Logitech webcam in the future."
5,Great webcam,"Had some difficulty installing the software on Windows Vista x64, but with the help of Logitech got it going (turns out it takes a LONG time to load the software - don't interrupt the installation). Love the motorized pan and tilt!!"
2,Good video and audio but bad software hogs system,Overall the video and audio quality is good if you just install the driver only. If you install the full software then it will take over your system and hog 70% of the memory available. It also adds many start up items that should not be running all the time. Logitech needs to come out with some decent software or they are going to be out of business very soon.
1,Worst software ever!,This camera would be great if it actually worked. The software is garbage and I have thrown away 10 hours getting this to work. Too bad Logitech's cutomer service is only open during regular business hours instead of when people would actually use it and to make it worse everyone I talked to had no idea how to fix any of these problems. The online help area is garbage.
1,Does not work,Low quality in every respect as explained in the other one star reviews. I will add that my audio went from static to digital randoness after a couple hours of use.When I uninstalled the software it killed all my video drivers and I had to reinstall them.
3,Great Picture but Software & Robotics is Poor,"I purchased this item to have a high end webcam. All my clients raved about the quality of the picture while using skype. However, when I used the face tracking features it did not work. Also, I think the software is not up to par considering the cost of this item. The software is not easily accessible, easy to use and has limited features. Neverthless, if the quality of the picture is your thing, it is one of the best on the market currently.P.S. ""We work by doing, when it's the art of not-doing is what really works"""
1,Piece of Junk,"Mine didn't work out of the box. Just my experience. I am taking this thing back to the store tomorrow. I returned another crappy webcam today to buy this, so you can imagine how irritated I am with the lame quality of these things."
2,Not Supported for Mac OS X,"When I purchased this product I was specifically looking for a webcam that was supported for Mac OS x. I thought this was, but in fact it is not. So, I was really not able to evaluate it other beyond this, except to notice that it looked and felt like a quality built product."
3,Falls short of expectations,"I purchased one of these due to availability of other comparable units. The camera looks good, however the software falls short of what I would expect. There is no remote monitoring software, no software SDK (Logitech refuses to even consider it) No security software (such as monitoring, motion detection) and the software which is available basically allows only use for the camera as a videoconferencing unit. If your looking for a resource intensive video conferencing unit which has good video quality, with no other features, then it may work for you. The software itself seems to work (ver 10.0.0.0) only up to a limited point at 640X480. Otherwise the 1.3 MP setting is just too much for even a dual XEON 2.5Ghz with 3G of Ram, and nothing else running. Logitech comes up short on customer support, also: Basically unpleasant and interpretively rude. I'm sending it back."
1,DOES NOT WORK - DO NOT BUY,"I thought it would be neat to converse with relatives using webcam. So I looked into Skype and saw that it recommended Logitech. I ordered two of the best webcams Logitech offered and shipped one to me and one to my sister. My sister and I are both IT professionals.We wasted - I don't know how many hours trying to get this thing to work. It is very flakey. It would work and then not work. You uninstall everything, reinstall everything, it works once - and then back to not working. I would caution you to do your research carefully before ordering this item. Google ""logitech QuickCam problems"" and similar searches and you will see major problems.Now that the webcams are opened - we can't return them and have lost several hundred dollars."
2,A little too personal,"Lots of stories about they came to barefoot running but not so much on hard data. Nice people, though. Kind of sorry I bought it."
2,don't waste your money on this one,"I purchased this video because it sounded like a lot of fun, unfortunately this video does NOT make for a good workout, but, I had to give it at least 2 stars for the great music. There is a pause in the workout between each song which really interrupts the flow of things. Also, Denise does not do a very good job, the people behind her perform better than she does, and when the guys from the live band come up beside her, she gets completely out of synch with everyone. I definately do not recommend this one!"
4,Book Description Only,"Synopsis:Zen Master Takuan Soho (1573-1645) was living proof of the saying, ""If you are a master of Zen you can be a master of anything"".Takuan was a master of calligraphy, painting, martial arts and gardening, and the abbot of Daitokuji, the leading Rinzai Temple in Kyoto.In this book we have an account of Takuan's life and translations of all his important writing."
5,The Mountain Top...,has been reached with this beautiful movie. It was well done. It shows the struggles that preachers has to go through. Susan and William did a very good job in this film. Well Done.Check out this movie today. You will be glad you did.
5,I'd Climb the Highest Mountain,"This great classic. I really enjoyed it, it's a 5 stars for me.Great acting, pure, simple, funny and sad, everything you need for a great movie."
4,Very nice,"I am enjoying this very much. The music is just my style. I really like the concept of scripture songs. Would rate higher but it I like Glory Revealed II so much better, I'm reserving 5 stars for that one. Like them both."
3,Nice album,"This album was ok. I think I had in mind an album more like 10,000 Reasons, so I set myself up for disappointment. It is a nice album, it is just not one of my favorites."
5,Excellent Worship Aid,"I love this CD. The songs are each based on a particular verse of verses that facilitate meditation on the Word of God while I enter into His Glorious Presence and experience His ""Glory Revealed."" Love it!"
2,"detailer,s choice 48315 interior car duster","i have used it a few times and it dise not do what is said of the product the interior doea not come clean it does take up a little dust but thats it ,it did not clean all the dust like it said it would"
1,made my interior worse,"If your interior is already cleaned, don't use it. It will leave lots of lint on your dash. I have a one week new car and i wanted to keep my interior dust free. So I got this from Amazon with other car care products. I had applied some ArmorAll on my dash and leather seats to keep it protected. After a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash. So I wanted to start using this duster. After opening it brand new out of the blister pack, I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel. I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should ""Pick UP"" dust instead of leaving ""LINT""? Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again...."
1,Leaves more than it picks up!,Get a California Duster instead. This duster just moves around the dust and leaves lint everywhere. A waste of money...
2,Left lint and thread all over my dash,"I have a limited edition, high performance car with a lot of bespoke Alcantara trimming on the dash and the doors. This product left fuzz, lint and thread all over the interior. I ended up laboriously sucking everything up with a hand-vac.Disappointed."
1,"Awful, avoid.","I purchased this ""Interior Car Duster"" expecting it to DUST the interior of my car... my problem is that I interpreted this incorrectly. What it actually does is ADD dust and lint to your interior, falling apart and leaving pieces of itself on the very first use. Upon continued use (gotta give it a chance, right?) I noticed that it actually did not pick up dust off of the dash, seats, door panels, screens... it left its own lint, and more pieces of itself. I could see the dust floating in the interior every time I picked it up. What a pile of trash this is, avoid at every cost unless you are looking for something to actively add dust to your interior."
5,Gems from Emerson,"I recently took a class that reawakened my love of Emerson. I checked out this book at the library, then had to own it. Each day of the year is a selected writing from Emerson's essays, sermons and or lectures. It's a great opportunity to read a gem from Emerson each day. Then there is a question that invites writing one's own essay or thoughts. I love this book!"
3,average horror movie,"This movie is not too bad but not the greatest. It is about an old woman who is a mother of an engaged man who was about to introduce his pregnant girlfriend to his mother, unaware that she is a monster. The effects are not as brilliant, some scenes have a good plot so this isn't one of the best monster movies."
1,used book,The book was not new it was dented and several pages were highlighted.It was a Christmas gift to my wife and she was very disappointed.
2,Doesn't compare to The Cheerleader,"I first read The Cheerleader as a teenager and it was one of my all-time favorite books, one to be cherished. I wanted the story to go on and on so I was very happy when I found out 7 years after its publication about Snowy, the sequel. I hunted down a copy and read it in one night. After The Cheerleader, I found Snowy to be a let-down. The characters as adults weren't endearing. I couldn't relate to them at all. The life path that Snowy took seemed to totally conflict with the forces that shaped her teen-age years. Snowy develops an illness that seems totally out of character for her. It seemed to pop up out of nowhere. I did like the fact that the author brought some closure to Tom's and Snowy's relationship. I just wish it had happened in a different way."
3,Not practical for sitting it on your lap,"This product is great for standing up while you are getting your food. But it is not conducive for sitting on your lap. The handle and legs make it awkward. Also, not quite as solid or sturdy as I thought it would be.Still useful though."
5,Ingenious,My husband loves the convenience of taking his food and drink to the game room during ball games.
2,"I thouhgt it was 50,000 miles rehashed","I read his book ""After 50,000 Miles"" and liked it. I have some years of additional experience sailing since then. I didn't think this new book added much, even though the format was a bit different. As he often mentions, opinions vary. I don't agree with everything he says, but I do agree that experience, rather than reading about it, is the only way to find out what the realities of sailing are. Perhaps it is because I am experienced, but much of the book is what is obvious, or what is available in 100 other books on blue water sailing. I was excited when I got this book, but less excited with each page I turned. Good pictures and illustrations though."
5,One of the best Sailing Around the World books.,"There's lots of good books on sailing around the world, but so far this one is one of the best I have read. Each book has their good points, so it doesn't hurt to buy a few of them.There's so much to this book. Chapters on the advantages of sailing to see the world, finding a yacht, trip planning, sails, anchors, auto-pilots, sailing, storm management, food, engines, Foreign Paperwork, and much more.This author has logged many miles sailing, over many years and has written lots of books on the subject. I highly recommend you buy it, if you are the least interested in this subject."
5,Worthwhile Reading,One of the more enjoyable books I've read on the subject. It is well written and includes some unique and useful advice.
5,Valuable information.,"An excellent book full of valuable information gained from years of experience. It is well written and easy to understand, regardless of your level of expertise. A good addition to an sailor's library."
4,Great for Advanced Sailors,"I found the book to be very informative. It wasn't ideally what I was looking for but I accept that is an error on my part rather than on the writers. I am a novice to sailing and wanted to see how feasible the dream of sailing around the world, or at vey least to far away destinations with blue water passages, would be. But I found the book to be too technical in places for my level of understanding but would suit a more experienced seaman extremely well. I would have liked a few more more diagrams or at least an indexed section to explain some of the terms or more technical aspects a little more thoroughly especially in the sections where the writer falls off track and starts to offer what could be useful advice if I understood what he was on about. As I believe this is more down to my knowledge than the book I have still given it a strong 4."
3,old ideas,"It is a nice book but not the type of book I was looking for, updating a book is not adding a few lines with recent issues. Technical aspects not covered. I 'm still searching a good book on that issue."
2,Not that interesting,"I read through it more-a-less in one night and found it to be really dry. Just not really interesting to read. It did have some usfull information, but even that seemed somewhat out dated and fairly relative."
3,Not as funny as I'd hoped...,"As a long-time fan of MST3K, I looked forward to Mike Nelson's book from the moment I had heard he was working on it. I was sure the laughs would come long and hard. I was...really, kinda, sorta...disappointed.Not that it's not an amusing book. It is, it's just not as funny as I expected it to be. It certainly skewered the right films, and I appreciated Mike's admiration for Jackie Chan, but in all, it was merely amusing; it had none of the laughing so hard-I have tears coming rolling down my face-oh my side-damn, I think I've sprained my spleen- kind of laughs I had expected.Thankfully, for those kinds of laughs, I only have to go to another website. If you loved MST, I think you will enjoy Clevenger and Zollinger's take on the incredibly femmy action movies of the early 80's: MEGAFORCE and GYMKATA (a familiar title for msties everywhere<g>)"
2,Not like the Mike of MST3K...,"I was really excited when I heard about this book -- MST3K was one of my favorite TV shows of all time, and there's no pasttime I enjoy more than the skewering of bad movies. This book wasn't what I thought it would be, though -- a clever, insightful ribbing of lousy movies. It was much more mean-spirited than even your average MST3K episode, and a great deal of the criticism Nelson offered was of the ""I'm too good for this movie variety,"" which as far as I'm concerned, is NEVER valid criticism. He kept returning to the same comments over and over again... I swear, if he'd called someone ""doughy"" one more time I may have hurled the book through the window. And a lot of the personal attacks felt wholly unnecessary. I dunno. I guess without the filter of two brilliant robots, I just don't find Mike Nelson all that funny."
2,"Mega-cheesy, all right!!","I guess I expected something more along the lines of the MST3K Amazing Colossal Episode Guide. I expected a mega-size book for such a mega- title. But no! It's only about 5 1/2 by 8 inches, with a very large font, big margins, and widely spaced print lines. I also got the feeling that some of the ""reviews"" were padded in order to just get four lines on a new, otherwise blank page. That's the realization I came to while reading this book. Rather than be absorbed in the humor or writing, all I could think was, ""Geez, look at all the wasted space!"""
2,Disappointing,"As a huge MYSTY fan, I looked forward to Mike's book. To my disappointment, the book has a whining, nasty, and condescending tone, and it's simply not that funny. My dog-eared, well-worn copy of the Amazing MYSTY Episode Guide will not be challenged by this boring rant at obvious straw dogs and many who do not deserve Nelson's withering critques.I suppose the biggest question is, if all of these films are such an insult to Nelson's intelligence, why did he watch them? He's no longer forced to by Dr. Forrester. I noted that I did not bother to watch many of the pictures Nelson writes about. Makes me wonder who is smarter; him, or me."
1,The Printed Word is not Nelson's Forum,"I was very disappointed with this book. Being a huge Mystery Science Theatre Fan and finding Nelson's writing for that show to be near genius in its cleverness and resourcefulness, I was eager to read this book. Perhaps the book format just doesn't lend itself to his wit. I forced myself to struggle through a portion of the book, rarely giving up on a book I did give up on this one,it just was not funny or even mildly amusing. If you like MST3K, I recommend you stick with the tapes. Sorry Mike :("
2,"The higher they climb, the harder they fall...","I really didn't know what to make of this book. It seems like it is a stab at trying to ""MST"" the newer movies that the Satellite of Love either couldn't get the rights to do or didn't want to do. First the book goes to all lengths to segregate its audience. Before you buy this book make sure you are acquainted with 60% of the material in it or you will have a hard time going through it. Just like the MST show there are many references (or jokes), and unless you are really sharp with trivial insight you wouldn't understand this book. Then there is the effort of having to read Mike's pretentious, long winded ""critiques"" on each entry. Informative? No. Humourous? No. This book fails on many levels and Mr. Nelson (although I'm sure is a hell of a nice guy) should really think twice about a sequel."
4,Almost As Good As MST3K,"I laughed out loud a LOT while reading this. Way to go, Mike! He's still making fun of bad movies! And you will not believe the hidden SECRET Mike has been keeping from all of us!"
4,Like MST3K in print!,"If you love MST3K, you'll love this book. The difference is that Mike gets to lampoon big-budget stinkers like Independence Day, Volcano, and The Shadow instead of low-grade films. The humor is light and engaging as Mike punctures the pompous front of Hollywood."
3,"Amusing, but ....","5 Star ratings should be used sparingly. Mega Cheese is mildly amusing in a loose, disconnected way (it's a collection of articles with no unifying theme, btw); reminds me of something Dave Barry might put together in a Robitussin haze. I appreciate the fact that MST3K fans (cheated out of a GREAT show by Sci-fi Channnel suits) want to bolster Mike and anything MST3K related, but for long term's sake, be honest: MST3K did for bad movies what Monty Python did for comedy in general; individual minds together creating a sum greater than its parts; Mega Cheese is more on par with Erik the Viking. Get the MST3K AMAZING COLOSSAL book first."
2,A legend stumbles,"As head writer of the cult classic MST3K, Michael Nelson oversaw much of the unique, creative humor that defined MST3K. I purchased the ""Megacheese"" book figuring I'd find a pretty funny book. Unfortunately, this book is quite tedious. I think I laughed out loud about 3 times. I admit I'm hampered by a poor vocabluary, so reading his book with a dictionary alongside made it a difficult read at times. My guess is if Nelson covered more topics than movies, then the format of the book would work. Nelson comes across as a very bitter person who hates everything, instead of the witty man he really is(I suppose). So, if you want a book with a lot of rarely used words, a lot of humor that makes you think ""Hey, that is funny"", but not laugh, then buy this book. The best thing that has come out of this experience is that I want to read (and buy) his other book that just came out. If I don't like THAT book, I still have my tapes of MST3K to watch."
3,For MSTies Only,"As a devout and long-standing fan of TV's MST3K, it hurts me a little to give a book by head writer Mike Nelson anything less than a glowing review. And certainly humour is a quirky, subjective thing, so I wouldn't argue with the positive reviews here. But this book struck me as only mildly funny, and then only for fans of the now-cancelled TV show. Most of the writing has a tired, predictable feel to it, so unlike the TV show at its best, IMHO. But I'm someone who sat through any and all MST3K episodes, good and not-so-good. And this book was that way - not excellent, but enough of a MSTie fix to keep me reading. I hope there's a next and better book coming from Mike - I'll be reading that, too."
3,Recommended for MST3K fans only,"This is a collection of short movie reviews. I would guess that these particular reviews probably originally appeared in a local Minn. newspaper. As a fanatical MSTK viewer, this book was a mild disappointment to me. Although Nelson is a very good and funny writer, in this format the reviews appear quite repetitive and the selection of movies is certainly random.For MST3K fans, a much better book is the hilarious, chaotic, and colorful ""The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide"". ...."
3,Slightly disappointing,"When I think back on this book, I think of the word ""curmudgeon"". Mike and the rest of the MST writers took a good number of swipes at Andy Rooney (rightly so) for his mindless blather and smug conclusions. So it's strange to see Mike Nelson write a book that is every bit as curmudgeon-y as the bushy ""60 Minutes"" correspondent.The book has many flashes of brillance and great humor, but the overall tone is very negative. Yes, I know that the whole idea behind MST3K was to be negative and ""rip"" on the movies. But MST3K had a fizzy and good-natured air about it, like your goofy bachelor uncle. ""Megacheese"" makes me think about what that goofy uncle would be like if he had taken a dark and sobering turn in his life. He still would be witty and funny, but also grumpy and uncomfortably sneerish.Despite my misgivings, I would still recommend the book. Just be aware that this book is a lot more of the ""laughing at"" than MST3K's ""laughing with""."
2,Read Mind Over Matters instead,"Mike's book ""Mind Over Matters"" is a book of hilariously-written essays about experiences of his own personal life. I've read it so many times it may be considered unhealthy. That's why I was so disappointed with Megacheese. I don't want to give the impression that I don't ""get"" his dry-wit writing style, I love it. And I was hoping that he would rip apart blockbuster movies and overrated actors in glorious detail but instead leaves us with, ""This movie is bad, it's really bad."" I wish it were filled with more specifics. It was all I could do to finish this book. But since this was his first, maybe he's just getting better with each one. I look forward to Death Rat."
4,I LOVE MST3K,"And this book was pretty good too, though a bit much at times. Mike can lay the sarcasm on a trifle TOO thick in some places. Other than that, it's just as irreverent, biting and humorous as the show, though I reccomend it in small, easily managed doses."
2,A missed opportunity,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. In this age of sky-high P/Es, I wanted Mr. Neff's guidance on picking high-quality low-P/E stocks. After all, the man's track record speaks for itself. Unfortunately, Mr. Neff is far too terse in his descriptions of what he looks for in companies. He offers hints, but fails to deliver the analytical tools to implement his strategies. The book would have greatly benefitted from some in-depth case studies. Instead, one finds one- or two-paragraph thumbnail sketches. I suggest you skim through this book in a store before plunking down your hard-earned cash for it."
3,Not bad,"If you've read a lot of books about value investing, then you may not get that much out of this book, although I did like reading it. The reasoning for buying value stocks is well described, with plenty of examples of why particular securities were bought and sold, which I found to be useful and interesting. One would need to learn more detailed security analysis from other books, however, since this book doesn't teach you things like balance sheet and cash flow analysis etc. I'd also recommend The Intellegent Investor, and Graham and Dodd's book Security Analysis."
5,John Neff on Investing,"A life experience about investing in stocks from one of the best investors, in simple words."
1,Disappointing,"Not much insight here. If you enjoy the history of a professional's stock picks, fine......Read it. But otherwise very boring and lacking in explaining Neff's techniques of investment analysis."
2,Rather disappointing,"As I read many books of famous investors, I was quite disappointed by this book. For starters, the record of John Neff is far from stellar and does not come close to the record of e.g. Peter Lynch, as he beat the market with a mere 3%. Adding to this, the content of this book is very superficial and does not give any further insights into investing. His advice is rather straightforward and pales to advices that can be found in other books (e.g. Common stocks and uncommon profits of Philip Fisher). Half of the book is devoted to a rather boring description of his actions over the time he managed his fund. In short: not really advisable for someone who counts on finding information that should supplement the information found in other books, although tyros in the field may have another opinion."
5,EXCELLENT CASE STUDIES IN CHILD WELFARE,"Dr. Brown has assembled a terrific collection of case studies in child welfare. The cases are diverse, and the author's introductions and comments help students to see the perspectives of the various actors in the studies. An excellent resource for social work, human services, nursing, and other professions."
2,weird,this product has a weird after taste i wonder if the honey has spoiled. wish i could have brought one bottle
5,excellent book,I am a Pediatrician working in a busy ER and this book captures the imaginations of children perfectly. Its wonderfully illustrated and has a design and story that really allow for interaction between the child and the reader. Highly recommended.
5,cole porter's true rarity,"This recording seems to follow the score as exactly written by Cole Porter, with no orchestrations, and is a great opportunity to know how worked the american master. The arrangement of 'The leader of a big time band' differs a little with the one I've heard conducted by maestro Mc Glinn, but when Cole Porter writes for piano a score with color, less than what's meant for a 'serious' composer, it is exactly reflected in the orchestrations of Robert Russel Bennet, his major musical mentor. Other orchestrators destroy literally the original score."
3,Strictly Anglophile,"If you want a totally anglophile look at the history of the Scottish War of Independence, you'll get it here. Ms. Plaidy is a talented writer but totally unable to comprehend that others might not consider being conquered and slaughtered (Berwick anyone? the slaughter of the Welsh bards?) a benevolent act."
1,Monstrosity,"Although it's well written, the characters demonstrate the worst side of human nature. Rozzy is a victim and all the rest are just plain mean spirited. This book provokes and invokes anger. Skip it."
1,"Tough, like gristles on meat","This story has characters etched in jagged glass. This book is about the cruel and cutting edge personalities. The author writes well, but this cast of characters have no saving grace.The best parts were the descriptions of Boston in the 1960s and 1970s. Anyone familiar with beautiful Boston would at least appreciate that.It's a lucky thing this is a ""self-contained"" story. It would be a disservice to the world at large if those rotten Hillys, Beas, Bens and Besses came back to haunt you from another book. Like a gristle, this book is hard and tough. Like a gristle, it isn't palatable. Read something else instead."
1,"Atrocious, appalling release! A complete rip-off!!! Do not buy it!","What a shame that this good film has been ruined on this DVD, released by a dismal Dutch company (Dutch Filmworks)! I just bought it from an amazon seller and am immediately in the process of getting a refund. Firstly, the film has been edited in at least five places. The running time is said here, and on the back cover to be 98 minutes but is actually less than 96 minutes, with over 2 minutes of footage missing! The picture is slightly below average DVD quality but that would not have been an issue for me if the film had not been butchered by that stupid Dutch label. Every good part of the film has been removed and thus all enjoyment of the film lost with this DVD. If you have bought a copy, get your money back! You are entitled to under worldwide consumer law."
3,but seriously,"I'll be honest - I only got this because it has Joanna Cassidy's greatest nude scene. Vadim, a very voyeuristic director, is content to sit the camera in front of her bare butt and just leave it there. Fine by me. More engaging than the entirety of Alexander. If the product description sounds a bit bizarre, the movie is more so. Actually, more like a fever dream than an erotic thriller. A plot summary of a senseless movie is senseless so I'll just say: Joanna, good work!"
4,One of the best Americana releases of the year,"This is classic honky tonk with a keene modern eye. Produced by the legendary Dan Penn (whose songs the band covers), this is music of rare beauty. Soulful and sincere, the brother's version of Charlie Rich's ""Life Has it's Little Ups and Downs"" nearly upstages the original. Fans of Hank Sr., Gram Parsons and even Al Green and the Stones need this cd. It's that good."
2,little disapointed,"WELL I WAS EXPECTING A BETTER ALBUM THAN THIS. I ENJOYED THERE LAST ONE, BUT WAS EXTREMELY DISAPOINTED IN THIS ONE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STEAL GUITARS AND THE CLASSIC COUNTRY HONKY-TONK SOUND. THIS ALBUM IS VERY WEAK AND I REGRET PURCHASING IT. MANY OF THE TRACKS ARE SLOW AND UNINTERESTING. A REAL BORE. THIS REALLY MAKES ME THINK BEFORE BUYING ANOTHER HACIENDA BROTHERS ALBUM AGAIN."
4,A good intro Yoga tape,"I bought this tape because I want to improve my flexibility without making a 1-hour long commitment every time I sit down to do it. Some of the poses are difficult for me, but I am just starting out and expected a bit of a challenge. Kathy takes her time with each pose and doesn't rush, so there is plenty of time to check that you are doing it correctly and don't hurt yourself. If you want to try Yoga, but find most of the tapes out there are more than you want to jump into right now, then this is a good tape to help you begin."
4,Does the Job,"The capacity is not great, but it gets the job done. It works just fine for a home office and does not look too horrible sitting on your desk. Overall, it's a standard 3 hole punch for a pretty good price."
3,It works,"It does the job adequately, with few minor issues. I find the rubber bottom slips off occasionally spilling the contents all over. There is no leeway with the 10 page limit. Do not try to punch 11 pages! I would prefer something a little more heavy duty, but for the occasional hole punching this would work just fine."
5,Great paper punch!,"This definitely gets the job done! It's a little bulkier than my old paper punch, but the wide base makes it stable. It's very easy to use and punches the holes cleanly."
2,only in my rear view mirror,"This is a perfectly adequate hole punch.But unless you have space issues, pay a little more and buy the much better 'Light Touch' hole punch by the same manufactorer. It's infinitely better.Progress happens sometimes."
2,Silly and Shallow,"genre: fantasyThe 2-star rating is for literary quality.This is Roscoe's fluid, conversational, and entertaining account of the outcome of eating at a fast food restaurant built on contaminated property that could well be designated a superfund, toxic waste site.Characterization vaguely mimics Roald Dahl's style but is otherwise very flat. Silly names. The plot has suspense but is spare in development. Marginal slapstick.Reading Roscoe's tale is like watching a Bullwinkle cartoon.The book's big merit is that it will be a magnet for recreational reading; especially 8 - 10 year old boys who are on the reluctant side as readers and have beginning experience with chapter books. It has a place on the classroom shelf."
5,Instant Classic,"I've bought this book for every mid-grade child I know, and it's become everyone's favorite book. A fabulous gift, and instant classic."
3,Do not last well,"Okay I thought these rubber hoods were great for the price and lets be honest they were not bad, bought them in late January 2011 and by August they had split, both did the same at almost the same time (I got two for both of my lenses). So just be aware."
2,Getting what you pay for,"I've placed this on my Nikon D40 and it creates a small vignette around the edges on my 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens. It fits on well, but doesn't extend as far as I wish it would.It is made of rubber so I'm not concerned with it falling apart or breaking; but it might be just a safety piece. Better a small rubber hood than nothing."
5,A must have for touring musicians!,"This book is great. My company currently handles booking for touring bands, and the contact information is among the best you can find anywhere. They supply you with not only a name and number for the venues, but you also get important information like capacity, stage size, genres of music they book and names of people that can actually get your bands booked. I highly recommed this to anyone in the business who is touring or looking to tour. They also provide information for record labels, distribution, radio stations, music stores and publications to help promote and market your product. This book is a must have for all working musicians!"
3,light weight sturdy easy to assemble,Light weight easy to carry parts upstairs to assemble did not carry wholebox up. Reasonably sturdy but not for small children or large people. With mattress in place A little difficult to return to seating position because of the light weight a bit tricky with 1 person. Metal frame for mattress came a little dammaged(dented and end cap loose) but not enough to send it back or restrict function. Futon mattress was purchased seperatly came 3 days after.
1,textbridge pro 11 is not worth it,"I purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer. The document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that I simply had to re-type. It would have taken longer to correct than to re-type. When I talked to Textbridge about these problems all they would tell me is that the program was not meant for such use and that I should buy one of their other programs which had good optical character recognition capabilities. In other words, they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it. The program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else."
1,Horrible is a Compliment,"This product simply does not produce accurate results. It skips entire lines, words on the same line, and misreads even the most legible characters. It came bundled with my scanner, so at least I did not waste my money on it. Don't waste yours!"
2,Textbridge Pro11,"This is a great programme with Windows XP but be aware that it conflicts with Vista,the latest version of Windows. An upgrade is recommended by Nuance,the manufacturer to OmniPage at double the cost of Textbridge."
4,Text Bridge - Works for me,"Performs as advertised out of the box. Beats having to retype old docs.Struggles to compensate for partly broken letters or faded type.Knowing all of this, I'd buy it again."
3,Good technical reference book for its day.,I bought this book in 2005 when I needed a reference to learn the use of SAP Smart forms. The book was a good technical reference at the time. The product is now obsolete but the author might produce a satisfactory reference forthe new Adobe Smart Forms product.
4,A nice alternative to Bose,"If you have been looking for small cube speakers, KLH are the way to go. They beat Bose every time and sell for considerably less money.These speakers are best used as satellites or tweeters. They aren't big enough to reproduce the mid-range well. They are, however, better constructed than Bose and are better suited for the mid-range than Bose cube speakers.If you are looking for a complete set of speakers for your surround system and have been considering an expensive Bose set, check out Onyoko and Boston Acoustics. KLH can't compete with the expensive speakers from good companies.But if you have been poised to buy the Bose cubes, you will be better off with KLH. I like them very much and my wallet appreciates them, too. I would buy them again in an instant."
4,Works great but the lower priced WHITE one works as well,"In my opinion, buying the cheaper white SkyLink motion sensor is a better choice. It WILL work with any SkyLink alarm in spite of some retailers claiming it won't (so you'll buy more expensive one).Save your money and buy the WHITE ones! Besides, how many people have GRAY walls? White goes better with wall paint."
3,Smells Great but not Lasting,"This is very similar to Dyptique Phylosikos, but not nearly as bright and complex. Zip on the staying power. You're better off spraying your clothes for any lasting effect and you'll still need to reapply several times a day. having said that, the Dypt is the same way but at maybe 6-8 times the cost of Demeter. The Demeter is a bit more soft than the Dypt and I think more wearable. A great perfume for someone like me who doesn't like perfume especially florals, and doesn't want to smell like laundry detergent or food. It really smells like you would if you'd been walking through fig trees- fresh, spring, plantlike. I'm on here now looking for lotions and such for layering."
4,"Nice, but not quite what I expected","I was under the impression, from the descriptions of the product line, that this cologne would smell like what it's called; i.e., grass. I was expecting something with a smell like fresh-cut grass. While it's a nice scent - it's lightly floral and long-lasting - it doesn't smell like grass. I'm a bit disappointed even though I do like whatever scent this actually is."
3,Nice DVD for change of scenery,"First, I have to say the scenery is lovely and the music is acceptable. However, this DVD was promoted as a ""bike ride"" through California Wine Country. It actually appears to have been filmed from a moving vehicle at speeds of at least 25-30 mph, which is not a ""bike ride"". There is no speed adjustments for climbing up grades or riding down hills. I ride my bike so I can take time to enjoy the scenery as I ride vs. speeding by in a car. The filming speed of this DVD takes away the enjoyment of the ride. I am not sure I would recommend this DVD to a friend."
3,Cycling and Sipping!,Nice way to pass the time when exercising. Nice music. Beautiful scenery but save the sipping until afte cycling.
3,Fair,"Was a little disapointed with the video. Expected more of a Actual ""Ride Experience"" video. Found it to be more of a sight seeing video."
3,Good Video Music needs Improving,"I have 5 Bike O Vision DVD's and the scenery is awesome but the use and reuse of the same classical music in different DVD'sreally is a let down. I thought this video in particular was tedious. I'm an older guy, but come on, give me some jazz or anythingwith a beat. This was not motivating at all."
2,"Great for motivation, but lacking in real content","The first 6 chapters of this book are made up of mostly quotes from runners. These are not always particularly insightful or helpful. I found it to have far, far too many of those, ""well, DUH!"" kind of comments. Not much detail or specifics at least in the first part of the book. I finally found something worth reading in the seventh chapter but by that point I was so annoyed that I didn't care. Needed editing. Others are better."
3,Commonwealth Air Training,"Dreadful story line, ham acting - but if you were a British Commonwealth Air Training Scheme trainee and/or instructor, as I was, this film is a must. The actual flying scenes are excellent, those concocted in the studio appalling. And what a privilege, to see Air Marshal Billy Bishop impersonating Air Matshal Billy Bisho[!"
4,Cagney and Technicolor,"Cagney's 1st Technicolor film. Wow! The vivid scenes of Canada's beautiful and rugged areas plus the aerial scenes with the planes were simply outstanding. Director Michael Curtiz consistently put out very entertaining films (e.g; Robin Hood, Casablanca, etc.) and deserves more recognition for his work. I have read negative comments about the plot. I personally enjoyed it. Watching Cagney is so fun and invigorating. And I love watching Alan Hale. He is one of my all time favorite character actors. Anyway, in these troubling times, relax, let your hair down, and enjoy this patriotic WWII movie for what it is. It's great escapism. Past the popcorn."
5,Kirkwood a great songwriter,"Curt Kirkwood has always given us a unique vernacular in his brand of songwriting, since the early '80's country-punk of the Meat Puppets (something that Kurt Cobain recognized & promoted). If you enjoyed the acoustic side of the Pups in ""Coming Down"" or ""Shine"" (from the Too High To Die LP) then you'll like this. Snow is a very gentle, poetic, even sweet, country-acoustic mix. Some of the songs have a very light touch, while ""Box of Limes"" stands out as a more aggressive toe-tapper. All the songs seem to have their own internal momentum that gathers force and releases energy, however subdued. And there's always little surprises in the lyrics. My only criticism is that Curt's voice sometimes sounds flat or off-key, but if you look past that you'll enjoy every song on the album as I do."
1,Saccharine Isn't As Sweet,"I've met and respected the Beers for a number of years. Their story is an inspiration. That being said one half of two other couples chronicled in the book worked with me at a local television station. (One has since moved on hint hint) Let's just say that to use the term ""glossed over"" is putting it mildly. If you want cute little stories that make you feel warm and fuzzy then by all means buy the book. If on the other hand you want to feel like you really got to know the couples featured forget about it. My significant other thought it was ""romantic"" especially since there were coworkers involved. Yuck! Rent a chick flick instead and save the $ difference. At least then you know you're ingesting fiction."
4,Common Sense Approach To Training Your Dog,I found this book to be quite useful. The author lays it out in a common sense sort of approach that really makes sense for the most part. I have goats not cattle though and it is very cattle specific so I cannot use some of the stuff in there.
2,Not quite sure,"It has been one week since the latest date the book should have arrived and it is still missing. I have contacted the seller and they merely told me they mailed it. The book itself is good, I've been reading another copy. My seller did not seem keen on assisting me at all."
5,CAN'T GO WRONG WITH HURRICANE PAULINA RUBIO...,"SHE'S A VERY TALENTED, STRONG, CONFIDENT, SPUNKY LATINA LADY THAT CAN REALLY SING[!] I HAVE ALL HER ALBUMS (SPANISH/ENGLISH) AND I'M VERY VERY VERY IMPRESSED WITH BORDER GIRL. I THINK HER ENGLISH IS MUCH BETTER THAN SHAKIRA'S[!] I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM AND ALL HER PREVIOUS ALBUMS BECAUSE THEY ARE GREAT TUNES[!] PAULINA IS A TRUE ARTIST[!]"
2,"She is good, But not singing in english!","I have all her cds in spanish. I think she is a talented artist, but her jump to english is not that good. Just like Shakira you hardly can understand what she is saying. Sorry, Pau."
1,Don't Buy This Product,"Purchased this product as I have bought several of these in the past few years. After the first use, I hand washed the garment and then hung it up to dry. The outer layer started peeling off and the zipper broke. I had to discard this after(1) use. I will not purchase this garment again."
3,Doc Savage to the rescue!,"Kenneth Robeson's classic pulp hero investigates the mystery behind the disappearences of important men who have reportedly been abducted by someone calling himself the Man on the Moon and imprisoned in a base on that satellite. His five assistants, each an expert at their specialty, join in, as does Doc's cousin, Pat. Muscular prose and plenty of action keep this one moving along nicely, but the central puzzle just isn't very interesting. And although this book was written well before the Apollo moon landings, I was shocked at the ignorance of probable lunar surface conditions by such an assemblage of supposedly great minds. Did we really know so little about the moon then?"
4,Pearls...manageable daily wisdom!,"I have read several of the Love & Logic books & decided to give this book a place on my shelf. It's loaded with bits of wisdom, tools & encouragement to help with everyday situations. Whether you are a parent, a teacher, a coworker, a manager or all of the above, this book will help in many issues that arise & give you confidence to handle things logically AND with love!Putting these principles into bite-sized pieces helps you achieve gradual understanding in the love & logic principles as well as making them a part of your life, permanently."
5,Nice cookie sheets,Haven't cooked on them yet but these are very substantial sheets with a very glossy finish. Has edges that allow for things to be slid off which seems like a good idea for saving time. Makes me want to bake just feeling the weight of them.
4,Excellent,"This honey is thick, with great flavor and very sweet. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that there is no mention on the packaging whether it's been pasteurized or not."
2,Editors take note!,"Unbelievably, this book is littered with spelling mistakes. The content in the first four steps may insult your intelligence, as will the highlighted examples. Some useful information can be gained in the latter steps. The overall concept is interesting and important."
4,It should be on Kindle,"I read this book, and others by Golden, more than 50 years ago. Still, I remember how much I enjoyed it. The book contains a very large number of short pieces about some aspect of American life, always with a unique or particularly interesting twist. They were authentic, and mostly true stories. Each offered some kind of ""lesson"" for living, but not in the usual stupid style. As a young scientist, I was very much into objectivity, and not much into homilies or platitudes, and these were not of that kind. It is nice to have a book to read and enjoy, without feeling a compulsion to finish it to see what happens next. You get to ""finish"" parts of it quite often. :-)"
1,Waste of Time,"As a student, in my experience, the majority of students find this lab manual nothing but demoralizing, especially as a fresh beginning student. The soundtracks for the audio exercises are too fast for people not accustomed to the vowel nature of this language. While it could be argued that this requires students to listen repeatedly to the tracks...in most cases they will simply get the answers in the back of this book so that they have time to do the workbook, memorize things from the textbook, and look on the internet for other forms of audio that are more acquainted to their listening level.If you insist on getting this book or are required to get it, make sure to get a soundplayer that allows you to slow down the audiotracks."
1,CHEAP TOY for KIDS...NOT FOR MATURE SERIOUS COLLECTORS,"If you are a Professional, Mature Adult Die-Cast Model Car collector, do NOT EVER buy Mattel = Hot Wheel Brands. They are good at manipulating money and produce cheap crap to ripp you off. Look for CLASSY brands such as BBR, BRUMM, MAKE UP, IXO, KYOSHO, and so on who takes HIGH pride in their product, NOT so GREEDY and JUNKY like HOT WHEELS. I will NEVER buy this brands."
2,Horrible Experience,"After buying and opening this toy, Trish's arm fell off and Christian's waist began to rattle. Also, Trish's shirt doesnt stay on and you can constantly see her bra. You are forewarned. (...)"
5,Club profusion,"No doubt, Madge is the eternal queen of the dancefloors!!! Her 33rd #1 dance single is full of feel-good remixes of her precious new song, Love Profusion, and also includes a Nthing Fails remix as a bonus track. What are you waiting for? Love the Passengerz, Blow Up and Ralphi Rosario Mixes!!!"
2,Modest Madonna... Profusion?,"Madonna's latest single went not so noticed here in Asia. In a place where she is virtually known, they gave a cold acceptance of the legend's ""Love Profusion"". The song has very uplifting lyrics. Very nice and carefully written but Madonna's image didn't quite carry this tune successfully. This is much more of a ballad fit for a Tina Arena or Mariah Carey, and we all know that Madonna doesn't have the range or the vocal abilities to make it a power ballad. The video is much different as it shows a different and modest Madonna. Average attempt for the Queen of Pop!"
2,"1,2,3,4 MAYBE THIS IS IT?","Ok, another American Life release single, the video is not that bad but not at Madonna's height. Madonna's videos has always been vanguard, innovative and had the word timeless all over the place, but this video it's just average. Now the song has strong message and the original beat are just ok, sad that a song from Madonna has become just that ok, not really grosse or really good, or shocking, Madonna's tracks are now comapre somehow to Whitney's that it's sad, I wonder how Madonna it's going to pick up after this flop. In no way compare to the Erotica's judge by the public, this albums wasn't judge, wasn't looked, wasn't noticed, worse was indifrent to the people and radio how sad."
1,Madonna in Crisis!!!!! Love Decadence!!!!,Love Profusion SUCKS!!!!! First because sounds the same as all Madonna singles and she MOANS more than sings. Another REMIX that after few weeks will go into the trash can. Love Profusion SUCKS because Madonna shows all her IMMATURITY as singer!!!! At 46 still sings like a teen girl. I waisted my money!!!! I will donate this CD to the salvation army.
2,"Nice song, bad remixes","Another song of Madonna that hasn't been remixed properly:( I bought it, hoping for at least 4 good mixes (out of 6 available). Unfortunately, I was wrong.The best is rosario's house mix and passengerz club. That's all. The rest is more or less avarage. If you really like this tune, buy one of the european editions, than you will not get tired with this lovely song."
2,not so great,I bought this book since it seemed like a good overview of social movements. It turns out that it is a collection of a bunch of articles that are in all honesty not very interesting. I feel that the editor tried to do so much that he failed at doing anything with the book.
2,soundproofing...not much more,"Half the book talks about soundproofing, a quarter on VERY basic wiring, and a quarter on a glossary. It's miniature too-the size of a passport. Not a good basic overview of studio design."
2,"Too ""basic"" ...","Not enough graphics, seems to talk from theory not experience, huge glossary but no UK-US terms translation, missing detail drawings when describing soundproofing assemblies - one nail or screw in the wrong place and it will not work. Some concepts are plain wrong or badly described. Read with caution!"
3,Its not the best but....,"So far my only gripe is that is a minature book. I was expecting a regular sized book to read, and didnt know it was a pocket book. It appears to be very informal."
5,"Excellent, must-read","A beautifully written novel about love between a white British woman and a black man from Senegal. The two meet in school, and against all odds and family and cultural prejudices, finally marry. When things go wrong deeply held beliefs are challenged and the reader is shown the ""other side of the story."" Paradoxes are revealed, allowing the reader to think critically about serious issues of race, prejudice, marriage, fidelity, and more.This novel was recommended by an IB DP English language teacher I work with, and I agree. I highly recommend it for high school (age 16 & up) and university reading lists. Translated from the French."
3,Interesting,Not very believable but story and the acting makes it worth watching.Aidan Quinn is very good even in borderline roles.
4,...and you know who is in there don't you!,"... A spaceship lands on a planet beside another ship that went down some time before. The crew is your usual gang of idiots. We have an Alan Thicke look-a-like. the cocky youngster who thinks hes indestructable and a bimbo. Some others too. anyway, the bimbo goes missing and soon re-appears outside the ship with no spacesuit..shes also naked. Thinking this peculiar, one of the genius's goes out after her and he also goes missing. Their signals are located by the remaining crew in the other ship...Something evil awaits the crew as they board the other ship to find the missing crewmates.I have seen a lot worse than creature. It deserves a look."
4,under rated treat,"creature is an underated sci-fi film. it has cult favorite written all over it. if you are a fan of early -mid eighties horror films then this film is worth buying. the special effects are second rate, but it was made in 1984. the story is actually very good.this film has in it a hidden gem. legendary actor klaus kinski has a small but interesting part in this film. he makes the film twice as interesting once he does appear. he had a talent for just that ability in several films he appeared in.it would have been better if kinski's role had been bigger and if the film makers had been able to use him more. over all i highly recommend this film."
5,A popcorn lover's favorite,"My husband and I are big fans of cheddar cheese popcorn. If you are, too -- please be aware that this one is the best you will ever eat. This popcorn has just the right amount of cheese. You start chewing the kernels and they are so luscious, they melt in your mouth."
5,Tremors for Tremor-maniacs,All the grabboids and ass-blasters that your little heart desires. Campy sometimes silly series of movies about prehistoric creatures and a core group of people who learn to capitolize on them to save their little deadend town.Good light hearted entertainment.
3,Something dissapoint me,"Well I bouhght movies cause I liked the first two, the other movies didn't knew about them, so Ithoguht this would be a good oportunity to have a collection, so I ordered.My dissapointment was on the third movie, which doesn't have subtitles, I mean, I understand english (I think that) but I think this an entertaiment, so it is better to have it on my language; if I wanted to practice my english, I'll take lessons.After that everything is great."
3,Tremors-AttackPack,"Pretty happy with the DVDs. They were a little dirty and the 1st dvd was skipping when we first put in. But they cleaned up alright. My son was very happy to receive them on Christmas. Overall, I would have been happier if NOTHING had been wrong with the dvds.Merryjo"
4,Tremors Rocks for Tween Boys!,"My son adores the Tremors movies, and spent lots of time on YouTube watching clips from the sequels until he received this Tremors AttackPack for Christmas. Now he's off one screen and onto another, and making up his own Tremors games and graboids. Who says video screens dull the imagination?"
4,You've gotta love these bad movies...,"If you've seen one of these movies its likely you've seen them all. And their utter badness is what makes them such classics to own. This is by far the best way to buy them, too. Four movies in one box, you cant get this kind of deal with any other series of films, that's for sure. And the best part about these films, like with the recent film Slither, is thee humor that goes right along. These are not staged horror films, but what could be real people's real reactions to seeing giant monsters. The first is my favorite, and in some people opinion the second might be better... and the third, well the name of the monsters in that movie is priceless, and the fourth, well most historical movies tend to bore me, but its worth seeing how to combat monsters in the old west. If you love sci-fi thats so bad its good than get these!"
4,Great for sci-fi fans,"This is a really good product, especially for the price. It's a good idea for sci-fi fans. When I got mine, one of the discs was defective, but returning it was no big deal. The second movie is definetly the best, then the first, then the third. The fourth one isn't something I'd pay money for, but it's okay in a box set."
5,"Silly, exciting fun","Part One, classic Bacon at his finest! Michael Gross and Reba McEntire join Bacon in turning a potentially stale monster flick into a roller coaster fun classic. Michael Gross, the constant in the series, throws his Keaton image to the wind to create a hilarious character in an ever-evolving arc of a fine mix of thrills, chills, drama, comedy, and wickedly good effects. The series perhaps would have been best left a trilogy, but the fourth installment, and following short-lived television show, proved a relatively simple idea, man against ""nature,"" can take on a life of its own and never disappoint. Perhaps the most impressive? These are ridiculously 50's horror in nature, but timeless in entertainment."
5,"Greetings from Perfection,NV","At last! A four pack loaded with more Grabiods than you can shoot at! Burt Gummer would agree: get the most bang for you buck! And at a price that won't kill your wallet. In Tremors 4 it's Rejection,NV circa 1880's Nevada. See how they changed the name of the town to Perfection. You'll see Burt's great grand-dad Hiram with a gatlin gun, albeit at theend of the film, but the Tremors 4-pack shows just how important our 2ndAmendment rights truly are! Silly? Ok, but excellent sci-fi entertainment"
4,Irritating,"Just a short review of the DVD set itself and NOT the movies: There were featurettes, deleted scenes and a short film on the original DVD of ""Tremors 4: The Legend Begins"", but they are, for no reason at all, not included in this Attack Pack (you only get one of the featurettes and an audio commentary). The Attack Pack also contains two double-sided flippers, not four discs.However, the upside is that the first two films, ""Tremors"" and ""Tremors 2: Aftershocks"" are both anamorphically enhanced in this set, which they are not on standard, stand-alone DVD, and all bonus features for the first three movies ARE included.I NOTICED THE MOST HELPFUL REVIEW FOR THIS PRODUCT STATES THAT THE FILMS ARE ALL NON-ANAMORPHIC! THIS IS NOT TRUE! THEY ARE ANAMORPHICALLY ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TELEVISIONS!"
4,good monster movie of it's time,"I fully expected a movie about killer worms to be corny, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually a good thriller action movie. Yes the tenticles coming from the beast is a little laughable, but none the less still a good movie.I remember when I was a kid watching this movie that I was scared. It brings back memories."
3,Good movie,The movie itself was good but two of the tapes were warped. Tremors the legend was best it should have been tremors one.
3,it was more funny than anything,well im kinda a horror movie fan sooo... I was a slight bit dissapointed about it not being any horror on these films but on the bright side i got a good laugh off them and after the 2nd one i really couldnt get into the other two like that i need to find a edge of your seat horror movie any suggestions
3,funny,I really liked this movie. it was funny and kind of dorky but it was alot of fun to watch. All the ingredients for a good old fashioned sci fi movie. It has action as Kevin B. and Fred W. make a good cominic duo and add Fred G. and Reba M. as the survivalists. If u don't own u should and if by some odd chance u have missed it on sunday afternoons u should watch it.
3,Tremors Box Set,"The first Tremors has always been a family favorite. It's funny, somewhat clever, and just plain entertaining. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have great chemistry, and they are the single reason the movie is any good. We had trouble finding Tremors 2, which is why I bought the box set. Not as good as the first, but still pretty entertaining. No Kevin Bacon, but Fred Ward stars. Tremors 3 is not as good as 2, and I slept through Tremors 4. No Bacon or Ward in either of the final 2."
4,3 out of four are good movies,"If you are planing on buying this box set, buy it for Tremors 4, 1, and 2. Tremors 1 was a very good movie, Tremors 2: Aftershocks was five times better, Tremors 3: Back To Perfection is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and Tremors 4: The Ledgend Begins was an amazing prequel that brought the series back with a bang! Tremors is one of the stries that should have stopped going forward with story after the second one. Watch these in the order of 4, 1, and 2."
4,"Scary, Silly FUN!","While the original was the best, all the TREMORS movies are FUN! Somewhat predictable and silly, but pure ENTERTAINMENT! That's what it's all about!"
4,good fun!,"I thought the first ""Tremors"" movie was a lot of fun, kind of a throwback to the 50's monster movies. The other films have their moments but overall you can see where the the cuts in their budgets hurt their quality. I like these movies, and encourage you to watch them for a good laugh."
2,Only #1 and #3 Are Worth Seeing,Only DVD #1 and #3 are worth seeing. #2 They tried to replace Kevin Bacon with some other actor and it was painful to watch the failure. #4 Was a travel back to the wildwest and was absurd; not worth your time.
5,Horror and Comey!! It doesn't get any better than this!!!,"There are already many reviews applauding this series so I'll just say that this is good corny, cheesy, bucket of popcorn fun for the whole family. I love this instant classic. A must have!!!!!"
2,Original still the best,I wanted to own all of the tremors series. It was for that reason I purchased the attack pack. The first one is great the others pale in comparison. Stick with the original and be happy.
1,Tremors for the true fans!,"Got the Attack Pack and was not disappointed. Although the 3rd. rendition and the Prequel left much to be desired, its a great addition for any Tremors fan to have in their collection. The transfers were great as was the audio.Thumbs up for the Attack Pack!"
5,Classic,"This series has been my favorite since i was a little kid. Even though its classified as a ""horror"", i think of it as a comedy. They have alot of comic relief."
4,amazing!,i was only expecting the first movie to find out that i got all four :) i couldnt be more happier
5,A terrific new Fung-Shui book.,"I have read quite a few fung shui books and this is one of the most informative and entertaining that I have encountered. I found it concise, easy to read, and laid out in a very logical manner. I highly recommend Fung Shui: Back to Balance for those approaching fung shui for the first time as well as those who have been intimidated by past experiences with the subject. Ms. Fretwell (the author) has inspired me to clean up my office and my house!"
4,Slightly confusing,"Like most feng shui books, this one is short. While most of the discussion was very clearcut and to the point, some of it was definitely the psychology of muddy reasoning that I found confusing. However, my bedroom makeover turned out fantastic, and every time I'm in the room, I feel happy.I loaned this book to a friend, who in turn, loaned it to her daughter. They are also happy with their results."
3,"Bette Davis does ""light and frothy"" just as well as she does ""serious and riveting""","Nonsense, but perfectly watchable nonsense. Probably the most notable thing about this featherweight souffle is watching how effortlessly Bette Davis moved from her usual heavier, nuanced dramatic performances to an effective light, comic role, complete with recurring sight gag where she repeatedly falls down into a cactus and gets needles stuck in her behind. Similarly, it's also fun to see James Cagney do light and goofy just as well as he does steely and dangerous, his usual forte at the time.Don't expect too much out of ""The Bride Came C.O.D."" and you'll likely enjoy it well enough. The DVD features a crisp, sharp picture and a nice selection of extra features."
4,Just a fun movie,My wife had seen this once and enjoyed it. When I saw it was available Ordered it for her. She really enjoyed it. The story is totally unbelievable but if you suspend belief its' just fun to watch Cagney and Davis interact with each other.
3,"Cactuses Are Sharp, But Not the Comedy","James Cagney stars as a pilot who agrees to ""kidnap"" the daughter of an oilman as she is about to elope and fly her to him before the marriage can happen. He will be paid ten dollars a pound for her, money he needs to keep his plane from being re-possessed. Bette Davis stars as the oil heiress and Jack Carson (did he ever actually get the girl in a movie?) is her singer-fiance who wants the publicity their marriage will bring. I can't say this is the funniest comedy I've ever seen. Davis spends most of the movie hollering and getting cactus needles pulled from her backside. It's a far cry from the kind of films for which she's usually remembered. This isn't Cagney's best work either, although he appears to be having fun. There are some fun moments, but you tend to expect more from a star pairing like this. Fans of these to great actors (like me) should watch this film, even though it is little more than a footnote in their careers."
4,What does it mean?,"At first you think this is a comical book, however, as you read into it, you find that it is actually a saga you can relate to. Similiar to a Sunday dinner with the ""not so normal"" relatives. I found the book to be entertaining, with a hidden hint of reality. I found myself thinking, he couldn't have just written that. As it outlines the oddities, I think it actually hits on the here and now. It made me wonder."
5,Informative and Entertaining,"As an attorney familiar with the Social Security claims process, I found the story very realistic. In fact it is so realistic, I have my doubts if it really is fiction.Since I wasn't expecting a serious novel, I wasn't disappointed when the book didn't read like a John Grisham story. I was able to finish it in 3 hours and I couldn't help smiling the entire time.If I was a claimant with emotional issues, I may not have thought the book was so funny...just as blondes don't think blonde jokes are humorous. But from my perspective, I loved it."
2,Not worth the price,"This was the first article I purchased online. Save yourself the money. Go to the public library and look it up or request an inter-library loan. In regard to this particular article, it offers no original insight, if you already own the Namie book on bullying. Just recycled content."
3,Worked for a while,"I got this lamp used from a friend of a friend, and i used it for maybe three months before one day the dimmer stopped working and it blew out my 16 dollar bulb. however, like i said, i got it used, and i put it to work with a rheostat once i got it. its a good lamp. i don't trust dimmers now but it's a great lamp. with a 150 W bulb, placed a foot or so above my tank, the lamp was able to heat the tank over 95 degrees using a 150w ceramic fixture. it's a powerful lamp. herp a derp. im buying a lamp from the same brand but without the dimmer since i never used the dimmer."
2,"Right packaging, wrong product",Ordered a dimmable fixture. Received an on/off fixture in dimmable packaging.Return was smooth but still a hassle and I need to look elsewhere.
3,Just OK,"The wheel to turn the heat on and up is very easy to move. If it is messed with at all, it will dramatically change the heat. It serves it's purpose but would not recommend in houses with small children younger than 10."
5,Prefect for the job!,I use this to hang in the middle of my chick brooder to make 3 zones of heat so the little chicks don't get too hot under the 250watt heat lamp. I purchased the ceramic 150watt heat emitter to go with it plus the stand. My chicks love it & so do I....
1,Poor quality control,"Never could get this to work properly, right out of the box. I was using a heating bulb in it, and it just wouldn't make a good contact when screwed all the way in the recepticle. I would have to wiggle it to get it to flicker on, and as soon as I set it down, it would go off. Very frustrating. Was the same for every bulb I tried in it. Sent it back for a refund."
1,"Well, Next Album Please","Burton Cummings has a terrific voice but the material on this album is NOT terrific, after listening to this effort one word came to mind NEXT, none of these songs on the LP are worth remembering. Buton does much better on his next LP, ""A Dream of a Child"" and this is the album that explores Buton's talent as a solo artist quite well. However the ""My Own Way to Rock"" album should find its way back to the Vault or buried in a hole in the ground."
2,Boring! Anoying! Wish i would not have bought it!,"I really like Lisa's 1st DVD! This one however is not good at all. As others have said she is not even really in a studio. She is Computer imposed there, and it is so annoying to watch it because it is so obvious! The moves are very boring. When Lisa talks she is always looking to the left a little. There is something so off about doing these exercises. I just could not get over her not being seen in the mirror behind her ??? I will stick with her first one, but don't wast your money on this one."
1,She isn't even at the studio!!! Superimposed and it is creepy!!,"This DVD is a joke!! Her techniques are OK, but there are more shots of her ""Bombshells"" than necessary. Did not feel she was sincere at all, maybe because she wasn't even in the studio LOL. Terrible filming.She has ZERO personalty to go with her techniques. What is which the rocking back and forth on the swing????? NEVER have seen that before. I am certified and have been training with KB's for 7 years.Kettlebells are the best out there but this DVD is NOT!!"
2,Don't need all the rest periods,"The exercises are fine and well-demonstrated, but as so many others have noted, the ridiculous rest breaks with terrible graphics and annoying, ominous music is a big waste. I prefer a workout that flows. Having to stop and fast forward through these really bogs down the experience. Consequently, I just don't bother with this workout. I'd rather do Bob Harper's DVDs if I have the time or Jillian Michaels' half-hour shreds if I'm pressed for time. Very disappointing, poorly designed and over-priced."
5,Excellent!,"This is an amazing, kick butt Kettlebell workout. I've read reviews from people complaining about the breaks. If you don't need the breaks in this workout then you need to use a heavier bell...because if done right these workouts will kick your butt! I promise!Challenge your body, workout with this DVD. You will be amazed at the results!"
1,Toy default,I purchased this item in July and put it up for my sons birthday. I gave him the guitar a few weeks ago and last night the toy broke with nobody playing with it. The screws and glue that held the strings down popped off.
2,disappointing,"The guitar looks pretty, but does not perform well. We were unable to tune it and keep it tuned. The strings were too far off the frett board making it difficult for a child to play. We returned it and bought a travel guitar from our local music store."
4,Great Christmas gift for little boy,"I was just a bit dissapointed by some of the scratches/sticker work on the body of the guitar, but for the money it is to be a bit expected. This guitar toes that line between toy and musical instrument, leaning a bit more toward toy. It is a bit difficult to keep in tune and even when it's tuned correct some of the chords just don't sound right. In all happy with the purchase and I have an extremely happy 5yr old boy who can now sit and play with dad."
4,"Schoenhut 30"" acoustic guitar (pink)","this guitar came with a pic, a case, and extra string. This mid size guitar is very nice for my 6 year old granddaughter and she loves the pink color. She was warned not to tighten the strings without help. She was also reminded to put it up around any younger kids. This guitar requires proper care to last along time and teaches kids how to take care of a guitar before investing in a real one. Amazon delivered it on time and in good condition."
2,You get what you pay for.,"My six year old has been begging for a guitar. Not wanting to pay much for his first, in case he looses interest right away, my wife and I thought this would be suitable. It appeared to be pretty good considering the price. I tuned it right on the money using an electronic tuner, but when I played a chord, it sounded way out of tune. Double checking with the tuner showed the strings were in tune when playing open, but when way out when using the frets. The frets must not be positioned correctly. To play a G on the small E string, it has to be pushed all the way up to the B string for it to go in tune.Can't complain much. Got what I paid for. A toy."
4,Nice but....,"This was a gift for my three year old on her birthday. Someone bought another, slightly less expensive, guitar for her that I returned and replaced with this. This was $15 more and much more well made. Very sturdy. My 3 year old can play this and I can see it still ""fitting"" her for another 4-5 yearsMy only complaint is that the strings seems to loosen fairly easy. This can be fixed easily by adjusting the knobs up top so it is not a huge deal.The body of the guitar is plastic, not wood as I initially thought. Not a big deal, just thought I should mention"
3,"Good looking, better than other children's guitars","I purchased this so that my 3 year old wouldn't destroy my good guitar. For this purpose, it has worked out perfectly. It doesnt hold a tune very well, but perhaps this could be fixed with new strings. Don't get me wrong, it sounds better than most guitars in its class/price range, but it is definitely not a musical instrument. More made for fun/horsing around. If I had it to do over, I probably would just purchase one of those paper guitars that plays music - for the age my kids are they seem to enjoy it better."
1,Dissapointed,"My 6 yr old wanted a guitar for Christmas. Since he shows some interest in learning music I thought this would be a good purchase. The description labels the guitar as a student guitar, but it should be listed as a toy. Needless to say I am sorely disappointed. Other reviews make this ""guitar"" out to be a quality purchase, I must have gotten a reject. My 2yr old has fun with it.Pro:CheapCon:Cheap, Poor construction (knots in wood, fretboard/neck separation, high frets, sharp edges on the neck), doesn't hold tune, high e string buzzes due to poorly mounted bridge."
2,"Fun toy, not a great musical instrument","This guitar arrived packaged well, but when we opened it looked like it had been repaired. The neck had some obvious abrasions that had been repainted, so we wondered if it was a used guitar. It was impossible to tune the guitar where basic chords could be played. Despite all of that, the seven year old still seemed to enjoy the gift. For the price it was an ok toy, but I wouldn't expect it to be used for beginner music lessons."
3,Tuning issue,"It appears the tuning key on the B string doesn't function properly. So it is hard to get in tune. Too close to Christmas to return, and I want to give it to my Grandaughter. I will see how it does Christmas morning."
1,Horrible Craftsmanship,"We received our first of two Schoenhut guitars and saw that it was very dinged up and paint was scratched in places. We sent it back to the Amazon reseller, and ordered a replacement guitar from Amazon. The second one came worse than the first one.The guitar itself probably sounds ok, but we sent both back because of horrible craftsmanship. No ""new"" product should ever ship in such horrible condition."
4,Great beginner guitar,My 7 year old girl loved it!! Its a great starter guitar. Good size for a little girl. I showed it to her piano (and now guitar) teacher and she said she can take a beginner lessons with it. The only problem is that it needs to be tuned every time after she uses it.
3,"Cute, but CHEAP","My daughter received this for Christmas and as soon as she opened it we realized it was damaged. The fret board was not attached to the guitar. My husband got some epoxy and clamps and fixed it because our daughter was so upset. She then went to put the guitar away in the bag and the bag had a tear the entire way up the seam. The strap that comes with it is so cheap the straps to hook it onto the guitar immediately pulled apart. I called the company and they sent a new bag and strap and the hooks on the strap already broke after one use. It is a cute guitar, but very cheaply made. Invest in something a little more costly if you don't feel like making immediate repairs!"
1,Piece of Junk,This is one of the worst items I have purchased online. This children's guitar was entirely made of plastic and of the most shoddy construction. When it arrived the fretboard had become unglued and was laying loose in the box. I re-glued the fretboard and then began to attempt to tune the guitar. While tuning the very first string (low E) the bridge tore loose from the body. I immediately boxed it and sent it back. I later purchased a nice rosewood beginner guitar for about $2 more than I paid for this item which due to the quality should have been priced at $10 instead of the $50 listed.
4,Child Guitar - Schoenhut,"We purchased this child guitar for our [....] son. He loves it. Some children's guitars in this price range are more of a toy, but to our surprise it tunes up well and has real metal/steel strings. He is currently using it for private guitar lessons and the teacher approved it as very suitable choice."
1,cheaply made,"The best thing was the paint job. Cheaply made, horribly constructed. Jagged wood around heart-shaped hole under strings and the entire bridge came off with just a little light playing. ""Mark well the name"" is the slogan for this company...I will and and avoid it!"
5,Girls Guitar,Got this for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas as she had expressed interest in wanting a guitar. She loves it! She does not have any formal training and does not take lessons but she loves to put on shows with the guitar and strum on it. It seems to be good quality for the price and very cute.
1,"Good retailer - poor item (rough/sharp edges, will not tune,...)","18 Nov 2011I bought this guitar based on it's good reviews about being able to stay in tune. The unit I received will not tune - the gears turn far too easily to allow it to be played. If you strum it once without holding a gear - then that string goes out of tune.The body of the guitar does not have a decent layer of shellac. The edges are not only rough - several are sharp along the body. There are places along the body and stem which have no shellac, and the face has what look like mold spots under the shellac.Her $15 Walmart guitar that this was to replace is of much better quality of construction and sound.I wouldn't even use this guitar as a wall decoration - it is that bad..."
4,Good starter guitar,"This guitar was purchased for my 5 y.o daughter who is interested in learning to play guitar. It is a good quality instrument. The wood is lovely and the other parts seem to be sturdy. My husband broke a string tuning it, but it was easily replaced. The sound is good. The guitar is not a toy as it would break with any serious roughhousing. I do recommend it as a beginner's instrument."
3,Its Okay,"We have had this guitar for a year or so now and its falling apart. You get what you pay for, and its done its job (getting the children interested in music). Just don't expect a lot and don't expect it to last."
3,not happy,I ordered this two weeks before my daughters birthday. It arrived the day after. So I didn't have a gift for her at her party. Also nowhere in the description does it say its plastic. Extremely disappointed.
3,Okay quality,Seems like a nice guitar..for the $ paid a little nice manufacture would be great: ie i can see all the glue lines where it was put together...
2,Doesn't hold a tune!,"Purchased this based on the other reviews for my 3 year old son. Unfortunately, the guitar will hardly stay in tune and the build quality is rather shoddy. My son loves to hammer on it and plays with it all the time. It will work for now until tuning becomes more important..."
3,Great price hard to tune,"Got this for my 2 year daughter since she loves to play with her dads. She has enjoyed and does not care about the sound. I have to tune everytime, some folks say that the longer we have it the less it happen so we will see. If noting else it makes her happy."
2,Tuning Issue,"I was very excited about getting a real guitar for my 18 month old that loves to watch her Dad play his guitar. Unfortunately, my husband, a long-time musician was not able to tune this guitar. He said it could be just the one we received, but that there was a design flaw that did not allow it to keep a tune."
1,disappointed in workmanship...,"My mistake--I didn't open this until christams morning, when my child finally got it as a gift. It is not red, and the paint and construction is terrible. It sounds ok, but I fear about it's durabilitly. We bought a Valencia guitar back in august for his birthday for $10 less and it is 100 times the product that this one is. My child has already fallen in love, so unfortunately I am not able to send it back--at least until it breaks..."
4,Good Summer Read,"I always enjoy Jane Heller's books and this one didn't disappoint.The only problem I had with it was the dual point of views. So much more time was given to Amy that you expected Tara's short parts to really give insight into the character that would make you realize she's different from how Amy is portraying her. However, not only did that not happen, but Tara's passages made her even more unlikeable to me, so I'm not really sure what the point of them was.Definitely worth adding to your summer reading list."
5,A great read,"This is my first Jane Heller book and I enjoyed it very much. The old saying ""Oh what a tangled web we weave"" really holds true with this story. I also enjoyed the way the book tells the story from two different points of view. Sometimes things are not as they seem when looked at thru different eyes."
4,"Well written, fun book!","There are about a million chick lit books just like this out there, where Girl #2 steals her best friend Girl #1's man, but I particularly liked Heller's version. Her character Amy is compelling and sympathetic, and the switching of point of view was a fun twist. It's a great revenge story for anyone who's ever been dumped, but it doesn't come off as bitter. There's even a bit of a mystery at the end.If you want an entertaining, fun book, you can't go wrong with Best Enemies."
4,"Another light, fun read","I like Jane Heller's conversational way of writing and yes, the plots tend to be seethrough, but when you just want a light LOL read, this is it!Others I like: Whitney Gaskell, Beth Kendrick, Alesia Holliday, Janet Evanovich & Emily Giffin"
5,EXCELENTE,"Excelente vendedor, entrega rápida, el pantalón es de muy buena calidad, estilo clásico, que para estos días es difícil encontrar, ideal para el trabajo diario."
4,nice jeans,my husband wears Dickies brand jeans to work and has found them to be quite rugged compared to other jeans. These were very nice because they weren't too stiff .
4,pants,"The pants have no flaws the seams are good they fit me. No problems, they came in a strangely over sized box though. That was weird."
1,True War Movie Fans Stay Away,"If you are a Rutger Hauer fan then ok but bewarned that he only is in about 5-7 minutes of this 91 minute movie, his apearances are broken up into 30-45 second clips.His acting hardly shines in this flick and the rest of the actors are for the most part in this a no show.All in all the movie blows chunks, if you are any kind of war movie fan that expects some combat realism and correct combat terminology to be used by the actors then forget this one.Example - Throughout the movie the marines constantly referred to the rebels as ""bogies"", that and other mess ups throughout the movie makes it sad and laughable.There is no true target adience for this film, too much blood and violence IMO for the kids and the acting is way too poor to really be enjoyed by an adult.Perhaps a few teenagers will overlook this films many negatives.Need I say more??"
1,Just when I thought I had seen the worst movie ever...,"Another failure for ""Nanofilms""! I wish I had their address so that I could send them the $7.00 that it cost to make this movie. If someone could please have Rutger give me a call so that I can make sure he has enough money to eat. This movie was so poorly directed, I would be surprised if that director still has a job. For those who gave it a great review, I will give you a number for your nearest military recruiter. This movie showed an utter lack of respect for this country's military and especially the USMC. If you enjoy watching movies, save yourself the time and money and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE."
1,Cheap PORN movie with out the SEX.,I saw the first 10 min...and then realized what a crapy made cheaply directed and I dont know why it was even on the shelf at my local store.
3,Marine son's big part,"Had to have this movie. Our Marine son was stationed in the Philippines as the Detachment Commander when a Hollywood producer asked if he'd like to be in a movie. He's the guy with the dimple who shouts out a couple of lines in the helicopter before it went down. Pretty bad movie, but we always watch the first five minutes."
3,B+ Movie,As with most modern B movies they are quite watchable if you have the right B movie kind of company..iE lotsa not too smart friends who just want to see and hear gun fire.Recommended for the not too smart OR HIGH TECH inclined movie buffs ...for those who have a bit of intellect I ask you to stay away.....the stars are Big name B+ movie stars so that in itself is a good thing if you are so inclined.
5,Powerful but not overwhelming,An excellent book for both beginners and power-users alike. Powerful concepts explained concisely in plain English. Discusses and explains real-world uses for industry standard design procedures.I've recommended this book to everyone I know that needs to come up to speed with database theory and usage.
4,Simplified & easy to understand,The book is very helpful for novice learners of databases. It provides step-by-step guide to those who are new in database design and Microsoft Access. Key concepts like normalization are presented very clearly with relevant examples in business.
4,"it's great, don't buy it here","It's a great album, the artwork is awesome, it's just not worth $18. Go to a CD store and buy it there, I think I paid 8 buck for it. The title track is absolutely awesome, and behind those I would put Richard Devine A+ Student and then wenerpeg mannertoeba"
1,useless,"I was ordering the intermediate algebra textbook and Amazon recommeded this one. The textbook is the 10th edition, and the recommended solutions manual is for the 8th edition. Amazon must be trying to get rid of their worthless books."
2,Not enough,This video is very short and doesn't have a lot of content. Thier are some great sceens but overall its nothing you havn't seen before. I would have liked to see some avalanches and better explanations of all natural disasters with more depth.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this video because my son is OBSESSED with volcanoes. I hoped to see more footage of eruptions, but instead, the video focuses on ash eruptions and discussions with vulcanologists. It is interesting, but I'm sure there is better footage out there."
4,My nephew loved it! :),"I bought this DVD because my nephew loves Tornadoes. It does not disappoint and gives amazing footage on natural disasters. It is a little short, but the documentary is worth the watching. It catches your attention and leaves you wanting more."
4,Forces of Nature,Real good video and long-lasting. One thing we didn't like was the camera making far too many quick shots on a regular basis so as no to be able to see a lot of things. Doesn't make sense to film them and then show them so quickly you can't possibly watch them.
2,"Bad product description, Good tool","I have had many set of punches. This one is a good set for a mechanic. Being a gunsmith for the US Army, I work with weapons every day. This is not a set for gunsmiths. For that you need #1-#6 but I guess that isn't an available set. So it looks like I spend a bit extra and order them individually, or get a $175.00 set with a bunch of stuff I don't need.Sizes#4 or 1/8""#5 or 5/32""#6 or 3/16""#7 or 7/32""#8 or 1/4""#9 or 5/16"""
5,GREAT SOUND,"The great sound of a ""TRADICIONAL TUMBADORA"" Perfect wide size of the head.Don't have to kill yourself while playing to get the sound you are looking for.I enjoy getting the DEEP BASS sound out of it, really great for Afro Style Rhythm."
4,This will appeal to fan of Tanith Lee...,"...but may not be as interesting to others. It suffers from the tangential aspect to story-telling she often takes which may be distracting to some, but will be fulfilling to long-time fans. The story is as rich and detailed as we've come to expect and, in my opinion, doesn't end up long winded. Rather, it's complex and layered.If you're new to Tanith Lee you might be better served to start with one of her shorter books, however, because this one is a doozy."
4,Lots of project and ideas,This French beaded flower book is full of projects and ideas unlike books from other authors. Patterns are creative and instructions are very clear.
1,Poorly photographed,"I found the book to be a great disappointment. The photo illustrations of the various dishes were drab and poorly photographed and did not make the dishes look appetizing at all. One wonders how the photographs got past the author who had obviously done a lot of research on the cuisine of Macau and is very knowledgeable. Macau cuisine in its own right is unique and when cooked correctly, an absolute delight. As for the recipes, they were pretty much spot on. Being the son of parents who were raised in Macao and of Portuguese ancestry and having a mother who was an excellent Macanese cook I should know. For an excellent alternative to this book try ""Macanese Cooking - a journey across generations"" by Cecilia Jorge. Now there's a well written and well illustrated Macanese cookbook."
3,Okay,"Cute, but not really that comfortable. Fits true to size. These shoes are probably more for beach days rather than walking."
3,HHH,The Orton figure is horrible! The Triple H Figure is awsome though! With the Belt that deffinatly Belongs to him and the Accurate facial expression THE GAME HHH figure is deffinatly woth 5 stars. The Orton Figure is bad so if you buy it just throw it away and put the HHH on the mantel under a Glass box!
2,"Poor Voice Quality, Confusing Operation","I found a number of reviews online that said this machine was okay except for voice quality, so when I saw the box that touted excellent voice quality, I figured that the product had been improved in that regard. Not true. My recording sounds poor. Also, althought there are seven buttoms on the machine, their use isn't clear. I found it confusing to setup, you have to cycle through all the setup options and push three buttons to change each. I'll be returning this."
1,I laughed when I read this book,"My main objection to this book is that it is full of lies. The sudbury philosophy sounds great, but having enrolled in one, I have discovered that the dream of children having freedom in the educational system remains far from becoming a reality."
3,Hmmm ...,"For some reason, I never really got into this book.It's quite well written ... even amusing at times ... the solutions offered for common problems faced by dog owners are generally quite practical and sensible ... Perhaps, I never really got into this book because the book doesn't offer anything original, or maybe because the author keeps plugging his other books every chance he gets ...Hmmm ... probably the latter ...Otherwise ... it's a reasonably good buy ... and deals with most common problems faced by dog owners. This book might would have got three and a half stars, but Amazon doesn't have that ... so ..."
3,Excellent latin guitar duo-they can ACTUALLY play flamenco!,"Being a flamenco guitarist myself, I am often dissapointed with guitar duos that play ""latin guitar"", but claim it to be flamenco, which is a very precise and profound music by itself. These guys however, have made an excellent CD in the vien of Strunz and Farah. Perhaps too many rumbas that sound similar for my taste, but prove that they know and play real flamenco with thier own style. Sure if you like Ottmar Liebert or Young&Rollins, you'll like this too, but if you're a fan of real flamenco guitar, you might be pleasantly surprized. Tremendous playing ability, real knowledge of flamenco, and a great sounding product is why I like the album."
1,No insight into anything whatsoever.,"This book in one word- boring. You would think that because this woman was Karl Barth's little concubine that she would at least be able to put a coherent thought together because perhaps, by osmosis, she would have absorbed some of his ability to write about theological philosophy. Not so. It is all very stream of conscious. Booo."
5,Texe Marrs expose,We very much appreciate Texe Marrs and all the things he reveals. Others will not touch many of the subjects that Mr. Marrs investigates. With gratitude we count ourselves his friends and supporters.
5,Great fun - I am back to buy more,"My 7 year old daughter got this for Christmas and it has been a non-stop hit ever since we plugged it in. Kids and adults alike enjoy the game - its easy to play and really almost feels like you are mini-golfing. There are a bunch of different crazy courses to play, and my daughter and her friends will play with this thing for hours, going through each course. She has one little friend who comes over to our house, looking for the mini golf game as he walks through the door. I am back shopping for one to give him for his birthday - and I might buy an extra as a back up gift as they are such fun! Highly recommended toy that has withstood many hours of enthusiastic play."
1,So disappointed.,i bought this several months ago. I had one of these games before for my grandson and he played with it constantly. He moved away and took the game. I bought a new one for other grandchildren because they are old enough to play with it. We played with it once. It wasn't hit or played with roughly. Took it out today to play again and it simply will not work. I changed the batteries and tried it on two different TV's. I'm going to try getting and electric plug and see if that will work but I don't have high hopes.
5,Wild Adventure Mini Golf,"Great product. Lots of fun for whole family, young and old. Has wonderfulgraphics and several different golf courses. Best mini golf games ever played even in real life. 4 players can play a game together which really makes it even more fun to play. We love to play it with our grandchildren."
4,"Burton Cummings, right after leaving the Guess Who, showing that he is great in his own right.","Burton's vocals and piano playing are first rate. The whole album is great listening, not just the hit, Stand Tall."
4,More of that Guess Who Sound,"""Stand Tall"" is definitely my favorite track from this CD, but ""I'm Scared"" is another good tune."
5,Great Book For Crystal Reports Training,"My boss gave me the opportunity to spend a few days to go through this book page by page to learn to create reports in Crystal Reports. After a week, I was able to put together complex reports that helped our department show what we were able to acomplish. I returned again and again to this book to help make better reports. I recommend this book not only to learn, but to continue to write excellent reports."
4,Good book,I received this book 2 weeks ago and I am still studying each chapter every night....This is a great book for beginners like me and I think the exercises are very well written and easy to follow...I am working on exercise 18 and to tell the true I feel very comfortable now.......
4,What a great concept!,"What a perfect way to learn and see great travel footage while working out! I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these, but I was pleasently surprised. Basically it's just really nice footage of scenic driving and biking routes set to music. I have a television right in front of my exercise bike, and I even watch it from the tread mill. Keep 'em coming!"
1,Ride is too short for use in Cycling,"I enjoyed the other Bike-O-Vision projects very much but this presentation is so short, under twenty minutes. It was not very appropriate for indoor cycling training."
3,indifferent,"The site seeing is nice but it's pretty slow, and the music selection doesn't exactly motivate you."
4,Ivitiation to Europe,"This video was well done - a nice sample of several countries and roads. The scenery was beautiful and the music chosen well - although I might have added a bit of yodelling to the alps, and a Tarentella to Italy. I have already made room in my daypack for a baquette, cheese and some wine!!"
3,"Excellent Sampler, but...","This was an excellent sampler of the European videos available from Bike-O-Vision, but I feel a little ripped off.It's only 30 minutes or so long. It really should have been much longer."
4,I liked it!,I like using this when I train on indoors on my bike. It breaks up the same old news or Ipod music.
1,Who cycles to classical music?,"I've cycled throughout Europe and bought this DVD to bring back memories of all the beautiful villages I've been through. Although the scenery is good, it's a very bad choice of music! I don't think I can watch this again unless I'm reading a book or cleaning while it is playing!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This DVD looks like 35 minutes (is that all???) of stock footage of European countryside set to generic classical music. I bought this expecting a pseudo visual riding experience while I worked out on my indoor trainer. I expected some climbs, some flats, some downhills and a true road experience. You drive(ride) along roads for several segments. This is all well and good but for the last 10 minutes, you just get scenes of the various sights in various parts of different European cities (Frieburg, Strasbourg,etc). The fact that is was so short and really didn't contain much ""meat"" was very disappointing. I feel like I wasted my money."
1,Cheap hedge Trimmer,I bought the Troybilt hedge trimmer for $159.00 (good price)The very first time I went to use it it broke. The blades tied up and would not move at all. Then I tried to get warranty work and it was another hassle because I did not have a sale receipt because I bought it over the internet. I am still waiting to get it fixed!!!
1,Avoid the Troy-Bilt TB25GHT Gas Hedge Trimmer,I'll make this very brief. The flimsy recoil starter cord snapped after 25 or so pulls as I attempted to start this trimmer for the first time. I returned it and bought an Echo HC-150.
3,Troy-Bilt Gas Hedge Trimmer,"Initially, this unit appeared to be very easy to start and cut through shrubbery very well. After about 45 minutes, the cutting ability seemed diminished for unknown reasons. I allowed the unit to cool down, then tried to start it one last time to see if this corrected the problem. The starting cord broke on the second pull. The warranty information indicates that wear items such as the pull cord are not covered. I plan to contact Toro today to see if that applies to first-day usage! After getting my cord repaired, I was told that the unit needed to be sharpened and that was the cause of poor cutting action. I paid to do that only to find out that this is a very poor unit and will not even cut the smallest branches. I contacted Troy-Bilt and they more or less told me that poor function was not included in their warranty. I would strongly suggest another unit if at all possible. I will never purchase another Troy-Bilt product!!!"
2,poor quality,"As far as money goes, I recieved a great deal on the gas hedger paying only $ 146 for the unit. However, when I fired it up I immediately found that the throdle cable was mis-adjusted as it would hardly rev above an idle. After fixing that, I went to work. Though the comments say it can cut through a 3/4"" branch, after 10 minutes of use and as I was cutting bushes half that big, the blade bent around a branch and doug into the steel. This left a burr in the steel blade big enough that I could not continue until I manually filed the burr off. The blade is obviously made of very soft metal. I'm not impressed and may still try to get my money back."
1,Troy Bilt Hedge Trimmer #TB25GHT Review.,"I bought a Troy Bilt TB25GHT hedge trimmer on the internet and it broke on the first twig I cut (about 1/4""). Broke a gear. Tried to get warranty service. Model discontinued. Parts no longer available."
1,worst of breed,"I bought this because of brand recognition and am extremely dissapointed. I had been using a older unit (B&D or homelite) and received quite some use until it finally failed. now after moving to a larger yard with a number of hedges I am frequently in need to maintain these areas. unfortunetly this unit has been in the shop twice, exchanged once and is failing again. Mind you, I only purchased the original unit about 5 months ago and have probably used the unit(s) about 6/7 times. When you consider the $140 price you assume that the unit will last at least one full season."
5,The Brothers Brought the Funk&Nothing but the funk,"this is a happening Collection right here. collections like this is the reason why Schools have to save the Music because this is a Slamming Collection of Jams. Funky Drum breaks,Bass&Horns that are slamming. so many styles are covered here,but the Funk is front&Center. the Funk is timeless&never gets old. even 30 plus years later this Collection is still rocking a House party. Props to these brothers for bringing the Funk."
5,Awesome CD!!!,"This is the best CD I have bought in a long time. If you love funky 70's tunes, especially if they sound like something from a Starsky and Hutch car chase scene, then this is the CD for you. These kids had talent!"
2,All show- little substance,"All-show and little substance was general opinion in Houston during that time period. They would put on a great show with the jivey dancing but the music was not up to par. Fun to watch and exciting BUT their hype was greater than the musical talent. But Conrad Johnson (RIP) was and still is a musical legend in Houston. He was a true gentleman. I had the honor and privilege to play in his rehearsal band for a brief time. He help so many in the Houston African-Amercan community during some challenging times that one must honor him for all that he achieved and all those he guided to success. As with the band comments above, the social commentary and historical reflections expressed in this dvd deserve 4 stars--but not the music."
5,Not a toy but a Card,"Not bad for a card. I like how they recreate the old look to the card. I recommend people that are collectors or have any interest in Babe Ruth, to go find ya a card just as good as this one I received."
5,A beautiful read,"Once again Amanda McCabe shows her deft way with words building a lovely romance going from Italy to the English countryside. Full of rich, sensory descriptions, LADY MIDNIGHT tells the story of two people getting a second chance at happiness. McCabe has a way of creating heroes and heroines with pure hearts and spirits. This book has the bonus of a hoyden younger sister and a mysterious jilted lover whose story needs to be told.A wonderful historical novel to transport the reader to another time and place."
1,Not a technical recruiting book,"This book has a wrong name. The correct name would be ""Basics of recruiting"" with focus on how to detect deceit in resumes or during an interview. The book has nothing to do with technical recruiting, absolutely nothing.Moreover, the book is so basic and simple that even I, with very little experience in recruiting, found no useful info whatsoever. Don't waste your money."
1,Breakthrough Technical Recruiting,"This book is mistitled! If you're looking for another book on general recruiting this will do. Aside from an opening page, it lacks content specific to technical recruiting. From the title and description, one would expect more tips and pointers to help in identifying and communicating in this specialized field. Mr. Ford fails to discuss such things as basic technology concepts, critical to success in this area. The information and principles are very general in nature. With over 10 year's recruiting experience, while I recognize that many of the basics are the same, there are numerous areas that differ when dealing with technologist and that can contribute to success or failure."
5,Our New Tech Recruiting Bible!,This complete manual of how to recruit technical professionals is so well used we just ordered 3 more copies for our office. All the areas we feel are important are presented in great detail and in a way that can be both a learning course and as a reference. This is a true masterpiece of instruction in the fine art of tech recruiting. It is worth a ton for new and seasoned recruiters. We like it and we recommmend it.
1,Basic but a waste,The information in this book was only mildly helpful in that it is a mere sketch of recruitment practices. The author skims the surface of many topics but lacks depth. It seems like he was under the gun to meet a deadline and is overcharging people for what appears to be an outline of a much more substantial book.
1,NO BREAKTHROUGH HERE,"This rating is coming from someone who has been working in the contingency and retained technical recruiting industry for the past 10 years. I forced myself through the book (cover to cover) in a little more than one hour. I understand why experienced recruiters who were expecting an innovative exposition, were annoyed and dissatisfied. They are justified. Certain raters of this book have misrepresented its quality and the intellect of the material within. Moreover, I am surprised that no one has called the numerous spelling and grammatical errors into question. If you want a superficial, one-dimensional outline of the technical recruiting industry, then this book may satisfy you. If you are already a competent recruiter, don't expect a breakthrough here. This book was not written through the mind and heart of a real-world, front-line, technical recruiter."
1,Not Worth the Price of Admission,"This low-quality three-ring binder is filled with off-the-shelf, trite advice which has very little to do with technical recruiting. All of this information has been presented better by other authors at a much more reasonable price. Certainly not ""breakthrough"" quality. I'm shipping my copy back for a refund. Your money would be better spent buying ""Technical Recruiting"" by M. Susan Hodges and ""Take This Job and Sell It!"" by Richard Mackie."
2,Recruiting 101 with some decent resume boards thrown in,"Save your money. This is filled with such basic recruiting info that it almost insults the readers intelligence. I was hoping to get a comprehensive guide to help me in my new career. Fifty dollars later, all I had in my hands was something that I might have justified paying $10 for, if that.The only worth while thing in the book is the resource page of niche oriented resume/job boards. If it wasn't for that I'd give it one star."
3,Light keeps turning itself on when in my pocket. and it's too thick,"The light (which isn't very bright) uses a push-on, push-off button (you don't have to hold it to stay on), and it would constantly turn itself on when in my pocket, running the battery down. If you don't keep it in a pocket, it should not be a big problem. It is also too thick. The compass works fine, and I ended up removing it from the housing and using it by itself, without the light."
1,Useless,"The compass is wholly unreliable. The light button turns on in your bag, thus draining the battery. One of my worst Amazon purchases."
5,INDISPENSABLE!,"This should be required reading for any person considering a field in the real estate industry. With an almost irreverant style, Wayne and Lynn Morgan explain clearly and simply how to have the best of both worlds - time and money. It doesn't matter whether you are a newly licensed realtor or a broker with 25 years of experience, the material in this book is sure to make a difference in your real estate business. The best part about it is that the book is actually fun to read!"
1,Pie in the Sky Real Estate Guru Nonsense,"Any body who really believes this title and hype, needs to wake up and smell the coffee of real estate business reality. It is the typical fare of the self-appointed guru who got out of real estate because he found he was a better entertainer than a Realtor. He and his wife, create get rich quick and easy seminars from Austin, TX to Australia. I attended one myself as well as read this book which was distributed for FREE. And that is what it is worth in my opinion."
2,Hard To Get Through,I tried really hard to get through this book since it was recommended by another person on Amazon. I found that much of the conversation was spent with the author playing devil's advocate to everything the person was being interviewed saying. I also thought the author trying to define what love was by badgering them with questions which was boring. I would have like them to talk about their experiences with love without the questioning from the author.
2,Target Audience Not Clear: Do Beginners Have These Resources?,"I'm not sure for whom this book was written. Assuming you have the vast, union-style resources outlined within, it's safe to say you're also somewhat knowledgeable about how to use them. For the budding independent filmmaker courageous enough to serve as both director and set decorator, perhaps even transportation supervisor, this is an utterly useless text. It's from an old school of movie making which insists upon a single method of function. It's a primer on how to waste money, aimed at people who don't have a lot of it. If you want to make a movie the first step is watch as many as you can. Devour director commentaries, and experiment on your own. If however you're a bored billionaire looking to get into producing, then this might just be what you're looking for."
1,The pathetic rant of a Scientologist nut,"From crazed accusations that psychiatry created Hitler to hysterical allegations that psychiatry is responsible for pretty much all crime, war, drug abuse, the cancellation of Star Trek, etc., this twisted, stream-of-consciousness rant is the most perfect example there is of the true delusional madness of L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology cult, of which author Bruce Wiseman is a fanatical member.So I'd give it five stars for humor value, but for factual value, I regret only there is no choice to rate with negative numbers."
5,Excellant and oh so affordable,"Much better pricing than you can get in any store. Very good product and will order more. CVS sells these but they are twice the cost, buy this and SAVE!"
5,Must Have Book,"Could not wait to get into this book .If this book does not blow your hair back, nothing will.Info in this book will tell you everything you wanted to know and more .You cannot top this book .If you haven't got it , get it !"
2,OK,I like one song on the CD. I usually can't buy CD's because I get really tired of the songs after a few times.
3,The Blessing by John Waller,"The song I like the best on this album is, While I'm Waiting...one of the songs used in the Fireproof movie."
2,Not quite what I expected,"Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations of this album, but I would probably return it if I had the ability to do so. I should mention some of the other music I'm into at the moment though, to give you an idea of what I'm comparing this album to: Rush of Fools, Jackson Waters, Relient K, Mainstay, 33Miles, Need to Breathe, SevenGlory, Nevertheless, December Radio.A few of the tracks are keepers, but they're not the type of tracks that send me to the record store to pickup the entire album - I'd rather have bought these tracks online by themselves."
1,book needs a rewrite,"Fragmented in approach. Data missing, could not download as instructed from English site. Needs a severe re-write.Not worth the paper it's printed on.Over rated - minus 5 on scale of 1-10 (high)."
3,Getting Things Done,"I really found this book helpful in changing my life style, and taking the things in different and with professional approach.It really help us to consider a lot of things which are really fruitful for success in every field of life but we don't consider them usually.I would like to say thanks to Mr Roger Black."
2,Can't find what I need,"I bought this book because I've been very pleased with other ""Unleashed"" titles.However, I have to agree with the other reviewers here. The index is lousy and I haven't yet been able to find what I need. I've been trying to find out how to use the ""Filter by Form"" toolbar button and I haven't found it either in the Index or table of contents.Next time I'll read the Amazon reviews first (like I usually do)!"
1,Don't buy this book!!,"Very poorly organized...just like some high school kids putting together a report. If you are a beginner, don't ever buy this book! Although it claims to make one a master of Access."
2,The book contains many words but says very little.,The book is written and reads more like a novel than a technical how-to guide and reference. The material is very basic and does an incomplete job introducing these basic concepts. I have found it to be very weak as a learning tool or reference tool.
2,Not very pleased,"The book does a good job covering the basics, but when you are looking for how to do this or that the book falls very flat. The book does a good job at defining terminology, but it will not be very useful for a developer"
1,As useless a book as I've ever seen.,This book presents almost no useful information. I got taken. Should have read the other reviews before I bought.
2,Great Songs...Not Re-mastered?,"This a great collection of music, but the claims that most of the tracks were remastered appears to be a lie. In fact, I would say these tracks were remastered no later than the late-eighties. And thus this was obviously a no production value collection, created just to line the pockets of EMI, and Mr. Bowie.So, if you own the ChangesBowie collection from 1989 or so, don't bother with this one."
4,David Bowie must be in every home,"I have always been a fan of David Bowie but this was the first CD with him that I bought. It is necessary to have this for a fan but I have to critisice that ""Absolute Beginners"" is not on the CD."
2,Don't buy this album!!,"Unless you like shortened/cutup versions of Bowie's songs, don't buy this CD! Don't know who the moron was who thought cutting up classic Bowie songs was a smart idea but they should be fired!! Again, don't buy this album!!!"
4,Starman?,"It is a very good album, but unfortunately Starman song is not part of this -almost- excellent compilation. I'm looking for an album with both Starman and Thursday's Child songs"
3,It Works For Me,"I happened across this disc while looking for something else. I'm not a huge Bowie fan, but this disc contains songs of his that I'm most familiar with - Ashes To Ashes, Fame, Fashion, Blue Jean, and my favorites from the Let's Dance album - Modern Love, Let's Dance and China Girl. This is enough for me - I would have been disappointed had I bought the two-disc."
4,good disc,"Great compilation of Bowie tunes,Amazon shipped FAST. One song is a little off though,I'm afraid of americans is a little disturbing all in all a great disc!"
4,Good. As expected,"Good. Just as expected. I'm not a huge Bowie fan but like most of his stuff, so this greatest hits included every song I wanted."
4,Best Of David Bowie,"David Bowie is so unique in all he's done. I'm in awe at the diversity he can and has done. I'm a collector of what I feel is the best music from the 60's, 70,s and 80's and this cd was a must to complete my collection of must haves."
4,Good for a Bowie Fan,I bought this for my mother for a Christmas present. She constantly tells me that David Bowie is one of her favorite musicians so I found this to get for her and I'm hoping it makes her very happy.
5,my favorite cd of all time,"I can't believe all these years I could've been listening to David Bowie and didn't know it. I got David Bowie's Greatest Hits cd, because I liked the song ""Fame"". Well, when I listened to the 2 cd's I was floored. Most of the songs that were on there I didn't even know he sang! I was like, ""Oh, my God; he sings this? I love this song!"" I had no idea what I was missing all my life. His music his awesome!! When you listen to this, you will find yourself standing up and dancing without even realizing it. If you never were a David Bowie fan, you will become one. If you already are, then this cd package will become your most cherished possession. Get it!!"
3,Everything the casual fan could ever want,"The two-disc ""Best Of Bowie"" features all the hits and non-hits a casual Bowie fan could ever want--and then some. Plus, it's always nice to hear the remastered versions of old songs (Space Oddity almost sounds like it was re-recorded). The only problem I had with this collection was the awful cover art. ""Best Of Bowie"" beats ""Wingspan-Hits And History"" for worst artwork of the decade."
5,bowie bowie bowie,"this is my favorite cd i own. you can leave it on repeat and its as good the 4895743095th time as it was the first. ""Under Pressure"" is my favorite song on the cd."
3,Here they are...,"...all your favorite Bowie songs on one convenient compilation! Poorly engineered, shrill and hollow sounding. But have no fear, the pain is short-lived, as many of the songs are the ""single version"", a little shorter than what you may be used to. Maybe that's the price you pay to get twenty songs squeeezed onto one CD. Three stars is not a knock against the selection of songs, or David Bowie. This CD just SOUNDS bad. It is weak, tinny and uneven. I have some of these songs on cassettes I recorded from vinyl which sound better than this CD. So if your stereo can't reveal the faults and/or you don't know the difference and/or you just don't care, buy this one. It's a real humdinger."
3,Greatest hits without Diamond Dogs?,"Overall this is a decent collection of Bowie hits, but how can it be called ""Greatest Hits"" without the inclusion of one of his true masterpieces Diamond Dogs? Unfortunately I overlooked this glaring omission too late, after I made my purchase."
5,really the best,I have always been a part time fan of Bowie so I figured why not at Amazon'sprice. I didn't realize just how many Bowie songs are among my personalfavorites until plugging The Best of Bowie in the CD player. Every song isa hit for my money. This CD stayed in my car for almost a month before Imoved back to the rest of my normal rotation. A must have.
5,A great assemly of Bowie music,"I admit I am not the world's greatest Bowie fan, but I really like this CD set. While this may not be the best assembly of all of his songs, I too, like many others can think of tracks I would have liked to have seen on this CD, its still great. With a career like Bowie, I don't know who can put together songs that will fill only 2 1/2 hours that will please most. Songs are remastered wonderfully, and I feel show a great representation of one of the most influential artists of the last thirty years. While this may not be the collection for the serious Bowie fan, I think it will fit the void for many of us how haven't collected a lot of Bowie over the years."
5,"Best Compilation Yet, But Here's What's Missing...","I gave this five stars because it is Bowie's most complete compilation yet and it contains remastered original recordings. However, in my opinion it is a shame that it is missing -StarmanLoving The AlienJohn, I'm Only DancingSorrowOh, You Pretty Things(my most major disappointment is the exclusion of Starman!)"
3,It Has All The Hits But I'm Not His Biggest Fan,"This is a very good Greatest Hits compilation for the casual David Bowie fan. It includes many songs that span the man's career from Sufragette City to Fame to Modern Love and more. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, these songs are played so often on classic rock radio stations, there seems to be little purpose in purchasing this unless you do not listen to the radio too often.This compilation would rate a 3 and a half stars if amazon allowed me so. However, I give it a three because I really do not like Fashion, Lets Dance, and China Girl. This Is Not America and I'm Afraid of Americans are kind of ho hum. And TVC15 and Cat People are missing. Otherwise its pretty good."
2,"Where's STARMAN, Where's SORROW?",Well it depends on the version you pick up. Different countries have different track lists. Look for the one that has these two tracks (ie. Sorrow and Starman) and you will have a decent compilation.
3,confusing description,"Apparently there are two different movies by the same title. I ordered the one pictured with Van Johnson, thinking it would be a murder mystery and was disappointed, because it was a romantic story. The acting is very good as was the picture quality, but the story is predictable (a little like Dark Victory, but not as good). The reviews on amazon review each movie, but show the same picture for both, making it just as confusing."
4,Possibly life changing.,"At first the plot seemed like Ten Little Indians depicted in several movies in earlier decades. The last 15 minutes or so will very possibly change the way in which you look at your personal life and those of your surrounding friends and family. It was such a life affirming message that after I watched it on Netflix, I ordered a copy for my personal library to circulate to my adult children and grandchildren. It has the potential if a viewer has not become jaded by the vicissitudes of life to actually change your values and increase your happiness. I do recommend it."
2,The Invitation (Lance Henriksen is Inviting!),"Let me start off by saying I like Lance Henriksen as an Actor, I like his work I don't care for this movie. It's pretty Obvious from the start, and I hate the ending. It is neither Much of a Mystery nor much Scary nor entertaining."
2,pretty bad,"i enjoy lance henriksen's acting. he's been in tons of movies and television programs and displays his diverse acting in all kinds of roles. unfortunately, this is a stinker of a movie. bad acting all around. lance plays this type of guru who invites some friends to his island for a dinner party. the party falls apart as he poisons them so they can share in his visions. that almost sounds interesting, but this is more of a lame fantasy island than anything else. the best thing i can say is rent it if you must, or are curious about it."
1,Ridiculously Small,I can't believe how tiny this thing is. It wont even allow you to make a blossom for a medium sized onion. It's useless to me. Only buy if you plan on using onions that are about the sizes of a head of garlic.
3,returned it,"Looked well made... sizing was odd. I'm not a large girl at 5'7 1/2 ""and around 140 pds. Being said there are things I wanted to flatten and I also thought it would be sexy. My hubby....not so much!? He is more of how can you get that thing off kind of guy. So I'm still looking for the perfect combo... for him and for myself. Girls like to feel confident and sexy, men just like sexy and easy to get out of."
1,Be careful,"About a month or so after purchasing this product, mold start growing on the plants in the bottle. Not safe."
4,Rockin' & Rollin' Souped Up Surf,"The album is a witness to superb instrumental guitar playing musicianship. It lives up to the title Monster Surf: Surf Songs that Really Rock. Hoey does a great job giving new head-banging life to the old Safari song Wipeout. He also does a wonderful job playing old Ventures covers such as Pipline and Walk, Don't Run. If you are interested in instrumental guitar played with abandon in a souped up surf style, this is an album not to miss."
4,Worth slogging through...,"Some readers might find this book a bit of a challenge in terms of Greeley's analysis of his years of sociological data, but stick with it... out of the swirling mist of numbers emerges a fascinating study of modern religion in America.Greeley's sociological sleight-of-hand manages to address (and smash) many myths about the Catholic church. If you think belief is declining in young Catholics... if you believe they are leaving the Church in record numbers... if you think they shed their Catholic consciousness (what Greeley calls their ""Catholic imagination"") the second they quit Sunday school ... well, you're in for a few surprises.So buckle up and stick with this book... it's a wild (and inspiring) ride!"
3,an answer to old-fashioned sterotypes about Catholics,"this book refutes the sterotype that Catholics are working class, uneducated, conservative fundamentalists who blindly pledge allegiance to and follow some old fat guy in Italy. Are there still people out there who believe such stereotypes? I guess i was naive to doubt it.I thought this book was a little irrelevant considering its date of publication, but there are still many people who accept many myths without the least pause for doubt or consideration. For them I recommend this book, and for anybody who wants to understand Catholic Americans."
1,Atrocious,"This movie is absolutely awful. Good lord. How do these scripts get MADE INTO FILM? An absolute waste of time, film, and money. Oh, so you mean Moranis got picked on by Arnold when they were kids, but now they're older, and he's not so bad a guy, but Moranis is still spooked? Oh, and Moranis' son is now picking on Arnold's son? Oh, brilliant! Greenlight! COME ON! THIS IS FILTH!"
3,Big Bully,I thought this movie was pretty good. For some of ya'll who hadn't seen this movie it's pretty funny. But it's mainly for kids though but it's still a good movie.
1,Big Bully,"This is not a very good movie, but it passes the time. I would not recommend this movie unless you are really bored and have nothing else to do."
4,Another Childhood Favorite!!!,"It had been a long time since I watched this movie, and I finally got to refresh my memory. I loved this movie ever since I was a kid, and it's still funny. Moranis and Arnold were perfect together. When David Leary was a kid, he was constantly bullied by Ross Bigger (Fang) When David and his family moves away, he tells the police that Ross stole a moon rock. Years later, David and his son return to town and David becomes the new creative writing teacher. He finds out that Ross is also a teacher at the same school and continues to bully him again. David soon realizes that he must stop running and face his demon once and for all. I highly recommend BIG BULLY!!!"
4,A brilliant but tricky piece,"This is a brilliant play. I saw it twice in London and wouldn't mind seeing it again. It can be enjoyed eqaully by those who know little or nothing about Quantum Mechanics or its history, and by those who know quite a bit about it -- a remarkable achievement in its own right!But... The play critically depends on the perfomers and it may be hard to see how good it is without actually seeing it performed -- and performed well! Hence I somewhat hesitate to recommend it to those who haven't already seen it or are about to see it."
3,Easily loses the audience...,"This is a well-written tale about two scientists in conflict about what brought them together and what tore them apart. It's well-written, and I'm sure it can be very well-acted. But I imagine there are very few audiences who keep up with it for very long. It's terribly involved, very wordy and would lose an audience before long. Eventually, it would be a great play about performances, but not about a story. Strange then it would win a Tony award.I would recommend it as reading material, and not much else."
1,emperor's new clothes,"this is a typical case of the emperor's new clothes. the subject matter is provocative, the concept seductive... but the execution betrays the writer's complete inability to dramatize material. it's a giant yawn that any truly intelligent person can recognize as a boat missed."
2,Scent is too strong,"Roberts Collagen Gel has the exact consistency I've been looking for, but like every oil-free gel I've found so far, it is too perfumey.I don't understand why every facial gel has to be loaded with perfume, but Roberts is no exception.I order this product on line hoping maybe THIS one wouldn't smell to high heaven, but it did. I was very disappointed. It appears that I will be throwing yet another tube of stinky, oil-free gel in the trash unused."
3,Dating,"Chelsea has just recently moved to Shadyside. She is very shy and has never been on a date.A new boy in school, shy Will, seems interested in her. And at work she meets an angry but good looking boy, Sparks, who also may like her.But one of the boys is a murderer.This was an okay book, but nothing more. It has none of wow moments Stine is so good at."
5,Poor Girl...,"This is the one of the many books of the Fear Street series, and it's really good. Fear Street is a series about scary and/or supernatural events that happen to teenagers in a ficitional town called Shadyside. In this book, a sweet, shy girl who has trouble with boys happens to meet two interesting ones. Too bad one's a deranged killer, the mystery is, which one? This has a pretty good twist ending and gives a good taste of future books in the series.Pulitizer material it's not, but for young teens, or anyone wanting a quick thrilling read, this suits the bill just fine."
5,"Good book, but not great","This book was good, but he revealed the killer way too soon. I have read a ton of Stine's books, and this defiently wasn't his best book."
4,Death on Dates,"""He allway kills them then, on the first date.""Whoa this book is a sure screamer and you'll be scared.The main character is Chelsea Richards who is a scared and very new girl in the town. Se's a very shy teenager who has bever gone on a date and never been kissed.One day she's working with her dad in his restaurant when something terrible happens. Then she meets will, a new shy boy in town too. They start to dateand really like each other. Now that they are going one dates................................... they........They.........THEY read the book to find out what happens.People of older ages that really like horry and scary stories will like the book alotIliked this book and thought it was okThat is why I give it 4 stars."
3,OK book,"I love Rl Stine but this book was not one of his best!The whole story is about Chelsea Richards and Nina her friend, Chelsea just moved to Shadyside and doesn't have a boyfriend.One day at her fathers cafe she meets this one guy named Sparks and he seems like a bad boy type of guy and she also meets a nice guy and he is also new!! So, she decides to go out with with him, but did she make the right choice???I gave it 3 stars because in the begining it tells you who is bad and who is nice! ...So it is an ok book."
5,I liked it.,"I liked it. It will keep you in to it, so you wont let you stop. He my have said, who the killer was to fast. But, it keep you reading did`nt it? You think it was one guy, then you know it`s the other one. Not the one she think`s it is. You know who the killer is but, she did not. So, I thought it was realy cool. The way the FBI ..... her and her ...... from the guy that was trying to .... them. R.L.Stine keep up the good work. I thought it was realy great, how she found out who it was."
4,It was an interesting book.,I found this book alot of fun to read but what i didn't like is that we found out who the killer was to early in the book.Overall it was okay
4,A Great Fear Street Book[.],"A rellay good book.Lots of Action and Sunspence.Not the best Fear Street book,But still really good.The fact that you know who the killer is half-way threw the book is great because the main chacther is talking to a killer and not knowing it,But the reader knowing it,Is really Breath-Taking[.]You should REALLY read this book!...You won't reagret it!..."
5,One Of Stine's Best,"First Date is one of the best books in the Fear Street series. Although predictable, it still had style and substance, and actually contained some very suspensful parts, unlike other Fear Street books.The book describes 15 year old Chelsea Richards, a shy, lonley, high school student who is looking for love.She soon meets two boys, a 20 year old high school dropout by the name of Tim Sparks, and a new boy at school named Will Blakely.Soon both of them ask her out, although when she finds out the FBI are on the trail of a serial killer who looks alot like Tim Sparks, she rats him out and chooses to go on her first date with Will Blakely.Unfortunately for Chelsea, Will is the actual serial killer. His real name is Lonnie Mayes, and he kills girls who look like his mother or his sister in each town he visits.Will Chelsea's first date also be her last?"
5,suspenseful!,"I absolutly LOVE R.L Stine, his books are so incredibly visual and he has the most amazing ideas.This book is about a young girl named Jessica, who is a tad bit overweight and very self consious.After moving to fear street she meets 2 young men, one of which is a killer, he is revealed at exacatly 54% into the bookwhich i really liked, The ending was good as well. I highly reccomend it to anyone who loves suspenseful book, it will keepyou on your toes and guessing till the very end!"
5,Prayer in Song,"I start my day out everyday with this cd. It has been such a blessing for me. It is actually a prayer in song. A prayer taken directly from the Word of God. There is power in the Word. As I go through my day, I continue to take these songs with me even if the the cd isn't playing. They stick in my head and I sing them to myself over and over again. Constant prayer. AWESOME!!"
2,Overall a bad choice,The only good thing i can say about this laptop is that it looks good.They call it a amd turion 64 but it comes loaded with only 32 and you have to download the other 32 if you can find out where.The hard drive is configured for split fat 32 instead of ntfs.The resolution is 1680 x 1050 and that makes every thing super small and hard to read.I didnt think about resolution when i bought mine.I still cant figure out what this resolution is good for.Its not good for gaming or surfing the internet.The display screen is very dim set on the brightest setting.The bluetooth mouse seems to work only when it feels like it.The sound is terrible and has static.I bought mine sight unseen and am very disapointed with it.It has a very high price for such a low performing machine.
2,a battle with boredom,I just finished reading Isandlwana by Adrian Greaves and regrettably foumd it most disappointing. I had anxiously awiated its arrival.The story of the 24th at Isandlwana is one of the most exciting and heroic in all of military history.How an author can make the whole thing land with a thud is amazing. Very little space in the book is devoted to the actual battle. At least to some extent I want to be transported to the battlefield and feel the action myself. This never happened. The only place I was transported to was dreamland.
2,[cough] wannabes.,"I bought this CD because I wanted to try something new. I'm a big fan of Metallica and a lot of classic metal, and in all honesty, I think Element Eighty doesn't deserve to be listed in the genre. The bass rhythms are the same in almost every song. I'll admit, Broken Promises is a pretty good song, but all in all, they sound like a few wannabe metal stars who think driving rhythms on the bass with some screaming bad poetry make them a good metal band. Sorry."
1,It's totally boring,"Seriously, I was hoping for some really heavy hardcore stuff from this band. But it has turned out to be a total dissapointment, all the guitar riffs and drum beats sound the same, and while the vocalist has a great range in both screaming and screaming, something's still lacking in his overall abilities. The lyrics are not too bad, in fact they are not bad at all, I can tell that who ever wrote the lyrics didn't just sit down and write down whatever, there's some thought to them. I guess in that case, this album deserves a 1 and a half rating instead, but that's it. I read from one of these reviews that Texas Cries was an awesome song and Dummy Block was extremely hardcore. That is most definitely not what I got from both of these songs. Element Eighty's sound is terribly bland, which is a shame because I really see some potential for this band. They just need to work really really hard on their sound, because it is boring and is far from being innovative."
2,Another generic release in a dying genre.,"I bought this CD at a local shop, used, for $3.99. Thinking they might have something new to offer, I was eager to listen. Boy, was I wrong. It's the same generic crap you keep hearing out of the nu-metal genre. Frankly, I'm growing tired of nu-metal. Everything sounds like everything else. Scream, sing (or whine, in many cases), scream, vent, blah blah blah. Simple music, simple songwriting, simple this and simple that.Another thing that really bothers me about this band. They are called Element Eighty because the 80th element on the periodic table is mercury, the heaviest of them all. Are these guys implying that they are the heaviest of the genre? Heaviest of metal? What a joke. I have to laugh at that. A lot."
1,Am I missing something?,"Am I missing something here? This band is HORRIBLE. WTF ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT?! I heard the song ""Broken Promises"" on the radio, which I must say is a pretty tight song, but this band is not as good as that song would make you think, in fact, they're really not good AT ALL. The music is bad and the lyrics are stupid (you can tell by the song names). And as far as saying that this band is better than Sevendust...Evilbob80, you're a moron...this band WISHES it was in the same LEAGUE as Sevendust. To say something that dumb is an insult. But since we're on the topic, if you wanna hear some good music, and not some Element 80 CRAP, buy Sevendust's new album, it's WAY BETTER than this junk."
2,could have been better,"Although it's only $9, it still feels like a waste of cash.The cd never really gets interesting. The vocals melodies stick too closely to the music. It would have been nice if the vocalist tried something a little different, the product as a whole could also be a lot more musically mature.The Track Rubbertooth sounds under produced and sticks out like a sore thumb, If I were these guys I would have rather left that track off the cd completelyI'll keep an eye on these guys & hope that their next cd is better"
4,good,"first off, i'm not into this whole nu-metal stuff at all... i'm into stuff more like mnemic, cipher system, diecast etc. but these guys caught my attention... i first heard them on the Need for Speed: Underground soundtrack (back in 2003) and decided to buy the CD (in 2003... decided to write a review on it now). When i first played it, i was pretty surprised. The singer is great and shows a lot of emotion when he is singing/screaming. Guitars are good too. The only problem is that i would of liked to hear more from the drummer... but, overall, its good"
4,For it's genre the CD is very good,"I am constantly looking for new bands or bands under the radar. After wearing out my Sloth and Darwin's Waiting Room, I was yearning for some more new music. Something both very hard and melodic at the same time. A singer who can hold a note and also pound your ears with appropriate screams, a band who's sound is both hard and refreshing. I found it with Element Eighty! They really hit you hard with nu-metal type guitar riffs and excellent vocal quality. The songs are a bit formualmatic and choruses are slightly redundant in theme but overall it is a great CD and will keep you energized. If you pick it up you won't be disappointed. Texas Cries and Slackjaw are good choices, but overall the whole disc is nice."
5,E-80 begins their rein!!!!!!!!!!!,"E-80 fans rejoice!! The major label debut album is finally here!! Passionate lyrics and hard-hitting guitar riffs continue to rock those who've been following E-80, and will surely drawn in and capture new listeners as well. David will tantalize you with his in-your-face, emotion-filled words, while the rest of the band provides a never ending assault of hard-core, intricate melodies. From old favorites like ""Bloodshot"" and ""Scars"" to new additions like ""Broken Promises"" and the ever-addicting ""Rubbertooth"", this band from Texas will keep your head nodding and continue to rock us for years to come."
5,Totally Amazing,"The cd is AMAZING! I love E-80! I've been a fan for 2 and a half years and nothing is going to make me change my mind about their music! If you haven't heard them, I highly suggest that you do!"
4,Great album,Element Eighty is a great band with great guitar sounds...I love these guys...I suggest buying the album...its definately worth it!~*PeAcE*~-Diana
5,Element Eighty Rules!!!!!,"This is one of the hottest bands I have listened to in a long time. They are at the top of my hot list. Every time i listen to the cd, i get a different feeling about it. I am a musician, and what they have done to the industry is going to be big. I really enjoy the cd, and look forward to new stuff from them."
5,Mercury Rising!,"This is a very amazing metal CD that sounds very Dallas, if you liked Pantera or Drowing Pool, you should buy this CD. It's fast and heavy for the most part and very in your face and blatant with the lyrics. If you can get ahold of their locally released CD Mercuric, that one is even better. Many songs from that were redone for the self titled and most of them for the better. Anyways this band is on the rise so check em out."
4,Dang skippy,This is the band sevendust wishes it could be! Slow grooves and real guitar solos make this an must own album.
5,Element Eighty,Element Eighty is an awesome band. So of course the cd is too! Definitly buy this album. You won't regret it!
5,Element Eighty is Brilliant,"This is my favorite band, I even perfer them over Black Sabbath and Into Eternity. Get them heard, you will not regret buying this CD. This band deserves to have their voice heard there talent is so amazing and very theraputic when angrey or depressed. They actually have something to say unlike what is expossed in the media everyday. My favorite tracks are Good Bye, Rabies, and Pancake Land. The vocal reflection on the eigth track had me listening all day. Buy it, love it."
5,awesome band from Texas,"I have been a fan of Element Eighty for over a year now, so I have heard their ""original"" works, but their new cd is just mind blowing. All the songs are great even though some don't sound like their original version. This cd really displays how talented these guys are. If you dont have it you don't know what you're missing."
3,Nu- Metal With Promise,"That these guys toured with heavies Sevendust isn't surprising considering the tight bludgeoning rhythms on ""Parachute"" and ""Blackjaw"" sound like ""The Dust"" with different vocals. That singer David Galloway can actually carry a melodic hook and guitarist Matt Woods can actually do more than thump away goes a long way in separating this group from the rest of the downtrodden nu-metal horde. The viritrol spit on ""Bloodshot"" and ""Dummy Block""(where Galloway claims he's going to make someone his b**ch) sounds genuine and not forced, unlike many of their compatriots. This is a very harsh, tempermental album that is probably something near what Pantera would sound like if they came out now. An unapologetic slab of fierce nu-metal."
5,Success as many of us know it is very illusionary and false.,"This book is a wake up call for many Americans in this society. I find it very appalling to know that many of us are drastically killing ourselves over money and materialistic things. It's sad that we place this ""stuff"" above the human life of others as well as ourselves. Plus given the fact that ignorance breeds ignorance, it's a vicious cycle from generation to generation. Hopefully, many will capture the reality from books such as this one that our American society will rise from its slumber."
4,Nice headset,"I bought these for work after becoming concerned about wearing traditional magnet type headsets for long periods of time. They're fairly comfortable. The sound quality isn't great, but i listen to voice files and not music files...so these work well for that purpose."
2,Another excellent effort,What another great album from Randall and the guys. Got this a couple weeks ago and haven't taken it out yet. At first listen there are definitely different things on this album than the others. The sound is a bit more raw and pure than on the other albums. I had read that this album had a different approach than his others and quite frankly I was worried. But after my first listen I quickly realized that it still had the same awsome songs and songwriting that's always present on Randalls albums. The soul and passion of Randall and his band never wans...it just gets better and better. Everything you liked about any of the other albums is right here on this one. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. You won't be sorry. UPDATE!!! I did mark the wrong number of stars.. THIS IS A 5 STAR CD>>>NO DOUBT>>>Please forgive me for the typo.
3,Honda Mirror,"Good OE match and fit. Easy to replace. The mirror worked great for a little while. In less than six months, it the glass loosened & now it vibrates."
3,Honda Civic Drivers Side Mirror,The mirror looks and adjusts fine. The mirror itself appears distorted when driving. I had previously purchased the same mirror for the passenger side and there is no distortion. Maybe the surface of the mirror is not completely flat?
4,K Source replacement Mirror for 92-95 Honda Civic Sedan,"Received Mirror in a timely manner. The mirror fit very well and was essentially identical to the original OEM mirror. I was so pleased with this mirror, that I ordered a new replacement mirror for the drivers side also."
2,Hard to get to the 'meat' of the book,"In searching for different ways to pay for college over the next couple years, I came across this book. I was drawn in by the ""Creative Ways"" part of the title. This book does contain some very helpful, relevant information. However, you must dig through cheesy, cautionary tales of mishandled financial situations and Bible verses in order to get there. I would suggest ""How to Go to College (Almost) for Free"" by Benjamin Kaplan for students looking for ways to boost their college funds over this one."
3,Salangai,"There is no description given for this bell. The title states that it is four rows, but the picture only shows three rows. For a dancer, it makes a big difference. Also, there is no clue as to the material used. It is not possible for a dancer to purchase this without these clarifications. The authentic dancers do not use leather."
3,Wrong Product Shipped,"I ordered Bharatanatyam Bells - 3 Row. Even called the store to find out the exact description of the item being shipped. When I opened the package, I found out I got the WRONG item - 2 Row Bells. Am waiting to return the product to merchant. Very disappointed with my FIRST order."
4,Pretty Interesting stuff,"A better way to look at this book is how you can get in the zone. What I mean by that is there is a lot of refrences to how athletes can slow down time. As in slow down a hundred mile and hour fastball,or how time stands still when you come into that final lap neck in neck with another competitor. So perfect timing is now referred to ""get into the zone"" in modern day sports.There are some good tips also on astral projection. Healing at a distance. Meditate. And what I mean about good tips is,there is no beating around the bush. It gives you practical methods and tells you dont get frustrated with practice it will come. Practical meaning easy to follow. Self explanatory. Thats whats needed in todays world. Just get to the point. This book gets to the point. It covers many subjects. But its all total info. No fluff."
4,A good guide to the HACCP Auditor Test.,"I bought this book to give me some understanding of how to pass ASQ's HACCP Auditor test. Even though this book is somewhat short, it had enough good information to make me pass this test in October 2005. HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point and is meant for food safety. For those who work in the food industry, or even those who provide products to the food industry, HACCP is needed to ensure the safety of our food supply. This book is a general overview of HACCP and is not meant for any specific industry. However, those who read it was understand the context of what to do in setting up a HACCP program in their specific business.This is a nice informative book about HACCP. Shoppers should understand that AMAZON gives lower prices than those of member discounted ASQ's book division. Buy your ASQ books through Amazon because it is cheaper."
3,"Not my fav Helen Lester book, but...","I love most of her books, just didn't like the storyline of this one as much. I loved the illustrations though (as with all her novels) and I believe all her books interest a wide range of readers."
4,Feelings,"I find that my 4 year old granddaughter really responds well to Helen Lester and Lynn Munsinger, as do I. Which made this a perfect one for talking about the feelings of her 2 year old brother."
3,Redefining Competition in Health Care (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition),Redefining Competition in Health Care (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)Redefining Health Care: Creating Volume-Based Competition on Results.(Book review): An article from: Business Economics
5,Fantastic!,"Even my husband loves this album. When he can't run outside or do Nordic track, or bike, he runs around the house to this! I listen with my Ipod when mall walking. Very inspiring. Prior to hearing this last fall, our favorite worship leader was Messianic worship leader Paul Wilber,(favorite album- ""The Watchman"") but now we love both. Geri"
4,essentail book for polar touists,Ernest Shackelton is the hero of polar exploration. He would have given anything to have the advise given in this book.
2,Nice shirt - but very big !!!,I ordered a medium at I was swimming in it ! Also the beads looked kinda cheap to me ! I returned it for a refund.
1,"Needs wider lens...more scenery, less road","The concept is great - but it needs a wider lens and/or different editing. Too much of the time is spent looking at the road, with just brief glimpses of the beautiful scenery.Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVD #4 California Coast"
3,Cruisin',"Nice videos with good music, helps pass the time during a workout. Scenery is nice and helps prevent boredom in the exercise routine."
1,Where's the bike?,"First, the bad. Bike-o-vision or car-o-vision? This was not filmed from a bicycle. I expected a cycling video, recorded from a bike, and for good reason. It's called Bike-o-vision. Second, the video quality is borderline terrible. It's not professional and it's not even from digital. This was done from an old analog video camera to tape, and maybe from years ago. Third, the case is cheap and my dvd was scratched-up due to sliding around loose during shipping. Fourth, it's pricey. 15 dollars for this? The good, besides the deceptive advertising and poor quality, it's better than absolutely nothing when indoor cycling. Check out Seek Out Cycling. The Colorado bike trail is a nice ride on film, and they are actually filmed from a bicycles."
3,An Old Chemistry How to Book,Quite a relic. I'm amazed that I was able to find a copy still available. Old time chemistry set stuff dating back to the 1940's.
2,Expected more from top line chefs,"I was very excited when I received my book. Unfortunatly my excitement turned to dissapointment as I thumbed through the pages. While the book was filled with easy to do garnishes it was elementary and below my expectations. While the beginning of the book had some good points and conveyed a general understanding of garnishing, It was less than what I expected from 4 well educated chefs."
5,Great garnishing book!,Great garnishing book. Pictures are amazing and easy step by step directions.Love the glossy color pages in the center of the book.Great addition to my cook book collection!Nancy
1,Stop - save your money,I bought this for my son as websites claimed this explained the electric chair routine - it doesn't! Arranging stooges in the audience may be how some do it - but this paper pamphlet is a rip off. Please don't be tempted - it will tell you nothing.
4,Good Physics,"Karplus does an excellent job of explaining fundamental physics and chemistry concepts using the particle model of matter. As a high school science teacher using the modeling methodology, I found this book very helpful. His discussion of energy is especially helpful and I like how he breaks things down into the micro vs macro domains. The book also has very interesting side notes about the scientists who contributed to our current understandings of matter. The texts also reminds the reader that science is a process with many individuals contributing and using each other's ideas."
3,The gift,Didn't like it as much as some of his books. Butthis one was entirely different from what I had read before by this author.
3,There's better out there.....,"After the last compilation of basically classic club hits that have already been on plenty of compilations previously, DeVito FINALLY decides to put together a mix of diva-led songs that are somewhat current. The only problem is that it just doesn't flow well....and the songs jump around from heavy to light to heavy again. Ultra Dance 5 is much better than this. Add a couple bucks to the $12 you were going to spend on this and go with Ultra Dance 5. You'll be glad you did."
3,I'm not overly impressed.,"The ""digging"" action is fine. However, the ""trike"" style base is very unstable. If you want your 4 or 5 year old to tip over all the time in a big jumbled mess, then by all means buy this item.Also, you would think the being on wheels would make this thing more portable, i.e. the kid could push it to another area to dig another hole. NO WAY. As mentioned above, it is way too unstable to push anyway, even if the kid is OFF the item. Don't even attempt to scoot the item around while actually sitting on it - see comment one above about tipping over.Northern Tools has a digger that is less than half the price, with what appears to be a more solid base. The company ran out of the digger over Christmas, so I bought this overpriced Kettle piece of crap instead. Wish that I had not done so, but my son wanted a digger for Christmas."
2,Wish it was better,"I really wish this book had been better; there is definitely a need for a book length history of the American Revolution from the ""People's History"" perspective, but this book doesn't cut it. The book is basically a compilation of loosely organized notes and anecdotes from secondary sources on the American Revolution. This book would have redeeming value if the author had either done some significant primary source work or done a good job of stringing together past research into a coherent narrative, but he fails to do either. This book best serves as a bibliography for ""People's History"" of the American Revolution, but not as a good work in itself."
1,Socialist retelling of the American Revolution,I picked this book up in the hopes of hearing about ordinary Americans different struggles and perspectives during the American Revolution. The actual quotes from journals and the story of the people who wrote them is amazing however the authours interpretations of events and writing is obvioulsy scewed towards a current political agenda. I dont think this book lends itself to a clearer perspective or a true retelling of the events that inspired people during this time period. I absolutly will not recommend this series of books to anyone.
4,Simple but thorough guide,"Hiring new employees is a painful process especially if you have to fire them afterwards. Bad hiring will result in deterioration of business performance. The author with his nice and simplisitic approach divides the book into eleven chapters that covers in a successive way starting from the basics of advertising to defining the job to asking the proper questions. It emphasizes principles of asking questions and interpretting them. Mr Fry did his best to provide examples and simplify interviewing techniques in easy to use format. Actually, I read it twice because it takes time to digest all the information and decide which sequence of questions to use. I like it and I do recommend it. If you are busy person and need quick reference book, this is the book you need."
4,Surprisingly entertaining,"I found this movie while channel surfing. I like JLH in Ghost Whisperer, so I stopped and started watching just where he find out he has another chance. I tivo'd it and I'm glad I did. It was just a lovely, sappy story that kept me company folding laundry on a snowy Saturday afternoon. I liked it a lot. I really liked that he learned and grew from the experience even if it last that long. The biggest surprise for me was that Jen can sing! I guess I'm dating myself by saying that I didn't know that. She's good, the music was good and I am going to go in search of the soundtrack. Enjoy!!!"
5,Great romantic story,"Well, I am a romantic sap, and a big Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, so I give it five stars. Macho guys may not like it all, except for some parts with Jennifer in them, looking very sweet. If you like a good romance, and one that is not like every other one out there, this may be for you. It has some elements which are similar to those found in SOMEWHERE IN TIME, and in GHOST. Fairly good production values, some good cinematography, one great landscape. Quite well written, I thought. There is sort of an epilogue which I almost thought was not needed, but all in all, if you like a good romance, I would say this is a ""buy""."
4,Destiny,Being a big fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt and enjoying her on Ghost Whisper and Party of Five. I defintly wanted to see this movie. She did a very good job singing in this movie which is another talent of hers besides being a good actress. The movie had a good theme knowing that you can see something happening in the future would you go back and alter it and perhaps save someones elses life.
5,""" I don't want to be adored, I want to be loved""","Get out your kleenex. What does a woman need from the man she loves? Just for him to love her back. That is all this movie boils down to. Men out there, this guy gets a second chance, but chances are you won't, so sit with your woman and pay attention to this movie. This movie is beautifully written, and I think it should have gone to theatres, I loved it...definitely on the top of the TV movies I have seen."
4,Good Story,"I think this story is really good. The characters are believable. The only thing, there seems like a lot of scenes where Jennifer Love Hewitt is in her ""underwear"". It was a sweet movie, it could of done without that stuff. :-( Don't know why movie producers seem think movies need that. :-( Other than that, it was a cute, feel good movie. :-)........If you like this, have you seen that TV Christmas movie, THREE DAYS? With Kristin Davis and Tim Meadows? Same kinda story. Love it! :-)"
3,Good Music,The music in this was good wish they would have included more of it. The storyline was a good one...but wasn't Gweneth Paltro in a movie similar to this one???This was a good one to see...suggest this one if you don't have anything else to see.
2,Terrible acting . .,I am only giving this two stars due to the location settings . .but I thought Jennifer Love Hewitt's acting was AWFUL! She posed through the entire movie and I was so aware of her attempt at acting. Sorry - she was just dreadful in this.
4,"A retold story, but message is still true","This is a simple film which is based on a plot that has been used 100 times before, but it still is worth reminding ourselves from time to time what is most important in life.A simple message and good performances by Hewitt make it an uplifting innocent film to enjoy."
4,it is quite entertaining!,"Jennifer Love Hewitt picks a good project to work with! my problem with this movie is that it came out just shortly after another show which was based on the same kinda thing, reliving the day to save a life, of course I'm talking about Tru Calling, one of my fav tv series! but I was quite surprised at how they handled things in this movie cause it is still interesting though the plot has been done before. It is meant to be a tear-jerker but this movie is alot more realistic then it could be & there are alot of nice scenes that make up for a re-done plot. It is a good movie! the acting is good, it's just a sweet movie so that's why I'm recommending it to the viewers cause it could've been alot worse. Jennifer has always been a good actress but now she's finally picking good projects, like Ghost Whisperer & Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber! looks like she's found her calling, lol!"
2,Same Material - Different Author,"You would think Arturo would come out with something more interesting. Most of this book is designed to work on tone quality and scales. If you have a good method book, you don't need this one. He needs to write a book on improvising, phrasing, technique, and solo's. Tell me how to do those fast runs on the trumpet. I guess the pro's don't want to share their secrets."
1,THE STORY IS TOTAL B.S.,"The story is about a guy that actually snitched on his so called friends! he was a scared kid that was hanging around with a hooker that ended up doing 7 years in a california prison for not only robbing the first guy but then had to do it again. Ben never snitched on anyone. As a matter of fact he was the last person to get arrested. Lee was the first to be arrested. He was caught by the manager at the Travel Lodge in WLA writing down the license plate number. If you want to know the real story then go get the police report (from Beverly Hills P.D. its public record) and read the ""Real Story""."
1,Don't Bother,I bought this book on the reviews posted here and was not happy with the results. I followed the recipes for two loaves - one came out a round brick and the other soup. The author spends too much time on the little ditties about his children and not enough on the bread. I've found that a little imagination is a lot better than him.
3,Good recipes for breads and desserts,"The recipes use everyday items -nothing ""gourmet"" or hard to find. The bread recipes have all come out great-even better tasting than the book that came with my machine. It also includes dessert recipes which is a little different for a bread book. The only thing I don't like is that I have a larger bread machine and don't really need the 1Lb loaf recipes that are called small. The large recipes are really only 1 1/2 lb loaves-nothing for 2 or 2 1/2 lb ones. But overall the recipes are delicious and easy.\"
5,This is one terrific cookbook!!,"If you own a bread machine, this is the cookbook for you. It has many tasty recipes for many different types of bread. My bread machine has been a great time saver and this cookbook has been a valuable resource."
4,Pretty awesome book!,There is a lot to choose from here. Can't wait to try these recipies! I was really happy with the price. Less than $7.
3,Lots of recipes,I bought this for my sister in law who got a bread machine for the holiday. She loves it and likes how many different bread options that come with the book.
2,Not happy with any of the recipes,so far the breads using Canadian floors have been very unsucessful
5,book,"Excellent book! It kept me glued to it for 2 days, until I finished it, then I wanted more of the story. It ended too soon.Lynn Austin always puts historic elements into her books. This was about 3 immigrant sistes and their trials and tribulations getting to America from Sweden on the ship as passengers in steerage. Their experiences on Ellis Island were riveting."
5,The service was exceptional,"Lynn Austin is one of my favorite author's of ""insprirational"" fiction. This book did not disappoint me. As an aside, I love the service of Amazon for it's reminders to me of publications and also giving me ideas for other books that I might enjoy."
4,"Fragile, but Fun","My grandson loved this truck, but some of the small parts broke off pretty easily. He still loved playing with it."
5,Refreshing New Viewpoint,"Readable and original -- shows how financial wealth can grow much faster than production. Shows how corporations can create financial wealth, how wealth propagates from one country or region to another, how the people with financial assets will probably accumulate much more. Makes the current debate about growth, recession, income distribution, tax cuts, etc. sound narrow and unimaginative. I opened this book and found myself in the middle of an illustration that was something I'd been curious about for a long time. The book pulled me right in. It's cute and clear."
4,Entertaining and well done,"""The Wily Wastrel"" is a well-written, entertaining Regency romance that I enjoyed. I haven't read the other books in this series, but it makes me happy that Ms. Kihlstrom is again producing Regencies. Though not an intensely passionate fan of the genre, I generally enjoy Ms. Kihlstrom's novels, and if you are a fan of her earlier work, I think you'd enjoy this one.BTW, Regencies are not hard-hitting issue novels, so I don't understand the review that called this book ""fluff""."
1,Haven't got yet,I haven't got the book which i have purchased on date given in the mail.I am really not happy with things happened with me by amazon.com
4,Alley Flowers,"The opening song of Jolie Holland's Catalpa ""Alley Flowers"" is one of those rare transcendent special musical moments that only seem to be captured when the artist is not really trying to make a record. I'm reminded of Karen Dalton at her best or Skip James singing ""Devil Got My Woman"". Private and mysterious, yet offhand and appealing in a throw away subconscious way, way back when..."
3,Danby marble,"Good book as a source of hard to find information about New England marble.The History And Map Of Danby, Vermont"
4,The Humanistic Tradition book,The book was received in a timely manner and in a good condition. Definitely will keep purchasing my books from here.
3,Not The Full Version,"Bought this for my son's college class, and this is just a portion of the full text. Clearly our error, but frustrating to have to purchase both this and the correct full version."
1,Dissapointed,"The quality of this CD is very bad. The sound is not clear, all of the songs seemed to be muffled. Also when played, it hangs up on track #9. I returned it for a refund. You need to take this one off the market! GRA"
4,"Great, to-the-point resource","This is a great book for those who have little time to spend reading an entire book from cover to cover. You can read whatever you are interested in or what you need at that moment, due to it being divided by subject.Most all of the chapters held great advice, lots of things I'll be trying. Some were a bit heavy, for example, death of a child, etc. But just about everything is covered.From a biblical standpoint, it seemed to be pretty on target with God's teachings, and how to handle your children, regardless of age.I would recommend this as a purchase (in paperback for cost savings) and a keeper!"
1,Nonsense,"""The Obesity Research Institute"" is simply the company that makes this stuff. It's not some academic research facility. This company got in trouble with the Federal Trade Commission for saying you could lose weight without making any lifestyle changes and by taking their product. If you take this stuff, make the lifestyle changes and lose weight, it's not because of the medication. Save your money."
4,New Death Metal Heavyweights,"This band was an unexpected surprise for me- I actually have enjoyed the first album from this new, osbcure death metal band more than some of the latest high-profile metal releases.Abysmal Dawn deliver a solid platter of meat-and-potatoes death metal, just the way I like it- nice, heavy dirge riffs and speedy tremolo-picking, with enough complexity and cool time changes to make it interesting, old-school cookie monster vocals, and some standout drumming. The only thing slightly detracting from this release is it's rather short playtime, clocking in at just over 30 minutes. Even so, this is what death metal is supposed to sound like- definately recommended. This and the latest Suffocation album have been my favorite death metal discs lately, and I would like to hear more from this band in the future."
3,You mean it's over?!?,"This was my favorite book in the trilogy right up to the last chapter. The entire series is preparing for Ragnarok, and this book details the protagonist as he comes into his birthright. The only problem is, it ends before Ragnarok starts! The sequel trilogy begins 300 years after Ragnarok, so the greatest event in the history of the world, the climax of the entire series, is never shown! I was very, very bitter, and I doubt I'll reread the series."
4,yayayayayayaya!!!!!,"I love this book! I love the whole series! they are all pretty great! They keep getting better and better! I did, however, have one problem with it. Reichert keeps repeating things in this book. I think it's REALLY annoying! But I got over it."
3,Something is Missing,"The Pregnant Woman's Comfort guide offers time-tested tips and also some alternative methods to help relieve the discomforts and pains of pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum days. Jimenez' work is commendable except for the very obvious fact that she devotes only about 2 pages to morning sickness, which is one of the most common (and most miserable) symptoms of preganncy. Treating morning sickness as a blip in a book seems inexcusable from a woman who is a registered nurse and long-time childbirth educator. Some women suffer so greatly from this malady that they must be hospitalized, yet many in the medical community still brush it off and continue to offer the same tired advice, like eating crackers, drinking tea and getting lots of rest. Even though some women do not get morning sickness, it is a common enough, and serious enough, complaint to warrant MUCH more attention in a book designed to alleviate pregnancy woes."
5,Better than advertised; fast shipping!,A scholarly well written book with an excellent historical perspective on the development of Buddhism as well. The book is Incredibly well researched
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great Either","Rosiland Russell is one of the greatest dramatic actresses of all time. Tragicly, this is the musical! Roz has spunk, but when you can hear Angela Landsberry, Tyne Daly, or the immortal Ethel Merman (who created the role of Mama Rose on Broadway)on CD, it is nearly impossible to sit as Russell sings ""Rose's Turn"" flat. Karl Malden and Natalie Wood can't sing either, so we have a musical with no strong musical leads! Luckly, the score is good enough so that they are usually able to come off respectably, and as actors, they all do a great job. This film is watchable, but not as good as it could have been."
3,BUY THE ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST ALBUM,"I have heard the original cast album of the 1959 Broadwayproduction, and the cast changes made for this movie degrade the musical score enormously. Ethel Merman's songs in the show werespecifically designed to show off her voice; Rosalind Russell'ssinging is very amateurish and no match for Merman. Karl Malden is a good dramatic actor (see On the Waterfront), but he seems very awkward in this musical. Natalie Wood comes off best and looks great."
5,GOOD COPY,i CHOOSE A 5-STAR rating because the DVD is as good a copy of GYPSY as can be made. The original film was made in 1962. It was used and advertised to be in like new condition. And it was.
3,Good try - mediocre results,"In this adaptation, most of the beautiful play was lost, Mama Rose was depicted as far too chic and beautiful, and three highly competent actors had the misfortune of displaying their lack of musical gifts."
3,NATALIE!!! abs gorgeous sexy woman...wow,"low expectations for this film, finally gave it a chance and was most shocked to see Natalie able to entertain using the 'CLASSY' gimmick... she was incredible, her stage presence, perfect figure, movement, timing, and I think she only had one peekaboo shot, I am unsure how long this type of act would maintain interest without revealing more skin but a major educational aspect of this script is: ""MORE IS MORE!"". Don't fall all over exposing ur assets and titillate the senses via suspense, personality, and how could any man complain a woman who teases is not exceptionally talented to keep one stimulated to the max.... the whole mother/daughter relationship might be interesting but not developed enough for any depth which I had no problem with, and yes ROS was great but not my fav for casting, hence, Natalie fans this is a must see~~"
2,Gypsy by Rosalind Russel,"Not the best account of Gypsy. I have read better and seen more interesting presentations. With Rosalind Russell's involment, I was expecting more excitement"
5,An Under Appreciated Gem!,"One of my favorite musical films. In Rosalind Russell's capable hands, Mama Rose becomes a flesh and blood, living, breathing, and heartbraking character. She gets the pathos and the ambition and the humor and the hurt just right... I love it! The rest of the cast is also first-rate."
4,"Pretty good, but not great","This was a pretty good movie. The musical numbers were pretty good, the staging was pretty good, and the acting was pretty good. I use ""pretty good"" so much because I can't think of a better word to describe this film. it wasn't great, it was just... well, pretty good. I'm still singing the musical numbers, and think Natalie Wood was well-cast as Gypsy Rose Lee. She really shows her character's vunerability and shyness very well. Ann Jillian, Karl Malden, and Paul Wallace as Tulsa were great, too. As for Rosalind Russell, she really wasn't too bad, even though it's a bit of a shock seeing her change from wacky-yet-sophisticated Auntie Mame to Mama Rose, hard-boiled, determined, and from the backwoods. Her last number, ""Rose's Turn,"" was really great, but I couldn't help thinking that I wish I'd seen Ethel Merman in the role. So, this wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't excellent."
2,The Biggest Miscasting In Movie History!!!!,"I give this version 2 stars, 1 for Natalie Wood, who is superb, and 1 for the story itself. Rosiland Russell who was a great actress,(Auntie Mame, The Women), but definately not a singer, is miscast big time!! If they had done the right thing and cast Ethel Merman, the combination of Merman and Natalie Wood would make this a classic today, which it definately is not. The Bette Midler version is far superior."
3,Decent,Love the movie but the dvd was jumping a little. I don't think it is my dvd player becaus ethe rest of the dvd's are fine...Buta at least I have this classic on DVD!
2,Not enough Natalie and certainly not enough bump and grind,"I suppose it's alright if you like overlong musicals focusing on maniacal, manipulative mothers."
3,"While not Slobberbone, it's not a complete throwaway...","I don't know how many people will pick this up who were not already familiar with Slobberbone. Accordingly, the majority of listeners/reviewers are going to compare this to Slobberbone. Compared to Slobberbone, it REALLY sucks. Taken on its own merits, it only kinda sucks. Personally, I have reached the point where I can appreciate the simple pop tunes (e.g. Hummalong, Unhinged, Sortsighted). However, half-way thru ""You Won't Forget"", I thought someone had replaced my Drams CD with a Chicago CD. Skip tracks 7 and 8, and you are left with a mediocre, listenable CD, if only due to the fact that I still enjoy Brent Best's voice (no matter how overproduced). Think of the drop-off from Slobberbone's ETYTWRWWT to Slippage. The drop-off from Slippage to this album is about twice as steep.Bottom Line: Buy this CD, and make your own decision 'cause Brent Best deserves to be a millionaire based solely on what he did with Slobberbone."
3,New Direction,"I'm guilty of being one of the many Slobberbone fans loking for something that carried on that tradition. So I gave JUBILEE DRIVE two listens and shelved it. Totally wrong on my part. This record is like Slobberboe meets Sgt. Pepper. It took me throwing it in a jam box and hearing it on a job site to really HEAR what Best is up to. It's a lot BETTER than Slobberbone. Best is a real artist--which means he's way out ahead of any guy who can write in a sour review while sitting in his yellow-stained underwear :). That ain't me, but I think a few of the previous reviewers are looking down as they read this. . . Keep going, Brent!!!"
2,a real dive...,"As I type this review, the Drams are playing live about 2 miles from my apartment in Atlanta. Why am I not there? Well, I had planned to be. I was stoked to hear about this new band and this new record, having been a DIEHARD Slobberbone and Brent Best fan. Well, I died hard. Out of pure excitement, I ordered tickets to tonight's show prior to the record's release. After ten attempts at trying to even begin to sorta *like* this disc, I decided to stay home and eat the ticket cost. The record is clean pop rock. And I'm not mourning the loss of the fiddle and the banjo. There is none of Best's growled delivery. Little of the honest and powerful hooks that made Slobberbone great. The production is junk. Best's suddenly clean voice is buried in the music and the harmonies are flat and whiny. And the hooks are so weak they're almost non-existant. Other than that, it's superb. Suffice it to say that there's quite a bit of disappointment here."
3,If you don't know about Slobberbone you'll probably like this CD,"If you don't know about Slobberbone you'll probably like this CD. If you do know about Slobberbone, burry 'em in the back yard and move on to Lucero. While this CD is not as good as the Slobberbone stuff it doesn't deserve the bashing it's getting. It's obviously a new direction and not aimed at keeping Slobberbone alive. They would still be Slobberbone if that were the intent. It's still Brent writhing the songs and you can hear a hint of the old stuff on this record. The main problem is that now it's all happy and shiny. Brent decided to get his dog fixed after getting him back from the ex. Buy it used from one of the many disappointed Slobberbone fans."
2,Not very useful,This book seemed out-dated.It had many numeral codes not used in NY State.It did not have explainations with the answers.
4,stroller bar is pretty useful!,i found the stroller bar to be quite useful and probably much easier on the wrists than a pushbar. it fits perfectly onto the Kettler Happy Trike.
1,Does not work w/ Kettrike Air Jumbo,"Purchased this item with the intent that I'd use it on the Kettrike Air Jumbo Tricycle. THIS ITEM DOES NOT WORK WITH THE TRIKE! The instructions are not altogether clear, the diagram supplied shows how to assemble it, but makes no mention as to why there's a second mounting bracket and stem, nor does it show which trikes it will work with. While I'm pleased with the build quality of the tricycle, I very disappointed in the lack of information regarding the push bar, and the poor documentation that comes with it. Ascertain if your tricycle will work with any of the push bars before purchasing."
4,Good read For Both the Professional and Parent,"This is a good book for both professionals and parents, who would like to know more about the science behind their baby's behavior. However, there is not dry statistics. Rather, the science is clearly explained with many ""real life"" examples. In the table of contents, each section is clearly labeled, so you can either read the whole book or go to relevant chapters. This is a very good book to start exploring attachment research and issues.Brazelton is a well know scientist who is a pioneer in early development research. His neonatal behavioral assessment scale (described in chpt. 8) is the professional gold standard used by many researchers, health professionals, and child-related agencies.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in infant research and early development."
3,Not the sharpest knife in the drawer,"The first time I used this knife it was so dull that it rolled off the carrot I was trying to halve and cut my finger instead. I have since had the knife professionally sharpened, but it seems to me that a new knife should be very sharp."
4,A very detailed guide to authenticity,"I like this book very much. It is a great guide when your looking for authenticity, it's very detailed. It covers all 356 models (Speedster, Roadster, Carrera,...) from 356 to 356C. It has a fair price, so: defenitely worth buying!"
3,Make-A-Mends boot,"Love the stle of this boot! Unfortunately they arrived with a split seam - surprising for the cost as well as for Kenneth Cole name.Had to return them.Overall - calf is quite wide, not for slim legs, and the ankle bags a bit. Shame because the style is right on hip."
5,"Fundamental, full of tips","Excellent overview of bridging, switching (both in LANs and WANs), and routing. Covers extensively all IP routing issues but also describes how non-IP networks get routed. Handbook for anyone who wishes to know what made switching and routing come ""closer"": faster and more efficient as in multilayer switching, label switching (MPLS), and optical switching."
3,Beautiful scenery,"I used this for the first time today. I saw beautiful trees, great rocks, and beautiful bodies of water. Unfortunately I have NO idea what any of it is. There is no commentary on the DVD. I am not familiar with the area and would love to have learned something while I was riding."
2,Poor Fit - 2005 Dodge Ram,"Received super fast shipping with super saver. Product construction is good - fit is poor. Had to struggle to get the pin into the receiver. Large gaps between the L2R and the bumper on either end. I will keep it, but I would not spend the money on it again."
4,"A nice, simple bossa nova album","Carlos Lyra was one of the founding members of Brazil's bossa nova revolution... This is a nice mellow, old-school bossa album, recorded in Mexico in 1970, when Lyra and other Brazilian luminaries were in cultural exile. This dips a bit into iffy pop territory, but mostly it's exactly the kind of gentle gem that fans of lounge, bossa and jazz are all looking for. Recommended!"
3,OK,"Note: these outfits do not fit the American Girl dolls. They are cute and very well made, with lots of neat accessories, but they do not fit either the American Girl doll or the Gotz 18"" dolls. These outfits run small, and the shoes don't fit at all."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"This product is not compatable with Windows XP as was advertised. I called the company and they referred me to their website for help. I went there, and there was no help from a live person that I could find. So, I have wasted my money on software that has been opened and will not work with my brand new, up to date, computer."
2,Boring and disappointing,"This novel by Hungarian writer Gyula Krudy (1878-1933) is set in the early 1900s, and deals with the lives of two struggling actresses in Budapest, as they intermingle with the local intelligentsia of the day. Written in 1913, the novel does not have much of a plot, which seems to be Krudy's intentions. The liner notes claims Krudy was the Hungarian Proust, but this is overdoing his talents way up. Dull and disappointing, the couple of hours I spent in reading this were totally wasted."
3,Tomb Raider 3: The Official Strategy Guide,"If you are looking for a step-by-step and turn-by-turn guide to the game, this book is NOT it. Though the book is often helpful, there are times when you are left with no idea what to do. The authors either leave out critical information, or give ambiguous and/or erroneous directions.I attribute these mistakes to poor descriptive writing skills, a lazy proof read, and/or lack of cash to fund the correction process.However, the book does give you many puzzle solutions that you could not have found on your own. It also gives you a fair (as apposed to good) insight into what the game's authors intented for you to do. Consequently, my three star rating. You must decide for yourself whether your gain is worth the frustration caused by the author's mistakes.My recommendation is that you check-out the game maker's on-line guide, and then decide whether you want to spend cash on this one."
5,"¡AY, QUE LIBRO TAN BELLO Y TAN SABIO !","Te demuestra el enorme talento que tiene la mujer, y que NO ES COMO EL DEL HOMBRE...SINO ENTERAMENTE DISTINTO, MÁS AGUDO, MÁS PENETRANTE, MÁS FORTALECIDO .Este libro NO SOLO TE DA LAS BASES MÁS TALENTOSAS PARA ADMINISTRAR UNA EMPRESA O UN NEGOCIO...sino también tips para VIVIR BIEN !"
5,Book was just fine.,Book came quickly and in great shape. It was just what I was looking for and was almost in new condition.
3,Good reference,I use the book to develop my training courses for engineers and development of my business presentations. A good tool I keep in my office.
4,Stylish diaper bag,"HUGE diaper bag, i can fit everything I need for a plane trip and long weekend away. It packs really nicely. There are 5 inside pouches. It keeps all the small things in their place. The changing pad is nice although i never tie it back up, i almost wish it didn't have the ties. I use this bag on a daily basis too. I get so many compliments on this bag. The insulated tote is handy, although i wish the handle was snap on so i could attach it to the outside of the bag."
3,missing grommets,"Its a fairly thick strong tarp, although I had to buy another one due to holes showing up in last years tarp. But the thing that upset me was that when I got it out of the bag a set of grommets dropped to the ground. Since I had no way to re-attach those grommets I wasn't able to use that hole to attach to the fence. Normally I would've sent it back, but I had hired someone to help me put it up and he was standing there waiting to get the job done and rain was expected the next day."
2,"Nothing special, few problems, underwhelming quality","I am not a big fan of the product. Doesn't seem as thick or high quality of material as a 10mil tarp that they have at any big box store. Not a terrible quality, but not as high as the same priced option at your local store.The biggest issue is that it looks like the grommets are poorly attached to the tarp. Many of them are already slightly separated from it and there is a gap between the metal of the grommet and the tarp material, and this was even BEFORE using it. Right out of the package on the day it arrived.Needless to say I am just hoping it makes it through the winter without coming apart. I can tell by the quality of it that it is only going to last 1 winter covering my already canvas covered boat.FYI, a 12x20 tarp fits a 17 ft v bottom alumnium sylvan very well, even one with a windshield."
1,CRAP,"CRAP, CRAP, CRAP and thats putting it nicely. You can get this same tarp at your local walmart for 8 dollars. I am so ..... mad about this rip off. these are light duty, no way heavy duty and as far as super heavy duty you must be .......kidn me. burn your money at least you will get to see it be wasted. DONT BE A FOOL ON THIS TARP. ONLY GIVEN IT A 1 STAR REVIEW CAUSE WONT TAKE YOUR REVIEW WITH NO STARS"
4,"Good price, decent tarp, a little light weight.","This tarp is as expected. It is a good price for a decent item, but it is a light weight tarp. I would buy it again at this price."
2,"Good product, wrong size","The quality of this tarp is good, but the width was not as stated. I was able to add tie downs to my carport to compensate for the extra foot in width so I could get it tight across the frame work, but I could have done that with any local tarp purchased too."
2,Not heavy! 'Good' tarp. They're all overpriced everywhere. $30 for mine.,"1/11/2013: This is not the heavy ply and rope reinforced as advertized. These are massively mass produced, and not in Detroit. Time will tell how well it lasts. 4 plastic reinforced corners. FedEx left it at 5pm under the only spot that leaked on the porch, good thing it was not electronics."
4,Good replacement canopy for Motoshade 10x20,Can't beat this price for a decent replacement canopy for a 10x20 Motoshade. Do not worry that this is 12x20 as the Motoshade is big for it's specs as people have said. Thanks to all others with the same comments/advice. Recommended product!
2,Don't be mislead,"The material is of good quality. However, it is too short both length and width wise to be considered a ""true replacement."" It should be at least another foot longer on each side, otherwise, any amount of rain will collect and cause you grieves. The tarp does not drain water properly."
5,Great Alternative to Shelter Logic Replacement Cover,I read the reviews and thought I'd try it. I am glad I did. I kept the tie down bungies and rope from my old torn Shelter Logic top and used them to tie down the tarp and it fits great. It looks like it is made of the same material as the original top at about 1/3 the price. Time will tell if it holds up but it looks great.
1,Total Disappointment,"I purchased two of these tarps based on 4-5 stars from others. The tarps we received were definitely not heavy duty (I took them to store to compare thickness with those on shelf) and 1/2 the grommets were installed facing up and 1/2 were installed facing down - they should all be facing one direction. Most importantly, as soon as we attached a bungee cord from the tarp to the boat to hold it in place, the tarp ripped at the grommet. This happened with 3 grommets. Very disappointed in the quality of this item."
4,12x20 Super Heavy Duty Tarp,"My only complaint at this time is with some grommets. They don't appear to be the best quality and are uneven. One of them has torn just by being attached to the trailer. It did not tear through, there's just a rip in the grommet area, but I expected better quality."
5,LTJ Fans Buy This!,The Pez Collection is a collection of Less Than Jake songs from there previous albums put together on one CD. It has all the best songs on this album and no Less Than Jake fan should be without it. It's only eighteen dollars for twenty-four of their greatest songs. A definite buy.
3,"Nice combo CD, from a great band.","It's pretty simply stated that LTJ has worked hard to accomplish this collection of ska music. However, some of the songs are too crazy to handle, in my opinion. I've been a great fan of LTJ for a long time, but ""Pez Collection"" has been losing its firm grip."
3,This CD isn't that great; gets really old,"LTJ's ""Pez Collection"" used to be my favorite CD. It had all of LTJ's greatest hits, like ""Son of Dick"" and ""One Last Cigarette"". However, as time went by, this CD faded from me. I used to listen to it all the time, but now, it's collecting dust in it's slot in my CD holder."
3,good back up compass,this compass is durable and the temperature gauge is a great feature. but i wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a serious orienteering compass. the dial does not display all degrees. so fine tuning your direction is practically impossible w/o guessing.
2,Disappointing,I ordered this on seeing the image. It looked quite attractive given its sleek design for everyday use. But i was pretty surprised when i received this. The pendant is unusually small and the chain isn't long enough.Not worthy enough of its given price.
4,Almost too cute to use!!,"My mom gave me a set of these measuring cups last year. They're currently in my china cabinet with my Christmas dishes. I'm sure they work great as measuring cups, but I enjoy having them on display. My mom also has a set and loves them. She uses them all the time and says they have held up well."
2,Great Early Recording - But Beware!,"This is a great collection of 30 classic Australian songs, however it is not remastered! I highly recommend ""Brilliant From Birth"" which contains 63 remastered songs with great liner notes! Remember - you get what you pay for."
3,Police Procedural with warm protagonist,"This is a readable book. I liked the main character, but the plot was not cogent enough to engage my long term memory after I finished the book. This book is a good choice if you need a bit of mind candy while slogging through some intricate epic that's dripping in Tolstoyan angst and intricacy. You'll need the contrast in order to keep the plot straight.I fear that the author hit the standard 2nd novel hump. The series has the potential to be an engaging winner. The first novel in the series got good reviews, but unfortunately, I didn't read the first in the series. Don't give up on this author, they show real promise with their characterizations.The book is worth reading if you are one of those people who read four or more books a week, you can polish it off in a few hours, but the plot might not stick.... You WILL remember the protagonist with warmth and even some affection."
1,"Starts off with a bang, ends up needing to be shot","I was very excited about this book when I first started it. I thought it was well-written, interesting, and that it was going to be one that I could not put down. Unfortunately, the author veered off into an unnecessary hospital emergency that left the reader trying to determine how this was related to the plot- it wasn't, it only was a buffer that detracted from the story line. After this the story became more and more frustrating and boring.It started out with promising development of characters that turned into boring and tiresome creatures that had no depth. The detectives assistant being the worst, but also by the time the 'hero' had said ""You got it in one"" for about the 100th time, I personally found myself rolling my eyes and counting the pages till the end.The only redeeming features of this book was the historical aspects and description of Richmond, Va."
2,Just plastic,"I bought these for my daughter off her wish list. I'm glad I bought these from a non-featured merchant for $14.99, because if I had paid $49.99 or up, I would have felt totally ripped off. They probably do work as well as the other reviewer said and lighter is probably better, but I was expecting more than just plastic from a ""professional series"" set."
1,Review of Omar Sharif Bridge,I chose this product because I thought it had Omar Shariff's endorsement. Now that I'v tried it I can't believe that he endorsed it.
3,OMAR SHARIF BRIDGE,The card display is to small. It requires you to be very specific when choosing the card to be played. It does not allow you to set up any conventions or delete any you do not wish to play nor is there an explanation of what conventions are being used. To just allow you to chose the style of bidding does not give you the conventions used.
5,Terrific Oldies Collection,"For anyone who likes oldies this is a magnificent cross-section of music from the 1950's to the 1970's including some very rare tracks. Most importantly, all tracks are original versions by original artists. Buy it, you'll enjoy it."
5,The best gothic metal band ever!!!,"Nothing more to say but......TYPE O NEGATIVE RULESGet this single, worth it for the video that is on here as well. never was played on MTv at all. Peter is hot too."
4,Everything Dies Review,"Though depressive agression dies in a sliver of hope, Type O Negative highly defines Death with This Release. As a long time listener of ToN, I strongly advise all to purchase."
4,Good camera bag,"This is a good camera bag for the price. I have several other camera bags of varying price, and this is one of the best values. It is solid enough to protect the camera it houses but not so bulky that it can't be carried with one hand. The major downside is that it is small. I would like a little bit more room, but beggars can't be choosers."
4,A great find!,Paige is an incredible album! It seems that many stores are unable to keep the CD on their shelves!
3,Product description wrong....,I purchased these to compliment my Winterberry dishes because they are listed as dishwasher safe. Was dismayed when they arrived to find that they are in truth handwash only. I could have bought them at a more economical price through Pfaltzgraff directly but was looking for dishwasher safe.They are sturdy and beatiful but did not want something that needs the care of handwashing to ensure its beauty. Will now be used only occasionally instead of on a daily bases during the Christmas/winter season.
2,Rusted out screws,"Had this set for 2 years, Now one screw has fallen out and the other one is rusted . Not a good item to buy. Beware."
1,Buyer Beware!,"First off, they are not rigid enough to pick up anything. I've dropped so many things with these tongs, I've started to curse them every time I use them. Secondly, they are POORLY MADE. Both of the red ends fell off within 2 weeks of light use, leaving the metal screw lost in my food.These are a terrible waste of money. Buyer beware!"
1,Amateur cook,JUNK !!!!The tongs are held in by small rivets into silicon. Good until one or two washings. Made a nice addition into my trash can.
5,Love and Logic attention challenges,"I am a great fan of the Love and Logic series. This book does it's best to explain why we have so many children with these issues, and how to help them become successful learners. I highly recommend their materials."
3,Unable to acturately rate as it was given as a gift.,All other Love and Logic merchandise has been very helpful.
5,Parenting with Love and Logic,"This is a win, win for anyone! Aunts uncles, grandparents, teachers, etc.. The only thing to remember is that EVERY child is an individual, and what works for one, does not work for another! Only you know your child's temperament/personality! Some great ""ideas"" in this book though!"
1,Better looking in the picture,I recieved this as a wedding gift. In the picture it looks very lush and regal.Not so.The print on the comforter is just that. It's printed on the fabric. It was cracked and separated. It looked awful up close.
4,woNderfuL,i read this book out of pretty much force b/c of a project i had to do... but after reading it i was gLad i read this book. this book started out sLow b/c i didnt want to read this book but after like 10 pages i was hooked. this book is really good and very well detaiLed. i gaurantee that if you start you wont put it down until you finish.
5,Hunters of the Shadows Great book 10/24/2002,I am a big fan of Anita Blake the Vampire Slayer. And this book by Mark Haeuser is right up there.The first page is exciting and it only gets better.I couldn't put the book down. I am hoping this is the beginning of a series of books with these great characters.
3,Brazilian-American,I am from Brazil I live in the US for 12 yrs. So I listened to Claudio Zoli when I was a teen back in Brazil. It is a good CD but it is not album recording so I think if you like the real deal from the time you were a kid and listen to this stuff while kissing your first boyfriend /girlfriend you are better off with the original recordings of Claudio.
4,Works well,I needed to drill some holes in the door frame for the latch and these cut a straiter and faster hole than some other cheap fostner bits I got free from Handyman.
4,I like Dave,"I don't know why I missed this movie when it debuted. It might have been because several reviews I read were negative. I don't know why. It's a lovely comedy about perceptions. What makes us human? Is it because we were born on earth? Or is it a deep-seated spiritual thing that compells us to treat others kindly that makes us human? In the beginning of this film the aliens believe themselves to be superior to lowly humans. Until they live among them for a while. They've come to TAKE. But they've somehow become taken with humankind. I liked the reverse effect. As for the actors: Everyone gave good performances. Eddie Murphy is very talented. Gabrielle Union, splendid! The supporting cast was excellent as well."
2,"3 STARS FOR THE KIDS, BUT NOT MUCH FUN FOR ADULTS!","I like Eddie Murphy, but since he's gone G, I have been disappointed in most of his films. To put it bluntly, his family movies are just too corny for my taste. 'Meet Dave' is a pretty far fetched fantasy comedy, but really it's just another romantic comedy disguised in this little kiddies sci-fi adventure.Most of the jokes aren't funny and the first half of the film is really boring with Eddie doing a bad robot impersonation in some unfunny but all too familiar comedy shtick!It's not Murphy's worst film, but it's far from his best. If you have kids, then give it a shot, but I think most adults wouldn't be missing much if they skipped this mediocre film."
2,Not the worst Movie in the world!,I can't say I didn't have a few laughs because I did...but I could have waited for this movie to come on cable I didn't need it to be apart of my collection.Bottom line is I don't know what's going on with Eddie Murphy because his movies just aren't the same...they have lost some mojo and this movie just proves it!
2,Happy with product not with delivery,"Bought it for my godson easter as we saw movie together and had great laughs (and he did again he told me). Poor delivery after over 2 weeks, product hasn't yet arrived even on UPS. Amazon swiftly replaced it and sent it at no charge. So great. BUT...then received returning ""eticketing"" and was told to resend a package which hasn't arrived otherwise my credit card would be charged. Told Amazon they should hassle carrier which hasn't ""kept his promise"", organise quality service rather than hassle customer. Especially when i'm in europe and the whole issue happens in USA, it was a present and i have to hassle friends i wanted to treat because of unefficient, uncustomer friendly carrier. I told friends not to bother. If i have to pay twice, so be it. Next time i won t use Amazon in USA - not because of their service but because of their carrier unservice."
5,The Search is On!,"Alright if you want to read reviews to find out what the movie is about look at others' reviews. I just want to tell you how me and my friends turned watching this movie into a drinking movie.Do you remember the days of the Bob Newhart Show and how everyone played ""Hi Bob""? Where everyone drank whenever they said ""Hi Bob"" and after 30 minutes you were blitzed.Try a variation of this where everytime you see a boom microphone you drink. The same result will happen; by the end of the movie you will be drunk.I cannot believe that it was such a prevalent error in this film, but us drinkers are reaping the rewards.Thanks Eddie, those little guys are even more funny when you are hammered.BOOM! Drink!"
3,goofey,"It's a good, safe family film. It's kind of fun and strange at the same time. I think it would be well suited for pre-teens."
4,Amusing and Charming -- Much Better Than I Expected,"This film is far more entertaining than I expected.Depending on the movie I either like Eddie Murphy or can barely tolerate him. This is one of his keepers. With near perfect comedic physical humor, Murphy plays a believable space ship and ship captain. Some of the dialog is comedy gold. Murphy's robotic awakenings and learning curve are laugh out loud hilarious.Amazingly clean with the exception of a few party scenes where the crew reacts to new stimuli including mojitos and salsa dancing. A number of crew members (the weapons expert is exposed to the Rockettes and is never the same, the tech guy finds MySpace) play out some stereotypes that tend to get annoying, but do add a bit to the story. Plenty of bodily function humor. The mostly family friendly storyline makes for some predictability.Fans of Murphy's Daddy Day Care and Dr Doolittle and fans of Galaxy Quest should find much to like."
3,Science fiction /comedy ....pretty good,"Eddie Murphy is sure no chicken, he takes on parts probably against hismanagers wishes. The man's got guts. I was impressed with the budget andthe quality of this project. It might not be the perfect movie, but itwas entertaining and had a good message. The effects were above averageand i like the ending.....Enjoy"
4,"Good, but not excellent....","This book certainly explains all the basic requirements for all FAA medicals, but I believe the author is too repetitive, especially when he explains 100 times how important the medical is. The whole book could have been a lot shorter. The only interesting part was the nutrition section, and the hypertension chapter."
2,A real disappointment,"The book contains a variety of recipes that call for ingredients such as snails, mussels, shrimp, kidneys, beef, chicken and veal, but the step-by-step photographs were disappointing. They didn't show techniques or processes of cooking, just, on average, three snapshots of adding chopped ingredients to the pot or arranging ingredients for a salad. This book, along with the Essential Italian cookery book, didn't walk you through the recipes step-by-step, and the selection of recipes were disappointing to me, since I was looking for lighter and modern French fare. The recipes in general contained fairly simple instructions, but they were mostly for heavy dishes and ingredients."
1,Not the classic look for another,"These cards are so difficult to match. The images looks so similar that I have a difficult time matching them up and have to help the kids make their matches.I do like the smaller size of the deck, like a standard deck of cards.I highly recommend you don't purchase this version of the game."
5,It could have happened,"This is one of the great Cold War movies made during the '50's and '60's, and, like Fail Safe and Dr. Strangelove, it does an excellent job of showing how screwed up the anti-communist mindset became during those years."
5,A great thriller about power and the men who wield it.,This is one of the best films ever made about the inner-workings of Washington DC and the fragile state of our democracy. Frederic March gives what is inarguably one of the best interpreations of a US President ever put on film. By the end of the movie you'll swear there once was a President Lyman.
5,"7DaysInMay One of the best, a Classic","If you do not believe in the Constitution, don't watch this Movie. There is a remake called ""The Enemy Within"" Staring Forrest Whittaker and Jason Roberts,Made for TV, Murder at 1600, twists into Seven Days, don't miss them either.This movie is a ""What If"", movie and ""How could they do it"" Scary but,a grade A; a Classic! Seven Days is in Black&White and adds to the feeling that it could have been on a covert camera, except for all the A List actors in the cast. A darn good yarn in a fearful world. So if this Movie was re-made twice! Go see the original."
5,7 days in 2 hours,"A well written and well casted political thriller drama. The characters are quite believable. The tension gets so thick you can cut it with a knife. At issue is the attempted takeover of the government by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs fo Staff. The motivation of these characters is not personal glorification, but loyalty and patriotism. This movie has philosophical weightiness to it but does not beat you over the head with it."
5,Seven Days in May - A CLASSIC,"The film has always been a favorite and this rendition (DVD) is very well-done. The Director's narration give new life to the production values and insites into the stellar cast. Rod Serling's script revamps the book a bit, but the revisions work!"
2,Mayday,"Funny how both conservatives and liberals can cook up their own paranoid fantasies from the same sets of facts. This Kennedy-era melodrama hearkens back to both the October 1962 missile crisis and the Nuclear Test Ban treaty of JFK's administration. When some people on the Right claimed the country was being handed over to the Soviets, two liberal Washington reporters cranked out the novel ""Seven Days in May"" about a military coup to topple the government. The movie is a faithful re-creation of the book and it's plain ridiculous. Burt Lancaster plays an updated Air Force version of Douglas MacArthur whose nefarious scheme is foiled by a smug band of patriots led by Kirk Douglas. Frederic March's President is so un-appealing you wish somebody would overthrow him, and poor Ava Gardner, 15 years on from being the most beautiful girl in Hollywood, looks like death warmed over. Rod Serling's script is riddled with a pomposity he usually edited out of his ""Twilight Zone"" work."
5,7 days in may,excellent movie based on a best selling book. douglas and lancaster really relate to each other as to how the american military gets involved in the political system.
4,Seven Days In May (VHS movie 1964),"Seven Days In May is one of my favorite films. I found the VHS tape purchased through Amazon to be of excellent, almost new condition. The price was right and delivery was on time without problems. If a similar need arises in the future, I would very likely purchase using Amazon. ""Seven Days In May,"" (1964,) is a politcal thriller about an attempted military takeover of the US Government. It is somewhat dated, but very entertaining nevertheless. Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, who often worked together are at their very best.Roy C Thomas"
4,"Almost 50 years later, still an exciting movie","It was pure fiction in 1963. Imagine, a hard-line general(Burt Lancaster)trying to overthrow the constitutional government of the United States. Almost science fiction, as a matter of fact. But after so many political and military crises, in American soil and abroad, dictatorship sprouting all over the world, ""Seven Days in May"" is as new today as ever. Even with the good guys (Kirk Douglas, Fredric March)fighting it à la Hollywood."
3,a less accomplished joe r. lansdale,"this earlier effort from lansdale displays many of the qualities that set him apart today. the easy yet intelligent and witticism-packed style. the unflinching attention to gory detail. the page-turner plotting. this, however, is just a shade less skilled in all of these departments than, say, his hap & leonard series. and although one always has to suspend disbeief a tad when reading lansdale's books, this time i think he stretched things a bit too far. worth a read, if you've finished everything else of his, though."
3,Recovery,The book was a little disappointing. It covered the topic and had some very detailed number crunching charts. But for the money Four-Wheeler's Bible is just as good on recovery and has many other topics for the same price.
2,Not very useful for non-beginners,"OK, as other reviewers and the author acknowledged, this book is relatively heavy on math to calculate the amount of pull or traction required or available, etc. But the fact is that nearly no one will sit down and calculate how much help they need to get unstuck. What they want to know is safe and effective methods and techniques to maximize the tools they have available - when they try that, they will know whether or not to start walking. The book provided little information in that area that any experienced ""stuck-ee"" won't already know. It's a pretty good book for beginners, but others are better. It is of very little use to anyone who has used winches, chains, jacks, etc. numerous times, and was very thin in the area of safe rigging techniques."
1,Surfer Hits,poor compilation - bogus actually - don't pay more than $2 for this. I got mine in the cutout bin on CD - read the review at allmusic dot com.
4,An Interesting Take On An Old Story,"Roger Kahn turns his formidable skills on two calcified pop culture icons and makes them fresh and worthy of our attention. Kahn reveals Joe DiMaggio as an Ordinary Joe who was grist for the sportswriters' mill, a comic-book reading kid who turns into a suspicious and haughty skirtchaser in New York. Kahn reminds us that Marilyn Monroe was a troubled girl who grew up to become a complicated woman of great ambition and intelligence but, sadly, was still troubled. He weaves the tales of their lives into the context of their times and helps us understand what brought them together and tore them apart. Kahn pulls no punches, and perhaps tells us a bit more than we want to know, but he is a brilliant writer -- a brilliant writer -- who knows how to tell a tale so that it rings true and is entertaining at the same time."
1,Joe & Baseball: A Memory of Love,This book is terrible. The title is very misleading as it tricks the reader into thinking that the book is about Joe and Marilyn's relationship but it isn't. This book is all about Joe and baseball. The only part of it that has anything to do with the actual relationship is the last chapter and even at that very little information is actually given. I don't know enough about Joe's life to know whether the information provided in this book is accurate but enough of what is written on Marilyn is not. This makes me wonder if Kahn actually did any serious research on her or just wanted to use her name to sell some books.
3,Not what I thought,I bought this for my 3-year-old assuming that you attached the bubble solution to the gun and push a button and the bubbles automatically come out. Not so...you have to pour the bubble solution in a dipping dish and dip the bubble gun into the dish and then squeeze the trigger to make the bubbles come out. Way too complicated and messy for this age group. Wished I would've spent a little more and got a more automated type. Kind of disappointed.
2,Too messy,Too messy and time consuming for my 4 year old to dip the gun in the dish of bubbles...and the 2 year old keeps grabbing and dumping the little dish....
3,Needs Bateries,I thought that this toy was hand powered and that the fan was powered by pulling the trigger button. Instead it is all battery and it goes though them fast. I like simple toys with as little that can go wrong as possible.
5,"VERY, VERY GOOD","This is a very informative and entertaining look into the special forces of the US. I like the way each chapter has its history and missions explained. Especially interesting, are the brief accounts of each branches' successful and failed missions. All the way up to the current fight against terrorism, it gives people a look at something almost as good as the RAMBO and BRADDOCK movies. A very good and informative reference for Army Rangers, Army Special Forces, Army Delta Foce, Navy SeALs, Air Force Special Operations, Marine Force Recon, Airborne units, 10th Mountain, and CIA Paramilitary Groups. Everything is good, except the constant reference in every chapter to JFK and his concept of unconvertional warfare. I take it these two guys were fans of his. I highly recommend it."
4,The complete basics :),"This is a good book for a ... price. Although it doesn't go into great detail on any one Spec Ops group it does give good information. Each group section is broken down into history, training, and missions that they have participated in."
5,Excellent Book,This is great reading for people with an interest about SOF. Those of us that have served in the SOF Community will appreciate this book accuracy and attention to detail.
4,"good information, good reading","this book tells of history of different special operation forces. however it should go into more detail with each, but i guess this makes a good eye opener of what each group is and how they're different. there were some cool things about the air force, but i thought they could've removed the part about coast guard."
4,Faberware knives,this is a GREAT knife for a GREAT price! It easily slices through whatever you need. I have also bought the larger one and it is GREAT also!
4,Comfortable to use,"Thanks to other reviewers I decided to buy this. I needed a second 6"" knife. Already own Farberware set. However, I thought it would be duplicate of 6"" in my current set - which I'm very happy with, came with 6 steak knives too. It is not the same. But I have to say close enough & it will serve us well."
3,"Very small book, many examples but not too helpful","If you really want to know about reading and understanding Hieroglyphics, I would not recommend this book.What you really want is: ""How to read egyptian hieroglyphs: a step-by-step guide to teach yourself - by Mark Collier"".This book is a very junior version which doesn't provide nearly enough examples or transliterations for the reader to make any sense of what the language was all about."
3,Not Very Good for a Lonely Planet Guide,Lonely Planet guides have been my guide of choice for some time but this one was not up to snuff. It just wasn't detailed enough. Two areas that bothered me was nothing about the weather and I could not find the specific snorkeling information I wanted and that was one of the prime reasons for going to Tahiti and purchasing the book.A general warning - the dollar will now only get you 75 polynesian francs instead of the 100 when the book was written. Not Lonely Planet's fault - the dollar has just sunk but what used to be expensive can now be almost ridiculous in price!
4,Excellant Guide book,"This book did a wonderful job of not only preparing us for the journey, but help us get around. We have now been there three times to three difference islands, and each time it preformed well. Although with all travel books they get out to date in a year or two, you should always call a head to verify critical information."
4,"James Scissom's Review of David Landes' ""The Unbound Prometheus""","Length:: 9:58 MinsJames Scissom's review was made as part of a critical review assignment for the Spring 2012 Economics of Technology seminar at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, taught by Art Diamond. (The course syllabus stated that part of the critical review assignment consisted of the making of a video recording of the review, and the posting of the review to Amazon.)"
3,Good Brush,I like the quality of the brush but somehow I would like stiffer bristles. It seemed sloppy basting my goods. Like a wet rag dabbing would have worked the same way.
4,Challenging workout - good complement to cardio,"This tape is so good, I just purchased a replacement tape because the one I had broke. I enjoy this tape the most out of all my Tamilee tapes because it is the most challenging. (I also have the entire Buns of Steel Platinum tapes, the original Buns of Steel Abs tapes, and the Buns of Steel Quick Toning series.) Usually, after using a tape for a couple of weeks, I find them too easy. Being that I wouldn't bother to workout unless I feel challenged, I need an intermediate/advanced workout. This tape works - I really could feel the burn afterwards. It has alot of lunges, squats and pelvic tilts. On lazy days, I don't use weights, but most days I do to increase the burn. This tape is for strengthening, so I use it as a complement to cardio."
1,Time I wish I had back,I was very interested in this book having been recommended to it by a good friend. Unfortunately I found it to be disappointing in its research and conclusion and an obvious emotional attack on psychiatry.Reference to scientology in the title pages was a welcome relief as it pointed out the bias of the author(?) and its intentions. Wish I had seen the scientology reference prior to reading as I could have used those hours on something important.
3,Not For General Interest,"In my opinion this book is not a user-friendly book for the general reader that is interested in the topic. The book covers the start of the ""Final Solution"" by documenting how in the early 1930's many German psychiatrists were using sterilization, then major brain surgeries and finally death to treat children and adults that had any number of physical and mental conditions. The book goes on to say that this because an excepted practice within the German government in dealing with these ""less then perfect"" people and eventually lead to the full scale use of the gas chambers at the death camps.The book is dealing with this topic from more of a clinical point of view. The authors are doctors and they're writing style is more suited to a medical journal then a general interest book. I would think this book would appeal mainly either to psychiatrists interested in the topic or someone that is doing research on the holocaust."
5,An important book on the subject of WWII,"I think any comprehensive study of WWII should include this book. I read ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" in high school, as part of my required reading for history class, but I think this book is much more complete in terms of what actually influenced Hitler, and the undue and horrifying influence the psychiatrists had on civilization.What is even more upsetting is the realization that this same ""science"" continues to hold power over our culture. The proteges of psychiatrists who advocated horrific ""experiments"" and treatments including execution, are now influential psychiatrists in practice or in universities. This is frightening, folks, but I think it's important that we take a good long look at this book and the data presented.My thanks to the author for presenting this material in such a compelling manner."
1,Scientology diatribe,"As a doctor,I was honestly interested in learning about the role of Psychiatry in Nazi Germany before, during, and after WWII. Instead, I found the book is a heavy-handed anti-psychiatry diatribe, clearly of Scientology origin (acknowledged in the title pages). This was very disappointing to me. I know that any science/philosophy can be perverted by forces in the culture and was disappointed that the authors were not more academic in their treatment of the subject. By the end of the book, it had completely digressed into just the type of emotion-based, projective attack against psychiatrists as a group that the authors accuse the pre WWII psychiatrists of using against non-Aryan ""inferiors"". Very disappointing and unsettling, the hatred and blind projection of evil lives on, it just has a new face."
4,A must Read For all Teens,"This book has it all, love, hate, family, friendships. Reading this book lets you no that you are not alone and someone has felt the way you are feeling. Chicken soup teaches teens the real life and how to surive it.the stories are intersting and real life stories of teenagers. This is a truley wonderful book and i invite you to read it"
5,inspirational stories,this book had so many inspirational stories. When i read many of these stories i said to myself-if these people who are suffering (depressed) and can make something good come out of a sad sob story then i definatly can make it.... from whatever is getting in my way. I HIGHLY reccomend this book if you can handle some sad stories and need a little inspiration every now and then. It definantly isn't a waste of money.... if you can really handle these amazing SOB stories!!!
4,Chicken Soup Teen,We use this book as part of our Bible Study with our teenage girls. It has real life situations and opens up good discussion.
5,Amazing stories,"I have read two of the other Chicken Soup books and enjoyed them very much. I have a teenager and when I saw this book I thought it would be good since we are all going through ""tough times"" right now. I sat down when I got home and decided to read a few of the stories and found mysled unable to stop. I cried for the girl who was made fun of and I cried for the students who expereinced such horror. But mostly I cried because I didn't have such a book to read when I was a teenager. I honestly beleive that if I had I would be a different person today. Each and every one of us needs this inspiration. Each one of us needs to remember our hearts and that we are all in this together.This book is a great tool for remembering.I suggest parents read it as well as their teens. I highly recommend it."
5,I Love the new Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul!,"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul on Tough Stuff was a book I feel all teenagers and for that matter adults should read. It really touched me. At times I cried, and at times I laughed. This book really touched home. It reminded me that no matter how bad my day was, there is someone that has gone through the same thing and maybe worse things that same day. I have all the Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul books and this is my favorite.I hope others can recieve that same joy I recieved from it. This book like the others will serve as a devotional for me. Each story has some meaning or lesson that will touch home."
5,Teacher needing resources.,As a teacher I am always looking for affordable resources. This was just as described. I have always like chicken soup. . Thank you.
2,Library has these for free,"Just entertaining and maybe somewhat educational, i regret buying it because after i did i realized that i could have checked it out from the library so before you purchase check your local library."
2,Quality not what it used to be,"I have purchased this product for years and always been satisfied, but this bottle has broken capsules and powder inside the bottle. It makes me wonder if the potency of the product is the same as before. I have another bottle to use yet, but if it is the same I will find another product."
4,Dementor Child's Costume,"This costume is very nice and fits well (size 8-10). In person, the costume looks exactly how it looks online. I only gave the costume four stars b/c the mask is a bit flimsy and could rip rather easily. Overall, my son loves the costume!"
1,Poorly made and bad customer service.,"The costumes mask had been smashed from poor packaging, which formed a permanent crease on the side of it. It also had glue stuck to one of the eye openings that the child is meant to look out from.When I called the company for an exchange or refund they told me I would have to pay for the shipping AND a restocking fee.Needless to say I am very disappointed."
5,Great taxi,"I got this for my son for his 2nd bday. He like the ""older"" sets more than the 1.2.3. line b/c the guys can move their arms. I always take away the really tiny stuff, or stuff that he could care less about like the newspaper. I didn't even bother putting the antenna on. All my 2 year old got was the taxi w/o the roof, too difficult for him, and the guy w/ his hat. He loves this thing. We've got a lot of guys so the taxi is always full. But he does put the little kids in the trunk when there is no room for them :) He can manage on his own to put the guys in the driver seat w/o too much frustration or screaming for ""Mama!"" All in all it's a great addition for any child."
2,Beware the size,"They seem to be good sandals, but the sizing runs smaller than Birkenstocks. I've been wearing birkenstock 45s for 15 years. So I ordered these, and can't wear them, they're too small."
2,Review,I find I have an arch in my right foot that does not allow me to wear this sandle. After two days of wearing them I ended up with a swollen right foot and calf with a lot of pain. I'm also in my middle sixties which probably contributed to it (Fallen Arches). The vendor was very grautious and credited my account without a second thought.
4,Don't buy this book twice!,"This book is also published under the title ""Death in the Family"". It's good but I didn't need two copies of it!"
3,This is a lightweight toolbox,The bottom line for this toolbox is that it is nicer in theory than it can really handle. Made of thin not to rugged plastic that has a hard time holding up when you actuall put things in it. Good for lightweight things not a bunch of tools.
1,Not meant for tools,These toolboxes are junk for the price. I would say the load limit is about 15lbs. They are too flimsy and I already broke two of them within one week just hauling around small item stuff. Pay the extra money and get the Stanley Fat Max.
5,Selah,"There are very few books I'd give a 10 to, but this is one of them. You can either overdose and read it all in one go (and many of you will) or occasionally snack on its lunacy.Thompson lost it years ago - mainly because he was so adored he didn't really have to make an effort anymore - but the contents of The Great Shark Hunt show him at his best, when instead of being content to comment on the world from far off in Woody Creek, he went out, grabbed it by the scruff of its neck, and shoved drugs down the beast's maw"
3,I think I shall not get on the Hunter S. Thompson train,"This is the first work by Hunter S. Thompson I have read. Perhaps I expected too much, after reading all the rave reviews. I found this collection disjointed, only occasionally humorous, and not at all shocking. I'm not at all sure what the unifying theme is. The nice thing is that since it is a collection, it can be read in bits and pieces. I give it three stars, because there were moments of hilarity."
5,I Can Always Count on Amazon.com,"This was a gift for someone else. But I was very pleased with the service Ireceived. The condition of this used item was great, and I received it veryquickly. I have always had good experiences with Amazon.com. Seems like Ican find anything I'm looking for through you. Many thanks, Amazon.com!mtnchckadeeCortez, CO"
4,the great shark hunt,The best definition of a time I am proud to say I lived through. A true example of one mans observations.
4,The Essential HST,"This is truely the most Essential Collection of HST's work. From his early experiments in Gonzo (Hell's Angels, Kentucky Durby), to Fear and Loathing across the USA to wild adventures in South America, this book almost has it all... In fact, the only real downside is the lack of Ralph Steadman's art that accompanied some of the original works..."
4,"Condition Bad, Book Good","The book was great but the condition wasn't as advertised. The jacket was ripped considerably. That said, the book was in pretty good shape and I'm happy with the purchase."
3,"once again, its all politics here","this is in the same genre as generation of swine. if your looking for another fear and loathing in las vegas type of book, i'd look into the curse of lono or maybe the rum diary. this one is more of his political side of writing"
5,Read to understand the politics and culture of the 70's,"I dont often write reviews. This book, however, was so profound and culturally enlightning, that I could not pass up the opportunity to rave about it. I was born in the late seventy's in a conservative household in Texas. Needless to say, I never knew how admirable Carter was, or the hopes of the counter-culture movement (only the failures). Thompson writes very personal pictures of people, from Muhamid Ali to Jimmy Carter to the Hell's Angels that he had the opportunity to ride with. This is a brilliant work!"
5,Fishing with John,"I love this book. Having fished in Alaska for years, I thought that the author was very accurate in her description of her adventure. I bought it (again) for my children to read."
1,Can't get it to run,"Program installed OK, however:(1) It will only attempt to start if the CD is in the drive and running. I suspect that this will be a battery life issue for a laptop.(2) When it does try to start the graphics are a bit pixelated, but before the game even starts I get an error that there is not enough memory to run (I am running Windows XP SP3, on a Core 2 Duo processor with 2GB ram) and it shuts down.I do not know how well the game works since I have not see it run successfully. I will update if I can get a fix."
4,Torrid Zone,I enjoyed the heck out of this wonderful classic! I laughed till I cried at some of the lines in this beautiful movie! 4 out of 5 stars!!!
5,Great Printer,"Great Printer. Fast, inexpensive, and reliable. I would recommend to anyone.There are many reviews that are slamming this printer because of driver issues, outdated drivers, and the lack of a usb cable in the box. You will get that with any printer, so that is not the issue. No printer comes with a supplied usb cable anymore, and they definitely dont ship with up to date software drivers.Install was not an issue. If you go on the internet and download the driver instead of installing from the cd, you will guarantee you have the latest driver available."
5,No Problems,"This is our second printer like this, it is fast and we do check printing so it has to be reliable."
1,I would not buy Hp printers anymore!,"I could not install this printer because of a false jammed paper signal. Turns out the factory turns the jammed paper recovery off to increase printer speed. What a stupid idea. Accordingly, I could not recover from this false signal; had to return printer. Also, searching on the web I discovered that many people had the same problem with other than the 1022 HP model. In addition, was unable to get help from HP. Also, software from printer did not play well with my XP system, had warning that printer software was not compatible with XP."
1,HP is guilty of false advertising,"I just bought this printer last month and it works fine with a computer that is supported with an XP operating system. Unfortunately, my computer crashed (the motherboard) and since Vista has been on the market for nearly a year now, it's impossible to find a computer that doesn't run on Vista. Moreover, if you google HP Laserjet 1022 and Vista you will see that HP advertises that the printer is Vista compatable! I'm now out of a brand new hardly used printer and I'm furious. Someone should launch a class-action lawsuit against HP!"
1,Really bad driver on 1020,"I have 2 1020's and 2 1022's . Once they start working, they are fine. But I have had problems installing the driver on 3 different computers. Last time I stayed on the phone with Tech support for over 2 hours. I gave up and bought a different printer for that computer. If the driver problem had happened only on one computer, maybe just chance. But for me the 1020 printer driver has been the driver from hell."
1,HP LaserJet 1022 Printer -- Not worth it,"I purchased this product because I wanted a simple laser printer that was compatible with my iMac. HP charges more than what they charge for the same model that is not Apple compatible. That aside, I experienced problems loading in the cartridge; the operation sounded like a freight train; and ultimately it started producing a straight dark line down the left margin after about 200 copies. I decided to return the printer to Amazon for credit. I will not get a replacement and I cannot recommend this product."
1,Never buy this printer!,"Had used this printer for about 2 years without any problem, and actually I liked it. Suddenly however, it gave me headache. Initially it gave an error message: ""The Printer Spooler service is terminated unexpectedly. It has done this x times."" Then the classic finger pointing, damn-the-customer, game began. To make a long story short, Microsoft (I use Windows) blames HP, but HP blames Microsoft. Not a big fan of Microsoft, but I think it's HP's fault, because if you do just a cursory online research, it is crystal clear that many HP customers have been frustrated by the LaserJet 1022's Spooler problem. AVOID THIS PRINTER AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Beware of HP product support,"I have an HP Business Inkjet 1100 - not even listed on Amazon now, so I'm posting my warning on a similar product. The printer worked great with Windows XP. I was very happy with it, except for the fact that plastic paper guides broke off soon after purchase. BUT, when I upgraded to VISTA, I was so disappointed with HP tech service! I can't use the printer because HP has not released an updated driver - and apparently doesn't intend to do so. There is no excuse for this. Why should I have to throw away a perfectly good 3-year-old printer because HP's support is so bad? Canon, on the other hand, provided an easy-to-install on-line driver for my 6-year-old scanner. It now works beautifully with Vista.I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER HP PRODUCT."
2,Duplexing is a nightmare,"I have had this printer for about 1.5 years now. I take online classes with digital books, so most of them I print out. I don't think I've gone once without this printer messing up the duplexing. On the second side it will just randomly lose a page and completely ruin the order of the rest. I've had to reprint about half of each chapter. I end up needing to print one set of pages at a time to narrow down the one graphic that seems to be messing the batch up. I'm almost done with school, then this thing is getting beat down in a field somewhere."
1,DO NOT BUY ANY HEWLETT PACKARD PRODUCT!!!,"I just want to warn any unsuspecting person against purchasing any HP product. They do not honor their warranties and if you attempt to resolve it with their customer no-service you will be plunged into a maze of lies, deceptions, diversions and tag team obfuscation. They have overseas customer no-service and it appears the company policy is to wear the customer down so they eventually give up and go away. I don't know how much longer HP will be able to remain a viable business with the set up they have now. Please heed my warning. STAY AWAY FROM HEWLETT PACKARD!!!"
4,Works fine.,I got this printer at Staples in mid-May. It works very well. I am using this printer w/ my Dell GX280 and Inspiron 4100.I'm giving 4 stars due to its higher price.
5,Another great printer from HP,"My wife always had the laser printers and I kept using inkjets etc for the color. Finally after much wasted ink and many frustrations with poor printouts and lousy color, I gave up on the several inkjets I have had and decided, 'who needs color' anyway for the little I do with it. It just wasn't worth the frustration. This is my first laser and I picked one that would not be too high end but I thought might be reliable. I have had it some time now and must say that it is easy to set up and use and has thus far given reliable high quality printouts. Finally I can print when I want, without cleaning heads or changing a million ink cartridges. My wife has another HP laser printer and it has been problem free as well...for a very long time. In an age of rapid obsolescence, HP printers have been a bright spot for us."
5,2007 HP printer is perfect!,"Just received mine Feb 2007. First the quickness from Amazon was amazing. Came perfectly wrapped and within a few days. I plugged it in, put the disc in, and within only a few minutes my computer installed it and put it as my default printer without even a hiccup. I had a test page printed within no time and am VERY VERY pleased. There was no written manual, just some pictures to follow and was easy! It works perfect!!!! The only thing you should know is that it didn't come with a USB printer cable (how much can that cost them, $1?). Glad I bought it- very happy!"
1,No Drivers for Windows Vista,"Can't yet rate this piece of equipment. HP still has not created the drivers for it, yet they're still selling these printers without notifying the buyer! How much would it take to put a sticker on the box - ""not Vista compatible?"" Therefore, if you have Windows Vista as your operating system, don't buy this printer!On a high note, Amazon delivered it promptly. No problem with Amazon as usual.Shame on HP. I've had this printer for over a month, still can't use it. When I first bought it and figured out the drivers don't exist, I contacted HP. They said the drivers would be available ""before the end of July."" Well, it's mid-August and I'm still waiting. Rotten bastar**"
1,Lack of Vista support unforgivable,HP can have no excuse for not having provided a Vista driver for this simple printer so long after the release of Vista (now July 07). Priority clearly goes to developing drivers for those of their printers that chew up lots of expensive color ink cartridges. With this level of support you should look at a product from a different manufacturer.
2,Nonstandard formatting,Outputs from HP 1022 will not match outputs from HP printers that support PCL 6. Applications that depend on precise print formatting will probably fail.
5,This printer is amazing!!!,"As a longtime computer technician I've dealt with my share of laser printers. The majority of them seemed to be HP, and I rarely saw any problems in them. After waiting many years to get a personal laser printer, I decided on this one.The printer is amazingly fast. The quality is also awesome. Graphics and text both come out very sharp. It's also a smaller printer and fits nicely just about anywhere.The biggest advantage to owning a laser printer like this one is that the toner is good for a few thousand pages. In an inkjet the cartridges are generally rated at 500 pages, but more often than not they die after about 250. Since ink isn't the cheapest thing in the world, a laser printer makes more sense if you do large amounts of text printing. Despite costing over twice as much as a low end inkjet, the savings comes within the first two years of ownership.If you get this printer you will not regret it, and will wonder how you ever lived with an inkjet for text."
4,Top Shelf Review,The top shelf was easy to install and will handle a cable box and DVD or VHS. I have the TV in the bedroom where there isn't very much room and this helps keep it clean looking.
3,Television Top Shelf,"I received the package in a timely manner. However, the box was damaged in shipping and one of the pieces is missing. I have not been able to use this product."
3,Okay Product,"I brought this t.v. top shelf, because my t.v. top is kind of narrow, and I was concern that my vcr and cable box might fall off, although the shelf appears to be secure and the top is more then wide enough, it still shakes a little, which kind of concerns me, I don't think the vcr or cable box will fall, but still I don't like that whenever you touch this thing it shakes, but so far nothing has fallen, and let's hope it never does."
2,May not fit for your TV,"Basically it's a good product, but it didn't fit my TV in the beginning. Why? The enclosed legs (secure bars) are too short for my TV. I contacted their service regarding this issue. Unfortunately, I was told that this product does not come with extra bars. As a handyman, I went to ACE hardware to buy two couplers and two 2"" bars to extend the legs. At the end, problem's solved, but it cost me additional $6 and my labor to make this product work for my TV."
1,Two Thumbs WAY Down,"This product is horrible. It is flimsy and wobbles, and if you do not get the legs in the back at JUST the right angle, don't be surprised to watch anything placed on it to go flying backwards at any given moment. The whole thing is held in place by double sided tape which will not hold in the front if ANY weight is placed on the back whatsoever. This is an impossible task, and I warn against purchasing this to anyone interested. Buy or build your own sturdy shelf."
4,Good Product,"This shelf is exactly as promised. It is great for a small apartment, extra tv, dorm room, etc. Makes a non-useable space very useable and is expecially nice to keep your program guides or vcr/dvd player on."
3,100 Best Spas of the World,"Good information, but not as much visual content as I would have liked. I expected several quality photographs of the spas, and found only about 10."
4,Julian Day to Gregorian bug clarified,"I'd like to clarify the bug that was reported in an earlier review. The bug is in JD0_to_gregorian. Don't worry, though. You can just use JD0_to_gregorian_proleptic which works just fine! The strange thing is even the comments say the 2 functions are identical. I suggest copying the code of the proleptic version to JD0_to_gregorian because a lot of other functions call into it, such as JD0_to_date. It's odd that just this one function has a bug (and a very pivotal function at that) because everything else seems to work great.Otherwise the book is very complete and has a lot of interesting explanations of different calendars. It even has moon functions, although they are limited to about +/- 100 years from AD 2000 (it says the full versions are too processor intensive). Great book!"
2,Beware the legal conditions,"When I looked at this book, I checked the terms and conditions on using the code, and bascially, those Ts&Cs say ""thou shalt not alter a darn thing in the code"". I think those who attempt to fix bugs in it should be very wary -- the licence as I read it (but I'm not a lawyer) said that you could do nothing with it. And the licence makes it difficult to read it as well -- see for example a search at ... with key words Latham Standard Date, news group comp.std.c, and a date range from say 2000-01-01 to 2002-12-31 will pick up three different threads mentioning this issue."
2,The replacement mirror sent vibrates in housing just like the 1st mirror,"The ""Fit System"" replacement mirror sent to replace the the 1st ""Fit Systems"" mirror still vibrates in the mirror housing at hiway speeds. The vibration is the same on the replacement mirror as the 1st mirror.After talking to a technition at ""fit Systems"" he told me I could make a adjustment on the mirror to tighten the mirror in the housing to eliminate the vibration.This adjustment requires removing the from the car and reinstalling it and I have not had time to do this as yet.My question to ""Fit Systems"" is why they did not ship me a mirror that was correctly adjusted?I am not very happy with this product but I will try to make it work."
1,Not good,"I have all of the bands C/D""s,seeing them live' I have to say this one is the worst one what happen"
4,"A riveting, orginal tale of honor and courage","I picked up ""Shadow"" after thoroughly enjoying Duncan's ""Man of His Word"" series. I was hoping for another good-natured, fun book. What I received was much more: Shadow is the tale of a man who becomes a noble's bodyguard - and takes the title of Shadow. His life becomes inextricably tied to that of his master. (thats the basic synopsis, since there isn't one given).Although there are a few cliched characters in the book, the main cast is a well-rounded bunch that came alive for me. Duncan examines questions of honor and loyalty -- personal loyalty vs. loyalty to the crown -- in the midst of a compelling story.The setting of the world is one of the most unique I have come across in a long time and for that alone I had to go back and reread the novel.All-in-all, I would strongly recommend picking up Shadow -- you won't be dissappointed."
4,Great read,"Fast-paced, well-written story about a degenerate kingdom on a distant planet, colonised in the distant past by humans. A young man named Sald Harl has been called upon to relinquish his identity and become protector of the Prince, henceforth known only as Shadow. In the midst of courtly intrigue, Shadow is forced to journey to another kingdom on his giant eagle-steed, a native of this planet where the only safe way to travel is in the air. What he finds there turns his whole world on its head."
1,odd,"i review science books are part of my job. this is, without question, the strangest book i have yet to encounter."
5,Powered by Pantone,"A very soothing, visual tour-de-force. It's the perfect companion if you want gallery style on a budget. Celebrities step aside, Colorcalm is gonna run a technicolor gamut through your pixelbox."
2,Music in color mood,"A beautiful way to give at the music a color theme and atmosphere to your personal space. 'lso this maybe good for cafe, hotels or metro stations etc."
2,The Chorus has pitch problems,"The orchestra is wonderful, but not so much the chorus, especially the tenors. They are frequently flat and scoop the pitch (slide up to the note). The rest of the chorus performed admirably. If there was another choice out there I would buy it. This DVD was a disappointment."
5,Stripper for cable wire.,If you struggle with repairing the cable on your tv this is the item to buy. It will reduce your frustration level greatly. You know what I mean if you ever tried to repair cable connection.
5,Good stripper.,"Stripper worked great for TV cable and also CAT5. Easy to use, and is adjustable to insure that conductors are not nicked."
2,Hard to figure out how to use it.,I have used it partially and finished the job manually.Insufficient info on how to use it in the package.Checked the company's web site and could not find user friendly infoon how to use this tool.Would not recommend.
3,Must Have for your collection,"This is an awesome CD set, I suggest you get it. I love the songs, but I have them all on other cd's (as most probably do), however.. I think these are classics that no Christian should be without!"
5,The Best Novela Ever!,This novela was one of the best novelas I have ever watched. Especially because it shows how Anahi has grown up in her acting carrier. The role that she played in the novela was a role that fit for her age. She needs to get more novelas were she is making novelas more for the entertaiment of adults and leave behind the teenage life. Lovce it and if anyone want to see a novela where the main character falls in love with two men you will love this one!I cant wait to have it in my hands! =)
5,Great!!!!,I am satisfied with the product and the arrival time was expedient. The product was wrapped in plastic as stated on post. Very satisfied.
3,"Great concept, poor construction.","I kind of bought this out of curiosity because I don't have a naturalistic terrarium, I have a reptibreeze, but since it is the same company I thought I could make it work. NO! I have to send it back. Also, I have a water dragon and it says on the packaging that you don't want to use this with any climbers. Pretending it did fit for my enclosure, I would return it anyways. The bar is plastic and not very durable. It only comes with one fixture, You have to buy the other two separate. In hindsight, I love the look of it, but it seems kind of dangerous afterall.If you have a naturalistic enclosure and a non climing reptile, make sure you get the extra fixtures so you can mount your three bulbs instead of just one. Also, you will have to dissasemble the top if your terrarium to affix this light bar."
3,Good stuff.,"I was expecting a little too much from this DVD I guess.There is very little of David's stand-up (which is CLEARLY stated on the packaging, but still...), although there are some good moments where he gives a few hecklers a piece of his mind.The quality of the video is poor at worst to average at best. The audio isn't great either. It seems as though most of the time they were trying to hide the camera from whoever they were shooting.There is a little story linking the whole DVD together involving David working at this corporation and his boss finds out that he made this DVD... not that funny.David Cross is extremely funny live; this DVD doesn't exactly do him justice."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big David Cross fan but I'm not a blind David Cross fan which means I'm not going to advocate anything he does just because it's him. I own the Mr. Show DVD's and I have his concert CD, so when I received this DVD for Christmas I was very happy.I do want to give credit for his experimentation with something different in the form of a documentary for his concert tour. It was interesting but it just wasn't all that funny. I watched this with two other fans and we were all left feeling like this could have been so much more. It was even hard to watch at points where it came off like a bad episode of ""Insomniac"". It did have its highlights such as the cameos by Mr. Show alums and a scene with a guy who might be the worst interviewer I've ever seen.This DVD comes with a warning that it isn't a stand-up comedy special. Unless you just HAVE to watch all things Cross, I suggest you heed that warning and steer clear of this."
4,Dirty Hippies,"Great Documentary! This is not just his stand up. This is more about Cross traveling the country and interacting with people. Its rednecks and tools haggling him at his own shows and how he handles them. If you like cross than you need to buy this, you will not be disapointed. I promise you that. until a dvd comes out of his live shows this is the next best. If you don't like DAvid Cross, go read a bible!"
2,Mean Spirited,"Don't get me wrong. Stand Up comics and Stand Up comedy crowds are some of the creepiest, and weird groups of people in the world, but this DVD just seems to come across as mean. It's like making fun of very hospitable retarded people, or laughing at my grandmother because she doesn't know who played guitar in the Dead Kennedys.David and his group come across as cliquey jerks laughing at misguided, but ultimately harmless, and often times actually kind of nice, people."
2,Don't bother,"I've been a huge fan of David Cross for years. I own both DVD's of Mr. Show and have even seen his live show a few times.This film was shot on what appears to be an ordinary minicam (which is fine) but it seems like they spent about 1/2 day editing the whole thing...some of the camarework is shaky, the audio is awful in places, etc. Overall, VERY amateurish looking. A real disappointment. Buy Mr. Show instead."
3,Little Rock Sucks!!,"I was a little dissapointed at first, because I thought this was going to be a stand-up concert DVD. But, after giving it a chance and a few beers later I was really getting into it. I love his comedy CDs and Mr. Show, and I thought it was interesting to see what his life was like ""behind the scenes."" He seems like a really cool guy to hang out with, and he seems like he is close with his fans. I also thought it was cool that he played small venues(like bars) instead of concert halls, to make his routine more intimate. And I also loved that a few of the places he performed, I could say ""hey, I was there!!"" This DVD is definately worth renting, and watching once."
2,Expected something else,"Hey,Its not that David Cross isn't funny but watching this DVD is an exercise in frustration as every time you catch a bit from his show it takes you on a doco tangent.I thought I was and would still be willing to buy something which just lets me see the show"
3,Not Bad At All,"Instead of just rehashing his stand-up into DVD format, Cross actually took the time to put together something brand new for his fans.And although it contains very little actual stand-up, LAL somehow manages to capture the vein of his stand-up using the documentary medium. When you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about."
2,I love David Cross but,"this movie was kinda boring. Not enough of Cross' standup. Also when there was footage of his stand up, it wasnt that funny."
1,Why?!,"Okay i'm not biased. I love David Cross. Mr. show. Awesome. His stand up. Pretty damn funny. This dvd sucks. It's totally boring. There's nothing funny on here. It tries to be like Insomniac with Dave Attell, but comes nowhere close. It's sad. It shows just how much of a loser David Cross is when he's not on stage. He reminds me of myself! His life must be as boring as mine! My god I bet even he'd waste his time writing a review for Amazon. And I'm only doing this because I care about you! Don't waste your money! If you want to laugh, buy David Cross's ""shut up you [sex]ing baby!"" CD. It's actually pretty damn funny! If you want to cry, buy this dvd. It just plain sucks! The audio is nearly impossible to understand. The video isn't that great. And you get that feeling at the end. Remember back when you were 13 and you thought masturbation was wrong?! You know that feeling you got every time after you did it?! Well that's how you feel after you watch this video! Okay i'm done."
1,"Pick up your violin, David....","I liked David Cross more when he was the violinist for King Crimson in the 1970's. His comedy pales in comparison to his progressive rock credentials. Hopefully, David will call up Robert Fripp and get it together with Crimson again..."
4,Great indie documentary,"If you've ever hung around with an indie band, a lot of this stuff will seem familiar. Indifferent crowds, lame venues, drunks trying to interrupt the show or staggering up to tell their rambling, incoherent stories after the show, invitations to parties that turn out to be boring or bizarre. A lot of this stuff is a downer, but it's realistic and wry. There are also a few bright spots where he tells a funny story to a receptive crowd, but most of the onstage footage is from when things go seriously wrong, like when an old hippie in the audience farts loudly and the stench drifts onstage. ""Did...did someone just fart? 'Cause it really smells like someone just farted."""
1,Poor audio and video,Very disappointed with video. The audio and video were very poor quality. Had it been taken with a quality camera it could have been a great video.
4,Interesting Brazilian jazz album,"Brazil's much-vaunted Tamba Trio never really wowed me much; too loungey and lightweight, and not very convincing as a jazz band. That being said, this 1974 album is one of their most interesting efforts. While it starts out on an iffy note (with the rock-fusion electric guitar on ""Se E Questao De Adeus Ate Logo"" and the glossy, lightweight fluff of ""Nao Tem Perdao""), it soon turns out to be a surprisingly weird, challenging record. First they shift into some cheesy electronic kitsch (heavy on the synthy keyboards), and finally into spacier, percussion-based avant-jazz, material which would have made Hermeto Pascoal proud. If you'd to find out what these fellows had to offer other than breezy easy listening, then this would be a good album to check out -- it makes the best case for their consideration as a serious jazz band of any of their records that I've heard. Worth checking out!"
3,"A rare personal look at Burroughs, rough, but informative","A rare look at Burroughs, the man, including a hilarious skit of ""By the Dawns Early Light"" starring Burroughs as Dr. Benway. The filming is quite rough, but I think William would have liked it that way. It's worth it just to hear the man speak."
3,Ignore the Technique and Just Enjoy the Author,"Few authors have ever been as adept at oratory with their own writings as Burroughs was, so any record of him reading his work is worth seeing. This also includes some interesting interview segments. It looks cheaply shot, and I could've lived without all the psychedelic effects that the filmmakers put behind Burroughs while he reads; the man is fascinating to listen to and watch, so that stuff is just a distraction. Nonetheless, worth seeing for fans."
2,"It's nice to see Burroughs on film, but...","I was excited to get this DVD and see footage of William. S. Burroughs. Well now I have more than enough clips of the brilliant writer, but that's about it. Not really a biography. Not really a movie. Just some cool footage that would go well in the background at a party where the abstract musical musings of the band Anamorphosis are improvising live, and you watch Burroughs cut ups while trying to slide closer to the cute girl dressed as a Japanese anime character...before passing out from too much faux absinthe a guy dressed as Hunter.S.Thompson gave you at the door of the same guys living room.Good footage. No content."
1,not very good,"its not that comfortable, the massage is only in one spot and the device inside the cushion for massaging sticks out too much so that if u want to use this without the massage feature on it is uncomfortable to use on ur back. overall i regret this purchase."
2,ahhh so and soo,"the vibrator is nice, its pretty strong.. but the position you sit while sitting back on this chair is quite uncomfortable."
2,Back rest not so restful,"I was disappointed with how uncomfortable this back rest is. I am shorter and the back rest curvature is not very flexible or fitting to someone of my height. For me, it was a waste of a lot of money."
2,"Looks pretty, very uncomfortable","I wanted something so I could relax and read in bed before I went to sleep. This is not the thing if that's what you want to do. It is too upright and you can't change the angle to recline. The cup holder is in the perfect place for an elbow if you want a hard plastic object under your elbow while you're trying to read. I was really surprised at the hard lump in the lower back area that's supposed to be a massager. It is so close to the surface and so hard it feels like a rolling pin being jabbed into my back. It is pretty, just basically unusable for relaxing."
3,It's ok...,"This product is ok...not great. The cup holder is not really useable because the arm rests are too short. That's something you won't get from the photo. And returns are prohibited because of some sanitation concerns, supposedly. (Although most retail stores allow clothing to be tried on or even returned....) I haven't used the battery operated massager because I'm not really in to that. It's the proper balance between softness and stiffness for me. I sometimes put a pillow at the bottom of the back rest so I can lean back a little more and still have lower back support."
3,It's okay,"This backrest is made of nice firm material, and covered with a nice faux suede fabric. It seems pretty high quality, should be fairly durable. It's nice how it folds up -- although even folded, it's still a bulky item.I found that the backrest was too ""upright"" for my taste. It might be perfect for doing paperwork, working on a laptop, breakfast in bed, etc. But just for bedtime reading, I prefer reclining to sitting. This bedrest doesn't really allow reclining. The uprightness is emphasized in my situation since we have a really soft bed (waveless waterbed), so sitting upright I kind of sink into the bed but the backrest does not.The massager provides a vibrating massage in the lower back area. I really need a firm kneading massage in the neck/shoulder area, so it doesn't do much for me. But it might be just right for others."
2,So-so at best.,"I'm trying to be objective and review this item fairly. It looked bigger in the picture and while there may have been dimensions listed, It was hard to tell. What I mean by this is... I am an average size man (5'11"")... the cupholder ends up being located directly under my forearm... not realistic to use in that location. The arms are short... maybe 12 inches and lastly the ""headrest"" does a wonderful job supporting my upperback and maybe a little of my neck. The vibrating massage ""mechanism"" is hard and uncomfortable against my lower back... in the on or off position. It is made of good quality material.All in all it would probably be great for someone who is 5'2"" or smaller... it's more child-size.Sorry HoMedics... I wanted to give you a good review... I really did."
2,HOMEDICS MESSAGING BACK REST,I was sure my daughter could use this with a new baby to feed and the cup holder to hold a warm bottle. I thought this would even be a good idea for me to do some paperwork in bed and message my tired back. The joke was on us. This product is very well made but the arms are to short. The cup holder is a great for resting your elbow. I am 5 foot 7 and my daughter is 5 foot 5. This is made for a very small person. The back head rest is too short. It fits the lower part of the neck at the shoulders. I wish this came in sizes. The men in the family just laugh. It would never work for them. The workmanship is great.
4,Nice Back Rest,"This Back Rest has a nice, neutral color and the fabric is nice as well. I particularly like that I can fold it so it doesn't take up much space when not in use. I haven't used the massager so I can't say much about that, but the seat itself provides good upright support. Overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase and would recommend the product."
2,Expensive back rest,"I had hoped that I could use this while reading. It sits too upright for comfortable reading in bed (you could put a pillow on it to rectify this, but then it negates what massage you may get). The massage part is pretty non-existent and you cannot plug it in, so stock up on D batteries. I already had a back support pillow but hoped the massage part on this one would do something. Do not buy this unless you need upright support and don't mind spending money for a massager that does nothing."
3,good except for cupholder,I like the back rest allot except for the cup holder on the arm I use it to crochet and rest my arms on the armrests and it is uncomfortable where my arm lies against the cupholder but other than that it is working out fairly well
2,Not if you are looking for a massage.,"This chair is okay for leaning against in bed, but even then I needed a pillow behind me. The hard metal vibrator just under the thin material stuck right in the middle of my back. It hurt me the first time I leaned back because I wasn't expecting something hard. This back rest has a very small vibrating mechanism in it that doesn't really travel the whole back.The height was okay for me since I am only 5'3.There is no way to control the intesity of the vibration. It is either on or off.I took mine back the next day. The metal object in the backrest definately did not sooth my aching back."
2,color too faded,"The sound is good. The story and music are good. But, the picture quality is very poor and extremely faded. Darkening the picture didn`t help much. Not a good buy for the price. My copy had the same VHS picture and was issued by an unknown company, so I presume this VHS is the same."
1,Very Basic Book,As a high tech major I had to buy this book for one of my classes. Horrible book. So basic I do not even know why they made it. Should be called Computer Basics 101.
1,I Don't Understand the Author's Motivation?,It is quite clear that the author has issues with orthodoxy. This book is in no way an accurate account of hasidic women in Israel. The book's biased view is quite clear throughout.I do not recommend it!
3,work light,"these things are larger than they appear in the picture. And heavy. But they work ok. Oh yea, they get very warm. If you are looking for something to squeeze into a tight spot, this may not work for you."
5,Completely surprised,"Kate visited our church in San Antonio early this year. I had never heard of her before, but sat quitely at she plugged in her guitar and started to play. And play she did...What I heard in her ""Melissa Ethridge"" style of music completely blew me away. She sang ""Carry Me"" and by the end of the song I was on my feet wanting to hear more. As a classic rocker from the 60's & 70's era, it's really great to hear some inspirational messages with a beat that makes you tap your toes, bounce your head and say YEAH!"
2,Bad product,"I purchased this to rid my basement of creepy crawly things. After purchasing this unit (which is very loud when on), I see no noticable difference in the creepy crawly things in my basement."
3,Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc,"re the review in which writer said he noticed 30 or 40 dead insects. That could only have been a coincidence. This product claims to REPEL, not to kill, insects et al!! Don't know if it works, as just got one today. Read somewhere that certain rodents get used to the ultrasonic sounds, and come back. (assuming it chased them away, which is something I'll have to wait to find out).Hmm...."
4,A great aid to the procrastinating bride-to-be!,"The practical guidance in this book helped me create the wedding of my dreams in just a few months. I recommend it highly! Regardless of how much time and money you have, it is possible to create a wonderful wedding. This book can help you get there."
1,Not really interesting....,"Random, pointless, and angry. The story had so much potential and let me down in just about every way. I bought this book because of all the good reviews I've seen of it, and the story seemed interesting, but there isn't a whole lot to it. The art was different in a good way, but the plot was non-existent."
5,"Finally, an album that my many facets can appreciate","As an Irish dancer, and a mom to two Irish dancers, I am always on the lookout for anything cool that is Irish. Accordians and flutes can get old after a while, and the kids like more upbeat music.As a retired punk, I can really get into the music. The energy is just incredible. While the cd can't capture the energy of the show, it is still a fun cd to listen to.Now, to explain to my 10 year old why he can't get a fake id. If only they would play an all ages venue out here."
5,another great one,"Another ripper from F-Molly. I wasn't sure if ""Drunken Lullabies"" would stand up to the greatness of ""Swagger"" but it does and then some. There are few bands that can approach the power of the Pogues but these guys are coming damn close. Try to catch em live. They absolutely smoke."
1,Let's be generically Irish!,"I'm Irish, I'm not a drunk, I don't like bouncy jumpy music with ""Irish"" instruments thrown in. This is a joke, I'm surprised there isn't a leprechaun on the cover."
2,Unremarkable,"This is a cd that lost credit with me over time. Being massively into Irish culture I picked it up because of it's style but I found with repeat listening it was a lot of the same old stuff. Every song sounds like the following and the previous. What's wrong with this album seems to me to be an affliction that much popular punk music suffers from these days. Oversimplified drumbeats and a lack of any originality make it tough to listen to it over and over again.It's obvious that Floggin Molly owes a debt to The Pogues, but they fail to capture the originality and musicality of those they emulate. While this album can be fun to listen to, and is frenetic (it keeps me awake on long road trips) it is not musically astounding. I enjoy listening to it sometimes, but only for its simplicity and pace."
1,ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!,"Well, this sucked I must say. There was no.... emotion. No depth. Far better records have been released than this.Now, let's look for something with passion, with spirit, an independent flame in the music industry. Let's look for:The Tweenies Greatest Hits.Now THAT'S classy music."
3,Vinyl a little warped,When I received the brand new vinyl in the mail it was already slightly warped. When it spins you can see it bowing up as it rotates. Sounds good though.
5,"Q: How do you avoid the ""sophomore slump""?","A: Put out a great record that surpasses your previous effort.Flogging Molly has certainly done it with this album. While ""Swagger"" was full of some great, rollicking cuts, ""Drunken Lullabies"" showcases the band's abilities as they stretch their sound into new musical territory. Longtime fans will be happy to know that ""Swagger"" and ""If I Ever Leave This World Alive"" have finally made it onto this album. Dave King's songwriting has come further since their debut, and positively shines in the beautiful ""Death Valley Queen."" Other songs of note include ""Another Bag of Bricks,"" reminiscent of the Pogues' ""Turkish Song of the Damned"" and the fastest cover of ""The Rare Ould Times"" you'll hear anywhere."
5,"Please, not the Pogues...","No, they aren't the Pogues. Nor should they be compared. Fact is, this band is good NOW. The Pogues were sounding a bit worn by the end... and one could say they sounded like a few well known traditional Irish bands of the day. FM has a great sound, fantastic lyrics, and I can't wait to see them live some time if they ever make it within 50 miles of my home. I'm 39, loved the Pogues, still do, and stubled onto FM while looking for something other than old Pogues cds to listen to. Thank god I found these guys and the Real McKenzies."
5,"I'm Mad Bess Bonney, pirate in Flogging Molly's army","In case you didn't know, if ur a fan of Flogging Molly you are referred to as a pirate of their army. Just so you know I'm not fully insane.I own all 3 yes 3 not 2 cds of Flogging Molly's and have seen them live. They always rocked and always will. Even my Guidance Councelor a man of like 50 with shoulder length white hair likes em!And i must address this bunch of bull about Swagger being better than Drunken Lullibies. THEY'RE BOTH GREAT! People, did you know that they wrote these songs all at the same time? Before the cds? DO you people LOVE to hate sophemore albums or something?Flogging Molly rules, I've met them, they are nice. And there is no way their sound can be copied again. (they're idol band is the Pouges)By the way in case you're curious, their third cd is a live cd, called ""Alive Behind the Green Door"" it kicks.Later Irish ones....(IRISH PEOPLE FOREVER!!!! I'M INSANE!!!!!)"
5,just amazing,"Wow. I know people have said this about a billion times, but this album makes me wish I was Irish. Just the whole feeling you get listening to it...whoa. I'm normally into metal and I only like a handful of punk bands but Flogging Molly may very well get me more into the punk movement with this album. The opening song ""Drunken Lullabies"" starts the album off with a bang that continues through ""Kilburn High Road"" and others, and lasts until the very end. I do not believe there is a single bad song on this album. I think I want to go pack my bags and move to Dublin...cheers!!!"
5,What more can you ask for?,"man, when i was intoduced to this band a few years ago, it was amazing. From the moment that my friend played the first song on this album, i was hooked. This album starts off with a great song that gets you into high spirts. And the whole album is awesome. If you havent bought this album yet, and you are a fan of bands like dropkick muphys and such, then i expect you to pick this one up."
4,Punk With a Shot of Bailey's Irish Creme,"An Irish punk band from California? Flogging Molly had to convince skeptics that they were actually, you know, Irish on their first album Swagger- which features a seven-minute song called ""Black Friday Rule"" that explains exactly how they ended up in California. But by Drunken Lullabies, Flogging Molly had firmly established themselves and developed their signature sound- a mix of guitars, Irish fiddle, and accordion. They rock hardest on the faster songs- ""Drunken Lullabies,"" ""What's Left of the Flag,"" ""May The Living Be Dead In Our Wake,"" ""Kilburn High Road,"" and ""Swagger""- but close out the album with the lovely acoustic ""The Sun Never Shines (On Closed Doors)."" Midtempo songs like ""Death Valley Queen"" and ""Another Bag of Bricks"" never really get off the ground, and sound like filler between the album's roaring start and its soft, understated conclusion."
5,Toast to you Flogging Molly,"I wasn't sure how Drunken Lullabies would turn out, considering FM's last two CD's were so good. Normally bands that rock so well live, put out boring CD's. Let me tell you that Drunken Lullabies is full of foot stomping, jamming, sing along tunes that anyone with a sense of rock music would love. I've seen these guys live in the Casbah in San Diego and the Laga Lounge in Pittsburgh, this CD serves them well. Buy it! Support Flogging Molly!"
4,"Very good band, but wrongfully categorized.","This is a very good cd. Flogging Molly, a group similar to Dropkick Murphys, the Real Mckenzies, and The Tossers is NOT what you guys are saying ""Celtic Punk."" There's no such thing. It's Boston Irish Punk. Keep in mind they're not directly from Ireland."
5,Good DVD to learn the basics.,I think some of the reviews are a bit harsh. This is an excellent DVD for the beginner. It will help you learn the fundamentals. Without that you cannot survive in the game. If you are an intermediate or advanced player skip this one.
3,Beginners only.,"If your a fan of the WPT and listen and learn from the commentary, you have already heard what this DVD has to say."
3,Good DVD,"This DVD is full of information that would best help someone at the beginer-intermediate stage of their poker carer. It goes through some basic stratagies of betting before and after the flop, turn, and river.It also briefly talks about spotting tells and calculating odds.But by far the best part about it, and what I found to be the most helpfull, is the freflop stratagy chart, where it breaks down what hands to play preflop and how to play them.It doesn't, however, get into good detail during certain parts of the DVD such as post flop betting or ""sizing up your opponent"" like it says on the back of the DVD.But if you are just startting, or just looking for some advise from a great poker player, I think this DVD is worth your time."
4,Where is part 2?,"This video was good, for starters. I think I need to purchase the next video he comes out with, hopefully with more ""meat.""The best part of this video was the included chart for opening hands and what you should do with respect to your position, and why.He does take too long to get to the point at times, but this is because he is talking from the heart, not cue cards. He means well, and is very sincere.I have only been playing poker about a month, and I did gain some insight into the way the game is played. Howard teaches you to be a very tight-agressive player which helps you out in the long run (as he states) because you won't be faced with post-flop headaches.This video would be a 5 star affair only if it contained at least one ""Secret."" But most novices who are ignorant of the basics would consider them secrets."
2,"""Elements"" NOT ""Secrets"" of No Limit Hold'em","For me personally, this DVD was a disappointment. I purchased it, watched it once and then resold it on E-Bay to get my money back.The use of the word ""secrets"" in the title is clearly a marketing ploy. There are no secrets to be learned here! The DVD contains nothing but the most basic elements of how to play no limit hold'em.A large section of the DVD is also ""wasted"" with a lengthy and, in my opinion, uneeded tutorial on how to run your own no limit hold'em tournaments at home.More substantive strategic game information in place of this ""filler material"" would have been greatly appreciated.I can only recommend this DVD for the ""rank"" beginner with no or very little knowledge of the game - especially the type of person who has just recently discovered poker as a result of the current poker boom on television and the Internet.Long-time cash game and tournament poker players will not learn anything in the least bit ""secretive"" here."
3,Not too bad,"This DVD is helpful for beginning players, but is too tight and predictable to be used by itself. I would also recommend reading a book on Hold 'Em from Sklansky's library or playing hands on a free money poker site before viewing this video. It's for beginners, but not for those with no experience at all. Some things are done very well, but others are pointless fillers. Worth checking out for cheap, but don't put all your chips in on this one."
1,Secrets of how to make a crappy poker video,"Howard Lederer borrowed a 1994 model camera to make this video and shot in his basement with no budget, no lighting, and no script. I'm thinking about making my own poker video, it apparently isn't hard.Howard Lederer may be a world class poker player, but he is as boring as a dial tone. 90% of what you learn in this video you learn in the intro to Texas Hold 'Em you see in the WSOP intro or the WPT into to the game. I'm incredibly glad I didn't buy this DVD. My friend wasted money on this video. If you're smart, you won't waste your money either."
2,thanks for patronizing...,"The sub-title reads ""The Ultimate Guide to No-Limit Holdem"". It is hardly an ultimate guide. It is a beginner's guide at best and that's if you live ina cave and don't watch televised poker. Televised poker gives you a primer on the game nearly every broadcast and good commentary to fill in the gaps. Even Lederer as an analyst/ commentator is more helpful than this DVD; I think the main problem here is the target audience is expected to be almost completely ignorant and so it feels a bit too elementary. If you are completely new to holdem it is probably okay otherwise it feels a little patronizing. Consider renting as once you understand the basics you probably won't rewatch it."

5,Great short films from worldwide.,"If you are looking for quality short films from worldwide, 'Short' dvd series definitely is the one to go for. 'Short 8: Vision', the 8th dvd from the 'Short' dvd series, has optimized the usage of dvd format as previous issues, providing commentaries, behind-the-sense, production notes of the films which will let viewers have further understanding on the flim makers' concept behind their works. Compare with previous issues, 'Vision' also has better menu navigation."
3,Original B Movie,"If you're the type that only likes polished, higher budget horror, stay away. However, if you can look beyond the typical flaws of ""B"" horror, this movie is worth a watch. Dougie is a young, confused boy obsessed with the video game ""Satan's Little Helper"". On Halloween day, Dougie meets up with a serial killer wearing a mask who Dougie thinks is the real Satan from the video game. They become instant friends, and Dougie's innocence doesn't allow him to see the climbing body count as they go on a rampage through the town. For the most part, the killings aren't very gory or bloody, but there is one scene involving a black cat that will shock the squeamish and make others laugh out loud. I have to give 3 stars for the original storyline and several funny moments. The ""B"" stats: kung fu, cat fu, drain-o fu, and shopping cart-vs-pregnant-woman fu. One panty-sniffing Prince of Darkness. Four breasts (two scenes involving the same nekkid lady). Three stars."
2,a satan's little dumb boy !!,A naive young boy uknowingly becomes the pawn of a serial killer.it has good start but the end is a miserable !
4,"Fun, Fun, movie","The movie is about an escaped convict dressed up as satan, during a Halloween night. Luckily he meets up with an ugly naive kid who believes he is Satan and wants to be ""Satan's little helper.The movie was fun, it had a good gore scene, but the acting wasn't good. Amanda Plummer was in it-- that helps. The camera work was good, but it looked like it was shot on a cam corder.The director (who also did Squirm) did a remarkable job with the movie, and he also wrote it.I recommend it to people who like fun and cheesy movies."
1,This movie sucked!,"I caught this flick on TV last night and I was quite intrigued. Well, curiosity killed THIS cat because this movie SUCKED! It started out promising but by the end of the movie I had a huge headache thanks to the boring plot, really slow pacing, and the implausible story. Who knew a serial killer movie could be such a snooze? Rent the original Halloween and leave this one in the DVD dust bin."
1,The entire premise of this movie was just not ok,"I am one of those people who it is really hard to offend and I normally enjoy the obscene and offensive, but this movie just took things way too far."
2,Movie Review,"Satan's ""costume"" or make up didn't look realistic. I was a little disappointed because I don't like movies in which people kill other people. I prefer to see supernatural forces doing all the destruction. Only watch this movie if you have run out of movies to watch and you don't feel like reading a book or going out."
1,Absolutely worthless,"I bought this movie 3 days ago encouraged by what was on cover and reviews I had read about it, it sounded good, boy was I in for a surprise.Firstly the movie in my opinion is sick not funny as they stated it was. It was confusing, and stupid. If anyone thinks it is funny to take a cat and smash its head into a wall then rub the blood all over said wall, then we live with a lot of sick people. I would not recommend this movie, I am not an animal activist there was not call for this scene. The plot was twisted and sick giving people ideas on how to do damage to children. No wonder we have had to change the way we give out Halloween candy. This is one movie that should never have been made. It was just death for no reason and definitely not funny in any way shape or form. If I had known then what I know now I would never have spent even 1cent for it."
3,Funny little horror flick,"Well, this movie is a low budget film, BUT it has some gore, good kills, a funny twist, and some good Halloween fun in it. I've seen some BAD movies and this wasn't that bad at all. I actually liked it. It made me laugh, say ewwwww, and surprised me too. It's certainly worth the 5.00 price tag here. I was amused and pretty pleased. Then again, I REALLY have a thing for Halloween."
3,Annoying Characters,"I purchased this movie because while I was out of town on a business trip I caught part of the movie in the hotel room one night. It seemed very interesting at the time but as I said I only caught part of the movie and wasn't sure what was going on. After watching the full length movie I was a little disappointed, mainly with how annoying the characters were, the little boy and his sister just got on my nerves at how dumb they were.In the end though I tried my best to look past the character flaws and found myself somewhat enjoying the movie. It might make a good movie to watch during Halloween season but don't expect too much."
2,SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER DVD 1.5 / 5,Obviously the movie was bad but the viewer has to admit that it was a new idea for a horror film. A kid walking around with Satan disguised in a Halloween wardrobe. I don't no if this movie is suppose to be serious or funny but I had a couple of laughs.
4,Oddly-Paced Indie Flick Heads Above the Usual Straight-to-video Dreck,"If you can get past the distractingly stupid kid (just tell yourself he's got special needs), this oddly-paced indie flick is heads above the usual straight-to-video Halloween horror dreck. Theres a decent body count, a few genuinely creepy moments (that Jesus mask is pure nightmare fuel!), and enough self-deprecating humor to keep the less-than-subtle message from being too self-consciously preachy. Poor kitty..."
3,Interesting Premise - Tough Read,"Ashe prepared an interesting premise outlining his long quest to find the ""historical"" King Arthur. His theory leads the reader back through time in looking at the history of the Britians, or Bretons. End of the day, his theory of a 5th Century basis for Arthur. The challenge is that the book drags along for page after page, and never really gets to a climax or a crescendo, Instead, it is a relatively non-academic treatise, and one that neither satisfies the scholar or the casual reader. Someone deeply interested in Arthur may find this to be a five star read, but for the casual reader, it's kind of a slog."
1,OBSOLETE - NO FILM AVAILABLE,"I liked this camera when I had one. I just ran across it in a box today. But film hasn't been made for it since 2006, and the one cartridge of film I had (from probably 2003) was completely stale. If you buy this camera, don't expect to find film for it. Film on ebay goes for $10/cartridge, and it's all at least 5 years old.Why doesn't Amazon take this kind of stuff down? If you want to buy old junk, go to ebay."
4,Great Gifts for the Needy,"I've been told by others who've used it for the purpose, overseas, that the little photos produced by these cameras are a wonderful and much-appreciated gift that produces a LOT of excitement in the kids in India and elsewhere who are in so much need that they're begging from tourists, but who are often being abused and exploited in order to make money for others. This is a gift for THEM; sometimes they'll have no other photo of themselves other than what you just took for them to keep for themselves or give to someone who cares about them. What a great idea ... I'm buying one for my upcoming trip. Something of lasting value; better than candy or money."
3,"Occasionally, it is very useful.","This is fun to use because you can stick it on a magnet to put in on the fridge or just about anywhere you like. However, the film is costly. It's better to buy the films 4 in a pack because it's less cost."
4,Perfect for parties,"I purchased the camera as a gift to my sister and she loved it - it was a load of fun. There are 2 things to be careful of, however. First, the film is expensive. Not all film is ""sticky"" film and you pay a lot for the 12 exposures you get. Second, the sticky part of the film needs to be improved...it will stick to clothing and other items, but it just doesn't feel like it will...hard to describe. To the touch, the bond does not feel strong. But its a lot of fun."
4,You get what you pay for,"I must admit this is a very novel idea. I love my camera (I got the clear blue one, I forgot the fancy name). Anyways here are the problems. 1) The on/off/flash wheel is very loose. On many occasions I have had it turn on to the ready flash mode and a few hours later my batteries were gone. This is a real concern as anything will turn them on, even the shuffling of your clothes while it's sitting in your drawer. 2) The pictures are very small so take this into account. If you take a picture with a dozen people, they all come out to be the size of dots. 3) Take pictures REALLY up close not far away. Good luck making out someone on stage at a concert.If used correctly, you will love this camera. Enjoy it but don't expect anything special out of a $20 camera."
4,Great Camera,"I like the I-Zone camera a lot- it's small, lightweight, and really fun to use because the pictures are so creative and (with the sticky film) you can put them anywhere. Also, when you take the picture, you can set the camera for indoors, outside- cloudy, or outside- sunny and it automatically adjusts the flash. I took off one star for a few things. One, like everyone else said, the flash button is pretty loose. Two, I don't like having a border on the picture- you can only trim it so much. And finally, Polaroid doesn't make a case for it, which is kind of a pain. But otherwise it's a great camera and I'd recommend it!"
1,Too Small!,The pictures are about the size of a postage stamp! They should include a big magnifying glass with the camera!
5,SOO COOL!,"This camera is soo cool! It is small and easy to fit in a pocket, and It takes great pictures. I absolutly love this camera!"
1,on line shopping,"I only gave it a one star , because I was told it was available, but now they say two weeks. I always thought if something was available it was on hand. Well back to the store if I want it for Christmas."
2,Film never turns out,"I have bought 2 rolls of I-zone sticky film and only one picture has turned out at all. The rest are pitch black. The one picture was sort of neat of my cat, but other than that I seriously do NOT reccomend this product"
1,Doesn't Work At All,It is the worst. I have tried many different things to get it to work but all that shows up is a brown screen. It doesnt take my pictures. I even baught a new set of film and it doesn't work. Does anyone possibly know why?
3,Cool,"I was really excited when i got my I-zone in the mail, But i thought it came with film- big dissapointment. make sure you have the film ready when it comes, cause now im broke and sad :("
5,Great camera!,"I have the silver adition of the i zone camera and its neat.I waisted about 3 out of 17 pictures but now i am pretty good.It takes a little getting used to, but i think its a great camera.It is actually the first camera i ever had of my own besides a disposable camera! I love it and the pics are sticky.Yeah!"
2,a clever idea but poorly executed,"Obviously, this camera looks cool. It's simple to use and very straight forward when it comes to taking pictures. The problem is: they never come out looking very good. Mistakes are costly too as the film comes in packs of six! The pictures are awkward in size and Polaroid recommends that you don't trim them due to the presence of CAUSTIC glue. I like Polaroid's new approach, this could have been a very cool device but instead I think I'll stick to more conventional cameras."
3,So-so notes,"These are some of the worst cliff notes I have ever come across. The summaries/commentaries are long. This is still a must if you are reading the awakening, but they are not well written for someone who wants a brief summary of what is going on in this book.If you do get this book, don't forget to read the real book, as you are missing out on good literature and cliffs' notes don't cover everything in the original book..."
3,Great tool,This was a great book. I enjoyed it and also purchased one as a gift for a friend. I would reccommend it.
3,Giant Schnauzers by Joe Stahlkuppe,I have lots of pix of my show dogs with natural ears. http://www.bestinshow.net/dogs/magnakennel.html Nice book. Better than most.
3,Good but not the best,Only buy if die hard fan. This are recordings from teenage Wilson. So buy at own risk. Dont waste your money.
3,Only one good song,I gave one star plus to my rate beacause of the radioactive toy song which is a great song . The rest album is really boring and bad. only for collectors
4,My outlook on On theSunday of Life,Some of the songs on here I have heard from Compilation Albums. Songs like Lynton Samuel Dawson is almost comical. It gives me a laugh which is a good thing. On the sunday of life is a beautiful song. I have always loved And the swallows dance above the sun. I believe its Space Transmission that I am thinking of but it gives off a sort of eerie feeling. It may not be their greatest work ever but it is definitely compelling in nature.
4,The first glimpse of genius...,"This CD is a compilation of two ""tongue in cheeks"" tapes made by Steven Wilson at the end of the 80s (he plays all instruments here). So, it is NOT a true album, but just a glimpse of all the good things to come. Do not judge this work too harshly, this is essentially for ""informed"" fans, not beginners.Anyway, even at that stage of his career, Steven Wilson was already a genius."
4,Mi ultimo álbum de PT,"Digo que es mi ultimo álbum porque ya conseguí todos los posteriores en el termino de un año, el primero que oí fue Fear of a blank planet, este disco encendió mi curiosidad llevándome por un viaje de conocimiento y placer al encontrar cada nueva placa (para mi).esta placa no es la excepción la disfrute tanto como cualquier otra de PT . Podría hacer comparaciones con cualquier grupo de la década del 60-70 pero seria injusto, el brillo de PT esta en sus letras que tienen actualidad, son de hoy. Se que entraron en la psicodelia burlándose de ella pero comprendieron que había algo mas para decir y la actualizaron. Esta placa hace notar esa burla y también resalta que la psicodelia no solo esta ligada al LSD, hay otras drogas y adicciones(cualquier cosa que podamos consumir y temer) que consumimos como sociedad y nos van cambiando y nos afectan. En esta placa PT nos grita esto."
2,For completists only,"Man, I love pretty much everything PT and SW have done, but this is a tough listen. The music is OK I guess, very dated sounding both production and composition wise, but the vocals and lyrics man, they take the cake. Half the time Steven sounds like a robot, the rest of the time he sounds effeminate. I won't get too into the lyrics but you really wonder sometimes just what he was trying to get across. The whole thing sounds like a rock opera about someone from another planet who is confused about their sexuality and identity. Fair enough, but the problem here is it sounds like it was written by a junior High School student. This is worth listening to once, if only to hear how far Steven Wilson's talents have evolved. Like I said, for completists only."
2,Eh,This is the worst PT album I've heard (which means it's still fairly decent..) a few nice songs here and there but the album as a whole is plain and boring..
1,ILOVEPTBUT.,"I'M SORRY.I LOVE PT BUT THIS IS NOT MY CUP OF TEA.THE MUSIC THAT THEY ARE PUTTING OUT NOWADAYS(SIGNIFY,SKY MOVES SIDEWAYS,ABSENTIA,COMA)IS AWESOME.IF YOU LIKE KING CRIMSON YOU MAY LIKE THE EARLIER STUFF,IF YOU DON'T YOU MIGHT START WITH SIGNIFY AND WORK YOUR WAY UP.LIKE I SAID I LOVE PT.THEY'RE MY FAVORITE BAND .THEY KNOW HOW TO ROCK."
1,WONDER WHAT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT,"BOUGHT THE CD AND REGRETED IT EVER SINCE.MY WIFE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS CRAZY.WHAT IS THAT?,SHE SAID.I DON'T KNOW I SAID AS I CRUISED THREW ALL THE TRACKS.I LOVE PT BUT THIS IS LIKE NOTHING & I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEY HAVE OUT NOW.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS ONE......"
5,Ultimate Bread Knife,"My identical knife, after many years, had worn smooth.This one is just like it, perfect for slicing bread ortomatoes. Rated highly by Cook's Illustrated."
5,Great knife,This knife was recommended by Cook's Illustrated. It is very sharp and works great. It might be a little large for cutting smaller items.
5,It is so nice to have the right tool for the job,As always the Victorinox Fibrox knives are well made. I started baking artisan breads and needed a better knife for slicing. The wavy bread knife fills the bill.
4,Great bread knife,"This knife slices through bread like it's hot butter. Only reason I gave it four stars is because it's a bit heavy, and also seems to hew to the left a little while slicing something of a denser texture. Still we're happy to have it."
5,A very good Bread Knife,I make bread at home very often and needed a good knife as the normal vegetable knife does not work great for this purpose. I am very glad to have purchased this knife. It works like a charm.
4,wrong kind of sharp,"Hrm, I dunno. This knife is CRAZY sharp, so sharp that I frequently cut myself just brushing my finger against it. But that's not what a bread knife is supposed to be... it's supposed to be ""hacksaw sharp"" not ""razor sharp"".In short, this knife needs grittier teeth and a duller edge. It's not supposed to be a surgical implement."
5,Great Bread Knife,I highly recommend this bread knife.It works very well with the big loaves of gluten-free crusty French bread I make in regular loaf pans for regular size sandwich bread.
5,"Great, high quality item.","We bought our first of these knives in a little village fair in Switzerland in the fall of 1969. They are wonderful and ours is used for everything in the kitchen, everyday. Over the years, we've bought many more, as gifts for our family and friends. Highly recommend this item."
3,OKAY bread knife,"This knife is just OKAY - nothing special. I started baking my own artisan bread at home so I needed a much better bread knife to get through the crust. I bought this because of the great reviews, but I'm not that happy with this knife. It will cut through my bread, but not as easily as I would like (I don't think this blade is sharp enough). I wish I would have just spent the extra money to buy Wusthof knife. That's what I'll get next..."
4,About the best bread knife for the money,"What can i say, for the price i can't imagine getting a better knife, i would def get again (though I am thinking this knife will last quite a while)"
5,A great bread knife!,"I've just returned to baking bread on a regular basis. I have three or four bread knives, but none have allowed me to slice cleanly and accurately... until now. This slicing knife is amazing. I can cut through all types of bread, making thin slices without tearing. Furthermore, this knife is a great value. I couldn't be happier with the purchase."
4,Gets the job done,"I have had this knife for more than a year and it is still as sharp as it was the day it arrived. It has just the right amount of heft. It's not so light that it feels inadequate in the hand nor so heavy that using it becomes a chore. The one very minor crticism that I can offer is that I do not find the knife aesthetically pleasing. It has no style, nothing that would draw the eye to it. But that point aside, it does its job very well."
5,Works very well,Would buy again if necessary. Seems to be very long lasting and works well on bread as well as cutting cookie dough slices.
5,Bomb-diggity,This knife is THE best knife I have ever purchased. This knife is the best bread cutting knife ever. Just be warned that it does cut the sleeve it is shipped in very easily because it is that sharp. I plan on purchasing more knives. Who else better to make knives then the Swiss Army Company.
5,Love it,"Great knife, good price. Have only had it a few weeks but so far seems like it'll be my favorite, I'll be using it a lot. Really sharp, cuts very well."
4,"Great knife, but huge.","It's great for the reasons others mention. But be forwarned that this knife is huge. It's 15 inches long in total - more than my big 10-inch chef's knife. Most standard knife blocks have only one slot that would hold a knife this big, and that's the slot for your big chef's knife.My wife says this knife is way too big for her. She much prefers the Good Grips bread knife.OXO Good Grips 8"" Bread Knife"
4,Sharpest knife in the drawer,"I bought this knife to replace a much-loved bread knife whose wooden handle had gotten dried and cracked. Wow! I hadn't realized how dull my old knife was until I used this one the first time. The bandaid on my finger attests to the keenness of the edge: on the very first draw through my morning bagel, it sliced as much as my old knife would have done in 3 draws, and reminded me that there is a correct slicing technique.Great knife! Handle with care."
5,This knife rocks,"I make a lot of bread and I have a few other bread knives. This one became my instant favorite the first time I used it, and it has remained my favorite after many uses. And the price is very reasonable for the incredible performance."
5,Works great,"I purchased the knife for my son, and he said it works great. It seems to have a solid construction - it was a good purchase."
5,fantastic,Works so good that I bought another one for a friend of mine; a retired butcher. He uses it regularly whenever he has meat to slice. A word of warning: KEEP IT AWAY FROM BONES.
5,I would give 7 stars if I could,"Absolutely love this knife. It does the job 200%. By the time you're done cutting one loaf of bread, you'll bake another bread just so you can use this knife again. Really. No joke. I would give seven stars on this one if I could.."
5,Great part !!!,"A very good price on a much needed part. Just the same as going to the ""warehouse"" stores only much less expensive."
5,The Big Red Cat says...buy this DVD,"Finally Comedy Central has the heart to release this brilliant show for all the UCB junkies like myself who have been fiending for intelligent comedy. Every episode is hillarious- ""Little Donny"" and ""Bucket of Truth"" are definately two of the best ones. A must have and I am already waiting for the next set to be released, but until then, I'm gonna kick back, enjoy, and keep looking for tickets to see the Titte Brothers...."
5,"After reading the fortune cookie, add in bed at the end!","I have not bought this DVD yet, but i have anticipated this day for way too long. I loved this show so much and i told so many people about it. I was surprised to find that not many people had even heard about this show. I told them some of the funny sketches, but I could not bring it to life for the people. I think that my favorite scene would have to be the one where the couples are eating fortune cookies, and lets just say...one guy gets very unlucky with his cookies. I was wondering if anyone knew if that scene was in the first season or not. Regardless, i will end up getting all the seasons if they come out(knock on wood)."
2,Ce n'est pas Mr. Show,"Each episode is just good enough to make me want to watch the next one. There are occasional glimmers of brilliance, but most of it falls short. Comparisons to Mr. Show are unwarranted; UCB has none of the originality or subtlety. Like SNL in the last ten years, half of the jokes fail to reach their potential and the other half lack any potential to begin with. On the positive side, the cast is likable and the story lines are oddly compelling."
5,amazing show,"enough cannot be said about this true gem of comedy genius. i feel like i have a better sense of humor having watched every episode. just to clarify an earlier review by ""a viewer from los angeles"", the show was on for 3 seasons, (30 total episodes), and matt besser and amy poehler are not real life husband and wife. according to the IMDB, poehler is married to some guy named will arnett. besides that, great review for a truly amazing show."
5,TO: Comedy Central RE: Future seasons...,"Dear suits, RELEASE SEASON TWO NOW. Unless you'd prefer my money going to bootleggers. If the people want it, they WILL get it. It's up to you if you want a portion of the money or not...By the way, if any of you fellow fans agree with this, join me and write Comedy Central direct."
4,1 Other thing better.,This DVD is sooo worth the buy. THE 2ND SEASON NEEDS TO COME OUT! Its been several years since the show has been cancelled. The 2nd season is even better than the first.
5,greatest comedy ever created,"UCB is the greatest thing ever brought to the world of comedy. This first season is fantastic and it just gets better. anyone who has not seen this should definately check it out. I have been watching it since i recorded it on vhs in the late 90's and it never gets old. I was so happy when I found they made the first 2 seasons on dvd. I hope to everything that is still holy in this world that they produce the final season on dvd, and soon. I am tired of watching it on .avi files and vhs tapes, it just isn't the same. BUY THIS AND BUY THE SECOND SEASON. You won't regret it..."
5,the pinacle of absurdist comedy,I can't think of a more ridiculous and funny show. In my opinion one of the best sketch comedy shows ever. Not having a laugh track or a studio audience helps too.
4,Just what it looks like,"It's a plushie wrist rest with a soft bottom for cleaning LCD screens; comfortable, but not as fancy as the gel-filled ones. It may be too small for adults to use conveniently, because the head is so big."
3,His Head shrunk?!,"Okay, I guess I'm an odd one because I think large heads on plushies are adorable. And so I ordered this plushie under the impression it would have a beautiful large Kyo-head... like shown in the picture. But when I got it, it was considerably smaller (about half the size of the picture)! XDIt's still really cute! and its about the size of my palm (plus fingers)to give you an idea of the size. But i would love it even more if it looked more like the picture, big head and all. ^.^''"
4,"The other ""Watch Out""","The album shown here as DESPERATELY was released in 1976 on the ATCO label (SD 36-136) in the US. The title was WATCH OUT. The artwork was totally different but, as mentioned, the tracklisting is the same. One minor change, the cut listed now as ""Take It All"" was then titled simply, ""It"".""Desperately"" was the album cut receiving a good amount of club play back then and still remains my favorite.1. Broadway Star 3:592. It 3:373. Fire Girl 5:054. Desperately 5:205. High Light 4:206. Sexy Lady 4:407. Better Days 4:258. Lay It Down On Me 4:25"
4,Ellis Unit One a Gem,"If you're a Steve Earle fan, don't let this bargain slip by. Steve and the V-Roys do two versions of the classic ""Johnny Too Bad"", and a great cover of Steve's ""Ellis Unit One"", which is hard to find anywhere but the soundtrack for 'Dead Man Walking'. This one might not make you change your mind on any death penalty issue, but it'll sure make you think about prison guards and bad karma."
4,Interesting and educational.,"This book contains quite a bit of information about the politics of India at a very tumultuous time; the information is presented in a way to make it extremely accessible to young women, which is an impressive feat. It seems to me like a lot of the Pleasant Company's main characters are somewhat rebellious, which makes them more attractive to a modern audience but also probably makes them less realistic. However, supporting characters, like Neela's sister in this book, let us view what more traditional young women would be doing as the action (in this case, Neela risking everything familiar to save her family and help her country) took place."
2,Eh...,"This book is about a girl who is afraid of getting married, and also shows a bit of the struggle over India's independence. Quite frankly, the characters are generic and the plot is chichéd. I give it two stars because it DOES show emotion, and it DOES have a plot, but both are a bit flat and standard."
5,Amazing illustrations,"We liked poems very much, and how artist, Roma Karas,illustratedthem. ""Mural on Second Avenue"" looks very colorful and ""fresh"".We are very glad that we ordered this book."
2,Nantucket: Seasons on the Island,"Seasons of the Island was more of an ""artsy"" pictorial then it was insight on the the Island. I was disappointed because I've never been to Nantucket and I was expecting to 'learn' about the Island. The pictures were beautiful but I couldn't appreciate what I was looking at because the author did nothing to describe the history or points of interest. I felt that he was trying to win a photography contest more then anything. It almost seemed that the author was trying to 'wow' the reader with his attempt at using a certain photography 'technique' rather then showing off the beauty of Nantucket. I don't know, I'm not an expert, just a girl who is fascinated with the Island and wanted to be swept off my feet from it's beauty when I opened the book but it didn't happen."
3,Great music...wrong keys!,"Bucchino's songs are wonderful to sing...he gives you so much to play as a singer/actor. I purchased this songbook to work some of the music from the album...To my dismay: much of the music is written in key signatures that are different! The beautiful tenor piece ""Unexpressed""...which soars when sung by Adam Guettel on the disc--is written in the ""basement"" key--no tenor would want to touch it! On the plus side, ""Grateful"" & ""You Know Better"" keys are just fine. If you're looking for songs transposed into specific keys, go to the Bucchino website & you find that they are available for purchase! @ $10.00/per they are expensive...but no more expensive (for me) than purchasing this songbook where I can only use 1 piece (I already had Grateful/You Know Better). Proceed with caution!"
4,Law and Order: The Sixth Year,"Law & Order is a great TV show, and I will be glad when they put the other 12 episodes on DVD."
5,Personal,"Excellent. I am totally pleased with this product, and anxiously awaiting release of new versions in the Law & Order series."
1,dunno,this film was ordered and paid for but never did show after repeated tries. it is a ripoff that I paid for but never got to see.
4,Achenbach is a must for your library,"I read through entire chapters of this book on and off while trying to understand the literature in the wave propagation of solids. What I liked about it is that it develops everything with Rigor from the fundamentals. Chapter 6 is very useful for wave guides, but it covers most all topics in wave propagation. Great reference, could be better if it had more examples, but what it lacks in examples, it makes up for in its detail derivations of all of the basic principles."
5,as hard as QM in physics,"to study this hard subject, subject as hard as QM in physics, can become the #1 nation boss!"
5,Learning Finn can be fun,Dr. Risko has written an outstanding introductory Finnish book that helps make studying and learning a very difficult language both rewarding and fun. The book is composed of a variety of lessons that involve common everyday interactions one would have when visiting Finland. The author's style is easy to follow and it's quite obvious she enjoys teaching languages. I highly recommend this book to anyone who may need to learn Finn or just has a curiosity about the Finnish language. This is the book to read and study if you are planning a trip to Suomi.
4,Corvette Wheel,"Quality of the wheel is great and better than expected. I installed it and it looks great, feels great. One problem that the manufacturer should have let the customer know about or provided the solution with the wheel: Your horn will not work because the aluminum on the new wheel is twice as thick as the original wheel. The solutions is to buy 3 washers about 1/16"" thick to put behind the horn ring contact mechanism. The washers have to be fiber or nylon (non-conductive) or the horn will be on all the time. The horn will not work without the washers to space the horn ring out to make up for the added thickness of the wheel. When the modification is completed, it looks like it is suppose to and the all works very well."
5,like a glass of whiskey...,"...or maybe some absinth? anyhow, the location where this music is to be heard normally, the drink costs about at least a hundred dollars. the view from the window reminds to the times of ""windows of the world"". compiled and composed with a great atmospherical feeling for the night at about 3 a.m."
5,Gayatri Mantra review,"This cd begins with a brief introduction to the Gayatri Mantra. The narrator shares information about the Sanskrit terms and their meanings. She also gives a brief description of the ritual of the mantra which is recited daily (dawn,noon and dusk). During her narration, the mantra is quietly chanted in the background. After this introduction, the remainder of the cd is the mantra recited repeatedly in a soft meditative manner with soft musical accompaniment."
4,"Good toy, but big","I got this ball as one size up from a smaller and less expensive brand that I had gotten for my smaller kids. My son is tall and wears 6T. The ball is big for him and big enough for me 5'9"". This ball is good quality even though the handle has already cracked (4stars, it is meant to be held by the side pieces not the top piece) and is big enough for an adult to bounce on. Which we have much to our kids delight. If you are familiar with these bouncy balls and how to size them you will be fine but I wasn't so we have a big red monster in our house that will provide years of fun."
2,Didn't Bring Me Up to Speed as I Expected...,"By the time I bought this CD, it was well dated. A few cuts were outdated and I didn't think were qualified Neo-Soul when they were new. I was doing mobile DJ'ing at the time of purchase and thought the CD would better introduce me to the genre, since I'm more 70s-80's old school. Nyah..!"
4,Oh...Kay...,I like that it was more story than sex. The story was not as good as hills have size but its still very good.
4,romance in the flash,it was all right it wazent grat though and i think it sold of been more of a stroy for it
5,good book for SAP APO,"This book is very detailed. I got value from the chapters on liveCache, the various app modules, and the back-up and recovery section. It's good if you have experience with R/3, but maybe not for a complete novice. I'm interested in optimization, but it also has some of the best implementation information I've seen."
3,Base city - day excursion model = good; updating = suspect,"You have to wonder about a guidebook that says ""most reliable"" and ""2005"" on the cover but contains details from two years ago.The ""Crossing the English Channel"" section is my favorite. The narrative on Page 41 mentions ""only three hours to Paris and ... two hours, forty minutes to Brussels"", and looks forward to the day when ""[h]igh-speed tracks will ... be constructed within Britain"". That day arrived in September, 2003, when the first section of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link opened. Paris is already down to 2 hours, 35 minutes and Brussels, to 2 hours, 20 minutes. Curiously, the schedules on Page 44 are recent and do reflect the new timings.This makes me wonder whether the publisher takes updates seriously -- or just puts in new schedules and changes the cover.On the plus side, I do think that the book's base city - day excursion approach is useful."
4,Reissue of obscure Brazilian soul album,"Os Diagonais ""Os Diagonais (Cada Um Na Sua)"" (RCA Records, 1971)This is a reissue of an early 1970s rock-soul album by the Brazilian band Os Diagonais. Among the band's members was singer-guitarist Hyldon Souza, along with other members of the ""Black Rio"" soul scene. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
4,The Godmother series takes a great cultural shift.,"Scarborough always delivers a good read. This is set in Navajo/Hopi lands AND culture. Familiar characters from the earlier book help the transition. And Grandmother/Webster is a delight. About two chapters in, I realized that I'd read it when it was 1st published. It was great the second time around too!"
5,The art of saltwater flyfishing at its best!,"When I thought that I knew just about all that there was to know after fishingthe northeast coast for 20+ years,along comes Ray's book and I realize there is so much more information that I didn'teven think about.This book is well laid out,precise in its topics and very easy to read.I find myself referring to it'svarious sectons time an again whether I am tying flies or looking for an edge when fishing any new section of the Northeast coast.Everything that thefisher needs to know is in this book in a concise form.His section on waves is absolutely brilliant. I will never look at a wave the same way again."
3,Great fly pattern recipes!,"The book is a good read, and fast! I enjoyed reading Ray's history of the patterns he designed into flies. The flies I have tied and fished from this read are very effective, especially 'Ray's Fly' and the 'Bondorew Bucktail'. With no weight added on an Int. line, there are no better patterns (I have found) for skinny water fishing in Maine! Buy it for the patterns, the read is the frosting."
5,A must read for anyone fly rodding for stripers,"A great additon to any fly fishers library. Simply written and enjoyable to read, ""Stripers and Streamers"" is loaded with information that certainly should help every fly rodder whether novice or experienced. While written from a New Englanders perspective this book should help striper fishermen everywhere. Also contains excellent photos and illustrations"
3,Excellent observations of natural environmental phenomena.,"While Ray's observations of the natural environment surrounding striper fishing is full of excellent advice, his tactics and choice of tackle seems off-beat and contrary to common opinion. You can learn a lot about waves, rocky shorelines and birds in this book, but be careful about taking his word on what lines to use. Also, his choice of the best fly patterns is extremely self-serving; how could he leave out the most productive and popular flies known to striper fisherman?"
4,After the initial nausia..... this stuff becomes ambrosia,"I purchased this from a suggestion of someone who reviews A LOT of fragrances. It certainly is a more musky, powdery, floral scent but it is amazing.I agree with 99 percent of people who buy this and say put this on ahead of time. This perfume is like a butterfly in that it transforms--It initially smells horrible in my opinion, but after 30 minutes to one hour it loses it's harshness and is amazing!I'd give this scent 4.5 just because I really don't like the initial smell... but it becomes so much better as you wear it in a day that I think it makes up for that. It's chemistry so I don't think you can really fault the makers... It probably just works out like that to get that kind of smell."
3,Smells like plastic,"I tried Versace Dreamer when it first came out. The first time I wore it, after a couple hours it smelled to me like the smell of plastic. I would have given it back if I could have. Didn't like it, never used it again."
2,No comments,"Why do I say ""No comments"" as my title?? Because I have never received one comment as to whether this product smells nice or bad. I purchased this after reading several reviews where woman have ranked it at the top of their list. Guess their family must be associated with the manufacturer!It's just sitting on my shelf at this time; only to be used when there is no one that I'm looking to impress."
1,Stay away!!!! NOT AUTHENTIC!!!!,"I purchased from this seller, and the cologne is not authentic. This is one of my favorite cologne and I can tell the difference between the real one and the fake one. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!! I was very disappointed."
1,Most overrated cologne/perfume ever,"Being a collector of fragrances I have to admit that Dreamer caught my eye and after reading nothing but positive reviews I ordered myself a sample. About a week later I got my sample in the mail and sprayed it on my arm. My first whiff of the Dreamer was far from stellar, to be honest it was terrible. I read somewhere that it starts off harsh but the dry-down is amazing. Sure enough I waited about an hour and to my dismay the scent got even worse. If you are thinking about blind buying this little devil be sure to order a sample, DO NOT BLIND BUY VERSACE THE DREAMER. You have been warned. This Eau de Toilette is so powdery that I swear it's geared towards older women. I can't even pick up the tobacco notes because the powder overwhelms my nose giving me extreme headaches. If you dislike the smell of Powdery scents (like the ones on top of your Grandmother's dresser drawers) then stay far away from this bottle of stink."
3,Is it weird? Or wonderful?,"I buy scents for my husband by trying them on myself first - when I first sprayed on Dreamer I thought it was wonderful - unusual, but wonderful. After it developed a while on my skin, I thought it was flat-out weird. It definitely smells of tobacco, and a whole lot of other things, like sweetness mixed with, I don't know what - auto tires? It's hard to describe, and I have a feeling it's a love it or hate it type fragrance. It lasted a long while on my skin and after about an hour or so I didn't really care for it... but when I got home, I asked both my husband and my adult son to give it a sniff, and they both really liked it! So I would recommend it for users who want a unique scent."
4,Fantastic,Smells just fantastic.i love Versace dreamer and the shipment was fast too.Very happy with it..I might buy one more soon.
4,Pleasant,Great Product at a Great Rate. Smells Wonderful. Seller was efficient and honest. Greatly Satisfied.
1,Smells like my mom's perfume.,"I love the Versace Pour Homme that I bought a couple of months ago based on a Men's Health mag smell sample. Therefore, on this one I took a chance, sight unseen - fragrance unsmelled, but it truly smells like a female perfume. I'll never wear it but I kept its packaging nice enough to gift it to someone I don't know very well."
3,Older scent..,"I ordered this cologne as a blind buy. The service was great, I just don't like the scent of the cologne so much. It has a plastic scent mixed with fresh linen when you first spray it. After about an hour it's not so harsh. It dries down a bit powdery. I would descibe the overal scent as, gothic, and mature. People under 30 probobaly won't like this too much. To me & a few people I asked, it smells like an older person scent."
4,last's forever!,Smells a little feminine but barely. I would almost say its baby powder. The eomen at the bar or my work love it though. Worth the $26 I paid.
5,"Finally, The Scent For Me","Best cologne I have purchased! I finally found a cologne that not only I enjoy, but my wife and people around me comment on every time I wear it. It is not overbearing, but rather draws people in. I have found people talking to me get closer than if I wear another cologne. Shipping was fast and the price was great. Highly recommended."
3,Good addition to any Corvair enthusiast's library,"A thorough review of the outward differences between all the Corvair models produced. Will help anyone's Corvair restoration. I was hoping to find a review of the ""internal"" differences, between the various years and models of Corvair engines, but this information wasn't included."
2,this book blows,"Ok if you are looking to restore to factory condition this book isnt all that bad. Just dont expect the photos to help any. It dosent even look like an amature photographer, the photos are horrible details are hidden in shadow so so the pic becomes useless. I found very little info on the car, most info was on the year to year changes such as badging, wheels, interior/exterior trim, etc...I returned the book this is info one can get elsewhere..."
2,An Inaccurate Sanitized Version,"The Mabinogion is a marvelous collection of early Welsh legends and Arthurian tales. However, if you want an accurate translation of the original work, this is not the edition you want. Lady Guest has ""cleaned-up"" certain parts of the tales because she considered them offensive. The only reason you might want this version is if you are overly concerned about giving an accurate version to a young child. Or if you have a specific interest in the history of scholarship of the Mabinogion. Otherwise, I would recommend getting one of the more recent, more accurate translations of the Mabinogion."
2,stilted translation,"Unless one wants to read this for its historical value, there are better and more modern translations of this work. Published in the mid-nineteenth century, the language is often stilted, which might cause the reader to miss some of the more subtle details in these otherwise beautiful stories."
3,Difficult Read,"This review is 100% opinion. While the mythology and legends inside are interesting, full of great characters and contain wisdom and understanding of the Celtic mindset, I felt that the storytelling itself was very poorly done. This may be a result of the translation, I haven't read another version yet to compare, or it may be a result of the writing itself. In either case, I couldn't immerse myself fully into the stories. They didn't ""carry me away"" as it were."
5,Litter Box Begone!,"I set a jar of this down next to the litter box. It was 90F today and nobody was home, but when I got back, even though the litter box had been used there was no odor. At all. I clean the box every day (once in the morning, once at night), I've tried litter box deodorant powder, I've tried leaving a box of open baking soda out - you name it. It's still nigh impossible to keep it from smelling when used on a hot day. But this manages it.I've seen people complaining that the smell of the deodorant is too subdued, but that's exactly what I want. I don't want it to smell like a bottle of Febreeze exploded. I'd rather have no odor at all, and apparently they make such a version, but this is restrained enough for me.That said, the shipping is rather steep if you buy it here. But it does work."
5,Smells great,"These are pricey but worth it. They last a long time, approximately 3 months and smell very clean. Would buy again"
3,Umm...Works When It Feels Like It,"This product is just okay...sometimes it seems to work, but honestly I only seem to smell it when I shift it around. I don't think it is great at absorbing any odors, but it may help slightly. I use it near my cat's litter box so maybe nothing can tackle these odors. I will say it does not dissipate too quickly, as I have read in some reviews. This particular smell is amazing and it is not too strong for those with sensitive noses. All around, the product has only been okay for me but it may work for someone else. I prefer a lit Yankee Candle."
2,To Brief,"I could not use this book for a reference. The content is to brief. This book is like a novel, Once you've read it, your're done, and will never go back read it again. The pictures inside is also very poor, some even completely can not be read. I bought this book because I wanted to know about web site security. But the security chapter only (briefly) discuss on several types encryption. This book should not titled as Web Programming Methods."
5,Excellent coverage of wide-range of Web topics,"I found this book to be an excellent work on Internet programming. Although I am an experienced programmer, I'm fairly new to a lot of Web concepts. This book fills in the gap very nicely! I don't think you can say this book is for ""beginners"" or ""advanced users""--I think there is something there for everybody.Two topics I found particulary clear & useful dealt with security and Web databases. There is also a lot of useful material on HTML, Java, and CGI gateways. There is also in-depth coverage of material for Web administration which is probably pretty good too, but since I'm not involved with that, I can't say for sure. But I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in Web development, especially programmer-types."
3,Not as Described,"In the drop down when you are ordering it has 250 envelopes for $5.99 and 500 envelopes for $30.50. Well I ordered the 250 for $5.99 but didn't quite understand how they were so cheap compared to the 500. Received them today and instead of 250, the packing slip says that it should be 50. Well after counting the envelopes I ended up with 72 in the box. Envelopes seem sturdy and even with shipping it's still cheaper than getting them at Wal Mart or any of the office supply stores. Just don't think that you are going to get 250 envelopes."
4,Nice and conveinant,Nice envelopes but cheaper at SAM though. Still have to put tape on the back of them so the envelope stays shut
1,"Cheap, bound to rip!","These are made of very thin and cheap paper that rips easily when being handled. Even with a tiny jewelry box inside. I thought they would be like ones I've ordered previously, but definitely not. I'm stuck with them unfortunately, so buyer beware!"
3,Not adequately described,"These ""4x8"" envelopes can only fit a 3-1/2 by 6-1/2 inch item. The materials are OK. The flap could be a little heavier construction. A real description would have been helpful. Price and shipping were decent."
4,good service,"The service was good..there was significant delay in the book being delivered, but after immediate response to an enquiry, all in all I was well pleased"
3,3 1/2,"Nothing special here for people that know Hatebreed. Some really simple Crushing guitar riffs, some decent double bass drumming, and some angry vocals. Hatebreed as an slightly above average Hardcore Metal band. There are some songs that are really kick a#s on this album, but some of it is a bit repetitive, yet once again we are looking at a hardcore band, and most of them today flat out suck. Hatebreed is decent because they take somewhat of a metal flavor and incorperate it into their music. Nothing special once again, yet a pretty decent band that you can stomp your neighbor to...ENJOY"
3,I SEE THE HOMELESS IN THE STREET,"Is this what his lyrics are amounting to? I never really liked them but pretty soon i think they are going to sound somewhat like this *ahem*TREES TREES, I LOVE TREESDON'T CUT THEM DOWN THEY GIVE OXYGENLOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR, AS BEST AS YOU CANBECAUSE THEY WILL GIVE YOU GARDENING EQIUPMENTSO YOU CAN PLANT TREES....PERSEVERANCEThe guitars are good though..."
2,The Rise Of MEDIOCRACY,"Just as track two's gang vocals yell ""Straight to your face with the truth"" is how I'm bring it to you. This album is just as the title suggests, MEDIOCRE. This album lacks where as Satisfaction and Perserverence flourished. The redundant riffs, some of which are from the previous album. The songs aren't as powerful as tracks like ""Burn The Lies"" and ""Before Dishonor"" from Satisfaction and songs like ""I Will Be Heard"" and ""Proven"" from Perserverence. These songs are anthems, which Brutality is missing. I guess Riggs Ross brought more to the song writing process then conceived. I Mean Brutality does have it's moments like the opening track ""Tear It Down"", but which is coincidently the outro from the last record. Other tracks like ""This Is Now"" and ""Another Day, Another Vendetta"". However This is a must have if you are a fan of Hatebreed. However if you are new to Hatebreed buy ""Satisfaction Is The Death of Desire"". That is by far their most powerful album."
5,Hatebreed's Best,This is their best record to date. Rare album that has absolutely no weak songs at all. A MUST buy. Hatebreed is the best hardcore/metal around.
2,nahh i expected more from it!,"I THOUGHT THAT HATEBREED WOULD FINALLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE SATISFACTION IS THE DEATH OF DESIRE, BUT NO! THESE GUYS ARE DONE FOR AND I DONT THINK THEY WILL BE ABLE TO RELEASE SOMETHING AS GOOD AGAIN."
2,In the wake of KoRn Wannabee's... yawn...,"Well, yet another KoRn ripoff with Metalica guitar riffs. These guys get an extra star because they did at least attempt to disguise themselves with a lot of lyrics you can't understand. But again that to is nothing new.If you like this type of music then buy it by all means, but at least buy it from among the dozens of bands that do it better. And please stop indulging bands like this who just throw together material from other bands they like and try to sound good."
1,Duhh...,"Well,another album from Hatebreed,and what can I say?nice guitars,simple,but good,drums are poor,but neat...but what da F**K is wrong with th vocals? I mean,give me a break,please...listening to that guy gives me a big headache,he simply never changes is tone of voice!!!Anyway,there are much better stuff to listen to...spend your time listening good metal...old or Nu,doesent matter,there are great bands,but please,not HateBreed"
1,hatebreed music is boring and stupid,bad bad bad bad bad bad bad sucks im sick of tired of hatebreed all thire songs sound the same i can name 100 bands that sound like hatebreed they do nothing new with thire music the same S**T over and over come on guys i dont see what the hell is so great about this band or the other albums they make this album should get 0 satr
3,heavy...erm....no.,"Hatebreed isn't heavy. Sorry to burst your Nu-Metal bubble, but they're not. They are just another nu-metal band that just happens to have the word ""hate"" in their name. If your a nu-metal junkie that thinks Slipknot is talented, you'll probably like this CD. However if you know what a ""solo"" is you're not going to find it heavy at all, in any way shape or form. 3 Chords on a guitar, horrible drums and clean vocals does not mean heavy.Over hyped album that appeals to nu-metal fans."
2,Not too sick.,"I can only think of three reasons why you would ever want to buy this:1. You're afraid of getting beaten up by Hatebreed fans2. You desire to own the most ridiculously titled record ever3. You have no taste in music, or even hardcore/metalBy-the-numbers, generic, boring, dull-as-dishwater, unoriginal, uncreative, unexciting...the negative modifiers for this album are practically infinite. If you're into tough-guy hardcore and are even considering purchasing this, pick up Buried Alive's The Death of Your Perfect World instead, which is at least a 3-star album in my opinion and pretty much the same thing as Hatebreed, only better of course.2 stars because it's not nu-metal, screamo, emo, or pop-punk."
5,Great cd...if you know what hardcore is and like it,"Hatebreed is on the forefront of Hardcore these days and justifiably so. They produce one adrenaline pumping album after another, regardless of their label. To all of you who review this who obviously dont know what Hardcore is, you shouldnt review something if you are ignorant of it. Yes, they scream! Yes, the beats are simple! and YES, its f'ing hard! Its called HARDCORE!! If you cant handle it, just keep listening to Muddvayne and Slipknot and Gay-tallica and quit crying when you hear Hardcore! If you like these guys check out Bury Your Dead and Throwdown."
4,Brutal!!!!!,This has got to be the best Hatebreed album to date. It's raw and brutal! I've followed them since their second album and they still pack a punch. It's a great album to have and great album to listen to when you want to vent.
1,ugh,Sounds like a million other bands that over use the double bass drum and yell into the mike. I give it one star cuz I might need it to scare flies away from the picnic table one day.
1,Horrible.,"This sounds EXACTLY like their past two records. I really tried to get into this, hoping Jamey might change up his voice once in awhile, or maybe the band would get creative, but, alas, no such luck. They suck."
1,suck,"Hatebreed are the absolute worst band in metal today. I do not understand what is so great about this band, talentless musicians team up with the most annoying vocalist (who, by the way, won that bullsh*t contest on uranium), if you think this is heavy, you need to wake up. This is as heavy as slipknot. If you want REAL metal, listen to cannibal corpse, in flames, slayer, dying fetus, the black dahlia murder. This IS crap."
1,Only posers & jocks enjoy this garbage...,"Its funny how these kids get into a band simply because the think its ""realy heavy or brutal""...Please, this isn't heavy or brutal but just horrible and dumb brainless tough guy winp noise. I dont see anything appealing about this crap or even remotly impressive...I mean why listining to ""music"" that sounds exectly the same is quality as ""brutal"" ?Anyways, its obvious im too old for this new generation so i rather listing to my death collection and my possessed or my morbid angel collection insted of this junk. I say this tho, you want real brutality? Listing to necrophagist or internal bleeding or severe torture, devourment, even, disgore. Hatebreed's ""rise of brutality"" is horrible it should be called rise of p*ssality. Gimme a break !"
5,An Awesome Hardcore Album,"Believe it or not Hatebreed is NOT Nu-Metal. They are a Hardcore band. Yes i know they tune down to B or even C.On this album they pretty much stick to the same formula.(if it aint broke, then dont fix it)Like Prevous album its fast and to the point with the most postive message in the current scene."
4,The rise of Hatebreed,"Those looking for Hatebreed to have evolved or expanded their musical horizons will be disappointed here, but that's not a bad thing at all. One of the hardest working bands in metal today, Hatebreed continue to deliver unadulturated, uncompromising metal ear candy with ""Rise of Brutality"" the follow up to their major label debut ""Perseverance"". Vocalist Jamey Jasta continues to deliver his larynx crushing screams at a frantic pace to the tune of grinding guitars and a booming rhythm section that continues to impress. ""Rise of Brutality"" is a step above ""Perseverance"", but doesn't quite come to the level of Hatebreed's indie classic ""Satisfaction is the Death of Desire"", but this is one of the best metal albums of the year. Standout tracks include ""Tear it Down"", ""Straight to Your Face"", ""Facing What Consumes You"", ""Another Day, Another Vendetta"", and the excellent closer ""Confide in No One"". Long time Hatebreed fans rejoice; Hatebreed is sticking to their roots."
4,The Rise of brutal hardcore....,"....must definetly be accredited to Hatebreed. Picking up after bands such as Agnostic Front and Madball, Hatebreed have set the bar a little higher for hardcore metal. Some people dont realize Hatebreed's been rocking since the late 90's, but I have not heard any of thier old releases. With the Rise of Brutality, Hatebreed have proven themselves once again, I personally think the album is better made than Perserverance, with longer, more structured songs, and Jameys voice and lyrics are just amazing throughout. This CD is currently one of my favorites, although I have not listened to it for some time. Hatebreed is recommended for fans of straight up metal and hardcore, they must not be taken lightly."
5,Good book overall,"This book is not really what the subtitle, ""A season on the run with a maverick baseball agent"", recommends. It is more of a description of the Sosnick-Cobbe sports agency, Matt Sosnick's biography, Sosnick's business approach, a history of baseball agents, a picture of the cutthroat business, Scott Boras' biography, and a basic how to of the agent business. All this information is randomly spewn about. It is like a picture you look at closely and think that it looks sloppy but when you take a look at the whole thing it is a masterpiece. Read the whole book before you make an opinion."
4,Glad I found this book at my local library,"An easy read, entertaining, though not necessarily eye-opening. Crasnick tells the story of a rare breed of baseball agent: one who actually cares about something beyond his wallet."
2,For Hardcore Fans Only,"Not the most exciting book out there. But if you like minor league baseball, this book's worth a quick read."
3,A small book - good start for a longer journey,"This is a kind of a summary of books Hiro wrote on this subject.At the time of its publishing this book was up-to-date, had a few good maps taken from the larger works and summed up in a short form a lot of topics that Washington was supposed to study before going to war.But this still is a VERY short summary of a number of themes, good only if you dont need detailed knowledge or you really want to check what Dilip Hiro was thinking at the eve of the recent American war."
2,"Good product, poor quality control","This is the second Swissgold TF200 Tea Ball I have purchased. I bought this one because the first one I bought was well made and has steeped many excellent cups of tea. I wanted one for home and one for the office. I really like the product. However, there is one thing I am not happy with. This one I purchased from Amazon is defective and should never have made it out of the factory. There are no drain holes in the bottom of the ball. There are some molded indentations where the drain holes should be. I guess the Quality Control department just missed this one.Pros: allows loose tea room to steep and expand, easy to cleanCons: lack of quality control by the manufacturer, Frieling"
4,"A little large, but good","I got this tea ball after being fed up with other variants I had with pores that were too large and allowed tea to fall into my cup. This infuser works wonderfully, albeit at a higher price than I would prefer.My only complaint besides the price would be the size. If you're the kind to leave the tea ball in your cup, bear in mind that this will take up most of the mug."
3,Great except hard to brew tea properly,"I find I get the best steep if I pour the water over the leaves. It's hard to do that with this filter because it has a cap. I recommend the filters with handles, AKA the brew baskets."
3,aw'ight,"having seen a lot a def comedy jams on hbo...and hopin' that this would take me back to when i'd be laughin' so hard i was cryin' cause of how crazy dey can get...i would say that this doesn't represent the funniest of 'em like i thought it would - especially when they call it an ""all star"" jam, but the second jam on the tape, hosted by martin lawrence, saved this from being a video not really being worth buyin' to one that may not be da best of da best, but does have enough crazy to keep on hand when you wanna laugh. just so you know - this is basically two half hour shows and not splices of the funniest comedians they've had."
5,Dawn of War Gold Edition,This game lives up to the title of Game of the Year. I am very happy with the Game.
3,Warhammer,"This was a gift for my brother. I got to play it after he finished it. The game was enjoyable enough. I didn't make it all the way through, but he did, and really enjoyed it."
4,great deal,"This is a great game. It has alot of depth and variations. The newer versions of this game may look better, but has no where near the depth and quality of play that this game has. Build your army and conquer the galaxy!Great deal on this game, it has several armies and maps to play. You can take the armies and repaint them to make them look the way you want them."
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"Bought this here. Does not load. Steam is unable to find my internet connection. Customer Support is non-responsive. Not sure why Steam has to be updated to load game: certainly not user friendly.(Win 7, 64 bit)"
2,Terrible way to buy a great game,"Brief and to the point:Warhammer Dawn Of War Platinumcontains both games included here, as well as Dark Crusade and is much cheaper ($27.99 as of this writing) the Dark Crusade expansion adds 2 more playable races and a new campaign. Why pay more for less?"
4,Worth it for any gamer,"For only 20$, this package is a must have. The main reason you will want to purchase this is if you plan to play multiplayer with Dark Crusade. With this, you will have 5 races in addition to the 2 from the second expansion. The campaign for the original Dawn of War is very short and moderately fun but introduces you to everything as well as the story. Winter's Assault is a big leap in the single player department and provides the Imperial Guard for online use.If you like RTS then this is a very unique and exciting experience. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good game of RTS."
3,"good game, flawed package","While this is a good game, and a good expansion, there's one glaring problem. This Gold Edition DOES NOT accept any of the patches required to play the game online. Relic refuses to answer my questions sent to them about this. If you are looking to play other humans via the internet, buy the game and expansions separate.This review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com"
2,Inflator nozzle,"The product inflates tires. It is supposed to have a built in pressure gauge, which it does, even if it is totally inaccurate. I was very disappointed in this product. The seller shipped it in a timely fashion, and it arrived in good shape. It is just an inferior product. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,O mago apresentador,"Flavio Cavalcante foi sem duvida o mago dos palcos da TV brasileira dos tempos aureos. Uma pessoa irreverente que trabalhava no palco como se fra sua sala de estar em casa. Trabalhava em equipe e todos unidos pareciam uma grande familia.Criava quadros novos , inéditos, e dava chance sempre aos calouros ou mesmo para o grande publico apresentar algo novo. Foi uma das grandes perdas da TV brasileira."
2,O mago apresentador,"Este apresentador era sem duvida nenhuma um mago no palco. Era irreverente e original.Fazia do palco sua sala de estar e ainda por cima comandava todos como se fossem seus parentes. Sem dúvida uma grande perda para a TV brasileira. Um """"instante maestro"""" era seu jargao, e ninguem mais conseguiu igualar-se a ele."
4,Awesome book :],this book was really great. i think that it was very well written and is very enjoyable
2,repetition of her first book,"I enjoyed the author's debut novel ""Losing the Moonn"" but this one disappointed me. It was very similar to her first novel....and I am frankly getting a little tired of the women ""remaining true to themselves"" and ""first love"" themes that seem to dominate every book of hers..to the point that it is getting repetetive. We get it, Patti. We women should always remain true to ourselves, and never sell ourselves short, but also never adapt, change, accomodate etc. etc. and when we ""recover what we have lost""--and in many of her novels it is not quite clear what exactly these women have lost--we always need to flirt with our former lovers to do so. So please do us a favor..you write beautifully.. so why dont tackle something different for a change? There are already enough Oprah-backed authors who churn out such rediscovery stuff for women with middle-aged angst."
5,Great story!,Patti Calhoun Henry is a talented writer. I just recently discovered her and have read everything I can get my hands on by her. I then pass them on to my niece who also loves them. A really good read---never a boring minute.

4,affordable luxury,"this seat caught my attention because of the higher weight and height capacity, 29 inches and 22lbs but this seat is also very well made the padding is exceptional compared to evenflo and graco every where is padded the head rest has additional egg shock support and it comes with an additional body pillow for newborns ,until the pillow gets snug and you have to remove it.my daughter was 13lbs and 8 ounces and 25 inches at her 4 month old wellbaby check up in june ,now six months old she still fits and is not hanging out at all.i have to wonder if the previous reviewer removed the body pillow .it does get snug and then you have to use the seat without the pillow.why not five stars ?the instructions are bad the seat is much easier to install without the base.but a good seat overall."
3,Not good for big babies,"Overal the car seat is nice, light weight but I agree with other buyers that it is too small for some babies. I used mine only for 3 months, because I have a tall baby and his feet were outside the car seat. I was a pretty big investment for only 3 months of use, not to mention that I have purchased the stroler frame too.Combi Connection LX Infant Car Seat Black"
3,"Lots of great recipes, but horrible index ruins it","With over 1,000 recipes, this book is undoubtably the most extensive chocolate cookbook I've ever seen. You name it, it has it! But don't be surprised if you can't find the recipe you're looking for.The index for this book is absolutely the worst I have ever seen in any book, because it only references ingredients, not the recipes themselves. It took me almost ten minutes to find a recipe for chocolate brownies, because I had to scan entire chapters from beginning to end until I found it. I can guarantee you that you will go insane trying to find a particular recipe in this book. That's why I gave it only three stars. It would have gotten five stars otherwise."
3,Not for the novice,"If you have never read the Analects in a more contemporary translation, then stay away from the Ezra Pound version, because you will most likely not understand the text (for example, compare verse 2.4 versus any other translation out there). The Pound version is much more interesting after you have read the Analects at least once and have a view of what the verses mean."
4,Watercolor pencils,This was a gift for my step-daughter she's the artist in the family. I'm always looking for items for her use for her drawings being that she also design clothes i thought these would be perfect for her drawings.She likes these alot.
1,Not durable at all,"I bought this to cover an area in my back yard. After only about 3 months it is already cracking and breaking up. Save your money. This is that same as the cheap $5 ones at Walmart. Horrible, Horrible quality."
1,"Very Little History in This ""Historical"" Mystery","I had hoped to use this book in my high-school history class but found that it does little in terms of imparting a solid sense of what life was like in ancient Rome. The mystery portion is okay, but my real disappointment stems from the weakness of the historical contextualization."
3,its alright but not the best,"I have read nearly everything Francine Rivers writes including ""and the shofar blew"". She is usually a tremendous author and I feel that this book was okay but not all that I have come to hope for in her work. I can attest that the situation described is very plausible and I appreciate her willingness to write it. However it still seemed predictable. While the topic may be bold the plot is the normal Christian fiction pattern; also the names of the characters even gave the plot away a little for me. Nevertheless I can't say I hated it or wasted my time, but she has written many better books than this one."
5,Great book!,I have long enjoyed Francine Rivers books and was not disappointed with her latest work. Her characters are not perfect and the storyline surprises up until the end. Great Book! I definitely recommend it to anyone!
3,The Shofar Blew,A good read ~ Francine Rivers is a wonderful author! This was not as deep as some of her others but a good distraction type book for sure!
5,Wonderful book!,"As a writer and conference speaker, yet having spent 25 year ""in the pulpit,"" I found this book captivating. The characters are very real, the temptations and challenges disturbing. It reminds us of true values and priorities, and how easily and quickly we can lose sight of both. Great book!"
5,And the Shofar Blew,"FABULOUS book! It is so spot on regarding todays issues in the church! I've yet to be disappointed by Francine Rivers! Although this book is fiction, there is absolutely no doubt it is totally based on fact!! This one will stay on my bookshelf & be reread ....Recommend it highly !!"
5,Blew My Mind!,"This book could be written for a lot of churhes hroughout the land. It runs close to the television evangelists..some of the similiar ways of attracting the congregatio was proof of that. Francine Rivers, has always been one of my favorites. Her description in the first few chapters of the elderly people in the churh was, (as the teens today would say,(cool). This story about how a man, guided by a relentless dpmineering father to succeed, builds his church with the wong intention, The question burning in his heart is ""Is he builing this church fir himself (to impress his faher) or is he building the church to the Glory of God ??"
5,And The Shofar Blew,"This was one of the BEST books I have ever read. I am not an avid reader so it takes a lot to keep me interested in a book. I sat down and started reading and could not put this book down. It touched my heart. I love Francine Rivers and this was just as good as all her others. I wish she could put books out faster. Again, this is a ""must read"". Loved it!"
3,A bit disappointed,"Out of all the Francine Rivers books I have read (and love most of them!!) this one is probably my least favorite. It makes some good points and is eye-opening to the dangers a pastor faces when they loose sight of God's plan and character, but I found most of the book to be repetitive and negative. If you haven't read any of Francine Rivers' books, start with ""Redeeming Love,"" an amazing story!!"
4,Great book-really makes you evaluate Who you are living for,"I always enjoy Francine Rivers. She is an excellent writer and she always gets to the heart of the matter-who is the Lord of your life-you or God? I read a review that said that the plot is unbelievable because of a turning point involving a jack rabbit. However, if God can change a man who was killing and persecuting Christians on his way into town (Paul) I think he could do it to Francine's Paul Hudson with a jack rabbit if He chose to. I never underestimate the power of God to radically change lives and He often does it in an unexpected way. I always enjoy how Francine Rivers uses her characters in her novels to illustrate Biblical principles, bring to life Bible stories, and to bring us face to face with our own sin and our desperate need for Jesus.I recommend this book and any other book by Francine Rivers. You won't be able to put it down until you have read it from cover to cover."
5,God Can Teach Even In a Novel,"I have learned over my life that God can teach where, when and however he wants you to learn. I have learned so much about myself and who I want to become as a pastor. I feel more like Stephen then Paul in the book even though I am not had trouble with achole, I have had my own deamons that are just as damaging and the Lord has to work with me on a daily basis. Read the book you will love it."
5,FRANCINE WRITE MORE BOOKS!!!,I just started reading her books and I haven't been disappointed yet. I couldn't put this book down. It let's you see that preacher's can make mistakes too. We are all human and not perfect. I can't wait to read more of Rivers books.
2,Not her best...,"Francine Rivers could have done a lot better with this book. I literally look online at least once a month to see if she has a new book out, and when I saw the Shofar Blew was thick and had an interesting title I got excited. I have read every single one of her books and this one wasn't even close to what I know her capable of. The ending of the book was too fast and not believable. Yes, God can do all things through anything, but one jack rabbit in the road is quite unlikely to bring healing and restoration to the Hudson family. Let's go back to Marcus Valerian and his father--people who really saw Christ and were change by Him! Artfully written, but not even close in comparison to her previous works."
1,A waste of time--the shofar hits a sour note,"I had never heard of this author and downloaded this audiobook to listen to while walking. I found it shallow and boring. The characters were predictable, uninspiring and uninteresting. Even my dog objected when I suggested we try listening to one more chapter to see if the shofar would blast."
3,And the Shofar Blew,"As a long time fan of Francine's work, I was disappointed in this story's ending. I am the daughter of a Baptist minister. My family experienced many struggles related to the ministry which included several affairs on my father's part. While I could completely identify with much of this story, and the thought processes of a pastor, I felt like Francine got tired of writing and just stopped short. Suddenly David get's caught and struggles a bit and then he ""get's it"" and turns his life back in the right direction. While this seems too easy, it could happen. If it did happen, this is just the beginning of the story and not the end. I truly wish that Francine had written another 100 pages so that the reader could understand exactly what this pastor and his wife go through after he gives up his pulpit and remains in the city as a teacher. My parents divorced and I ended up in the same small town. It was quite a struggle to say the least."
4,THE DARK FRONTIER SAGA,"I think Mr.Millhouse is going to go far in this business, cause this is his first book that I know of, and it is one of the best sci-fi's I read this year. He really takes you in to his world and you don't want to leave, and I am looking forward of reading more of his work. If you have not read this book I urge you to I don't think you will regret it"
4,"The Dark Frontier Saga, is thrilling.","I read the Drak Frontier Saga with a grain of salt. I always think the worse before I read any book, especially ones that call themselves a SAGA. But to my suprise the story was well written for a first time author. It focused mostly on characterization. But there was enough plot to keep you wanting to read more. With likeable characters from heroes and villians and a vast number of aliens the Dark Frontier Saga is easy to read and understand if you are in middle school or out of school. I can't wait to read more. I'm sure Charles F. Millhouse will one day be a famous. I would love to tell you about all the story plots but I feel you must read this book if you love science fiction, it has all the elements of becoming a classic."
2,D-80 Video,"These Videos are supposed to be a Tutorial for beginners, but seem to move a little to fast for the Novice! I fully admit to not being The sharpest tool in the shed but the video of some guy flailing his fingers around this camera is kind of like that film of Ruebenstein on PBS trying to teach Piano to beginners! The only way to progress along with something as complex as these new Tech cameras is to study the Nikon Quick start guide Only that will get you up and running.Jim Copeland Boca Raton FL."
3,A pleasant and enjoyable novelty,"I am not really familiar with the Broadway career of D. Gibson. I know her as a singer of pop songs and as a big star during the 80's. It is surprising to find out that she has played various roles on musicals. Anyway, the CD is a novelty. What is interesting here are the selection of the songs. Also, she is brave enough not to use the original arrangements and re-invent some songs. I particularly like Raise the Roof, I'd Gotta leave while im in love.However, the downside of this recording is the vocal attack on the singer on some songs. In most of the songs, she sometimges seems not to hit the right note. She often scoops her voice. she also sounds more like a pop singer than a singer-actress.The saving grace of this CD is the arrangement of the songs. Also, despite the unconventional vocal technique, the songs are given more focus, than the singer"
5,Great Combination !,"Deborah once promised her fans she would record a B'way album.Here it is, better than we could ever expect it.Deborah fans got used to admire either her brilliant songs and her theatrical skills, one at a time.This album brig the best of Deborah all together.It is amazing.You gotta hear it so you can understand what I mean..."
1,OUCH!,"Deborah Gibson is a talented rock star. With a good musical director, she has proved herself to be a wonderful musical theatre performer. This album, however, is a very uneasy marriage of the two genres. She sings every showtune on the album as if it's a pop tune with horrendous bubble gum arrangements. I have seen Miss Gibson in two musicals and have heard her sing showtunes live on other occasions- she knows how to sing showtunes. On this album, however, she's trying to pander to her pop audience and in the process, she created an album that fails as a pop album and as a showtune album. I can only hope that Miss Gibson finds a better musical director the next time she decides to record showtunes."
2,MISTAKE IN THE CREDITS,"Take her or leave her, i give her credit for going broadway, and then spreading these tunes, by these diverse group of artists, out into the stratosphere.now, to my point: CAN SOMEBODY GET THESE SONG CREDITS RIGHT? RAISE THE ROOF IS FROM THE OFF-BROADWAY 'WILD PARTY' BY ANDREW LIPPA, NOT THE BROADWAY VERSION BY MICHAEL JOHN LACHIUSA.I don't mind LaChiusa getting royalty money whatever the case, I am a fan of his version of the full length poem, not much of Lippa's, but people. Somebody get this righ and corrected."
1,I've been a diehard fan for 16 years...,"...and I don't care for this album. There are some parts that sound pretty cool, like the beginning of the 1st song, but throughout most of the songs Deborah just overdoes it. It's disappointing, but even Mark McGuire doesn't hit a homerun at every at-bat. Hoping for better next time..."
1,You have to be a diehard fan to like this.....,"I've listened to this album several times.She has a thin and uneven voice, shouting most of the time. Sounds like an amateur at a song contest.If you're not a fan of Deborah Gibson, this album certainly won't win you over."
1,Oh God Help Us.,"This is truly awful. The set might have been helped if she had chosen to include the 1996 recordings of ""People"" and ""Dont Rain On My PArade"".I just dont know what in God's name she is hoping to achieve by putting out such an awful album..a recording contract maybe? well, mission acomplished, but at what price. Deborah's last truly great album was, in my opinion, her self titled 1997 release. I will continue to buy her music, but I no longer look foward to it. Very, Very, disapointing."
5,DEB SPARKLES & MORE THAN PROVES HERSELF WITH COLORED LIGHTS!,"All I can say is ""WOW"". When I popped in this cd and heard Debs voice very faintly counting softly on ""Let Me Entertain You"" a smile immediately pounced across my face. I knew this was going to be one kick ass album from Deborah. I believe it may be her best to date! For any of you hesitant on buying this, please don't listen to the negative reviews! Deborah is in top form here. She more than dazzles us with her beautiful ever-growing range vocals. I am so proud of her, and proud and honored to be a fan of hers. Deb! You never cease to amaze me! You always come through with something bigger n' better! Go out and by this album today and see how the little ""Out Of The Blue"" pop princess has turned into the diva she is today! *****COLORED LIGHTS IS THE WAY 2 GO!!!*****"
1,The worst film I have ever seen. REALLY!,"Now don't get me wrong, John Woo is one of my favorite filmmakers. Yet, A Better Tomorrow 2 is his worst film. When such formulaic action and melodrama goes completely wrong, you get the monstrocity that is this film. This is the single most unbalanced, excessively violent, and meaningless piece of junk I've ever layed eyes on."
2,Few sequels are better than the originals...,"... and this movie is no exception. For fans of violent action for its own sake only; those who are expecting the drama and terse emotion of the original will be disappointed.An unfortunate waste of the talents of Chow Yun-Fat and Leslie Cheung, but as usual the action sequences are lovingly crafted by John Woo."
3,"If you love this film, you're missing the point.","John Woo's best films are not just about beautifully choreographed violence. They have themes -- frienship, loyalty, duty -- that are as strong as those of an old-time samurai picture. ABT2 does NOT have any of those, and that's why it's bad.I have re-watched this film a few times, for a brainless thrill. But the next time you read a review saying how ""awesome"" this film is, keep in mind that Woo is never aiming for ""awesome"" violence. In fact, he says he hates violence, and puts it in his films when it's subordinate to the themes he wants to get across.The best thing about this film is that Tsui Hark (who produced) wanted Woo to make it even more violent, and Woo declined. This led to Woo breaking away from Hark totally when he made ""The Killer"" -- now there's a picture that has everything ABT2 is begging for."
3,Good Flick.,The cd was a little more scratched then I excepted but it still played. it came in on time and still a good flick.
5,A Better Tomorrow II,I loved this movie. i have since bought the dvd. It is better than the first one. Even in subtitles. I now have it in english.
3,Chow down on this,"Not as good as the first (i don't even know what it's called in China) but i have not seen a movie with Chow Yuen Fat in it i didn't like emensly. even Anna and the King and Crounching Tiger, Chow is a fantastic actor and I hope he makes more movies"
5,DVD purchase,I ordered A Better Tomorrow II on DVD and received it so fast that I just couldn't believe it. I bought it as a gift and it was extremely well received. The quality was so good that it has been played over and over again. Thank you for your prompt and contientious response to my order.
2,Unknown,"Please read my other review on this film distributed by another studio, Anchor Bay Entertainment."
4,"Not Woo's best, but still great!","John Woo is without a doubt one of the most incredible directors ever to have created a movie. His movies are shot with a style that no other director has. But it seems that he rushed his way through this film, but that's not to say it's not brilliant. The ending is fantastic, but it is a little bit to short, compared to his other epics like, ""Hardboiled"", and ""The Killer"". the story isn't to be taken to seriously, and was ment to be a parody of his earlier gangstar movie, ""A Better Tomorrow"". If you get a chance see it, I'm sure you will not be disappointed."
4,Rent it for the rice scene,"I don't think a sequel to ""ABT"" should have been made. The first one is a classic...so good that it was hard to top. Furthermore, since Mark Gor(Chow) is already dead in the first one, it makes the story involving him as a twin brother in ""ABT-II"" sound kind of stupid. A good movie must not only come with good directing, but also a good plot-which this lacks. However, it is worth to watch for the scene in which Chow forces a guy to eat his fried rice. Chow's facial expression is funny, and his performance in that scene shows real talent. It also gives a sneek peek at what he can do in comedy movies, which is often overshadowed by his action movies. It is not worth it to buy the whole ABT set, because the series is not connected well. I would only recommend buying ""ABT-I"", but renting the other two for all you Chow Yun Fat fans. By the way, his last name is Chow, not Fat."
4,Very Large Capacity Internal Hard Drive,"I've only had this Western Digital internal hard drive for about a week, but so far it seems to be working as normal. The version I got was a so-called OEM, which is the commonly (mis)-used term for bulk packaged. Meaning no box, no instructions, no SATA cable. But since I've had previous hard drives from Western Digital, this wasn't really a problem.For the price this is a lot of storage capacity."
5,One Funny Video,"Get ready to laugh. I loved this video.You will want to watch this one again and again. From Ike all the way up to Clinton, you'll see Ford falling, Bush bumbling and Reagan mixing it up in this hilarious video.It has it all... for example... The physical -- falling off podiums and falling down stairs. Microphone bumps to the head and falling down bowling alleys. The verbal -- oops, was this microphone on? ""We're trying to get unemployment to go up, and I think we are going to succeed"" (Reagan) ""You have to go forward to the past, to go past to the back"" (Quayle). And just the downright funny -- Cinton and Yeltsin catching a case of the uncontrollable giggles.You will not be disappointed."
1,less than 5 minutes of funny video on this 40 min tape,"Pretty much a wast of time. There is less than 5 mins of funny video on this 40 min tape. Most of the ""bloopers"" are brief, awful, and with lots of stupid intro, pretty much like the worst of the TV shows. Barely worth watching once."
4,presidential bloopers,I thought this movie was funny. It is 40 minutes long. I bought it for my dad and enjoyed watching it with him. I would recommend it as I thought it was quite cute.
2,Not what I expected,I saw a bloopers video in a gift store in washington dc which was very funny. they were sold out and i thought this was the samen one. well it's not.
3,Really dumb video,The title says it all! One or two laughs but that's about all I can say. You will like the jokes about the politicians you did not like to start. But it is not as funny as I had hoped it would be.
1,Horrible,Extremely dull and boring. Shows incidents that are not very funny at all. Most of them are just small slips or mistakes while talking..That are not even funny. Dont waste your time or money. Please
3,Extremely Funny,"I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. Like every other reviewer says, from Ike to Clinton, both verbal and physical.Presidential contenders also make the cut, so we get Dole, Gore, Quayle, McCain, and Jesse Jackson. It'd be a shame not to get Quayle, wouldn't it?First ladies too, so we can Nancy fall down again and again, and Bess Truman steals the show.Why only three stars? Because it's only 45 minutes long."
2,Disapointing,"There were many funny moments in this video, but overall a disapointment. For some crazy reason, the VHS itself has extra unused tape. The actual length is shorter than the tape itself. So when it is over, you still have all this EXTRA tape. Real strange. I think it is taped in a slow speed."
3,Once every thousand years...,"In this book the gods of ancient Egypt are and have always been. And we can assume that the gods of our ancient Egypt were echoes of these beings. Our story begins in the House of the Dead where Anubis wakes a seemingly undefeatable man whose memory was taken and is to be his emissary. Anubis and Osiris each send an emmissary to a Middle World bent on destroying the only remaining threat to their power.The story is not told in a smooth narrative, but in a series of short and often disjointed episodes. But continue reading, for the story will fall into place. The writting is excellent though, as would be expected from this author. What stood out for me in this book was Madrak, the all-bases-covered agnostic preacher. His prayer still stands out in my memory."
4,Creatures of light and darkness,"An excellent book by Roger Zelazney. The story held my attention from cover to cover. Zelazney's writing style is awesome.Too bad they don't use living proof-readers anymore, as spellcheck doesn't do the job."
2,I should have just gotten it from the library.,"It feels a little harsh to give this book just two stars, but three stars indicates that I liked the book, and I only really liked parts of it. It's mostly the feel of the writing... kind of a prose/poetry hybrid that just doesn't work for me. It has mostly five-star reviews (at least at the time of this writing), so I'm obviously in the minority.I'll probably donate it to either my school library, or the puplic library."
5,Zelazny's best novel,"My favorite Zelazny novel -- funny, strange, vivid & involving. Bit of a disappointing Nding, but....RZ takes the Egyptian pantheon of Gods & has fun with them, much as he did in LORD OF LIGHT, only this 1's funnier. Slow, odd start, but 1nce U get in2 it, U'll have a great time with the larger-than-life battles Btween mythical heroes & villians, the poetry Zelazny throws in2 the story with no advance warning, the fun the characters make of all the hero-story stereotypes -- U'll love it. Zelazny clearly loved a good joke. My favorite section is headed ""Marachek,"" & includes the world's LONGEST run-on sentence -- I had a great time. But B warned -- this ain't no AMBER novel -- it's WAY BETTER...."
1,Cosmic Battles Fought by Prepubescent Teenage Boys,"""Creatures of Light and Darkness"" starts with a wonderful first chapter that explores the metaphysical dynamics of the afterlife, chiefly: What does it mean to be alive or dead once one is no longer organic matter?But things quickly go downhill from here as Zelazny (or his narrator) refuses to give any rhyme or reason as to why you are being introduced to new characters and themes, and what exactly they have to do with the greater story. You either get it or you don't and you'll either reread pages over and over again or just give up because there is probably something better on your bookshelf that you haven't read yet.If you foolishly read through to the end you'll soon regret it and discover that:Cosmic battles between gods play out like playground tussles between prepubescent teenage boys geeking-out in exposition before dueling.Utter, epic fail."
1,"Geez, how painful...","I'm sure that behind all the droning on about identity, life, etc., there was a plot. I just couldn't stay interested long enough to care. The author should have put more weight on the storyline instead. Basically, each chapter goes around and around randomly philosophizing for the majority of its length, and the remainder quickly advances the action or gives plot exposition. This is the 5th Zelazny book I've read, and I'm becoming convinced that ""Lord of Light"" is the only worthwhile and meaningful thing he ever wrote."
1,Cynthia Rylant is wonderful.....,My granddaughter loves Henry and Mudge and I love reading them to her. Sometimes she can actually tell me what is going to happen in the story. Keep up the good work Cynthia..............
5,Good book for my rising 2nd grader!,This book was just the challenge I was looking for! My daughter is a level 3 reader however this book had some challenge words for my daughter. She loved the pictures as well. I would recommend this book for 6 and 7 yr olds.
1,"Great film, crappy Amazon playback","This movie is half cut off if you download it and use Amazon's Unbox application. Not sure how it works on the site, as now that I've downloaded it, I'm unable to see the video in my online library. Nice work, Amazon!"
4,"Educational, Accurate account","This book gives great detail about the history of tanks, their uses in the past, present and in the future. It is factual as well as interesting"
2,CHEWED NOT DIGESTED,"Thanks to my new puppy who chewed the library copy I had I now own a hardback of THE LAST GENTLEMAN. I enjoyed THE MOVIEGOER, but this seems like a rewrite. I wonder whether Percy, greatly praised, may not have been praised ONLY FOR AMUSING ENGLISH PROFESSORS, A BREED I KNOW WELL AND DO NOT LOVE."
3,"a lot of good stuff, but a lot of fluff","Well, I read the Last Gentleman and I can most certainly say I see Percy's point. But it sure seems as if Percy threw in a lot of extra junk in the book, almost as if to lengthen the book. I liked the exploration of Will's character too, but the way that Percy did it could have been more subtle, instead of just jumping into will's thoughts. the book is not fluid, and a lot of times you might wonder what a certain page has to do with anything. Three stars- I liked it, but I didn't love it, though I realize there is stuff to love in this book."
2,The Last Percy Novel For Me? Maybe.,"Ok, ok, ok this is one of those books that has been hyped by a ton of people for an age. Why? Well, because many of these people claim that the book is a visionary commentary of the vapid state of modernity. It might be, but I want a book in which I can become lost for a short time. Not some deep window into another man's mental farts. That is all this book is, well maybe not. I mean, if you accept that actually reading this book has as much point as most of the main character's doings then you might have some satire here. Since the author was making a point about how senseless modern life is and you just have got done reading a modern classic, this might be the case. Anyway, well-written drivel for anyone can be found in this book."
5,Like GBV? You'll love this VHS!,"This video is a spectacular look into the band in their hometown and on tour during the Under The Bushes/Under The Stars period, It is split into three parts first you get to see the boys being interviewed by various rock mags at shows and around their hometown, second piece has alot of live footage plus a hilarious show in Austin where idiots from a band called Picasso Trigger try to start a fight with them (ahhh kids) and the tape ends with five videos some of which are: I am a Scientist, Bulldog Skin, My Valuable Hunting Knife, Auditorium/Motor Away. If you want to know what these guys are/were like back in the mid Ninties this is a great perspective."
4,Watchable Western!,"Western Union is -in last instance- a tribute to the titanic efforts for installing the telegraphic wires along the Far West against all the odds.Vince Shaw is the fatalist character who has to overcome the primary sin and finally must make justice to his obwn. He is the outlaw of the film, the looser who once has captured the love has to reject it.Good cast and fine direction."
4,DVD Western Union,This is a very good movie. But lately Amazon's Prices have gone up.If I were you I would try and find this movie somewhere else that is cheaper.
3,Randolph Scott's Breakthrough Western,"Director Fritz Lang's attention to historic and human details play an integral role in ""Western Union"" - a fictitious account of the telegraph line's evolution in the 1860s. Generally acknowledged as the first epic-scale Western in color, the 1941 Fox production is a rather conventional Hollywood endeavor. Despite the excessive comic relief and overemphasis on romance, the German filmmaker incorporates some of his fatalistic vision into the proceedings - embodied by Randolph Scott's tragic characterization. Lang's individual shadings add moments of realism to what could have been an overblown Cecil B. DeMille-type spectacle. ""Western Union"" remains an important film in its breakthrough casting of Scott, whose dark qualities would be further explored in his collaborations with writer-director Budd Boetticher."
4,Not as large as I'd hoped,"This mocrowave bacon cooker works great, but I wish it were about an inch larger all around. The bacon I use is much longer than the bacon pictured, even after cooking, so I need the extra room. Otherwise, though, a good find."
1,Junk,"When I opened the package I noticed that the tray only had three side walls. After looking in the box some I found the fourth, it had broken off during shipping. So at first I was going to send it back and see if they could replace it, thinking that it was broke during shipping. I picked up the tray and just to see how much force had to be applied before it broke I tried to bend it. I was able to further break it by hand three more times with little to no effort. At that point I just wrote this off as a $12 learning experience and will never by a product from this manufacturer again."
5,I love this bacon cooker!,"I ordered two of these bacon cookers. They are great. When I got these, I was using the round ones that I had bought around 19 years ago. They really lasted well; however, I like these rectangular ones better. Needless to say, the round ones were tossed in the garbage. I highly recommend this bacon cooker."
4,Works but big.,This is what I was looking for but its pretty big and you will have to stop the inner rotating plate from operating while using this to make bacon. Other than that it works great.
1,Dont waste your time!!,"This product does not cook bacon better than the George Foreman grill. If you want great, crisp bacon, get a George Foreman!!"
2,Not large enough!,"Not nearly large enough!!! I had one that was about 14'' by 12'' and it was perfect, lasted over 30 years. I was hoping this was the same but I didn't read the fine print. I will keep looking."
1,Does not rotate and burns,"The bacon lays great on the pan, BUT because it cannot rotate in the microwave the middle section of each piece of bacon burns. Threw it in the garbage and purchased a round dish"
