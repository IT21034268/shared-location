5,Diverse and super cool!,"I stumbled upon aromar bar when I heard the track little brother in Ireland. Figured I would give them a shot, it was like being hit in the face with super coolness. They do a great job of blending sexy down tempo tunes, with upbeat two step and pop. Great tunes for the dancefloor, wine party, even the bedroom if you have seduction on the mind. I highly recommend, happy tunes!"
3,Fila Fitness Sneaker,"The product arrived on time.Packaging was over all good, no marks or anything of shoes.If you are low on money i would recommend these, however if you have a wider foot it will be of less comfort."
5,What a funny man!!,"I'm not sure what I enjoy more... hearing Mark sing, or hearing his jokes and stories. He is a very talented man. I have enjoyed this album immensely.. particularly ""Living For Deep Fried Okra"". I almost wrecked my car when I heard that one!"
3,Robot nostalgia,I am a collector of old technical animation nostalgia. Tobor the Eight man was one of my favorites from the 1960's. It is probably too low tech and corny for the viewer of today. It does have some adult impact but today would not be politically correct.
1,VERY BADLY RECORDED!,There's so much hissing sound I donno how the record label can claim it's digitally restored. What an insult to digital technology. Singing is good but the LOUD HISSING throughout the album is absolutely unacceptable!
5,Great product it is a genuine Trijicon,"The product description didn't specify the manufacturer, but the sight is a genuine Trijicon and includes a 4 point and 5 point sight tool and an extended detent. When replacing your stock front sight post it is important to use the longer front sight detent that is included with the sight. This will allow the two pieces of the sight to lock into position. It isn't necessary to buy a sight tool as it is included with the Trijicon sight.If you are into 3 gun shoots, or night shoots, (I'm lucky my local range has both) then will want a tritium front sight post on your back up iron sights. This product fits the bill. Make it part of your Zombie plan!!!!"
4,Slow start but gets much better.,"This book has more ""sex"" scenes than any Suzanne's historical romance books, and it's understandable why. However, all the way through half the book, I was still waiting for suspense to begin, and for action to start. The first book ""Flirting With Danger"" was more fast paced than this one. It's is still a great book, and the author does not disappoint with witty, funny dialogs, steamy bedroom (and not bedroom) sex scenes, suspence and action.I was reluctant to even buy Suzanne's first contemporary title, but I'm so glad I gave her a chance. She is absolutely great at modern romance!"
4,A good addition to the series...,"This series was recommended to me because I enjoy the In Death series by JD Robb (Nora Roberts). This series is similar, but doesn't have the same depth or skill in characterization as Robb's series. Don't Look Down wasn't quite as good a read as the first book in the series. The plot seemed to drag more and didn't hold my attention as well. I think that the hero is a little too angsty for me, too. Throughout the book, he has to be careful what he says and does in order to not scare off the heroine (he's more invested in their relationship than she is - or more than she admits she is). This theme got a little repetitive. I guess I prefer a little more ""alpha"" in my heroes after a point. That said, I enjoyed it enough to recommend it to those who want to continue with the series. (It rated more toward a 3.5, but I rounded it up.) If you want something grittier, more intense, check out the In Death series by JD Robb (starting with Naked in Death)."
2,It was okay I suppose...,"Perhaps I should have read the first book in this series first because while it stood on its own reasonably well, the relationship between Sam and Rick didn't work for me. I just found the two of them to be so annoying. I wanted Sam to be funky and spicy and all she really did was just conform to Rick's ideals. I found myself wanting them to have a massive fight and for Sam to resort back to her old ways.Tough luck for me because it was a typical happy ending.It was an okay book. It took me forever to read. But I got there eventually."
3,Romatic Suspense without the suspense,"I really liked the first book in this series, Flirting With Danger. This sequel felt like it was more about the ""romance"" and she forgot about the ""suspense."" The whodunit was not a surprise and there wasn't much of a mystery getting to the conclusion."
2,LOTS of Profanity,"Romance purists should beware. This author seems to confuse modern romance with the need for excessive amounts of profane language. Apparently, it is not possible to be extremely wealthy, extremely gorgeous, and extremely attracted without being extremely filthy-mouthed. I don't happen to agree with that assessment [in fact, enjoyment of the romance dies for me], but the author does apparently believe it with all her heart. So, if you purchase any of her so-called 'contemporary' novels, be warned to endure dozens of ""f""-words, etc. It appears the only way such people can be understood."
5,Bang!,Without a doubt one of the best anime series of all times. Every episode is worth watching again and again. Ed's unconventional cuteness alone is worth buying this set. You get sad that the series is ending three or four episodes before the last. And thank goodness for an ending that wasn't spawned by traditionalist thinking. One of my all time favorites.
5,One of the Best,"This has to be one of the best anime series, ever. A must see for anime and non anime fans alike. This box set collects the entire series on one place, great for marathon viewing. It has some cool extras on the discs as well.Great story, animation, and a cool jazzy soundtack make this one set that should be in every fans collection."
5,Still good over a decade later,"Cowboy Bebop is an excellent series that almost anyone can enjoy. I've seen the entire series a few times before and am thoroughly enjoying watching it again. The 5.1 surround remix makes this version all the more enjoyable, and this is an excellent price, especially for anime. I can easily recommend this series to just about anyone."
5,Best Anime,"This is hands down my favorite anime. The characters are all interesting, the story lines are great, and the music is wonderful. I've been using an old version that a friend downloaded from somewhere, and the picture was horribly grainy and the music was distant and scratchy. It's so cool to finally have a better version."
5,AS advertised,The dvd came perfectly packaged easily opened no flaws great buy would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series...Kinda wish the english voices had more extra features
5,Best anime ever.,"This is by far my favorite anime ever. If you like space, anime, or anything to do with bounty hunters and guns this is for you. Check it out! You won't be disappointed!"
5,SCORE!,"Cowboy Bebop fans rejoice! Finally the entire thing in one affordable box! Of course you still have to buy the movie as well in order to REALLY complete the set, but it's a good cheap way to get all the sessions without having to buy them individually or spend $100+ for the entire set.Enjoy the Mushroom Samba!"
2,DVD product defective,"Although the surface of the DVD looks new, the quality of the video is poor regardless of the player it is played in. Couldn't get a replacement versus refund. Producer needs to do quality control."
5,FINALLY!,"It's about freakin' time Bandai came out with a DVD set that people could actually buy; for a moment I thought I was going to have to buy a bootleg. (Which is a big no-no, kids.)Anyway, I'm definitely not the first one to say this, but Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime series ever. The story never is never boring, the animation is excellent, and it has a fantastic soundtrack. A definite must-have."
5,"One of the best, even better.","Cowboy Bebop is certainly one of the best shows out there. A space western, it combines near-future sci-fi with slice of life to create a fulfilling adventure that not only entraps your consciousness, but also brings subtle truths of life to your realization.An excellent soundtrack and graphic overhaul make this one of the most kickin' pieces ever. Easily a favorite, it's 11 hours of intensive entertainment.(Don't let the ""Remix"" in the name fool you: it's the same classic Bebop.)"
1,Beware - These Canisters are not Airtight as Claimed,"The box reads ""Airtight"" but they are not even close. When I filled the canister with water and turned it over, the water poured out until the lid fell off. The space between the canister and the lid is large enough to pour small-grain rice or cous cous - and certainly flour, ground coffee and other dry goods.I had purchased these after discovering moths in some of our dry goods and these canisters will not prevent insects or humidity from accessing the items inside. After contacting Cooking.com they offered to pay for the return shipping."
1,Terrible,"This isnt even close to airtight, the metal lid just sits on top with a plastic spacer (not snapping or anything just sits there with wide open gaps). Returning and getting a different type. I bought this after reading reviews and not seeing much bad about this one but be warned, its not even close to being airtight."
2,"After 1 month, little improvement","I had heard many good things about this product and thought that maybe it would be worth the $$$'s. But after taking it one month, I haven't had much pain relief or improved stability. In fact, the arthritis in my knee flared up badly a week and a half ago. Could have been a seasonal thing. I continue to take Phosoplex and will do so for another month until my supply runs out. Then I'll see if I'll order it again. Regarding the stomach upset issue: When I take the four big capsules before breakfast, I have no problems if I have some milk with breakfast. Otherwise, it's difficult to keep the capsules and my breakfast down."
5,No mor hip pain,"In January '07 I began having left hip joint pain. I couldn't sleep on my left side and even during the day I felt it. It didn't stop me from walking or doing anything that I wanted to do, but it was annoying and troubling and it didn't go away. About June'07 I started taking Phosoplex regularly. Last month, February '08, I noticed that my hip pain was gone. I don't know exactly when it stopped hurting, but the pain is gone and I feel great."
5,exciting thriller with a Navy SEAL hero.,"Ward Carroll's new series about Navy SEAL Ash Roberts has started with a bang with The Aide. Fresh from a mission in Iraq where a mysterious incident occurred, Roberts is abruptly assigned to an admiral's staff at the Pentegon. While Robert's attempts to find out more info about the mysterious incident produces no results, he is informed that his comrades on the mission are dying. Meanwhile, the admiral's activities do not exactly seem ethical. With a blend of action, adventure and humor, Carroll writes a thriller that showcases the lives of the U.S. military."
3,Not enough Leisure,"Yes...the babes are hot...but the game is not.The graphics are supurb...but the adventure is not.Lots of repetition. Playing ""Quarters"", mixing drinks, dancing, & trampoline contests get dull after awhile.Mindless conversations with the babes that are sometimes too hard to win.Could have been better."
3,BUY THE UNCUT UNCENSORED VERSION!!,"The uncut uncensored version is 10 times better than this one. Having them curse and swear and showing CGI boobies, need to go with the uncut version for the total LSL experience... uncut version is by far 5 stars!!"
2,A Game of Mini-Games,"The old Leisure Suit Larry games were inventive, testing what society would accept in terms of a game. The sex-oriented humor was the main staple of course, coupled with an adventure styled game. Magna Cum Laude has none of the adventuring, and the humor is far less subtle or inventive. The game is made up of several mini-games, and while they are mildly entertaining for about 15 minutes, they do not a Leisure Suit Larry game make. Sierra should be ashamed of itself. On top of that, now they want to release an ""uncut and uncensored"" version. Who are they kidding? Most of the options are in plain text files."
1,Very bad.,"Sierra brought us many wonderful titles over the years, including the Kings Quest, Hero's Quest, Police Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry serials. In most cases, they did a good job putting together creative, cute, situation driven puzzle games. Here, they delivered an appalling blend of poor graphics, bad language, and simplistic game play.Gone are interaction with characters, puzzles, and good writing. Instead, one plays simple 2-D mini-games and views poorly developed cut-scenes.The game is a bizarre blend of exceptionally childish ""humor,"" such as fart jokes and random acts of not-very-clever profanity, coupled with 4 or 5 mini-games so shoddy and simplistic they recall the days of CGA. Too simple for those over 10, too profane for those under 16, this game would not be worth playing if it were free. At $50, Sierra sells their reputation and little else. I will think twice, and read some reviews, before purchasing another Sierra product."
2,An Insult To That Which Was Larry,"If you are looking at this game because you enjoyed the original LSL series, know that this is not in the same calibur. The games are simple and repetitive. Certainly not the complex and amusing puzzles of the original. Some of the mini-story lines are amusing but overall it is not that original or entertaining."
2,Gets boring after the novelty.,"I admit I played LL1 and 2 from a friend when they first came out decades ago. However, LL:MCL falls short of imagination. Instead we get a far more sophisticated LL character beyond his supposed age with touted 90,000 lines of dialogue, and far more crudeness and now gay bars. Most of the girls are airheads or psychos, too young for their own good, and having a LL game in college just doesn't seem in line with LL's traditional adult storylines. Overall it gives younger players the wrong impression of LL. LL wasn't trying to score as much as possible, he was on an eternal quest to find a real relationship. Like another reviewer said, it feels more like a ""volleyball bod"" game. That and the drunken mini-games become impossible to play after while. the 3D world seemed too compressed as well."
4,You will bust a gut...,"as many others have said, the mini games will get dry after playing them so many times.. eventually you will start to master the game of quarters and figure out ways to get out... now for all those who have played LSL8, i know that i was sore that Larry Laffer was not the main character and Al Lowe was also missing.... however sierra did do a good job on this game in terms of awesome graphics, gameplay, and nudity. (btw you can hex the file to unlock nude mode early in the game)... it is well worth the 30 bucks compared to the newer games out there and i would reccommend this game.. even my g/f made her own save and started playing.. she busted a gut laughing on the jokes because she never played a LSL game..."
3,disappointing for full admission price,"I don't love it, I don't hate it but I don't want it. It doesn't suck but I miss the narator of old and just the old feel of the game. This game is good for a few perverted laughs but might be better getting second hand at half the price. That would be your moneys worth."
1,Take care for the costs,"I bought this game and I had to call for technical support because it was not working and first thing I discover I need a new video card because if you don't have a card that support lighting it will not work, this is not fair because it's not specify when you purchase the game..."
1,Gets boring 10% into the game,"The charm of the previous LSL games is completely gone. The ""humor"" is extremely lame, forget about the witty humor in the previous series.Plus the way you advance is by playing minigames. This wouldn't be all that bad ( well it's nothing like the original where you are directly making decisions affecting the story) but you have to play the same mini games over and over and over again. And these are stupid games that can be programmed on a TI-83 calculator.Biggest waste of money on a video game....This isn't my LSL.. this is a cheap knockoff.I'm 24 yrs old."
3,Lacking,"First off for clarification: There is -NO- sex in this game, the most daring thing is full frontal nudity. Unlocking all the extras and stuff just unlocks nudity and puzzles.The game is lacking on all levels. The puzzles are too simple and shallow, and the commentary is boring. The older ones where more interesting, but I never much liked them ether.By the way nudity is the only difference between the regular and uncut versions."
1,Where's Al Lowe?,"I notice that there's no mention of Al Lowe anywhere from Sierra. Here's the simple truth - if the genius creator of LSL's 1 - 6 is missing, then this isn't an LSL game at all - just a cheap rip off.Message to pointy-haired bosses at Sierra: You can buy the LSL concept. You can buy Larry's image. But if you don't have Al Lowe, you don't have anything."
1,Christ almighty...,"Who are these people who review and praise a game that hasn't even come out yet! Yeesh.The reviewer below says that it should be as good as the previous Larry games well there's something you should know.The Leisure Suit Larry series was created by Al Lowe who made every title until he and hundreds others were fired by Sierra.Al Lowe had NO contribution to this title, (Even though Sierra said he would be involved!) this title is the concotion of a third party developer who have never made an adventure game in their life. From previews I've heard the game is alright but it's obvious that is hasn't got the distanct influence Al Lowe gave his games to make them personal and fun. Another critcism I heard is that it relies too much on nostalgia.For what it's worth, I'm not getting the game until Al Lowe gives his apporval. I'd advise fans do the same, but please don't praise a game you haven't played yet...Or is this guy below me a marketing goon?"
4,From a now college student who grew up on the original games,"As a teenager I would play the original Leisure Suit Larry games (all of them) and I loved them. Then I saw this. I couldn't believe it. A LSL game in college!!! I love how much this game shows what college is really about. The graphics are great, and the mini-games are fun, especially the beer pong :)PARENTS BEWARE: If you have kids that live away for college, you might want to pass on this one. It'll make you want to pull your kids out of college!"
4,Funny but repetative,"The game has good dialogue and jokes but the game requires a few mini-games to be played over-and-over to succeed at any task. A big flaw is you look more at a mini-game (directing your swimming sperm around conversation obstacles) during dialogue than watching the animation. That same game can be used for entertainment because hitting certain obstacles can lead to a very funny conversation. It's much like to LSL's of the past but with better graphics. I'd give it 7 out of 10, fun but can be annoying."
3,"Ohh Larry, your blood dint get to your nephew...","I played Larry Laffer back in the day... you would laught your heart out. You would f*** prostitutes, you would play pocker, you would help girl get liposucktions... it was all out fun. But this game lacks that fun factor... you can easily pass a few hours on it but its just not the same... the jokes are not that funny as the old ones... the adventures arent that challenging or funny either... I mean you want a game to entertain you for 5 hours tops... buy it... but DONT EXPECT LARRY LAFFER... this is just plain larry lovage a kid with a boring life who will never amount to his uncle's character charisma"
2,not as useful as I hoped,"I really wanted a more hands-on guide to everything about your first home, & this is too vague & lacking relevant details. It's a decent overview of broad, general topics new homeowner's should consider, but it's not the kind of reference book I'll use over & over."
5,The Greatest Mechwar with lots of different Mechs.,"Captian Paul Masters, of the House of Marik, knows well the art of BattleMech combat. When he's sent to evaluate a war on a backwater planet,he doesn't find what he expects. He finds a geurrella war, where the GFL try to deprive the True Belivers of their resources by any means possible. Their is no honor in this war. Your only Allies our anonymous. It's fighting a war that's really dirty."
4,The Fog of War,"I have been a Battletech a fan for quite a few years, and have recently begun to rebuild my collections of novels. Truth be told as it has been years since I read the books it is like my first read. Simply put, Christopher Kubasic has taken one of the more notorious conflicts in American history and thrust it's savagery into a future where the concept of Honorable combat is being reborn. The idea of the guerilla fighter still being able to bring an armoured combatant to a halt is disturbing, not because of the damage done to the machine but because of the toll on the man inside."
2,Knights of the Round Table Meets Vietnam,"The feelings I got from this book was far too much one of trying to to two very different things. The idea of the Knights of the Inner Sphere being founded in the beginning works well. However, the rest of the novel is very much a ""Vietnam War in Space."" It's quite annoying, and begins even before the story. A dirty internal war yes, but my lord, did it have to be TELEGRAPHED in the dedication?On the other hand, the protagonist is portrayed as a whiny twit in the later ""Twilight of the Clans"" books."
5,Two great flicks for one low price!,"This is a pretty standard bundle blu-ray. Don't expect much of an upswing in quality if you already own the dvds. But, to my mind, this is being unfair, considering the age of the films and the two-for-one price.Let's face it... you either love these movies as they are (and really... if you're not crying at the end of PM, or laughing at the end of tWoE, you've got problems) or you don't. For this price, it's a steal."
3,"Okay, but no special features","Blu-ray disk was okay with good resolution, but there was no special features for either movie. I guess this is normally the case for these double feature disks."
5,Best Wodehouse book I've read,"In my opinion, this is the best of Wodehouse, and I was pretty surprised at it."
5,Wodehouse at his very Best,"Psmith and Lord Emsworth together. What more can a Wodehouse fan want? The novel has everything that a Wodehouse lover yearns for. Lots of hilarious impersonations, the antics of the absent minded Lord Emsworth, the suavely nonpareil Psmith with his unique way of speaking, multiple impersonators wanting to steal the same thing from Blandings castle, the plight of Baxter....everything is there. This must be the most enthralling Wodehouse book I have ever read, though it is very difficult to choose the best. I read it for the first time when I was sixteen and through the years that have followed I have reread it a dozen times cover to cover and have enjoyed it as much or even more with every reading.And even if I don't read the whole book, whenever I hold the volume in my hand in a book shop or in a library or in someone's house, I read and re-read the place where Psmith proposes to Eve Halliday. That is simply sublime."
5,The P is silent,"Unquestionably Wodehouse in peak form. Any visit to Blandings Castle is a delight. Throw in Psmith and it's pure rapture. If you've never read Wodehouse before, it's a great introduction to the master. (If you're already a fan, then what are you waiting for?)"
3,"Good book, not great","This was my second Dennis Lehane novel, the first being Mystic River.It was a good book -- well written, good description, good character development. I thought at times the dialogue was a bit corny, and the middle of the story begins to drag a little. The revealing moment at the end -- who the killer is -- is only sub-par, and kind of transparent from the very beginning.One thing I'd seen other people say: the scene where Patrick Kenzie visits Alec Hardiman in jail... it was way too similar to Silence of the Lambs, from the scenary to the dialogue to the overall voice of Alec (it was a Hannibal Lecter rip). Anyway, it's a solid read, and I'll continue to read more Lehane novels. Just don't expect to be blown away."
3,not bad,"Before reading this book I read Shutter Island, which I really liked, especially the ending. I had pretty high hopes for this book. I enjoyed it somewhat but I found myself skippin some paragraphs for some reason. The characters were really awesome, especially Bubba. Even though he's a secondary character he really added up to the story and made it more interesting. Overall I give it 3.5 stars. I will def try to get my hands on more of Lehanes books."
3,Disappointed with this second read,"I really loved A Drink Before the War, but was very disappointed in this one. In fact, it was so depressing, I lost interest and never finished it. It's ok when things go bad once and awhile, but constantly, is too depressing a read to hold my interest. I was really looking forward to reading all of Dennis Lehane's books, because I do like his writing style."
5,Too Good for Words,"As others have stated, this book is the work of a true WRITER, not just a pop-novelist. Lehane succeeds on every level in this book: violence, love, comedy, friendship, you name it. I read a lot of books and Lehane's right now are the best to me. Try it and you'll see what I mean."
5,A work of art!,"After reading the first novel, A Drink Before War I thought I just found My new favorite author. After finishing Darkness.. I was sure! It was amazing!!!!!I finished it in two days and now I'm going to buy all the rest of the books. The story line,the characters. It's all awesome!I could not put this book down. If you want to read a great author this is the one. Kudos to you DL!!!!!!!"
5,"Excellent thriller, well-drawn characters","This is the first novel by Lehane that I've read, and it's one of the best novels I've read this year. A solid thriller (though, be warned, not for the squeamish) about murder, a serial killer, two Boston private eyes, and the past histories that tie it all together, is wonderfully written. You feel what these characters feel; their pain, their memories, their longings...Lehane is a writer to watch, and I'll be seeking out the rest of the novels in this series! Highly Recommended."
4,"Good writing, brutal content",Lehane writes well. Characters are developed well enough you can picture yourself meeting them. He does this without long intrusive narrative so I cannot fault his skill. The mystery is also a good plot.I don't care so much for the graphic brutality of his writing. Perhaps I'm squeamish. I think he could write just as good a story with a bit less of the gore.
4,"Darkness, Take My Hand","Dennis Lehanes's thriller is a great story that will keep you up at night, an not just to finish reading! A superb cast of characters, and an absorbing plot make for terrific reading. One not to miss!"
4,Only one problem.,"I just finished this book and let me tell you, if you are lover of thrilling books then this is the one for you. The story is well written and Lehane writes just as good as any other of his books. I just read Shutter Island so I decided to try this next and in my opinion this is much better. My only issue is that the Kindle does not have the first book to the series so i don't know how Kenzie and Angie became who they are. Now its time to read the next one in the series, Sacred."
5,Loved it!,"I read this book for a book club not knowing anything about the author before. Then upon finishing realized he was the author of Mystic River and Gone, Baby, Gone. I absolutely love his writing style when I'm in the mood for an excellent murder mystery to lose myself in. Much better than James Patterson and I have been reading him for years..."
4,"It's so close to five stars, but","one of the characters is so terrible. I don't understand the allure of Angie Gennaro. She is so perfect, apparently, that whenever she leaves the room - which seems to happen so often it might be a plot device - other characters simply have to gush to Kenzie about how great she is. She seems a little rude, self-centered, and co-dependent but who wouldn't be if one was so lucky to be absolutely perfect.Other than that the book is great. I think the types of mysteries that Lehane writes - dark, brooding, complex, and psychological - are my favorites. He doesn't explain to much - except about Angie's perfectness - and it feels like you're getting a glimpse into the criminal world that's far more fascinating than having everything neatly explained and packaged."
4,Took a Chance and liked it!!,"This was my first DL. It was a good suspense story and the scene with the enforcer describing how he ""jumed on a man's back in order to break his spine"" still bothers me."
2,"A depressing, very unpleasant page-turner","The primary purpose of my review is to echo the review provided by C-C-Peterson. I, too, started with the first novel in this series, and found the violence in that novel to be excessive, but appropriate to the overall plot. However, the gore, sadism, and the time spent being dragged through the muck of human evil in this second novel left me repulsed and gloomy. The killers in this novel are evil personified, and if the author is to be credited with anything, it is that he accurately portrays what might happen to those who survive such an encounter. I felt a little like that myself when I finished the book. I read noir for entertainment, but I think I stumbled into something darker than noir. I finished the book to be sure they got the bad guys and that they would all die; I think I stayed engaged for much the same reason people stare at an accident on the highway."
4,Read Them in Order!,"This book was ruined a little bit for me because I figured out who did it very early on. I thought, ""How on earth could I possibly know already!?"" Then I realized... Patrick himself told me when I'd read Gone Baby Gone weeks earlier. I still read it and I enjoyed it very much, but it would have been nice to not know. I really wish Lehane would continue this series. It doesn't look likely, does it? But buy all 5, and read them in order. Excellent series with great character development."
2,Not as good as I had hoped.,"I don't really know where Lehane got his reputation as a great author. I thought the characters were two dimensional, the mystery not very mysterious, and the scary parts not very scary."
5,Second book is one of the best...,"The second book in the Kenzie/Gennero (don'tcha just love those last names?) appears to be, in my opinion, one of the best in the series.It explores more of Patrick's past, and as well as his neighborhood's. It also explores, in great (and almost disturbing) depth, the phyche of a madman and his motives.Great book. I pretty much now try to base all my thriller writings on the workings of this book. Good job, Dennis.-Jack"
5,a great novel,Dennis Lehane shows that you can have more than 1 hit in a series. Theis book was amazing it put togather old friends and new enemys unlike moast thriller novels it was not predictable and the outcome will suprise you. You'll find out things about the characters you didn't know in the previous one. Once you start you can't put it down.
4,Another great book by Lehane,"I was very impressed with Lehane's first book, A Drink Before the War, and was very excited to try his next book, Darkness Take My Hand. His stories just keep getting better and more enthralling. I love the two main characters and the way they interact- they're a great team. And boy is this plot enthralling. The serial killer story is really scary though- I found this book really hard to put down! I reccommend it to any mystery and suspense lovers!"
5,AHHH- I wish it wasn't over,"Oh man this is one good read! I can't believe that I didn't know about Patrick and Angie earlier. I am an avid reader and only heard of Dennis Lehane's series last month. I have read ""A Drink Before the War"" and now ""Darkness, Take My Hand"" in the past week. I was late to work on Sunday because I couldn't put ""Darkness"" down. Oh I love the characters. How wonderfully human they are. So full of fault and virtue. The story is dark, moody and riveting. It moves at a fast pace. Almost too fast since I was sad that it was over."
2,Too over the top.,seems to me that all the characters were psycho killers who had no social values. The cell of serial killers came out of an unlikely event thirty years ago.
2,Also disappointed,I have to agree with other reviewers who were disappointed. This is the last of DL's books for me. By that I mean I have read them all now. I left this one for last because I knew it was going to be dark and involve serial killers. Dark is one thing. This book is gruesome and horrible. Yet pretty ridiculous in many parts. We know there are at least two killers coming for our heroes yet we put one lone cop to guard them out in the street. We all know the electricity is off but we don't wonder if the killers are going to get through the electrically locked door? The two detectives are slow witted as are the police and the FBI. I think I could do a better job protecting them. And that endind scene - so far from reality- the bad guy swinging an infant around. Just to much. Compared to his other books I consider this one to be a loser. Pass it up for Sacred or one of his better books.
4,A real page turner,"This is a worthy follow up to the first book, with a gripping stand alone story complemented by additional back story on the principals. Patrick Kenzie is portrayed as an 'Everyman with skills' and has a very distinctive and interesting voice."
5,Outstanding,"Kenzie and Gennaro are back, and so is lehane with this masterblaster of a book. Brutally realistic action, the wriest of wry humor, and next-door characters makes this book a surefire hit."
5,best of a great series,"I do not hand out many 5 star ratings. They should be reserved for books of unusual stature like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD or FIFTH BUSINESS. But Lehane has written a dark and horrific masterpiece. He is indeed a deep and thoughtful author. Every mood and emotion is pitch perfect. Lehane has created not just memorable characters that give short term excitement, but rich compelling characters that speak to universal experiences. Lehane makes us think as we read, which is no easy task in popular fiction. Themes of honor, betrayal,fear, and vengeance are explored in an uncomfortable way. (and thats a good thing) To see how far a 'hero' will go for the greater good is indeed interesting and our hero does questionable things before he sees what the darkness will require of him. This a must read."
5,Stayed Up All Night!!!!!,"I read this book in a matter of two days. It was my first Dennis Lehane book and it certainly is not my last!!!! I actually happened to find this hardcover treasure at a book store on clearance, and I am so glad I did! The characters of Angie and Patrick are so real and their commraderie (spelling?)is what makes the story flow. I love the whole ""serial killer"" stories to begin with, and this one had my hair standing on end!! A must read for all mystery lovers. This is the new master of suspense!"
4,Darkness Take My Hand,"Lehane is able place the reader in the neighborhood I grew up in. I can see the streets, stores, and other buildings that he is writing about even if he change their names. Great reading and makes you not want to put the kindle down until you have finished the book.."
4,another good one.,"Ihave enjoyed following the personal & professional lives of kenzie & Gennerio, its fun to follow the development & subquent solving of the mystery."
3,Way overrated,"I was put off by the gratuitous and sadistic violence, the sloppy plotting, and the completely absurd omnipotence with which the villian is endowed toward the end. This is the hot new writer ? Buyer beware."
2,Extreme violence mars complicated second Kenzie & Gennaro tale,"We're not usually contrarians, especially when a book is very highly rated by both the public and by close reading friends, but Lehane's second in the Patrick Kenzie & Angela Gennaro set is so extremely violent, so twisted and dark that we were more anxious to finish just to get it over with rather than discover all the resolutions to the vicious action and closely concealed bad guy identities. A very complicated plot features the hunt for a duo or trio of serial killers, who remain active throughout the story to the point of nearly adding our protagonists to their long list of horribly grisly murders. And while there was some excellent probing of the issue of the violence Kenzie brought into the life of serious girlfriend Grace (and daughter Mae), as well as developments in the ongoing sexual tension between our two principals, we must forego the remainder of this set as just too over the top gory to suit us. Sorry `bout that."
2,Started Gamely - Ended Lamely,"I seem to be in the minority on this book. I started reading it with great hopes of discovering a new crime writer. But I found it too wordy, too graphically sexy, too psychopathic and too derivative. Based on my feelings about this novel, I don't think I'll try any of his other works."
5,Oustanding Baby Book Excellent For Adults,"Simple Natural Baby Food contains simple, easy to follow recipes. I picked the book up expecting soft, mushy, baby food, and found healthy delicious recipes enjoyable for the whole famioly. Check out the Banana-Oatmeal Cookies - YUM!!!"
1,Big disappointment,This book goes against everything my pediatrician and allergist recommend as far as introducing nuts to a child's diet. Half of the recipes call for nuts of some type for babies from ten months on. Everything I have heard from the Dr's or read says to wait at least one year and until two or three years if you have a family history of nut allergies. Very disappointed in this book.
4,Easy as pie! Nice book for a beginner!,"I really enjoyed reading this book and found it to be a very simple guide to really get going with baby food. I ordered Super Baby Food and Blender Baby Food at the same time, and was able to get started with baby food after reading the first few pages of this one. It's that easy to get into. Yes, order one of the bigger books if you want lots and lots of info, but if you just want a quick manual on how-to, this is a good book to get. The recipes are very very easy.My favorite recipes in here are the brown rice cereal (I make it all the time for my daughter) and the pear-applesauce, which is SO awesome, I steal my daughter's all the time out of the freezer when I need a sweet treat and finish off hers after she's done eating if she doesn't want any more!The only downside to this book is that some of the ingredients are a little weird, like sea vegetables, but if you're into health food, you'll love it."
3,A good collection but many aren't really recipes.,"I bought this book based largely on the great reviews, and while it does have a few recipes my son has enjoyed, it is a very slim book. I'm not kidding when I say it has a recipe for cinammon toast! Other ""recipes"" literally have three ingredients and the direction ""mash."" Now, I'm no gourmet chef, but I was looking for a little more-mainly sneaky ways to get my son to eat vegetables. I was hoping for recipes a little like those at the back of the ""What to Expect"" books. It does have some good ones,(great first birthday cake),just don't expect a thick volume."
5,LOVE IT!,"I will be buying this book for all of my pregnant friends! Unlike a few others who have reviewed this book, I did not feel like I was being preached to by the author. I found her informative and concise, which is exactly what I need as a first time mother of a 5 month old. Also, as has already been stated by other reviewers, if you want to use the suggested 'exotic' ingredients to obtain the full health benefits of these recipes, use the internet! Anything you could ever need is at your fingertips.I am very excited by this book, having already read it from cover to cover, and cannot wait to try the numerous, simple recipes at my disposal."
3,not bad,"I had bought this book because someone wrote here, it was too macrobiotic, but I dont agree.Some recipes needs improvement, but this booklet is a good start for healthy babyfood"
2,EsMummy,"I was disappointed with this book due to a) the lack of suggestions for first foods (and I have enough to do without making rice cereal myself), and b) some of the ingredients I also wouldnt know where to buy or what else to do with them. There are many more foods infants can eat when they're starting out than was suggested in this book.If you or your family are not solely whole foods eaters this might not be the book for you."
3,Very Basic Book,"This book teaches how to prepare the first meals all the way through toddler foods. I give it 3 stars because it does cover the information, but the same info can be found on the web for free. I would start at www.wholesomebabyfood.com and go from there. This book is certainly not going to teach you things you can't find elsewhere. Save your money."
2,Is this book on Cooking or Philosophy?,"Informative book, but.....I do not believe it is right to be teaching ""vegan"" or ""vegetarian"" dietary habits for people to practice on their infant children. Children are in need of so many things in their beginning years, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc. I bought this cookbook to learn how to make more natural and more healthy babyfood for our children. Not to learn how to avoid meat products and get a philosphy lesson on the principals of vegan and vegetarian diets.I am sure the author is very well educated, I am not questioning that, I just don't think we are on the same page. I also think that alot of the food ingredients are not available at the ""corner grocery store"" thus limiting the application of many of the recipes in our household."
2,Just okay unless you're pretty crunchy,"This book was good in that it gave me the confidence to just start throwing things in the food processor. However, if you are not that into health food you won't have heard of half of the ingredients it calls for. It's pretty organic and lots of things it calls for cannot be found at the average grocery store. If I had realized how ""crunchy"" this book was I would not have purchased it."
1,suit,this book is very complicated. it is not practical at all. annabelle karmal's books are way easier to follow. dont waste the money on this book
4,Some good ideas,"Like many reviewers, I'm not big on the organic, make-your-own-baby-food stuff either. But this book is very helpful if your child can't or won't eat dairy products. There are a lot of ideas and recipes for non-dairy sources of calcium.There were several recipes that my daughter liked when she was a year old but soon outgrew. Now at 2.5, when she is refusing to eat almost everything, there are still 3 recipes in here that she absolutely loves, and for those alone I'm very glad I bought this book. (The recipes she likes are vegetables with bread crumb topping, Almond Butter Noodles and nut butter chews. Even when she won't eat other vegetables, she'll gobble down broccoli with bread crumb topping and ask for seconds.)There are also some good recipes for healthy desserts (i.e. low sugar and even some nutritional content), which have been popular at family gatherings."
4,Great Baby Food Tips and Ideas,"This book gave me great tips and recipes. I especially like the tip about freezing extra food you make for baby in ice cube containers. I do this all the time now. They're easy to defrost, the ice cube tray size lets me take just the right portion for my baby 9just one or two cubes) and they're easy to defrost and feed to baby. I like the layout of this book and the easy recipes. One customer below says the recipes call for things she can't find in her town... well the author is not preaching, she just makes recommendations. You can get substitutes so skip the item. I like the book a lot."
5,Simply Yummy,"My kids have loved all of the recipes I have made from Simply Natural Babyfood. They gobble up apple muffins, carrot muffins, cheesy rice, and other dishes as quickly as I serve them. I no longer have to worry about whether or not they are getting enough fruits and vegetables. And the recipes are all easy to make, so not having enough time to prepare nutritional meals is not a factor."
5,Amazing Music,"This is truly amazing music.The first time I listened to this, I thought wow those horns are screaming at the high frequencies (treble area). After going through the CD a couple of times, I began listening to the intricacies of the music and rhythm, and it is amazing. A Night In Tunisia is a true classic that changed the scape of jazz (afro-cuban). It doesn't use a walking bass line, which is amazing. The high tempo rhythms on this CD mixed with the horn playing along with the bass make for just amazing music. It is amazing how well they fused two types of music to make such a masterpiece."
5,Top notch,"Anderson, editor of ""Seasoned Rogue"" magazine, has written a sound manual for the modern day rake. The tips are first rate and I may well follow his advice and wear a cravat as I stalk the craps tables prowling for spare."
5,A childhood memory,"This book was one that I remember from childhood - and the copy I had was my father's from his childhood. Geared toward young readers it has a little adventure, humor, and some history - though accuracy may be questionable! It is an old-fashioned story about a boy and girl growing up in rural Scotland long ago. Back when kids could disappear for a day without panic ensuing.It is part of a series that was very popular in the early part of the 20th century. I was really happy to see that it is still available."
1,Discs were better used as drink coasters!,"Perhaps my shortest review, but straight to the point. All three CD sets; Maximum 70's, Maximum 80's, and More maximum 80's, contain a pile of remixed material, not the original vinyl mixes from the period. Many of the tracks have extra techno beats added on from the 90's and 00's. The mastering of the discs is also flawed, as much of the material contains heavy mid and low range distortion, a result of over-peaking recording levels in the studio. All twelve cd's were better used as drink coasters, which is okay, as I do hold a party now and then at the radio station, and several at home."
5,Brought back good memories!!,"My dad, uncle, and grandfather all worked in this mine from about 1953 into the mid 1960's. We lived in Scheelite when I was very young, and then in Red Houses, and Rovana. I went to Round Valley Elementary school. It was a wonderful life..and this book brought back many wonderful happy memories, and made me wonder what happened to so many people I used to know!!!!!It is a good read for anyone..not just those of us who lived it!!!Theresa"
4,beautiful noise,"Shades of Autechre, Throbbing Gristle and Einsturzende Neubauten. Think of drum and bass made with machine noises. That's an approximation of Imminent Starvation's sound. Tracks like Tentack One are dancefloor destroyers. Others, like the phenomenal Ire, are crazed industrial drill-n-bass epics. Sure to be loved by Rythmic Noise fans and those who favour harder techno."
5,For Everybody...,"No matter how much you know, or how little, this is the book you have to read. Both of the authors know what they are talking about, explain in great detail what we know and how, don't talk down to you, don't go on tales of fantasy. They look at the fossil evidence, checking out the original material with their own eyes, and give us the facts, with a touch of imagination and humor."
5,Our Very Nature -,"The whole of paleoanthroplogy is mesmerizing to me. Without being a paleoanthropologist myself, I cannot offer a studied opinion of this work. I simply stand in awe at the scene which, Ian Tattersall and Jeffrey Schwartz have painted. Since this book is not a novel, I have no fear of revealing its ending... we, are the only surviving hominids! What drama of intolerance created this fate is elucidated by this mind blowing tome.b|b"
3,Copy Cats,"When those who love the inquire and quest for the actual orgin of human kind, they dig deep and write what others before them have discovered and think..however, maybe they all are wrong.How Many would love to READ a Fiction or Fact re. one possible origin maybe all have overlooked????????"
2,BEWARE OF WHERE YOU ORDER,"Last June 09 I ordered this item from Amazon. I notice today that they no longer offer this item directly. After waiting four months, during which time Amazon was very helpful by notifying me that they could not obtain the product for shipment, I took the ""cancel the order"" option Amazon offered me. At that time there was no other source offered on Amazon. I called Jessum directly, and they told me that the blank insert rings were in stock and would be happy to sell them to me. The price was slightly higher and there would be a ""small shipping charge"" of several dollars. I placed the order. The price I paid was $24.99 for the rings, and $17.68 for shipping!! To add insult to injury; Jessum is a Canadian company, and my credit card company charged me a ""foreign transaction fee""!! Win some, lose some. I have a Jessum lift, but I will never purchase another item from them."
1,Not for 360,"It's a nice enough headset, came in pretty quick, but the ad did not make it very clear that it wasn't for XBox 360, only for the original Xbox. Absolutely useless now.I repeat, NOT COMPATIBLE WITH XBOX 360!I guess I'll just have to use the mic with something else."
1,Caution: VERY FRAGILE,"""Fra-gee-lay. That must be Italian.""Although this is the standard headset for Xbox Live users, it's extremely fragile. The clip that holds the ear piece on easily broke off. I would recommending finding another headset that's one piece."
1,It sucks like crap (similar to my husband),"This product is absolutley not worth the money (again like my husband *but that mail order husband catalogue was so cheap*) it is flimsy and will break with ease (my husband *ahemmm*). Yes it can be fun with all that voice masking stuff, but it breaks apart so easily so it isn't worth the money. There is no point in getting it unless your willing to waste money on it or are increadbly bored with your students...I mean life. Is there any alternative? Well you could try looking for a stronger one one but when he has trouble lifting the chair.....I mean it has trouble holding together it truly is not a very good thing."
2,BREAKS TOO EASILY,"Man, online with people is cool. You need to for Rainbox Six, but, this unit breaks sooo fast and easily. The little part where you snap it the microphone onto the headset is very, very, very fragile. If you snap it, which you will, i suggest using superglue to put it back on. Even this won't keep it together for to long though. The makes of this product, X Box obviously, need to DEFINITELY go back to the drawing board. It's just way too weak. Too bad the cheaper stuff stinks with the sound."
4,Definetly NOT worth $30.00.,"Okay, well first off this product was very cheaply manufactured. So unless you're extremely careful it'll most likely brake on you. Another thing I noticed is that whenever I play online I always get 'dude, your mic is lagging' or 'fix your headset' from my fellow online gamers. Then I have to unplugg it and blow on it for it to work better. In my opinion you're better off buying a third-party headset because the XBox one is very cheaply manufactured. Definetly NOT worth $30.00."
1,Fragile,"The clip that attaches the earpiece to the headband just broke on mine after dropping it on the carpet...Same thing happened to a family members. Sure, it's stylish, but go with an alternative."
4,Xbox Headset,"This product is good for a while until the connecter breaks and then some people go out and buy another headset and other people use glue and tape, but all i do is take the communicater part that broke off and slide it under the left ear (the actual thing that goes around your head) and then snap it back in place. Yea, it doesn't stay on your head great, but it does work and thats the way I use it. The only thing that I found that I dont like is that the communicater goes bad after a while. First I have to adjust the cord just right and then after a month of that, it doesn't work anymore. This is a good headset for about 6 months till the connection finally breaks"
3,This is a pretty good until the piece of plastic breaks making it junk!!,"First, I take very good care of all my XBOX equipmentSecond, Although I had no problem with it for nearly 4 months the INFAMOUS PIECE OF PLASTIC finally broke.Third, Honestly, it's not worth $30 dollars to have this break so quickly.Fourth, I have not tried any other XBOX headsets but I certainly will."
1,it's crap,"i read a review of 1 guy having 3 broken ones. about a week ago i broke my third headset... i was so disgusted. I took good care of it, but the little plastic piece that everyone talks about finally broke. Everything about this headset is perfect except for 2 things. 1: some of the headsets have weak hold on where the microphone holds up. This means every time you put on this headset you might have to adjust it... and it's annoying because it's a loose adjust. 2: The infamous piece of plastic that everyone who has a broken headset knows about. It's a console headset yet they make it like it's on your computer desktop. Screw you, microsoft! 30 dollars for this piece of junk. I had to put a screw in my other 2 headsets now they work great.If you get this headset, take good care of it. Leave it in the SAME SPOT every single time you put down your controller. That's the only way you're going to keep it alive for more than a year. Know where it is at all times."
2,"Nice Headset, but needs improvement","Well, this headset looks cool, but really, it's very cheap. Mine has not broken yet, but it is on the verge of breaking. As everyone else said, these are very fragile, and uncomfortable. The plastic is very flimsy. Sound quality is good, and it has a sound control too, so if someone is screaming, and you can't mute them at the moment, you can turn your volume down until you can mute him. The headset comes in three pieces, the microphone and speaker, headgear, and Headset to controller connecter (which looks sort of like a memory card). I would recommend you buy the Plantronics GameCon Halo 2 headset over this one, because it is more comfortable, and bit more durable. It surpasses this headset by far."
2,Breaks easily,"The headset broke in the same day my son received it. So I remember reading on here, that this may happen and to just purchase a good headset to go with the communicator, so we did. Bought a headset at Radio Shack, put them together and he was in business. So, half the product is great, the other half breaks like glass. Purchase only for the communicator."
3,DON'T BREAK IT!,"This is a really good mic, just that if you and try and take it off quickly a little piece of plastic will snap, there for ruining any way to repair it other than ghetto tape or glue(the glue might get in your hair) so...if you can properly take care of it, buy it, but i broke it 2 weeks in.."
5,X Box,This was a great item. My son loves to use it while playing on his x box. It is very convient to have hands free game playing. I would difinitely recomend this item
3,A little flimsy,It works fine enough but the plastic piece is prone to break which makes it a pain in the ass to wear. This probably doesn't matter much now considering this is dated technology.
5,book reviev,"I found this book an excellent read,with many intresting and varied topics on rocks and stuff.The only problem with it was the absense of naked women and the use of words of more than one cylable,many of which i neither understood or could pronance. On the whole an exciting read with many plot twists and a suprise ending involving a rabid dog and a jar of vaseline. I will definately recomend this book if,like me your are currently contained within a secure unit with only the padded walls and a rubber matress for company. I thank you and goodbye."
4,10 years and still going.,"I own the st Moritz version of this watch - exactly the same. I have gone through numerous straps and batteries. The carbon fiber strap was not that good. The alarm only lasted a few years before dying but the crystal face is fantastic - I use it as a work watch and it is still un scratched. The case has many very small scratches on it but nothing major. Lastly the glow in the dark is not that good at all and the date is hard to set, the screw is hard to find the right detent. All that being said I would not hesitate to buy another, if only for the reason that the face is super tough and it keeps good time."
5,A wonderful collection of adoption stories,This book is probably the most balanced collection of stories I've ever read about adoption from all different viewpoints. I love this book and highly recommend it to anyone touched by adoption.
2,I didn't get it,"As the grandmother of 3 adoptees, I was eager to get thisbook an was sorely disappointed. It did not give me anyinsights...........a lot of it I just could not relate to.I made myself read it through to the end, hoping thatI would find some thoughts that would connect me to thepoems, etc. Fortunately, my precious adoptees are allaware of their beginnings, know that God makes all children andis the glue that holds all families together."
1,Tries to be something she is not,"Jazz singers of the 1920s and thirties did not stretch every note out into 10 syllables like Christina does. I can't even listen to Aint No Other Man because she is literally screaming from beginning to end. She's got a great voice, she just doesn't know how to use it in a way that is pleasing to the ear..The ""oversinging"" was good on her first CD, but she began to do that annoying growly sound on Stripped and it continues on Back to Basics. It sounds like she tries to make her voice sound deeper than it really is, and it just comes off sounding like she has a huge wad of phlegm in her throat.The only two songs I like are ""Makes You Wanna Pray"" and ""Welcome""."
4,Nothing Basic About This Girl,"Ms. Aguilera is by far the best young vocalist out there today. I've been a fan of hers since she first came on the scene & I respect the fact that she's not afraid to take risks & do different things. Of course, when you can blow like she can, it's hard to make a lot of mistakes! I love that she pays homage to musical greats like Etta, Billie & Ella while putting a modern spin on things."
5,Taking current pop artists back to basics.,"Christina Aguilera's new album deserves high marks for its top notch quality of music. Her decision to work with ""Primo"" on numerous tracks on her album turns out a major success. Tracks such as ""On Our Way"", ""Understand"", and ""Without You"" are instant classics and will be listened to for decades to come. Artists like Christina transcend temporal boundaries. What a bonafide diva and artist she is. A talent like her comes once in a generation, and this album fully displays her potential."
5,Surprisingly Fantastic!,"I was never the biggest Christina fan, I liked the random pop hits but not the majority of her songs. Both cds are catchy, relaxing, chill, and groovey at the same time!! It was always known that Christina was talented, this album proves it!"
5,"From ""Dirrty"" days to a Cleaner Album","Now that Xtina has gotten married, she cleaned up her image and her songs. Now instead of the promiscuous songs and videos, she has a toned down album. No doubt that her voice is still strong and beatiful as always. Hurts is an especiall extraordinary song with amazing lyrics."
3,Paying Her Respect To those Who Came Before Her,"Over all, I think this album is a good album, her voice is What carries this album through. Dis one to me is the better of the two dis. I guess because of a more up tempo vibe. And as follows are the songs that high light the album as a whole for me. ""Ain't No Other Man"" ""Back In The Day"" ""On Our Way"" ""Understand"" ""Here To Stay"" ""Still Dirrty"". They are only two songs on dis two that try to keep dis two aflot and they are ""Candyman and ""The Right Man. The second dis for me, for the most part is depressing. Now,to me there were some tracks that needed to stay on the previous album stripped I mean that was then, this is now you made your point now let's move on. Like with the song ""Without You"" and even with the song ""Still Dirrty"". But,to me her most impotant song is ""Oh Mother"" because it address domestic violence. And I know that MS. Aguilera though her music she has helped many and will continue to do so through her gift of song."
4,"Great Production, Lyrics and Vocals","First of all, I'm not actually 13. When I first heard this album, I was unsure of it. Then, the more I listened to it the more I loved it(that's how most good albums are with me). The majority of the album is excellent, but I do feel there were a few unecessary album fillers(Slow Down Baby, Here To Stay). I must say that the girl can sing and I love how she takes risks with her music.All in all it was great!Top Songs(in no particular order)1.Understand- nice production2.Oh Mother- a nice simple song3.On Our Way- good production, good vocals4.Without You- I love this song!! Great Vocals and melody5.Welocome- GREAT production!6.Hurt- nice simple song7.Mercy On Me- by far the best overall song, amazing vocal performance and concept8.Save Me From Myself- a sweet,mellow song/ simple singing(which I love)9.Right Man- I like the vocal arrangement"
5,Simply Amazing!,"This album is honestly packed with some of the best music I have heard in a while. You can tell Christina put her heart and soul into this album and that she stayed true to herself. The lyrics are meaninful and the music is beautiful. Christina really is a true artist with the most powerful and amazing voice in my lifetime.The album is packed with it all from the sound of old blues and jazz with songs like ""I Got Trouble"" and ""Candyman"" to more old school Christina with songs like ""Still Dirrty"" and ""Slow Down Baby"". Honestly, you will love this album. It's packed with over 20 songs, and it's definitely worth the money. I cannot wait to see what she has in store for her tour. Baby Jane is on her way to becoming a legend. =)"
3,"Not bad, but ""Stripped"" is far better....","To hear that Christina was incoporating elements of 1920s jazz, soul and blues left me intrigued. I couldn't wait to check out the album. However, after a few thorough listens, I realize that this album is not as good as it was hyped to be. The songs worth listening to are ""Ain't No Other Man"", ""Understand"", ""Candyman"", ""Trouble"",""Hurt"", ""Enter the Circus"" and ""Welcome"".The rest are, well, contrived for me. Tepid at its best, boring and cheesy at its worst. Stripped remains the best album produced by Christina."
3,BTB Disappointment,Well.Until I got to track 16 to 23 I thought this a real Dud certainly not up to Christina's Amazing Vocal Ability and to think I waited so long for this release.I'm very disappointed Candyman I thought really cute one of the best tracks.Even Stripped was better than this and had a lot more real singing.16 to 23 was more to the hype she put on this album.
4,Still Growing As An Artist,"Honestly, I have only listened to 2/3 of the double album set, but I have enjoyed every minute of what I have heard. Christina is a little dynamo and she brings it full force. It is ashamed that so many of the tracks on this album will be lost in the over play of Candyman and Ain't No Other Man on the radio. If you like pop music, this is a great addition to the 2006/2007 year's collection."
4,Ear candy,This is a good cd..I LOVE aint no other man..4 stars beause there werent a lot of big ballods like i expected to hear from christina
3,"it's ok, but stripped was way better","I like both of Christina's previous released (especially Stripped) but this one is a little TOO different for my taste. I gave it 3 stars because i like probably about 8 songs off the entire album and most of them are from the first disc. In my opinion the 2nd disc is junk. The first one has some modern-ish songs on it but the second one is completely ""1930""..except maybe ""Still Dirrty"" which i do like that song. I think she has a really good voice and I normally like her music but I can't handle all the cheesy lyrics, extreme jazz stuff. Her video for ""Candyman"" is ridiculous. She makes herself look like a complete idiot in that video and the song is equally lame. She tries making it sexual but it just makes her sound like a wh*re. Anyway, hope she takes it forward about 70 years on her next album and quits trying to act like she was alive then..."
3,So so for Christina,I really was not impressed with this style of music on this CD. Not one of her better ones.
5,Fabulous CD,I am a Dance Teacher and she had a song I loved and needed. All the other tracks are Great as well. She is an awesome artist. Love her Voice!!!
1,Love Christina I Don't get this Album,"She is amazing and talented, there is no question about that. I am a huge fan of her both for her music and her as a person. I was so excited to hear the new album was finally out. I love ""Ain't no other man,"" so I was excited to hear what the rest of it sounded like. I don't get it. I listened to it and was like ""ehh, it's different."" Everything sounds the same and is more like a journal entry then a song. Unlike ""Stripped,"" it didn't feel like a journal entry that was made into a good song. It was missing the personal touch of that album. It felt like an attempt to make a themed album in a particular genre and just didn't feel like all the material even connected with her.""Candyman,"" sounds like a sample of ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,"" to me. Hopefully I'll like the remixes. Sorry to all the other xtina fans, I don't mean any harm."
3,THE MOST PREDICTABLE ALBUM EVER!,"After STRIPPED, we knew that Xtina's next album would also be a diferrent thing for her. And I knew that it was going to be in the 20's,30's style when I heard ""TILT YA HEAD BACK"" with Nelly in 2004.As it says; VERY PREDICTALBE album by our dirrty girl Christina, but then again a lovely flashback to the 30's era.I enjoyed the first half off the album, BUT! eventually I got tired from it! Christina gave us too much songs! She shoudl have picked 13 songs and make a PERFECT album, not an mediqucre as it is now!The tracks I would like to put out as ""the best"" are; AINT NO OTHER MAN,HURT,CANDYMAN,F.U.S.S.,SLOW DOWN BABY,BACK IN THE DAY...Aguilera again shows us her excuisit vocals, but she forced the album too much, somehow it's not NATURAL.But, still a good enough album to keep Christina up between the top pop artists of the new age. -by Dino!"
4,Great Music,"My spouse and I are sharing this CD..............he's 64 and I'm 57, we both love it! What an amazing talent."
4,Beyond Basics,Christina has what is arguably the best voice in pop culture. She really shines on the first disk with throwback vintage and samples of hip hop and rap tracks. Things start to go downhill after the first disk. The second cd was in my option thrown together which she should have stuck to the basics. With that said because of the first disc I highly recommend what is Christina best effort to date.
5,Very Surprised,I was very surprised I would liek this album since its completly out my favorite genres! Its really good although I didnt like the seconde c.d.! Its worth buying cuz it gives this whole new feeling when lsitening to it!Hot Tracks:1) Make Me Wanna Pray2) Back In The Day (This is pure fiyah)3) Ain't No Other Man4) Understand (Omg amazing)5) Slow Down Baby (Makes ya wanan get jiggy)6) F.U.S.S. (Interlude) (THIS IS A DISS TRACK BABY!)7) Still Dirrty8) Here To stay9) Thankyou (Dedication To the Fans...)10) Candyman11) I Got Trouble12) Hurt
4,It's alright,CD didn't turn out the way I thought it would be.This CD was told that she was influenced by the 20's great musicians such as B.B. king and Etta James and so forth.SOme songs are pretty cool as they are but it still has Christina's pop sense to the CD. I wanted to be more jazzy and cool.Her voice is amazing. It's just could've been better if she put more emphasis on her music from 20's.
4,Back To Basics is GOLD!!!!!,"Christina's voice is amazing. This album is very well put together, ""Back To Basics"" has 40's, jazz, and r&b music. I love her and this CD."
4,Great Album,Love the new/different sounds of Christina's latest albumFavorite tracks:Disc 1:3. Back in the Day7. Oh MotherDisc 2:1-36. Hurt9. The Right Man
5,An encyclopedia of different moods and styles,"It surprised me that this only gets 4/5... that is pretty low for an online ranking.This is an ambitious double album largely written and produced by Christina. In scope and size, it reminds me of the Beatles' ""White Album"" or even the Beastie Boys' ""Ill Communication."" But it's probably easier to listen to than either.A few parts of the album are silly, but more parts are amazing. The 23 tracks break down into 4 or 5 up-tempo numbers for the radio, some ballads, a few tracks with a big-band type feel, and many that don't fit into a category. That all sounds very disjointed but the end result is not.All of this is infused with tremendous energy and effort by Christina and her big supporting cast. The end result is a pleasant surprise. This validates anyone who (like me) saw glimmers of this in her earlier music."
5,Worth the money,"This was my very first Christina purchase, and it was well worth the money for this double-CD set. This woman has a voice that rocks the house, and now I understand her fashion style. Her music is mature and varied. She is a real joy to listen to. It's hard to sit still around her. She really is a Diva."
2,this girl can sing,I always knew this girl could sing. and she is singing great on this CD and most every song is worth a listen. but did she have to make a double disc that sucks it makes it to hard to decide which one to play first.
2,So disappointed.,"I was eagerly awaiting the drop of this cd, only to find that this is not the Christina I know, love, and can sing along with. I lovelovelove every one of her albums, but this one is simply a total letdown. As previous reviewers have stated, she's got the voice, the look, etc., but she's got no hits on this album, I'm afraid.Christina, get back to the Top 40 music that we love to listen to, sing to, that inspires us to get up and dance, even if we're mid-thirties-mamas!"
5,Good...if you like POOP!,"I'm sorry, I don't even know what the hell I'm talking about.Buy this album if you like sex. Christina Aguilera IS sex!Now I'm going to go lock myself in my basement and sentence myself to isolation and self-torture. I apologize."
1,WHAT?,This CD doesn't even deserve a rating. Im sorry but this child has no clue and should just take up another hobby.
1,Just cuz you can SCREAM REAL LOUD doesn't mean you should!,"Don't believe all the hype...this album is terrible. You will like this album if:1.You enjoy the sound of a screaming woman singing endless scales...over...and over... and over again.2.You love songs that go on and on about how great the singer is and just how wonderful she has managed to touch everyone's life (the last track). It's really pathetic.3. Sophmoric oversimplifications on what it means ""to be a woman"".That said, there are two good songs on the first disc. These are:Back in the dayStill NastyBut I have to tell you, you get pretty tired of playing these two songs over and over again....best thing is just to download them. The second disc is pure superfluous junk, with a few good songs to make it interesting.Both discs would have made a decent single disc. Don't waste your money without listening to the whole thing first."
1,A Waste Of Time And Money,"There is no substance to this wreck. Absolute pap. She should go back to bouncing that sweet body around, chirping stupid, pre-pubescent lyrics and leave serious music to grown-ups. I hope that I can dump this dog as ""played once"" and hope it will never again be in my earshot."
4,Risk-taker with talent,"Although there are few oddball songs (that I still like), there is much inspired work that is fun to listen to."
5,She still got it....,"wow....she still got it....This woman's voice STILL gives me the chills...all it took was one listen to ""Right Man""unbelieveable...she still got it after so long. I honestly thought she could never outdo 'Stripped': boy was i WRONG.Listen for yourself. I won't blab much or select which songs you should listen to...go cop it. i need not say more."
2,Um..........no I don't think so,This cd is a dissapointment. I regret not listening to it before I bought it. I'm not into jazz and blues music so I couldn't appreciate the vast majority of the songs on either cd. It seems like a blast from the past that I am not interested in. I think there are about 3 songs I could maybe get into and they are not that great because I can't even remember the titles. I was hoping that the second disc in the set would be a little different than the first and while it is to a certain extent I still wasn't impressed. I absolutley loved Stripped (2003) so I assumed this one would be great as well. My advice to Christina fans: LISTEN TO THE CD BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT.
3,glossy dance pop and very slick studio production,"The tracks destined to be singles have really (I mean really) generic lyrics. These singles are danceable and catchy but to anyone older than 16, they are complete fluff. Teenage girls will love this CD until they move onto something else 2 months from now.The studio production is too slick for its own good. With Aguilera's amazing voice there's no need for all of the digital processing.Will anyone be listening to this a few years from now? No. The problem is that Christina is a powerful voice lacking a definable personnality in her own music. She's just aping the song styles of current and previous decades."
2,A total letdown,This CD had only 3 good songs out of about 20. It truly was a letdown and I wish I didn't buy it. She was just way out there on this one; not even close to her usual style.
3,A Few Listens Required,"So I'm going to say basically the same thing as the other reviewers. This album is one that takes a while to actually get into. With Christina claiming that this was more of a old school record with a sort of twist I went into buying this record picturing more of the Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong sounds that I love and that she said she had. Unfortunately it didn't have the old school sound I expected let alone more upbeat fun songs like ""Ain't No Other Man"" featured amongst the songs on the record.Most of the songs are ballads which is fine but once again its harder I think to get into a record like that but the best song on the album has to be ""Ain't No Other Man"" that song alone was my main reason for buying this album and now I have to continue listening to the album to figure out what other song I actually like. But I don't find this album a waste of money because it is pretty decent just not what I expected."
4,The haters can say what they want....,Say what you want. This woman can blow. Mentioning her name in the same breath as Britney Spears is like comparing Marvin Gaye with William Hung. If you didn't know who was singing you wouldn't know what to do with this album. So stop hatin' and give the woman her props.
1,I didn't know music could be this bad,"Every time one of the songs from this album comes on the radio, I have to turn it off. This was one of the most pitiful attempts at music I've ever heard."
3,No Stripped.,"I bought this CD on it's release date, and didn't rate it immediately. I wanted to give it a few listens before doing so, because I wasn't all impressed on my first listen.My opinion hasn't changed much. I feel this CD lacks substance.The only real catchy tracks are ""Ain't No Other Man"" and ""Still Dirrty"" in my opinion.I do love the packaging, and photography in the CD book, which is my main reason for rating this higher than 2 stars.I love Christina's voice, but was just hoping for another ""Stripped"" moment..."
4,Christina At Her Best,"""Back To Basics"" is an incredible 2 disc album. The first disc gives off vibes of early motown, soul, and funk legends such as, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Ray Charles, etc. It's amazing. The second disc has more of a seductive Marilyn Monroe feel to it. I know Marilyn Monroe wasn't a singer, but the songs gave off that type of vibe to me. The second disc wasn't as good as the first one, but still a great effort from Christina. You definitely get your money's worth with this album. I applaud Christina...""Back To Basics"" is amazing."
4,GOOD ALBUM !!!,"I thought i wasnt gonna like this Christina Aguielra album but its actually good . Im not really into all that old type of music but i like this album. I just really hate that song CANDYMAN i tried to like it but i dont ! but the rest of the songs are good my favorite one is number 9 (on the 2nd disc) ""The Right Man"". But one thing is true Christina Aguilera could sing !!! Her voice is amazing !!!"
5,She does it again!,This girl does not disappoint! An absolutely stunning CD from the most talented voice of our generation!Highlight for me is Save Me From Myself
2,"We Get it Christina, You Love Your Husband","How many songs can one person write about their husband? In Christina's case, almost a whole disc's worth. Almost every song on the first disc is about her husband. Couldn't you write about something else? There are two songs about how she is still dirty. Please, who cares. And she doesn't even say she's dirty in a nice way. If you don't agree with her, then she insults you. The second disc is remakes of old songs, and songs that belong in another decade. I don't mind hearing songs like that, but could you mix it up a bit. What happened to the Christina that made fun songs, and songs that told an important message? I wish I didn't pay the $18."
1,The advancement of the commonaire,"I bought, I listened, I threw away! Tough times in the music biz. Hip-Hop has hit another stalemate. Even in the attempt to advance they have managed to circle around and bump each other on the head. Let's take Christina out of the equation for a second, the fun boy producers did a pretty good job at creating another common album. Good attempt at getting your money from the project. Money Money Money. Putting Christna back in the equation. Her cat screach of a voice has gone on for two albums too long. she should probably give it up at this point. You've made your money. It's time to retire into the depths of the mainstream tabloids as another failed marriage and an eating disorder. I'm not impressed. there isn't too much I can say. The rest of the unsold CD's should be ground up and used as insulation on newly constructed homes in Louisiana. That would a better use of the plastic. Way to be common!"
3,Truly a Basic Production...Revised,"While artists should be recognized when trying to create different sounds and acknowledge certain eras...it should also be considered that the reason why that era isn't very popular now is because there's truly not a need to hear it or relive it. I truly admire Christina's courage but this Album really is just basic. I was expecting so much more. The only songs I really enjoy are ""On Our Way"" and "" Without You""...It shouldn't have been 2 discs. :(Update: After watching her perform this songs live...I really do enjoy the first disc alot...the 2nd disc not so much still because i'm not really into 30.40.50's music :)"
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'm a really big Christina fan. Hands down, she is one of the most talented singers and has one of the best voices out there. This album is mostly filled with mediocre music with nothing artiscically original and drab lyrics. It would be nice if she quit the persona facades and came out as a pure artist and just acted herself instead of a role. Although there are a couple of good tracks, the rest are filler. I was really disappointed with the outcome of this album."
1,Slutina Uglyaira,She tries too hard to copy every other diva and she has no originality what so ever. Her voice has got to be the most annoying sound ever. She can't carey a note longer than a second or two. Her fake soul sound is cheap and pathetic like her. Hate this so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The cat's pajamas.,"Christina's new album is like a trip back to the roaring twenties. Bands were big flappers had their hair bobbed and skirts short and one might find themselves at a speakeasie listening to similar music. Some of the songs are recorded in such a way that it sounds like you're listening to a 45 or an old radio. Combine the sound of big band with Christina's preternatural voice and the result is amazing. Not all the songs on the album are a flashback to the 20s, and are instead a bit more modern sounding.I should also mention that you get 21 tracks instead of the usual 10 or 11 that most albums consist of."
3,Good CD,I like Christina I think her voice is great. However the cd as a whole is not worth 4 or 5 stars-it should have been only one disc. I made an effort to listen to all songs and I only find myself liking:1. Aint No Other Man2. Understand3. Without You4. Welcome6. Nasty Naugty BoyWas it worth the $12 price? I guess it depends on how much you like the songs.
4,Impressive,"It's shameful but must admit for a long time Miss Aguilera wasn't even on my radar screen but over the years her unmistakable voice has become to prevalent to ignore. Once I got hip I have to say that I have been impressed ever since. This is a classic example of a young woman taking charge of her image, career, and destiny. Interestingly enough, there is no appearance from Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am, who seems to pop up everywhere these days, but thats not a bad thing. See, in is absence, Christina has sought the powers of Gangstarr's DJ Premier (found on the intro 'Back to Basics', 'Back in the Day', 'Ain't No Other Man', 'Still Dirrty', and the fan appreciative dedication 'Thank You'), who is in top form here. This time out she has fused Hip-Hop with Pop with a liberal sprinkling of soul. This is a bona-fide hit and a nice addition to the collections of fans and newcomers alike."
4,LOVE IT,"There are two CD's in this the first CD has all great songs. She has some love songs that were written and sung beautifully! Her second CD I like a couple of songs, its a circus theme back in the day kind of vibe to it, its still good though because girl can sing! So I recommend it!!!"
2,"She should market her voice, not her sexuality","What a shame. A wonderfully talented young woman with the most outstanding female voice in pop music today, and she still hasn't figured it out. I don't want to listen to an album filled with lyrics - some explicit - about sex. Whatever happened to songs that had meaning and could move you like ""Hurt""? This is perhaps the best song on the album because it showcases Christina's awesome voice, and the lyrics are powerful enough to move anyone to tears.I'm begging today's pop artists to cut the sex talk and get back to real music and lyrics!"
3,Overproduced,"As soon as I found out Christina was putting out a ""vintage jazz/soul"" disc I was extremely excited because I knew she could pull it off. However, the final product is so over the top I can't even stand it. For someone who is a huge fan of old jazz records I found this disc to be nothing but overproduced pop with only a slight influence of classic jazz/soul. She basically took multiple elements from different eras (too many eras in my opinion) and created a new sound. I do give her credit for the effort, though. The only song I really liked was ""Trouble"" because it sounds the most like an old jazz record. Everything else is too slick and just plain overdone. I wish Christina would have taken a bigger risk and made a real jazz/soul disc. That being said, her voice is so powerful I had to give this disc 3 stars. If anything, buy this disc for that alone and you will not be disappointed."
3,Advanced,"Christina Aquilera has really developed as an artist over the years, her songwriting and voice. She has surpased Mariah Carey in her development. I love her vocals and most of the songs. I only wish that she would put out a CD that didn't have the nasty songs on it. Being a Christian I had to toss the CD because of the lyrics of 3 of the songs on it. Technically speaking it is much more advanced than her previous work."
5,GREAT!!,"This is a 2-disk set - the first one is ""ok"", but I have nearly worn the second out. Sexy, sassy, and soulful!Love Nasty Naughty Boys, and Hurt reminds me of my relationship with my father, who is now deceased. Every song on the second CD is wonderful! I think Christina has really grown - Bravo!"
2,back to P.O.P...please?,"i grant christina the courage to reinvent herself in the music arena each time.But i think this time she overdid it.She should have stuck to the pop formula or the rock one of her last album.This one move proved too ambitious for the chart.The Linda Perry supervision can't savage the album concept from being tooooo much for the casual listener, and also i do believe for some hard core fans.Again, hats off for the road she chooses to take on..as Pink she really knows what she wants and she's not afriad to take the charge, but the project is too odd for my likings.Let's see what happens next time."
5,U GUYS R JUST JEALOUS,"Everyone who says that this album isn't what it was ""promised"" to be or that she sings too many notes or that she needs to hold them.. or that she over sings (BULL) is just jealous. AS IF you could do even 5% as much as she's done with this album.. or sing like her. In my personal opinion, she is the best singer of her generation. Plus, who do u ppl think u r critizing her?! She IS a real human being who cares about what other people say about her.. and she did work extremely hard on this album. Its great.. get over it... get lives. <3"
1,Low amperage,"The packaging claims this is a 6-amp switch, but it smoked and melted after about 20 minutes on a 55-watt headlamp load (at 14 volts that's 4 amps). Problem is that the wires are tiny, so there's too much resistance at the terminals, at both ends. I got smoke from inside the switch and from the crimped terminal at the end of the low-beam wire. If you run a big headlamp on this switch you'll also need to wire in a couple of relays to handle the current."
5,"Great controller, like the 'Off' headlight feature","I picked this switch up for my '06 YZ450F supermoto conversion project. Easy to install, simple wiring chart on back, no issues. Highly recommend. Blue led lights up when in 'Hi-beam' mode."
4,Vietnam,I enjoyed this book very much. I wanted an historical novel about Vietnam and this gave me some background before the Vietnam war.
4,Favorable,"Graham Greene's masterpiece, the Quiet American provides and interesting perspective upon Vietnam during the decline of the French presence in Indochina. The characters are well presented and the plot in which they exist is dynamic and easily holds one's attention throughout the book's short length. The Quiet American is an exiting, tumultuous, and provocative look into the turmoil and chaos that was Vietam"
3,A quiet review,"Having been written before the involvement of the US in Vietnam, the book is worth a read. The characters are well built, through fall in line with the popular notions of Americans. This is handled well. Throughout there is a real sense of innocence in the main character, which ironically, leads to the opposite effect. I am giving this book three stars because there are moments that lag. The conversation seems to head in a direction void of the reader's presence. In any case, its still a good read."
4,End of Empire,"Some people hate this book, but what they really detest is the antihero protaganist, Fowler, a jaded and decaying British journalist observing a naive American, Pyle, slowly immersing himself in Vietnam. Written in the fifties, it can be seen as a prophetic symbol of the futility of our Southeast Asia policies, as well as an indictment of latent American messianic romanticism. The two characters are apt symbols of his nation, although peripheral characters should also be thought of as relevant when considering the novel's characterization of national characters. The toothless collapse of the European imperialistic mission, and the beginning of the end of ours."
5,The most telling of Greene's best works..,"""..I wished there was someone to whom I could say that I was sorry."" -- writes Fowler, our 'hero'. Like many of Greene's characters, he is tormented by sin and the need to repent. Unlike many of Greene's characters, though, Fowler can't believe there is a God (see the opening quote) and is all the more interesting because of it. Based on Greene's own experiences as a 50s-Vietnam War correspondent, this one is my personal favorite of his many great books."
4,The Quiet American.,"""The Quiet American"" is a skillfully written book, by one of the most underrated authors of our century. The characters are carefully created symbols of two ideologies--the weary veteran Brit and the idealistic gung-ho American. Wonderfully written, memorable characters, and a slew of powerful quotes...this novel comes hightly recommended. A++"
4,"Written 60 years ago but so ahead of its time, it remains fresh and compelling","Graham Greene pulled off another masterpiece of dark, moody and melancholy reflection on the nature of power and individual accountability in this account of strife torn Indochina post WW II. Saigon is a city on edge as the Viet Cong forces from the communist held north move ever closer to overwhelming the French colonial authority. Ordinary people become the playthings of others' agendas be they political, emotional or criminal. Everyone is out to secure their own future before the final collapse comes. In the middle of this a cynical British journalist and a naive (or is he actually brutally manipulative?) US agent are thrown together collaborating / contesting for their own selfish / philanthropic ends. Greene conveys the menace and the despair so powerfully he could be writing about today's dirty geopolitical struggles. A memorable story that gives you frequent pause to think."
1,Quiet American,This product arrived in great condition unfortunately the narrator lacks expression when reading. I was disappointed in this and turned it off. How do you describe the character Phuong as a clink of a tea cup or as a phoenix without changing the tone and expressiveness of your voice.I doubt if I will listen to any more of it.
2,Two and-a-half stars is probably more accurate,"This is my first ever book by Greene. I did not care for his writing style -- very dry, and he did not make the characters come alive for me.It is hard to read literature without having current events impact on what you're reading. For me, this has been especially true post-9/11. This book was filled with anti-American sentiment, which really bothered me.I only read this book because I wanted to see the movie with Brendan Fraser. Of the actors working today, Fraser is my second-favorite actor after Tom Hanks (way, way second, because Mr. Hanks is of course far superior), but second-favorite nonetheless. The movie was actually in some ways better than the book, except Caine was too old for the role, and Fraser was also miscast, IMO.But back to Greene. Despite my very lukewarm response to this book, I will still read one other novel by him. I never give up on anybody who is considered a major novelist without at least reading two books by him or her."
3,"A readable, but shallow classic","Maybe the innocent (quiet, American) Pyle is as dangerous to the country of Vietnam as a leper without a bell but Graham Greene must have smoked too much opium doing research for this novella. This must be one of the silliest, most self-important books about war that I've ever read."
5,Our Man in Havana,"Our Man in Havana is a classic. Extremely well written. The best fiction book I have read, full of twists and turns and hard to put down."
3,"Good metaphor, but my least favorite of Greene's","Obvious metaphors, good ones though. This is my least favorite of Greene's books. maybe because the characters are not as engaging...."
2,Brilliant novel. Read it.,"First, let me say that this novel is brilliant, insightful and lyric. It manages to be thought-provoking and entertaining at the same time and is just a true joy to read on so many levels. That said, the reading of ""The Quiet American"" in this audio book format leaves something to be desired.Joseph Porter has a lovely voice well-suited to the narrator, and even well-suited to the main female character Phuong. However, as soon as the titular quiet american breaks his silence, the feigned American accent Porter reads with is simply appalling. I found it beyond distracting. I find that if you can't do an accent well for a public reading, best to leave it alone and read in your own voice. Joseph Porter could be forgiven for reading the lines of the American characters with a British lilt. There was no reason to forge ahead just to decimate the reading so awfully."
2,Okay,"Used this book for school, I personally didn't like it, but It was helpful for that class. Not my cup of tea."
4,Good listen. . .,"The story is excellent and very timely. The reading is very good EXCEPT when the narrator does the voice of the Quiet American, who is a Bostonian. The reader uses an annoying pseudo-Texas accent that is totally wrong and completely detracts from the story."
3,war story with love trouble,"The story plays in the Vietnam war in 1954. A british journalist, Fowler, lives with his mistress Phuong in Saigon. Everything goes the right way until Pyle enters the story. Everybody calls him the quiet American. Fowler and Pyle become friends, but then there is a problem. Pyle falls in love with Phuong and wants to marry her...The story contains interesting characters. It is the story about a friendship of two completely different men who love the same woman.First I didn't like to read the story, because it's a difficult language with all the special ""war expressions"". At the end many things become clear. The love story I don't find very special, but interesting. I recommend the book to people who like love stories with historical background."
5,Classic Graham Greene,"Forget the bogus religiosity and sentimental notions of redemption. Forget also Greene's dubious morality and instead thrill at the story and the quality of his writing. The 'Quiet American' still hits all the right buttons - great characters (not even Michael Caine, in a recent screen adaptation, can ruin that!), thrilling plot and close historical and geographical detail making his evocation of French Vietnam on the eve of the (disastrous) American involvement fascinating reading. Greene at his best. Top read. Buy it!"
2,A Disappointment.,"I am a fan of Graham Greene; he is one of the few writers I have ever read who deals with issues of hope and dispair in real and honest terms. After reading works such as The Heart of the Matter and The Human Factor, I expected more of Greene than a shallow and naive allegory about America's involvement in Viet Nam. Greene is far more adept at revealing the frailties of the human heart than he is at reducing the complexities of world politics into individual characters. In The Quiet American, Greene tries to do both but succeeds at neither. Skip it."
3,I bought it for a World Literature Class,"Hi Everyone,I just bought this book for a World Lit class, so as far as its purpose goes, it was a fine book...but a little confusing at first when trying to get used to how the author jumps around in time when telling the story. I liked it, nonetheless.Ruth Tanner"
2,Poor book,"AT first you think that you are going to read about some secret agent in Vietnam that was killed, but when you see that the story of the book is not that man, is a journalist from England that doesn't want to go back to his country you will be disappointed, the book doesn't have any main story, it has the story of the journalist, his girlfriend (who was also the girlfriend of the ""secret agent"") and many more, but you will not be interested in one story at all, a real waste of time this book."
2,"You know classics, and this isn't one of them.","Stop. The emporer has no clothes. There is something of a story and plot here to keep you, but the dialogue is horrendous. There are kids in high school lit classes that can write better dialogue that this. You will find hard to recollect when the last time you heard adults conversing like this, no matter what the intentions of the author. Yes, there are simpletons in this world, but characters like Pyle are too extreme to permit any believability. Next time I wont go from Hemingway to Greene."
5,A premonition about Vietnam,"To read The quiet American now, some thity years after the end of a sensless and disastrous war, gives us an unexpected vision of Vietnam, its people and the United States involvement in that war. Furthermore, it's inevitable to think of the present war in Iraq.It's no news that Graham Green is a magnificent fiction writer, witty, sometimes funny, always capable of digging deep into historical situations and different people habits and values (The power and the glory and The comedians are very good examples)but in the qiet American he is also a cruel reporter and a skillful creator of full size human characters.The Viking Critica Library edition has also an enormoues value for the inclusion of literary reviews from the first edition of the book and the opinons of experts both in literature and Vietnam history.Javier Olmedo,Mexico City, Mexico"
3,Buy a different version,"In short, the story is great but the introduction/political commentary by Robert Stone was senseless trash. At times I wondered if he had even read the book. Buy another version and avoid his rambling. Be sure to read up on the author. He had an interesting life, once working for British Intelligence and famously declaring that he would rather live in the Soviet Union than the United States."
4,Good,"The product was shipped fast and orderly and came on time. I wasn't able to add the class, but that's a different story."
5,Write Arabic including sounds,"After going through with your web page and I like to know more on writing Qur'an alphabets.For eg.ALIF, BA TA THA ETC.ETC until ALHAMTHULLAH.Then I can follow the Al-Qur'an in CD-ROM.I'm happy if you got CD-ROM is much appriciated."
2,Pocket size is too small and the print too poor to be useful,"I bought this because it was cheap, but I don't think it is worth the price in this small size. It is only 4.25"" x 5.25"". The print is tiny and not very clearly printed, so even with a magnifying glass I was often guessing at the spelling of unfamiliar words (in Arabic). On the other hand, I think the dictionary itself is good and would be very useful in a larger and more clearly printed version. I looked up some test words in both English and Arabic and found it to be useful."
4,Great for Beginning Learners,This product is great for beginning learners. As a teacher of Arabic I truly recomend this book. It is a little expensive but it is worth it (I still use it).
5,"Yes, this is the one you are looking for....","English speakers learning Arabic find an uneven mixture of reference books out there, from learned treatises aimed at native speakers to ""learn how to say 'this costs too much' for your trip to Egypt"" travel guides.Al-Mawrid al-WaseeT is a standard, comprehensive dictionary produced by the Arabic equivalent of the German Duden. This is all the dictionary you need, the one you keep on your shelf for those moments, desperate or otherwise, when you need to find a word. The print is clear in both English and Arabic. One drawback: because this book was intended for Arabs, the English-Arabic section skimps on the Harakat, meaning that the short vowels are not always written out.Once you have this book you will be ready to start reading and writing real Arabic texts..."
2,Convenient but missing many words,"It's good to have in one book as an Arabic-English and English-Arabic dictionary. However I found that it doesn't include many of the words that are commonly used in the daily newspaper articles, which makes it unreliable for me. Many times I had to use my computer to search for the meaning of the word, so what's the point of buying it?!"
3,wish,"I use al Mawrid to me it is the best Arabic English dictionary.I am looking for it in e books for my kindle,I cant find it.I wish there will be a kindle edition of this great dictionary."
3,Trail map,This is a pretty good map of the trails in the Colrado Springs area. I wish the trails had been a little better defined on the map - maybe a little larger scale with smaller section of the area.
2,Not a hiking map,"If you're looking for a map with trails and hiking info, don't waste your money on this one. It has but a very broad, widespread layout, with very limited information about Pike's Peak. Very disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"This is a 1:75,000 scale map of the Colorado Springs area west of I25, showing only a small part east of I25. I bought it thinking it would show me trails where I could walk. The scale is too small to do this in a helpful way. The reverse of the map has a partial list of trails; because it's a sheet publication it cannot describe all the trails in such a large area. There is an enlarged map of the Garden of the Gods park, but you can get a more useful one free at the Visitors' Center. I ended up getting another publication. This is a pretty map to hang on a wall, but the scale is too small to be useful for a hiker looking for a trail to suit his/her abilities and interests."
3,Not my thing.,"I am in no way dissing this band. Their sound is very original and what they are doing is very cool. I only found 2 songs to be enjoyable to my ears, otherwise, I didn't like that album that much.I hope they keep coming up with this stuff though. It's very cool, just not my cup of tea."
4,Almost perfect and a great investment,"McGard made a high quality and well fitting lug nuts with this set. I would recommend going to their website and checking the fit there to make sure you have the right thread size and pitch for your vehicle [...]. Only issue (and reason for 4 stars) are the lug nuts stick out slightly from flush with the wheel due to the length. They are substantially longer than the stock lugs. However, it's not too noticeable and worth the protection and he key fits perfectly into the lug. Well made product."
3,No washer seat.,"Why, McGard, don't you put washer seats on these like you do your spline-drive lug nuts? Why would I go through the trouble of getting nice lugs for my wheels only to have your locks tear up the seat area?Lame. Fix it."
3,doesn't fit 2012 Ford Escape,"Definitely a quality product when you choose the correct size. I'm always a fan of ""Made in the USA"" products.I chose this set for my 2012 Ford Escape because Amazon said they were the correct choice. However, the stud length on the Escape is slightly longer than the lock will allow. If you have an Escape, you will need to use the longer 24137 locks which Amazon says will not fit."
5,great locks,"I have been useing wheel locks since the 1970, on a 1968 Barracuda. I have tried several diffrent brands even the factory OEM ones. I reguard this type lock the best for the money. I like this design best."
5,Just plain great,"This is about my favorite drill bit I own. I've drilled a bunch of holes in hard maple with this bit, and it hasn't even made a single burn mark in anything. Still going strong."
5,Great bit,"I bought this bit because my hole saw was too shallow to go through the desk I wanted to drill a two inch hole in. I decided to splurge fro the 3 times more expensive carbide tip bit instead of the steel bit. I'm glad I did!This may be my new favorite tool, and definitely my favorite drill bit. It cut through the wood so much faster than my hole saw.One Pearl: I highly recommend a hammer drill. I used my drill with hammering turned off and it cut well. When I turned on the hammering it was a whole different experience. I'd estimate that it cut 8-10 times faster with the hammering.In summary, this is one incredible drill bit.I can't comment on how long it will stay sharp but carbide bits can easily be sharpened by a professional. Also, if it's any indicator, this bit produced a surprisingly low amount of heat when in use. My hole saw used to get so hot it smoked, not this one."
3,What's in a Name?,"Although this cook book does contain some wonderful recipes, I was very surprised to find so many of the recipes called for dairy, eggs, and/or refined sugars (brown sugar is refined). I thing the author/publisher missed the mark when they included ""Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar"" in the titled of this book.Many of the cake recipes call for eggs. My wife has made several cakes using egg replacer or tofu which were better than ""the real thing"". In the Appendices, Dr Fenster does provide substitution tables, which are quite extensive. However, my expectation, based on the title, was that the recipes would be without wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, yeast, or refined sugar. I am disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this book hoping to make some recipes for my husband, who has many allergies. The title is misleading. Most of the recipes use brown sugar, which IS refined sugar and not healthy. Many recipes use dairy and eggs. This book is also not good for someone with allergies to corn or potato either as many contain these ingredients. I was disappointed and am sending it back."
2,Don't waste your time,"The cover page of this book says, ""Healthy cooking without wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, yeast or refined sugar,"" but it doesn't really deliver on that promise. If you have intolernaces to multiple ingredients, your options in this book are going to be extremely limited. And it should be titled ""baking, breads and desserts"", not ""cooking"". My expectation was to find some recipes for entrees I could prepare, as well as desserts. There weren't any.Overall, this book is not worth it. I'll sell you mine used (new condition)..."
5,Freud Forstner Bit,Very high quality bit. I put it to heavy use immediately and it's standing up extremely well.
1,Get Started With your PC,"While it does teach you, the downside is it automaticly downloads aton of other programs into your PC. For a beginner you then have to fiquire out how to get rid of them. You then have to down load the entire program to get rid of them. Not cool at all."
1,Worst movies ever,Ok I knew these would be bad movies but they are virtually unwatchable. I like old B movies and was hoping for one gem in this collection but no such luck. Go with one of the Corman collections instead.
3,A good outline book of the circumnavigation by Drake,"Wilson's book gives the reader a taste of the tremendous adventure this must have been for Drake and those in his group. Very soon, into the South Atlantic, they were in strange, new waters where mystery and superstition dominated the thoughts of the explorers. There is so much more the reader longs to know - what were the thoughts of the average crew members? What did the physical sights look like to them. What was day-to-day life like on this long voyage? Of course, Wilson had little to go on. The principal diary of Drake was lost after he turned it over to the Queen. The book is readable and exciting. With few earthly frontiers left, we can only imagine the spirit of adventure these men must have felt. But so much is lost down through the ages. Even the Ship - the Golden Hind - was itself not preserved and decayed into rotten wood. We must be thankful for what little is left to know about this great voyage."
4,Profound,"Luce's ability to detail and portray his characters continues to impress me years after my first experiences with his work. Lillian is a prime example of Luce's profound insight into the minds of those about whom he writes and I sincerely recommend anyone interested in contemporary American literture to experience Luce's Lillian, as well as his copious other works."
1,"If you must read this book, get it from the library.","I too wish I had read reviews of this book before wasting my money. I was about to board a train for a 3 hour ride and wanted something to read. Even so, I put it down after a couple of chapters. I eventually finished it in a moment of madness. It reminds me of someone's (not very good) 8th grade English project - zero imagination, zero feeling for Jane Austen's style. A complete waste of time."
2,Darcy isn't deep enough for me...,"I had high expectations of this book, and I'll admit I was left disapointed. Most of this book is dialogue directly from Pride & Prejudice. I understand that some people wouldn't want to tamper with the classic, but I think some creative license could have been taken. When Darcy was speaking it was all mostly word for word from Austen, or a paraphrasing of what he said in Austen's work. I thought there would be some extra scenes, and though there were a few thrown in, they were rather dull. I did gain some insight into Darcy as a person, but I felt it was more of a telling, not a showing. I love the story, so it was nice to almost read it again, but I felt after reading it that Darcy wasn't much more illuminated than in the original."
4,highly enjoyable,I though this book was really good. I liked the fact that the P&P was told from Darcy's point of view. The original dialogue provided familiarity while adding a bit of difference due to Darcy's thoughts being added. My only complaint: too short! :D
3,Good not great,"I enjoyed this book. It is not as good as Mr Darcy's Diary or the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman Series -- but it is a satisfying read that further invites you to imagine what Darcy was thinking and doing when his life changed after meeting Elizabeth. It's a very fast read. I am glad to have it part of my collection."
4,Consistent with the Master,"I never read book reviews prior to reading a book. In this case I am glad for I would have missed reading this one. I liked this book very much. I have read comments that it lifted from P&P and lacked imagination. That may be so, but what this book does is fill in the gaps and allows the reader to take the relationship further. Maybe I liked it so very well because I dislike books that do not keep characters consistent. I found this book very pleasing, and like visiting an old friend again with fresh conversation."
3,Decent but not good enough to tempt me =)2.5 stars,"I had been waiting for ""The Confession of Fitzwilliam Darcy"" by Mary Street for so long to get a novel with Darcy's point of view that I settled for this one.There's too much lifting of Jane Austen's text (which a reader would know already) from Pride and Prejudice and not enough suppositions on the what, why and feelings of Mr. Darcy..."
5,Wonderful Interpretation of Darcy's Story!,"First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. After reading Pride and Prejudice, I kept wondering more and more about Darcy, what HE was thinking, what HE was doing? Elizabeth was carefully and wonderfully portrayed by Jane Austen. I would have loved for Jane Austen to have gone into Darcy's life more, but she didn't. When I purchased Darcy's Story by Janet Aylmer, I never expected to read it like a Jane Austen novel. I just wanted a story behind Darcy, the way I would think really happened at that time in history. The fact that Janet Aylmer kept the storyline in sync with Pride and Prejudice was wonderful for me. I knew where we were with each chapter. I knew where Elizabeth was, and now I know where Darcy was.Overall, I have to say I really enjoyed reading Darcy's side of Pride and Prejudice through Janet Aylmer's interpretation. I think Jane would have approved!"
2,HUH?,Is this a original story or did the author just take lines from Miss Austen and add a few extra words? Save your money! There are much better Darcy novels out there!
2,"Lame, but 2 stars for being based on P&P","I bought this book on a whim because I love P&P. However, I think more of the book was verbatim Jane Austin than it was original. There was minimal new characterization of Darcy (although I did get more of a view of his sister). Skip this one--or at least, borrow it."
3,ehh... it was okay.,"Darcy's Story by Janet Atlmer is a retelling of the classic Pride and Prejudice story of Jane Austen. None of the actual plot has changed, only that it is now told from the perspective of Mr. Darcy.The story is kept authentic and many of the conversations are exactly as they are in P&P.; A new understanding and compassion for Mr. Darcy is present as you see his internal struggle and the truth behind his actions and motives.This is an alright P&P; retelling. Some new information is addressed, but the majority of the novel is just a dry revisit of the actual story. Those who love P&P;, but are offended by adaptations, what if? variations, and lustful recreations, will find this rendering refreshing and respectful to Austen and her characters. Purists will enjoy this greatly. Those looking for increasing romance and new exciting twists, should look elsewhere."
3,I agree with the official review,"Nice idea, to retell from Darcy's point of view, but this book really didn't add much to what the original text describes. Bland. Nice but no more."
1,waiting for it to get better,"i must admit, most of the time when i read reviews, i usually go against what the majority says, but here, i would have to agree! This book was extremly boring! i kept waiting for the story to be more insightful and tell me something i didnt know, but it mainly repeated everything and gave me nothing on Darcy's point a veiw that his simple grin didnt already tell me! I didnt like this book at all"
2,Just Reread PandP instead,"Mr Darcy only appears in about a third of Pride and Prejudice. I suppose that's why my copy of Darcy's Story is about a third as long as my copy of P and P. Instead of using the source material to show new sides to Darcy, the book is mostly word for word copying of P and P! I have read many rewritings/sequels/other points of view for this novel and even the terrible ones had some new idea to put out, and this had NOTHING. I give the book two stars because it isn't really ""bad"", it's just boring. If you haven't reread P and P in a while, it may be less painful, but I found myself skipping ahead through passages I had read a few days previously, while re reading Pride and Prejudice.Thank goodness I got it from the library and didn'tpay for this drivel, I wouldn't want to encourage this author, especially after reading the essay the author writes for the back of the book. She comes off very conceited and arrogant and I found myself actually getting angry at her."
1,Tedious Despite Chance to be Great,"Am a huge Austin fan, particularly of Pride & Prejudice, so indulged myself by purchasing this book to keep more company with Austin's beloved characters. Mr. Darcy is stoic in the original, but downright tedious in this. He just doesn't come alive on the pages and much of the dialogue is a rehash from the original. I did enjoy learning more about Darcy's sister, Georgiana, and her time with Wickham, but there wasn't much more to pique my interest. I slogged through and did finish it- so there was much rejoicing on my part. Unfortunately, the celebration was because this novel was over!"
1,"I Already Read Pride & Prejudice, Thank You",Can this woman be sued for plagarism? I felt like I was reading the same story except written by someone standing in the other corner of the room. There is no creativity in developing Darcy further that we already understand him. I could not even finish the book I was so bored.
1,Disappointing,Redundant and plodding writing. Lacks the energy to complement the original story. Redundant. Treats readers as if they cannot retain details and dialog for more than a handful of pages. Did I mention redundant?
2,Beware nit-picks!,"I really cannot comment as to the plot Darcy's Story since it reproduces P&P; so exactly (in fact, a majority of the language is lifted directly from Austen's novel.) I will say that Alymer seems to go to no pains to complicate the original plot or introduce any great twists, surprises, or revelations. The narrative is plodding and somewhat repetitive, and neither particularly pleasant nor unpleasant to read. Its greatest virtue may be its brevity--it is readable in a single sitting.My major objection to this book is the shoddy copyediting. Elizabeth is alternately referred to as Miss Elizabeth and Miss Bennet (in her elder sister's presence,) and other characters are sometimes referred to by the wrong name/title. There are punctuation errors every few pages, which sometimes results in confused dialogue. Italics are used inconsistently. If you are a reader who is bothered or distracted by these types of sloppy errors, be forewarned."
3,"Just a bit more Mr. D, please...","An Austen devotee, I was looking for a little bit more of the P&P story. ""Darcy's Story"" was a quick, fun read that fit the bill. Thankfully, JA doesn't bastardize the original, she just gives the reader a bit more to think about...much like the ""deleted scenes"" on a DVD of your favorite movie. There will NEVER be a true sequel to P&P, so you have to take this book for what it is - a celebration of our favorite Austen hero!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm generally very tolerant of adaptations of Jane Austen novels, but I was tempted more than once to throw this book across the room. It's wooden, repetitive, and semi-literate. As other reviewers have noted, the author leans heavily on passages lifted straight from P&P and repeated until you want to scream, so the original material, such as it is, is quite sparse."
5,a must read for all in industrialized countries,"This book, which I dearly wish was not back ordered, is an excellent look at our polluted environment and how that pollution is effecting our health. It also helps the reader find ways to overcome the toxic pollutants in our environment, to lessen their effect on our bodies."
4,Mostly good and sound,"Wellness Against all Odds came to me through reviews and readings of other books by this author. I agree with the reviews here; it offers much clarity and common sense about nutrition and medical conditions and for this reason I would recommend it heartily. However, Sherry lost me when she added the final chapter which included personal comments that were out of place in this otherwise wonderful book of reason. I did not need to hear her interpretation of religion and societal ills which she seems to think are due in part to the separation of church and state. Such views left a bad taste in my mouth by the time I finished the book, and were harder to ignore than the many typos in this book."
1,Very disorganized,"The subject is hard to follow because the book is so disorganized. A good editor was needed here. I returned the book for a refund. The seller is excellent, They accepted the return and a refund was issued promptly minus the return postage which I paid."
4,Wellness Against All Odds,"The book is very informative The author is qualified to make the statements in the book. The book is well organized. The book got a little beat up in the mail, but was still in good condition for a used book"
5,Informative book necessary in a world full of chemicals.,"Susiesunshine, this message is for you. I have read Sherry's book and I found it to be very informative and helpful. She has so much knowledge in a field where only few doctors have even explored. Honestly, I feel Dr. Rogers may be the only doctor in the world than can help me. I would highly recommend her book, and would appreciate anyone's help regarding contacting Dr. Rogers. Thank you. wildwolf777@hotmail.com"
2,Written in haste--and it shows,"Julia Quinn's next book was supposed to be ""The Two Dukes of Wyndham,"" but, as the author herself reported on her website, she found it impossible to write one duke's story without writing the other's simultaneously. But I guess she had a contractual obligation to deliver a book for June 2007, and this is the very, very disappointing result.The hero is thoroughly unlikeable, the heroine only slightly less so. The hackneyed ""I had my heart broken and will never love again"" conflict is tritely handled. And Quinn's usually sparkling repartee sometimes devolves into the heroine pounding her little fists against the hero's broad chest--please, Julia, you can do better than this!Save your money and re-read ""When He Was Wicked."""
2,It was ok....,"but I felt it could have been a little better. I, oddly enough, loved ""On the Way To the Wedding but couldn't get into this one. While some of the banter was laugh out loud funny others were repetitive. I didn't get where Turner started getting interested in Miranda. He kissed her (without an ounce of passion as he stated) then all of a sudden he knew what man would make her happy. I kept thinking I've read over that part where the attraction on his part began.Another thing that go tedious was Miranda's declaration (in her mind) that it was LOVE she felt for Turner...I felt like her feelings were shoved down our throats. We got it!The bright spot was Olivia...she was entertaining and is begging for her own story."
1,Disappointing,"I so very much wanted to like this book. The characters were okay, likeable but not very memorable, the story was a cute one, BUT there was barely any plot. Yes, we got the message that Miranda was an ugly duckling and felt like one, but repeating that for 300 pages was way more than I could bear.Julia Quinn is a very talented writer who can do better than this."
2,.,The idea here was that life had created what was a happy and loving young man dark and jaded...but he didn't seem that bad. At best he was sort of bland.
3,Not her best,"I love Julia Quinn books, but this one was not my favorite. Everything about it was mediocre. I didn't find myself liking the main characters as much as I have in her past books."
3,Charmingly Cheeky!,"I loved every minute of this book that I actually finished it in one night. It's full of banter filled with dry humor. The chemistry between Miranda and Turner just sparks. It's refreshing to see Julia Quinn write something other than the Bridgerton family, but I must admit I love the little references to them in this book.Of course the plot is the same as most other romance novels, but I felt such an affinity towards Miranda that I couldn't help but wish that I had a puppy love that actually developed into something more substantial.So I guess if you're just looking to escape reality for a couple of hours and want to read something not to challenging (and love reading cheesy romance novels) then this is something you might be interested in."
4,Pleasing Historical Love Story !,Miranda fell in love with Turner when she was child. They are both adults and he is now widow and she is still in love. It is a sweet simple story of love being the answer to a happy life. Miranda and Turner both have to grow up and a nice process. I finished this in a day and it left me all warm in fuzzy.
5,I Loved it!,"I'm a big Julia Quinn fan, and I felt like this was just as great as her other books. I loved the story. I see that a few reviewers thought that Miranda was too young and immature, but I didn't really feel that way. I thought that she just felt hurt when she didn't think that Turner loved her back. I won't summarize the story as others have already done that, but I will say that if you love Julia, then I think that you should enjoy this book as well. Great job Julia, keep it coming!!"
5,Another hit for Quinn!,"Alas, I have been waiting for this book for nearly a month...ahh JQ's books are great. She still held the humor in most of her books (like the Bridgerton novels and the spin offs). But it was as funny as were the tears dropping from your eyes. If you want a really emotional book, but with a humorous flare, this is a great book.The characters were well developed; along with liking the heroine and the heroe, Olivia is a great supporting character. Always there calling people: cows, goats and a lot more other interesting names. Anyway grab the book if you can...any thing from JQ is worth buying."
4,the secret diaries of miss miranda cheever.by julia quinn,I also like reading julia quinn books too.I also like books that have connecting characters in them.And i like this book.mags
3,Vey Cute story,"I did not enjoy this as much as JQ other stories, but I thought is was a nice read none the less. I find people keep having bad things to say about Miranda, that are not true. She was a much stronger person than people give her credit for. I can understand why she let her feelings be hurt by Turner, but as she matured she became her own person. She didn't wait around for Turner to rescue her, that I really respected. Worth the time to read!"
3,A Bit Disappointing!,"All I can say is there was a big disconnect between the two characters. The book was entertaining as all of Ms. Quinn's novels---funny to say the least. However, the the interplay was somehow disjointed. Oh well, maybe next time."
2,it pains me to give two stars- however i actually bought the book,"when i spend the money, i want to at least enjoy it...that said, normally I love julia quinn. but, this book was just- boring. i hate to say it- but julia can do much better than this. there were no sparks. i wasn't rooting for anyone. woman in that time sparkled much more by being defiant or different, not spouting political beliefs that sound inane and ridiculous in the context of the book."
2,pure fluff,"This story would have been an acceptable (but unexceptional) contribution to an anthology. If it had been 1/4 to 1/3 as long as it was, it wouldn't have felt so contrived. As it was, its one of those books that is mostly filler. The heroine is 20 but acts about l4. The hero, who wallows endlessly in self pity is, frankly, irritating. The supporting characters are fine, but add nothing. They pretty much enter the scene, say something, flutter about insignificantly, and exit-stage-left, like in a bad high-school play. The premise of the story line is cute, but can't carry a full length book. I couldn't form an attachment for either of the leads and kept wondering if they'd ever grow up. The book, as a whole, lacks character and substance and seems to have been written for melodramatic adolescents. Julia Quinn can and has done better, but she needs to work harder and not take her readers for granted."
2,SOO disappointing,"I was so excited when I heard that a new Julia Quinn was coming out that I preordered it. I've always enjoyed her funny, flippant characters that do not follow the plot line of every other romance book... But then I got it. It had very little clever conversation and most of the book was the melodramatic pap written by others with much less skill. It made me wonder if she had a ghost writer. If so, she should fire her. She would have been better waiting until she had the inspiration for a better book. I will be caution when buying her books in the future. Julia, how could you?"
2,Get out the cliche counter......,"Yes, I know romance novels are formulaic, but it's the twist the author puts on the formula that makes the difference for me. I've read all of Julia Quinn's books and enjoyed most of them, because she makes them original & entertaining. (To really see what Ms. Quinn is capable of, try Romancing Mr. Bridgerton.)I'm afraid Ms. Quinn just used the Romance writer's checklist for this one: Unattainable hero? Check. Bluestocking heroine adoring from afar? Check. Late-night drunken passion in the study? Check. More passion in the huting cabin during a rainstorm? Check. A near-death that makes the hero come to his sense? Check. Even the love scenes are bland.I'm giving 2 stars because the dialogue, as always, is witty, and Julia Quinn's mediocre is better than most other's best effort. I'm hoping for better next time."
2,only mediocre,"I normally love Julia Quinn's books, but this one fell flat for me. I could not get into it and considered putting it down several times. I was extremely upset that I bought this one new. My advice is to wait until you see it at the half price store. :("
2,Oh well! What a disappointment!,"I agree with Phillipa. She wrote a very complete review. For Ms. Quinn's fans, only borrow this from the library. Don't bother buying this turkey. It was soooo uneven."
5,Loved it!!!,"I love, love, loved, this book! Made me cry and smile. Kept me coming back to Julia Quinn for more."
3,"I liked it, didn't love it","Julia Quinn knows all the ways to get me caring about her characters. The protagonists are never one dimensional even if some side characters appear to be. She knows how to make me care about the feelings of our heroine when at the same time I understand our hero's actions even if I cannot approve.There is a bit of the ""soap-opera"" about this novel, overly dramatic at times but I can still forgive the dramatics because the romance is so delicious.This is perhaps not my favorite Quinn romance but I certainly liked it and recommend it.This book is also introducing characters that will appear in the next book in this series (the Bevelstoke Series). Each book is stand alone but it is nice to know the various family members."
5,Loved it,"I love Julia Quinn's witty historical romances, and have to disagree with many of the earlier reviewers of this particular book - I really enjoyed Turner and Miranda's story. Miranda is a charming and eminently relatable character. I love romances that begin with a crush from afar (and Turner is particularly crushworthy)."
3,JWhite,"I have always gone right out and bought Julia Quinns novels, and really enjoyed them. The first few books in the Bridgerton novels were keepers (The Viscount Who Loved Me, and The Duke and I) , but the last few were missing the humor and characters that you really cheer for. The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever is the same. Enjoyable, but not like some of her other novels. I am glad I have read the books, but it might not be reread and enjoyed as much as some of her other books."
3,A frothy read for a Summer's day,"This is not exactly War and Peace but a frothy romance novel with no unexpected outcomes. The characters are likeable and suitably confused but all ends happily, which is what we expected all along!"
2,Okay love story...annoying historical inaccuracies...,"I will admit that when I picked this book up I didn't know it was your standard romance novel, and I'm not a romance novel person (at least not romance novels from contemporary authors). By the description on the back cover I thought that the main character's diaries would play a much bigger part in the story...also, I was severely disappointed in how historically INaccurate so very many parts of this novel were. It was an okay light fluffy read but I wouldn't highly recommend it."
2,disappointing,"I've read and loved all of Julia Quinn's books, but not this one. Miranda wasn't much of a female lead. She seemed to be a somewhat vague and twit-like character. When she is told her father committed an unforgiveable crime, she doesn't even doubt the story, even though it's told to her by someone she doesn't like and who doesn't like her. She just goes along without much of an objection to the destruction of her life. NOT a keeper."
3,Wow not her best,I just got done with this book . The hole reason I picked it up was because it was a quinn. From the back I was like this sounds like a good read. I agree with others on this one
4,"Give Quinn Props (if only, for breaking the mould)","I agree with other reviewers - this is really a 3.5 book, but I am giving it 4 stars if only to reward Julia Quinn for having broken the now-tiresome pattern of so many other romance writers (I am talking to you, Stephanie Laurens, Nicole Jordan, Jo Beverley, etcetera) - i.e., repetitively writing the same basic story about the same characters and their increasingly irrelevant and tangential hangers-on, past the point of exhaustion. Plus - even at her flimsiest, Quinn writes more entertainingly than most other romance authors."
3,A light and easy read . . .,"I thought it would be a bit more in-depth, but, none-the-less it was an easy read, with some humor added in. I recommend it if you enjoy reading, because it has a nice storyline, and can be read through pretty fast. The heroine was a touch campy in her life-long obsession of the leading man, but still a good read."
2,Typical inane dialogue,"The only reason I ever pick up a Quinn novel (I haven't bothered for the last few years) is that the plot always sounds intriguing on the back of the book jacket. If she could just contain herself when writing dialogue, I would be more pleased with her books. As it is, the reader has to force herself to make it past the first 150 pages. Quinn tries so hard to write witty dialogue, but in reality, it just comes across as stupid. And for some reason, she seems to shove all this stupidity to the beginning of her novels. You want to give up reading long before wading through the inanity to get to the good part. She often redeems herself somwhat in the last 100 pages, as she does here, because Quinn finally becomes serious and moves her characters along without allowing them to talk as much. But, really, there is no reason to spend your good money on a Quinn novel. Go pick up a Mary Balogh or Jo Beverley book if you want to read truly gifted Regency writers."
2,Two thumbs down,"I like Julia Quinn a lot. However, why do I think she became busy with other endeavors and farmed this out to an inept ghost writer? 1.) the dialogue was inane. 2.) After our heroine snares the hero all she does is whine about why he doesn't love her. Puhleeze! 3.)I did not connect with the characters. ABout the only one I was interested in was the heroine's best friend, Olivia, who also happens to be the hero's little sister. 4.) The plot consisted of the heroine pining for the hero.Do not buy this if you have never read Julia Quinn. I would wait until it is in a used book store or skip it and wait for her next offering."
2,disappointing...and i love julia quinn...,"i am a big fan of julia quinn...but this book just left me irritated. it's hard to like a book when you don't like the main characters. i can say with certain feeling that i did not like the hero AT ALL. he had that ""i know what's best for you"" attitude and was overly arrogant and selfish until the last few pages...and to me being redeemed within 5 pages of ending doesn't make me like him any more than i did at the beginning. the heroine was too meek and blindly followed anyone (mostly the ""hero"") who told her what to do. it seemed unrealistic that a child-love/crush from one nice comment could actually survive all of the hero's selfish ways and cruel behaviors; any woman i know would wash her hands clean of the man and move on. i hope ms. quinn's next novel is as good as all her others."
2,"Why Julia, why?","It is my understanding that this book had been in the mothballs for several years and Ms. Quinn decided to do a re-write, fluff it up as it were and release it. I wish that she had never done it, I have read all of her books, not only the Bridgerton series, but Minx, How to marry a Marquess and so forth, she should be ashamed to have attached her name to this, it is so foolish, no real conflict or plot, it does remind me of someones first draft. She should have burned it. I hope her next book is new and she uses the talent she now possesses"
4,A good read.,"I wasn't impressed with the last two Julia Quinn books but that didn't stop me from buying her latest. I have to say it was definitely a step up from On the Way to the Wedding and To Sir Phillip, With Love. And while it wasn't as good as The Viscount Who Loved Me, When He Was Wicked, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton and all her really early work, it was an enjoyable read. I liked Turner right from the beginning and I liked Miranda but eventually she began to grate. They were going to get married after he compromised her and that was fine with her but then everything confusingly shifted when all of a sudden she wouldn't marry him unless he loved her, not at all understanding that he'd been burned once and didn't want it to happen again. And then everything shifted again when she married him anyway. But all in all, it was a pretty good read."
2,"I wanted to like this one, I really did!","I don't understand how this author continues to write some disappointing stuff, yet it all gets published. I forced myself to finish this even though I found both characters hopeless after a while. I think I'm going to sell all my copies of her books at my next yard sale."
1,"Jane Austen, my foot!","The cover art and come-ons got me. ""This generation's Jane Austen."" Please, never ever do that to me again. I agree with all the negative reviews. This book was terrible."
3,Pretty good but not the best,"This wasn't bad but it wasn't fabulous either.I enjoyed it and will keep it on my bookshelf. However, it wasn't Julia's best work.For first time readers of Julia Quinn, i think that they will love it."
3,3 1/2 stars...,"This book was ok. The characters seemed to do things that were out of character for them and that was a bit disconcerting. However, there were some funny moments and overall, I liked the characters. Not the best book, but not the worst either."
3,Secret Diaries,"I thought this book was a great fluff read, I liked that it was more about the couple than a sub plot. I also liked that Miranda didn't want to marry Turner right away. Loved that she stuck up for herself and knew what she wanted."
3,Not the best...but not the worst,"I'd say this is more a 3 and a half star book. They banter was witty, the plot moved quickly (too quickly maybe?) and I happen to be a sucker for the plotline (crush on the older, more worldly man). As other reviewers did, I have some issues though. First, Miranda's hero-worship never quite matures into a believable love. Second, I feel that losing a baby should have caused more emotion. It's traumatic no matter what the circumstances and I thought it coldly written off.Third, Turner treated Miranda horribly after they were intimate and should have been made to grovel. It should also have taken Miranda longer to give in. But even so it was an enjoyable read that just never quite lived up to it's potential."
4,"Really 3 1/2 Stars....Ho Hum, Need a Book To Publish Book","""The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever"" lacked the sparkle and wit that Julia Quinn creates in her books. The chemistry between Miranda and Turner never sparked or crackled, it was always at a mellow hum. The passion seemed to be on the side of lacking, there was anger, but not the passion typical of the genre. The book had its pleasing moments. I found the last 75 pages or so very compelling, the only part of the book that I could not put down, but I felt like I had to drudge through a lot to get there. Quinn was very redundant in her writing, restating and restating things, I wondered if she had forgotten that she had already written similar statements and feelings."
5,Julia Quinn--she never lets you down--really good book,"really good book--Julia does it again!! As Always.The Bookseller got it to me quickly. The book is in good, very good condition."
5,I absolutely adored this book...,"...and I didn't think I would, because I had gotten very tired of the Bridgerton clan, and I was a wee bit afraid maybe Julia Quinn was beginning to lose her marvelous sparkle and charm. But ""The Secret Diaries"" won me over. I'm a sucker for little girls having crushes on kind older men (see ""Memoirs of a Geisha"") so the book grabbed me from the start. The stories I love best are always character driven, not plot driven, and I was totally captivated by both hero and heroine. Over the past two years I've read more than 400 romance novels, and this was the first time I've cried happy tears at the ending of any of them. A real winner, Julia Quinn, and thank you for giving me a wonderful read. Come winter time I'll be picking this off my ""keeper"" shelf and cuddling up with this book again."
2,Not a bad book just not a good book,"This book was so predictable there is nothing special about the plot it has been done to death. There is no chemistry between the main characters. When I read a romance, I want heat and chemistry not a lukewarm liking. The first half of the book was so slow I found myself skimming passages. The second half of the book was better, but still didn't make the book worth the purchase price."
4,Another winner! I enjoyed it!,"I'm fairly new to Julia Quinn's work. I enjoyed the book. I truly liked the heroine, the hero wasn't the typical cookie-cutter perfect gentleman, and without spoiling, the heroine showed a bit of backbone that was refreshing.I know I'll read it again. Good job, Ms. Quinn!"
4,ENGAGING...,Mr. Darnell Fountain has a remarkable ability to convey the truth about life... His poetry is stiched together to create stories of truth... This book took me into a new journey of understanding.
2,Not what I expected,I was anxious to receive and read this book. Historical Books about real heros are my favorite. I found this book very hard to read and it wasn't interesting to me. It was one factual rescue recitation after the other with no real story to weave it together. Harriet Tubman was truly a hero.....but the book to me was not interesting. There was nothing new to be learned about the era or the rescue effort of the slaves. Maybe it was the way the book was written; but it did not appeal to me or hold my interest.
5,Defines the phrase strong woman!,"Bought this book just to read more about Harriet Tubman, never have read a book on just had read books where she is mentioned before and wanted to learn more. What a fascinating woman and what she did at times I thought don't do that you're going to caught and she didn't. She was truly a generous person and cared not just her family but anyone who needed help, til the end of slavery; 'Mother Moses' kept doing it after and never thought she had done enough."
1,just started,"Have not had a chance to read this book. Actually, after the first page, I was not motivated to continue reading. Skipped to the last few pages and enjoyed them."
5,I cannot imagine Harriet's life.,"This book is amazing. The life of one person who saved many. A woman who put her life behind all of those she saved. I cannot imagine walking all those miles that she covered through the darkness of the night through the forests and woods, in the dead of winter. As I read this book I tried to imagine and I could not. I feel the cold of the day with a coat and fur boots and try to imagine Harriet walking from the Maryland to Canada or from Massachusetts to Canada. I cannot."
3,Interesting glimpse of history almost as it happened,"This relatively small book provides a large glimpse into life immediately after the Civil War, especially the efforts of one woman and the many people who admired and supported her. I had no idea that Harriet Tubman had served as a Union spy and nurse, nor did I know about her brain injury as a child. I encourage you to read about this courageous woman, who earned great admiration and yet retained her modesty and humility, even though her country did not give her the money and respect she earned and deserved."
3,A Black Woman who left her mark on history.,"Harriet Tubman was born to a free man and a slave woman. Her life was hard and she abhorred slavery for her people. She sustained a head injury while helping an escaping slave. Her free Black husband was not supportive of her activities. Learning she was to be sold, Harriet planned an escape, however her brothers made her return. She finally did escape, using the underground railroad. Harriet was a family woman, and could not rest until she helped her sister and brother escape. The Blacks truly considered her their female version of the Biblical Moses."
5,Harriet Tubman,"This was a wonderful book about an amazing lady. Her courage was amazing, to think of returning time after time to rescue others. She truly was the Moses of her people."
2,admirable woman,Too much repetition in the book for me. Too same same. Not very well written book. no more to say about it
3,Things I didn't learn in history class,I loved that the book provided information that I did not learn in history class. It gave me a deeper understanding and appreciation of this remarkable woman
3,Interesting account of Tubman's journey,"I enjoyed the historical narration that Susan Bradford uses in telling the reader about Harriett Tubman's drive for freedom. However, I felt the book repeated itself too many times and that I was re-reading Bradford's notes too many times. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in learning more about Tubman's role in the Underground Railroad."
4,"Harriet, the Moses of Her People","I have always admired Harriet Tubman, and it was enlightening to read things from her own journal and letters written about her. JB"
5,life in that day,This is a very interesting book telling the real story of what it was like to try to help slaves escape their masters. This is also about a person who cared more about overs then herself. She got by with the the help of God and friends
2,Harriet Tubman - The Moses of Her People,"Interesting book about a courageous woman, but kept repeating facts over and over. Pictures on a regular Kindle are not detailed enough to appreciate."
3,Harriet Tubman - The Moses of Her People,"Easy reading - takes you back to tougher times, about a women who was able to overcome many obstacles to help her people."
5,Harriet Moses of her people,This is a easy to read story of Harriet Tubman. Some pictures are helpful to the story. Enjoyed. Wish there was more well written about Harriet.
4,Very good,Something to really learn about your history. And also to learn how great of a woman Harriet Tubman was. Good read!
4,Seems Tough Enough,"It works, bringing stereo down to one channel. It's hard and feels like it would be hard to break. Had no problems with connectors not fitting like other reviews. Not much else to say."
1,Defective and Cheap,Totally defective. Returned it. I will just go to my local RadioShack for a cheaper one that actually works.Cons:Very cheap lookingLoose in the plugDEFECTIVE!Pros:I can return it for a refund.
1,Don't Bother,"The first unit was a dud, the connect female hole was not a snug fit.Returned it and got the second one, same thing. This product does not deserve the one star, but I had to tag a start so I can write this review."
1,you get what you pay for,"I ordered this mono adaptor because the one I had from Radio Shack stopped working. I have a somewhat unique problem in that I am deaf in one ear. Therefore stereo headphones where the source is truly stereo cause me to lose 1/2 the music, or hear it as very muffled and far away. Solution: a mono adaptor. This one arrived with the plastic housing cracked. I didn't notice that at first and plugged it in to my computer to listen to jazz on Pandora. Although it worked, it required that I bring the volume WAY up. The sound was so washed out that it was like listening to an ancient transistor radio. Would not recommend."
4,Sweet little antique book,"I stumbled on book three of this series in an antique store and promptly scoured the internet for the other two books. They're sweetly written, with gorgeous 30s illustrations. If you're interested in how we taught kids in the old days, this series is a beauty."
1,Extremely Disappointing Dictionary,"Want to know a word in Polish? Using Larousse:1. Look up the English word.2. See how to pronounce it. (The English word, that is.)3. See the spelling of the translated word in Polish.That's it!Doughnut [pronounciation here] n. peczek, m.No pronunciation of the word you are searching for.Most people looking for a language translation don't need the pronunciation of the word they are using to look up, but want the pronunciation in Polish. And ... the Polish word is NOT even listed in the Polish listing of words! (No peczek. No wszy.)Don't waste your money on this one. It isn't for beginners. I guess the Polish-English half is good to read a newspaper in Polish (but then you only need half the book!)."
2,Only Good for Beginners,"I hate to rate this guitar low, but quite seriously I was disappointed with it from day one. The sound quality is not good, it is not a quality guitar. I eventually changed out the cheap low cost tuners and replaced them with premium tuners. I also changed out the cheap plastic nut and bridge and installed a bone nut and bridge. These changes made the instrument bearable for a while. In time however, after I got used to the instrument, as opposed to a normal 6 string guitar, the lack of sound quality became insurmountable. I still have the guitar sitting in a corner, but I've since changed over to a Seagull Mahogany CW that I modified to a tres configuration, played with a capo on the second fret. The sound is way better. Buyer beware."
5,One of the best CDs I own!!!!,"This CD is truly one of the best CDs that I own.....thats basically the idea I would like to get out there! I listen to it 24/7 and I never get tired of the insightful lyrics or the awesome tunes and musically inclined guitar solos, etc. The thing that makes it even more great is the fact that it is Christian...with Jesus, anything is possible. Thats what the focus ofC this band is, for those who dont realize...to make music (doing what they love to do) but more to spread the word that God loves you, and that they love to make music BECAUSE of God...this CD rules!!!! Buy it if possible, and enjoy it!"
3,mild dissapointment,"I was mildly dissapointed by this cd. I have listened to it many times because a close friend suggested I buy it. The lead singer has a great voice and several, not most, of the songs are fantastic (such as the opener, 2 and 4). But other tracks made me think I was listening to my little brother's backstreet boys cd. I could not believe some of the songs on this album. I would steer clear of this one, in favor of a different The Juliana Theory album."
2,Very disappointing,"This cd is one of my most regrettable recent purchases, and a good example why you should listen to an entire album before making the decision to purchase it. From just the reviews, I expected this cd to be great. Well, if you like NSYNC and mainstream power-pop, Juliana Theory is actually better than most of their peers. But if you loathe that division of the record industry, this cd is not for you. Don't just take my word for it, though... listen to a copy at your local used-cd store and make up your own mind."
4,dont See them live,"I have this CD, and i liked it, and then i went to see them live, and now i dont, they just arent the same live"
3,Very emtional and beautiful,"This is very emtional and beautiful c.d. lyric-wise and music-wise. Although the lyrics are fairly simplistic, you can tell that they put a lot of thought into each of their songs. They don't necissarily have a distinct sound, but for them, that is a good thing. You can tell they they serve each song and don't try to label them selfs as 'Emo' or 'Punk' or anything like that. This a a good c.d. to wind down to."
5,Awesome cd,This cd is awesome. The songs are extremely emotional and have great music accompanying them. I definitely recommend this cd to any emo fan out there.
5,Why is the girl on the cover SAD?,"Wow. Amazing album by those guys called The Juliana Theory. They write catchy pop songs (that sometimes come dangerously close to NSync), but yet bold rocky ones, too. I heard somewhere that the lead singer was in one of those scream-your-head-off hardcore bands, and I'm not surprised. Worth the price alone for the song ""If I Told You This Was Killing Me, WOuld You Stop?"" Buy this CD now, or else go buy one by Starflyer 59."
1,emo is dead because you killed it,"Juliana Theory is not a bad band. ""Emotion is Dead"", is, however, a horrible record that sounds as though it was targeted to pre-teen girls. I'm guessing that this was an attempt to get famous, which the band most likely regrets; because I recently read on the Tooth and Nail website that the band themself ARE NEVER GOING TO MAKE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS AGAIN. Again, they said that. Hopefully they will return to the days of ""Understand this Is A Dream"" on their next release."
4,amazing cd,"Lately I've been wasting all my money on cd's. I went to a cd store just browsing under punk/emo section and saw The Juliana Theory- Emotion is Dead. I remembered my friend talking about how good they were so I decided to take the chance. I was so blown away. I seriously had this cd in my stereo for 1 week or 2 straight. Brett Detar has the most beautiful singing voice ever and mostly all the songs are great. There are songs that are fast and upbeat and others that are slow. But hey, a little slow, mellow music won't hurt you. I'm pretty sure anyone who gets this cd would really like it just as much as I did. My fave songs on the album are:1.Into the Dark--2.Don't Push Love Away--4.We're at the top of the world--5.Is patience still waiting? ** best song on the album11. This is your life--really really slow song at first then gets faster12. You always say goodnight, goodnight-- slow song as well.. but a good way to end the album"
4,Forget everything you thought you knew about TJT.,"1 word can be used to describe this album: Different. Even the version of ""If I Told You This Was Killing Me....."" is different than it was on the EP, with wacky effects and stuff. I don't really know what to think, I love it but it's missing something very important that Understand this is a Dream had, I don't know what it is, I want to say passion, but not really. I've come to the conclusion that the Juliana Theory's goal is to keep people on edge, and make them freak out whenever they hear new stuff. I don't know.....it's not Understand this is a Dream, but I think that TJT has reached their goal of what they wanted to do. And if they're happy then so am I. Now I realize who they remind me of musically on the new album: Third Eye Blind. Take that for what it's worth."
4,Emo - Not Punk,"It seems a lot of people can't tell the difference between emo and punk, and I guess hardcore fans are the only exception. But that's not really the point, except that The Juliana Theory is of the ""emo"" genre, period.""Into the Dark"" and ""We're Nothing Without You"" are songs that pull at the heart, while ""To The Tune of 50,000 Screaming Children"" and ""If I Told You This Was Killing Me"" are fast-paced, if not equally thought-provoking.This CD shouldn't be labeled and aimed at a specific group of people. I know older people (guys included) that listen to and enjoy TJT. There's no limit to who can or should listen to a band or genre of music."
4,American Hi-Fi meets Pink Floyd meets Mudvayne,"I like this because it's very emo (American Hi-Fi), trippy (Pink Floyd) and punk rawk (Mudvayne). Or is that the other way around? Oh well. I think that this is a very musically complicated album, and I appreciate the Juliana Theory's use of eighth notes. It's much much better than using stupid sell out 16th notes (Knapsack). Brett Detar frightens me, and so does Not Brett Detar. I'd rank this right below Good Charlotte in my collection, but I think higher than KoRn, but only Life Is Peachy (what a bad album) but this is a TJT review, not KoRn. It's emo and so am I. Misfits!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Cheese Explosion,"The first song was catchy enough for me to ignore the lyrics, but when they finally broke into sha-la-las, my will broke. There is no exuse for that. The music is sometimes compelling, but the band has the heart of the Backstreet Boys. The ""hard"" songs are undermined by the inherent softness of the band. Remember when the NKOTB sang ""Oh oh oh oh oh, we're rough!""? It's a lot like that. If you're not a 12 year old girl, I'd stay away."
1,i hate these guys..,I HATE THIS GUYS. They are ugly and mean and i have the same pants as them!!!!!!!
5,juliana theory emotion is dead,this is one of the best cds i have ever heard!!!i had never heard of it till somebody gave it to me an i havent put it down since the cd is a lot of hard stuff an then fininshes off with slower songs but theyre awesome!! i highly reccomend this cd! i have about 70 cds an this is probably the second or third favorite cd i own. i have givin this cd to my friends an they have said nothin but good things about it!
2,i wish guys with talent would stop (stinking),"in an obvious ""up yours"" to past fans/detractors, the negative vibe that started emanating from Brett and Co. a few years ago continues on this record. if you're expecting more of what you heard on ""understand..."" (which, though not completely original, was still enjoyable), turn around and walk disgustedly in the other direction. one of the songs is called ""the dream is over"", if i remember correctly. you figure it out.the best i can say about this is that it's mid to high-quality radio pop. maybe the newest one will be better. i don't care how unpopular it is to not like these guys right now. they deserve whatever criticism they get."
1,Not what I expected,I bought this dvd for my daughter who adores The Wizard Of Oz. I didn't know it's a silent film. Definetely uninteresting for kids.
5,What a laugh!,"This hat has 2 major side effects:1: One can not help but laugh when they see someone (including themselves) in this hat.2: One can not help but recite from Monty Python And The Holy GrailNerds, geeks, or like me, super geeks, will love this item. NOT for kids! They tend to want to ram the horns into things or people...so they either hurt you, or themselves... one is funnier than the other. Guess which?"
3,boring,"I am disappointed in the quality of the art, as I was expecting something much more realistic, not so impressionistic. Other than that, there isn't much to say about a calendar."
4,Certainly Worth Reading,"I just finished How To Be An Effective Manager by Greg Blencoe and while simply written, it certainly makes a point. In my younger years there were certainly many family run business and businesses in general that could have learned a lot from this book.I would certainly suggest that family companies could benefit from the book. Most family companies that I have seen have no plan for the businesss. It just sort of happens. Especially when the businesses get to the point where they need some managerial experience (either by hiring within the company or from outside sources). By reading and implementing the suggestions of the book, family businesses could run much smoother.I would also suggest that new managers in general would benefit as well. This would be a great book that a new manager (with no previous experience and his/her supervisor could discuss."
4,"This is a ""must read"" for owners & successors of family cos","We were fortunate to be able to publish individual articles based on the book in our online newsletter during 2001. In speeches at trade association events I was very pleased when someone came up to me and reminded me of the fact. And told me how important the lessons were to them.Our subscribers are the owners and successors of family owned companies where often doing what's right (management wise) is often overlooked for family reasons(Firing your son-in-law is a tough one). The articles, and now the book, have given the owners support in making the otherwise difficult decisions.Wayne Messick, FounderFamily Business Strategieshttp://www.FBNews.net"
5,What a talent!,"I originally bought this DVD-A disk for my Mom, who is very religious. I listened to it at her house and immediately knew I had to have a copy. I've always know what a unique and beautiful voice Neville has, but I'm not a huge fan of religious music (other than Christmas music). This is just great music. Period. Some songs are superb and some are merely very good. Not a single bad song in the bunch. The teriffic surround sound makes the album that much more enjoyable. Also check out the Neville DVD-A ""Believe,"" it is just a good as this one, but with completely different songs. What a talented performer!"
5,Aaron Neville,"Having been fortunate to have been old enough to know music from the 60's, 70's and 80's (Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed disco !), I always enjoyed Aaron Neville's voice,whether it be solo or with his brothers. Now that I am a christian, this cd blows me away ! Having been through the highs and lows that are very similar to his(I am an ex-meth cook and also spent a lot of time in prison, I can only agree with him wholeheartedely ""I OWE IT ALL TO JESUS"""
5,inspiring,You can't listen to this collection of songs without being inspired to be a better person and help make this a better world for others.
3,It does the job and thats's all.,I bought this bit as it is equivalent to a 35mm bit used to install standard cabinet hinges. One problem is that you must guage the depth as the bit is not the standard thickness. Generally when a forstner bit reachs the depth where the top of the drill head is level with the surface of the wood the depth is correct for consealed hinges; not so with this product. The thinner head also tends to walk a bit if you are not using a drill press so you must be careful to line the bit up 90 Deg to the wood surface. This bit will do the job but if you must make alot of holes without the aid of a drill press don't even think about it! The bit seems sharp but doesn't have the normal saw tooth cutting edge around the periphery and because of that I tend to think that perhaps this tool won't stay as sharp as long.
5,"Excellent, Practical Guide for Elder-Led Churches!","Our church (a large one) has been moving from a Sr. Pastor model of church leadership to an Elder-Led model. This book has turned out to be a gold mine of practical information for us! From the biblical basis for multiple leadership, to how elders are to function, to how staff and elders relate--this book covers many of those difficult issues an elder-led church must deal with.I would highly recommend this book whether you are already functioning under an elder-led model, or whether you are reconsidering your current structure. This book challenges the prevailing thinking regarding church leadership, giving us a more biblical alternative to the common Sr. Pastor model."
1,waste of time,"It seems like your wife and your son and his wife being so kind to you, but the truth is that your book is not interesting and it is a waste of time. I do not recommend this book or any other book you write or co-author."
2,"Maybe 30% useful, a lot of wasted pages","It took 2-3 chapters to get past cutesy ""nothing"" garbage. The whole ""nothing"" thing was very annoying. Too much ""more on this later"", and a lot of irrelevant stuff as well. If you thought this book would be interesting you've probably already read better coverage of most of what's in it. Get Brian Greene's book, or read it again if you already have it. I suspect K.C. had more fun researching it than anyone will have reading it."
1,What a disappointment!,"I was hoping for a layman's review of the latest findings in cosmology. Instead I got a completely disorganized mish mash of random quotes from scientists (seemed to be the author's attempt to curry favor with those she may need for future articles) and endless puns on the word ""nothing"". Unlike the Universe, her book has no discernable structure, and NO attempt to clearly explain any of the new concepts (string theory, anti-matter etc.)."
1,Boring and off the topic,this book is so boring and anyone without any education can write a book like this.
2,Not your average Clarks,"I own many much pair of Clark's shoes and this style is narrower than the average Clark shoes. The center decoration that holds the shoe upper together makes the show have less flexibility than normal Clarks. If your foot is slightlynarrorer than a medium width, this is the shoe for you."
4,I Love These Shoes,"I have these in white and I love them! I've been wearing them everyday. They are so comfortable and I get lots of compliments on them. These are my first pair of Clarks so I don't know about how the sizes normally run. I usually end up buying a size 10 shoe, but say I am really a 9.5 wide (when I can find that size). These are a 9.5 wide and fit great. The only negative thing about these shoes is that the first few days I wore them, they pinched the top of my foot between the two pieces of leather. Some other reviewers complained about their heels rolling off the inside of these. I frequently have that problem, but not with these shoes at all, go figure. I would recommend these shoes. I just love mine."
2,Cute; if you're going to prom....,"I was totally disappointed when I tried these on, they look like prom shoes. The rhinestone buckle clinches it, the stlye is very high school trying to look older. On the bright side, the shoes are well made and true to size. I sent them back though."
5,Frampton comes Alive: 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition,It sounds very good in SACD Format. Also the newly added Songs are good too.
4,This one should have came free with a subsription to Rolling Stone,"One thing is true about Frampton by far, he was a lot better live than in studio, go figure, it's suppose to be the other way around. This whole album kicks serious butt, but the reason for 4 stars is would be for the fact the monsters from radio constantly replays the usuals on this set of his live concerts from 1975. The highlight of this album as any classic rock lover would know is Do You Feel Like I Do, all thirteen minutes of it, don't ever get sick of that. I grew up hearing Show Me The Way, and of course another favorite on this album Baby, I Love Your Way. The other tracks on this album are packed with a punch too including Shine On, (I'll Give You) Money, and slower pace Lines On My Face. If you still have this on vinyl, save that needle and pick this gem up on CD and as always, ENJOY!!!"
5,This album never sounds dated,This album never seems to become out of date. I guess it is the unique guitar sound and the range of musical styles that always keeps it fresh.From rock numbers to more mellow songs the quality is consistant. PF is a guitar legend combined with a versatile singing voice makes this a must have album for me. Get a piece of music history- get this album into your collection.
5,Love that Wah-Wah!,"Show me the way is my favorite. ""Ah wan chu-u-u ... to show me the way."" Love that talky wah-wah guitar. It never, ever gets old. Somehow these songs make me feel like there are 99,999 other people in an arena with me and it's 1976 all over again. I also downloaded Baby I love your way, but nothing else from Comes Alive (although I still might, it would be fun to have Do you feel like we do). I also like his Live in Detroit, but there is nothing in the world like Comes Alive.When Comes Alive came out, people who liked Humble Pie and live Cream wondered if Comes Alive was too accessible, too pop. It is, kinda, but you can't help being blown away by the incredible energy, the showmanship, the sincerity and his overwhelming chops, plus the super-tight band. And then there's that talky wah-wah thing. You just gotta surrender and love it. Come on, show me that air guitar. Nice moves!"
5,This is one of the greatest selling live albums for a reason.,"This album is amazing. I'm only 23, so this music is way before my time (I never even heard of Peter Frampton until 2005). I kept hearing it's one of the best selling live albums ever, and after hearing it, it's for a darn good reason. The production quality is crystal clear, the songs are classics, and it's just a blast to listen to over and over! Everyone should own this album for it truly stands the test of time."
5,Frampton Comes Alive,"Lots of Great Songs to Go Along with Lots of Great Memories!! Honestly, it is as good as you remember."
4,Frampton Comes Alive Take 2,Frampton Comes Alive Vinyl on 180 Gram blows away the original LP I have in mint condition from the week it came out. The staple of the 1970s. A time I miss ...But relive through this great sound vinyl record.
5,Classic tracks from a classic 70's album!,"Nobody does it better than this classic live 70's album! The energy and unique style cannot be copied, only admired! If you want to capture the essence of the 1970's music scene this is the one for yoU!"
3,Humble Pie Live At The Fillmore Is So Much Better...,This Album Is Way Overated....Peter Is A Great Guitar. Player...But..The Live Stuff He Did With Humble Pie Is So Much Better..Really
3,PETER FRAMPTON LIVE,"THIS ALBUM COULD HAVE HAD MORE ATTENTION TO IT. THE FIRST 2 SONGS YOU'LL NOTICE DROP OUTS. IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY USED A CASSETTE TO RECORD THIS ON CD. SHOW ME THE WAY DID NOT SOUND AS GREAT. BUT AFTER THAT IT WAS OK. I GOT THE MOBILE FADELITY SOUND RECORDING OF THIS ALBUM AND THE CROWD SOUNDS LIKE THERE INSIDE A BULIDING INSTEAD OF OUTDOORS. IT'S OUTSTANDING THE ONE TO OWN. OUT-OF-PRINT THOUGH. THIS ONE REVIEW SAID SHE SAWE IT LIVE. IT WAS NOT ALL RECORDED IN ONE PLACE. IT WAS TAKEN FROM DIFFERENT CONCERTS. BUT IT IS NOT FAKE. I WENT TO A PETER FRAMPTON CONCERT IN 1997. A LITTLE RUSTY. BUT NOT BAD. ONE SONG HE HATED TO DO IS (DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE DO). THAT IS THE MOST REQUESTED SONG AT EVERY CONCERT. I LIKE, I WANNA GO TO THE SUN, I'LL GIVE YOU MONEY, LINES ON MY FACE AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE DO. THEM ARE MY TOP SONGS."
2,OVER RATED,"This is not that great. I grew up in the 1970s and alway thought it was over rated. You know why this album got big, b/c the casual music fans (especially girls) that were really not into buying albums...this was their live album. They never knew about classic live albums w/energy like Deep Purple ""made in japan"", LEd Zep ""song remains the same"", Stones ""get your ya yas out"", Who ""live at Leeds"", Thin Lizzy ""live and dangerous"" and every 70's artist that released the obligatory double live album, they didn't know about these classic works.Frampton's music is decent (""Do you feel like we do"" is great!) but the other material is not that great.You make think I am wrong but maybe that is why Frampton came quickly and tne went just as quickly. He was a corporate pushed fad!Frampton was always a quality guitar slinger, legit artist but this just is not that great of a live album. Does anybody really listen to this from start to finish?"
3,Good Music But...,"The albums not even live? What the heck? all the tracks on here were recorded in the studio and then they ADDED crowd noises and clips from other shows. What A RIP OFF!, i mean even the musics just OK the only worhtwile songs on here are Do You Feel Like We Do and Show Me The WAy"
2,Quite Bad,"I just can't imagine listening to it again. I could swear I hear some yodeling in the background. He sure does know his ukelele though. OK, OK, the xylophone stuff is pretty good. The spoons and bells are alright too. I just think it's prententious and arrogant. The banjo doesn't even work! Oh, and that harpsicord! Just awful! It sounds like he has one of those vibrating things for his throat. I geuss it has it's moments - but not vary many of them."
5,I feel like i do!,"I never really had the opportunity to listen to frampton's stuff but my coworker (i'll call him ""Dubord"") raves about him. I thought ""Dubord"" was full of it until he let me borrow his LP of ""frampton comes alive"". man, i can tell you, it was musical nirvana. I am continuually awestruck by his talent on the guitar and his amazing tone. He is a top notch musician with an impressive knowledge and mastery of his instrument. (Frampton, not dubord. although dubord is good too but plays a different instrument all together and in general, has less commercial success in the music industry)now when I hear frampton at work it makes me happy. i do feel like i do. yeah baby"
5,BEST FRAMPTON EVER with one small issue . . .,"I won't blather on and on about how awesome Frampton Comes Alive is - that has been done with vinyl, cassette, CD, and now SACD releases. It's simply the best live concert recording EVER!My only complaint comes about packaging of this disc set. Why spread both Stereo and Surround tracks over two discs? The simple plan should have been to put the Stereo mix on one SACD and the Surround mix on the other. I want to cue this up in my player, sit back, and listen to Frampton Comes Alive! all the way through. With this set split over 2 discs as it is I have to swap discs midway through the performance."
4,Great mindless guitar rock,"For a listner who first experienced rock and roll two decades after this double cd was published, I was pleastenly suprised by what I found in Frampton's music. The lyrics are a different story, serving only to weigh down what what otherwise be great rock instrumentals. Don't purchase it expecting Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell; the best talking Frampton delivers comes from his guitar during the epic ""Do you feel like we do."" Do expect some of the best rock of the 70's, music that would move entire arenas even today"
2,Not happy,I thought I was getting the entire album. I only got the second album of the recording. I should have bee informed it was not the entire album!
3,Not any better than the original,"I was pretty disappointed in the quality of this release. There is too much noise that should have been filtered out in the remastering. I was expecting it to be cleaned up versus the original LP. IMO, not worthy of a deluxe edition.Having said that, the live performace is top-notch and the extra tracks are nice."
4,"Great, Timeless, Never Losses The Enjoyment OF Listening","I have listened to this album several times, and it is always a joy, it never lets you get bored. I am just 15 and I love this album, its is one of my favorites. The talent really shows on the guitar players(or at least my) favorite track, ""Do You Feel Like We Do."" This is a total joy to listen to if you like anything intrecate. GO BUY IT"
3,why i thought it was ok,"I liked what I received, however, it was supposed to be a 2 disc set, but I only got one. You did, refund my money though."
1,Yawn,"I could never understand why this album was so popular when it first came out and still can't, after all these years, understand why this live performance is so beloved by so many people. It's annoying in the way the audience responds so admiringly to the mediocre performance. So pretentious and corny. I swear everyone must have been high or brainwashed on a Peter Frampton acceptance drug given to them before the concert. Boring. And to think that this is one of the top selling live records of all time.....jeeez."
2,peter frampton live is the best live album of all times,THANKS PETER FOR THIS GREAT MASTERPIECE. I HAD TOO RATE IT 2. BECAUSE OF THEM USEING THE HDCD. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE DECODER ON YOUR EQUITMENT TO HEAR THE TRUE SOUND. ALSO I NOTICED SOME DROP OUTS IN THE RECORDING. THE BEST WAY TO GO IS GET THE MFSL RECORDING. NO DROP OUTS. SHARP CRISP SOUND. I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPED.
3,I just don't get it!,"While this is a fairly good record, I just don't get why it receives all of the praise it gets. ""The Allman Brothers Live At The Fillmore East"", ""One More From the Road"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, and ""The Who Live at Leeds"" are three of the live records that are better. Even the live Humble Pie record that Frampton was on leaves this in the dust. I've had this recording in some form (LP, CD) since it was released and it seldom finds it's way to my play list. As I said earlier this is a fairly good record but the best live record ever, PLEASE!"
2,Classic Rock,"Received CD in a timely manner, but damaged. Emailed customer service, but never received a response. The other CD received with this was fine. Not sure though if I'd buy from them again."
1,Absolutely Felt Ripped Off,"All that was sent was Volume 2, which meant I did not get the first side of the album (Baby I Love Your Way, side one, was what my wife wanted). No follow up by seller at all and Amazon just said they were sorry. My first bad experience with Amazon, but it truly stunk -"
3,This isn't by AM Cassandre,If you look closely at the lower left-hand corner you'll see the signature of the designer: Pierre Fix-Masseau
4,Anishinabemowin,"This is, as the title suggests, a concise dictionary. Ojibwe is a complex language with many regional dialects. This is a good beginner reference, light weight and easy to carry."
4,concise,This is an excellent book particularly for people who live in areas that blushing is more of an oddity beacuse of skin color. It truly helps for people to see that they are not alone with this problem. It has concise helpful tips for overcoming shyness.
3,Interesting content; writing style less so,"This book is an interesting and concise overview of Joss Whedon and his work and life. As an avid Buffy fan, I enjoyed reading about Joss's inspirations and paths which led him to create the wonderful shows he had created. However, I found the writing style to be very basic and uninspired, reminding me of biographies I read in elementary school. This book merely tells the story, without taking the time to write with elegance or engaging prose."
4,Rather fluffy,"An interesting but somewhat fluffy look at Joss Whedon's career. This book has the same almost naive as the Mary Tyler Moore biography I read last year. The book was written at a time when Buffy and Angel were both on the air. Firefly though floundering was still on the air but there's no mention of the upcoming film, Serenity.What the book doesn't admit to is the possibility that Joss could burn out -- which it appears he has from recent interviews. Joss is clearly very driven and clearly loves his work but does he know how to slow down?I found the insights into the storylines fascinating. Joss clearly lives by the adage of ""write what you know"" and it shows in his work."
2,What Yoga Becomes,"Lilias takes the maturation of compassion and wisdom into a practice that can be simply used. Drawing on her profound and singular path to yoga, and charted with descriptions of deeply personal lessons, she offers instruction that is as layered as it is clear, creating a guide for peace seekers of all stripes.==Carrie Schneider, author, ""American Yoga,"" ""Yoga Within""; carrieyoga.com"
5,Opens new doors,"Lilias' new book is a joy to read because of her way of making the reader feel like an old friend. Within that atmosphere she opens doors to subjects that may have seemed difficult to understand. In particular, this book gives an in depth view of the ""koshas""--the veils that cover our true selves--and shows how, in practical ways we may move through them. She also makes the practice of hatha yoga and meditation an attractive possibility for those of us over 50.Thanks, Lilias, once more for your humor and your humaness!"
3,Jawbreaker Anyone?,"Blueline Medic treads the line between straight up emotional indie rock and your average emotional punk band (what's the distinction? -- who knows these days?), with a intriguing, but albeit, typical debut. From the Blake Schwarzenbach (Jawbreaker and presently Jets to Brazil) vocals to an style of music that moves from a medium to slow rock, Blueline Medic seems content blending in with the crowd, lacking a sense of urgency in their style that works so well for many bands of this genre. The album definitely has its high points, with the song ""Swan Song Swan Dive,"" the singer's vocals manage to sound genuine, and the lyrics coincide with the music beautifully, and moments like these make me eager for a full length to see just what this band can do, but as a whole, the album will probably blend in with the countless other bands emerging from the punk/emo scene. Worth a listen for fans of the aforementioned Jawbreaker."
4,A unique story,"I enjoyed this book a great deal as a child, though the ending always frustrated me greatly (and it will frustrate your children; I guarantee it). The story is clever, though somewhat sad, and offers a nice look at some Jewish-American traditions. Children coming from that background might find the book particularly interesting. Also, children who tend to personify animals might enjoy this book, as the titular carp has a distinct personality. Strict vegetarians might find the book slightly distressing, however."
1,A dissenting voice,"I agree most with the review just previous to mine, although I am all the more unhappy with this book. While the premise is interesting the execution (so to speak)leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps, being charitable, this is because it is dated. Its appeal (being charitable) seems to be in its evocation of nostalgia. However the ending involves a fish (which the children in the story view as a pet) being dispatched by a mother wielding a club on the kitchen table. This does not inspire warm feelings about Passover. My son and I were both upset by the ending. I am not a vegetarian, but this book could well lead me to this."
1,look elsewhere,"This book is a very detailed account of one person's experiences in Subud and his beliefs. It is not however representative of what Subud is. I really do not think this book would be helpful for someone who is new to Subud and wants to find out more. Even for someone who is well aquainted with Subud, I think you'll find this book confusing and incorrect. If you are interested in a very extensive description of one man's experience -- this is perfect for you. If you want to learn about Subud, I'd receommend looking elsewhere."
5,Glimpse of a Master Artist and Her Work,"I was aware of and owned many of the art cards produced by Sue Coleman long before I discovered this delightful book with so many of her images included as well as her descriptions of how she found and painted these beautiful images, complete with her ""native translations"". I feel that she has captured the essence of the Pacific Northwest Native Coastal art as few non-natives possibly could. Her images are delightful and she captures not only the spirit quality of the animals she paints, but also their personalities as in her painting of Steller's Jays where she has a jay represented and scrapping with the spirit picture of the same jay. This is only one example of how Ms. Coleman captures the essence of the animals she paints. Good read and excellent reference book.Dawn Edwards, Kindle Book ReviewWe are not connected with the author, publisher, or Amazon in any way."
1,unplayable,"There are so many glitches on the cd that it is unplayable. I didn't think this could happen with a cd, but here it has. This was a complete waste of money, time, and effort."
2,I'm checking out a different brand next time.,Very slow cutting. Must be brought down very gently or will catch. Tended to loosen in the chuck.
4,Smooth cut.,"The quality of the cut on this bit is excellent. The only flaw, if it can be considered that, is that the maximum cutting depth if this bit is shorter than the one it replaced. I am drilling 45 degree angled holes through one inch oak, and it won't quite go all the way through the wood on the ""trailing"" edge. I had to use other tools to complete the oval hole on the bottom. Trying to re-align the workpiece to finish the hole starting from the original back side would have been nearly impossible."
3,Gilda- Ultra Jersey Knit,"I like the shirt but the color was so bright, the material very good. My husband still use it and like his new outfit"
2,Sherry,Ordered for my husband. He did not care for the fabric at all. It was also too short and tight. One of the few online purchases I made that I returned.
4,Good quality,"I have bought many shirts from Gildan. They are very good quality at reasonable pricing.Happy New Year, and God Bless America"
4,Very good book!,Well thought and displayed information clearly. My knowledge on the univers has truly expanded.
4,"Another ""gem"" from Charles Stanley","Dr Stanley simply and effectively explains the choice to walk in godly wisdom day by day - by making choices based on biblical principles, not by the world's standards, and seeing things from God's perspective. This book was a real help to me and is a ""must have"" for people that enjoy Charles Stanley's teachings."
4,What does DW eat?,"I read ""D.W. the Picky Eater"" and in this story D.W does not like anything with pickles, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, eggplant, pineapple, parsnips, and cauliflower. Her picky eating habits make her miss out on all the fun dinners.Finnally D.W.decides to go out on Grandma thoras birthday and she has to pick out something on the menu.She picked the little bo peep pot pie. D.W. ate it while the whole family watched and drank all her drink. And D.W. said ""Could I have this every night?"" and her mom said ""I'll need the recipe."" I think you should read this if you're a picky eater."
5,Perfect!,"This is a great book for children ages 3-8. The pictures are absoloutely wonderful with a lot of detail and nice color. My seven year old sister makes me read it to her every single night, and doubles over laughing!! A MUST READ!"
4,Someone please do this as an animated film!,"Read this charming little book while spending a lazy afternoon on the beach. ""A Coyote's in the House"" is exactly what you'd expect Elmore Leonard's first children's novel to be- Funny, engaging, and as hip as his best adult books. I loved how Antwan was both lovable and a little dangerous, like all of Leonard's best characters. Picture Chili Palmer as a Hollywood Hills Coyote and you'll be pretty much on the mark.This will make an excellent animated film (take notice, Disney!)- one that, like ""Shrek"", will delight adults as much as kids. One star off for the brief toilet humor, which wasn't necessary...."
4,....................................,"I really liked this book. I don't usually like books with talking animals, but as I read on, I found it's not really about dogs, it could relate to people, us, as well. I liked this book, and hope you like it too."
4,Good Book,"I really liked this book. Of course, there were some things that I didn't agree with, but overall it was good. I love how the author intersperses the advice with ""career confessions"", which are short stories by different businesswomen. The most helpful chapter for me was ""Are you Willing to Accept Help."" It covered everything from accepting criticism, networking (I need a lot of help on this one), and mentoring."
5,For the twenty something woman who wants it all,"Wildly Sophisticated is loaded with questions to challenge you to explore your identity, your dreams, desires, hopes, and fears. The book provides practical advice, inspiring stories, 'Career Confessions' from other women, intimate details about overcoming obstacles, and a 'Strategy' - how to take action on various topics.This book gives practical advice and hands-on tools for young women to find true fulfillment and success in both work and life. It is a refreshing, provocative read that challenges you to find your Quest for Success. This is a great book to use to help you survive your entry into the modern work world."
4,A great update on classic job advice,"""Wildly Sophisticated"" is a modern take on classic themes. The fact of the matter is, Nicole Williams addresses the concerns of the modern career women in an upbeat, empowering way. Every woman with the desire and will to succeed will appreciate this book. It also helped me to understand and confront the issues that affect the modern young woman, such as how to integrate a fufilling work life with a satisfying personal life. All in all, ""Wildly Sophisticated"" is a worthwhile read, especially for any working woman under 40."
5,"Within the word ""Question"" is a beautiful word - quest.","The above quote by Elie Wiesel was one of the first lines I read when I picked up this motivating book. The Quest for career development, and in a larger sense self development, is made easier through Nicole Williams guidance.She not only gives solid advice; she also asks probing questions, sets up revealing exercises, and gives inspiration in the form of quotes and confessions by Wildly Sophisticated women the world over.I personally found this book helpful in making important, and to a certain extent painful, decisions about where my career, and my life, were going. I'm still putting my pieces together but feel more secure, and wildly sophisticated!"
1,Obnoxious,"I started reading this book and only read about a quarter of it before I finally threw it down in disgust. Be different but not too different, you wouldn't want to stand out. Be sexy, but not to sexy, you wouldn't want people to think your sleeping with the boss. It's ok to carry last season's handbag. Honestly this book drove me nuts. It constantly states things and then takes it back. I ended up giving my copy away to a friend who is going into a business career. This book would probably be great for a Cosmopolitan reading, big city girl. I picture a girl like Jessica Simpson loving this book."
3,Moto RAZR V3 holster,"Since I have the extend battery, I had to use one of the face-in holsters. It does what it was supposed to do. Not very sturdy thou. My last one broke off the top part. For a couple of bucks, I will buy it again if this breaks."
1,"Not safe, phone keeps falling out",This looked like the prefect solution being so small and light weight but it turns out it does not hold the phone securely and it has fallen out and I have almost lost it. Stopped using it after the first day I got it.
3,Great liner,"This product is worthless as an eyeshadow in my opinion. It isn't a silky enough formula to blend well. I have to put it over the top of other eyeshadow to get it to blend and fade out. Even then, getting it to fade is rather difficult. The sparkle doesn't come through at all either, just like their beauty marked if you've used that.What I do use this for, all the time, almost daily, is eyeliner. I've almost used up the whole thing. Sometimes I use an angled brush, and sometimes I use a pointed liner brush with a little water. It stays all day and doesn't smudge. Using an angle brush gets a softer black, and using it with water gets a rich black similar to liquid liners. Either way, you will not see any of the glitter still, it's just black.As an eyeshadow, it gets 1 to 2 stars, as a liner, it gets 5 stars."
1,TRACKING NUMBER,"I BOUGHT 2 DAYS AGO THE MAC Eyeshadow ~Black Tied~ Nib AND YOU DIDN'T SEND TO ME MY TRACKING NUMBER YET PLEASE SEND TO ME, BEST REGARDS"
4,The return of Michael Jordan,Prepare yourself for an unexpected journey into the mind of Michael Jordan and discover what leads him back into the NBA after a three-year absence.This is a quick and easy read. I hope the writer delves deeper into the subject in a future book.
3,General History,This info. is just your basic info. regarding early Incas. It discusses their building techniques and defensive approach. It later talks about present day Incas.
5,Inca History,Great DVD with educational information about the history of the Incas of Peru as only The History Channel can deliver. Excellent product.
2,A book written probably to confess being a bad presenter,"I have being looking around for some quick ideas of making an effective presentation. However, this book is organised in chapters without clear descriptions of their content. It is definitely not a book for busy people."
4,Good Info,I found somewhat difficult to read but will continue to work thru the text. This will increase my determination to read the author's thoughts.
4,Brilliant fun if not entirely consistent,"Reading doesn't get much more enjoyable than books 1 and 2 of Gargantua and Pantagruel. Both are wonderfully ludicrous, playfully crass, consistently hilarious and jolly good fun. Of course, there's more to Rabelais than all that but you get the distinct impression that the man himself would rather be entertaining than painstakingly examined - and entertain he most certainly does!For me, book 3 doesn't live up to the first two. I admit to finding it a bit dull! The trademark humour is still there but it's neither as concentrated nor as consistent and that's a shame. Book 4 is excellent once again, although I still feel it doesn't reach the glorious heights (or should that be dirty depths?) of the first two, whilst book 5 is rather bizarre!All in all, Gargantua and Pantagruel is brilliant but I couldn't give it the full 5 stars because of that third book."
2,"Important, but also rather hard to really get into","I know that this was considered an important transition between renaissance literature and the beginnings of what we call the novel, but I found this next to impossible to get into. Rabelais might not have invented toilet humor, but he stretches it out about as far as it can possibly go (which ultimately, isn't that far). The constant references to glands and bodily fluids get old real fast. I suppose that in the 16th century, the fact that people poop, pee, spit, vomit, sneeze, fornicate and fart was cause for endless laughter, and those things can still be funny, just not for 700 pages on end. The whole thing is a colorful and inventive mess, but a mess none the less. If you're looking for something to read from this era, try Don Quixote instead, it's got plenty of toilet humor but actually has good characters and a delirious narrative structure which really puts this bloated thing to shame."
1,Should have spent a little more on the Olympus original.,"I was really debating whether to try this inexpensive battery out. I finally thought, how bad can it be? It's just a battery right? Well, I charged it up and put it in the camera and was able to get one or two shots off. Then the battery continually shuts the camera off. Like it is pulsing or something. I would turn the camera on, it would shut itself off... it was like the battery would run out of charge each time I turned it on. I put the original battery back in and everything works normal. Dumb move on my part to throw the packaging away before fully evaluating. If you want to take a chance, you might get a good one... but keep your packaging just in case!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought two of these batteries in September 2004. One worked a month and went bad. The other one is still working so far (Nov 26, 2004 I think I'll go back to buying the Olympus battery even though it costs more."
1,"Do not buy this battery,Do not buy this battery,Do not buy this battery",Like the other reviewers I had the same problem. This is a complete rip off. The battery less then a year old does not hold or take a charge.
3,Not as good as the real thing,"This was cheaper than the Olympus brand, but stopped working after about a year and a half (would not hold a charge). I bought the Olympus version at a higher price, but it is still working after over two years. You get what you paid for, I guess."
2,Got lucky - it worked for 18 months,Compered to the other reviews I feel like I got lucky with mine. I got about 18 months of equivalent or better battery life compared to my actual Olympus BLM-1. I got around 30-40 charges out of the battery before it would no longer hold a charge. My original Olympus BLM-1 battery is now almost 4 years old and still holds a full charge (around 600 images on an 8080-UZ and over 1000 images on an E-510). I no longer purchase off-brand batteries.
1,Low quality. Does not last,"After about 10 charge cycles in the Olypus charger, it does not even hold a charge anymore. The capacity was never as much as the original Olympus battery and it continually got worse. It did not cost much but still was not worth the price. I definitely do not recommend this battery."
4,Excellent!,"This album is from Ann Beretta's singer. Is it a solo album. It is very similar to the album The Other Side Of The Coin, the acoustic album from Ann Beretta.Althjough it seems extremely similar to the other side of the coin, some songs aren't very nice and melodic. Except the first 2 songs, this albums is not down enough for me.But if you liked The other side of the coin, buy this!!!"
5,One of my new favorites!,Through blind luck I heard a copy of this cd and I liked it so much I had to purchase it. I've been listening to it non-stop ever since (about 2 months). It just doesn't ever get old!
2,"Not very clear, & I lived in Jeddah!","I lived in Jeddah for years, and it is a fact Saudi Arabia is a very odd place to live, without a doubt. However, the story line was more odd, and at points made no sense at all. Very poorly written, coupled with a poor story line."
2,The mystery is ...did the author forget to finish the story?,"While I did find the description of the Saudi lifestyles both interesting and disturbing there was little else in this book to hold on to. The supposed ""mystery"" was never solved or even built up to be any significant part of the story. The overall story could have been written in a magazine article. ""Woman goes to Saudi to be with husband who we never get to know."" ""Neighbors seem odd but we never get to know."" ""Saudi people have strange social customs - particularly regarding women."" ""Air conditioning man dies and the story ends and everybody disappears and we don't know why."" So what was it I missed?"
2,so-so,"I bought this book reccomended by Amazon,and found it to be a letdown.Although it had its moments of paronoia in a foreign land and the reader gets insights into Saudi Arabian customs;its a plodding read particularly when listening to the characters rather boring afternoon teas.The ending is also a disapointment.If only Ms. Mantel would have given Her characters more life followed with more action and thrills,this book would have been a winner."
4,"Funny, creepy; great female protagonist in exotic locale.","This is a briskly entertaining read. It is creepy and funny by turns, with a well-realized female protagonist and an interestingly exotic locale. The plot is intentionally opaque, and this adds to the tension; there may (or may not be) murders, kidnapings, and other skullduggery in and around the heroine's hermetic apartment building, and we may (or may not) find out.The vividness of the place (Saudi Arabia) brought to mind Graham Greene's African novels. (Why are the Brits so good at this?) Mantel's style takes a bit of patience, but it pays off quickly. Highly recommended."
4,A Thinking Woman's Nancy Drew,"A riveting psychological thriller set in Saudi Arabia. As a young woman, the author actually lived inThe Kingdom for 4 years, so knows whereof she speaks. This literary novel lets the reader experience what it’s like for a bright, prickly western woman who finds herself living in such an alien culture. Her powerful writing conveys a sense of place that’s palpable and vivid insights into a society we’re well advised to better understand. This is a compelling and insidiously creepy read, sort of a thinking woman’s Nancy Drew."
4,"A fascinating, frustrating peek into another world","Frances Shore is a youngish British woman most women will relate to easily. She has an innate curiosity that probably serves her well back home--but is a danger in Saudi Arabia. Like Frances, we never do find out what really happens in Jeddah: hence my reluctance to rate this book higher than 7. But it kept my attention to the end, and the insight gained into Saudi culture is well worth the effort."
2,Negative and exaggerated,"I base my opinion on Mantel's novel from 18 years of living in Saudi Arabia. In defence of this book it is obvious she writes from first hand experience of Jeddah and she suceeds in creating an uneasy atmosphere from the start. However, the characters are, without exception, somewhat bland, empty people, lacking strength or depth. This may well be Mantel's intention together with the lack of substantial conclusion to the plot. Mantel dwells entirely on the negatives in Saudi and very little on the positives, such as the genuine friendships one acquires by getting to know people from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures.The success of this novel must surely lie in its negative sensationalism rather than its literary credibility. It would be tragic if readers were put off visiting Saudi Arabia on the strength of this book which portrays bigotry and ignorance."
3,SO SO,"I am at chp. 13-15 and have found mistakes. I have taken and currently work with most of the items taught in this book. I am doing this to get to the DB2 courses. Mistakes aside, this is a great book for beginners."
3,Good Book on Mainframes,"Good reference book, I have it by my desk and use it often.I wish it had some info on FTP, may be next release."
5,This book will answer all of your JCL questions!,"The biggest problems with other JCL textbooks I've used in the past is that they usually don't present a complete set of the available commands and they don't include any meaningful examples. This book is the exception. The layout makes it easy to find the information you're looking for, and best of all, it contains complete examples that help you get a better feel of how the various commands should be used. I'm a consultant with over 15 years of mainframe programming experience and there are still times when I have questions on how to perform a specific task in JCL. I'm going to make sure that I always have this book at arms reach. I'm also in charge of getting new recruits up to speed in the mainframe environment and I can't think of a better book to have them start out with."
3,This is a thinking book.,"This is the 3rd in the sags of Prescot of Antares. It is about a warrior that is in the grip of the Star Lords. And they send him on mission after mission. He goes through mountains, jungles, and fantasic challenges. And has the love of Delia to keep him going. In the hope that some day he will be let lose from the Star Lords.The writing is very good. The story is original. But the book is hard to read. You don't fall in love with the hero. Or any of the other people. So when you come to a point of danger, you really don't care. To understand this book you need to read the first two."
2,Great looking product that my dog won't wear.,"Charlie, our maltese/pomeranian mix is happiest when in the car with his head out the window. I got these googles to protect his eyes from the wind and debris. We've got great pictures of him in the goggles, but they have to be snapped very quickly because he won't keep the goggles on for more than about thirty seconds. I'm not sure if anything can be done about this in terms of product design. But unless your dog is completely docile, this will likely be a wasted purchase."
1,Lenovo webcam,"the new updated driver available online still does not work for vista!!! lenovo gave this webcam away with the purchase of my new laptop because they didn't think they would lose money because they knew it would not work anyway even with the supposed new drivers available online! what a joke! i hate being the ""duped"" consumer. i'm buying a $20 webcam from the local computer store and happily throwing this lenovo piece of XXX in the garbage."
3,Pretty good,"It's a nice size which is great. It does dribble a little bit but I think just when I'm not pouring correctly (fully lifting up). The most annoying thing is actually the lid which is really stuck on there that when I lift it up, I always hurt my hand by hitting it when the lid unsticks. However, this is the second time I've bought this teapot (I ruined the first one) which does show that it was the best I've found."
4,No problem with mine,"I have not experienced any dripping as mentioned by the other reviewers. I am quite happy with mine, so maybe I got one from a different manufactured batch. All I can say is that I like the design and mine works perfectly."
5,My 10 year old son loves this book,I bought this book for Christmas for my 10 year old (4th grade). He will read a chapter and then come find me and read it to me all over again because he thinks it is so funny. He has to read 1/2 hour everyday for school requirements and he will continue to read this book for over an hour. Gets him away from the computer and GameCube games. Hurray.
5,Omar is coming back with more funky soulful groove!!,"Just by name alone and hearing he had a new CD out made me search for this CD on Amazon. I haven't heard one song but knew this man couldn't and wouldn't put out anything wack. Then finally I got it and my feelings were correct......... Omar dropped a gem on'em!!! I'm loving this CD as well as his others. My wife-to-be (joke) Erykah Badu is featured on this CD with a remake of a classic jam ""Be ThankFul"". My favorite tracks are ""Essential"", ""Come On"" and both versions of ""Syleste"". Omar's voice and style should be recognized in the states for his way to put together a soulful CD. Radio has once again missed out on greatness from a kat who doesn't need radio to be great. The entire CD is on point and was a great buy at import price. If you haven't heard any of his previous work, check out: ""Music"", ""This Is Not A Love Song"" , ""There's Nothing Like This"" and ""For Pleasure"" all are amazing CDs.But you do need to get this one!!oNe"
3,Some great moments but too much cheese,"When he's at the top of his game, Omar is amazing. But he needs to do more songs like Syleste and In The Morning, and less typical commercial fluff. The guy is obviously incredibly talented, he can do better than your every day R&B jam. And what's up with that 2-step song? Boo on that."
4,Great cd! ready for something new!,I got this cd as an Import 3 years ago and loved It.I got a chance to here this version and It's the same with the exception of the remixes of the 'be thankful' song.He also replaced mrs badu with mrs stone and while a good version It still makes me wonder why It took so long to get the us version released? I give this cd four stars Instead of five because It Is same cd as the old one with a few changes.I ready and hoping for new material from omar soon.
1,Don't Buy This!,I just received my order today and it was also only 1 bottle instead of the case of 12 32 oz. bottles which I had ordered. This is completely deceptive and dishonest! The item description CLEARLY states a CASE of 12 32 oz. bottle(s).
4,contains needed info,"My book group just finished ""The Help"" (I know that should be underlined but I could not figure out how to do it) by Kathryn Stockett and someone recommended this as a good companion book to understand the reality of race relations. I learned a lot about how the ""South"" thinks, how the ""North"" has it's share of the problem, and how much everything is tied together with fundamentalism. I may be wrong, but having just finished ""The Family"" by Jeff Sharlit I can see the roots of their theology in the southern culture. A very important book for understanding race relations today and why so many people are having a hard timw accepting Obama as our president."
5,"Mysterious, mystical, intellectual, and enjoyable","I read Tongues of Men and Angels months ago, and since I still think about it, I decided to write a review. It's an enjoyable and effortless read, especially because of the mystery and mysticism. It's intellectually stimulating in that it's full of puzzles, lots of little ones plus one big one. But the reason that I still think about the book is because it raises a deep question about the nature of language. It's a question that is reasonable yet appealingly mystical, almost spiritual.The book certainly doesn't require knowledge of linguistics, but linguists will find delightful subleties that others wouldn't notice.I should also add that the book has some scary parts and some racy parts. I found this intriguing; I enjoy a book that gets under my skin a little.I highly recommend the book, especially for anyone who enjoys some intellectual stimulation with their recreational reading."
5,I love this figure!,"this figure is very special.Emily the strange is now a toy that you can have for your own! I got this toy as gift from one of my friends, and I love this very much.Emily has soft long black hair, a very nice cut, and as you know her, she has her short black dress and her black tights and her white maryjanes. She has a red and black stand that has Mystery's face on it, and of course, Mystery is included! Mystery has a white collar with a white star on it, she's very cute. Emily has legs that can move, but her arms can't. She can't move like any other dolls, her legs can't bend and she can't sit down, but I love her anyway. Enjoy your own Emily with you at all times, and have a special friend that you know will always be there.now get strange or get lost!Emily The Strange, the stranger!"
1,DON'T WASTE TIME WATCHING IT!,"If your smart you won't waste your time even watching it, All that needs to be said about this show is Garbage!"
2,"Not totally worthless, but not Lewis's best","I myself didn't like THE GREAT DIVORCE much as a story, nor as a picture of Heaven and Hell (and of purgatory, or at least purgation), nor for its characters though in 150 pages with lots of characters one can't expect much, and what we get is OK for what it is (half a paragraph about Napoleon!)."
5,The Great Divorce,"A book about Heaven and Hell could be awful. But C.S. Lewis's fresh take on the subject is both entertaining and thought provoking. Written in his inimitable style, Lewis imagines a busful of visitors from Hell, on a day trip to Heaven, and relates their reactions and thoughts as they speak with their hosts, who wish them to stay. Not your usual scenario. The book is short and very readable, as C.S. Lewis always is, and although the ending is a bit abrupt, his point (which I will leave you to discover) is clear and the writing lucid. Highly recommended."
5,The Great Divorce,"While I am not a great fan of the doctrine of purgatory, this book is a timeless classic of Christian literature. In a way that one only gradually comprehends, Lewis takes the reader along on his version of an ""after death"" experience, illuminating along the way what the implications of their choices during mortal existence really look like. He accomplishes this by going to the very doorstep of heaven and eavesdropping on conversations between the deceased and residents of heaven, showing that their choices to go in or turn back have already been made. Fascinating and chilling!!"
3,a different view,"A different view of what people go to heaven and which don't. The ""divorce"" is between our actions based on self concerns, and our motivations based on love. But it is handled in strictly story form. The story is interesting, even if you don't get the point. This is an easy read."
3,The Great Divorce,As C.S. Lewis' books go I think that this is not his best book by far. I would recommend reading some of his other works before this because if I had not of known of his amazing writing I would have forever considered him a terrible writer after reading this book.
5,Amazing,"This book is not only an incredibly well written book of fiction, but it is so profound in many of its ideas of heaven and how easy it is to retreat from it for the sake of what is comfortable. Everyone should read this. Everyone."
4,A great book for discussion,"C.S. Lewis weaves a compelling and layered story about the meaning of life, heaven and hell, individual and solitary life and community. He raises foundational questions throughout and begs the reader to consider what is important"
5,One of the best books by Lewis,"The Great Divorce is one of a kind, indeed. Like that of his Screwtape Letters, it is a fantasy book, but based on a real belief in the Truth - Christianity and everything therein. C.S. Lewis definitely wrote a lot on Christianity (his apologetics), but this relatively small book puts those beliefs and convictions into a real story and situation. We are not necessarily expected to believe in the story as the Truth about the afterlife, though it is probably a good guess, but we are to realize that it is very hard to let ourselves go, to let God rip and peel off the black soot from our shoulders. I highly recommend it for anyone either strong or weak in their faith. It is also a great piece of literature for those athiest-postmodern people out there!"
4,A well-written theological fantasy,"""The Great Divorce,"" by C.S. Lewis, tells the story of a bus ride from hell to heaven. The title is a riff on William Blake's ""The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,"" which Lewis cites in his preface.Although Christian theology is briefly cited in the book, it seems that Lewis' overall point--to promote belief in and adoration of a supreme being--is as applicable to Jews, Muslims, and many others as it would be to Christians. To quote the book directly: ""There is but one good; that is God.""The story is full of wonderful visual images and imaginative flourishes that give the book the flavor of classic fantasy literature. And although at times the book has a certain smug quality, it is entertaining and thought-provoking. Lewis' prose style is consistently engaging."
5,What a Ride!,"Even though I like other C.S. Lewis books, I didn't think I'd enjoy his fiction. I preferred facts over fantasy. Then, at the coaxing of a friend, I read this book. While reading the first few chapters I was entertained by his imagination & creativity, but soon my interest soared. The second half of the book captivated me and the inferences to theology amazed me. Before I finished this book I was ready for more of his fantasy works. Upon finishing this book I exclaimed, ""Clive, you're the man!"" ... and yes, I did thank my friend for his encouraging me to read this book."
5,Simply a Masterpiece,"This book will make you:SmileLaughCryPonderLook up words that are hard to understand (Applicable for Non-natives like me)And it leaves you with a feeling of wanting ""More""The story is excellent and his points are all very very powerful. I actually finished this book in 2 days because it was almost impossible to put it down after I had started, and of course it is not a very long book to (146 pages)This book is so awesome that I have and must read it one more time soon so I can get deeper into it. It was not an easy book to understand and I spend some time looking up new words and learning old English expressions which made this book even better.It is the first book ever that I have read by C.S Lewis but have already bought (Screw Tape letters and Mere Christianity).Great book that I want to suggest everyone to read. Any one can benefit from this book.If you are a Christian, Agnostic, Atheist or anything else, this book is great and very very beneficial.Emil"
5,Free will and destiny are reconciled.,"C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors. I read this book expecting great things and Lewis delivered. In the characters I saw something of myself, the human condition and the meaning of Life. The insights in this book range from the trivial to the profound, something for everyone. For example, Lewis explains how Time and Eternity make it possible for us to have both our free will and our destiny. He shows how important we are, yet also how insignificant we can become if we choose not to see our spiritual paths."
2,Interesting read,"Metaphors galore, this book is interesting and a fast read. The kind of book you get cliff notes on to understand the metaphors."
2,Hmmm...,Interesting story but not what I expected wanted more intrigue and mystery oh well lesson learned I'll read the preview next time
4,Excellent book.,"I very much like this book. It is not as good as Screwtape Letters, which is my favorite book of all time. The imagery is well-done and the sense of how people choose hell is thought-provoking. It is important to remember that this is fiction, and that Lewis is not a theologian, so the images should be viewed as just that and nothing more. And Lewis makes some theological errors too (such his belief in a type of Purgatory) and those errors are in clear view in the book. But if you can get past that, there is much to be learned from it. The pivotal passage is in Chapter 9: ""There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'thy will be done'."""
5,Great book,"This is an excellent book! As there are already many good reviews here, I would only add a quote from the book that I like very much:""Earth, I think, will not be found by anyone to be in the end a very distinct place. I think earth, if chosen instead of Heaven, will turn out to have been, all along, only a region in Hell: and earth, if put second to Heaven, to have been from the beginning a part of Heaven itself.""If this is at all true, it sure offers a fine perspective on living!"
5,Thorough and high quality +++++,"Al-Mawrid 2002 was recommended by another reviewer (Jorge X. McKie) when I was looking for a good English-Arabic dictionary. I ordered it sight unseen based on the review (and after browsing the pitiful Oxford offering) and I am impressed. This 1200+ page tome is as complete as I could have wished for. And it has a few addendums that are useful and entertaining: The Lamps of Experience is a collection of English proverbs with origins and Arabic equivalents; English words of Arabic origin; and Biographical Names - this is particularly well-done with many color pictures.The only minor complaint I might make is that the Arabic words do not have the vowels marked so I must make a second trip to my Arabic-English dictionary to ""discover"" the correct vowels. Maybe after my knowledge of the pattern ""rules"" improves this will not be so much of a detraction. Overall, however, this dictionary is an outstanding example of what a bilingual dictionary should strive to be."
5,We LOVE it!!,"I received this crepe maker for Christmas and my husband tried it out. There is a bit of a learning curve involved, you definately have to use the right ingredients, and put pressure on the spreader tool when spreading the crepes. But once we got the right flour (buckwheat flour is necessary for some recipes) we were off and running! We made crepes for dinner, yummy! We made crepes for breakfast! And we made crepes for a house full of family, and everyone loved them. They were quick and easy to make, and definately better than a crepe pan. Turning the crepes was a breeze and filling and folding was so simple and quick. Don't give up after a couple of messed up crepes, and you'll soon be enjoying them all the time. Oh, the ladle is definatley too small, but you can either fill the ladle more than once or buy a bigger ladle which i did for about $2."
2,Photocopied book,"Dear customer,This is just a bad photocopy of the original. Only the covers seem to have been printed with quality. The text sometimes is missing or slightly printed, the paper is just blank sheets. But the worst are pictures. Comparing with the original, I've decided to scan, print and paste most of the photograps to my purchased copy, cause you can barely distinguish the figures on them.However you can read it properly, at least you can do that."
4,Best coasters to use!,"We have plain sandstone coasters and we love them. I liked this design so I purchased a set. The color of the design is lovely. We just got them so I don't know how well the design detail will hold up to ongoing use. If the design holds up I'll change my review to 4 stars.I plan on getting the fleur-de-lis design next.Fleur De Lis Thirstystone Sandstone CoastersSandstone is very absorbent which is key in the summertime when every drink you have is sweating. I've only managed to soak through these once, and that was when I got a big glass of ice water and forgot about it.The cork on the bottom protects your furniture and also acts as a little bit more of an absorptive barrier."
3,coffee cools fast,The flaw with this product is that the coffee cools down very fast. It would be a better design if there was a rubber or rubberized extension on the interior portion of the lid sitting inside the beaker which could be rotated for pouring or for sealing in the heat from the hot coffee (at least for a little longer).
1,MY BEST FRIEND'S WIFE,"A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. THIS VIDEO DOESN'T EVEN RATE A HALF POINT. THE MARRIED CHARACTER, WHO CONSTANTLY SAYS ""DUDE"", IS A MORON. THIS WAS THE WORST ""ACTING"" I'VE EVER SEEN. THE WORST EXCUSE FOR SOFT PORN I'VE EVER SEEN. I ACTUALLY FELL ASLEEP SOON AFTER THE VIDEO STARTED."
1,Bootleg CD--Jesse gets nothing,"I just saw Jesse Winchester in Berkeley, CA on August 7th 2005, and was told that this album is a bootleg--that he gets no royalties for it. He's beginning work on a new project that may be out in 2006 which hopefully will include his ""Shama-lama-ding-dang-dong""...a song worth the wait. Skip this CD, and support the artist!"
3,Shocking Facts,How do we change the Culture of neglecting this kind of abuse against our soldiers ... It is very disturbing and needs to be addressed.
1,LeVena Johnson not mentioned???,"Although this is a gripping documentary, I find it extremely lacking in that it does not include the experience of female service people of color descent, particularly in light of the shocking incident and cover-up involving LaVena Johnson, a female soldier who was raped and then murdered (July 19, 2005) while actively serving in Iraq. To not give any consideration within the documentary to the racial component of this circumstance is as much a re-victimization of female victims of color, as it would be to ignore the circumstance altogether for white female victims. I think it totally reasonable to believe that female victims of color only receive a fraction of the considering that white female victims already DO NOT receive. This lengthy video would seem to have had plenty of opportunity to at least drawn some minor attention to the racial component of this circumstance or at least to make mention of the LeVena Johnson story.[...]"
3,Sexual harassment and abuse in the military,"The movie follows the experiences of several female members of the military and the challenges they faced while serving with sexual harassment, abuse and violence (rape). Despite noble and effective efforts by DoD to raise awareness, educate, prevent and counter these real-life problems, women in uniform still are the subject of male hostility. The film is quite narrow in its context and paints the military services as disinterested and abandoning the aggrieved women to resolve their own trauma. While that may have been the case in the incidents reviewed, it is not always the response to situations. And the film fails to address aggressive female and other inappropriate behaviors, though that does not justify or excuse what men did to these women or others whose stories have not been told as widely. Overall, a helpful insight, though nothing is mentioned about solutions to the problem. It seemed to be another complaint, ""poor me"" session."
4,An important film that should be mandatory viewing,"I'd been hearing with alarm about this ""invisible war"" from veterans' advocates and others who have worked with many of the women (and men) who make up the staggering number who have been sexually assaulted in the course of serving in our military. But this film packs an emotional wallop as it shows in stark relief why we must get a handle on this issue immediately. We owe it to our sisters and brothers whose good faith service to their nation has resulted in the psychic wounds we see onscreen with heartbreaking clarity.(By the way, I gave the film four stars instead of five only because, although it's artful, it is the material, not the filmmaking that most stand out.)"
1,"Appear to be ""factory defects"", January 28, 2010","I also purchased the 6-piece set of 11-inch dinner plates with a 6-piece set of the bowls and all appeared to be ""factory defects"". Needless to say I returned them all to Amazon. Their customer service has been very helpful with my return process-first time I have returned anything to Amazon.If you are considering buying these, think twice. Too many black flaws within glazing, areas are missing color/glazing; color varies from dish to dish. Read my review of the dinner plates."
1,Most came broken,"It's unfortunate that Amazon can't pack breakable items a bit better. They were basically thrown into a box with little padding. The 1st shipment came with 4 of 6 bowls broken. Had to have them send another shipment which fortunately came with 2 of 6 broken. We then sent back the 6 shattered bowls.I'd only say that Amazon should teach their packing people how to pack something that breaks a bit better. I've seen more stuff coming from Amazone that's literally thrown in a box, with some padding pillows on top, with zero thought on if the item will move around, etc. I paid extra for Amazon Prime and I now question what I'm paying for."
5,Sorrento Bowls,"These are great bowls that I use over and over again. They are microwave, oven, and dishwasher safe. They are just the right size for cereal, fruit or ice cream and I love using them."
4,a classic album,"if you are a kool g rap, pete rock, or any old school fan . you would put this up in your classic album selection. you will here lyrics that will blow your mind. beats that are untouchable. you will be playing this album for days"
3,Not exactly the Fab Four...,"but if you've ever wished that someone would unearth a lost album from The Knickerbockers or Billy J. Kramer and The Dakotas, you'll have a lot of fun with this one."
3,A Stranger in the Kingdom,Was hard to understand. Most people would be upset with the graphic nature of this movie. The racial aspect was very demeaning..
1,Just strange would be a better title.,"I was not very fond of this film. I realize the subject matter is serious, but I didn't think it was handled very well. The hillbilly feel was uncomfortable, and the racist characters nauseating. Chicken fights, foul language, and stretch mark pocked dancers really aren't interesting to me. These distractions take away from the story, and make me wish they would have given this film a little more integrity. The scenery is beautiful, and the classic cars are a pleasure to see. I wish I could say the same for the movie."
1,don't purchase,This video almost made me not want to go to Kumba Mela. There was not really any quality narration. It made the event look more like a variety show. Didn't give off a spiritual vibe.
4,Love it....but editing was horrible and too many scenes were cut,"The novela was beautiful something different for a change. I gave it 4 stars because the editing was horrible and I did not like when the other scenes were cut, its like you cannot even tell what is going on exactly. But other than that me encanta. :-)"
1,Better Homes and Garden Diabetic Cookbook,We were very disappointed in this cookbook. The recipes are high in cholesterol and carbohydrates and do not indicate the amount of sugar. A lot of the recipes are high in sodium. We were looking for some good healthy recipes for diabetics. The book seemed to be old and out of date with current information available.
1,Don't Waste Your Time with This Book,"The one 5 star review must be from one of the authors or their friends, because this book is useless. I returned it after the first day."
1,Somebody Is Stealing Your Money!,"Owners of the Australian copyrights to these songs are cashing in on 16 songs that you should obtain on a far better quality disc(s). ""Birth Of Brilliance - 1963-1966"" contains two CD's that completely cover the Gibbs Australian musical heritage. On this set you get 32 songs that are wonderfully remastered! This is also a collector's item."
4,I love this watch but it's NOT very large,"This watch will do everything as described in the description. It is also very easy to program. I just wish they provided specs so am not rating this with 5 stars.The watch face is about 1 3/4 inches wide and 1 3/4 inches tall. Very bulky compared to the women's original indigo ironman watch which I had in the early 90's. My chest size is 40 inches and I set the chest band to the largest size, which just fits me. So .. if your chest is greater than 40 inches, you'll find the heart rate band a little tight.I can't wait to use this in my workouts!"
5,good,"What more can I say, right plug all gaps were correct great product by Bosch works in my Volvo just fine"
1,"metal outside, paper inside?","the other reviewer is overly optimistic if he hopes it will last. bought one last week and loved how well and evenly it watered. on the 2nd day of use (we're talking 1 hour/day), it started ""sticking"", i.e. it would oscillate to one side, and stick there for a while, after a few seconds it would start to move again. by the 3rd use, it wouldn't oscillate at all.so i got a replacement. within 5 minutes it was stuck on one side, not moving at all. when i picked it up to take a look at it, water was pouring out of the bottom (not the hose connection at the back, but literally the bottom of the unit).i got mine at home depot...it was the most expensive unit they sell (outside of the travelling sprinklers). i bought another brand, but if that doesn't work, i'll break down and buy the $50 gardena sprinkler from amazon."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,These sprinklers used to work very well..lasting a couple of seasons. The ones I purchased this year did not work from the start!!!!
1,Do not buy!!!,"I purchased this sprinkler about 4 days ago. Tonight I look out and it is stuck to one side. I played around with it for a while, it would sweep back and forth two or three times than stick again. This is a horrible product!"
3,cut corners,"The cap works fine functionally, no complaints there. the casing was dented (as if the unit had been dropped at the factory), but that was only cosmetic damage and I don't care much about that.The plastic mounting brackets were terrible though. the screws they supplied weren't long enough and I had to poke around on my own to get suitable hardware. I'm using the cap for a stationary application, but as it seems to be aimed at car stereo systems, I thought I'd mention that I wouldn't trust the cheap plastic brackets.my phone call to their service department about the dent and mounting hardware was answered with a ""yeah, don't worry bout the dent and just go find yourself some longer screws"" not terribly helpful or indicative of a willingness to go above and beyond the minimum required of them.but yeah, the cap works."
2,Not very well researched !,"The title incluudes the words""reversing "" and preventingmacular degeneration and headlines ""overcoming visionloss"", but inside says macular degeneration is not reversable.I beg to differ as there is nomention of the benefits of chelation therapy for the eyes. There is much to be said for chelation therapy as a treatment ,as the build-up of deposits behind the macula is one of the most direct causes of macular degeneration. Theonly known way to remove the deposits and clear out the circulatory system at the backof the eye is CHELATION THERAPY. How can one present himself as an ""expert"" withouthaving any mention of ths typeof treatment? To be sure, diet, smoking and lifestyle are important and these are well covered, but in my opinion, the doctor needs to do some more homework."
4,See again!,"I bought this book because it was written by my doctor who happens to be an expert on wet macular degeneration. The book to my knowledge was very well written and covered the subject well. The only challenge I had was that research is forever changing and unfortunately this book has become outdated. The basics have been very helpful. The advancements have been many in ten years. Hopefully, Dr.Eaton will write an update using his vast experience. I attended a seminar in southwest Florida sponsored and directed by Dr. Eaton and his team. There were many renowned speakers in attendance. During this seminar I was able to learn about the newer techniques being used worldwide. The book gave me a good overview of the disease. The more I learned about the disease the less fearful I was. Thank you Dr. Eaton."
3,"Interesting Mystery, Average Story....3.5 Stars","Okay, so I see I am in the minority here with my opinion on this book, but I thought the characters in this one were so superficial.The hero was 100 percent stereotype of a rich and powerful man with really no unique characteristics that made him someone to remember. The heroine was an unrepentant criminal (I had a little trouble getting past that). But the worst for me was that she seemed to have the emotional maturity of an unruly teenager, speaking in one word sentences or cheeky comments at all times. I really struggled to find some redeeming qualities in her. It would have helped had she been a bit sophisticated -I could have romanticized the criminal aspect probably had that been the case, but, alas, it was not.Because I struggled with the two main characters it made it really hard for me to pick this as a winner. I love Suzanne Enoch though. I buy all of her books and will continue to do so. This one just isn't a must read in my opinion."
4,A REAL PLEASURE!,"I've been avoiding Enoch, because I suspected all her books involved delicate and stupid women. Picked this up on the off chance, and was pleasantly suprised. Imagine! A woman who actually participates in the solution of her problems. Wow! What a revolutionary idea. And not just participates, but contributes valuable skills and knowledge. At best, these books usually involve a woman who knows alot about a subject, but a man who knows more (Nora Roberts, sexist extraordinaire, is the foremost example of this). But Enoch lets the female be strong and sexy, and the male be strong and sexy and it all works beautifully.I ran out and bought a couple of her other books. DOWNER! They are just as I thought! I forbid Ms. Enoch to write historicals from now on. Your mission, Ms. Enoch (and you simply MUST accept it!) is to rescue us starving but intelligent romance lovers from the gag inducing banality offered by most writers and publishers."
4,Good but dragged on,"I found the opening of the book intriguing, and I was interested in the characters for a while. But about 2/3's of the way through the book, I became weary of it. It just kept going and going. It is also very hard to get past the fact that the lead male character falls so hard for a thief! If I found a thief in my house, no matter how handsome he was, I would not want to date him. I would say read it as long as it interests you, then skip through the rest. You don't lose anything doing that."
2,Absolutely Delightful,Suzanne Enoch is an absolute wonderful writer. I enjoyed reading Flirting with Danger from the moment I started reading the 1st sentence in chapter 1. I could not put it down. I enjoyed it so much I immediately purchased the next book of Don't Look Down. These are two books that will definitely keep a smile on your face. The only thing I regret is that the authors don't write fast enough. We need more than 1 book a year.
5,Could Not Get Enough,This book was an exceptional read. I usually tend to stick to historical without the occasional modern. This is definitely on my list to read again which almost never happens with modern romance. The characters were believable and not to contrived. Sam's attraction to Rick was visible from first sight and Rick's attraction to Sam was evident from the second break in. Their mutual lust brought them together to solve the crime which played nicely against the romance and was not suddenly pushed to the back.The changes they brought to each others life gave them things they were missing in their own lives which led to slow trust and then love. I love this book and wholeheartedly recommend it.
5,Flirting with Danger,"Such a great book, I now have this in hard copy and on my Kindle - Enjoy the start of Samantha's new life."
4,"Fun, fun, fun!","It's a fast paced, light-hearted, yet surprisingly rich, mystery/romance!!Samantha Jellicoe is one of the best, and most expensive, cat burglars in the world. That is why, when a bomb explodes in the very house she is stealing from, at the very moment she is doing her ""work"", the red flags fly. Keeping the handsome, billionaire owner alive and getting out without getting caught is her first priority, however, it isn't until she discovers her life is in serious trouble later that she is forced to take action.This book is so much fun, one hates to put it down - even for a moment - to get anything else done! If I didn't think the sex aspect was too soon and too much (totally personal, I admit) this would have been a definite 5 star just for sheer entertainment and excitement!"
5,Loved It!!,"Having never read Susanne Enoch before, I don't know how this compares to her other novels, but I do know how it compares to other contempary novels on the market (being an avid reader of this genre) and it ROCKS. This book is fast paced and clever and the characters are interesting and genuinely likable. That is a hard combination to find. I had no idea 'who done it' and there were plenty of small twists in the plot to keep it going. I thought the chemistry betweent the main characters (Sam and Rick) was well evolved and in a word - hot. The sex scenes were sexy and hot without stealing the show. Definately pick this book up if you are interested in a fast, delightful read. I even plan to try one of Ms. Enoch's historical books because I liked this one so well - I hope its as good, although its not my usual type of book."
4,Sexy Suspense,"Flirting With Danger is a fun, sexy, suspensful, modern-day romp which is both different and eerily the same -- fabulous characters and great storytelling -- to Suzanne Enoch's earlier work. The ending caught me by surprise, but made sense once I realized there were more books featuring the same hero and heroine. My personal preference is for stand-alone novels, given my crazy busy life, but Flirting With Danger was a great book and I'm hoping to eventually read the rest in the collection."
4,Fantastic page-turner,"My first Suzanne Enoch read & I am looking forward to others. The story of Sam, a very smart & beautiful cat burglar. She was raised a thief but has the heart of an antique dealer. Her character is very modern and not the typical ""swoon-at-a-handsome-multimillionaire-feet"" type. The book keeps you curios and alert. The story moves from US to London effortlessly and makes me want to read the sequel. An excellent adventure-romance book."
3,Babylon Whores - 'Deggael' (Misanthropy) EP,"An okay EP release from a Finnish death metal band.The vocals are a bit like a cross between Candlemass and Sisters Of Mercy.The music is similar to that of The Entombed.Six tracks with a running time of 30 minutes.Best cuts are ""Somniferum"" and the acoustic droning ""Deggael:A Rat's God"".It's so-so but certainly not worth going ape sh*t over.I need to check out one of their full length discs when I can.Line-up:Ike Vil-vocals,Ewo Meichem-guitar,Jake Babylon-bass(wonder if that's his real name)and Kouta-drums.Enjoy."
4,"""Prelude to Murder"" and ""Dressed to Kill"" are the same movie","""Prelude to Murder"" and ""Dressed to Kill"" are the same movie. Don't be lured into buying both. That is never mentioned on the jacket or in the description."
3,Deceived!!!,"This DVD was advertised as something new. It made it sound like a new movie. Perhaps the colorization was new, but this is simply the movie ""Dressed to Kill"" colorized! I checked my collection for the title ""Prelude to Murder"" and found none. So, I bought this thinking it was another title. If I had known that it was simply ""Dressed to Kill"" colorized, I probably would not have bought it since I already had ""Dressed to Kill.""If you want a colorized version of ""Dressed to Kill"" then buy this. If not, stay away. It's the same Basil Rathbone version as in his collection. Don't be deceived that it is something new!"
4,Play that Tune!,"Prelude to Murder (DRESSED TO KILL) was unfortunately the last of about fourteen Sherlock Holmes films that starred Basil Rathbone as the famous private detective with Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. The story concerns printing plates stolen from the Bank of England and a collection of three nondescript music boxes. What connection do these items have and will this caper cost the famous Holmes his life?The restoration is very well done for a vintage 1946 film. One thing that did bother me was moving the timeline for the Holmes stories from Victorian England to the World War II era. Somehow it did not seem quite right. However, Basil Rathbone is a superb Sherlock although I think Nigel Bruce was more bungling than Dr. Watson should have been portrayed to my way of thinking.Still all in all a fine job of restoration and entertaining. Holmes comes very close to being in a heap of trouble.Bentley/2008Sherlock Holmes - Prelude to Murder (aka Dressed to Kill) (Colorized / Black and White)"
1,sherlock holmes in prelude to murder,"not happy! the title to this movie was changed from an original sherlock holmes movie. In effect, I found myself with the same movie I already owned with two different title names"
2,Colourful characters,"Bought recently PRELUDE TO MURDER was this a working title? But it was under its original title DRESSED TO KILL why was this? Anyway apart from this minor quibble the film is one of the best colorized Sherlock Holmes movies ive seen . Im all for colorizing movies so there ! How about THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES,THE PEARL OF DEATH,THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT,QUATERMASS II , gimme the paints and I will do the job !!!"
2,People's Information Appliance,"Many people have been taliking about usability for years. Eventhough there is nothing new presented in the book, it provides to thecorporate management, about the issues that need to be addressed forproducts.The usability made the biggest difference between Apple's Newton and 3Com's Palm Pilot, even though both are same similar in functionality - Apple's Newton was a failure, while Pilot was very successful. Both the products have the same core technologies - hand held computer with pen computing. Designers of Pilot had figured out the usability and this crossed the barrier to success.END"
1,Suitfeed,"Yeah, right. Edison didn't know what he was doing because he wasn't ""customer centered"" enough to make flat records. All he ever did in his life was invent sound recording, plus four or five other basic technologies and major pieces of several more. And he died a rich man. What a slacker. If he'd been really smart, and emulated Gould, Fisk, and Morgan, he might have been a real *success.*If you're fascinated by suitspeak and willing to embrace mediocrity and corporate B.S., then you'll get a lot out of this book. But if you've been working in the business for ten or twenty years, then Norman's blatherings are going to look like just more pin-stripe, synergy-leveraging suitfeed.And, BTW, the set-top box he touts as a good idea was a failure. Edison failed the same way with his first invention (the vote recorder), but was honest enough with himself to call a failure a failure. Norman fails to."
2,Read the introduction and the appendix,"The book is persuasive in its central argument that today's PC is overgrown, difficult to use, and suffers from its fundamental architecture as a multipurpose device. The point is made adequately in the introduction and first chapter, however, and the rest of the meat of he book just belabors the point, often repeating the same points in the exact same words.The appendix on examples of information appliances is fun, as he finally gets to what he thinks will be the next generation of devices to replace the PC. This is what I was waiting for through the whole book. Unfortunately, this part is the thinnest of all with only a few obvious examples.Also, I sometimes found his arguments about market forces and the business model of the technology industry simplistic, even naive. I found it hard to believe at times that he worked at Apple all those years.Still, I enjoyed skimming it."
4,"Interesting, but not convincing.","An interesting book from somebody who is obviously a very smart guy. I'm willing to follow most of his arguments because he seems like a very smart guy and because his tone is so engaging and compelling. This is the best thing about The Invisible Computer.The weakest points in his book for me, however, is that he tries to an extend a metaphor without proper back-up in the way of solid evidence. At the same time, he still presents his issues as objective. Norman does a better job, in my opinion, when he is talking about design.At least I have to say that it is well-written, and raises some interesting issues about the future of technology."
1,Can't believe this got past the editor. Can't believe this got past the editor!,"I only at chapter 2, but I need to rant. I'll update this review when/if I finish the book. I can't believe they allowed this to be published, the writing is horrible. Chapter 2 could be done in 5 pages, but Norman goes on and on REPEATING the same ideas and sentences. Every 2 pages he goes through the exact same points again, many keywords are reused. It's just a pain to read.I haven't finished reading this book but I needed to take time out to rant. Maybe I'll update this review when I finish reading...this review is longer than it needs to be...due to repetitions...just like this book."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I enjoyed the Psychology of Everyday Things. In this book, it was called Invisible Computer. I would have preferred he cover more about modern tools and why they could not be as useful as they seemed. User Experience was covered and that is one thing many folks here work with. I had to disagree with some of his examples. He stated that in a modern car, you only need a speedometer and a gas gauge. I would sure like to know if my transmission fluid, brake fluid and steering fluid are low. I would also like to know my radiator needs coolant, BEFORE I am on the side of the road with the hood up. I thought at times he was too desparate to state how we don't need as much technology as we have. People will use it if it is there. I didn't miss not having a microwave or a home computer until I got one. Overall, interesting to read, but had a hard time agreeing with much of it."
3,The Case for Information Appliances,"The content strives to support the design of information appliances due to the complexity of the computer coupled with creeping featurism. Human centered design must be used to overcome the increasing complexity.Chapters 7 (Being Analog) and 8 (Why is Everything So Difficult to Use) are reminiscent of Things that Make Us Smart and The Design of Everyday Things also by Norman.Chapters 9 and 10 focus on human centered development by defining it as a process and then describing 'immutable principles' that should apply. Six disciplines of user experience are identified.As I progressed through the book, I had to continually return to the cover and back pages, rereading the title and description to remind myself of what the book is about. Read the two referenced books first!"
2,"Great topic, weak execution","I have greatly enjoyed and valued some of the author's previous work and ordered multiple copies of ""The Invisible Computer"" as soon as I heard about it in order to share with my colleagues. After reading the book twice (I was certain I had missed something the first time) I was disappointed in the quality of the arguments presented and lack of substance. The basic tenet - that computer should be submerged into our environment and serve highly specialized functions - cannot be disputed. I found the discussion of substitutable and non-substitutable items interesting and the most useful portion of the text."
2,"Interesting in some points, yet redundant","Don Norman makes his point early on Chapter two about the current situation of computer technologies and what companies have done and should do about it. His examples are sometimes useful, but he didn't need to write 300 pages to explain something other people have said before and he could have reaffirmed in a long article."
2,Way too long for the central argument,"Donald Norman seems to have taken up a position like that of Eric S. Raymond of Open Source, but in usability. This is a business-argument pitch for information appliances. It draws very heavily in its early chapters from the book ""Inside the Tornado"", I think by Moore.Inside the Tornado was a book adopted as Marketing Bible by my previous employer, an entrepreneurial venture in the digital imaging industry that may yet sink, but not because of the book. Inside the Tornado is right, but if you've absorbed it, you'll be irritated with the first half of this book.For people who read and appreciated his earlier books and are looking for interesting theoretical or experimental stuff on or near the topic of cognitive science will be disappointed. Don't buy this book for that reason.If you have only a weak grasp of information appliances, what they are, and why they're good, you will want to read this book.I wish someone else wrote this book, though."
5,In My Father's Arms,"As a psychotherapist that specializes in treating men with a history of sexual abuse and having been an incest victim my self, I have read a great deal of the literature and books on the subject. This is one of the best at really conveying the pain and impact upon a developing mind and body. A fast but powerful read that anyone who really wants to understand or to see that he was not the only one. I will recommend it highly in all of my workshops on abuse and to my clients that are ready to face their pain. I am grateful that Walter shared his pain and most of all his healing. It will help many."
4,Father's Arms,"Sad, complex, heart felt and above all well written account of abuse, neglect and the journey through it all. It validates the dissociative disorder that accompanies the cognitive dissonance created by sexual abuse. The author is describing his heart breaking, soul fragmenting experience of losing trust and faith at a very early age. Adds to the library of much needed reporting of male sexual abuse."
4,Police Story sequels get better and better,"If you liked Police Story 1 you'll like this one, too. I think the whole Police Story series gets better with each sequel. This one is more consistent than its predecestor--the comedy and drama blend much better. I don't think it is as humorous as 1, but the stunts and fighting are just as excellent. I thought the battle in and around the children's playground was as exciting as anything Chan has ever staged--but that was child's play compared to the final fight in the explosives warehouse! Buy this if you love Jackie Chan!"
4,"More action, less plot","I loved the first police story, but was a little let down with the second. Though the action was amped up, the story was toned down (presumably to allow for more action). Also, it was a little too similar to the first in terms of tone and presentation. There girlfriend who always does silly things, still did silly things, and is still constantly complaining about jackie. Jackie himself still played a nice guy, who has to save the day doing amazing stunts. The film even ends with the same song playing over outakes as was in the first. Overally, it was a entertaining flick, just not that unique. If you liked the first police story, you'll probably be happy. If not, there's nothing to change your mind this time around."
4,Jackie comes back with a great sequal!,Jackie shoots! AND SCORES! highly recommended action flick which takes off right from where the first ended.
4,The forgotten Chan flick?,"One of Chan's better films. It has only 3 fight scenes(restaurant, playground, warehouse) but each is progressively bigger and better than the previous one. I liked the glass-wearing bad guy who keeps trying to kill Chan, but gets beaten up every time he tries. But Maggie Cheung as Jackie's girlfriend was a bit hard to take, and so was the romance subplot. Overall, really good, but not in the best or elite Chan films. But go ahead and get it."
3,Police Story 2,Not a bad Jackie Chan Movie. It has the typical Jackie humor and great stunts which are always entertaining. Grab some Popcorn and start kicking the air! :-)
4,Nice damper.,"This damper does what its suppose too. Ive had mine installed for a month. Easy to wire, to the thermostat and transformer. This is a normally closed damper, when its open for a long period of time it runs pretty hot, which makes me wonder how long it will last. That why I give it 4 stars instead of 5...for now."
2,"Used to be good, last 2 boxes were not...","I purchased 2 boxes a couple years ago and they were great. Really tough. Zero gloves ripped under normal use, even after sitting in the box for a year. I would show them off to other people by sticking a slotted screwdriver in them and stretching out the glove which would not rip! Amazing! So I bought more. What a difference! 10% to 20% of the new gloves tear either when putting them on(!) or in light normal use. One box I have at hand right now is Lot # 52010690210-L1. I often use toluene, industrial epoxies and other strong adhesives I really don't want on my skin (these also require wearing a respirator), so it matters to me that these fail so easily and so often. Maybe this is just a lapse in quality control? Both boxes have 10-20% failures. I am switching to another brand: trying Cobalt this time."
4,Good blades....long lasting,"These are good blades that last a long time.The reason I dropped the rating to 4 stars is because when the local sharpening shop ground them the first time, some stress was relieved, and the blades became crooked, and had to be re-ground."
1,A Primer on Compromise,"Mr Crook, ironic name, has written a ""Christian"" ethics book that dismisses what the Christian Bible teaches. How can this be so?He bases some of his premises on new scientific evidence, yet doesn't cite any! Why? Because there is no valid scientific evidence that supports his beliefs. He does however, relate his own un-scientic, un-documented findings! Is this a textbook with facts? Absolutely not! It is one mans opinion, based on his liberal theology and secularism. It's going in the trash!"
3,An Introduction to Christian Ethics,"The book was not in great condition. I expected it to be in better condition for the price. If I didn't need it for a course, I would have sent it back."
3,An Introduction to Christian Ethics Fifth Edition,I was required to have this book for a class text. I don't necessarily care for the way it was written.
5,Sturdy,I bought this for my mother so that she could use it for her older pet. The bowls are lightweight & easy to refill & clean. The legs are adjustable to your pet's height- she likes it. Her pet has hip problems- so this product really takes the strain off of her during eating/drinking- I would buy again.
2,Works Only OK,"This heat trap works only OK. I installed them on my 45 gallon hot water tank, hoping to reduce the heat loss through the pipes. But after I install them, the pipes above the trap still feel hot to the touch. This type of heat trap has a plastic flapper inside, with clearance all around it. So it doesn't really seat completely. The flapper moves in both directions depending the direction of water flow. But nothing really forces the flapper back to closed position when the water stops flowing, not gravity (it weighs nothing), no spring. It can just hang open. It's not the best choice for traping the heat. If I need heat traps again I would buy the ball-type heat trap instead."
2,A disappointment,"This is a emotional book about dead and dying loved ones. And in the beginning it evokes strong feeling. But ultimately it is just ""same old, same old."" Young wives die in the sea, and their husbands live out their lives alone, tending a lighthouse. The dialogue often seems artificial. And the author is careless with details. For instance, the French do not make bourbon; it's an American drink in spite of its French-sounding name; and the P-38 aircraft was a Lightning, not a Mustang. Which makes me wonder what else he got wrong. This book started well, but in the end, it was a disappointment."
1,Sacharine and syrupy,"This book is insipid at best, an uninformed offering of vague snippets of history and regional culture. The characters are two-dimensional at best. Mr. Pratt's narrative reminds me of melodramatic juvenile dreams filled with self-aggrandizement, fairy-tale like glory, stereotypical heroism, and plenty of death and dying to wring out every drop of emotion possible. I also found myself very distracted by certain descriptions. Mr. Pratt repeated the ineffective adjective ""manly"" three times in describing his protagonist's demeanor, appearance, or actions. I couldn't help but wonder what the author intended to drive into readers' minds, or if some fear-of-seeming-effeminate motivated the repetition of such a poor word choice."
1,Terrible,"Sappy, predictable and boring. One of the worst books I have read in a while. It reminded me of what my teenage niece use to say: ""Gag me with a spoon"". I had to force myself to finish it and I am sorry I bothered."
5,Reading the Light,"Dear Mr. Pratt,It has not been that long ago that I read your wonderful book ""The Lighthouse Keeper"". This book ranged in emotions so greatly that it kept me captivated. I laughed, i cried, i got angry. It was all around a wonderful book to read. I am a very giving person when it comes to sharing great works of literature. Your book is making it rounds as we speak. I'm not really sure who has it at this moment. Whoever it is, I'm sure they will enjoy it as thouroughly as I did. I applaud you on a job well done. I look forward to your next book.Sincerly A Devoted Fan,Amy J. Brown"
3,"Sweet, but slow","This was my first book I have read by James Michael Pratt, and it was pretty good. It was kind of slow at the beginning, it really didn't get interesting until chapter 24. The rest of the book was good though. Some parts I got kind of lost wondering where he was, but the obstacles that the family has to overcome made the book worthwhile. It's a different book to read, but it's worth reading."
5,Percussionary geniuses,"Great vid! Good advice on working together with a percussionist in a variety of styles. They give examples, and then play a song in that style. Awesome stuff, and the band members( bassist and keyboardist) are kicking serious butt too!"
1,Needs a better container.,I took this kit on a seven day kayak trip. The contents were wet after the second day. The container was similar to a ziplock bag but it wouldn't stay closed - too small. Very disappointed. Just glad I didn't need any of the contents.
2,hmm i did not see an hr,"yes it is free, but i thought it was more than a clip. i played it and i just saw a clip. one -i could hardly hear it and 2-completely did not understand why they were just filming folk playing football, no jokes or anything. maybe i did something wrong. but i deleted it of my kindle because it was wasting memory in my opinion."
2,Turgid,"Rheingold is very bright and full of profound insight. He is abysmal at communicating those ideas. This book is so heavily referenced that reading it is a torment and a slog.He is certainly right. Wireless, wearable computers will create a world very different than the one we have known. Privacy is disappearing. Anyone-to-anyone communication is already changing our world view and according to the research he cites ad nauseum, young folks growing up in this Webbed world are changing fastest of all.Rheingold would have immensely profited from the expertise of a thoughtful editor."
3,This biography was enjoyable.,"This depiction of Moses was not particularly compelling for me. There were so many biblical events that were omitted. Emphasis seemed to be placed on things other than the big issues in his life. Liberty with the script made me look to the scriptures and see if I really misunderstood who Moses was and what he was like. The video depiction of certain scenes did draw me into the history, particularly when his mother put him onto the river. I felt her anxiety as she saw the basket drift out of her sight. This is no where as majestic as his character portrayal in the Ten Commandments, but still an enjoyable and reasonably accurate description of the prophet."
4,"NIce, but smaller than you think","I've purchased the smaller square dishes and loved them, so I thought I'd get the larger rectangle one. Very nice indeed, but it was smaller than I had in mind. The measurements are correct in the description, but in my head I was picturing it larger. LOL I love using these for apple tarts."
4,"Eerie, brilliant, haunting","Feels like entering another time and space with this family and a very special tarot deck of magical powers. It's slow, but worthwhile."
2,a dragging dance,"I was ever so excited. My love, Tarot, was about to meet my other love, reading novels, and dance together to the sounds of life going by...But it was a boring dance; the musician did not perform well. The sentences towards the end of the book seemed to repeat each other over and over and the ending was quite unsatisfactory though a predictable and wished-for one. I dragged myself to the end of the book, to the end of the snow fall just to make sure I was not missing something.... oh no, I was not!I am looking forward to find a GREAT Tarot+novel book!Victoria Evangelina Belyavskaya"
4,Not A Classic?,"So glad I discovered this. Not sure where D. Leigh Blood has been hidingfrom the public eye or ear.Reminiscent of Chamber Strings, Matt Suggs, Fiona Apple, liam Singer. Also mix in a little Incredible String band.Very atmospheric and soothing.The first two tracks are a little faster and this is re-visited a little but mostly a slower elegant kind of listen.Walk through the gates with the baggage we carry around and get your own copy of Swan Girth.It doesn't hurt that he apparently has a love for cats.Just ordered his other Cd called This is'nt Goodbye."
3,Perhaps I bought the wrong color,"Have this in white..not as tight,as i'd like..but if you pair it with let's say..a school girl skirt and thigh high boots, it does the trick..this is not discreetly crotchless..the back is almost completely exposed..which is not bad..but the picture doesn't show this. Not a bad purchase, still a nice outfit to have..just in case"
4,Bulb is actually T8,"I have used Hagen Power-Glo tubes for years and they are fantastic.I ordered two of these and they arrived in excellent condition from One Way Pet, LLC, well packaged to survive the trip.Unfortunately, as with another reviewer, I received T8 tubes, instead of the T10 tubes described on Amazon. Although they are the same length (48""), the smaller diameter T8 tubes require more starting power, and thus were incompatible with my lamps that were built for T10 or T12 tubes.Amazon processed the return with no hassles."
5,Convenience to the max.,It's great to have a good quality laser printer that you can put anywhere in the house and have all your computers connect to it wirelessly. Setup was pretty straightforward both for our 2 macs and our 3 pcs. We love it.
2,very boring,This has to be the worst book I've ever read. It's only somewhat interesting at times but the majority of the book is him rambling on. I can't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 40.
1,It exploded,"I've had my Air Core set for quite a while and liked it very much HOWEVER today as I began to heat it, it exploded. The two parts separated and flew in opposite direction. I was hit in the head, the burners were pushed apart and the lights over the stove were wrecked. Luckily, and I do mean luckily, I was not badly injured. Neeless to say, I threw all three pans out."
1,The horror...the horror...,"I don't care what the rating above says, this movie is like minus 2642346745734454734645546458578 to the 3764784565856575765 power stars.This movie HURT me. (...) said 'every second of this movie is like having a root canal performed on your genitals with rusty dental tools that are also on fire...for the record that's bad.' This description doesn't even begin to capture the mind shattering trauma that will be inflicted upon you by this 'film.'It's not even mock-able or enjoyable on an ironic level. Even with alcohol in your system it's not. A part of me is gone now and it will never return.On the upside every single other thing that ever happens to you in life after this movie from getting herpes to being paralyzed in a freak whacker accident will be that much easier to deal with."
3,WHY DON'T YOU CLEAR THE GARBAGE FROM THIS SEQUENCE,so we can learn more about one of the lovely Glynis Johns' all too rare appearances on film?
1,And there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth,"This movie includes a scientist who randomly decides he wants to be a clown, a talking monkey, and an angry nun. It also contains a fine example of an african tribal jury and instructions on how not to fly a helicopter (by example).In other words, this movie is wonderful if you want to torture yourself and your fellow viewers. I recommend it only if you are able to selectively supress memories."
1,Small and Lacking,The waffles were not very good at all. They were small and dry. They looked like a Belgian waffle but that is as far as it goes. We have come back from Brussels with waffles purchased from the grocery store. These were not even close. Bottom line... don't waste your money...an Ego maybe better.
1,where is my book????,"I never got this book ""Ready to Write More"" ,have anyone can answer me why I have booked this book for one month but I never got it now??? And someone can tell me how do I do."
4,Talented kid!,"I had heard of Jamie Cullum, but not seen him until the Johnny Mercer special on TCM. Like what I saw and heard, so ordered this album. And I like it very much. Interesting performer, and I like that he sings so many of the standards -- like Johnny Mercer!I look forward to more."
2,Not great for my daughters attention span.,When I opened this and popped it in the computer I was pretty disappointed. I didn't realize it when I bought it but it is NOT an Animated Storybook. The still pictures hardly keep my daughters attention. Kid's like things that move and this storybook has minimal movement. The other disappointment was that it is narrated by one person instead of the original character voices. These things have meant that mine will be sitting and collecting dust. It was a complete waste of my money.
3,The Kindle version is horrible,"The Kindle version is horrible. I mean, Milton's Paradise Regained is supposed to be an amazing work of literature and not formatted poorly. It's supposed to be a poem, which means there's supposed to be line breaks. Instead, this version is more of a run-on sentence. There's also no footnotes, which would probably make this useless for anything academic related.If you're looking for Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained for the Kindle, spend a dollar and getHarvard Classics, Vol. 04: The Complete Poems of John Milton Written in Englishinstead."
2,Paradise Lost is much better,"Paradise Lost is my favorite Christian literature of all time, in my opinion even surpassing the Authorized King James Version of the Holy Bible in its poetics. Paradise Lost is also one of my favorite poems of all times. Unfortunately, this poem was nowhere near as good as its prequel. On the plus side, there were a handful of good lines here, but over all not the strength and beauty of Paradise Lost. Which is unfortunate, from a Christian point of view. Paradise Lost concerns the fall of grace of mankind, while Paradise Regained is mostly about the temptation of Jesus by Satan in the desert. One would hope the poem focusing on Jesus would be better than the one focusing mostly upon Satan, but not so in this case. Ah, well."
3,Text but nothing else,"This edition contains the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text of these Milton masterworks. I would have liked at least the inclusion of line numbers in a printing of an epic poem containing more than 10,000 lines, if not a little introduction. The poem is wonderful, but a little more background for today's reader would have been useful."
1,Not for Kindle,"The work itself is of course brilliant- the Kindle edition is abominable. I selected this edition above other Kindle editions for the footnotes. Not only are the footnotes not included in the Kindle edition, there is also not a table of contents. As I am in the midst of book IV in my paper copy and was purchasing the Kindle edition as backup while traveling, this is unfortunate. I do not care to leaf through over 100 pages looking for my place. Poor form, Amazon, poor form."
1,"Erudite, but hardly readable.","It is not clear as to what audience Ms.Slade was addressing in writimg her study of St. Teresa of Avila, certainly not the general reader looking for insights into the personality and life of Teresa de Jesus. Readability apparently was not a prerequisite. The text is hardly free flowing, most of the writing indeed is quite tortuous. Perhaps the volume can be appreciated by an exegete."
5,A good representation,"It's hard to decide which of Kosinski's vignette-based novels is the best, since they're all fairly similiar, and passages are interchangeable. There are slight varitations in theme - the protagonist of The Painted Bird is a child, and in Blind Date you have an investor, while in The Devil Tree you have a wealthy young man, but on the whole each one is as good as another. Considering it, though, I think that Cockpit is the best overall, with some of the most interesting vignettes and the most consistently good writing, and one of the stronger protagonists. It's also the only Kosinski book which I can really say shocked me - usually, I'm prepared for the horrible things which his characters do to each other, remembering that it is Kosinski even when things seem to be going well, but there's an episode in Cockpit involving the elderly which took me by surprise. I reccomend this as an introduction to Kosinski's work, or, if you only read one, make it this."
4,Kosinski continues his mastery of the vignette novel.,"Kosinski's portrait of an ex CIA agent with a knack for controlling others is disturbing, diabolical, and ultimately entertaining. Tarden is both socially and sexually disfunctional, yet somehow we can all identify with him. Kosinski creates an obsessive depressive character with Gatsby-esque personal drive. Well worth the read."
2,OK,"Place a razor blade in your mouth and hold it there for a few hours. Shift it around carefully, mindful of its cool threat to your tender flesh. This is the experience of reading ""Cockpit,"" which tempts and seduces, but ultimately mangles your sense of peace. Much like his earlier ""Steps,"" the book turns on what the desperate (or the simply sick) resort to when there is little to lose. Although I became sick to my stomach at some of the violence portrayed here, the book is worthwhile - even quite interesting - at times. Not for the faint of heart."
1,And what we have here...,"Oh lord. Simple Plan. And this is one of the reasons why punk rock music is dead. It's people like Simple Plan and Good Charlotte calling themselves punk rock. So teen america today is brainwashed into thinking, ""yes...that is punk rock."" They are a boy band. They are just...a more advanced boy band. They can acually play insterments. I mean they are all pretty boys...like in a boy band...and they sing about beening heartbroken...like in boy bands. They just dress differently to appeal to a new group of teenagers. But hey, I guess the people that want to like this stuff..they like it. I'm not gonna say what you can and can't like. Just trying to expose the truth."
1,"Shallow, boring, predictable music for twelve year olds.","Simple Plan is precisely what's wrong with music today. This industry created stuff sounds like the male version of Avril Lavigne for chrissakes! No substance whatsoever. Just whiney, angst-ridden garbage for pimply white-trash adolescents who have absolutely NO clue as to what good rock is. If you want REAL punk rock, go listen to your parents albums and CD's from the late 70's and early 80's. That was when punk had real cojones and attitude! Nuff said."
1,Simple plan blows goats,this band isnt either worthy of 1 star i think 1 star over rates this band people call rock/punk this band is gay thats what they are
2,THE HUNKY NEWCOMER!!!!!,"I give this two stars because the song ""Welcome to my Life"" is used in Conan O'Brien's ""Hunky Newcomer"" bit, so every time I hear that song, I'm reminded of that, and I laugh my ass off. So at least I get some level of enjoyment out of it. Thank you Conan, you are awesome."
5,even better than the first one!!!,"simple plan is my favorite band and i love their music soooooo much. i think that this album is great, even better than the first. their style has changed a bit from hard core to more of a meaningfull batch of songs. of course simple plan's still the same great guys that they've always been, it's just gettin' better and better. simple plan rocks!!!!"
5,"""Still Not Getting Any"" by Simple Plan",I advise you all to get the album if you haven't already. It's the best album ever. I CRIED!!! :p It's even better than the first one. What do you expect huh? The guys spent more time on this album. Hard work does pay off. These guys are the best and they rock my world. GO GET THE #1 album of the year!
1,SP is awesome!!,"Simple Plan's new CD is an awesome cd. It blends their personalities, writing ablilites, and musical talent to come up with an amazing secound album that tops their first!"
1,Worst Band Ever,"If you like Simple Plan then I feel sorry for you. They are tied with Good Charlote for worst band ever. Go listen to some good music like Pink Floyd, Metallica, Chilly Peppers, and GNR.Anything is better than this garbage. This is not rock music it is pop garbage."
1,Just when you thought music could get any worse...,"This album is probably the worst album I have ever heard. First time I heard any of the whiny pop ballads on tv, I almost puked on the carpet in front of me. Of course Ive tried to find someway to like these songs but all of them are horrid. Simple Plan is just a bunch of whiny idiots who whine about how they werent popular in highschool. OH BO HOO, do you realize that there are people living in other countries who are starving being mutilated etc.. or are faced with many other horrible and depressing situations? Oh no lets all cry for your woes BOO HOO HOO. Not only is this cd filled with annoying moans from this pussy and lame singer who claims hes punk but the guitar work is horrible. All there is, is unoriginal powerchords and thats it, no solos, no unique riffs.I could just go on about how bad of a band simple plan is but I have to go on my vacation, cheers"
1,A bunch of whiny medicore emo twits,"i tried listing to this REALLY I tried! I dont know why some people enjoy it, thats beyond me. People love labeling things, such as this band is a emo band nothing more and nothing less, these guys can not perform punk music even they went back in time and toured with THE CLASH for several years. Its just not in them and they have absolutely no potential to even transition themselves from a whiny emo band to a hardcore punk band, SO TO ALL OF YOU PEOPLE WHO THINK SIMPLE PLAN CAN DO PUNK, THEY CAN NOT and also niether can GOOD CHARLOTE or Yellow card. Also whats the difference between these guys and good charlote NOTHING AND I MEAN NOTHING"
1,Still Not Getting Any... And I Can See Why,"These guys are N Synch with crappy haircuts. Bland, simple and uninventive. Crappy hair bands like Poison are musically more talented than these clowns. Do yourself a favor and look for bands that are not played on MTV."
4,Simple Plan's Sophmore Release,"Simple Plan's sophmore album, Still Not Getting Any is phenominal. This album shows a much deeper side of Simple Plan compared to their first album. Their first album was fun and crazy and just...them. I was hoping for the second album to be somewhat like the first. When I listened to SNGA I was leary if I liked it or not. Then I realized that it is still the great Simple Plan we know and love. On the new album the songs are much deeper. This album is great in so many ways, and the dvd is awesome too! Two for the price of one, who can beat that? I would definately reccomend Still Not Getting Any to everyone because even though it is different from the first album, it is still 100% Simple Plan and 100% great music!"
5,"SNGA is the best cd you could get this year, if not ever!","If you're not an SP fan already..after listening to this you will be!! Ever song on the CD is amazing, if I had to choose a favorite I'd explode. So if you're in doubt, just buy it, I promise you won't be disappointed!"
5,Great,"This is a great CD. I totally recommend it to any sp fan. Their new cd is edgier but still very simple plan. My fave song is ""me against the world"" very good song and ""untitled"" is awesome! go buy this cd!"
5,Impressed!,"I love this cd so much, as a matter of fact I'm listening to it right now. The DVD is great also, some funny stuff on there! They have improved so much since the last album, everyone needs this one!"
3,Good CD...but it sounds like their first.,"Aw, Simple Plan. A very great band indeed. But, I would have thought their new cd would sound completely different from the first and I was wrong. They sound exactly the same! It's basically, to me, a total waste. I love Simple Plan and I always have but for christs sake you'd think that they'd sound a LITTLE different."
1,I think my dog could write better songs than these.,"Simple Plan, I've noticed, is actually popular with kids from 5-8. After listening to their songs, it just makes me want to scream, ""Quit whining!"" (i probably spelled that wrong. woops). They seem to think that the world revolves around them and their stupid little teenage problems. I would much rather listen to something interesting like Green Day. The lyrics are all about pointless things. Take, for instance, Welcome To My Life. What good song have you ever heard that is about being unpopular in high school? Every teenager goes through their own problems, and it's fine to write about those. But this song is just so obnoxious and sounds like it's coming from a spoiled 5 year old kindergartener. Besides being whiny, annoying and pointless, they are a bunch of posers."
1,Worst...band.....ever..,"This along with hoobastank is the worst ever album, by the worst ever band....How anyone can like this sh*t is beyond me!Every single song is about some guy having a whine about how he hates his life.....the songs are written from the perspective of an 11 year old....but alas!! the average age of the band members is 25! HAHAHHAPATHETIC...if i could rate this a negative number .. id give it -100"
2,The Tradesman battle away,"Simple Plan are rock's true tradesman. Very little talent but through sheer hard work they have become a renowned band. All the people who flame them have to understand these guys are just trying to carve a career like you or me and guess what? they are suceeding. The fact that I'd rather eat glass than listen to it is not the point, because of their approach they will constantly improve as musicians and songwriters. For now though appreciate this album for what it is a fun album by young, uncomprising males who refused to give ground and are now reaping the benefits. Another thing I don't recommend this long Player to those who look for virtuoso singing, you are better of elsewhere. Thanks for your time."
4,Great Album,"I loved this second album from Simple Plan. I definitely think that the band is maturing, and that just makes me like them more.I hate when a band puts out a second album that is just a big disappointment, but this wasn't that.My favorite song is Untitled which is about someone who drives drunk and gets into an accident and ends up killing the other driver. I didn't know what it was about at first, but it really touched me. If you like them, you should check out the video on their website.Other songs that I liked on this cd were Jump, Shut Up!, Perfect World, Promise, Welcome to My Life, and Me Against the World.Perfect World seems to have multiple meanings and that made me like it more.Me Against the World and Welcome to My Life both talk about struggles and I could identify with them.The rest of the songs are just fun.Thanks for a great album Simple Plan."
2,s'ok,"ok, honestly, ""welcome to my life"" has got to be the CRAPPIEST SONG EVER!!! pierre's voice is 100% WHINEY and it's just HORRIBLE. however, a much better song would be ""shut up"" which is fun and not so disgusting. the only problem i have is, simple plan better get some new topics to sing about. i mean, all their songs are basically, ""my life sucks, nobody understands me"" i mean, it gets old."
1,to the reviewer making fun of anberlin and to sp.. YOU SUCK,"that reviewer is stupid along with simple plan. this is crap that was made for the trash can. if you want good punk, indie turn to ANBERLIN, mae, copeland, senses fail, the academy is.. and armor for sleep."
1,simple plan please do shut up,i realy hate bands that get more than they desereve id love to beat the crap out of these rich bad boy wannabeis. try to sound original like a band that deserves credit ANBERLIN!!!
1,This Isn't Even About Punk Anymore,"Simple Plan was always a guilty pleasure. I never considered these guys even remotely punk, but they had some catchy songs about girls. (maybe I was just in a vunerable state)I respect (and hope) that they are making this for kids, but these lyrics are so lame. Honestly, if Bon Jovi had a kid and manufactured his ""edge"" then he would have this cd. Avoid."
5,Simple Plan Is up in my favorite list,"Yo the first 3 cds simple plan made they were alsome and they were in my favorite but after this cd its has upgraded in my favorite bands. If the songs Shut Up, Welcome to My Life, Untitled, and jump werent on this cd it would b like the others. But still its a alsome cd. There not tht every popular. If u didnt listin 2 this cd yet go and listin 2 it. Its a ever good cd"
3,Worth it just for the song Untitled,I got this Album just for the song Untitled and I would say it is worth it just for that song.This kind of music I rearly ever listen too but I really like that one song.
5,Amazing,"Now, I don't buy CDs that often because, as a ""growing older"" teen, I have other things to spend my money on (car, gas, college...ect.) But I had some cash from Christmas so I decided to buy this CD...and I was completely blown away! This is an amazing CD! This basically targets any teenager...and most of the lyrics relate to any problem that we go through. I listened to it with my Mother who hates the music that I listen to, and even she was impressed. The music is clean and the lyrics are meaningful. This is buy far one of the best purchases I have ever made. So if you are a potential customer reading this and other reviews, don't listen to the people dissing this CD and the music because, if you are into this kind of music, you will have the CD on repeat for the next month....I promise you that."
4,didn't suffer sophomore slumps,"""Still Not Getting Any"" is in my opinion 1000x better than ""No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls"" because Simple plan's starting to varie in their songs. Instead of just singing about girls and relationships and being mad at Dad. I also got really tired of the 1st cd because of Pierre's voice. Surprisingly, it's not nearly as annoying now. proly cuz hes growing up and stuff. Their first single ""Welcome To My Life"" isn't the best song on the album, its OK song, but i dont know why thye chose it as their first single. It doesnt even ryme, but whatever, The cd's AWESOME go get it NOW"
1,God Help Us.,"If this is what receives 5 stars with hundreds of reviews, while excellent, talented bands go unnoticed, then the end is coming and all that is left will be middle school, pink punk horse crap. Once again Simple Plan has put out a wonderful album with music about as punk as New Kids on the Block. With lyrics even more 'simple' minded than the last CD, Simple Plan has seriously passed my expectations... They're even worse now. Maybe I'm being too harsh. I'm sorry, SP fans. Wait, no I'm not."
1,As bad as bad gets,"This is quite possibly the worst schlock passing itself off as emo I've ever heard. This isn't emo, this isn't punk, this isn't even rock music. This is what you get when you give the Backstreet Boys electric guitars and distortion pedals. This makes posuers like Green Day look like Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate or Sex Pistols. And trust me kids. That's saying A LOT."
5,Got into rock,"If it wasn't for this band and album I wouldn't have get into rock music. Plus I was a teenager when Simple Plan released this album which motivate teenagers when they are having troubles like dealing with society, rejections, family drama, and etc. It been many years and every time I listen to their songs it remind me of when I was a teenager. Also old memories of when I was in high school. I still consider this album awesome."
4,"Fun, just plain fun","First I ought to mention that I am not the target audience. I bought this for one of my kids. But when loading it to iTunes, I listened to it and it has a lot of fun tunes about how phony the world is and how girl friends can be uncaring. The same stuff that has been fueling pop music for as long as I can remember, but this is definiately listenable. I heard some of the pieces on Youtube, check that out.My only concern is a technical one. The disk is a ""dual disk"", it has a CD on one side and a DVD on the other. It is a bit thicker (roughly 2X) than standard because of that. It took two discs to find one that my computer's CD drive could read, and even then my computer's DVD/CD drive (which almost always works) could not read the CD side. It would read the DVD side OK. The symptoms of the problem were that the time to read the CD were somewhat longer than the length of the song was supposed to be, and the stored music had static."
5,Awesome,this is by far the best cd i have listened to in a very long time. this album is so good and all the songs have a strong message. i think simple plan did an awesome job of writing these songs and coming up with the different songs. i love every single song on this cd.
1,I'm sorry I'm such a whiney brat!!!,"All Simple Plan does is complain. I mean think about there biggest hits. ""Im sorry I can't be perfect"" I mean come on. I honestly can't stand Simple Plan, so I can't say whether this is one of their best or not, but its awful either way. Don't buy this no matter what, unless you want to be depressed and annoyed by the lead singers whine."
1,this band sucks!,"I have only heard one song of this band on the radio. I havent listen to this album and i dont plan on listening to it. I am not a big fan of emo rock. So why am I reviewing this album. I just want to express my disgusts for this type of music, this band in particullar. I also hate good charlotte and yellow card. I think emo rock sucks. WHOS WITH ME ON THISPS: Amazon should really come up with a no star reviewing option because I really dont want to give this album one star."
1,"This is not good charlotte, folk!","Wow, i only like one song from this album, and that ""welcome to my life"". Just think of this, i save some money to get a couple of cd, and decided to pick this one up, and what a surprise, this album stink.yes, it notting like good charlotte. I thought it would be an perfect album like the young and the hopeless but as it turn out, it notting like good charlotte. Should have got good charlotte debut cd or maybe even a tribute to good charlotteyes, i do believe these guy have talent, however they have kiddy like song and a few bad lyric. However welcome to my life is in my top 50 best song of all time.The bottom line is not to get this, if you were to get this for just one, two, or maybe three song, i highly recommended you to download it online. And, if you can't download, tell your friend to download it for you, and trust me, you will be better not buying this album."
1,Hmmm...,Yeah so this album...Well that's pretty much all the time I'll spend contemplating the value of it.
4,Stop Hating!!,Alrite. I don't even like rock music i'm a massive rap fan but my girlfriend likes all dat rock stuff n she plays dis all the time n it's okay. You got peeps dat love this album n peeps dat hate. Some of u think coz u like music dat shouts like Marylin Manson or whatever that this ain't good n that it's good to hate on them. This is an ok album and coming from someone who hates rock that's a compliment!! Worth buyin for sure.
3,Once again the cliche rides on,"I havn't expected much from this band cause it started out as ''reset'' and then one of the members left cause of the direction they were going in . Well , to call this '' teen angst'' and to label it to the point of not realizing the sex pistols was a band full of teen angst but people did and still love them . I don't compare the punk revival and punk pop bands to bands from the oldschool but what everyone is saying just reminds me how most of you guys are STILL teens and you are trying to tell everyone older (me) what we will expect and how we would feel . That makes no sense .Simple Plan is a band of quick , fun , angsty pop-punk revival songs .Punk is not what it used to be but everything changes . I never really did like oi punk . They were too angsty for me . I'll stick with my punk revival bands . Check out purevolume.com for some great bands and use soulseek ."
1,Everybody laugh and point at the sellout!!!,"These guys are sellouts and posers end of story. The bass player actually dares calling himself goth!!! He wears a black shirt on stage ooohhhh how goth!! I've seen 4 year old kids that look gother than he does. The guitarist, grow hair please for everyone's sake. Their music is very very very easy to play, and how boring. The lyrics are very researched and very emotional ""Shut up, shut up, shut up!"" Wow how on earth do they come up with that, they must be poets, seriously this is music that you only buy if youre thinking of a reason to kill yourself."
5,Good pop punk,"I'm not really into this kind of music anymore, but in high school Simple Plan was one of my favorite bands (Still Not Getting Any is actually the first cd I ever owned). Overall this album is not as good as their first album ""No Pads"" but there are some very good songs on here. SP matures somewhat in their lyrical content and the music is just as fun as ever. If you are into pop punk definitely check these guys out. While I wouldn't give this album 5 stars (I only did it because of the 1 star reviewer) for me this band reminds me of feeling out of place in high school and how music got me through it."
3,it is ok but not great,"the ramones are so much better so listen to better like Nirvana, Metallica, Taking back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World.They don't really have that many great guitar parts but they have a little.The lryics are ok but not really good.Good Charolette is the worest so don't ever listen to them."
1,simple plan is worst band on earth,"First of all, Simple PLan isn't punk....they are pretty boy pop singers that try and rip off great punk bands like green day and such. Second, if you can listen to the singer's voice without throwing up, then ur gifted cause i can't stand this guy. Bands like simple plan, good charlotte, and yellowcard are crappy pop bands that teenage girls buy and say are punk. If you want good punk albums check out offspring's smash, any of green day's cds, and rancid's out come the wolves. those are just some bands that own these geek losers... but alot are better than ""simple plan"" and such.Take my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Doesn't ROCK nearly enough!,"I heard these guys were a pretty good Canadian rock act but when I got the CD into my stereo and pressed play all I heard were power cords and singing that sounded put to tape without rehearsal. These guys have no chops. For better singing buy some Motley Crue. For better guitar playing buy any Poison or Warrant album. Those are real ROCK bands who put out quality music, not this rock for skate board kids. HAIR METAL rules!!!"
5,A TRUE must have!,"I must say, even though I was already blown away by Simple Plan's first album, that this CD definitely exceeded my expectations! The themes in the songs are much deeper, this album is more mature, & has a more rocking, alternative sound (not as poppy). The album is still catchy & there is no way that you won't find yourself singing along with Pierre. I haven't took it out of my CD player since I got it! So....what are you waiting for? BUY IY NOW! You WON'T be dissapointed!"
1,Punk Rawk!,"I just luv Simple Plan!They are the best Punk Rawk band ever! I hate it when people listen to Minor Threat, NOFX, The Casualties, the Dead Kennedys, and Pennywise and call themselves punk. Anybody with half a brain knows that those guys are POSERS! Real Punk Rawk is like Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, and the punkest punk rawker of all time...screw G.G. Allin, it's Avril Lavigne!(Busted, Mcfly, Sum 41, and Blink 182 rock too)Rawk ON!(That was sarcasm, Marge)"
1,STEP AWAY FROM THE POSERS KIDDIES,"Holy crap Simple Plan shouldnt be talking about how crap their life when clearly their really happy with their 100000000 dollas. Go listen to some REAL punk like Ramones Sex Pistols the Clash and Green Day but avoid these guys!!!!!One lil note: ""Untitled"" is why this album gets that 1 star"
1,Just Because Everyone Knows Them,"People seem to think this is a good band? what the hell? just becasue the media says it's a good band everyone's all like, oh well some idiot who doesn;t know sh*t about music says it's good, let's go buy it! that's when the music becomes a popularity thing, and the real music is forgotten when popular people begin to listen to it. Everyone knows that it sucks, but they listen anyway, and soon, they don;t know what music is. So what happened to the music? Man, the clash would probably try to go and take a big crap on these rich posers heads. In conclusion, this is not a band, it's a group of rich losers who sing about their girlfriends dumping them, who know nothing of music, don;t know how to play music, and are a disgrrace to the name of Punk Rock, (which they consider themselves) these guys are anything but punk.PEACE! OPERATION IVY AND THE CLASH FOREVER!"
4,Pretty good,"I borrowed this CD from my friend, but I still won't give it back becuase I've fallen in love with it so much. Sure, Simple Plan is not the best band, and their lyrics could be better, but overall they clearly depict alot of teenage agnst my friends and I feel. My personal favorites are Shut Up (can't everyone relate to this song?) Crazy (I can listen to it over and over and over..) and Untitled, a nice mellow and emotional finish. The choruses and beats are catchy, and I actually love the lead singer's voice!! This CD is just the right dose of pop-punk I need every once in a while. Not the best CD ever, but you should give it a chance."
1,Punk rock is not about dressing all in black! SP needs a major attitude adjustment,"Simple Plan is a bunch of whiny kids who want to be Green Day and think that dressing all in black will get them there. They have this strange obsession with writing really crappy songs about how much their little teenage souls suffer. And another thing, please, people, stop associating them with Good Charlotte. Because Good Charlotte is a real punk band that actually has songs with smart lyrics. Want real punk? Green Day, Good Charlotte, The Used, My Chemical Romance, etc."
1,You're addicted to you,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.. god.. these guys, along with Good Charlotte, should go back to hell. Cause God despises this ""music"", aka poser crap. It's a good thing I'm not a 11 year-old little boy or girl that likes this stuff, cause if i somehow ever liked this, I would've turned emo and killed myself. I'm not even going to name any bands that are better then this, because you could search for any band, and realize, ""Oh, my gawd, lyke, simple plan suxxors, and i'm just a dumb little boy or girl that cries because i lost a dollar bill! please, i niid that muney.. iff me dont have it, me won't b abul tu goh tu simpul plann concurt and kry wit alls me littul frends!"" =(! </3 ! ='("
1,LYKE OMG...,"Ok this is lyke.. teh best evahhhh. i meen serriuzly.SIMPLE PLAN = HARD RAWK FOREVAHHHforget those old Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, the Who, David Bowie, Metallica (at least, their new stuff ROX. their old stuff is soooo pop its not funny), The Offspring (ONLY their new cd SPLINTER)"
2,Emo at its best............,"In case you were thinking, I'm being sarcastic. This is the top of being emo, these guys do not rock and they are more pop than punk, and their song and lyrics are ""what"" and ""huh?""."
3,"Same Old, Same Old","Yeh ok its simple plan who said they would be harder and faster. Its lucky that good charlotte has bombed out coz otherwise this album may not have got far. Welcome Simple Plan, you are new band that kids around the world will worship. But its not enough for everyone else. ok so i am a sucker for simple plan. I don't have any idea why i do, but i do. This is an ok album, a bit too poppy but it is the market they are aiming for a spose. So in that case three stars for Crazy, me against the world and everytime and a few others were ok. Probly wont stay in the discman for long. But still an OK album."
1,why are these guys allowed to make music?,"There should be a law making it illegal for Simple Plan to write music. That way, people wouldn't be tortured by their boring, unoriginal lyrics and laughably elementary music. Plus, they would stop disgracing the real punk bands of the underground because, for, some God awful reason, people throw them into that category. Simple Plan is a joke of a band who seem to only write whiny songs about their ""hard life"". Why don't they just grow up, stop writing immature albums (Still Not Getting Any? Dude, last time I checked, you guys had graduated junior high), and realize that music is not their collective forte. That is, unless you like bland, boring, annoying pop-rock."
1,terrible,"really are the worst band evernot really a band, actuallynot even close to a band, reallymusic? no. torture."
1,Lousy Album..worth less than 1,"wow, what an awful CD, its sucks so hardcore! do NOT get influeneced by the idiots who gave this CD a good review because in reality, it sucks. Simple Plan and Sum 41 and Blink-182 and good charlotte and other posers like them are a joke, how did they get there start in the music biz?giving head? probably...Still not getting any...wonder why?either cause they are gay or because their lousy music turns all the chicks away and turns on 10 year old girls.(thats against the law, guys from simple plan)anyways this CD is just pure crap, do not waste your money and time on this. want a good CD? go buy master of puppets or reign in blood or bonded by blood, not this crap!"
1,where is punk going?,"These guys suck. Just another punk, commercial band who whines about their lives. They try and put out a hard core ""true punk"" type image but when you hear their music it's so soft and alternative (not to metion annoying) that you would probably hear it at an elementay school dance. Where is punk going? They need to join Blink 182, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Sum 41, and Green Day all into a big group of punk bands who all sound alike and suck"
1,Shut The He!! Up Already,You friggen losers are horrible. Stop playin your damm music and join the cheerleading team u losers. I mean how dare you call urselves punk... I mean you whiney b*sterds just complain about how hard your life is. Shut up! u just want attention. Oh yah still not getting any eh. Thats cuz nobody likes u so just go away!Reccomend please:p
2,mediocre,Most of the songs on this album sound very very similar. These guys take no chances. Everything is just ok. They need to try something new instead of just puking out the same song over and over again.
1,LOL THIS PROVES IT!,"Today i overheard this ditzy 13 year old girl saying that her cousin who was also 13, used a program and got on a picture with PEE-AIR. And then she says something like: ""OO MY GOSH THEY ARE SO COOOOOL!!!!"""" This proves that simple plan is a poser band for teeny boppers.P.S.1 of the members pretends to be gothic."
1,"no,no,no people!","Ok, Simple Plan, is simply don't buy it. They may play their own instruments, but that doesn't mean they are great. Their album names are lame and not creative at all. it sucks, really. there are so many other bands out there to listen too. i don't seem enthralled with this band, i don't think they have much to work with. also they play on TRL so much, which is not such a acomplishment. They aren't really that 'punk-rock'.. come on. with those dumb titles?! really, get serious. real punk rockers would puke all over this. they'd be ashamed. if you like them, well you do, but i sure don't. check out other bands, and maybe you'll find this CD, eventually.. getting to the back of that shelf of yours."
1,LOL THESE GUYS CRACK ME UP!,"THESE GUYS SUCK!! They are for ditzy teens who just care about how they got dumped after 1 week by their so-called ""girlfriend. Lyrics to one of their songs:SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UPWow that pretty much just explains what I think of them. Their first album's name was something about just balls. Well still not gettin any was a name they didn't get to finish. It should have been Still not gettin any balls.1 more thing that absolutely makes me laugh at them is that 1 of their guitarists last name is stinco.P.S.Green day is sweet"
5,only the best cd ever,this cd is the best. you can tell how much work was put into this and how the guys have grown. from track one to eleven all the songs you can relate to. they have catchy lyrics and awesome beats. it's definetly worth buying. plus it's the first dualdisc. what could be cooler?!
5,simple plan still not getting any.. cd rocks,"i think the new simple plan cd still not getting any... is a lot darker and more rock then the last cd i love it and there music seems like it has grown more then there last ablum no pads, no helmet....just balls which is also a very good cd too i advise any one who is into pop/rock music to go out and get the simple plan cd because it is a very good cd."
4,Still Good,"If you liked the first album, you will certainly like this one. While I haven't heard any tunes that I think will be huge singles, the album is full of fun songs that hold up to repeated listens."
3,Good...but bad,"Simple Plan is a great band. Their music amazing, with lyrics that you can relate to, no matter who you are.But I don't like how they keep calling themselves ""punk"". By saying this, they are calling themselves, to put it plainly, POSERS.But I really do like this album, but Simple Plan needs to adjust their image to fit their music style."
4,Good.,"I'm not a kid, but I don't want make an account. Okay, this is not punk, but okay. This group gets a four out of five, it's pretty good. People who say this is crap, shut up. There is no kind of music that sucks, only people don't like them. EVERY piece of music is beautiful, from Beethoven's 9th symphony to Green Day or Eminem or whatever. Anything that people like and can appreciate the beauty in is music. **** all you people saying all these newer bands suck. If I like it, it's music, and it's GOOD music."
5,SNGA,"This album is amazing. Everyone can relate to the lyrics and it isn't an album where every song sounds the same. If you loved the first album, you have to go out and buy this one. I guarantee you'll love it just as much if not more. The dvd side is an added bonus full of fun footage so you can get your fix of the guys if you can't make it to a concert anytime soon.Even if you weren't a simple plan fan after the last album, go out and buy this one. I have a feeling you'll be changing your mind."
5,AWESOME!!,I bought Simple Plan's SNGA... cd and dvd the day it came out. This is an awesome cd!! The songs are wicked good plus you get a dvd to go with it. I am a huge SP fan and I definatly recomend this cd to everyone!!
1,NO stars as well,"I believe that in order to recieve even one star, you must accomplish something. Although they have; being unbelievably whiney, and plugging up the channels with this so called ""music"", they do NOT get my vote. Its pretty much kicked up country music with a little more drums...and of course, more whiney, nasely vocals....if that is what you would call it. I was embarrassed to have bought a ticket to Rock Em' Ring Germany just for having them do the commentary."
1,Yuck,"I've had the misfortune to hear the music on this CD from a friend's cousin...good god. They are about as punk rock as George Bush. Overproduced, soulless, corporate garbage.Real punk is The Exploited, GBH, Crass, Misfits, Ramones, Rudimentary Peni, Conflict, Varukers, Leftover Crack, Circle Jerks, Black Flag, UK Subs, Discharge, Bad Religion, Casualties, Negative Approach, Doom, etc."
1,Give Me a Break,"Simple Plan is another one of those terrible bands that think they are hard and punk. I saw the video for ""Shut Up"" where they think they are some loud heavy and offensive band. The truth is that if you are not a female and over 12 you shouldnt be listening to this garbage. And if you are listening to this, you might as well be listening to O-town. The only good news is that by refusing to change their corny style Simple Plan has long since peaked and is going nowhere but down to finally end their flash in the pan."
5,Simple Plan,"The Simple Plan CD is the best CD because Pierre, Chuck, Jeff, Sebastien, and David write all the songs and they tell the truth about life. They don't try to make their life seem perfect like all the other singers/bands. Welcome to my life is the best song on the CD because it tells about Pierre's life. I can relate to his life. I love Pierre."
5,omg people wut the heck is wrong with u,this is the best cd ever! there voices arent like fake there real. unlike some bands. there a hot and fresh band. who could not love this cd!
1,>.<,"Okay, let's face it. Simple Plan has lost their...glow. I loved the song 'Perfect' on their other CD, but this one is just...ugh. There are no words to describe it.I for one think they sound like Good Charlotte. Only more whinier. Let's compare, shall we? Good Charlotte has numerous songs of their dad walking out on them, and Simple Plan's 'Perfect' is almost identical to them. People confuse Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. I wonder why.This CD sucked. Don't buy it, it's a waste of $15. Go buy the Use, or My Chemical Romance instead. Or Hawthorne Heights."
1,too bad you can't give 0 stars,"this is seriously the worst kind of crap. i actually listened to this album, thankfully i didn't waste my money on it. there is nothing original or even slightly good about it. in fact, i had a hard time trying to find something about it that doesn't make me want to plug my ears with forks. it's horrible. but what's worse is the fact that they get all these other posers that think dying their hair and piercing their lip makes them individuals. punk rock is finally dead."
5,Still Getting...My Attention!,"I have only listened to four songs on the CD, ""Crazy,"" ""Shut Up!,"" ""Welcome To My Life,"" and the track with no name. They areall excellent songs in my opinion. Buy not only this, but theirdebut, No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls. Why is it called thatanyway?"
3,Disapointing...,"I was a huge simple plan fan. I loved their whole jumpy attitude and catchy lyrics. The lyrics were funny, happy, and easy to relate to. That, however, was them on the first album, No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls.I really didn't like Still Not Getting Any at all. The songs came off to me as whiny, tacky and repetitive and annoying after listening to the CD a few times.All in all, their first album is MUCH better. If you want to hear the real Simple Plan, ignore Still Not Getting Any."
5,*amazing record*,"Pick up Simple Plan's new record ""Still Not Getting Any..."" It's a great album. They guys really did not disappoint their fans. It's a more mature album from their debut. They have harder-hitting songs. This album is amazing - content wise and lyrically. If you're not usually into this kind of music, this album just might change your mind."
5,2nd Time Around!,"Ok, I loved Simple Plan's first album, but I know some people didn't. This album is SO totally different from the first. This album has a song for everyone. Some songs are more up beat and will get you going for the day. Others are more emotional. Either way everyone can relate to atleast one song on this album. If you didn't like the first album PLEASE check this one out, and if you did you'll love this one!!"
5,"Simple Plan ""Still Not Getting Any"" Review","I love this cd. I have been listening to this for about two weeks and I am still not tired of it. I love this and I will be listening to it in my car, on the way to school, on the way back, basically everywhere i go. Simple Plan ROCK ON FOREVER!"
1,"Whiney, annoying, and unoriginal","This CD sucks so bad. This is the type of music that sixth and seventh grade girls listen to because ""the lead singer is hot!"". Simple Plan has no talent. They are 100% pop, you cannot even call this punk-pop. All of the songs sound the same, and they all sound like every other band out there. They started out as a ""funny"" band, and now that it is the ""cool"" thing to do to go all dark and moody as a band, they jump on the bandwagon and all of a sudden they're supposedly dark. And the song ""Welcome to My Life"" is the biggest load of bulldookie I have ever heard. They are all a bunch of rich snots who don't know how much they have, so they complain that they don't have enough. Kind of like Good Charlotte's song the ""rich and the famous"". Well, look who's rich and famous now. If you want real pop-punk then check out Bowling for Soup."
1,Jesoose,"Wow. As a former fan of simple plan it surprises me to hear myself say that this is the worst album of all time. Why didn't I see it before? They keep writing about the same message over and over again... Kids are misunderstood, We all hate our parents. Blah di Blah hey. ""No one ever lies straight to your face And no one ever stabbed you in the back You might think I'm happy But I'm not gonna be ok""... They've even given up on making things rhyme. Seriously Pierre, you've got to be twenty something... will you stop writing about high school kids who just hate life? They're not even his life experiences. So I'd say save your money and don't get this stupid album. I finally get the whole simple plan is a poser band thing now. I've pretty much given up fighting it, cause it's true damnit."
2,"How many ""pop-punk"" bands must there be?","Simple Plan is a bunch of lazy, MTV sellouts. The only thing that keeps me from giving this album a one is ""Untitled"". It has a lot of emotion, and it reminds me of Straylight Run. (Which is'nt a bad thing, because they are so much better than Simple Plan.) Too bad a song that powerful was wasted on such a talentless band."
5,Simple Plan rocks!!,"Simple Plan has done it again, they're second cd Still Not Getting Any... is the best yet. On the Dualdisc you get a CD and DVD in one! The footage is is really cool, it shows behind the scenes look at recording the record. On the other side is the CD featuring upbeat in your face type songs such as Shut Up!, and the new single Welcome To My Life. Then there are other songs that are more guitar spotlight and a slower pace such as Perfect World and Everytime. This is no miss. Simple Plan has done it again."
1,They're BACK!,"Wow! The rich pretty boys are back on stage. This time they found more things to conplain about. Such as how hard their life is. Wait a second though. They are rich. What do they not have that they want. When was a celebrity ever thrown into the dirt as mentioned in the song ""Welcome to my Life."" Well here we go again. More crapy teeny bobby music is on its way."
1,This Sucks,"Simple plan is a bunch of pop punks trying to say there punk, when labels are stupid. I see pictures of them and they try to hard to be punks or whatever you people call them, Its the wrose album ever, and there on MTV..And what were they thinking when they made Bad religon song?..IF you like this, then thats fine, But i really dont understand it..but thats my thoughts..and MTV ROCKS..Most of the bands u named from back then are not posers..Cause there on mtv means jack..Get a life"
4,Buy this CD...even for just one song,"I don't mean the rest songs are bad,but this one-""Untitled"" is so outstanding.I wasn't a SP fan before,even I've heard their previous singles,and maybe like them but just a little.And you know here in China,this CD isn't released,the hit singles""Shut Up""&""Welcome To My Life""just didn't make me buy this CD,you know an import.Till I heared their lastest single ""Untitle"",so unluckily, I didn't notice this song before,and then I went out and bought this CD,althought a Japan-import's price is about five-fold as much as a China-made CD is,but it's worth,anyway,the other songs aren't bad.Is that punk or what,who cares,just buy it!"
1,Still Horrible,"Simple Plan returns again to damage the ears of everyone who hears their 'music'. Their first single ""Welcome To My Life"" is the most feminine song that I have ever heard. While 'singing' the lead vocalists voice sounds like a woman, young boy who hasn't reached puberty, or someone who has clogged nostrils belting out annoying songs about how the world is so harsh to middle class white teenagers. ""Shut Up"" is another horrible song off of this album, which my friend just had to listen to in my car one day. Afterwards, I promised my car that I would never allow sewage like that to be played through its speakers ever again. What happened to the good rock music? Remember Def Leppard, Metallica, and Van Halen? They have sadly been replaced by pop punk and emo garbage, as well as idiotic death metal. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this disgrace to rock music."
1,Sly businessmen... Or just idiots?,"Yea, i know. It's ""cool"" to bash on these punk-pop bands... According to the bloody SOAD lovers at just about every high-school in the world. We all know how crap this band and all the others exactly like it are. So there's not much point in saying why this so. Oh, and the only reason that I reviewed this piece of $#!@ is because Simple Plan happen to be the favorite band of this girl I really like at school. Her name is.... I won't say it in case she reads this review... Very very unlikely though...And for those who enjoy listening to good music. Hang in there, it will become cool again. We just need another Nirvana-esque explosion from the underground scene. Not nessasarily a Nirvana-esque band though. Definetly not, actually.Well, these Simple Plan guys are either complete idiots, or extremely smart ""business-men"". Damn, they must have *alot* of money right now."
5,Great Cd!!,This cd is great! There is not one song on the cd that isn't good or not worth listening to. Every song is different from the next and all have there own unique meaning. This is one of the best cd's that I have heard in awhile and Simple Plan should keep up the excellent work!
5,Best disc EVER!,"Simple Plan is one of the hottest band in our current music world, if you know about music, then this is the disc that you want to buy, every single song in here is about teenagers who had problems, and in these songs they stand up to those people who bring us down all the time. Simple plan is an excellent band and I look forward for their next disc."
1,it's easy.,"how to make it big in the rock and roll industry1. Dress up like anarchists, but write songs about how crappy it is being an adolescent in a middle class society in Canada2. write a bunch of songs for the radio and if you get the big paycheck, do the same thing for your next album, only change a chord or two.3. get on TRL and have your customers also pick out selections from Ashlee Simpson."
1,Shut up!,"Please simple plan, shut up, like your song says. You are not meant for the music industry, unless you think complaining about your ""horrible"" life is good music. I would not reccomend this album, or their other album."
1,"Simple Plan=whiny, annoying posers","Simple Plan is, to me, a bunch of posers. The songs are whiny and I think that this band fails to take in the big picture. They also call themselves ""PUNK"", which really annoys me. The songs, though annoying, are not that bad. But they are definitely not punk. Punk is Green Day, Good Charlotte, Bowling For Soup, etc. By calling their music punk, they are basically admiting that they are a bunch of posers. The songs are kind of pointless, and I think that my dog could write better lyrics-atleast his might be interesting.If you are thinking about buying this CD because you read or heard that this is a punk band, and you like punk, I'm going to tell you that you really shouldn't buy this, because they are definitely not punk. If you're looking for punk, take a look at Green Day and such. But hey, if you like SP, go ahead and buy it."
1,Zero Stars,"College MetalfreakHaha. Simple Plan sucks. Good lord, how can a band suck as much as this one. Seriously, how can anybody listen to this crap. It's not music by the way, it's just a bunch of whiny girls in their twenties wishin' they were men. All the songs on this album flat out suck. I hope this band is through. The lead singer Pierre, what a stupid name, is such a loser. I have never heard a more annoying voice in my life. It's like finger nails on a chalkboard. It sounds like all the members are porn-addicted masturbators. Btw, if you're a guy (I am) and you do this, you're a loser, plain and simple.Also, Eliza Dushku is such a gorgeous woman. I thought it was so awesome in the video to the horrific ""I'm Just a Kid"" (only seen it once) when she dumped these wimps, including that stupid, loser bandgeek boy, at the end. It's reassuring to know that a beautiful, intelligent, and strong woman like her won't fall for immature, pathetic babies like them."
1,This band sucks!,No one should waste their time listening to this trash. They have to be one of the worst rock/pop bands ever. This music is gay and I recommend listening to pretty much any other musican. Simple Plan almost makes Ashley Simpson look like a pretty good singer.
3,need something more user friendly,"I've had this book for about 3 months and have only tried one idea. That particular one didn't work. I'm sure many more of the activities are great, but it takes time to read through the book and figure out what to do. Maybe I'll have more time this summer, but a teacher usually needs something more easily accessible."
1,go to home depot,Home Depot sells this filter off the shelf for $29.98. Why is the same filter 2x more here?
1,Terrible,"I personally thought the book was terrible , The way that he skipped around and the way that hed talk about things that are completly irrevalent to whats going on. Im 15 and have never heard anyone swear that much, it makes him sound incredibly ignorant and the author mustive assumed that every juvenile swears constantly"
3,You either love it or hate it,"I had to read this book for my grade 12 english class and normally I hate being forced to read material I'm not interested in but I heard about this book and I was told I'd either love it or hate it. I'm leaning more towards the love. Finally an assigned English book that was actually worth my time! However, Holden's use of repetition really gets to you and sometimes that's all you think about...how phoney those people are that he talks about and how everything is ""corny"". The book does have a point. And I think as a teenager I really related to his feelings and his constant cynism. Unfortunately, that comes with the teenage years. ""Catcher in the Rye"" is also a lot like Sylvia Plath's ""The Bell Jar"". The only difference in those 2 books were that the main character's were of the opposite sex. These books are kind of a ""find yourself"" guide in the teenage years. It's always good to know your not alone and that you can relate to someone."
3,This is a different and difficult read,"A friend gave me this book to read. This was a very conflicting story to read. Thought Eric was selfish and should have stood by his decison to stay away. Somewhat admire Breck, she did not become a kept or dependent women. If and when the relationship ended she could take care of herself financially. In the end one child saved the other. Maybe that was God devine plan."
5,What about Men Only!!,"So I got this book from my friend who demanded that I read it. I started the book with laughter and ended it with tears. Breck was sucessful and independent, and didn't need a man for nothing. Eric said it best you should be able to share your world completly with the one you love. Breck was the one that he could share everything with, when he was with his wife Gaby he was only the shell of the person Breck was in love with. I was just like Eric before he called Breck and they shared that first conversation. You can't be in love with more than one person at a time but after reading this book I see how easy it can happen. I'm in love with ERIC!!! I had Breck's back when Gaby hit her, I was ready to jump into the pages and fight Gaby for her. I finished this book and started reading it all over again. I recommend that any and everyone read this book!!"
5,Great Read,"I first stumbled across this book in the library and I had never before heard of Darlene Johnson. I feel in love with this book. Although I don't condone cheating, this book gave an inside view of what the other woman feels dating a married man. I do feel that what Breck and Eric shared was real and beautiful but wrong and forbidden. The issues of this book goes deeper than cheating, it shows how important it is to get fully involved in the life of the one you love. Ultimately, that is what connected Breck and Eric; she shared his passion and supported it. I highly recommend this book. I have read this book so many times I have lost count. A love that is taboo and forbidden but still is real."
2,"I'm not a psychic, but this was so predictable...","The story of an affair, from the point of view of the other woman. It seemed trite to me, how everything was soooooooooo right between Eric and Breck (the mistress, all I could think of was shampoo every time I read her name). The wife came off as cold-hearted, of course. Very stereotypical affair story, nothing really surprising. The end was ridiculously shortchanged. It was the only really interesting part, and the author chopped it down to several pages. Boring, boring climax."
4,From both sides of the fence...,"This novel was disturbingly compelling. It conjured up negative feelings being a wife of someone who has strayed. I was also very true because being in love with one and married to another is a very hard thing to do. When realizing you have married the wrong one, what do you do? I got really sick of Breck's whining and tantrums. She came in eyes wide open. It also looks better from the other side of the fence and protecting your heart is not easy business. She could have avoided it but then, we not have had a book to enjoy. Read it for yourself and get in touch with the emotions it brings to surface."
4,SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT,This was a very good book with a very good twist. When I first began to read the book it bored me with to much dialogue but as the story went on it just got better and better. The story was very insightful to me as a woman - I don't condone having an affair but it diminished alot of stereotypes that I had regarding women that deal with married men. I recommend this book especially to any woman that is trying to keep her man!
4,for absolute beginners,"I use this book for a course in the first semester. The students are not familiar with deeper mathematical ideas (not even with the one of a limit), but still thanks to Klir's book they are able to follow a kind of up-to-date mathematics. One of the advantages of the book is that all the principal ideas (operations, relations, logic) are firstly explained in the crisp case and then in the fuzzy case."
4,A very entertaining Jackie Chan movie,"This is one of Jackie's best movies. He really seems to be interested in showing the audience a good time. The opening chase is great, the fight scenes are good, and the wonderfully over the top finale has probably the most broken panes of glass in any movie. The only let down is that some of the comedy is really over done. Apart from that, it's a corker!"
5,Whether you like Chan or not (and who doesn't really?)... you gotta see this!,"At least once, although after seeing it... once is never enough! So this is the action/martial arts hybrid movie that has set the gold standard for all the others to come. Many have tried to duplicate it and few have rarely even come close(even it's sequels pale in comparison). Jackie stars and directs masterfully pushing the limits of exciting camera work and of course action and stunts. There are plenty of scenes here worth mention but I think it's best to go in without any forewarning of what's to come. Dragon Dynasty has put out another great DVD(although the picture is a little grainy) with some fantastic bonus features. One of Jackie Chans finest moments, and in a career full of them, this is a can't miss."
3,Too slow to justify a higher rating,"Don't get me wrong, the fight scenes and action sequences are great, but this movie is so slow inbetween. Now when you have action scenes every ten minutes, it's ok, but there are few in this film, and they are normally a good 20 minutes inbetween each one. I am a huge Chan fan, and while some of his movies are the absolute best example of the genre, quite a few are either just plain bad or have too few action scenes. Even though I haven't seen all of his films (that's a lot- just do a search with his name on this website to see, and that isn't even all of them.) I have seen enough to know there is much better than this. I prefer realistic fighting films (ie no wire-fu, etc.) and that's why I love Chan, Sammo, Yuen, some Jet Li, etc. If you want a list of some films in this vein, email me and I'll give you the list of the ones I know and love."
2,Not the best Jackie Chan movie,"Get Operation Condor or First Strike. They are much better. This movie is somewhat mean-spirited for a Chan flick. Good stunts as always, but not enough to make the film work."
3,Jackie Getting Started,"I have always been a Jackie Chan fan. This, however is a dated Hong Kong action movie. Some fun to be had - but mostly a lot of really silly people running around firing their pistols badly. To be fair, you can see how Jackie Chan was perfecting the special style that he brings to the big screen so effectively in his more recent movies. See this flick and move on to his newer titles with far superior production values along with excellent scripts.My short list of ""mo better"" Jackie Chan films are:The Legend of Drunken MasterJackie Chan's First StrikeOperation CondorJackie Chan's Who Am I?Shanghai NoonAdd these wonderful DVD's to your collection and enjoy many times over."
3,Mr. Skeffington,I loved the movie Mr. Skeffington with Bette Davis and Claude Rains so much that I've watched it several times. So I was really looking forward to reading the book.But sadly I was disappointed. For me the movie was far better than the book. I felt like the two (movie and book) were not even realted. I had a difficult time staying with the book to the end. [...]
3,Interesting Read,"I loved the language in this book! The story takes place in Hitler era. English woman recovering from illness dreads her 50th Birthday.A story of looking back upon ones life. This is a slow read,nothing to be gobbled up. I enjoyed the writing."
2,I too do not like the camera work.,I agree--the camera jumping from one shot to another in a second or even less makes me nervous. Regretfully I cannot recommend this DVD nor the others in this series.
1,Spiritual Matters Are Spiritually Discerned,"Human logic and reasoning are wonderful gifts from God, However spiritual matters are discerned spiritually:1Co 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.The fact is you will not learn the truth of this matter reading a book by some egghead theologian. The answers that you seek will be given by study of the Word and prayer. The KJV itself ultimately proves it's superiority to those that take the time to study and cherish it.There are no shortcuts. If you depend on your pastor some author or anyone else to discern the truth for you you are in deep spiritual trouble my friend. It is about a personal relationship with Christ.God bless you in your search for the truth."
5,A Five Star Book By A Christian Liar,"If you waste your time, effort, or money on this book, be sure to read the book that answers this one called ""The Scholarship Only Controversy: Can You Trust The Proffessional Liars?"" by Dr. Peter S. Ruckman. James White attempts to justify Bible corruption with the same attitude toward the holy words of God that was seen in D.A. Carson and Stewart Custer. Carson asked in 1979 ""Since no translation is perfect, how can we know what the Holy Spirit inspired the Biblical writers to write?"" Nowhere in his book does he answer his own question. James White's book is twice as long and twice as pathetic."
1,A BOOK OF LIES AND DECEPTIONS,"This book is not worth the paper it was printed on. Jesus Christ the Son of God PROMISED that His words would NOT pass away. Jesus said, "" Heaven and Earth SHALL pass away, but My WordS (plural) Shall NOT pass away "" Matthew 24:35. Well if you look at ALL the other ""bible"" Perversions accept THE AUTHORIZED VERSION (also known as the King James Bible) there are Verse MISSSING all over the place. Either Jesus Christ LIED ""or"" this book is a Satanically Inspired Bunch of GARBAGE and James White is a FALSE Prohet. Tkae your pick for it one or the other ....either Jesus lied or James White is a FALSE Prophet....Choose you this day whom you will serve?"
5,Excellent for layman to scholar,"James White has done a excellent job covering the subject. He is thorough in providing manuscript evidence, yet readable enough for the average layman. Instead of resorting to name-calling and circular reasoning, White lets history and the manuscript evidence speak for themselves. Especially insightful is his chapter on the deity of Christ (""The Son of God, the Lord of Glory""), which decidedly proves there is no conspiracy by modern translators to denegrate our Lord Jesus Christ. Even if you do not come away agreeing with every conclusion, you will understand why modern translations read the way they do. The modern conservative versions are not ""New Age"", but sincere attempts to come closer to God's truth.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is trying to resolve this issue for themselves, or to someone seeking material to present to a Sunday School class or Bible study."
3,Refuting T-Dogg,"In response to T-Dogg and the supposed contradictions in the KJV, here is a explanation that addresses 2 of his ""contradictions in the KJV"". The others can just as quickly be refuted if you take the time to think though them or find commentary from learned biblical scholars. Here is a great example:http://www.geocities.com/brandplucked/8or18.htmlThis is in response to the T-Dogg Review. The apparent contradictions he lists actually add more credence to the literal translation of the KJV rather than add fuel to the superiority of his more modern translations. I won't go into great detail, as it is beyond the scope of my reply here, but these so insinuated ""open and shut"" verses are hardly open and shut. I post this not as a review of this book, but as a refute to T-Dogg's post as automatically dismissing the superiority of the KJV."
1,White's Book Soils the Hands,"Although I agree with James White in principle -- that the KJV is simply one of many good translations -- his book displays a lack of understanding of the depth of this issue. His statements lapse far too freqently into emotionally-charged harangues belittling his opponents (attacks on their intelligence, guilt by association, etc.). Very infreqently did he seem to endeavor to comprehend their viewpoint. Regardless of whether I agree with his view, this alone is enough to render his conclusions suspect. In failing to crawl outside of his own paradigm -- even for a moment -- White has created not a text which refutes KJV-Onlyism but a slim justification for his own opinions (which are sometimes unfounded). Better books already exist on the topic, so don't purchase this one."
1,Great Facts....?,"Upon reading this book, I thought, ""How can any King James Only person stand in light of his arguments?"" So, I went in and tried debating with a staunch Ruckmanite and... I lost. It seems as though many of the ""facts"" that James presents were too great, because I was caught off guard several times, especially concerning 1 Peter 1:1 & 1 Peter 1:11, where I found out that the King James' Text is actually different that what James White quoted. The Johnannine Comma for the KJO group is a hard one for them, but apart from that, I am almost convinced that ""monogenes theos"" in the modern translations has some influence to Gnosticism now, because of lack of evidence on White's part. Beware, and make sure what you use out of his book is accurate-- or you, too, will be caught off guard."
1,Poorly Argued,The book claims to be a refutation of those who believe the King James Bible is the only English Bible properly translated from the proper texts. Instead he erects straw man arguments and knocks them down. Only the intellectually weak will be influenced by such a poor work. An online demonstration of his faulty reasoning can be found at: http://wayoflife.org/fbns/examining01.htm; Perhaps White should have read Revision Revised by Burgon or the actual writings of Westcott and Hort. Apparently research is not of interest to him.
1,A SATANIC BLASPHAMOUS GARBAGE FALSEHOOD DECEPTION,"This book is FULL OF LIES, DISTORTIONS AND DECEPTIONS. If you are looking for the TRUTH Of God's Word then remember what Jesus Christ the Son Of Almighty God PROMISED in God's Word the Bible, "" Heaven and Earth Shall Pass Away, But My WordS (plural) shall NOT pass away "" Matthew 24:35. Well if you look at ALL the SO-CALLED ""bible"" PERVERSIONS of today they are' All ' "" MISSING VERSES "" Left and Right, like Matthew 18:11, Mark 9:44,46 &48 and Acts 8:37 Just To Name A FEW... So what that comes down to is: Either Jesus Christ LIED----because his words have Passed Away because there are verses MISSING all over the modern ""bible"" perversions or James White ia a FALSE Prophet! It's either or? Take your pick! The Son Of God's promise or the words of a Sinner-who is a False Prophet. ""CHOOSE Ye this day whom ye will serve"""
1,Read Dr. Jones' Book,"If you want the other side of the issue, ""Which Version Is The Bible?"" by Floyd Nolen Jones is an excellent resource.This book documents maticulously how the traditional Greek New Testament text (which is the basis of the historic versions by Tyndale, Luther, Coverdale, KJV, and others) was cast aside by revisionist in 1881.Also carefully documented is the process which produced the radically different Greek text of the modern versions including an analysis of textual criticism. The completely unscientific basis of the methods of textual criticism are also exposed, and evidence that the traditional Greek text is actually much older than the newer critical text of the modern versions is presented.The work is carefully footnoted and includes a complete and comprehensive bibliography and index."
1,You can trust anything but the King James Bible,"As is with most typical scholarship, this book attempts to build your faith in men and knock down your faith in God's word. Filled with half truths and outright lies, this book successfully convinces only people who have done no reasearch of their own that versions like the NIV and NASV are reliable and that the KJV is not. I give it a 2 because the cover looks good and White actually admits that 1st Timothy 3:16 is correct as it is translated in the KJV. Unfortunatly it does not BOTHER him that the modern translations have removed God from this verse!"
1,James R. White MISNAMED his book,"Why did James call his book, ""The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?"" is because he is anti-KJV man. Another writer said that James SHOULD name his book, ""Ruckman/Riplinger Controversy."" I read this book and found James' spurious comments in his book. James is a Calvinist himself. He refuted Ruckman, Riplinger and other KJV onlyists concerning their belief upon the KJV only. He is wrong to refute them concerning the KJV superiority. The KJV Onlyism and the KJV superiority are NOT same. I do NOT recommend this book because of many false answers against the KJV superiority, NOT the KJV only."
2,Library reject,"Quite apparently, this was a library book. There are four large labels on the outside, including a large, white label for when the book was stamped out and one on the spine. Also, the edge of the pages are stamped with the library's name and address. While the interior of the book is in ""very good"" condition, the exterior was certainly a surprising disappointment. Looks like it was taken/stolen from a library."
2,appearance different than advertised,"The book was supposedly in good shape. I disagree. The cover was ripped and the book was worn hard. All the books I ordered from where Warrior's Path was purchased were in much worse shape than the ""good"" that was advertised. I will not purchase from that company again."
1,Questionable History,"The book is an interesting story, but I would have expected the history to be more accurate. Hopefully no one is learing their American History from Louis L'Amour. He refers to the Plymouth Colony as the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and they were two separate groups. They eventually merged, but not in 1630. The main group of the Massachusetts Bay Colony didn't even arrive until 1630 when this story supposedly takes place. The logistics are also bad. I find it unbelievable that two men from the Blue Ridge in Carolina (can't find any history of white men on the Blue Ridge in 1630) could have been found and have made their way to Massachusetts overland to help rescue kidnap victims. Historical fiction can help us learn our history, but not this fiction."
1,Thankfully all paths have exits!,"I read this on a coach journey, what can i say? At least the coach was nice!"
5,Terrific series,"A wonderful trip into the taming of early America by its settlers -- wrapped in action, adventure and character study. Plan to read the whole series. It's that good."
3,Disappointed,"A rather light but engaging read. It is not so much about David and expounding on the theme of ""a man after God's own heart"" as it is about proclaiming the gospel - which is always a good thing but when you are expecting to learn more about or read more insight into the life of David, it is unfulfilling. You can learn a little more about the story of David by reading this book, but not much more than simply reading the accounts in the scripture."
5,J. Vernon McGee,I've listened to McGee for 40 years and find his teachings so simple and yet profound. I enjoy anything by Vernon McGee.
5,good deal,"Its hard to find these in a two pack. They are much cheaper this way. Most aquariums have two bulb sockets, so they should all be sold in two packs."
2,Extremely Yellow,"I bought this hoping to replace the 10W florescent that my tank came with. These lights are EXTREMELY yellow, and don't look good at all compared to a florescent. I would absolutely go with the 10W florescent every time over this light. It's a good price, but not the product I was hoping for."
4,Meet John Doe DVD B&W,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. All Americans should see it to remind us what is really important. Bravo!!!
1,Ughh!,"Great movie but terrible presentation! Stay away from anything Madacy puts out on DVD. Definitely could have been better, sound and picture-wise. You definitely get what you pay for...."
2,"Great movie, horrible DVD release.","As for this classic you can't go wrong. Frank Capra could not have had a better cast for this fun comic look at the 40's. If only this DVD release had been done by the major studios or DVD manufacturer. The quality of the TGG Direct is poor at best, as the second TGG movie I have in my collection I would never buy their products again. The price reflects the quality as well, the Silvering on my DVD is already starting to show signs of delaminating from the plastic. Suggestion, buy this movie, but from another manufacturer!!!!"
3,low quality version,"I love this movie and I think the final scene is one of the best in moviedom. On its own it is five stars; however, this dvd edition is simply awful in quality and should be given one star. I typically disagree with those who review anything but content but in this case I feel it is necessary. Spend the extra money on the newer digitally remastered version and don't sell one of the all-time classics short!"
2,Great service/ low quality product,"The print was awful, and the sound even worse. The movie started in the middle of a scene,about a third of the way through, so the first act wasn't even there. This was a hard to find item, so I only fault the seller for not warning about the condition of the movie."
1,terrible,"Meet John DoeThe transfer is so bad ,that despite the fact that this is a great movie ,the poor quality both visually and audibly pulls your attention away from the story.I originally bought this because of the price. I am now going to spend more money to get a good copy of the film. From now on I am going to read the bad reviews before purchasing anything at Amazon."
3,Cooper has had better to work with,"There is nothing wrong with the cast and crew of this film; Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyick, Walter Brennan, director Frank Capra. Somehow though, this film doesn't quite work. It is way too gooey and for the melodrama of the film contains surprisingly little substance. There are certainly better films to own. ""Meet John Doe"" would be a disappointment at any price."
2,Meet John Doe,"All round silly movie.John Doe(Gary Cooper)is the nicest person in the world who tells everybody he will kill himself if the world doesnt change.(As if the world could care less)Barbra Stanwyck is Johns love intest.Save your money.Gary,Barbra,and Dir Frank Capra made much better than this.More silly,Id say,than funny."
1,Meet John Doe,"I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie. I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found. Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe. I guess it's a little late to complain now!"
2,weak,"This movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It's a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can't hit a home run every time). I found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on. And no extra features on the dvd, at least none to speak of."
1,need sea-sickness pills to watch,"This was a terrible copy. The image moves up and down just enough so you need sea-sickness pills after a few minutes. Sound was terrible too. I suspect they called it ""remastered"" to try to escape the previous collection of bad reviews of the ""enhanced"" [...]BTW, while waiting for delivery, I checked out a DVD from the local public library which was decent. Only the occasional jump. Decent sound too. [...]"
2,Great Movie--BAD copy,"The movie (story, actors, actresses, etc) was SUPER! Another great Capra movie but the quality is awful. Don't expect good, clear Turner Classic Movie Channel quality. In some spots the background is so bright you can't even see the faces of the actors. I'm going to buy a good version of this eventually because it is worth the extra money! BUY BETTER QUALITY!!"
1,Remastered RIP!,"This information is for the Remastered Edition of ""Meet John Doe"" concerning the poor video quality. At $20 for the download version this is a rip-off. This version of this great film has very low resolution, old quality, and washed out depth (poor VHS source?). Also, the sound is not synchronized with the video. A pathetic release of an American classic - shame on those involved with this mess."
1,Simply awful DVD remastered or not,"Although the description says it was remastered in 2008 it is simplythe worst b&w; DVD out there. Lines everywhere and in everydirection, artifacts, you cannot distinguished where the faceends and the background begins. Everyone blends into nothingness.How can this company (A2Zcds.com) allow themselves to marketsuch garbage. Will never buy anything from them again.Roy Szanik"
1,Wonderful film but poor DVD quality,"I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of ""Meet John Doe"". The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [...]"
1,"Poor quality DVD, but like the movie!","I expected a lot more in quality in this DVD after reading the Amazon description. Picture dark (had to turn contrast and brightness way up to watch), sound not level (had to turn up and down during movie), lines on picture like in an old film (which could be made better nowadays). I taped this from the TV once and it turned out much better (brighter, hardly any lines in picture, better sound).Like the movie though. Someone has to make a better version of this. I would like to see a color version with it."
5,Meet Frank Capra,"I simply adore this movie about hard working people striving to do the right thing.Don't freak out but there is no cussing, and God is even subtly mentioned. They don't make movies like this anymore....but I wish they did!"
3,good translation of the timeless elitist classic....,....which I read with both admiration at the questions Plato asks and revulsion at his answers. He is in some ways the philosophical father of elitist tyrannies and the originator of the argument that the masses ought to be hoodwinked for their own good.
2,Has great insight for philosophy but...,Tends to be very circular in reasoning. I had a hard time understanding most of what was being said. I believe that there are better books in the PHIL department.You decide
4,The Rhetoric,"Most people know this book by title, not by content. I must admit reading this book is not for the faint at heart. Rhetorics will be thrown in your face as if it is common language and some sense of historical background on the Greeks may help as well.But this shouldn't hold you back from reading this classic piece, all 450 pages of it. It is not so much the result of all thinking, but the process of thinking itself which makes this a great book. Known as one of the greatest Greek philosiphers of all-time you can get a taste of his way of thinking and the time he was living in.If you have any interest in history and philosophy you'll love this book."
5,Required reading,"An excellent look at the positives and (many) negatives associated with an elitist dictatorial society. Ironically, while many argue that Plato was calling for just such a utopia, a strong argument can be made that Plato was in fact pointing out the weakenesses with just such a creation. Plato's allegory of the cave is, perhaps, the most eye opening part of the text."
2,"A gallant, but blindly flawed attempt at sound philosophy","In this work of Plato, the author greatly strives to define justice. He tries to put forth what would be a perfect society. The problem with Plato is that he left Jehovah, the true God, out of his philosophy. Jehovah is the center of everything, and without Him, there is no truth. Since Plato rejected belief in the true God, and whole, intact truth is only found in that true God, Plato's philosophy is understandably flawed. Of course, as THE REPUBLIC is a popularly recongnized classic, one may find it useful to read it, in order to understand the viewpoint of the masses who accept it, provided one compares it with the truth of God's word, the Bible."
5,Excellent edition,"This is my first Plato piece, and I am exceptionally happy I chose Penguin Classics. The introduction it provides is quite helpful in laying a base line for someone such as myself, who having never read Plato before was able to benefit by the insights. With no knowledge on Plato, my only interest are to expound upon how great Penguin Editions does with their books."
1,Another Kindle Disaster,"For God's sake, Amazon, don't you ever look at Kindle products before putting them for sale? The words in this Kindle edition are run together. From now on, I will rate all Kindle disasters as one star."
5,The book that got me started on philosophy,"I got this book as a gift when I was thirteen or so. Desmond Lee's translation, while not the most scholarly, is very accessible. The content of the book itself is interesting and has been extremely influential-- even if you don't think of yourself as a ""Platonist,"" the book is valuable in tracing the history of both classical and Western thought."
4,Excellent resource for the classroom!,"I've used this book in my 7th grade Middle Ages project with great success. The images in the book are literally jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but not too hard for students to use in making larger ""windows."" The paper is heavy-duty, can be easly removed from the book and taped to an overhead for tracing. They should last a long time. The only ""problems"" are that the pictures aren't numbered so matching them to the source list at the back of the book is tricky - I just number them myself before cutting out. Also, I would have liked to see a sturdier cover for the pages. Once cut out, they tend to get bent. If you want kids to work on research with a project to enhance their papers, this is a good source or if you have kids whose main focus is on a project, this book is invaluable."
4,Good handbook for everyone,"When I was in Slovakia this summer, I really wanted to learn Slovak language. Thus ""Slovak for you"" was the first handbook I found in a bookstore. The content of it is satisfying for me. The book includes many dialogues taken from usual life in Slovakia. It has also wide comments on grammatical topics. Of course, there are books which focus mainly on it. But the book by Bohmerova is good enough for every beginner - speaker of English (not only as a mother tongue)."
4,Excellent for tourists or beginners,"I lived in Slovakia for two years, during which I had to pick up the language mostly by myself. When I discovered this book partway into the second year I was delighted. It is excellent for any English speaker, easy to understand and very to follow. The only drawback is for missionaries and diplomats - those who are MOVING to the country. By the time you get to the chapters on grocery shopping and going to the post office you might have died of starvation! Skip to these right away and don't be afraid to take the book with you into stores. Have a good time!"
4,Slovak for You,"_Slovak for You_ shows grammatical usage and the Slovakian vocabulary. I would prefer a chart detailing declension and conjugation of Slovakian words. There's a handwriting sample, for ex. the ""t's"" and ""z's."" This book is one of the better Slovakian books that I've seen."
4,Slovak,"good book for beginners- used in Slovakia itself. It would help if you know another Slavic language(as I do- Russian)to know the cases,etc. Book did not come with tapes in my mailing. Otherwise very good"
4,Good knives,"These were bought for a ~35 y/o Rockwell/Delta 8"" long bed jointer (37-315) to replace original knives that had been sharpened down to nearly nothing. While they are nominally the correct size one was a very tight fit in its slot and this added an unwelcome level of difficulty to the installation (sharp edges creep me out!). Whether the slot or the knife was the source of the inaccuracy I can't say. Nevertheless, they were eventually installed satisfactorily and, with about an hour of use already, they work fine - nice clean surfaces. 3 stars for the installation, 5 stars for the surfaces."
3,"Nicely detailed, Interesting reading",This book focuses on the Hungarian discrimination against the Romanians in Transylvania from the Middle Ages until World War II. Told from the Romanian point of view. Not much about the Transylvanian Saxons who were the third largest group to reside in Transylvania. Interesting reading. You will learn alot about this region.
1,Falsification of History,"The book is a very sad example how an author can misinterpret historical facts. It is unique in a sense that it was written by a non-Romanian (?) but still author's view is perfectly matching with the nationalistic view of the Romanian historians. The book plays a close attention how the Hungarian repressed the Romanians in the middle age, although nationalism did not existed until the french revolution (XIX century). Beside that between the fifteenth and the early nineteenth centuries Transylvania was ruled by either the Ottoman or by the Hasburgs indirectly.The book almost disregards the Saxons (German ethnic group) who played also an important role in history of Transylvania, but after the second world war they were fully expelled from the country. Since such a fact can be quite awkward for Romanians they simply disregard them from history."
1,"Not a review, but a question.","Why is there a picture of the classic Aviator debut from 1979 on this page, when ALL the reviews are clearly referring to a completely different band? Were the reviews here before the picture? How or why would someone add a picture from an unrelated artist to what was obviously a review page for a different band? I don't know the band that these reviewers are referring to, but they're obviously fans who enjoyed the album. The album that is pictured is the original Aviator, which was a spin-off from Manfred Mann's Earth Band. It featured ex-MMEB vocalist/guitarist Mick Rogers and ex-Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker. This page could certainly confuse people, because I almost ordered a CD here thinking it was the Aviator with Mick Rogers. Thankfully I read the reviews first!"
1,Please don't write any more books!,"This read like a book report from a 5th grader. No new real information, things you can find in any nutritionally oriented book. It's a vague story about what supposedly worked for this guy."
1,useless crap,"20% of Hashimoto's patients go into remission - it's an auto-immune disease, like lupus or MS, so some lucky people can do nothing or do totally stupid things, and still get ""cured"". This means that the experiences of one person who got better are anything but proof that what he did will make *you* better. You'll do much better to look at books by Mary Shoman or Ridha Arem."
1,Expensive pamphlet,"About half of the page count of this book are blank pages you are supposed to keep a diary with, as if photocopiers didn't exist. The rest of the ""book"" (i.e. about 35 pages) is 90% background story, and there is one page with a bulleted list outlining some seemingly shot-in-the-dark steps he took to get over his Hashimotos, which I'm not convinced he did completely.All in all, this has less information than the two page pamphlet I got from my endo's office. Two things I do agree with from the book are 1) Primary care physicians on the whole have no idea how to treat hashimoto's and 2) Managing hashimoto's does not require drugs in many cases.If this were a long blog post it would have been more accessible and more useful."
1,not what I was hoping for,"Ok ..I read all the reviews, good and bad and bought the book anyway. After reading his book I don't know if this guy actually had Hashimoto's syndrome. Anyway, he does give some food for thought in the direction of diet,etc. and what to add and to avoid. Since he doesn't give much in the way of sources to prove or support his claims of why his life style changes will work, I'm a bit skeptical of his claims. Still.. like many of us who would like to get off synthroid, I thought, ok .. I'll give it a shot.I have to agree with the other reviewers who criticized him for not giving dosage amounts for the suppliments etc., and for the 'diary pages'. The number of pages listed for the actual writing IS misleading. Don't waste your money buying this, browse it in the book store first. If you think it's of value to you after actually seeing it, then get it."
1,How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism,"This book is amateur stuff...clearly written by a non-professional. The book includes the supplements Dirgo took, but not the dosages of each. This is critical. I followed the regime for over 3 months at doses recommended by an ""expert"" in supplements at a health food store.Three months later, I still had Hashimoto's, I was just hundreds of dollars poorer for it. Who knows if it will work or not if you don't tell readers what dosages to take. I realize he is not a doctor, but he could still have provided more detail about his own treatment. He claims that he will respond to e-mails. My e-mails asking for this information were never responded to. Don't waste your money or get your hopes up with this book! The book is mostly blank pages anyway!"
1,Really bad book,"I don't know who wrote the 5 star reviews of this book, but they're like those actors in bad TV ads claiming that they lost 100 pounds in 8 weeks. Those rave reviews are hard to stomach. This is a really bad book--I agree with the person who said that they would give it zero stars if they could (half the book IS empty blank pages for your journaling). There is not much that's helpful in this book. Much better and thorough are (1) The Thyroid Solution by Ridha Arem, (2) Living with Autoimmune Disease by Mary J. Shomon, & (3)Thyroid Power by Richard L. Shames and Marilee Halo Shames. These books are better researched and are compassionately and well-written by M.D.'s and/or persons with personal experience with thyroid problems. Skip this book by Dirgo."
2,Disappointed in the lack of content.,This small book (120 pages)has 40 pages of content and 80 blank pages to record your personal history. The author's personal history and lab results are included and offer little in substantive advice on managing the illness.
1,Not Much Info Here,"This ""book"" is 30 pages of general information about Hashimoto's, and a couple of vague pages on diet, all of which is easily available on the web.The poor writing, lack of content, and the 80 pages of worksheets in the back of the ""book"" were disappointing.This information should be published as a pamphlet, not a book. Don't waste your money here, just Google ""hashimotos."""
1,How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism,"I felt totally ripped-off by this book. Over half of it is blank with 59 pages of space for the reader to record her or his personal health diary. We get advice such as eating some health foods and supplements, drinking lots of pure water, exercise, sleeping and managing stress. Duh. One of the worst problems with Hashimoto's Disease is the alternation between over-production under-production of the thyroid hormone until the devastating health results until the disease finally settles into under-production of the hormone. I found no mention of this in Dirgo's book. If there was, I didn't see it before I tossed the book into the garbage. In doing so, I noticed that it is a thinly disguised self-published book from iUniverse.com."
5,These little babies are great!,"I bought a set of these to use for mise-en-place, to hold small amounts of herbs & spices when prepping for cooking. They turned out to be such a great deal I'm going to order a 2nd set. Each one holds exactly 2 tablespoons, they're made of very nice porcelain, and because of the lipped edge they stack very tidily. (And I suppose if you were a fancy cook, you could use them to create tiny individual souffles to accompany desserts or meat dishes.)A very handy cooking tool!"
4,$7.99 so everyone can get a taste,For all the mini sweets like souffles and flans that no one wants to finish.
1,this is good,Paquito D'rivera and Arturo sandoval are very very good musicians they play every song in this album with incredible taste and emotion.I reommend this album
5,Very Good Resource Book,"This is an excellant resource book for graphic artists, designers, textile designers, illustrators, - anyone in the arts field. But the extra kick with this book is that it gives youinformation on the background and history of the Adinkra symbology and even shows you how to make stamps so you can make and design your own fabric!"
5,The Best Adinkra Design Book,"This is a superlative book on Adinkra taxtile design. The techniques and the history of Adinkra are explained in detail, ans a general history of the Ashanti and Ghana is also provided. The symbolism and historical derivation of many Adinkra symbols are explained. This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in this textile art, from textile designers and creative artists, to individuals who are exploring their Ashanti roots, to persons who have an interest in the culture that developed this spiritual art form. My only wish is that it could have been longer and included a greater number of the more than 200 Adinkra symbols; however, the basic ones are covered in detail."
3,Hard to walk in!,"These shoes are cute, but the heel is almost 4 inches! For me, they are very hard to walk in and the strap won't stay on my heel. Always slides off. I bought these for a wedding I'm in, but I don't believe I'll be wearing them any other time."
4,Powerful performances,"Jessica Biel (Larita) gives a powerful performance in this film as an eccentric American woman stuck in a marriage in traditional England. Colin Firth plays an ex-soldier stuck in a loveless marriage. The film is pretty believable in terms of its depiction of early 20th century English life. It's interesting to see how the vivacious American and disgruntled Brit get along so well.Larita's personality, hidden past, and sex appeal rub her in-laws the wrong way as she represents everything they are not. The film eventually becomes a test of love, with some interesting twists. The ""immoral"" one may be the one with the deepest understanding of love. I won't spoil the ending, but ""Easy Virtue"" has a few unexpected twists."
5,"Yes, I love Pfeiffer","If you do not see this movie for the charming and disturbing story, you should see it for the costumes she wears. Amazing and beautiful. Pfeiffer is stunning!"
3,"American Heinie: hardworking, competent but not spectacularly enjoyable nor entertaining","I thought superfit Jessica Biel was paired with Colin Firth and watching the movie, I don't think I'm wrong. But they still don't look or sound like they belong together. Jessica Biel looks too fit to be depressed and lonely enough to need anyone. She sounds like she's advising her sorority sisters and she looks as appropriate as a an American Chinese in a Wong Kar Wai movie. Noel Coward really hates the costs imposed on the English way of life and the lives stolen by the warmongers of The Great War and that seethes behind all the drollery and so what does it matter that Kristin Scott Thomas is worn and weary and her daughters aren't tarted out in the latest fashions; shiny money and an American passport doesn't transform the outsider from desirable to lovable. Noel Coward's songs are wonderful though and deserve to be passed on to our children."
2,You need a broad sense of humor....very broad,"There is a definite challenge in bringing a stage play to the screen, In this particular case the challenge was not met.The characters are not very likeable and quite difficult to relate to. No fault to the ensemble cast. They did their job with as much vigor as the screenplay had to offer them.It's boring. It's not that funny. Even the dog is not very amusing.There have been many period pieces brought to film that successfully deliver and accomplish the British upper and lower class mentality.This is not one of them.It's cold, disconcerting, and not very satisfying.But, once again, a great cast capable of much more."
2,Easy Virtue,"I went to see this movie and wanted to like it, the problem is it's just not that good. It did not transition well from the stage, and I respect Noel Coward very much. Don't bother wasting any of your money on this DVD. Jessica Biel did look fantastic. I almost walked out of the theatre, but was on a date. It was a waste of time!"
2,not my type of movie,The disc was in the advertised condition. I watched the movie but I did not like it. It is not my kind of movie.
4,review of East Virtue,Liked the look of the era and glad Jesssica wound up with Colin Firth. The music was fasacinating. Interesting to see how the faux aristocracy operated
3,wonderful cast but very dark story,I hoped for the witty Noel Coward to whom I am more accustomed. Not at all witty. HATE what happens to the dog. Hate seeing Kristin Scott Thomas play the bitch. The children are really awful. Jessica Biel's character is less-than-sympathetic. Still adore Colin Firth who manages to be the only one for whom I cared in the end.
5,Easy Virtue movie is terrific,"This movie is witty and fun. Actors did a superlative job in this caper. Loved the music, staging and stars."
5,Easy Virtue,All you have to do is write down Jessica Biel and Colin Firth and you know this movie is great. You feel the discomfort Jessica Biel feels throughout the whole movie and watch her take every slur and action against her by her mother-in-law and her husbands family. You keep watching and waiting for the main character to do SOMETHING to defend herself. Colin Firth is funny and crazy and witty and marvelous in this part. You have got to get this movie...just to see how it ends. It is great. You will never figure out the ending before it happens. I loved it.
3,"Not Wallace's Best, But Still Amusing","These short stories featuring the unassuming and nerdy J G Reeder are in the vein of better stories featuring Sherlock Holmes, Father Brown, and The Thinking Machine. Each is nicely, if predictably, plotted, and the writing is sometimes fun, but they don't have the narrative snap of Wallace's better work. So: if you like vintage mystery short stories, you may appreciate these, but read some GK Chesterton, AC Doyle and Jacques Futrelle first...."
3,An irritatingly successful detective,"A shabby, weak-faced middle-aged man strikes terror in the hearts of criminals. J.G. Reeder, the self confessed ""man-with-a-criminal-mind"" is most irritating to a reader in the sense that his success is almost guaranteed! Sometimes you feel a little bit sorry for the criminals...Twisting, thrilling, but nonetheless, a little disappointing. J.G. Reeder (in the service of the Public Prosecutor's Office) is not one who will capture the imagination of most detective fiction fans."
3,Skewed IQ Scale,"This is a comment on MENSA: CHALLENGE YOUR IQ by Harold Gale and Carolyn Skitt. As a psychologist who has administered thousands of IQ tests, I was intrigued (and disappointed) by the skewed nature of the IQ distribution used in this book. The standard deviation of most commercial IQ tests is 15. Thus, an IQ of 130 is two standard deviations above the mean, which falls at the 98th percentile and qualifies the examinee for membership in Mensa. The IQ scale used in CHALLENGE YOUR IQ is grossly inflated. The standard deviation appears to be 24! Thus, a person who scores 115 on a commerical IQ test would get an equivalent IQ of 124 in this book. This is a whopping difference and is bound to make readers think they are far smarter than is actually the case."
5,two words-Buy it,"The problem with most IQ like books is that they either are too easy{to sort of boost your ego] or teach irrelevent suff.This book is one of the best of these kinds of books.made by Mensa, and is keeping to every thing you need to boost your IQ"
4,Not Bad,"This is an interesting collection of IQ tests. Mensa tends to put out a lot of repetitive material, but this set of tests is different. My only complaint is that the tests within the set are very similar. As to the complaint that the scores are inflated, in my version of this book, the percentiles are mentioned next to each score, with the 98th percentile highlighted, meaning it would be a qualifying score for Mensa. Therefore, there should be no confusion about your performance. Even the complaint that a standard deviation of 24 is not valid isn't a good one. Some tests have such a standard deviation, including the Catell scales, a commonly used IQ test."
5,Perfect for those new to Buddhism & their families!,"Venerable Thubten Chodron is a wonderful writer - she explains things simply and sometimes humorously, and always holds the reader's interest. If you are beginning to practice Buddhism or are contemplating doing so, this book is a great place to start. It is the perfect book to give to friends or family members who are not familiar with Buddhism but want to understand your newfound spirituality."
4,Simple and informative,"Although it is a bit repetitive at times, it strives to really make the important points come across.It's clear and informative and it anticipates most of the natural questions that arise."
4,Good for beginners.,I just started reading the book and it is a good read. I breaks down what Buddhism is for anyone just getting into spirituality or someone who just wants more information.
3,Alright book,I'm agnostic and this religions a joke but I like to explore other religions to see what there about and this book a was an alright read.
4,I don't like to have to give so much detail in my reviews and would prefer to be able to just give the item a star rating and be,I don't like to have to give so much detail in my reviews and would prefer to be able to just give the item a star rating and be done with it.
1,A Terrible Introduction for those new to Buddhism,"This is a really bad place to start for those new to Buddhism. The title should have been ""Tibetan Buddhism for Beginners."" There is so much emphasis on the very mystical, literal interpretation of reincarnation that is specific to the Tibetan tradition, and this is not a good way to start. Details such as ""it takes 4 minutes for the transmigration of the soul... I don't know why, but it just does"" (not a literal quote, but she basically says this), is really ridiculous.A better place to start would be ""What the Buddha Taught"" by Walpola Rahula or ""What Makes you Not a Buddhist"" by Jamyang Khyentse."
5,Deep but Easy to Understand,"This is a great book for beginners interested in the basics of Buddhism. After reading this book I have a better understanding and a greater appreciation of Buddas and Buddism. The logic, spirituality, peace, compassion and kindness to your fellow person and yourself that Buddhism promotes is wonderful. ""Om Mani Padme Hum""."
3,Doesn't cover the full range of Buddhist Traditions,"While this book does provide an overview of all Buddhist traditions, it clearly has a Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana) bent.I was hoping for a book that gave all traditions equal treatment thus allowing me to pick the tradition that suited me best.This book simply isn't that.As such, the title is misleading (it should be called ""Tibetan Buddhism for Beginners"") and the fact that the content doesn't really cover the other traditions in much detail."
5,Great Book!,This is by far one of my favorite books. I learned so much about this religion and I thoroughly enjoyed it! A must read for anyone interested in becoming Buddhist or just wanting to learn more about the religion.
4,Good book,"I will agree with some of the others; this is a great book if you're vaguely familiar with some of the concepts. If you've never heard anything about buddhism except the name, this may not be the best place to start. What it did for me was to clarify some of the concepts I had read about in other books that those authors did not elaborate on, either for lack of room or their belief you already understood the concepts. I did find this to be a fascinating read. Some of it in other ways gets repeated in other books on the subject to varying degrees, but this is a bit more simplified. Well worth the read."
5,SIMPLY AMAZING!,"EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE!!! Perfect for the beginners. I love this book so much. Common Sense and works in our daily lives, I don't see how EVERYONE should not become Dharma. I am proud to be reading this book, if someone asks me at the gym what am I reading I proudly show them. Many want to know if this is how I am so calm being a military wife (husband always gone), 4 kids (little ones) and always so positive. I tell them, it does help :) The calm state and meditation does help. I strive to always stay positive throughout my days and not complain about LIFE. I am a changed woman because of this book and I would read it OVER AND OVER AGAIN!"
4,Interesting,"I really like the ""Q & A"" layout of the book. I was looking for a book to explain Buddhism simply. While this book is easy to read and informative, I am now looking for a book that gives definitions and how to pronounce some words. I would recommend this book for anyone who has general questions about Buddhism."
3,Great book so far....,"I am not finished reading this book yet, but I can say that it is easy reading and gives me very basic understanding about Buddhism. I must admit I got to read the same chapters two times to try to understand everything. But it's a good book and don't put me to sleep when I read it. If you want to find somewhere to start, this is the book for you."
4,NONE,I haven't had time to look the book over. It is a gift for someone else who is interested in Buddhism.
3,bud for beginners,"interesting, written in plane english very basic overview of buddhism not preachy at all just some insight on the subject."
2,Dry!,"The book is very dry. I find the topic of religion and Buddhism specifically very interesting, but the book is so very very dry that I couldn't even make it all the way through."
2,"O.K.,But Tiresome","i purchased this c.d.after i heard the song ""Thank You,Jesus"".that song is good.for the rest of the tracks,it sounds to me that he is trying to sound like the old blues greats of the past.he tried to hard.the songs just sound forced.the musicianship is good.sorry,jr.,you are NOT a bluesman.listened to the c.d. twice.haven't listened since.not worth the price they are asking. at best,it's O.K."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.,I bought this book to try understand how I could help a friend of mine out with her crack addiction. Instead of finding out any information on helping her I got a book listing the 12 steps in any 12 step program.There is virtually NO INFORMATION ABOUT COCAINE OR CRACK and the information in the book can be gotten freely from an addiction anonymous program.A much better book is Cocaine Solutions: help for Cocaine Abusers and their Families.
1,Don't buy ANYTHING by Philip Schlechty...,"This is no different from ANYTHING this man has put out for public perusal. I've also WASTED money on the so-called WOW book because I'm a teacher. WHAT A WASTE!!! It should be criminal for anyone to make the kind of money this man is making by bilking vulnerable people and school systems with a pile of technical verbiage, that, when all is said and done, amount to little more than the ""fluff"" another evaluator attests to, and the same regurgitated common-sense knowledge anyone could have received from just about any basic source. It is MY opinion that this man is a charlatan who has made millions bilking individuals and by exploiting school systems with this type of drivel."
4,Hardy cookware,"Very sturdy product and demonstrates the durability and service ability of porcelain which, one assumes, has been around since the late George Burns.This customer does not do quiche, but product was obtained for baking at high heat. Heat is spread evenly and quickly. Finish on dish cleans easily.Cannot beat price so two were purchased.Only worry is that since the dish is made in old China, one hopes it does not contain lead!"
4,cute earrings....,The color is WAY lighter (and brighter)than the picture..but they are cute and well made.
4,Very Pretty!,"The ear rings are very pretty, albeit the stones are a few shades lighter than the picture shown in the products catalog. Shipping was prompt and packaging good."
3,Really poor battery life!,I use these radios daily and have no problem with them whatsoever except that the batteries die after five hours or so. I need them for work and can never get through a shift with the rechargeables. They work great with regular batteries though.
3,Good but not 15miles..,I could get a clear 15mile range on it. But I got 2miles for sure.Battery got exhausted very fast and charging is taking too much time.
3,Two-Way Radio,"I like these two-way radios, they have good sound and range, but they eat up batteries.To be honest I haven't used them to often because they do require that the batteries be change often."
1,Big waste of money,These two-way radios are a waste of money. The battery life is too short to get much use out of them. They're going to Goodwill and I'm shopping for something better quality. I can't believe Uniden put their name on such a bad product.
2,"Nice radio, terrible battery life","The batteries take 12-16 hours to charge, and drain out in less than an hour. I am sorry I bought these, what a joke!"
4,"A lot of bang for the buck, but not perfect.","I am still trying to find the ultimate closed-ear, in-ear headphone for under $100. These are nice and breathy, but don't have the bass response you'd hope for in an in-ear phone. Also, the super thick cords produce a lot of noise if you're moving. Over all, they're a lot of bang for the buck... but if you were to compare them to Grado SR60's, they might as well be Coby. I know, that's 2 completely different styles of phones, but... not too far off in the price department. When I eventually find those in-ear's I spoke of earlier, I'll let you know."
4,Amazing ...when they work,"My first pair of these came with a strange static in the left ear bud, but amazon replaced them quickly, and since then I've fallen in love. These earphones easily compare to those in the 100-150 dollar range. I love how clearly and accurately they reproduce sound even at the highest of volumes, and give just the right bass and midrange. All i can say is give them a try, the build quality is a little suspect but all in all they are a great pair of earphones."
3,Just ok,"I was in the market for a set of headphones and these looked like they would fit the bill. At home I use Grado SR80's which I love, but they are bulky to travel with and after a couple of hours they feel uncomfortable. I got these and they looked pretty good. I didn't like that the wire right near the headphones was super stiff. The fit in my ear was ok. I started listening to music and was disappointed. The mids and highs sounded pretty good, but the bass was basically below 100hz. These don't sound better than the cheapie phones you get with an iPod. The only advantage these have over those phones is that since these are in ear phones, they do muffle some of the outside sounds. It's too bad as I had high hopes for these."
2,Great sound while it lasted,The first pair that arrived had damage to the wiring in the left speaker.They were quickly replaced with a set that lasted for four mouths until the problem came back.This time the area of concern being the wiring at the base of the plug. Too bad. The sound was great while it lasted.Also the last pair of AltecLansings I'll ever purchase.
4,Legitament goods and bads,I will start this review with simply the goods then the bads.Goods1.Real good sound quality.2.Once you have them in they stay in.3.Durable made of good material.4.Multiple tips you can use for your ears.5.Extremely good sound canceling.6.Long wire for all uses.7.After warming it up once again the sound quality is great.8.Flexible wire close to the headphone so you can easily twist it a way and it stays there for as long as you want.Bads1.Takes a bit of time to set it up to fit your ear.2.The speakers tend to not have as much bass as i wanted but sure do have alot more than apple earphones when you get them in your ear.As you can tell the goods to bads or bads to goods is 1 to 4 or 4 to 1.I recommend this product as the best in ear headphones you will find on Amazon.
1,"amazing if you enjoy poor listening quality, losing the left side, and annoying wrap around design.","I followed the break-in suggestions given by the mustached fellow with too much time on his hands, unfortunately; the earphones are still horrible months after. Actually they are amazing if you enjoy poor listening quality, losing the left side, and annoying wrap around design. Anyhow, I really hope you think twice before wasting your money.........."
3,Bass???,It has a wonderful high and voice clarity. But for bass lovers kindly avoid this. You will be disappointed. Comfort level is not that good.
2,Great until they break.,"I'm a web/graphic designer and multi-media person, and somewhat of an audiophile. Audio quality was amazing, until the right piece broke apart. Yes, they were getting about an hour's usage a day at the gym - but these are static items (once secured in your ear), so I'm sure how it even fell apart.Again, wonderful while they work. They really knock out outside sound when you purchase additional foam ear buds, but then - they break. They did last a little over year before this happened, but I expect something this expensive should last at least 7-9 years."
2,Over rated headphones -,"I purchased the earbuds based on the reviews. While the price is attractive, the sound is tinny and lacks depth and richness. I tried to break in the earbuds as others have suggested, but heard little improvement in the sound. I think the issue is fit. While there are 4 different ear attachments included with the package, none of the them fully block the ambient sound which affects the base level.Though I paid $40, if the headphones are not fully usable it's $40 too much. I see the price fluctuated from $35 to $100, I would avoid the headphones if it's over $40. Not worth the investment and I would look elsewhere."
2,great sound but won't stay in ears,Anytime you move at all wearing these headphones they fall or pull out of your ears...I don't know if it is the unusually stiff wire that the company used or the odd angle of the earphones design but I found them impossible to actually use...I went through all the different ear fittings that were furnished to no avail...I had some small success by stealing the fittings from another unused brand of headphones....don't get me wrong...these headphones sound great...just don't expect to actually do anything but lie down and listen with them.
1,Fell apart,"I bought these a few weeks after they became available here. I got only 3 or 4 uses out of them before the wire came out of the left side, and I had taken the greatest care not to put any stress on any part of them. I should have asked for my money back but instead I threw them away and made a mental note to not buy anything branded with the name Altec Lansing."
2,".WARNING, WILL ROBINSON, WARNING!!","Lots of flailing arms!WARNING WARNING WILL ROBINSON!!!I have decided these headphones are pretty lame. They do get better but they are so bad when new, you wish yourself into believing they will get better. But they really don't.Save your real money and buy something that actually sound good, not something you hope will get better.I should say that these are good for audio books because of good noise isolation and comfort for my ears but your out of luck if you decide to listen to music, so why bother?"
5,Altec Lansing vs. Ultimate Ears,"I have recently purchased the Altec Lansing inEar headphones to replace my beloved pair of Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 headphones. I loved my UE headphones and used them for everything. However they only lasted for a year before the earbud separated from the wire. I particularly liked the wrap around the ear cord that kept the earbuds in my ears when I was running. They were almost identical to the Altec Lansings that I recently purchased but they seem to have corrected the earbud separation from the wire issue that I had (I hope). Both sound very good to my untrained ear. I have flown extensively with the UE which do a fairly good job at blocking out the screaming baby that always sits next to me. I read several reviews that discuss the lack of bass. I was pleased with the amount of bass but do not listen to heavy bass music. Overall, I can't tell much of a difference other than the cost (I think I purchased the UE on Amazon for $168). SAME HEADPHONES! Enjoy."
2,"Great sound, broke after 3 months :(","These earbuds sound fantastic. The problem is that they broke after about 3 months. The weak point is the area where the wire meets the earbud. This is the where you are able to separate the wire from the bud to replace the main wire incase of failure. This area broke and the small wire from inside the bud came out leaving the bud dangling, was not able to fix. They are not very comfortable either. The wire that wraps around the top of your ears hurts for awhile and they are not very comfortable in the ear even with the proper sized rubber pieces. Maybe this is why they are $40 now instead of $130. My advice, for what it is worth is look for something else."
1,Dead on arrival,Dead on arrival. No sound in the left earbud. Tried on several devices.Disappointed.
1,"Please find as many synonyms for ""awful"" as you can",Save your money and hire a guy to just yell at you. It would probably be more enjoyable than buying these.
2,Broken soon after arrival.,"The sound quality is good; the bass is clean and not boomy. Unfortunately, one of the earpieces fell apart within a week of their being delivered--the fourth time I used them. I cannot recommend them."
3,Mislabeled L R???,I just got these but cant figure them out. Ive tried to instal them in the appropriate ear as identified on the headphone and they just dont fit.Trying them in opposite ears they sorta fit better. Has anyone else noticed this?Thanks!
2,In the ear of the beholder (listener). . .,"Sound and sound quality are very subjective. I found these earphones solid and well-built. However, to my ear the sound is a bit ""tinny"" and thin without the rich bass I have gotten with other earphones. I listen to classical and some vocal. I was disappointed in the quality. It improves somewhat with volume--but there is a limit to this.To another, perhaps more educated ear, these may be just the thing. I am putting them away and going back to my JLab ear buds."
5,Excellent headphones for the money,"I've had these headphones for about a month and I love them. The sound is excellent and you can hear so many things that you normally wouldn't be able to hear with the cheaper $20 earphones. The Altec Lansings come with an eartips kit with several different eartip sizes so you can (hopefully) find the eartips that fit your ear canal to give you the optimal sound. One of the provided eartips did that for me and I was in sound heaven.I seem to be getting better sound listening to music through my laptop compared to my iPod. I find turning the ""Sound Check"" option off on the iPod helped, but I think it's ultimately up to the recording. You will definitely hear a difference between a 4 MB MP3 recording at 192 kbps vs. an Apple Lossless file at 12 MB.I got mine on sale from amazon.com at $39.99 USD which was a STEAL, even with shipping, currency conversion to CAD, and brokerage fees.. I see it's going for around $70 now but I say it's still worth the money."
2,"Good sound, great fit, but broke after 2 weeks","it was always too hard for me to find in-ear headphones that fit perfectly. this pair was great in terms of the fit and comfort. i jogged and exercised in them for a couple of weeks with no problem. however, the right ear bud broke after only two weeks. will try to return."
2,Terrible customer support,"I had to return this product to Altec Lansing due to a minor defect. So far it's been a month and I still don't have my earphones. The worst of it is that they lie about when they'll be sending a replacement. My three customer service calls have all yielded the same assurance that a replacement will be sent immediately. They said the same thing today. I've rarely come across such terrible customer service and despite the excellent audio quality of these earphones, I will never purchase another product from Altec Lansing."
1,Bass is missing,"As per most of the reviews. The Bass is missing from these earphones. I you don't like base at all; then these earphones are made for you. I tried to ""Break in"" the earphones as was mentioned in the video review. But no luck with the bass. It will never come out.Beside that the ergonomics is pretty bad. You wont like the kind of fit these have on your ear. The earphone extends out of your ear and hardly fits in position when you are moving."
1,Terrible,"I hardly ever write reviews, but it was that bad.The sound quality is good for the price and just what I was looking for. That is the only plus. The cord is rigid so it holds the form if you wrap them around an ipod. Folding the cord around your ear is annoying and after 9 month of adjustments, still was unable to get them to sit comfortably.I use them causally at my desk and working out a couple times a week, and the right ear piece already severed off because of the metal used to form the shape to your ear. The buds them selves are borderline painful to get used to. And once you do, good luck getting them to stay put in your ear.$50 should last longer than 9 months."
1,Altec uph336,They do not sound any better than the cheap ones I had and the cheap ones are much more comfortable. I am very disappointed with these.
2,Sounds great but breaks like clockwork,"I'm going on my fourth pair of Altec Lansing UHP336 earbuds. To the point: they sound great but break in about a year...yup all four of them. So you should be asking yourself how good is their warranty (1 year) and do I want to put up with the hassle of returning them if they break within the warranty period? For 40 bucks, I think it's a fair deal. Too bad they can't build the electrical connections to last - they sound great while operable.Altec Lansing UHP336 Snugfit In-ear Earphone"
2,Wires break,"For the money, I have found nothing that comes close to these in sound quality. (They are exactly the same as a pricier Ultimate Ears set, BTW, just re-branded.) I found a way to get comfortable with them, by making my own foam tips. But the problem remains, THEY BREAK. Either the wires break at the connection to the ear piece or the connector itself comes unglued - and THEN the wires break. It is impossible to repair with a soldiering iron, because the wires are tiny, and they get lost in the sealed earpiece cavity.I have bought two replacement sets, both times thinking I could make it work if I were just a little more careful. I won't be getting a fourth set."
2,Are You Kidding??,"These Earphones are so complicated to put on your ear. It takes me at least 1-2 minutes to wrap these wires around my ear properly/comfortably so it wouldn't get loose in my ear. Most of the times I avoid the hassle and let it dangle just like regular earphones (but they fall out easily). There is absolutely NO BASS at all but the treble and the clarity is pretty decent. I listen to a lot of hip hop so I'm very disappointed by the lack of bass on these earphones. I got them for $20 so I'm not going to bother returning it, if it was more than that I definitely would."
1,worse than original apple earphones,Very dissapointed with these. No bass... Not comfortable. Not good value even at the $30 price!
1,Not Durable - Don't Waste your money,"When I accidentally order two pair of these i thought that i would have at least one of them around for a long time. First pair destroyed when i had them in the outside pocket of my computer bag; the ear piece completely disconnected from the cord. I didn't think that it was too awful and was partially my fault. But, now that the second pair has done the same thing with absolutely no abuse, I think that the manufacturing quality must be terrible.I would not reccomend these to anyone. Sound is good, not great, but they wont function long.Stay away!"
4,good sound quality at low cost,"Altec Lansing UHP 336 headphones are the best price with the best quality, fits my need for work.I recommend it."
2,"Comfortable, but has Zero Bass","I know sound is subjective, but these do not sound good. They are okay for audiobooks but music sounds shrill and lacks richness. Even the default ipod headphones that are sold with the player are superior in sound.But they are more comfortable than any buds I've tried."
4,Good earbuds for the price,"If these can be had for $40 or under, they're a really good deal.The construction and durability is pretty weak, but unlike the last couple of reviews that had problems getting them replaced, I've had no problems at all. I purchased in April 2009 and I've had them replaced 2x with no problems at all.The sound quality for the price (I paid $40 in April 2009) is great. *These buds need to be broken in* Plug your ipod in and let it run at low volume for a few hours or more. You will not get the bass quality right off the bat if you just stick them in and crank it.Fit quality is good, not great. I use the foam, and they're version is just ""alright"". There are other foam tip you can buy that may be a better fit for your ear. Foam is the best way to go for isolation and comfort, imo.Don't let the bad reviews fool you. There are so many earbuds that are just awful and these are a great value for the money ($40)."
2,Lasted Only 3 Months,"I paid $80 for headphones that I could use for 3 months. I essentially paid $27 per month for these headphones. They have been falling apart for weeks, the wires are exposed because the shoddy plastic encasing has fallen apart, simply from normal use. Even at the lower price, I expect something that costs $80 to last for more than 12 weeks."
1,Not for heavy use,"If you plan on using these everyday and use them often, I do not suggest purchasing these. They do not fit quite right, which caused me to constantly fiddle with it and eventually the earbud fell off. I heard they were detatchable, but these just straight up broke off, nothing was getting it back on. Poor quality and the sound quality really wasn't that impressive."
1,Not durable...Broke in a month!,"When I first got these, I loved them. Sound was good. When used with my Shure orange foam inserts, the noise cancellation was as good as my $300.+ Bose over-the-ear headphones.But, after very light use (3x a week at the gym for 4 weeks), and storing them in the padded case that comes with them, the wire broke in two at the connection to the earbud itself. Too much money to pay for a month of light use. Don't waste your money."
1,Where's the bass?,"Did my research and settled on these based on the recommendations and price point of <$50. The over-the-ear fit was also very attractive. Neither of these attributes can make up for what I perceive as a total lack of deep rich bass sound that I was hoping for. I have tried all of the different plugs and while the foam inserts are best, the base sound they provide still do not compare to the standard iPod earphones. While the sound is clear, there is no depth and certainly no bass even when listening to reggae and HIP-HOP jams."
1,left earpiece broke in half,"Sound quality is great after breaking them in. but after few uses, the earpiece broke in 2. I didn't abuse them and they were sitting in my gym bag. It seems each earpiece is assembled by connecting 2 pieces. Whatever holds them together doesn't hold up."
1,Bulky and lack bass,"I wanted to like these earbuds, after all, they were only half off for a Gold Box Deal, but ultimately, their lack of bass really killed it for me.I tried leaving them playing for maybe 6-8 hours to see if the ""burn-in"" might help, but I didn't really notice any difference. Changing the buds themselves seems to help a little bit; I went from the tri-flange silicone attachment to the single, rubbery bulb. After doing this, I noticed that there was more of an ""ear-plug"" feel, which made them less comfortable. After doing this, the bass went from a 0.3 out of 10 to a 1.0 out of 10.So in my opinion, totally not worth it, I'll gladly stick to my default Zune earbuds.Oh, but the highs and mids did sound nice, I will admit. But bass is equally important to me, so I'm giving these a 1 out of 5."
5,Get The Foam,If you are looking to step up on a set of Earbuds the Altec Lansing UHP336 are just something else. Get the T-500 Foam Earbuds for the right fit the first time!!! Man for comfort and Sound Quality They will blow you away. If you user only the Snugfit you may find a Really horrible lack of Bass but with the Foam Earbud tips you will go to heaven with a Great bass response and a Treble that will hurt you. Midrange is Quite good. I have Headphones Koss Portapro and Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B Noise Canceling and other Earbuds but These are in a Different Class. I'm not sure any Music could be harmed with this set of Earbuds. I'm Going to Burn them in for a another 24 Hours But they are Impressive after the first 24 hours!!!!
2,Durable but really uncomfortable,"Summary- go for another set of earbudsI bought these for work, so have only used them sitting at a desk connected to a laptopPros:- Sound quality is fine (not amazing, but not bad either)- Cords are very durableCons:- Extremely uncomfortable- They don't stay in my ears (and I've tried every size)- The cords are really stiff causing them to stick out awkwardly and get in the way"
2,Keeping getting more uncomfortable,"I got these last summer, and have used them on and off since then. The noise isolation is pretty good, but I still find the earpieces some of the most uncomfortable of the many different earbuds I've owned over the years. The sound quality is only decent, even after breaking them in as suggested. Other ear buds in this price range sound much better to my ears (these produce a pretty accurate sound, but it doesn't sound as full as other headphones), but they all broke more quickly.In short, decent sound, seems durable, not much fun to wear for long periods of time."
4,"Clear sound, not much bass","I bought the Altec Lansing UHP336 In-ears after reading the reviews about them. They are nice quality, with thick cords and many sizes of ear covers. I am using them as in-ear monitors for playing piano for worship. I think the sound is clear, but can't say the bass is the best. I'm guessing I don't have a lot of bass coming through my mix, but when I used them just with my mp3 player I still didn't get as much bass as I like. All in all I think they were well worth the price and I am glad I purchased them."
2,a joke,"i have owned the bose in ear headphones and they are amazing. These on the other hand are absolutely junk, there is no bass at all. whoever reviewed these to be comparable to $140 headphones sold is telling you B.S. do not purchase these if your looking for a quality headphone because these are not them. Nothing but treble no bass...........(not worth the money) and yes i realized its only $50 but you could put that in your tank!!! and get more out of it !!!"
1,They broke.,"These broke when i tried to remove the cord :( it ripped the wiring out. Im going to call Altec but i doubt theyll do anyting, what a waste of $50. I never even got to listen to them."
3,Un upgrade if a minor one,"Just a warning to buyers the bass is less than you might expect. Also you really have to shove them in good to get the bass. That said they do have a pretty good frequency response, maybe a slight upper midrange boost. Defiantly an upgrade over the iPod buds."
2,Not as expected,"These earphone whe purchase to replace the original than come with the Sansa Fuze but their sound is not as impressive as I expected. It doesn't have much bass and the sound is not really crisp. In addition, they have an unconfortablle in-ear fit."
2,Not recommanded,"Do NOT buy it. First, it is not comfortable. It makes your ears suffocated. I am OK with the base. But there is annoying static noise in the background. Also you can hear your moves and breath clearly. Not worth the money even with the huge discount. Get something else..."
1,Uncomfortable and annoying,"I am very surprised at these other reviews - I relied on them and bought these phones, but was immediately disappointed.1. I am not at all impressed with the sound quality and believe I can get similar performance with $10 or $20. This price is just not worth it for this sound.2. Unless I jam them in my ear, the bass is non-existent.3. They constantly work themselves out of my ear and sometimes completely fall out. The the ""fit kit"" included in the package is worthless.I regret not trying these out before buying and am very disappointed in myself for spending this much on what I thought would be a good pair of earphones. Beware."
3,Don't let the design fool you.,"First off let me say that these sound great!!The problem is that they are extremely awkward to use. I have yet to get them to fit in the ear AND around the ear. They suffer from, what I would call, a design flaw. I finally straightened the kink that is built in and use them straight in. It worked for me but I was a little worried because it is a molded arc. If you like great sound AND a challenge then get them. Otherwise, save yourself the hassle."
3,Good sound but lousy wires,"I use these at the gym. They work best with the foam ear buds that come with the product. Sound quality is pretty good but the wires are too stiff and break easily. One pair already died on me due to broken wire. Despite the lousy wires I re-purchased the item, but will be more careful with the delicate wires in the future."
2,Very little bass,"I thought this would be a great bargain but I am disappointed with the sound quality. I've always bought in-ear monitors, and out of 8 different sets I have owned, this one has the least bass. The highs and mids are clean, but the bottom end is missing entirely. I have let them play at high volume for several days to see if that would improve the sound (as suggested by other reviews), but it did not. I used the several different types of ear pieces included, and I have also tried using ear pieces from other headphones. Still the bottom end of the sound spectrum is missing.I cannot recommend these.I ended up getting Klipsch S4 and am very happy with the sound quality."
2,Broke,"These headphones sounded great while they lasted, which was only about a week. One day I put them in and one side was just dead. The stiff wire was pretty cumbersome too. The little cylindrical plastic inside foam ear tip that came with the headphones fell apart immediately. I purchased a nice set of foam ear tips that made the headphones sound a lot nicer for the short time they worked. I now know the reason for the steep discount on this item.On a different note I just received my Razer Protone m-100 in ear headphones and they sound phenomenal. Same price range and way better sound. Here's to hoping they have a better lifespan than the item on this page.Good luck."
2,Not the most durable headphones,"I was really excited about these headphones. They were the first real upgrade from whatever I picked up in the drug store or already came with my iPod. I used them daily for working out, listening to lectures, or just listening to music walking to and from class. However, after a month the leads disconnected from the right ear bud. I was expecting a little more in the durability department. That said, the sound was fantastic, the noise cancellation effect was perfect, and they were quite comfortable."
3,Odd fit creates questionable sound,These do not fit as comfortably as I would like - the right piece won't stay in my ear no matter which cover I put on it. The left piece fits fine. Since only one side fits the resulting sound is awkward and too much outside noise infiltrates the set.
2,"Maybe I was unlucky, but . . .","This is my 2nd pair of Altec Lansing UHP336, and these will be returned for a complete refund. On both of my pairs, the glue holding parts of the cable to components like the y-split and headphone housing is very faulty, resulting in exposed wire and general unhappiness for everyone involved. As for the actual sound of these headphones? These are worth every penny. These headphones surpass everything I've owned in the past, including the famed Koss KSC-75. Having only $40 from this refund, I'll definitely be sacrificing sound quality for proper build quality.I'm listening to these right now, staring at this precarious exposed wire, wishing these did not have to go back. Everything about this headphone is amazing. Fit, comfort, sound quality(the bass even opened up in the first 10 hours of listening.. That, or I just got used to it), but the build quality makes me not want to take another chance on these."
3,Pretty good,"Pretty good. A bit overwhelmed, and distracted, with the many subplots. I felt it deviated from interesting characters. Although it showcased the hysteria and social critique, it was frustrating to lose connections to characters. Interesting style though and worth an effort to read."
2,An Icy Cold Novel,"Egolf indeed has talent, and tells a seemless story with a rare combination of skill and rawness, but like most aspiring writers, he's afraid to really write with emotion. I found this book to be only a good story. I was desperately wanting to see him expose more of the characters hearts, and feelings. Although this book is creative and interesting, and is written in a style that is fresh in today's fiction, I was constantly wishing that he wouldn't have made it so cold."
5,Best book I've read in YEARS,"I truly can't remember the last time I read such a wickedly good book, it's been years. The story telling ability of Egolf is staggering. What made me sick was the fact that Egolf wrote this at the ripe old age of 27. His grasp of the human condition gives the impression that he is wizened to be 3 times that age.The story is centered around a down and out poor creature named John Kaltenbrunner. Egolf masterfully weaves tale after tale of John's misfortunes and poetic justices. With Egolf's skill however, it could have been about anything at all and you would still enjoy the book on its comical merit alone. It has a few minor problems such as Egolf's unwillingness to end the story (you'll see what I mean), but the faults are few and far between. This is a dark, yet hilarious book, that definately deserves a read (or two)."
4,Comic and inventive,"The prose is thick, but the characters are laughably pathetic and the plot progresses with a manic intensity that all but sucks you in. Egolf's grasp of society's ""dregs"" is dead-on. This is a real hoot, but intelligent and crafty at the same time..... Highly recommended."
4,Steinbeck on Prozac,"I had stumbled upon this book when I had volunteered at my local library one summer. Ok, so there is no dialogue in this novel, but who says that a novel has to have it? John Kaltenbrunner is an original character. The last time I read a novel where an author had created a semi-autobiographical character was The Catcher in the Rye. This is a novel of intelligence and emotional energy. I had read his second novel Skirt and the Fiddle and while it was not his best work, I know that he can write. Even if he never writes another novel, this is sure to be a cult classic."
5,Simply Wonderful,Best book I have read in years. Hilarious. I could not put itdown. I have since lent the book several friends.
5,Want to delve into the cornbelt?,"Simply put: Read this book. It will have you laughing, it will amaze you, and you will think again about that outcast in grade school you made fun of. The main character is someone who you want to run away from but at the same time you wish you could be like him."
4,A Contemproary Masterpice!,"I have just finished reading this work for a second time. I honestly hope that at the end of this century, Lord of the Barnyard will be recognized as a canidate for the 100 Best Novels of the 21st Century. I have not much else to say. The readers of my review should look to the other positive reviews on this novel for the evidence of its greatness. Anyone who thinks this book is anything less must consider the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books as serious works of literature.Agree? Disagree? Reach me at fearandloathing20@hotmail.com"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought 2 sets of blades from Powertec and this set here from freud thinking the c400 would be a performance upgrade boy was I wrong the powertec blades were not only 10 times sharper out of the box they are outlasting the Freud blades by a mile I should have sent them back out of the box,they were dull out of the box nothing here has been pre honed ."
1,Poor product,"Hi, My son bought a box of 6-inch Freud jointer knives (item C350) for a weekend project. We installed them and they cut more poorly than the dull ones we replaced. They were not sharp, one edge was rolled, one edge had a valley in it. One knife was bowed. Just a mess. Took them to a sharpening shop today and owner said he would do his best to correct them. We were very disappointed to receive what amounts to bar stock with a bevel."
3,Replace Craftsman Jointer Knives,"I ordered the Freud C400 6-1/8-by-11/16-by-1/8-Inch Jointer Knives as a replacement for my 1950s era Craftsman Jointer. They arrived promptly and in excellent condition.I had a little difficulty in installing them due to the fact that they were actually 6-3/16 inches long instead of the advertised 6-1/8. Other dimensions were accurate. I was able to install them and they are performing satisfactorily, however the extra length does not allow any freedom in installation which will shorten their life by not allowing me to shift position slightly when the inevitable nicks occur.I will try another manufacturer next time with the hope that they will be closer to the advertised dimensions."
4,Good Blades for a Good Price,These blades were for Ridgid Jointer. I got them quicker from Amazon than I could at the Big Box Store I bought the jointer. They are good steel and sharp. It is almost as cheap to buy new blades as it is to sharpen your old one.
3,They're okay,"I bought these jointer knives for my Ridgid joiner (jointer, whatever). They are less expensive than the Ridgid knives from Home Depot--which HD does not stock, BTW. They fit perfectly. The knives cut harder woods very well, but they leave a lot of tearout on softer woods. Maybe its me or my setup as the other reviews are v.positive, but that's my experience. Possibly my sharpening guy can put a better angle on it or something."
4,"Fun,Hip and Cool","I loved the movie and the music, so i bought the soundtrack. In it theirs lots of great techno,rock and of course funny dialogue.Oasis with ... in the bushes was amazing, as well as Klints Diamond and Huey Smiths ""dont you just know it"". I promis you'll love it especially for people who love techno,dance and rock this ones for you all."
4,Missing one good song,"Excellent soundtrack, but it's missing one great song that was part of the movie, ""Cool"" by Samia Farah. Check it out sometime, it's a cool drink in the heat of summer. We all need that after a little bloodletting."
2,Below Par,"Snatch is a great movie like it's predecessor Lock, Stock...but the soundtrack just doesn't give you the same hit as the Lock soundtrack. The songs are OK but not good enough for repeated plays - disappointing after the lock soundtrack."
5,I don't know Tommy.....it's tip-top,"I love this movie. I didn't even know what it was till I rented it...they didn't have enemy at the gates, so I chose this. I just couldn't stop watching the movie. It's pretty funny. It might be a little hard to understand because of the english accents but still it's a solid movie. Good from start to finish. Must have! I went and bought the night after I saw it!!!"
4,"""Sneet das d""","Yes, ""Snatch this CD."" If you saw the movie and was wondering about the music, its here and it rocked my world."
5,Among the top ten CDs in my collection,"This album has easily made it into the top ten spots of my 800+ CD collection. It contains the most eclectic blend of music I've heard in quite a while. I guess the other album that comes to mind is ""Pulp Fiction"" - no wonder Guy Ritchie is being considered the successor of Quentin Tarantino's movie-making style, where music plays a key role.Musically, the tracks ""Diamond"", ""Golden Brown"", ""Hot Pants"" and... basically the entire album, get you in the Snatch-groove even if you haven't yet seen the movie.To make the soundtrack even better, four excerpts from lines taken from the movie are included, among them one by un-understandable Brad Pitt and another from Dennis Farina (""I'm coming to London!"")Believe me: this one's worth having!"
4,A steal,"This has been a good year for soundtracks. First ""Oh Brother..."", now Snatch. A great soundtrack should not carry the movie, but the mood, and the eclectic, shall I say, whimsical, nature of this collection really brings out the scenes. Even as one listens to the soundtrack alone after seeing the flick, details of the relevant scenes pop up. There is an incredible amount of energy here, and there has to be, to keep up with the disjointed, parallel-plotted movie. This soundtrack has the feel of a road-trip mix made by a friend of diverse musical tastes."
3,Locked DVD player unfixable for International film buffs,"Its a great labtop with many good features and a good price but one major flaw is this:The DVD player cannot play DVD's from other regions. You get to pick one region when you first play a DVD and can change it only 4 times before it locks PERMANENTLY.That means if you pick a DVD region that you don't normally use for the last time it is locked forever to that region and nothing you can do will change it. The region encoding is directly hardwired into the DVD hardware and VLC or MAcripper cannot get around it. Currently no firmware updates are available for the DVD player.This is extremely annoying for those who enjoy watching their legally purchased DVD from different regions. This feature alone makes the macbook much less ""portable"" at least in an international sense."
5,Excellent Mac as expected,"I needed a portable Mac and this is my first one. For the price paid I'm very happy with it. It's elegant, fast and reliable."
5,Grand and Awesome,The macbook is my wonderful possesion. I am loving the beauty and the simplicity of the macbook and OSX.
1,Everyone who gives it 5 stars... just wait!,"Both me and my wife bought Macbooks at the same time and have encountered NUMEROUS mechanical problems with both.I've sent my computer in twice, for problems, the second time I got a completely new computer but still have to put up with problems. My wife has sent hers in twice as well.We are totally sick of the hours we have wasted with their customer support pretending that the issues we are experiencing are something they've never heard of when their are websites dedicated to these Macbook problems.So after spending a lot of money on the laptops we've finally come to accept our keyboards occasionally not working, trouble waking from sleep, but just recently both our screens have started flickering... I've just got to endure loosing my computer again to apple to fix... Once my warranty runs out I know I've as good as lost this computer.I loved Mac but after all this all I can say is do yourself a favor and avoid this laptop."
3,Like buying a used car,"When I first got this thing, it was amazing. Then after a month, it began shutting down randomly. I brought it in to have it fixed. Took about 5 days before I got it back. About 3 weeks later, the screen had weird horizontal lines. I brought it back in; it was back in about a day. Then came the Superdrive failure, the hard drive failure, and currently, the superdrive won't eject a software CD I put it in. It makes me nervous when something I bought new seems to behave like something at the end of its rope. I grew up with Macs and will always prefer the look and ease of use of both the hardware and software, but I'm starting to think these Macbooks are like those cheap foreign cars that feel great at first, but you're probably only going to get about 50k miles out of it."
2,"My first Mac laptop, and a poor experience","I got a good first impression, but it went downhill from there. I really wanted to believe that kid from ""Jeepers Creepers"" in the Apple ads that this computer didn't crash, but it seemed flakier than any Windows box I've used recently.The Pros:- boots fast. Sleeps/Recovers well. Wireless works weellThe Cons:- Slower than I expected- I found the UI to be baffling, coming from the Windows world- I've had it crash. Mac doesn't exactly blue-screen. You get a message saying ""you need to reboot"". But it's the same thing- Frustrated that a lot of apps I was used to weren't available for the Mac- Occasionally, the screen would get ""scrambled"" and I would need to move windows around to refresh it- Battery life wasn't as good as I hoped. My Sony TX does *much* better."
1,I bought it and it worked only for the first 5 minutes,"I bought my Apple MacBook through amazon. It worked for the first five mintutes - then it had to shut down and never came back to life. ""Friendly"" apple technical support told me that yes my computer is defective and i should send it back to amazon. so now i am going through a huge hassle of returning the item"
5,"Love, love love this computer","Faster than any of my previous Mac's, which are all still in use after years of service (with never any problems). Boots up super fast, decent on battery usage. The only thing I would change is the magnetic power cord which doesn't really stay in well. I love the built in video/camera that's new too for me. The airport (wi-fi) has great new connect/ network diagnostic tools. I have had this about 5 months and truly love it."
3,Mac laptops have poor keyboards,"My old G4 laptop duplicated letters (llike thiis), but my new white MacBook skips letters (lke thi). I a a normal hunt-and-peck typist. Really, really annoying. (See how ""am"" came out?) Don't believe me; check it out for yourself."
4,Harry Nilsson-Greatest Hits,Had a craving for Nilsson and was pleased to have my craving satisfied by this fab CD at a great price.What a small price to pay for memories and good music. Rock on Nilsson fans and Amazon!
4,good,This is a good compilation of the Harry Nilsson songs I was looking for. So that's all I have to say about that.
3,Some greatest hits,It's missing the best songs from Schmilsson unfortunately. Too bad would have been great to have everything on one handy disc.
5,Great C.D.,"This is the best Nilsson collection, becaause it is the only collection of Nilsson with the song ""Girlfriend"", a tune that became a theme song for The Courtship of Eddie's Father."
3,Harry Nilsson - Greatest Hits,I thought I knew this guy but most of the songs I don't recall ever hearing.
1,Nilsson,"Disappointing CD. I remembered the tunes from the late 60s and early 70s. I should have left those memories back there. This is, upon review, a sappy collection of ""B"" side records. Other than the ""Puppy Song"", which has been featured from time to time in adds and video productions, the music was just disappointing. Leave those beer mellowed memories where they belong...in the recycle bin.G.G."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"I thought I'd give this recording a go after recognizing a few titles and reading a few reviews.For me, though, the CD has been a great disappointment. Lightweight, silly and trite, most songs seem juvenile lyrically and facile musically. Obviously he spoke/speaks to a large number of people, but I guess I'm just not one of them."
5,COLLAGE DISCOVERY WORKSHOP-CLAUDINE HELLMUTH,"I ordered my copy of this book from the prepublication site. I have anticipated the arrival of it and was thrilled when my copy arrived. I have read and reread the pages and am more than excited at the instructions within.Rarely do you find an artist of Claudine's talent who is willing to generously share the knowledge of her particular craft and tell us her secrets. She has done exactly that. The book is written in excellent step-by-step concise and very understandable instruction with complete lists of what is needed in order to achieve the looks for the collages. All of the items needed are easily obtainable, not items that are impossible to find, most at our local craft and art supply stores. This is the very best workbook on collage I have had the priveledge to read. I can hardly wait to try every single technique."
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE.,Collage Discovery WorkshopThis book is not worth the price. It is very limited in information. It kept my attention for about two minutes and then I put it on the shelf. I doubt I will use it much for a reference. I will give it to my ten year old niece.
3,Thanks!,"Book was in great conditon, but I purchased the book for a project and by the time it came... we were done with the project."
5,Easy and Concise,"I am very pleased with this book purchase. From the very beginning of the book, the project instructions are well written and very easy to follow. Lots of good information on working with various mediums. Claudine Hellmuth has done an excellent job helping readers learn collage art."
4,Well worthwhile...,"I have been searching for any and every book to guide and inspire my interest in altered book making. I don't own this book yet, but I borrowed it from my library. Inspire me it did! I can't wait to get my own! The book provides very clear instructions how-to photographs,as well as composition exercises. The only reason I felt this book was four out of five stars was because I wish it were longer than its 126 pages! Anyone who may doubt the value of this book should get their hands on a copy before writing a pessimistic review. Thank you, Claudine, for a fine book."
3,collage,"while this did provide some usefull info. i didn't find that it was my style, was expecting more and maybe more detail about how to's on college and maybe some different techniques on working with other subject matter. this work is kind of dull in color and and i am more into vibrancy. although i did flip through some of the pages before ordering it i was expecting more from what i had viewed. will be searching for another book about college that suits my style."
3,What about spell check,Collage Discovery WorkshopI like the book which I have on my Kindle but there are so many spelling errors. It makes what is a good book seem amateurish and second rate. Such a pity. Most errors would be easily fixed with a simple spell check on the computer. Maybe with the next edition?
5,Best book I have ever read,"This is a very well-written and inspiring book. I felt like Claudine was in the room with me, walking me through each project, I could SEE clearly everything she explained. I love project-books and this is the best I have ever read. She uses everyday items, you don't have to buy anything special to make these projects. I highly recommend this book! Can't wait for the next one!!"
5,Collage Artist,"I loved this book. It gives basic techniques and ideas that make a collage more interesting. I read it cover to cover and have already started incorporating some of the information into my own work. It taught me about how to keep my collages from ""floating"" and to actually have a better sense of the work I am doing. I now know that I don't have to have a white background to fill in when I am doing a collage.I would recommend this book to all beginning collage artists and even those who have been doing work for awhile to stretch their craft in a new direction. Claudine Hellmuth is a master at teaching the art of collage and I am really impressed by how easy she makes this medium seem."
3,TRICKY!,I bought this stroller for my daughter's 6th birthday. I chose it because she is tall and wanted something she wouldn't be hunched over pushing. It is definitely her size and after more than 6 months of frequent play it is still in good shaped. The one drawback is that the metal supports collapse alot and this frustrates us both. I've tried taping them without success. I will take another's advice and try hot gluing them next.
2,Baby Pram,"This item is okay. The ""Lay down"" stroller does not stay on the base that well. My daughter gets frustrated but she still loves to use the stroller. You can take that part off and use the base as a sit up stroller, and the Pram part as a bed. I would not buy this one again."
2,On the market for a new doll carriage,"OK, so this carriage is not bad for the price but after less than 2 years the removable bassinet no longer stays in place to the point my daughter just can't use the carriage, and in general it is pretty flimsy. I am currently out on Amazon looking for a new pram to give my daughter for Christmas. That having been said, I like the fact it is navy and my daughter did have fun with it. If you are looking for a stroller that is going to last, however, this is not the one to buy. If you want one to get you through a year or so (while you determine if your child is truly going to play with a carriage)then this might be a good option.I will give Badger Baskets a thumbs up however in the customer service department. I recall our first bassinet piece had some flaw when we initially purchased it and they replaced it right away. I didn't have to send anything back. It was a completely painless process."
5,3-in-1 pram,"My daughter LOVES this pram! She has been playing with it daily. I would recommend buying this for anyone who wants a ""classic"" looking pram."
3,decent toy,"This stroller is very cute,but...the second day a piece broke off. My daughter still uses it seperately as a carrier & a stroller."
2,"It's okay for a few laughs, but that's about it.","If you're into cute little songs with corny lyrics, than the Danielson Family is for you. Other than that, don't bother. Most of the songs are based on acoustic guitars, and all of them feature hilariously squeaky voices. I liked ""Rubbernecker"" and ""Pottymouth"" the best, but they stick in my head until I'm sick of them. They're nothing more than a novelty band at best. They are most appropriate at three o'clock in the morning when I've had waaaay too much Mountain Dew."
2,Not impressed,I am a fan of the books and was excited to see it coming to life...I really didn't like it. Hated the cast. Totally not was I envisioned. I know most of the time storylines change but I was really disappointed.
1,OK,ok now you dont want to see this movie if you have not read all the books because its a combination of them all and its not how you may have planned.
3,The decline of the Forsytes,"Here's my take (with a small spoiler) on the Forsytes, after finishing ""The Flowering Wilderness"", the eighth in the series: The first six books are excellent and well worth reading but the next two, with the central character of the first six absent, seem to lack purpose. They're well-written and enjoyable but I don't see the point. This is particularly true of ""The Flowering Wilderness"", which (to the modern reader) is full of extreme reactions to a minor incident."
4,Good price for a hard to find book,"I sought out the book through Amazon as it was hard to buy locally. I was given the choice of several suppliers. The book arrived moderately quickly and was in an acceptable condition, not'as new' but obviously second hand. This didn't detract from my enjoyment of the novel."
1,Where is it?,"Ordered on May 5, 2003. It's now June 4, 2003. Only information available is ""not shipped yet"". If the item in fact is not available, let the buyer know so that the buyer has the opportunit to contact other suppliers."
2,These knives do not fit Delta 4 inch jointer.,"I do not know where I got the idea that these knives were compatible with Delta 4 inch jointers, but they simply do not fit into the head. They are to thick."
5,Milk Tea,Its the best kind of stuff. I get this at my favorite Vietnamese restaurant and now i can make it myself.
3,Thought it would taste more like honey,"Adds a great taste to your tea. I used them with blooming tea I purchased & it adds a good flavor, a little sweeter, but really tastes nothing like honey, more like chrysanthemum flavor"
1,"Nothing New, Nothing In Depth, Nothing Worthwhile","I thought this was going to be a good book for creating business class Cross-Browser DHTML Web Applications. IT'S NOT.Apparently, the target audience for this book was the weekend web-hobbiests who want cute interactive graphics for thier homepages.This book is not worth the paper it is written on."
5,Unforgettable,"Creed and Jassy's story was so amazing and beautiful! She made up her mind that he was the man for her and never lost faith in that, even when things seemed to be at their worst. Creed was a tough and hardened criminal who was determined not to lead Jassy into his rough life until he realized what he would be throwing away: his heart and soul. What a such a passionate story! I felt their pain and happiness, and even at times, laughter. I must congragulate Ms. Baker on another unforgettable book!!"
5,River is amazing.,I do not understand how any one could give this wonderfully gripping movie less than five stars. I mean how could ever give that wonderful bed scene with River and Keanu a poor rating. That is like heaven on earth. That is the light in a world of darkness. The only thing that might be considered a problem with this movie is the ending. I personally wanted Scott to pick Mickey up at the end and say he was sorry he left for a an annoying Italian girl and a father who was a jerk. Who could ever leave that beautiful man?
2,Very Overrated&average,aside from River Phoenix there's nothing interesting here.this film had a chance to be interesting but then went downhill into nothing clips.Keanu Reeves still can't act.Gus Van Sant has done far better material than this before&after.
5,My Own Private Idaho-Criterion Colletion,"The item was sent in a very timely manner, was packaged very well, and I was very happy with it upon opening it. Thank you very much, everything was top-notch!I'm sorry it has taken me so long to review.~SS*"
3,Disturbing & Intriguing,"The movie is a weird, bizarrely contemorary take on Prince Hal & Falstaff. Fascinating & Off-putting! My copy arrived with a DVD case that looked like it barely survived the Flood and without the accompanying booklet. I was not too happy!"
3,Interesting treatment and adorable Phoenix,"Albeit a great premise, something seems to go awfully awry when the film turns from the quest of Phoenix' mother into a Shakespearean interlude. [Gus, what were you thinking....?] Phoenix gives an all-out performance as the hustler with-a-heart-of-gold. Keanu Reeves is believable and often uncomfortable with the part, especially the sexuality which remains tantalizingly oblique. Don't miss the scene around the campire; it is heartwarming. The dialogue, the gay hustler angle and the starkness of the situation make this film limited in its appeal. Having said that, the attempt at depicting the grittiness and the abandonement runaways experience is one of the best."
5,Mesmerizing ...,"This is an extraordinary film -- extremely ambitious, challenging, and deeply moving. The performance by River Phoenix is among the finest in the history of cinema."
3,Not that great,I thought River Phoenix did a very good job acting. Keanu Reeves was his usual terrible self. I didn't like the direction in this movie. At one point they're in one location and a second later they're in Italy. Then there's this crazy man named Bob who makes no sense and yet he takes up 10% of the film. The scene where Phoenix is cleaning the man's apartment is disturbing and lasts too long.
1,Don't waste your time,I couldn't MAKE myself sit through this movie. It was sick and depraved. I have no idea why River Phoenix is hailed as such a great actor with as little talent as was displayed in this film.
4,Absolutely Dreamy,"As a friend of a narcoleptic, I found this movie to be a sensitive treatment of the disorder. More than that, I found the soundtrack, especially the steel guitar accompaynment played during the naroleptic episodes, to almost cast a spell on the listener. Pity this soundtrack never was issued. Does anybody know where one might find a CD of the artist who performed those pieces? If you do, contact me a GJMPond@aol.com"
3,weird,my own private idaho is a slice of the lifes of hustlers mike waters-river phoenix and scott favour-keanu reeves..its a love story between 2 male prostitutes...very intence/adult
1,This book was a big dissapointment.,"The Druid Way had nothing to do with traditional Druidism with the exception of the historical sites visited within the book. This is my first book that I have read by Carr-Gomm, and it will be my last. The book is filled with too much Psyco-psychology. By reading this Book I find that Carr-Gomm is overly obcessed with Sexuality. If one wishes to follow the tennents of Wicca, then this is a good book. If you want to read about traditional Druidism, stay clear of this book."
3,Enjoyable casual reading style is excellent,"Although Scott, and the editors, exhibit a syle that is excellent for the novice readers, sometimes the technical side is a bit needy. Figures 1-2 and 1-3 blew our entire class away. The point should have been made with /20 as the subnet mask for third octet host id's in the range of 8+4+2+1(i.e., one through fifteen in third octet).Proof through positive example is better than negative non-working examples on the first time through. Additionally, any reader of ""Managing IP Networks"" who takes the time to read the appendix probably would not be confused in to thinking ""twisted pair"" is maybe not ""copper"". All in all, excellent reading for the networking student."
3,Good intro to what it the cover states,"I enjoyed the content of this book. I must stress that it is an intro to networking with Tcp/IP. It is rather vague in details on quite a few subjects in the CISCO arena. I was a little dissapointed with it's delivery of IP subnetting. I was looking for more of a detailed description relating down to the binary or hexadecimal values. Overall, I think it is a good book to start off with and to gather the terminologies from. It does give brief descriptions of many of these but doesn't exert details with many. If you are the person looking for an intro into CISCO routers dealing with an IP point of view, this book is for you."
2,Lily of France Value In Style Convertible Strapless,"Not the best! Immediately putting this on it felt waay too small. I've always had the problem with strapless bras that they squish my breasts in to the point of flatness, with bulge coming out of the top- and this bra is no different for that. No adjustment to fix this either, and it's not cute or flattering *with* the straps either. I love Lily of France x-bras a lot so I was disappointed. I may order the strapless convertible x-bra, hopefully that one allows more *room*...we'll see!"
3,Fits Small,"Yes, this bra fits SMALL......I got it for a girl who would normally wear a 32A and with this bra she fits a 32A. The cups have good coverage. I don't really like the sheerness to the band or shininess of the fabric. Also I don't like the fancy little double spaghetti strap."
1,korean import sadly heavely censored,Do not buy the korean import it is heavely censored. It does not show any pubic areas of which there are many scenes & it is a long movie dull movie with the censorship.
2,Severly Censored,"This movie may be ""unrated & uncut"" but the ""Korean"" copy I received was heavily censored with annoying censor-blurs.Too bad... was an otherwise enjoyable flick."
5,psychiatry class,This film is about a woman with borderline personality disorder and his boyfriend Zorg
2,"some good f...king shots, but, come ON!","Okay. This was recommended to me by my boss at Fine Line. She was courting the director, and she said I had to see this movie he did. She was right and she was wrong.Yes, the guy (Jean Jacques Beniex) is a very talented visual director - there were a number of shots that really impressed me, and the lighting was great. But the story grew to be so ridiculous and unexplained - mainly Betty's ""craziness"" - that I lost almost all interest and actually found myself fast forwarding it to the very end, which was, as I'd feared, ludicrous. At least to me, my old boss apparently loved it.Would I recommend it? Jesus I don't know. I mean, I'm glad I watched it because I'm a director and I learned a little, will take a few things away, but for anyone who's NOT interested in breaking down shots and looking to be continually visualy engaged, I would say on.C-"
2,KINDA FRENCH,YOU MUST APPRECIATE THE FRENCH FILM.I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH OF THE MOVIE AND WILL BE PASSING IT ON TO SOMEONE WHO LOVES THE STYLE.THANKS
2,TOTAL RIP OFF,"I was being generous in giving this 2 Stars. It is a highly censored rip off of a very good movie. I saw the shorter version on VHS years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Why anyone bothered to release this in this condition is beyond me, and most likely borders on, if not crosses into the territory of deceptive and misleading advertisement. It should have been clearly stated that this is the Unedited but Censored Directors Cut. I find the method of censorship to be highly distracting and it would have been better to have just cut out the scenes altogether, then you most likely would have had a very choppy movie. What a waste."
1,Beware of censorship.,"The movie is ruined by censorship with ""modesty"" blurs. Otherwise the film would be interesting. Actually prefer the original cut."
3,Great Movie - Not so Great Blu Upgrade,"One of my all time favorite foreign films which I've owned previous DVD editions both original US release and Director's cuts. This blu-ray is of the original release instead of the Director's cut which included quite a bit more material that added to the overall story and expanded more on some of the characters. My main problem with this Blu upgrade is the rather bad picture quality. It's not that it's a bad print but that it looks like it has gone through some major digital filtering which has left the picture looking very 2 dimensional and fake, reminded me of very early digital camera TV."
4,provocative french girlfriend,"Incredible nudity and sex, but a sad, intense ending. Also amazing scenery of the french countryside and good storyline and acting."
5,Beautiful film,"There's something so entrancing about this film. It takes you into its world, a world of passion and spontaneity, love and madness. Even though it's not the most brilliantly written film, it is just utterly captivating. It stayed with me for days after the first time I saw it.I saw the director's cut before I watched the original version. When I watched the much shorter original, I felt cheated of experiencing some of Betty and Zorg's life. It is still a good movie in its original form, but the director's cut seems more complete. If you can't get enough of this movie, make sure you see the long version too."
5,"Touching, Powerful","See the other reviews for plot summaries. Great film, excellent camera work, touching story line. Certainly not too graphic sexually, (perhaps a bit too much full frontal male nudity). Probably a tough movie to watch and not feel your heart sink at least a little bit."
5,This movie played in cinemas in Ireland for 15 years+,A classic French masterpiece. A fantastic score. Memorable characters. Betty Blue manages to transcend the traditional Hollywood 3-act structure very well and still pull off a fantastic piece of story-telling.
2,Why a korean stuff?,"It's the movie, good video and audio quality. It's the director's cut, as well. But... why in the product info nobody says that its features come in korean???!!! I usually purchase a dvd thinking in more than just the movie. It's really a shame!"
1,Horrible Print!!!,"Yes ""Where's That Fire"" was a lost film until discovered by the BBC in 1975. Still there is no excuse for such a horrible transfer. It appears that a 35mm print was the source material used, and the contrast is quite good. It's the transfer that is horrible. Heavy use of DVNR that makes the film unwatchable. You actually get a headache form viewing this DVD. Stay away!!"
3,Not what It appears to be....,"Although this is a good leather case, it doesn't hold your PSP safely inside. The sides are open, and if you turn your game to the side, it will fall out, which happened to mine. Luckly my game didn't break. Therefore I would not recommend this product for that reason."
4,Don't Detour around this video!,"I won't lie and say this movie was a great movie, but it was worth the money to buy it. I am not sure if this was Travolta's first film that he directed, but he did a decent job. What brought the movie together was the interesting cast. The indestructable Gary Busey, and the scene-stealing Michael Madsen alone make this movie worth watching. If you are a fan of either of these guys, you will not be disappointed."
1,"There are much, much better resources out there","I was very disappointed with this book. Alice Walker seems more intent on showcasing her own writing, poems, and emotion than drawing much needed attention to FGM in Africa. There are compelling real-life accounts of FGM--read Desert Flower or Do They Hear you When you Cry."
1,postcolonial ego soapbox,This postcolonial piece of garbage masks some very real issues. I expected far more intelligence and sensitivity from Alice Walker.
4,Great quality product!,"""Great quality product!"". I enjoy using this product with the color lip pencil that I also purchased to use with it. Unfortunately, it did not stay on my lips for a satisfactory amount of time."
4,Decent Blade,"The blades that I received were decent, however, before using them I highly recommend lapping the back side on a Japanese wet stone. The edge as received was curled over from the sharpening process and will lead to a short blade life if they are not lapped before installing."
5,good set of blades,"This is the third set of blades i have gotten.I use thgem on my 6"" Jet joiner. They work great and about half the cost of Jets. I will get them again when I need them"
3,Pretty good blade,"I use these for other than their intended purpose, so take this review with several grains of salt. I found that the blades were not entirely flat (slight cup) and were not incredibly sharp on arrival. However they sharpened up nicely and hold an edge well. They are working great now, but if you like a really sharp blade and don't want to have to sharpen or flatten it yourself to achieve that, this is not the product for you."
4,Good Knives at a Good Price,"This is a good set of jointer knives, and at a fair price. Shipping was quick. I wouldn't hesitate to get another set."
2,Ho Hum,"Chipped edges,but ok for sharpening because they're flat.Is it too much trouble to get razor sharp knives.Made in Italy!?"
4,good product good price,Like all the freud products I have purchased in the past quality is some of the best out there.
1,Must be from from the metal scrap yard,"These blades were pathetically dull when I received them. I ordered these blades to have a fresh set of razor sharp knives ready to go to work. Instead, what you receive is a set of three blades the seller picked up from the local metal scrap yard that cut nothing. Had to sharpen them myself just to get a decent result. Ridiculous!"
3,suspender?,"I don't think I'd call it a ""Suspender Bodystocking"" because the holes on the sides are really just small cut-outs. But, if that's ok with you, then it's cute."
4,All I can say is...wow,"I haven't worn these for real yet as I am waiting for that special occasion, I'm not even sure why I bought it. It just looked...interesting."
3,interesting &funny,i would like to read this book again.ihad found this book worth reading but it is not quite suitable for teenage because it is very difficult to understand
5,It's Great,"With many artists that dont interest me, I have been searching for a band who sounds good and the lyrics are written well. I've found it! I don't know if you heard the first cd but I also reccomend that one in addition."
5,"""Open up your eyes"" as well as your mind","This cd is probally one if not the best album relesed in 2002. Baseing the cd off of its singles is a very close minded way of judgeing this great band, even if you love the singles. the best songs are Politik, God Put a Smile Up on Your Face, Amsterdam, Clocks, and The Scienteist. the whole album is wonderful! if the first was this good, they would be selling out ampatheaters accross the nation, if not the world. I had the pleasure of seeing this band in Atlanta last march (i think it was March...) and i must say they became one of my most memorable concerts that i have ever seen (along with R.E.M., Audioslave, Incubus, The White Stripes, and Queens of the Stone Age.) I love this album and if you buy it, it WILL NOT come out of your cd player for a lllloooonnnngggg time....i gurentee it!""Tell me I'm your politik"""
4,Memories,"It reminds me of an old boyfriend, although it was many years ago. It has that melancholy vibe. It is really a deeper album than their last issue."
2,180G Vinyl.,"The three stars is not for the music itself. That's a five star.It's for the pressing quality of the vinyl. This album has a HUGE amount of background noise, pops and hiss, and has a muffled sound.I've sent it through my Spin Clean several times and it helped the noise a bit, but still a lot of noise on this album.I'm going to send this to a friend to have it cleaned better (VPI system) to see if that helps at all. But a brand new ""Limited Edition"" album should not be this poor fresh out of the sleeve...For the music itself, it's fantastic. A solid start to finish album. The music will bring you through just about every emotion throughout the playlist."
4,Solid pop album.,"There are really only two tracks on this LP that I dont like, 'Clocks' and 'Daylight'. The rest of the album is a very good alternative/pop album. Interesting, well written songs.My favourite tracks are Politik, Scientist and Warning Sign."
4,The best album of the year,"A Rush of the Blood to the Head is the best album of the year because all the songs are awesome especially ""In My Place"", ""The Scientist"", and ""Clocks"". Some other songs are fairly good but not as good as the songs I like. When I bought the album, I listened and became addicted to it. This CD had been in my CD player for one whole month, and I listen to it every day even when I am doing my homework. I let my friend borrow the album and she liked it also. My friend usually listens to rap/rock and she hates Coldplay. The next day she went out and bought the album. I recommend this album to anyone who likes slow and peaceful music."
2,Ehhhh....,"It's alright and semiwell-produced (i've done better in my basement). The music is soundscapish but....the words are plain dumb and this album doesn't have good replay value. It's quite the typical pop machine. If you've not heard many musics....then I think this might sound a bit better. In a world of heavy music accessibility I wonder why all these reviewers have not found anything more profound then this album to call it 'mind blowing' and 'orgasmic'. It's got some contrived 'style' but it's not deep. I, like others have found that the design of these songs are about identical. I understand the notion of the sylistic pop album that sells to the masses but man...it makes me want to drool after two listens..."
3,Simple music that grows on you.,"I really hadn't heard much of 'Coldplay' and had little interest in them until I heard their song `Clocks'. I just love that song; it just stuck in my mind so I had to get the album. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed listening to the rest of this album. The music is extremely simple; very repetitive chords, little electronics, simple yet charming vocals, and resplendent lyrics. However, though the music is conservative, the album tends to grow on you the more you listen to it. It's the perfect album for my husband and I to listen to while eating dinner and winding down at the end of the day. It's just very upbeat and relaxing. Not one of the songs has an angry, political, or dance-like tone to it, which isn't a bad thing if that's what you're in the mood for. I guess that would be my only complaint about the album; that it's almost overly safe. I would like to hear a little more emotion in their songs."
4,"Not as good as their debut, but still respectable..","After the perfection of their debut, Parachutes, it would be difficult for Coldplay to make a sophomore CD that was anywhere near as good.And in fact, this CD is not as good as their previous work, however, it's a testament to their quality as musicians that it still is an excellent venture for all involved. Any other band would kill to have this be their best CD ever. But Coldplay is so good, it's just their 2nd best.The sensitivity of Chris Martin's vocals, the amazing creativity of sound and variety of style, makes this a more than worthy follow-up for a band that has proven they are not just a 1 CD wonder.Standout tracks are the haunting ""Clocks"", the plaintive ""In My Place"" and the sweet ""Green Eyes""."
4,Much better than anticipated...,"It seemed to me that all the songs on the radio by Coldplay were slow and really seemed to focus on lyrics rather than the overall music. So the first song came out and I wasn't blown away. But when I heard ""Clocks"", something just clicked. So I listened. There are no songs that make you hit the skip button, and it's easy listening. I had one of their earlier albums, and you can see how they have progressed musically. I think that one day, this will be the album that pushed them over the top - kind of like Radiohead with ""The Bends"". It won't be their best, but it pointed them in the right direction."
5,Simply amazing...,"I first heard Coldplay when ABC featured their (quite annoying, in my opinion) song ""Yellow"" in one of their commercials. I was not too impressed until I heard their next single ""Trouble"" on the radio. I bought ""Parachutes"", but was somewhat disappointed. When ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" came out, I was tempted to pass, but fortunately I did not. There are almost no words to describe how fantastic this CD is. I don't like to think of this CD as music. I think of it as an experience. Coldplay has managed to bring their music together in such a way that it feels as if the actual composition is surrounding you. Some particular bright spots on the CD include ""The Scientist"", ""Amsterdam"", and my favorite song of all time, ""A Rush of Blood to Head"", which was featured recently on a commercial for HBO's series, ""Six Feet Under"". Actually, my advice to you, the buyer, would be to buy this CD to experience the title track. Amazing, that's all I can say about this CD."
4,Better than Parachutes in every way,"I own both Coldplay CDs and I prefer this one over Parachutes because its just simply better. I like Parachutes but I love ""Rush of Blood to the Head"". It seems to be much happier and up beat than Parachutes. Parachutes just gets a little slow and boring and sleepy. This album is great though. So many good songs. Im pretty sure the whole world is in agreement here that ""Clocks"" is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Because it is. Other great songs are ""Warning Sign"", and ""God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"". This album is a must own and so is Parachutes. But if you want the better one get A Rush of Blood to the Head."
5,Finally ... Some Real Music,"This is a wonderful album; moody, atmospheric, melodic, and, most importantly, sincere. There is something universal in the lyrics without being overtly sentimental. In terms of melody, most of the songs are penetrating and linger in the mind. Not only that, but the songs seem to go together well, so each one follows the preceding song in a kind of pattern that fits perfectly. This is an album you listen to even when the stereo is off; a classic in the making. As far as musical influences, there are many, but I hear mostly U2, Radiohead, Philip Glass, and the Beatles ... not too shabby."
4,Love this,"Slick, careful production, with really nice mixing which gives plenty of room to the bass really got me into this. The melodies grab you, Chris Martin's voice is really sexy and the lyrics are thought through. Politik, The Scientist and Clocks really stand out as tracks - especially Politik with its excellently arranged and produced haunting IVmaj-Imin cadence. Cool."
4,Really Good,"I love Coldplay. I'd rate this a 5, except for Green Eyes, and Warning Sign. Otherwise it's really good."
2,Rush of Air Supply to the Head,"If you want to give these guys credit for anything, they certainly deserve credit for taking soft rock all the way to the top again. They should be called Radioplay because they take basic elements of the Radiohead sound (not the experimentation) and set it to easy-on-the-ears melodies, beats, and lyrics. ""Lost in Love"" has nothing on this one. I'm actually eagerly anticipating the Coldplay covers album of Air Supply. ""All Out of Love"" with a brittle beat--that will really be something!"
2,Bubblegum grew up and got depressed,"Coldplay is--utterly--derivative. It certainly is not the worst pop (Coldplay is SO pop!) music ever produced, as the Music Money Machine insists that the most tiresome efforts be well produced these days, so two stars for production values. But Coldplay is simply uninspired, bland, boring, dull, simple-minded and, yes, juvenile. I can only pity the legions of fans who, raving about Coldplay, therein reveal profound lack of exposure to, now, 35 years of notably disaffected and alienated balladeering going back to, at least, as another knowledgeable reviewer noted, the great but ephemeral Tim Buckley. Need depressing music? The Smiths/Morrissey, anyone? Sigur Ros? Too challenging, I suppose. Ahh, forget it. Just go back to sleep and forget these pointless criticisms."
3,It should be 1 star but...,"I give Coldplay 3 stars because they proved to me that any band that knows how to play a couple notes over & over again and write simple lyrics can touch the hearts of so many people! As a musician this is a very comforting thought.however...I don't listen to this cd. It just doesn't have any substance. the lyrics are boaring and the music is very simple (trust me... I've red the tabs!).If you like the songs ""In My Place"" ""Clocks"" and ""The Scientist"" then by all means buy this CD. Otherwise check out Radiohead ""OK Computer""."
2,Booorrring.,"I think coldplay have succeded in writing some of the most boring, generic, and above all meaningless lyrics yet seen in rock. But I usually don't mind, as they've also written some rather good melodies. On this particular album however the music seems to have followed suit and is, with the exeption of Clocks, also rather boring. Then again, if you liked the singles, i'd suggest you buy it, as 'In My Place' shows them at about their worst."
1,A rush of blood to the winker-tinker,"Is it just me, or is the lead singer constipated while he recorded this album? puh-lease!!! How dare anybody call this worthless filth ""music!?"""
2,Vastly overrated and mundane (but will help you sleep),"Judging from the number of 5 star reviews on this page it seems like I'm a little out numbered but I do believe Coldplay must be the most overrated UK band of the last five years, closely followed by Travis. Not since Oasis has so much undeserved praise been lavished on a 'kind of OK but rather boring' band. Ok the tunes are nice enough for a while but where is the depth? For UK music try Badly Drawn Boy, Dakota Oak, Aim, Roots Manuva etc.I think Dido is ...as well."
3,not bad,"i simply think that this album is worth the buy. since i am a fan, id say its NOT BAD. but since so many people like comparing them to travis, i have to say travis is better than coldplay."
1,Like U2 on a bad day sans Edge,"Some good songwriting and tunes here, but it's hard to get past Coldplay's blatent riffoff of U2's style. They will never equal the brillance of U2, and would do much better to establish their own sound instead. The singer's outright theft of Bono's trademark style is unconvincing and rather embarrassing to say the least."
5,Following in Radiohead's footsteps,"Let me first say that this review is written from the perspective of yet another Radiohead fanatic. In another review, somebody said that AROBTTH is to Parachutes as Radiohead's OK Computer was to The Bends. I had the EXACT same sentiment when I first listened to the album straight through, and was delighted to see someone else sharing my feelings. In my opinion, this is no coincidence. THIS IS THE ALBUM THAT WILL SOLIDIFY COLDPLAY IN MUSIC HISTORY. I've always been looking for the new Radiohead (in artistry, not as a replacement, mind you!), with artists like Muse, Godspeed You Black Emperor, and Sigur Ros. With A Rush of Blood to the Head, my search is over.Long live Coldplay."
1,Boring and typical,"Coldplay's parachutes was a fantastic change to mainstream music, but the follow up was so typical. A Rush of Blood to the Head is exactly what one would expect from a millenium rock band. I disagree with people saying they ripoff pink floyd, they are far from such rock icons. This album is boring and has the most unoriginal and typical vocal melodies of a modern album, I think that I have heard this album redone 5 times. And the guy that said there hasn't been a good band out of england sense the sex pistols is missing out on the cure which are absolutely fantastic, robert smith will never let one down unlike chris martin."
1,Emotionless,"Let me preface this by saying that I am an avid music fan, with tastes in all different genres and styles and can appreciate talent and art when i hear it. I own Parachutes and while I found some songs enjoyable and engaging, it was not and is not the masterpiece everyone says it is. It was catchy, sure, but nothing amazing. Yet I was interested in seeing what else this band could offer. I saw potential for a great progression. Unfortunately, ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"" is an OVERPRODUCED, EMOTIONLESS mess. It tries way too hard to impress and to please. The songs are lifeless. They lack character and emotion. For those tagging this album as ""passionate"" and ""emotional,"" do yourself a favor and buy ""Sea Change"" by Beck for a truly emotional new album.One star and that's only for In My Place which is probably because it is so similar to Trouble."
1,One Hit in the Head,"There is but one hit song and it keeps playing in my head. Clocks is a mezmerizing tune with beautiful lyrics masterfully tuned in to the waves of euphoria which surround it. The rest of this album is drab, mundane, boring, sleeping with the fish. Coldplay has proven with one song that every band has the opportunity to produce something special. It is just too bad that they didn't apply that special something to the rest of this lackadasicle blob of plastic."
5,Excellent! Amazing! A piece of art.,"Great Cd. One of my favorite bands of all time. There music is superb. The lyrics are some of the greatest I have ever heard.Some of my Favorite Tracks are ""Clocks"", ""Amsterdam"", ""The Scientist"" and ""Warning sign"". If you are a fan of U2 or Radiohead, you will enjoy ""A Rush of Blood to the Head""."
4,Coldplay's new album - pretty good,"I would definately buy Coldplay's previous release, Parachutes, before I bought this CD. This album is good, but doesn't have the same melancholy feel that I liked so much in the first album."
4,Great Album.,Coldplay have managed to make one of the best album of 2002. Good songwriting and musicianship. The production is also good and lyrically it is more interesting then Parachutes.Many people didn't think that they were able to follow-up the 5 million selling ultra-hyped debut but they certainly did with this album and in many cases much better album it is more stabled there are no fillers etc.Unfortunately it seems that Chris Martin is getting so much attention these days that not many people would like to focus on their music and for example him being in these awful VH1 shows about most sexiest and elligable Bachelors and stuff has helped to ruin Coldplay's sucess not to mention that Chris is now the star of the band and the others are just musicians helping him out which it wasn't like before. However a good album. Well done Coldplay but don't start doing anything silly.
2,Not what I expected,"This is not what I expected for Coldplay. I heard about the band from some friends who thought they were the greatest band ever, so I went and bought the CD. Turns out that their songs are very boring and all sound the same. I wouldn't reccomend listening to them while lieing down or you may fall asleep...And that's what I wrote the first time. Now I'm kind of changing my review of the cd because the more you listen to it, the more the songs get stuck in your head. THey are slow songs, but they are still good. The best song is the Scientest."
3,A rush of sleeping pills and I need a nap.,"Coldplay, for all there critical acclaim, makes me very drowsy indeed. Pop music got really depressed one day and thus Coldplay was born.Seriously, even Robert Smith and Morrissey would listen to this and say, ""Man, this stuff makes me sad."""
2,Disappointment,"When you hear the three singles, (""In My Place"", ""Clocks"", ""The Scientist"") you expect a masterpiece. But have you ever seen a trailer for a comedy film that looked great, but was disappointing because the trailer gave away all the funny parts? Same thing with this album. The three singles are worth it though. Just skip the rest of the generic filler."
3,Yawwwnnn....,"Not a bad album, per se, but certainly not the epic album of the year. While Coldplay have some songistry talent, these tracks -- with the exception of ""God Put a Smile on Your Face"", ""Clocks"" and ""A Whisper"" -- are largely forgettable. And frankly, Chris Martin's over-yearning vocals grate on one's nerves after while. In fact, it was precisely because of ""Yellow"" off their debut album that I vowed never to give them a second listen.But as circumstance would have it, I came into my possession a copy of A Rush of Blood to the Head, and while I've heard much worse albums, I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
3,"good, but not great","besides ""politik"" and ""in my place"", no songs really stood out on this cd. i was a bit dissapointed with it, but only because i had such high expectations after listening to ""Parachutes"". it is still a good album though, and definatly worth buying."
