1,Graham Phillips unable to answer Steve Reina's challenge,I find it very interesting that Graham Phillips has been unable to answer Steve Reina's challenge as to the Book of Jasher. According to his index Phillips uses Jasher ninteen times to support his thesis as to the historical connection between the Edomites and the original mountain of Yaweh worship.
1,Good reading until you check its sources and find they're made up,"To make this short, the book is a waste of time - considering that (as other reviewers have pointed out) one of the main sources is considered a hoax (the book of Jasher...at least the one traced to Alucin). The author loses any remaining credibility when he notes that a professor from Philadelphia University, Michael Martin, studied the book and ""was convinced of its authenticity before publishing it in 1995."" I verified the claim made by other reviewers...try as you may, you can not find any evidence of such a book being published, or such an individual existing (Michael Martin of Phil. Univ.).I don't mind reading theories that make some leaps of faith or that go against conventional beliefs, but I do not appreciate authors conveniently making up sources to support their claims."
5,Miricale !!,"This is truly a wonderful product. I had a cystocele (bladder prolapse) after the birth of my second child and was utterly devastated at how restricted I felt because of the bothersome symptoms. I just want to share that after only 4 weeks of doing these exercises I have had HUGE improvements.This DVD is made by and actual physical therapist who specializes in Pelvic Floor rehab and had a grade III cystocele herself after each one of her 3 kids. It is clear,concise and packed full of helpful info. The exercises are not too difficult and I actually find them somewhat relaxing. It only takes six weeks (doing one of the workouts 3 times/week) to fully rehab your pelvic floor and then just maintenance Kegels after that. It is a wonderful product for only $30!!! I HIGHLY recommend it to ANY new mom with or without prolapse. It can not only help current prolapse issues but also help prevent them in the future!!"
5,It's an excellent program!,"I'm very grateful to Mrs Mullingan's Pelvic floor work-out : it's very easy to do,and after one month you can both feel and see the difference! Pelvic Floor is really ""healthier"" and it's very pleasant too, you will see your stomach is really more tough and flat. I have four children... and now I feel much more healthier and self confident. And when you begin to see results, it gives you motivation and energy, even after a rough day, to do one of the three different work-out."
3,A little disappointing,So far...3 weeks into this and not impressed but still hopeful. The therapist is a bit annoying.because she keeps repeating the same commands for each exercise. You're sure to mute the volume once you know the routine.
3,Product good or not good?,"At first i thought this DVD might be the answer to my problem, but then i noticed that there are two bad reviews and those who responded to it got really defensive about the low rating. This makes me wonder if the good reviews were really real. If they were really written by those who actually bought the video. I mean, everyone is entitle to their opinions, why getting bad about it. For example, the lady who couldn't play it on her DVD player except on her computer. Instead of getting mad, give her suggestions on what to do!"
2,Frustrating Experience,"I was really hoping this DVD would help, but all it did was frustrate my many attempts to play it. It came to me very dirty! After trying to play it on numerous DVD players and then cleaning it several times, the DVD finally played. The information was good on the DVD...but the experience of trying to get it to play was grueling.Another huge disappointment was that this item comes with no written list of the exercises...so if you want to do them on your own without a DVD player you are out of luck. I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the exercises as it is almost impossible to do them unless you plan on doing them in the same location day after day. I thought it would come with a booklet which would be a synopsis of the contents of what the DVD contained. I am very disappointed in thisHab It: Pelvic Floorproduct."
4,Very Informative!,I don't have any medical issues. I just was looking for something to help strengthen me. I think this is a very informative video to help strengthen the PC muscles. I hadn't realized there was more to remaining in tact then just kegels. The instructions are clear with good pictures and explanations. I do additional squats with the video after learning how important squats are for the PC muscles as well.
5,Saved me from surgery!,"After the somewhat traumatic (for me) birth of my son, I had a severe prolapsed uterus. After two years it had not improved, but had progressed to a stage three. My OB/GYN recommended surgery. I almost scheduled but I decided to give this a try first. My goodness. In four weeks I've gone back to nearly where I was before pregnancy. I was always been ""shallow"" and I still have a couple of inches before everything is perfect, but my cervix is now at least four inches higher. They should hand these out at the hospital. I even had a midwife. How could we not know about this before? I'm serious when I say this video saved me 20 grand and major surgery."
5,A postpartum lifesaver,"After a rough delivery, at about 3 weeks I diagnosed my own rectocele. I had a natural delivery, and felt betrayed that my body was so traumatized, and found the symptoms very uncomfortable. In a fit of despair, I ordered this dvd, and was elated to find that after 2 weeks of regular use, my body started to feel normal again. Incidentally, I slacked for a week,thinking I was fixed, and my prolapse symptoms started to return. These exercises work, and also provide some gentle toning postpartum. Prolapse is something women should talk about more, and prepare each other for the possibility postpartum. I highly recommend!"
5,So far so good,"I've been using the DVD for 3-4 weeks, and I've already seen improvement. The instructions/demonstrations on the DVD are clear and easy to follow. Her attitude is very encouraging.I didn't notice this on any product descriptions before I bought the DVD, but she does recommend using an exercise ball and a smaller ball for some of the exercises. I have a small ball and have used a chair in place of the exercise ball. (She says you can substitute a pillow for the small ball, and a chair for the exercise ball.) This has worked quite well, except that there is one exercise in the final workout that I could not on a chair. You may have better luck, but I'm avoiding that workout, which is still too advanced for me anyway, until I get an exercise ball."
4,"Effective, but a large time committment","I have noticed a difference after just a few rounds, but the routines take about 20 minutes each, plus the time to set up the dvd, and I have a hard time doing them regularly. This is of course my fault, not the program's, which is an excellent program, easy to do and easy to follow. But if you have a busy schedule, you might prefer a kegel excersizer, which does't require a DVD and set amount of time."
5,Pelvic Floor exercises,This is a fantastic DVD!Every new mother needs a copy of this!Don't wait until you develop incontinence.Tasha's sessions are exactly what you'd get if you made the effort to go to a physical therapist. This way you get the lessons in the privacy of you own home.
4,Great single and for a good cause,"I would easily rate this as U2's best single from the 'Achtung Baby' record. First of all, ""One"" is a classic. Second, this is the only place you can get the studio version of Lou Reed's ""Satellite of Love"", the theme song of the memorable ZooTV tour. Third, ""Lady with a Spinning Head"" is a relatively good b-side and an interesting outgrowth of the same groove that seems to have spawned ""The Fly"" and ""Ultraviolet"" on 'Achtung Baby'. Fourth, from what I understand, the profits from the sale of the single will go to AIDS charities."
2,Hardly inspiring.,This CD-Single is representative of the general pentecostal milieu within which Bono continually places himself. Dake's influence is salient.
3,Why no directions?,"I've been outfitting my bike recently and am frustrated to find that nothing I buy comes with instructions! It took me while, but study of the partial picture provided helped me realize that the bungee-hook straps are meant to hook at the center of your front wheel, on either side. A little tricky. On the plus side, this is fairly roomy (though somehow smaller than I'd pictured) and comes with a detachable strap, so that you can walk off wearing it when you park your bike. The strap isn't actually long enough to be worn messenger-style, though, and you have to remove the hooks if you don't want them flapping around everywhere when you walk."
4,Nice front pack,"This is about the size of a small purse. I like the bungy cord feature because it keeps the bag secure and immovable on your bike. It is relatively easy to remove and take into the store with you. When it is full, however, it is a bit unruly when trying to reattach it to the handlebars and takes a bit of a balancing act."
5,Excellent bike bag,"This bag fits perfectly on my Trek mountain bike. It is large enough to hold my keys, wallet, phone, ipod, and some snacks. The elastic straps that connect to the wheel ensure it doesn't bounce around. Great product, highly recommended."
1,Hey! Where are the missing Discs,"Hey! i had been looking for a particular song for a long time by the Hilltoppers TILL THEN. They have this song in two versus, and i have on vinyle albumm but wanted to get it on CD. On Amazon they have Hilltoppers CDs with this song,but it don't sound like the album that i have, but finally searching through Amazon i found it here on this 1950 ROCK -N- ROLL COLLECTION,so i was looking forward to getting it as soon as possible, just because of this song,i didn't care much about the others, and guess what happens. I finally receive the collection and what happens, i'am missing discs about 2 more and the reason i bought this collection because of this song, that particular CD is missing. Hey! if whomever is in charge of this, i would appreciate if you would send the missing CDs. TILL THEN...DAVE..."
4,"Wonderful, well developed characters .....","To Save His Baby by Judi LindHarlequin Intrigue # 531 - September 1999part of the Memory Away multi-author mini-seriesGil disappeared suddenly from Valerie's life, and when she couldn't find a trace of him, she concludes that he no longer wants anything more to do with her. Now he's turned up in her ER, and he doesn't remember her. He's suffering amnesia from a car crash. Valerie didn't know that Gil had been working undercover at the hospital looking for clues in a baby abduction ring, and that she's one of the suspects. Now as she tries to help him find the missing babies, she is faced with the delimma of telling Gil of their past relationship and about the baby she carries; one he doesn't remember conceiving.Both Gil and Valerie are wonderful, well developed characters. Ms. Lind has a great talent of weaving romance and suspense. I think I'll be reading this one again!"
1,This makes the Blair Witch video look `like 2001 in comparison,"I wish I had read the reviews before I subjected myself to this trash. If a group of people tried to make the worst possible movie ever, it would be a miracle no matter how skillful they were.I think the scene where they come across a tree with condoms, handcuffs and dildos hanging from it was the most off the wall, or maybe the scene where the girl is humping the tree.Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED. The scene where they encounter a phone booth in the middle of the forest has the music (if you can call it that) from 2001 and has them worshipping the phone booth like the monkeys worshipped the obelisk."
1,Waste of time.,THIS FILM IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MAY KILL BRAIN CELLS!!We started skipping ahead through this film after the first 10 min looking for something worth watching and never found anything. The dialog. well I just can't find the words to discribe how bad it was.
3,GFF ZZ Gundam (Full Armor ZZ),"This action figure is highly detailed, and made for display on a shelf. It is limited in its range of motion, and poseability. It is hard to assemble all the tiny pieces without others falling off. Again it is highly detailed, and once in position it looks great, but it's not meant to move around. It also has a problem with both feet not being able to straighten out completely."
5,MUST HAVE IN THE KITCHEN,I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS PAN//MAKES THE BEST LASAGNA EVER...I USE IT FOR ROASTING AS WELL. I PLAN ON GETTING ONE FOR MY SISTER
4,Ear Candy's companion piece,"Tape Head sounded a little strange, coming as it did directly after the lush, orchestrated Ear Candy, but it all makes sense in retrospect. The albums are best viewed as companion pieces, with Tape Head being the dark side of mid-90s King's X. Bassist Doug Pinnick dominates the lead vocals on the album, and almost without exception, his songs are dark, be they angry or depressed. Guitarist Ty Tabor is given only one song, ""Ocean,"" that serves as a bright spot in the middle of the record.Including that godawful final track was a bad move on the band's part, but because it's at the end of the album, it's easy enough to avoid. Tape Head is easily a 4-star album, and one of King's X's finest works."
5,Another gem from the Austin trio.,"I have been a fan of these guys for years and every time they release a new cd, I can never seem to find a reason to take it out of my disc changer. Well, their latest effort, amply titled ""Tape Head"", is no exception. With such songs as ""Groove Machine"", ""Cupid"", and ""Happy"", this trio of musicians somehow finds a way to expand their abilities instead of rehashing past efforts. Don't get me wrong now, I love their spiritual themes, but it is great to hear them experiment with their sound and come out victorious. Maybe one of these days they'll get the mass appeal they so richly deserve."
5,This Album Rocks!,"King's X accomplishes what most bands can only dream of doing. Doug, Ty, and Jerry manage to combine heavy, groovin' licks with excellent vocal melodies and harmonies. Tape Head is an awesome representation of down-to-earth, straight-forward, rock-n-roll!"
2,"King's X, King's X, where for art thee?","Not to say this album completely stinks, but it certainly isn't their best. I found most of the lyrics and music redundant. Essentially ""Dogman"" all over again, the album doesn't explore new musical territory (except maybe Jerry playing more than four drums the entire album) or highlight their known talents. I salivated hearing just the few chords of classic King's X at the beginning of ""Farkas"" simply because I longed for it so much after listening to this album."
5,Ron Rocks,"I agree with Ron Manning, to a ""T"" (not for Texas -- I'm a Packer fan!) When I first picked up Tape Head, I was kind of unimpressed. But I've always found that the greatest CD's take time to grow on you. It's my favorite King's X CD. Welcome to the Groove Machine, baby!"
5,Time to upgrade your car audio system.,"Stripped down, occasionally slowed down, but man, the high points of this album are right up there with anything ever recorded. Most bands will never come close to recording a song half as good as ""Ono"" or ""Happy"", but for these guys, that's an established level of quality and artwork.King's X has established such a ridiculously high level of expectations that anything they release is going to be examined under a very harsh light, yet they continue to blow past previous highs. Highlights of the album include ""Groove Machine"", ""Fade"" (which should be an AOR staple but'll never get any airplay), ""Ono"", and the throat-rending, soul-battering, wall-shaking ""Happy"", which is reminiscent of one of those surprisingly hard Beatles songs where John Lennon was possessed by some supernatural force of genius looking for an earthly vessel and finding it in these three musicians.To quote Lynryd Skynyrd: ""Turn it up."""
5,Tape Head fresh and full of energy!!!,"After Eye-Candy a bit of energy would be nice from Doug, Jerry, and Ty. And ""Tape Head"" is NICE! It rocks bigtime! More groovin riffs, and lots crunch, but they still keep their great harmonies. The live track is quite strange, and I still can't figure out why they decided to put it on the album. But I give thumbs up! Some of their best work!"
3,Has Some Good Songs,"I received Tape Head as a present a few months ago and just recently started giving it a fair amount of listening. One thing I can say is that it's much heavier than Earcandy, and is more in the vein of Dogman than the preceding album. Tracks that are the best are ""Groove Machine,"" ""Fade,"" and ""Higher than God."" This isn't one of my favorite King's X releases, but they have yet to release an album that's a disappointment. Every album has some good moments. As of any album they've released, this album has cool guitar playing and backing vocals. King's X is one of the best bands out there. ""Walter Bela Farkas"" is a really funny ending bit for this album--everytime I hear it, I can't help from cracking up."
5,The best King's X yet(?),"This is a great album, perhaps King's X's best. I haven't been this impressed since Gretchen Goes to Nebraska. And while this I like this album as much as that one, it is different. The songs are shorter and rawer, and the songs have more pop hooks. Definitely less angry than Dogman, but more aggressive than Ear Candy; at least 80% of these songs could be a hit if they were to get radio airplay. I'm impressed by the variety of the songs on the album, from the Husker Du-ish guitar line of World, to Little Bit of Soul which sounds like you might think it would from its title. (Admittedly, the first and last songs on the album are throwaway songs.)If you were disappointed by the post-Gretchen Goes to Nebraska albums like I was, this album is a real treat. Also a great introduction to the band."
5,as usual...i can't stop listening to this!,"when is the world going to realize that king's x is one of the best bands in the world...the opening song on tape head says it all...""groove machine""...thats what they are...since atlantic records so badly dropped the ball on these guys, lets hope metal blade can pick up the slack... saw them live two weeks ago in cincinatti and they blew my mind...Doug, Ty,and Jerry will go down as one of the best power trios ever!"
1,Eh.,"I teach math for a living and bought this book with high hopes. But, I found its questions to be less innovative than work I had already produced on my own. Slightly and occasionally ""gross"", in a student sense, as an attempt to be engaging, you can probably create more intersting problems on your own just by reading the newspapers and applying a bit of immagination. Just extrapolate any story to the absurd or ask the class clown to gross you out based on the news item.Basically, it did not live up to the hype and is far too expensive for few problems you do get. Spend your money buying your local paper."
1,"MOVIE WAS GREAT, BUT!!!!!!!!!!","I ENJOYED THE MOVIE, BUT THERE IS A FLAW IN THE DISC. THE MOVIE WILL NOT START UNTIL YOU PLAY WITH IT FOR AWHILE. ALSO NEAR THE END IT WILL STOP AND DO A FREEZE FRAME. THIS THE FIRST MOVIE I'VE RECEIVED LIKE THIS, BUT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH IT, NOT WORTH THE HASSLE OF RETURNING IT."
5,Dirty Laundry,The moive was great. It came fast and I got a great deal. I order all my dvd from amazon.com.
4,Cute and Endearing,"Being a fan of Rockmond Dunbar and Loretta Devine, I made it a point of seeing this movie in its theatrical release. And I also knew it would become a part of my DVD collection. It's not the best out there but it's entertaining, cute and endearing. Rockmond Dunbar is to be applauded for his courage as an American black actor willing to take on these kinds of roles. He did a good job."
3,Dirty Laundry,This movie was o.k. too me because I'm not into a movie that have the mix issues of todays society and then forcing the children to accept them. It just had to much going on. I really would not recommend this movie to anyone. I bought it and it's one that I would not look at twice.
4,My laundry is very similar to this,"I was very resistant to watching this movie because I thought it was going to be campy beyond belief and poorly written. At the insistence of a friend, I watched the movie and I do NOT regret it. It is true to the T of how it is to be gay, black man and how African American deals with homosexuality. In real life it's not as great as this portrayal, but it's nice to see it finally on screen. This film is hilarious. I ROFLed (seriously) a few times throughout and found myself wanting to watch it again. I could've docked two stars because Rockmond Dunbar's portrayal of Sheldon/Patrick was a bit much and I feel like they could've made better choices with the score, the ending credits and there is an obvious flub in the beginning involving a character's wardrobe (see if you can spot it). But it made for all of these by being funny, relevant and honest. Buy this film, you'll love it."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This movie is awful from the start. I rented it and was totally disappointed. I actually had to turn it off after about thirty minutes. It seems to celebrate homosexuality and tries to marry it with Christianity. I was appalled as a believer. If you are a Christian, this is not the movie for you. Great cast, but horrible storyline and even worse acting."
4,Dirty Laundry,I was given this movie as a gift and was quite surprised by it. Very Funny at times and also has messages about family love and forgiveness. I was also surprised by some of the hateful reviews here by some calling themselves Christians. Well they might find out on judgement day their hatred and judgement is more a sin than homosexuality is.
4,never too old (or drunk) to change,"What a funny, funny movie! Loretta Devine was an absolute riot (Jenifer Lewis was no slouch either)! Loretta kept me laughing. And the way she had her cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth was too funny. The little girl named ""Pudge"" cracked me up too especially the way she spoke to Sheldon aka Patrick when she woke him up with her loud music. She acted like an old soul in a child's body. When she was dancing, I said, ""You go girl!"" I enjoyed the singing. The people in The Nashville Super Choir had some serious pipes! I liked the fact that in the end, the main characters changed for the better. Let's face it, at the end of the day, the only things that really matter are love and family."
4,This Movie Was OK,"I received this movie way ahead of time and it was in good condition. As for the movie, I would just once see Loretta Devine in a movie where she is not an attitudish, know it all black woman. Jenifer Lewis is the best part of this movie. She always steals the scenes."
3,SECRETS AND LIES,"THE FILM DIRTY LAUNDRY, CHRONICLES A GAY NEW YORK MAGAZINE WRITER WHO HAS ESCAPED HIS SOUTHERN HOMETOWN, AS WELL AS HIS FAMILY'S JUDGEMENT. THAT IS , UNTIL HIS ILEGITIMATE SON KNOCKS ON HIS DOOR AND SPURS AN UNFORSEEN TRIP BACK HOME. THE PROTAGONIST, PLAYED BY ROCKMOND DUNBAR, IS SURROUNDED BY A PHOTOGENIC AND OFTERN COMEDIC CAST THAT INCLUDES LORETTA DEVINE, JENIFER LEWIS AND GOSPEL LEGENF BOBBY JONES."
5,Continue the education,"I really enjoyed the movie. The storyline was great. The actors were wonderful (""Kudos"" to Loretta Devine). It made me really proud to know that Black writers/producers could present a movie, dealing with gay life relationships, in a positive family oriented atmosphere. I was also honored that the movie showed that gay families CAN and DO provide their children with loving homes and positive family structure. THANKS to ALL and please continue to educate others!"
5,I love it,Favorite I love this the movie was great comical and real and tasteful i love all the actors and all of the characters
5,Feast on this book!,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend after telling her that I was preparing to lead a women's group on fasting later this year. I first found the book at John Piper's website, Desiring God, but after reading a few pages online, I had to have the paper version to mark up to my heart's delight! I wasn't disappointed. Piper gets right to the heart of fasting using biblically sound support and moves past the myths and mysteries of it. I was pleased to see how much time he spent writing about Isaiah 58 and touching on fasting from things other than just food. Piper's book is a great resource for anyone wanting to more deeply connect with the heart of God through the discipline of fasting as a regular part of their walk with Him."
5,Get this book.,"As with anything that Piper writes, he causes me to think deeply about God & His Word. I appreciate how he provokes us."
3,Not realy what I was looking for....,I did not read the whole book. I will not finish it. In my opinion from what I have read the book is too soft and kind of boring.
3,An incomplete look at fasting,"I read this book to learn about fasting because it's something I haven't practiced but thought that maybe I should. Piper is brilliant in stating why he thinks Christians should fast and in suggesting reasons to fast (such as our longing for the return of Christ), but he falls short in the how-to department. The closest he comes is on page 126 where he says we can avoid the physical dangers of fasting by following a few simple guidelines. Then he footnotes to the back where he recommends a couple books that apparently list the guidelines. How complex are those ""simple guidelines"" that he can't list them himself? Doesn't that seem a no-brainer in a book of this sort, to cover the practical aspects of fasting?Piper's thorough in telling me why I should fast, but how can I practice what he preaches if he neglects such a fundamental component?"
5,A Hunger For God,John Piper writes about a intricate part of worship that is practiced little in today's christian living. He gives God's view on fasting and prayer. The book is well written.
5,Excellent lenses!,"These glasses are outstanding! Extremely lightweight and comfortable. The lenses are incredible! Even in low light the difference they make is amazing. I've used them for driving as well as on my boat @ 60+ mph, no wind gets thru. Best glasses I've ever owned!"
3,Frame not comfortable.,"The Maestrale sunglasses did not fit me well and felt uncomfortable. They did however, have the superior lenses that are typical of Serengeti sunglasses."
3,theyre ripping you off,i just wanted to tell you ppl that u can buy one from aiptex's website for around 60 dollars.
1,Beautiful.....but useless,"Yes, is a beautiful gadget, it's light and affordable, but, at least my specimen, is almost useless.Why?I have to change batteries every 2 or 3 photos or every 15-30 seconds of recording movie. And if you don't illuminate with a 1,000,000 candles light (literally, I did it) you wont be able to record any indor movie. And, if the batteries are very fresh, I mean really fresh, and you are able to take a picture, every snapshot will take almost 30 seconds to record in a 512 Mb card, so forget spontanity.I didn't expect for this price major brand quality, only to have an always handy device to record some short movies of my daughter, but this is ridiculous.I do not return the item because I'm out of country...."
3,Fills a niche,"This is NOT a well-rounded documentary as claimed, but it fills a niche in the ever-expanding library of Beatles material. It focuses on the ""dark"" side of the Beatles story, leaving out the joy, generosity and, most of all, the music. But no doubt most of it is true, and it has its place in balancing the bigger picture."
1,Rubbish,"The highlight of the first 30 minutes is Paul McCartney never paid back Allan Williams 15 quid and a bar maid in Hamburg wasn't very impressed by their first gig. Woo hoo. A giant waste of time. There is only about 5 minutes of juicy material and almost everything is sound bytes from out of context interviews or misleading innuendo like ""accused of arson in Hamburg"" (but never actually charged). Is it really a secret that John was violent? He very famously admitted on a TV interview that he was ""a hitter"". The entire ""documentary"" was overtly agenda driven and has hardly a shred of hard evidence. Almost everything is conjecture and you'll also notice that most of those interviewed qualify almost every comment they make. I suppose if you didn't know Brian Epstein was gay or the Beatles took drugs and had lots of sex with girls other than their wives you'd be shocked but this DVD is pretty much worthless drivel..."
3,"Solid 20th century recording, The 21st century recording is needed","We desperately need a new recording of Aida. I have just bought this one. With all respect, this is Aida on the 20th century. We are well advanced in the 21st. Katia Ricciarelly and my compatriot Elena Obrastzova are doing their best, but this is about all they can do. All other protagonists, including the fantastic Lucia Valentini Terrani, are far ahead of the two key female singers. OK as a historic account of the great classics. Muti (1982) (Caballé, Domingo, Cossotto, Ghiaurov, Cappuccilli) remains my favorite.Is Pappano (Netrebko, etc) coming)?."
1,Don't even think about buying this product,"This is some outdated product with cheap construction. I returned this product to company and wasted my money because i never received a refund or feed back. I am giving it a one star rating because nothing below is possible.I had one of the worst buying experience with this product, where you suffer from paying for this product and then sending it back but getting nothing in return."
5,The Matrix trailer music!!,I was lookin everywhere for the music off the Matrix trailer because I loved it and after alot of research I found it and all I can say is that this single is the BOMB!!!
5,A must read for treating people suffering from schizophrenia,Drs. Karon and Vandenbos have written a book that allows anyone with a serious interest in helping individuals who suffer from schizophrenia to better understand the psychology that is all too often overlooked . The simple truths conveyed in this book will illuminate the desparate lives of individuals who are unfortunate enough to have fallen into psychosis and have yet to find a way out on their own. It is an excellent stimulus that can trigger one's own creativty which is essential in effective treatment with those caught in psychosis. I continue to rely on the lessons learned in this book after having read it 14 years ago!
2,Humane?,"Blaming the parents of schizophrenics for causing their child's illness through bad parenting and their own conflicts is humane? To whom? Certainly not the parents of a schizophrenic adolescent or young adult. It is shocking that psychoanalytic clinicians can get away with positing such rot, and that no one seems to challenge it critically. Good luck trying to run contolled clinical trials with an intervention that cannot be ""blind"" to the patient or clinician. In other words, much of the hypotheses of the authors are untestable. Their suppositions are long on conjecture and short on good, valid supporting data that would pass muster in a non-analytic peer-reviewed journal."
5,A sound too wicked to be called a scream,"Master storyteller Joe Lansdale does it again. He tells us the story of Morley, cuckolded husband, and Dennis, ex-basketball player who loves Morley's wife.This is a nasty little revenge tale, told with Lansdale's special little dashes of blood and guts for seasoning. Add in some Dobermans, a chemical attractant and a man bent on revenge. But remember - revenge can work both ways.If you have a weak stomach or a tender heart for dogs, this story might not be for you. But if you like a great short story, try this one of Lansdale's. You won't be sorry (although it might come back to haunt you on Valentine's Days in the future)."
4,"violent,suspense filled story","A fast moving,violent,suspense filled short story..A hunter vs hunted thriller that keeps you on the edge..Not a story for the weak hearted.."
5,Great product!,Got this for a Xmas gift and was happy about the price. Works extremely well and the person who received it is thrilled!
3,Sony RML1AM Remote Commander Shutter Release Cable,It works well with my camera but is awkward because of the wire. Button tends to stick occasionally but it's generally decent for taking photos when a camera is on a tripod and you must be at a different point.
4,intriguing,This book was a fun read. I could not put it down. Dark and Mysterious while laugh out loud funny. this book is Strongly Recommended.
5,A must for college graduates,"I was very fortunate to have read this book ""Guerilla Tactics for Job Seekers"", it really reveals the secrets and facts of life to face this world to how to Get the Job I wanted by overcoming objections and confidence by reading this wonderful book. Now I got a good job and my family is also happy thanks to this book by Mr. R. E. Payne MBA PH. D. I would suggest to the fresh graduates to read this book and gain the confidence to come up in this competitive world."
5,A must for all U2 fans,All U2 fans should have this in their collection. All five versions are great. With a song this good there is no need to clutter this single with any other tracks. If you like this keep your eyes out for another version of this single with nine versions of this awesome song and a bonus poster.
1,BAD BAD BAD,"Dont expect it to work for too long(3 days of regular use aprox after things go wrong with the pads), and Please dont expectANY CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM THE COMPANY. they just wount answer any email to you back (forget about calling...) their product must be the worst purchase I have ever done. Its a shame cause the price is great. and if it did work as it should, it would have been an actually great buy."
4,Great for a beginner drummer,"I bought this set for my son's 9th Bday, and paid $150 for them at a store. He is a small 9 year old and they are a great size for him to use.For the price I got them this is perfect for him. It doesn't take up a much space in his room. I love the headphone attachment so he can sit and play without disrupting the whole house. My husband also hooked them up to speakers through a receiver for him so he can disrupt the house if he wants too.No double drum beat problems with our footpad that were mentioned in many previous reviews."
2,Ugh!,"I received this drum set as a quieter alternative to my acoustic set so that I could practice while in my apartment at college. The first thing that put me off and that others seem to have commented on is the double kick or click from the pedals(which started the first time I played the set) The thing that really made this unusable was the fact that one of the pedals fell completely apart after five days and the other CONSTANTLY gives me a double kick or just some jumble of a kick. This set probably good for kids who want to learn to play drums, but I agree with other reviewers when I say if you want quality look elsewhere."
2,HORRIBLE!,i bought this a couple months ago and it was really good except the volume is really low even at full!!! blast..the sound quality is pretty good...But than after the second day the bass pedal and hi hat pedal where going off like crazy when i was playing it sound like a 5 pedals all at once when i only did it once!!!!I returned it a couple of months ago....if i where u i would not buy this!!!
2,PIECE OF CRAP!!!,This only good for bangin on for fun. the pads break easily. there are almost know dynamics. there are no dynamics on the pedals. not worth buying what so ever!
2,Save your money,"I bought this set to practice with in my apartment. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the low price. The double triggering of the kick drum is simply atrocious and really ruined my purchase. It makes it very difficult to even practice (which is why I bought the kit) because it is constantly double triggering and failing to trigger on other occasions. The toms, snare and cymbals perform adequately-no complaints here. The pads do make quite a bit of noise when struck. The kit has a loose, cheap feel to it (to be expected from the price), I have to constantly tighten up the wing nuts. My suggestion- save your money for whatever comes next in line."
1,Don't waste your time,I bought this for my son for christmas. It worked for 30 minutes. I contacted Ion-audio and was on hold for 20 minutes. They did offer to repair the module but it would take 7-8 weeks. I went to amazon and this item cannot be exchanged because it is out of stock even though it is still available to be purchased. Thanks guys and Merry Christmas!!
2,Multiple hits on the pedals made it unusable in my book,"Background: I am a guitar player of about 33 years. I decided to try drums for the first time in my life. I didn't want to spend a fortune so I opted for this set despite the reviews. I am pleased that I am actually a half decent drummer! I guess the ability to keep time combined with the previous music knowledge helps.The sound quality of this system is really pretty good and I was pleased for a few days.. Then the pedals started acting up. I would get two, three even four hits on the bass and hi hat occasionally! This made the unit unplayable to me. I did see a video on youtube where a guy put some capacitors in the pedals to cure the problem but I feel that you shouldn't have to work on a brand new product to make t useable, so back to Amazon it went. It would be great if Ion would just address this problem and raise the price accordingly to make this set usable."
1,"Sucks, sucks, sucks.","These are a joke! You'd be better off to buy a $100 Yamaha drum pad. These drums are cheap, flimsy, sometimes the hit will sound, sometimes it won't. These will just frustrate you, save your money! I've already resold mine on ebay at a loss."
4,"Good price , Good quality",Good to learn how to play. No technical problem.Easy to instal.I recommend itPascal
2,"Unauthentic tasting, just an 'onion soup'.","I guess they added sugar cane juice to emulate the caramelization flavor that comes from slow cooking onions to perfection. Wrong idea though, this soup instead leaves a sweet flavor in your mouth, as opposed to a more serious, earthy, cognac-reduction flavor that I would expect from an authentic french onion soup. This just a sweet onion soup. Leave the french out."
3,Too sweet,Its an okay onion soup. Plenty of onions but a tad bit too sweet for me. Added croutons to make it better. Probably not going to try again.
1,Where did the sugar come from,This is the most awful french onion soup I have ever tasted. Since when do you add Cane Sugar to vegetable broth. I rate this -5 stars
2,My Review for the Agents and managers book,I was surprised by how many numbers were disconnected in the book. I guess it goes to show that it is hard to break into Hollywood or get someone to read a script.
4,Lots of easy to read recipes,"Great guideline for cookie mixes in a jar, she even provides tags you xerox or cut out for directions!"
2,great ideas but dry,"Although I thought this book had great ideas, when I went to sample the recipes before I made them for friends, I found the consistency of the dough very dry and impossible to ""spoon"" out by rounded spoonfuls. I had to use my hands to smush the dough together. I may have to make my own recipes instead."
2,"Too Sweet, Too Dry","There's a good, scientific reason that most cookie recipes have you cream together butter and sugar before you add ingredients. The problem with this book--like many mason jar cookie cookbooks--is that the cookie recipes seem to be just ""regular"" cookie recipes made without doing that step first. The resulting cookies have little taste and are overpoweringly sweet and dry. I only tried two...but after two, I couldn't bear to try any more."
3,"Good recipes, but not many recipes","I have most of the books in this series. My parents are aging and I have been looking for items that I can make for them which will have a long shelf life and would require them to do minimal food preparation, yet still have a 'home cooked meal'. The recipes fit the bill for the most part. In each book I found that there were a few recipes that are great and some I wouldn't try at all. This is what I usually find in any cookbook. I would comment that each book only has about 25 or so recipes in it. The rest of the pages consist of 6 copies each of pre-made instruction cards to enclose with each food package. I did feel disappointed in the number of recipes for the cost of the book"
3,Too thin and crispy...dry,"I'm making some of these gift-in-a-jar cookies for holiday gifts. I tried the recipe before actually giving the gifts away, and I am very glad that I did. The cookies turned out very thin and crispy, as if they didn't contain enough flour or oats. I experimented in my kitchen, and by adding about 1/4 cup oats to the jar mix, the cookies turned out very delicious.I also think that it would have been nice if the book had given you more than six of each of the gift cards.This book is very nice, but I'd try the recipes before giving them away."
4,Great fun in a jar!!!,"All of the books I ordered are great fun for the senior population I work with...they are able, even with a handicap to make these gifts for others and have pride in what they make."
1,Does not cover what is on the test!,I've read the book. I've taken (and failed) the test. They don't cover or stress the same material.
1,About 80% of this book did NOT appear on the exam.,"I took the Solutions exam, and there was not 1 question on the exam regarding Microsoft Solution Framework. About half of this book concentrates on that. Of the topics that did appear on the exam, this book only briefly defined them. This book is a waste of time and money!!!"
1,Not at all relevent to the actual exam,The authors of this book parrot lot of stuff that you can find in microsoft web site. But I find none of what they have written make any sense in the actual exam. The exam is beased on real life case studies whereas this book gives lots of in coherant theory.
1,Does not prepare for Exam 70-100,"Having just taken Exam 70-100, I can say that this book does NOT prepare you for it.The book does not address the new question formats at all. It covers the Microsoft Solution Framework extensively, but there was NOT a single question on this topic per se.While it is a reasonably good book on MSF, it is in no way a preparation for Exam 70-100."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"This book is badly written, repeats itself, has incorrect answers and is absolutely no help in passing the exam - oh and the cd-based test exams are completely useless. The book covers MSF and nothing else - trouble is, MSF is not covered in the exam. Someone should take the publishers to court for misrepresentation.I tried to give this book no stars, but this wasn't allowed, so it gets one star, but actually deserves a negative rating for the time you will waste if you buy it."
1,For MCSD 70-100 Test IS USELESS,"Maybe it could be good book for learning about Microsoft Solution Framework but for studying for the 70-100 Test is COMPLETELY USELESS. Don't buy this book if you are intending to pass this exam, its has nothing to do with it. Besides its a really BIG BOOK full of theory on how to implement an IT Project"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"More than 50% of this book consisteng of 11 chapters, does not contain matrerial that Microsoft lists as objectives for writing the exam! The rest of the book (Chapers 7 to 11) has no down to earth technical material. The acompanying CD does not have any real-world test examples LIKE those that occurs in the test. (HOW CAN MICROSOFT PUT THEIR NAME ON THIS BOOK and promote it as a study guide for their tests??)Bottom line is, dont buy this book. You'll prepare yourself better by gettiong in a good night sleep the night before, than trying learn something.It doesnt even deserve one star!"
1,"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT PICK UP THIS BOOK FOR A GUIDE","I have studied this book cover to cover 5 times, repeatedly taken the practice exams several times. I took the exam and failed BADLY.The material on the exam had NOTHING to do what was in the book. The little material I did know on the exam was based on common sense and previous knowledge.It was so bad I walked up to the administrator and told him I must be taking the wrong test! Unfortunately I wasn't and got screwed.I wasted 100 dollars on the exam and 50 dollars on the book."
1,Don't listen to the 4 and 5 star ratings.,"The people giving this book a 4 or 5 star rating obviously have not taken the exam. I have taken the exam and passed, so I can honestly tell you that this book does not help at all for 70-100, and is really a rip-off to people trying to become Microsoft Certified. The book covers and is a great reference for MSF, but it has nothing to do with the exam.I also find it dispicable that this web site shows a 5-star review first and calls it review of the day, even though that review was written a long time ago. The big A needs to look over their Product Review Engine, because I constantly see this on other useless books, including all 70-100 books that made the same mistake as this one.All of the 4 and 5 ratings skew the real value of this book, which is 0 for preparing for the exam."
2,Should be bundled with a dictionary.,"I found this book on the whole okay, but really struggled with some of the terminolgy. Choices of words have been made that make the content more complex and not simpler to understand."
3,lack of example,"It's a theory intensive book. It's lack of example. Anyway it covers most of the concept of exam 70-100, worth reading."
2,Too much design and Microsoft specific data in this book,A lot of data about Microsoft method of development but very few about activities closely related to requirements. Old models: ERD without newer alternatives. Too much about risks and costs and too few about effective analysis of needs. The CD ROM is smart and the self test is effective.
1,This book as NOTHING to do with the actual exam,Those people that say that this book helped them have probably passed the exam and therefore are overly optimistic.
1,This book did absolutely nothing to prepare me for the exam.,This book did not cover any of the information presented in the 70-100 exam. I was very disappointed with the book.
1,Why did Microsoft endorse this book?,This book has very little to do with 70-100. It amazes me that this book is an Microsoft approved study guide. Now we know relevant Microsoft approval is! NOT!
1,A useless book for exam!,I passed the test with 839 but no credits to this book. It only wasted my time and money. A typical failure example of rashing out a poor quality book by Syngress. Should ask themself how long they could stand in the market!
1,Horrid - Does not address the Exam AT ALL,"This book is HUGE - and full of interesting information, but neither the format of the practice exams or the CONTENT addresses ANYTHING on the exam. If you are studying for the exam - DO NOT buy this book. KP - MCSD, MCT, MCT, CNA, A+"
1,SUCKS!!!!!!,"This is the worst book I've ever read. None of the exam topics are covered! More that half the book is relevant to the MSF, but there are no MSF questions on the exam. The rest of the book is also useless. I just passed the exam, but only thanks to my real-world. The quality of Syngress books just keeps on falling... soon they will have to pay YOU to read their books."
1,It covers nothing that was on the exam!,Can you give a negative number of stars? Don't waste your money on this!
1,Not a good preparation tool for 70-100,The book has some good info in it however as a tool for passing the 70-100 exam it is poor. The tests drill you on material the exam does not even touch. As a preparation tool for 70-100 it rates very poorly. Look elsewhere.
1,Please don't rely on this book for 70-100,"Why would anyone give 5 stars to this book unless they were one of the author's friends?If you really want to see what the exam is like, download Microsoft's free sample test. You will notice that this book completely misses the mark. As a study guide for 70-100 the book is USELESS. The authors should have done their homework better. As a meandering tour of software project methodology (especially what can go wrong) the book is interesting, and if you have managed projects before you will find yourself smiling as you recognize mistakes that you've made. Interesting reading, but not for test preparation.The best preparation for this test is to design software yourself for a while.By the way, thanks to Amazon for giving people a great way to find about books.-Lou Keeble"
1,This book covers almost nothing on the actual exam!,"Having taken the test, I can say with certainity that this book, while informative concerning MSF, does very, VERY, little to prepare the reader for the exam. Anyone who writes otherwise either hasn't taken the exam or is ""stuffing the ballet box"" for the authors in an attempt to raise the now plummeting review rating for this book."
1,did the author bother to TAKE the exam????,"A well written book about stuff that has nothing to do with the test. I've passed the test, but it was solely by experience. All of the discussions are framed in context of MSF, which is cool and all, but MSF is not an exam objective."
3,Good info on MSF--will NOT help you on the test,"I am not here to bash this book. It is a great book with a bad title. A more appropriate title would be ""Understanding the MSF"". As far as prepping for the test, this book is not for you."
2,"Good source about MSF, bad exam prep book","This book is sold as an exam preparation book. As such, it fails miserably. It is, however, a good introduction to MSF, if you want to know something about this topic.It does not address the new test format introduced with this test at all. Also, it focuses very heavily on MSF, which is not really a topic on the exam.It has a lot a practice questions, and although I could consistently answer 90% of these correctly, I found myself failing the actual test. None of the questions I encountered on the exam had anything to do with the book.If you're looking for a book to help you in passing the exam, this is not the one."
1,confusing organization,Very difficult to understand. hard to tell what is important and the key ideas to know. The book has been essentially worthless for my study.
1,This book is not good for preparing 70-100,"It is a book about MSF, but not a book helping you in the real exa"
1,Has nothing to do with the actual exam,I've bought this book and have been reading it to prepare for 70-100 exam. It turned out that none of the questions on the actual exam were at least similar to those discussed in this book. The only thing the book may be good for is to learn terminology and project management flow charts (which are already outdated). Overall resume this is waste of money.
2,Informative but not helpful with regard to the test,"The test didn't have any questions what-so-ever concerning any of the Microsoft Solution Framework Models. It was comprised of: 1.Many case studies, each with many multi-answer responses (trickey) derived only from infomation concerning the business problem in the case study (no enlightened info from the 662 pages of reading this book). 2.The development of file structure keys and attributes for databases associated with case studies, the trick being that these databases file structures weren't discussed in the case studies at all so you had to guess what the field names meant and how they were to be used. 3. A flow diagram thing that I couldn't get to work properly at all (You had to click two boxes at-a-time then click a connecting phrase to make a flow diagram). I'd like to see the mental giant wonder boy that could pass that piece of technowork using any of these study guides. I'm going to get transcender."
1,Great information in a totally inaccessible format,"This book (with a nod and wink to the late and lamented Douglas Adams) had to be written by a Vogon. All of the information you could need is in there, but getting it from the page into your mind is incredibly painful.I will admit that, as an independent Business Analyst, I respect this book for its ability to drive my potential competitors screaming into the night and thereby reducing the number of people bidding for my contracts."
1,I have stopped reading this after 4 chapters,The book mostly centers around what ever MSF models are there taking each one and coming back to it again and again.. Just do the exercises to feel that you have made use of the money pumped in to buy this
1,Nothing From This Book Helped Me!,Took the test today and discovered that this book provided me with absolutely no help what so ever. Needless to say I failed. There was not one example test on the CD that even came remotely close to immulating was was on the actual exam! I wish there was a book I could recommend but I haven't found it yet.
2,Jumped the gun.,"I just did the exam.This is a good book, and after you ignore the first 5 chapters it DOES follow the current sylabus.But it has nothing to do with the exam.It is unfortunate, and I can see where the authors are comming from, by assuming it would follow the old WOSA exams on MSF. It is an interesting book, and I really feel I benefited from it.I passed the exam, but really used my experience, and about 10 pages from this book."
1,Don't Don't Don't buy this book for 70-100 Exam,This book does not prepare you in any way shape or form for 70-100. The test is totally unrelated to the information in this book. The Microsoft test is completely subjective and not based on facts from any book. Beware!
1,I don't think so.,"Having just flunked the exam miserably after studying all 3 books currently available, only one three is only marginally helpful, and this ain't it. Try Ezzell's book by Sybex."
3,Too much Microsoft-Specific Stuff?,"Uh, it is a Microsoft test, about using Microsoft methods to implement Microsoft solutions. Call me crazy, call me a dreamer, but maybe that's why it has a lot of Microsoft-specific stuff."
1,Useless!!,"Not one word I read from this book helped me on the exam. Easily the most worthless ""study"" guide ever!"
1,"Not just worst computer text, worst textbook on any topic.","The book is poorly organized and filled with distracting errors in grammar and usage, such as ""regiment"" for ""regimen"". In some cases the errors are so severe that they prevent the text from making sense. There is a large amount of apocryphal material, often designated as such by the authors. Many of the answers to the exercises and test questions are incorrect."
1,Not recommended for exam preparation,"This book is an - indepth overview of MSF. Too bad MSF has nothing to do with exam 70-100. If the book title was ""An Overview of MSF"" I could probably give it 2.5 to 3 stars.The Sybex book isn't much better, but I've always found their MCSD books to be somewhat lacking in comparision to their MCSE titles.The Mastering Distributed Application Design and Development using Microsoft Visual Studio 6 Student Workbook is the best resouce I've come across for the test so far. It's a pretty fair overview of the Analysis process ala Microsoft."
1,This Title is Way Off of the Mark,"If you waste your time reading this book in order to study for the 70-100 certification exam, you will be well and truly sorry.The vast majority of this book is concerned with teaching readers about Microsoft's recommended methods of project management and writing white papers. the exam, on the other hand, focuses on case studies, project design (high level), and relational database design.If you need a study guide for this exam, look elsewhere. It is a shame too, as other books in this series have been very useful."
1,No need to read this book to pass the exam,"I used this book to prepare the exam, but not a single question on the topic discussed in the book. I am really dissapointed with the book. Luckily I tried the free sample of exam from the transcender website and I got some idea about the exam."
2,Too Much Blah-Blah-Blah,"I have to agree with the reviewers above who described this book as slow, wordy, and redundant. I also agree that the ""hero"" comes across as whiny baby. From page 50 - 150 one exciting thing happens and the rest of it is the hero feeling sorry for himself and wondering in circles about what is going to happen next. I have proven to myself for the third time that I just don't get Cherryh."
4,Great author,"I have read all of Cherryh's books; some of them several times. She does use a lot of conjecture, repetition and introspection; but, to me, I enjoy her books so much I'll overlook that part. I don't think she is easy to read, and her books do take concentration. Some series are much better than others, but that's the way with any author."
2,"80% whine, 15% fiction, 5% science","all throughout the book, the main protagonists just keep whining and whining and whining. each chapter is a rehash of the protagonist navel-gazing, wondering why anyone would ever want to assassinate him. a snail moves faster than this book's plot. and then at the last 20 pages, the book suddenly gains an urgency you never thought was there. it was like a hack writer nearing his maximum word count!i read the other reviews and said the story gets better as the series goes on. i'm like, my God! for their sake i hope it does! if i haven't read their review i would never even think of picking up another Cherryh book again (this is the 1st Cherryh book i've read)"
3,Almost!,"I'd give this 7/10 if I could. Cherryh manages to make a believable almost human race out of the atevi, while avoiding anthropomorphizing them. The atevi aren't human, that is apparent at the beginning of the book and the end.Having that barrier between the atevi and the lead, Bren, leads to some interesting circumstances. However, ultimately Bren comes across as unbelievable and difficult to relate to, both because he doesn't relate to other humans at all during the course of the book, and because he's a bit bland.Ultimately the difficulty in connecting with the characters in the book both broke my immersion and made the book interesting, because it was done so well with the atevi, but I didn't feel a connection with Bren. It may just be that I've been immersed in first person high fantasy and the third person limited perspective sci-fi didn't connect with the character in the same way.Verdict: Read it."
2,This series is part of the reason I don't read Cherryh,"I have been a great fan of Cherryh over the years, but I think her books are now suffering from the availability of word processors; the material does not seem to justify the number of pages. If she cut down the number of pages, I think the books would be more fun to read. I just get tired of wading through the meaningless material. The story is good, just too much work to get to. There are much more engrossing authors, so I am now avoiding her books."
2,Too Much Interior Head Talk,There are some cool non-human life-forms in the novel and I'm sure that I would like them much better if they would do away with the brainless human who is the main character. He thinks and talks to himself endlessly and therefore becomes a pain in the neck to the aliens and the reader. I finished this one out of a sense of duty and dogged determination.
3,Too Wordy,"The meat of the tale is well laid out by the top reviewer. However, the editors at DAW should take care to preserve quality in the books they publish. This story is good and Cherryh is a talented writer, but here she has fallen into the trap so many famous-old-time-science-fiction writers have fallen into..... too many words, too much ""remembering"" and not enough meat to chew on to keep one awake late into the night. C.J., please cull your own manuscripts since the editors don't seem to be doing the job anymore for any of the authors. All the reviews so far have been quite accurate, and if you have read this far, you know very well what kind of book this is."
2,It takes 300 pages to get interesting.,"This book is incredibly wordy and redundant. It had a typical ""mystery"" beginning where a character has an attempt made on his life, and his bodyguards and protectors keep him in the dark as much as possible throughout the rest of the novel. In most stories the character manages to piece together some information about the attempt on his own life. Not in this book, however, as nothing is revealed until 300 pages into the story. Prior to that we get a diary of an individual who is conducting a rather lengthy and boring cultural study of a wanna-be feudal Japan. Also, the ending never had a full, final explanation to what was going on. In short, this book was short on action and heavy on cultural didactic, and, as a result, it was extremely boring."
2,"A fine start, but disappointing in the end","I was intrigued by the beginning of this book. The alien race is very well set up and the premise is interesting. As the plot resolved, however, I found the characters and the political premise becoming more and more implausible. After about the hundredth time the main character bemoaned the fact that he (whose job it was to understand the alien race) didn't understand the alien race, I was too annoyed with him to enjoy the rest of the book."
1,Very Cute,"When I first seen this on Amazon, I thought wow.now that I've rcvd it, I still say wow, it's really cute, now all I have to do is buy a picture frame for it, It was packaged well.No complaints from me."
5,Entrancing,"I strongly prefer Disc 1 of this 2 CD set, both its Rainforest Suite & Sea Suite being equal favorites. They're suitable for relaxing background music, or falling asleep by. Each piece is about a half hour long. If you don't hear anything at first, wait...the tiny cricket sounds of the Rainforest Suite gradually rise in volume and fall into the background of gentle musical notes. The ocean in the Sea Suite comes up in gradual washings of the shore. Some ways into the piece there are haunting notes reminiscent of whale song.I've loaned/given these as gifts regularly, and the receivers have been captivated.Disc 2 I am not so keen on, but know a few people who do like it. I find the sound effects distracting and the sudden change of tone (threatening stormy undertones to outright happy rain/rainbow)annoying."
1,AXAMENTA - THE WORST EVER,"LA UNICA CANCION RESCATABLE Y ESO PORQUE LA CANTA TOTALMENTE EL VOCALISTA DE PAIN OF SALVATION ES THRENODY FOR AN ENDLING, TODO EL ESTILO DE ELLOS, ES UNA EXCELENTE CANCION, LASTIMA DEL RESTO DEL DISCO PORQUE REALMENTE ES UNA PORQUERIA, SOLO PARA FANATICOS DEL RUIDO Y LOS GRITOS INNENTENDIBLES. ES LA CANCION MAS CARA QUE HE COMPRADO EN MI VIDA, NO LO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA."
2,Not that great,"I bought this because I wanted a simple natural body wash. I use many Toms of Maine products and like them, but I won't get this body wash again. It feels the same as using a bar of regular soap. It leaves that tight, residue-y feeling and actually burns sensitive areas."
3,Not what I expected,"I have switched to SLS free products and at first I have to admit I didn't like the way I smelled after bathing. The after odor reminded me of the hand soaps used in public restrooms. But that quickly fades and my skin does not feel as sticky or dry as it did with other commercial brands of body wash. Then I remembered it is not full of the perfumes that make them so appealing to the nose. It delivers, but be prepared for a funny odor."
2,Very bad radio,"I was very disappointed. First, it's too thick to be a travel radio. Next, the snooze button does not work when you wake up to the radio mode but only to the beep alarm."
3,"Not Bad, But Shallow","When you have a one volume commentary on the entire bible, you should expect it should be shallow. The introductions to many of the books are good, but the actual commentary is very shallow. If you can afford it, I would recommend trying something along the lines of theBible Expo Gutterwrap 6vol Set. If you can afford both, then I would add this.The book introductions are great in regard to background information and makes it worth the $20 price I paid for it. I would not recommend paying much more than that though."
5,Love but too pricey!,Love this product but the price is horrible! The same product is half the price at Walgreen's unfortunately they were out and this was the fastest way of getting it.
2,Backache? Shoulder Pain? Ouch!,"Well, it does work to help keep you regular. I read another review where the reviewer stated he was having backache problems. I thought, no way! I'm here to tell you, yes, it can! I started out ok with this, but over time (a week or so) I began having lower backache and even my shoulders/neck were hurting. I stopped taking this and it all disappeared. Weird, but true. If not for the those side effects, I would have stayed with this. I'm back to a psyllium based product, which isn't as easy to drink, but doesn't cause me pain."
2,Not as good as Fiber Sure,I used Fiber Sure for years. About two years ago I couldn't find it anywhere. I finally tracked it down on Soap.com. I started buying my paper products there (your order ship free for $39+) Early this year it was no longer available. There isn't anything wrong with Clear & Natural except it doesn't mix well in anything ice cold. C&N serves its purpose. It's just like marrying a nice guy after your soul mate dies.
3,Works but Gassy,"I've been using Benefiber for years until it was recalled and forced me to look for other water dissolvable clear fibers. I was glad to find Metamucil makes this now. It does dissolve in water clearly, and helps my bowel movements like Benefiber does. However it makes me very gassy. I take 1-2 table spoon every morning empty stomach, by noon I will have a bowel movement if not earlier, but in the afternoon I become very gassy all the way until evening. I've been using it for a week. I'm not sure if this will get better or not."
4,"Doesn't ""dissolve in everything"" as miraculously as it says","Seems to work well, but I keep trying to mix in into oatmeal and it tends to clump/crystallize together. Other than that, seems as expected."
3,Not easy on Stomach,PROS: It dissolves very quickly without any tastes. It is Natural (no Chemicals)CONS: Not easy on Stomach.Although I like this product but I have to look for something different
5,No taste or glob and it works,The only fiber powder that my son will drink. Mixes easily in liquids and in undetectble. Very hard to find in drugstores and it's a decent price here.
3,Has an unfavorable taste.,"Metamucil gets 3 Stars because it has a rather distasteful flavor. ...My only comparison to this product is against Benifiber, which in contrast has almost no taste. I'm personally hesitant to cook with Metamucil because I'm worried about adding its' odd flavor into my food. I wouldn't put it in ""plain water"" either. Other than its subtle-taste, Metamucil functions as expected. I'm sure it goes well with coffee, or juices.I'll probably avoid Metamucil in the future, unless its on discount, or there's nothing else available :\ The taste isn't that severe, but it's def noticeable. ...5 Stars if just judging its ability to dissolve; I think I'll probably just do the smart thing and start eating real foods that have actual fiber in them -- these dissolving powders are just lazy and I question their long-term benefit to my health."
3,It's good but too much can cause stomach pain,"Too much inulin, which is what Fibersure now known as Clear & Natural is, can cause severe stomach pains and in me, it also caused back pains. Inulin is in a lot of processed foods and I already got it in Yoplait Yoplus so taking it once more, note not the 3 x a day Metamucil recommends, caused me occasional stomach cramps and daily back pain which I didn't connect with the fiber at all. Then one day I took a second dose & that night had pains very severe which made me go out on the internet looking for info. I found a study just out in July, 2010 which confirmed it can cause stomach pain in some people. I've completely quit taking Clear & Natural because I love the yogurt and that's enough for me. I just know there are other people like me taking it & hurting and not connecting the dots.A little fiber is good, a lot isn't & everyone has a tolerance level. I can't even take 2 doses a day.Just a heads up!!"
1,"No such product as ""Fibersure"" anymore.","FYI -- Fibersure is now called, ""Metamucil Clear & Natural."" check with the manufacturer!"
1,Not worth the money or time.,"I'm a horror nut. I love strange old movies as well. I was really looking forward to this disc only to be severely disappointed. The first movie is a slightly atmospheric but ultimatly mundane Jack The Ripper story. The second film, ""Secret of the Red Orchid"" is the film that features Mr. Lee and Mr. Kinski. It is absolutely atrocious. It's horribly dubbed; Christopher Lee is dubbed. It's a low budget gangster film that isn't worth more than 99 cents."
3,Seems well built but too small,"I purchased this for someone else who is 6 foot tall and not overweight yet the top strap was too short, could not reach around.However I did get feedback that it seems like a well designed and built brace. It's just too small apparently for someone 6' tall."
2,Ehh,"For me, it was way to hot, it did not breathe like I thought it would. I also wore it under jeans and it bunched up and actually pinched my leg and hurt. The Velcro does not stay in place. I am of average height and of average weight."
5,Respectful Parenting in the Early Year Pays Off for Lifetime,"Joanne Baum teaches moms and dads the importance of parenting with respect and empathy for a child's needs. Baum convincingly drives home her point that with the insights and lessons learned in her book, along with a bit of conscious daily effort, more cooperation, self-esteem and joy will blossom for your child and you. As parents learn to understand what is behind the behavior of their child, they are building a solid foundation of understanding and communication between parent and child. That is the key to success in future years for a well-adjusted, healthy, happy child. In addition, this philosophy simultaneously enables a parent to heal their own personal histories. Highly recommended for the first 3 years."
3,not up to WS Par,"This book is not up to the standard of the other WS books. The characters lack depth. You don't feel as much a part of them as you do in River God, Sunbird, etc. The yarn is good but but not as believable as others Smith has written. The story falls flat in the middle because of an unnecessary move from Africa to Tiawan. It's still a fun read so don't give up."
3,Contemporary Tale of Greed,A typical tale of economic gain balanced against the ecology and a bygone way of life. A novel says much of the times that we are in. Greed and personal gain at someone else's expense.Not one of my favorite Wilbur Smith books but in the top half.
4,Simply Amazing,"Other reviewers have said it is not up to par with River God, also by Smith, this is true, but River God was a masterful piece of writing that places itself as one of my favorite books ever. Elephant Song is still an exceedingly well written novel with a well thought out storyline. Many of the scenes invoke rage and disgust, while the scenes such as that which gives the book its name create emotions of deep loss and sadness. This book is not an environmentalist reader, though it does have strong themes of it, nor is it a conservationist reader, though it has strong themes of that as well. Overall if you're looking for a Wilbur Smith novel, you already know what you're looking at. If you're new to his writing but you want something with greed, murder, corruption and righteous revenge, all while looking after the environment, this book has it in spades."
5,Visit my Wilbur Smith page!,"This book and the other 20+ books that Wilbur Smith haswritten are incredible. I have a website dedicated to Smithat www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/wilbur.htmlIf you are a big fan also please visit, and make sure youe-mail me"
5,Pigs Rock!,This is a great book that teaches the youngest kids about music and rhyme. It's an easy read for 2-4 age group. Daughter and I love the funny illustrations of those rockin pigs! Its a great addition.
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the other 1 star reviews. He can be very funny - I bought the DVD becauseof one of his other very good CDs. This one is full of weak attempts at humor that became sotiresome that a friend and I just decided not to waste our time, after seeing over a halfhour of it. Weak material, and even the penis jokes weren't funny."
5,"If you like raw humor, Ron's your man!","Not for the faint of heart or the politically correct. But if you're into In-Your-Face kind of humor, give this one a try! I laughed until my sides hurt."
3,Good stuff,"What is wrong with you guys?!? Maybe not as good as some of his earlier stuff, but still funny. In a world of Bill Mahr, David Spade and other idiots, Ron White is a master. I laughed so hard a few times I couldn't catch my breath. Thank you, Ron!"
5,"""It's a Petticoat."" ""Yeah, Well I can see the junction.""","Following up his hit DVD ""They Call Me Tater Salad"". Ron White's ""You Can't Fix Stupid"" is ten times more hilarious; Ron White's comic genius grows with every DVD/CD he puts out. Here we have Ron White talking about his new wife Barbra, at one point Courtney Love, his honeymoon in Greece, the effects of a period on one's sex life, ""Petticoat Junction"", you name it...Ron White makes a joke about it. I think that next to George Carlin, Ron White is the most talented and funny comic around today. The man's got a great way of telling jokes and almost every joke is a hit. If you're at the video store and want to rent something that will make you laugh your a$$ off, you can't go wrong with this DVD...And if you can, you're stupid. And you can't fix that.GRADE: A+"
2,Good but now as good as expected.,I enjoyed the extras where Ron talks about his beginning better than the actual DVD. It is good but not GREAT. I expected GREAT based on what I've seen of Ron elsewhere.
5,Love it!,Ron White is hilarious. His skits are really funny and the looks on his face are just perfect. Makes for great entertainment!
2,"Ahhhhhhhh, don't bother!",I really liked Ron White's many short acts that I've watched and hoped this titled performance would have been just as good but he bombed for most of his act. If you have nothing better in mind to watch give it shot but you'll be thinking about finding something else to entertain you shortly into this feature.
1,You can't fix hick.,"Absolutely horrible, even for lowbrow comedy standards. It's made me feel like my intelligence was being sucked out, and i even started thinking budwiser was good, and trailers were sexy and sleek. If you want real, intelligent comedy look up Bill Hicks you won't be disappointed."
3,not as good as Blue Comedy Tour,"This was ok, not as good as the Blue Comedy Tour stuff. Maybe that is because it is many of the same jokes as on the Blue Comedy Tours. There are a few jokes that are the same with a little bit of a different twists. It's not a DVD that I have watched more than once."
3,I agree with the consensus: 3 stars,"Ron White can be very funny, but this DVD is not his best work. It's a 43-minute show that he did last year (2005) and while it has some funny moments it's not that great overall. [...] And once or twice it appears that the scotch he's always sipping on has gotten to him a bit. Worth watching for a few quick laughs, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,Only moderately funny,"This DVD has a few good laughs but isn't nearly as good as listening to ""Drunk in Public."""
2,Stupid Ain't Funny,"Save your money. This disk is raunchy (that's how Ron White is), but it's also not very funny, and it's quite short (43 minutes). If you've seen ""Tater Salad"", you've already seen a lot of the jokes, and the new ones just aren't making it. White's a very funny guy, but he needs some good new ideas."
3,Funny...but dry on the outside,"Ron White has always struck me as a funny comedian, and when I heard Drunk IN Public I was hooked on what could be a great comedian so instantly when i saw Cant Fix Stupid I bought it right away expecting that same outrageous comedy I heard on his Cd but was slightly dissapointed when he wasnt quite up to snuff with his new material. I do give credit to the fact he created new material, because I bought his PLatinum CD ""Call Me Tatter Salad"" Along with Comedy Centrals ""Southern Gents Of Comedy and saw that his skits and Comedy were the same on both DVD;s and his Cd, so I was a little dissapointed he had nothing new but in this new DVD Cant Fix Stupid Ron comes out with BRAND NEW Material, and its not terrible, it is funny but I have heard alot fo Dane Cook recently and you just cant compared to the SUFI Master. However I will keep this DVD and throw it in from time to time when I want to hear some crude Southern Texas Humor"
1,Big disappointment,"After seeing Ron on Comedy Central we thought he was very funny and even planned to go see him live. I ordered this DVD for my wife as a gift and was extremenly disappointed after the first 30 minutes. The gratuitous sex, immature garbage and profanity was offensive and not funny. Forget the gutter language and get back to funny. I would have returned the DVD if possible. Don't waste your money."
1,Can't compare to other Entertainers,"We bought this DVD because it was recomened in the ""others who bought this product also bought"" category - this Comedian can't compare to the quality of Jeff Durham's Arguing with Myself - it's a different level entirely and boring."
2,Confused Euro-Horror,"This is a very incoherent movie. There are all kinds of continuity glitches. For example, when Christa is trying to seduce Lenda, she's wearing shorts. Then she takes Lenda down to the vaults for a more comprehensive ... encounter, and suddenly she's wearing slacks. In another scene, two women flee from the castle and are then attacked by the villagers as suspected witches, while the background switches from day to night and back again without any rationale. There are several silly side-plots involving the guests at the castle that have nothing to do with the main ""story""--whatver that is. Really, this is a one star movie, but the presence of Rita Calderoni and Mickey Hargitay pushes it up to two stars. ""The Devil's Nightmare"" from Redemption is a much better example of Euro-horror cinema."
3,Bizarre&provocative,"Polselli go back to his beloved theme of vampirism, with this visionary movie,shooted in the gothic castle of his first horror movies,yet telling the story in the lively, sexually explicit style which was now the constant in his making movies.Polselli's style is here: his surreal spirit is applied in this horror in a provocative and bold way."
5,Best Photo Book of Washington DC,"Anyone who has grown weary of the typical DC monument pictures will love this book, with its gorgeous black-and-white photos of less commonly photographed buildings and places in DC. It's a sophisticated photo book of DC, one that you can give friends who actually live in DC and are tired of all the same old same old, or it makes a great gift for people visiting DC for the first time as well, or who have never been to DC. It's a DC photo book with a flair, the best one I've seen."
5,beautiful black and white architectural photography,"I am a fan of architectural photography and when I came across this book at the Hirshhorn, I couldn't leave without it. As other reviewers have stated, these are not your typical ""tourist"" shots of DC. This book features unique perspectives of architectural details you might normally miss. It has certainly become an inspiration for me to make more trips to the city with my camera!"
1,The Price Gougers from Hamburg,"Reader, this early digital recording is more vitreous than glass. With a playing time of barely 40 minutes, it is Deutsche Grammophon at its most pinchgut. Nor does the music-making necessarily surpass the earlier traversalsFamous Ballet Music ~ Gaté Parisienne, The Sleeping Beauty, Coppélia, Les Sylphides / von Karajan, Berlin PO&Offenbach: Gaite Parisienne & Ballet Music from Faust, Aida, La Gioconda, Prince Igor.Until our Germanic friends remaster this recording and drop its price accordingly, don't abet their cupidity."
5,ruby baby,"quite possibly one of björk's best releases to date. a must have for the die hard björk fan! i call ging glo 'the coffee shop cd', simply because i can totally picture it being played in a coffee shop. it is very upbeat, and jazzy.. and while she is singing in icelandic in all the songs minus the last two, it is still very enjoyable, very fun, very björk!"
3,3.33 -- miss versatility from outer space does jazz with dad,"Yes, these are all jazz and show covers. Except for a few songs on the end done in English, everything else is sung in beautiful Icelandic. Bjork really shows off her voice on this disc with all of the amazing idiosyncratic quirks and perks she can wow us with. This disc is a worthy purchase for fans of Miz Gudmundsdottir's vocal talent and spirit and your everyday icelandic performance of jazz standards. ;)"
1,*** Bad Product - NO BUT IT ***,"I bought this product for my daughter's christmasgift, but, the worse buying that i do in my life. The product is bad quality, from 24th December until yesterday (14th January) i can not transfer music files to this device. All PCs -freeze- where i was trying to transfer any file, i am very sad for this poor gift. I recommend you, save money and buy an iPod, more money.. but best product. Good, nice & cheap not apply for this product. NO BUIT IT."
5,Swingset Jazz,"Swingset Jazz contains the most sophisticated jazz renditions of favorite childrens songs I have ever heard. Michael Friedman has succeeded in creating a CD that the kids will have trouble wrestling back from their jazz-loving parents. Road trip music has an entirely new meaning! I could easily write about each and every song but I will try to be brief. The flute, piccolo and pure whistling talents of Nelson Rangell are remarkable. The fun, joyous vocals of Robert Johnson in Music Island and This Old Man are magical. The sax talents, especially the soprano sax fun of Stephen Watts is pure joy. And ALL of the bass guitars of Michael Friedman are perfect.The joy of ""If You're Happy and You Know It"".Get the CD. You'll immediately understand."
3,"Good info, but missing something important...","Others have mentioned it in their reviews, but I can't help but echo them: There are no maps in this book! It took me two minutes to google several maps that showed WW1 Europe. Yet an almost $20 book didn't have a single map. This is particularly disappointing since I have previously read WW2 for Dummies, and was pleased to find several maps and diagrams that made things so much clearer. Were there a WW1 for Dummies, I'd have to recommend that. Instead, I just have to recommend that if you buy this book- print a map to go with it."
1,the ONLY picture in this book is on the cover,This book has no photos in it at ALL. Nothing but text.The section on Airplanes and tanks is maybe three pages.
4,Great overview of an often forgotten war,"This book was a great overview of a war that is often forgotten in the shadow of World War II. What I liked about it the most was that it was balanced in the amount of treatment it gave to the background treaties and politics, the major battles, the major players, the new technology, the mistakes, etc. The first book on WWI I tried to read overly reflected the author's own focus on battle tactics, etc. to the neglect of the whys. This book was much more balanced. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that, like others pointed out, there were no maps. Given there were photos and charts, I'm sure the publisher is capable of printing non-text items. For an epic war that involved two major fronts, and major powers such as Germany, France, Russia, England, the US, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Greece, Turkey, etc. and saw action in the Middle East and Africa as well as Europe proper, I can't understand why they would have zero maps. It was still worth it however."
5,Let your soul be saved,"Sister Gertrude Morgan is a great self-taught evrnacular artist and evangelical preacher. Seek out her art. Listen to this recording of her street gospel performances.If it doesn't save you, you'll at least know why some folk give themselves over to an old message and an impassioned believer such as Ms. Morgan"
1,no cd inside case,"i received the cd, but there was no actual cd inside of it. a little difficult to review with no cd to listen to. happy holidays."
5,Water Water Everywhere,Mr Pinnock has provided us with the definitive Water Music using authentic period instrmentation and tempos. Disconcerting to people used to the more familiar larger orchestral versions but this is probably more along the lines of what the composer actually had in mind for the music.
2,"TOO ""business-like""","Obviously, original instruments is the only way to go when it comes to baroque music, and compared to the recordings of, say, Gardiner and Harnoncourt, this one is stodgy and, as Mr. Libbey put it, ""business-like."" As usual, Pinnock and the English Concert produce a nice sound, but the tempos are too slow (for a period performance recording) and the reading just plain dull. The Harnoncourt recording, on the other hand, may be a little too mannered and fast at times, but Gardiner finds a good middle ground."
3,Better options,"Gardiner work is also done on period instruments but is much more alive without being heavy handed. Pinnock's version is nice, butyou can do better."
4,RM views,I have a number of research methods texts. This handbook by Jane is very well written and very easy reading. Text communicates research methods very clearly. Great for beginners and advanced users
1,Not the size advertised,"The dimensions above ""8.2 x 5.9 x 3.5 inches"" are grossly inaccurate. The absolute longest side is a little shorter than 5 inches. I needed something closer to the size advertised and I was very disappointed."
4,CIM 654 Storytelling in Org,Book purchased for class it was dirt-cheap for used copy looked new and shipped timely. What more is there to say.
3,Good book with some good thoughts but not earthshattering,"I good book for those interested in hearing from these four people about their experiences with storyteling and narrative in an organiation. I found Stephen Denning and Larry Prusaks stuff interesting, although I had already heard the Denning story in other book, he did provide additional insight I found helpful. Found John Seely Browns stuff to be difficult to read with not a lot of value, although there were one or two nuggets. If you are doing a deep dive on storytelling in organizations, good book to get or if you want multiple viewpoints good too."
4,Delightfully Entertaining!,"This was my first book by P.G. Wodehouse. The moment I finished, I was back on Amazon to find other books written by this author.Quick wit and rapid-fire dialogue, reminded me of old movies with Cary Grant, Spencer Tracey & Katherine Hepburn.. to mention a few. A great read."
2,Not Such Big Adventures for Sally,It was the author's name that interested me in reading this book. I have found it to be very simplistic and its lack of sophistication probably more appropriate for a young adult.
1,No humor at all,"Not one laugh in the entire book. I am not surprised it has not been published in the US until the Overlook edition. Truly bottom of the barrel. Wodehouse is wonderful, elsewhere."
3,Not the best of P.G.wodehouse,I Have read several of his books and am a great fan of his. But this one or some reason was not as humorous as the others. However I did thoroughly enjoy the book.
3,A Tad Disappointing,"This is early Wodehouse, written in the first part of the twenties. His writing, as a stylist, is marvelous even at this point. But, you can tell that he hasn't quite gotten his footing yet. The marvelous turns of phrase are infrequent. They are the pip and they are wonderful howlers when they come. However, not quite up to form. The plot is a bit plodding and overly-dramatic. Our male antagontists difficulties are poignantly ""real life."" Not the witty fun you expect in a Wodehouse novel. (For instance, Sir Roderick Spode) Finally, our male hero absolutely lacks charm. While we delight in Bertie Wooster's dim-wittedness, here Wodehouse doesn't convince us as to why the protagonist ought to win Sally over. OK, Sally may found him appealing. But, we don't."
2,Never came with ice packs,"Well, it's ok otherwise. Sent it back and anger came without ice packs. Larger to carry than I had hoped for."
2,Did not receive this order,I was looking for this Lee Kum Kee brand but instead I received the Knorr brand which is not the one I ordered. It would have been nice to receive the brand that I actually wanted and ordered since it does make a difference when you are cooking.
1,Size problem,I cannot tell if this product is any good because the size on the package was way too small for actual fit. I wish I had known because now I have a case of something that cannot be used.
2,Good techno? For sure. Korn? No #@$&*%^ way.,"For you people into techno and the like, this C.D. will be straight up your alley: loads of thump and strange dub sounds, and plenty of repetative drum machine racket. If you're a KoRn freak such as I, this C.D. isn't worth the cheap plastic it's printed on. Now I realise a fair amount of heavy bands, such as Pantera and Black Sabbath, have been technoed before, and to alright acclaim, but I'm not sure this is the way to go with KoRn's music. Their distinctive style and groundbreaking techniques are an island to themselves, and no-one should mess with it - EVER! Techno is good on its' own, metal is good on its' own, but it will take a better effort than this to successfully combine the two into something worthwhile and progressive. Unless you're a serious collector or obscure German techno freak, leave this one alone."
3,"It's a part, it works","My radiator fan in my 1991 civic quit turning on, applying 12v to the motor turned it on, replaced this, and now it's worked fine ever since. It was a royal PITA to remove the old one."
4,Understated Excellence,"Perlman is 38 years old on this splendid recording of the Vienna Philmarmonic with James Levine conducting. The Deutsche Grammophon digital recording allows Vienna's perfection to remain a warm understated backdrop, further highlighting Perlman's vibrant melodic playing."
1,A despicable recording,"If you're thinking about getting a great recording of Mozart's two most famous violin concertos, this would be one of the last on my list. It completely lacks the character and grace Mozart had intended in these pieces. The music often drags, and there is no brilliance in Perlman's playing at all. For the definitive recording, get Arthur Grimuaux's complete recording of all five Mozart violin concertos with Philips."
5,"Hey, Paul's not so bad!","I approached reading about Paul with a bad attitude.I kinda like the guy now - Marion Soards is brilliant! Some of the bad rap that Paul has gotten is just that - a bad rap.Thanks, Dr. Soards"
5,Great Reference,The book is well worth having is one's library. It could easily be used as material for a Bible study.
3,Beltmaster Review,The belt was what I expected for the price. Not the highest quality leather but for the cheap price you get what you pay for.
4,"Great story, just not quite finished","Wonderful reading! Unfortunately, Mrs. Wiggins passed away before this edition was published. She must have intended to write more about Martha & Abram and the others, judging from the seemingly unfinished plots at the end of the 4th book."
2,More like a bombardment of a history lesson,"I was very disappointed with this book and although I'm still reading it I'm having a difficult time getting through it.I was reading a blog of an english gal (Ann Wilson titled ""Through Europe and Beyond"" on crazyguyonabike web site) who is presently doing what Ann Mustoe did and she was inspired to do it by Ann Mustoes book.I was so engrossed with the other gals blog, enjoying her adventures and many pictures and thought Ann Mustoes book would be similar but instead you're being fed a history lesson with very little of her bicycling adventures. It leaves you wanting but if you like history this is the book for you, she gives it to you lock stock and barrel till it comes out of every pore. On and on paragraph after paragraph of history. This is truly not what I was looking for. I was thinking a bit of history intertwined in her cycling odyssey but instead got the opposite ""A bit of cycling intertwined in a history book."
1,Two hundred pages of boredom,This is a great book if you are an insomniac. Read a few pages and you'll go right to sleep. A compilation of random inconsequential historical facts with little to say about cycling.
5,A must-have for the wine lover who is not a snob,"The balance of welcome humor and extensive knowledge behind the writing of this entertaining guide makes it worlds above most other books on wine, which typically shut out the everyday eater and drinker with stuffy language and crusty style. It actually makes you want to drink (which, yes, for some won't necessarily be very impressive...). You can expect to laugh and learn! An excellent gift for family, friends, and of course for yourself. *****"
4,Great tool,"Unlike the others that bought this, I like it. It will break if you haven't got a clue on how to use tools! That is why some people should just stick to paying others with skills to fix their stuff!"
1,Lyle ring compressor = junk,broke the first time I tried it and now I can not return it. ripoff for sure. the design is flawed. it breaks at the little white release handle
3,"Gets the Job Done, But Cheap","These are OK. They worked for me once, but the second time I used them, the metal piece that goes to the handle snapped off. It still works, it's just harder to use without the handle. They were inexpensive though, and got the job done."
4,"Good Movie, Bad Sub-titles","This is , as advertised, a very good movie-funny & poignant at times. Since it is in Hebrew, the sub-titles play an important role in its viewing. They are in white print, throughout the movie, which if fine for when there is a dark background, but unreadable when the background is light. Much of the dialogue is missed, & must be gleaned from context."
4,Funny Movie,"We received this movie quickly, and have watched it as a family. While slightly disappointed at the seriousness of some of the issues portrayed, overall it is a good movie to watch."
2,Max Lucado Small Group Study,"Having purchased the actual book ""Cure for the Common Life"" I did assume the study guide would work step by step with the book, but it doesn't. As a result we have not used the study guide at all, but working through the chapters one by one.I think the study guide has some good ideas, but we haven't been able to use it during our small group time, so rather a waste of money."
2,Not the best for a true group study,"This study guide is stuctured for a small group that breaks up into pairs or threes to share thoughts and personal stories to help discover each person's individual strengths. If you want to do a study based upon the book with a group that stays together and discusses together, I recommend you follow the actual book not the study guide. The book has a good list of questions at the back for chapters 6-15."
1,Very Disappointed...,"For some reason, this was the only CD player that my insurance company would cover after the CD player (which was a Pioneer) was stolen from my car. To be honest, the performance is awful. The songs sound muddy. There are separation problems, not only within frequency group, but between them. All preset EQs make the speakers sound like they're in a box, and using the manual setting doesn't fair much better. It plays a lot of CDs with a low frequency hum, and while my iPod fairs better (because it has an internal EQ) everything that comes out of the system sounds flat. In fact, it sounds like the CD player is unable to handle a great number of low and high range frequencies, and compresses them so much towards the middle that it actually causes crackling. I'm taking this back to the garage that installed it, and if they won't put in something better, I'm asking for my money back. As far as I'm concerned, this is junk!"
1,No Bass controls,There are no control to adjust Bass. I am not impressed. I am a sony guy and got fooled with this. My recommendation is not to buy this.
4,Great product for legacy D&D gamers,"I really love the content in this book. I am using it as added description in my AD&D 2nd edition game and boy is there ever great flavor text in here. Its a gem in the D&D world- a direct view into the game as it was intended. Quirky, often contradictory and fun. My only complaint was that the seller sent the product in a media envelope and the edges were damaged in the shipping. Otherwise great product."
4,Prepare you to Practice Professionally,"Bob cited each western disease and diagnosed by TCM theory (Yin-Yang, Heat-Cold, Excess-Deficiency...) then refered to TCM treatment (acupuncture points and herb formulars) for such disease. I just wishthat there should be more diseases in the book because we have many complications in real practice and couldn't find in this text. In conclusion this is a good one and if your practice is so challenging youmay find some other books that have more western diseases."
1,Not good!,I purchased two tubes of this Boat Life Lifeseal for Fiberglass and ordinarily it is a good product. I had used it before with good results but these two tubes were already partially cured...in the tube. Needless to say...I was not happy. The price was right but if the product is defective...it's not a good deal. It would cost more than the product is worth to send back so in the future I will purchase locally and squeeze the tubes before buying. The problem with buying inexpensive things on-line is the cost to ship in case a product return is needed.If the supplier reads my comments perhaps they should check their stock to ensure other tubes are not partially cured and if so...return to the manufacturer.
1,http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/james_still/,"Josh McDowell, organizer and minister to the Campus Crusade for Christ, co-wrote with Don Stewart, the infamous book _Reasons Skeptics Should Consider Christianity_. The introduction states that Reasons was ""written to give various reasons why we believe in the inspiration of the Bible as God's message to man."" Almost in anticipation of, or perhaps in guilt of their deception, the authors go on to explain that it is ""not meant to be a scholarly treatise,rather is has been written to increase the understanding of the average person."" This disclaimer should forewarn any serious reader right away, not because all arguments must be presented in some kind of highbrow ""scholarly"" manner, but because the risk for fallacy is much higher when the material is ""played down""right in the introduction. _Reasons_ scarcely addresses the real concerns of skeptics at all, and the book can hardly be called apologetic in this regard."
1,It won't work under VISTA,"I couldn't use the device as it DOES NOT operate under VISTA, and Kensington does not have a driver available for download. DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU HAVE XP OR LESS."
1,Never arrived,Waited for weeks for this to arrive; emailed the supplier; never got a response or the product.
3,Haven't I seen this before...?,"""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" is just a little too much like it's predecessors. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are carbon copies of their characters from ""Anchors Aweigh."" The plot is identical. There is really nothing of interest in the story of this musical.Does that matter? Well, not too much. Gene Kelly is so much fun to watch in ""The Hat My Dear Old Father Wore..."" that all bad plot points are forgiven. Esther Williams gets a little swimming pool scene, which is a funny nod to her claim-to-fame. Frank Sinatra gives off his boyish charm and sings some great songs. Betty Garrett is great in her role.""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" is a complete formula picture. However, the formula is pretty good and always worth a watch."
3,Betty,"If it were not for Betty Garrett, this movie would be very poor. I gave a 3 because she is so hilarious and convincing relentlessly pursuing Frank Sinatra, or ""Danny"", as he is referred to in all but the final scene. Don't buy it unless you want to see her. The other actors do just fine, however. Esther Williams seems entirely out of character here. I also find baseball boring."
3,Not bad,"I remember back when I was in college this used to be the only film from the former Yugoslavia you could find in the ""foreign"" section of any video store in the U.S. It's not a bad film, but compared to some of the really good films that came out of Yugoslavia in the last 20 to 30 years, it's rather middling. The story is set in Belgrade sometime after 1948 (i.e. after the Tito-Stalin split); the main characters are a group of teenagers (4 boys and a girl), so it's something of a coming-of-age film. Although some aspects of the plot are a bit cliched and predictable, the acting is generally very good, so the film is pleasing to watch. The depiction of life in postwar Serbia and Yugoslavia and the onset of the communist system is also quite good, and there are a number of very amusing scenes - particularly involving the `sacrifices' the boys have to make to get a pair of American blue jeans."
1,they send me damaged one,"i ordered balltube from them, but when my balltube come, i found that it already be folded, i cann't believe they can send this kind of product out."
1,USED,"I cannot tell you how disappointed I was to receive this item ""used"". How dare they send a used item and charge me the price of a new balltube. I purchased it as a birthday gift for someone in my office. When the item arrived, I did not have enough time to return it for an exchange so I went ahead and gave it after I did as much cleaning as I could to remove scratches, dust, and dirt hoping the receiver would not notice (although, I'm sure she did). The delivery service was great, but I would not trust ordering anything from this company again, ever."
4,great picking up tennis balls,"It was deformed when I got it but after few attempts of pinching the rubber, it did a great job."
3,Make one (two?) yourself fromThin Wall PVC drain pipe.,"I have only seen this type after it has worn out, so I decided to build one where the only part that can wear out is the rubber band.Cut a 10' section of thin wall PVC drain pipein half for (2) 5' pieces. My table saw with a standard blade (used carefully) worked well for this.Drill (4) 1/4' holes eqidistant around the diameter, 1/2"" to 3/4"" above the end of the pip.Use 1/2"" long (or cut down from longer) 1/4-20 (stainless steel?) machine screws and cap nuts or nylock nuts.Use one of these to fasten the bottom of the strap and a 1"" 1/4-20 screw at the top to secure the strap and hold a rubber band - to keep the balls from rolling out.A 1/4"" hole and cable tie opposite the long top screw, secures a thick rubber band, which is pulled over the long top screw.You get (2) 5' indestructable ball caddies for the price of one 4 footer."
3,It works but it has a flaw,"The flaw with the Gamma Ballhopper lies not in it's ability to pick up balls -- it does that fine. The fault lies in the strap and the connecting points for the strap. The rubber on the connecting loops at the top and bottom of the tube is thin and weak. Mine broke off after two weeks. There is now nowhere to attach the strap. I don't need the strap anyway, but it's a bit annoying. Harder plastic would be better."
5,Perfect tennis accessory and then some,We bought it for our little one to engage him when he doesn't want to hit. He can pick up balls all afternoon and never tire of it. That may not be what Gamma intended but look at it as another marketing opportunity.
2,Deceptive,"Not knowing anything about the author, I picked up this book thinking it would be an interesting sociological study in the parallels between two opposite American cultures. Rather all I found was at best, a statement of obvious observations and moral presumptions made by the author on behalf of the reader, and at times based off of clearly distorted facts or quotes. Furthermore it's unfortunate that it appears to use Christianity as its base of morality, when now more than ever both the middle class and the inner city exemplify a much greater religious diversity. Sadly, the book was no where near what I was looking for. Spending half a chapter on sexuality bashing homosexuals deals nothing with suburban or urban culture. Luckily the library will take this book back!"
1,One Star for Star,"Wow! This book is utterly ri-donk-ulous. Mistress Parker perpetrates yet another volume of sensationalist punditry upon our poor, brainwashed souls. You know, if her crazy rants weren't so boring, I could at least write this off as feelgood toilet reading. I mean, at least Rosie O'Donnel makes crazy-and-stupid entertaining for the masses. Even Nancy Grace manages to conduct this type of circus act with a little dignity and humor. Honestly, Madame Parker's points and topics are all very compelling, but she's about as convincing and about as appropriate as Al Jolsen in blackface."
1,Illogical,"The more I read this book, the more LIBERAL I became. She uses extremes to get her points across and often bashes issues without any real reasoning besides ""it's against morals"" . This book is more of a crazy author's rant than a book that someone can learn from. She puts no reason or fact behind why she believes the way she believes or why the conservative way is the way to go. She even seems racist and is just too old fashion."
1,NTSC copy sent!,"I was pretty annoyed firstly at the length of time this item took to arrive, but mostly at the fact that they'd sent me an NTSC copy rather than the PAL version."
2,A grammar translation approach to Arabic,I teach Arabic at the University of Indiana from this book. It is strict grammar translation. The material is very dry and hard for the students to comprehend. It doesn't contain much in the way of actual Arabic material. There is one short dialogue per chapter and the topic of the dialogue progresses from the University to the Office to Famous Arabic Literary figures. Using this book you would never get around to asking someone where the bathroom is or be able to talk about your family. It is best used as a grammar supplement only.
4,Excellent Value for the Money....,This is a very good case....I use it for my 160GB iPod Classic. But it also works with my Samsung Epic 4G phone that I sometimes use for streaming Pandora. It's very well built...the only thing keeping it from the full 5 star rating is the fact that it doesn't have any reflective paint (if your a jogger like me).
2,It works for smaller phones and MP3 players,"It is made of cheap material. The velcro portion of the armband is rediculous because the rough part is on both sides so when you are running, the velcro shreads your arm or sleeve when you move your arms back and fourth.....so I turned that armband portion to the front and now the MP3 player hits my side when I move my arm. Not a win win situatuion. Very cheap but if you aren't picky, then go for it."
1,BEWARE - Defective CDs! (13jan08),"This is not a review of the REAL CD because I have yet to receive a GOOD one. Two shipments of this disc have yielded PROPERLY labeled CDs (case and disc), but the tracks burned on the CD are totally wrong... some Various Artist jazz compilation. I'm trying a third time and will post the result as soon as it arrives. This is as of 13jan08."
5,Great. Just great.,"This is the performance that you can only gasp and say nothing, because it is almost perfect. Every note sounds so clear, every piece is handled in a neat structure.(A blasphemous idea: I wonder if Chopin played these pieces himself, maybe he had great poetry and aroma,but could he make a clearer sound than Pollini? )"
4,Only Pollini,"Beautifully clear.....however I feel that Chopin would have played it with more passion....expression. I love it but I meant to order Chopin's Polonaises....oh well, next time....thank you Amazon. You did well as usual."
3,"Technically 5 stars, musically 1 star","Pollini certainly can not be faulted for his execution in the recordings on this CD. But musically he does not seem to get what some of these pieces are about. No mere technical exercises, each one has a mood and feeling (or several) all its own, and IMO Pollini fails to bring these out fully. The softer Etudes such as Op. 10 No. 6, Op. 25 No. 1 and Op. 25 No. 19, for example, sound too loud and mechanical. I recommend Browning's CD on RCA--technically virtually as good, and played with a lot more feeling."
2,"Wow, these are technically impressive, but not musically","I used to think it was hilarious that people found Pollini's recording the best, but now I've realized that it is only because they haven't heard Garrick Ohlsson's recording.Ohlsson's recording of these etudes contains FAST tempos, similar to Pollini (usually a bit faster still), but he actually makes music out of them; fancy that.Pollini's interpretations sound all Forte, all emotionless/expressionless. His ""ocean"" etude (c minor) sounds like a heart attack. Ohlsson's actually sounds like the ocean. The difference is insanely noticable; check out Ohlsson's recording now.Get the Ohlsson over this. Enough said."
2,"Dangerous book, very missleading","The book is very consumable. It's easy to follow and easy to learn from. For the new to UML reader it seems like such a relief to find a book that describes it so easy. This is where the problem starts, the book is simply incorrect in a lot of cases. Some examples below:It describes the RUP as waterfall. Superimposing workflows on phases. The author thinks that the inception phase is analysis. This could essentially drive a project to failure. It's obvious the author has never successfully implemented RUP.Some of the diagrams are wrong (i.e. The extension points are on the wrong use cases) and the emphasis on diagramming use cases instead of writing them is an obvious novice mistake.Larman's Applying UML and Patterns is just as simple to read but is actually correct. Please at least review Larman's book before purchasing this terrible title."
2,OUT OF DATE : Pre UML 2.0,"Just a word of warning - regardless of whether you like this book or not, it was published prior to UML 2.0 and hence uses an old version of UML. In 2010, it's now out of date.I do wish Roff would update it, but still waiting :("
5,Excellent introduction to UML,"This book is both informative and formative.It is informative because it presents all the essentials of UML in a very friendly and detailed-enough manner.It is formative because it motivates one into using visual modeling to do real work.After spending two evenings reading the book, I was able to do my first diagrams to model an object-oriented project the very third day.The book is not for experienced users, but it puts one quickly on track and it is easy to use later as a reference."
1,"I don't find the humor in this ""sick"" product","Yes... marketing can and should be fun, but I'm not finding any humor in the way this product is marketed. Quite simply, it makes light of domestic violence. I am disgusted...Amazon should take this one off of their site."
1,What a morbid and poorly thought out product,Just the concept makes me sick to my stomach. Is violence something something to joke about? Aren't enough violence perpetrated by spouses and ex-spouses already?? Amazon should pull this off their shelves since this is a tasteless poor stab at humor. Pun intended
2,Not what you might think!,"We first saw this knife block in a store in New Zealand. We loved it then, it had a nice heavy metal base but the packing of it was too much to bring home to the U.S. So, when we found the same style of knife block on amazon.com (loftparty) we where thrilled.However, due to perhaps mass or over production of the ""Ex"" knife block, the base was now constructed out of plastic! The whole construction seemed loose, and the wearing and chipping of the silver metallic paint was inevitable. Disappointed, we promptly returned it. Now I have to live with shoppers regret."
3,only a few pages,"Thought this book would be thicker. Perhaps in my last minute shopping frenzy I didn't read the fine print, but it is much thinner than the sticker books I have purchased in the past. I would guess less than 10 pages."
3,"Sound not wonderful, Hofmann woeful","I got this back in 1990 -- the only recording of Parsifal available to me for a long while.Being a very early DG digital recording, the sound is not wonderful -- there is a lack of clarity, but it is bearable.But the biggest negative is the tenor Peter Hofmann. Sadly, his singing is woeful! He is all over the place with mile-wide vibrato. There is only one note in the whole recording (in 2nd act) which he sings properly. How DG and Karajan signed him up for a major Wagner recording escapes me.Otherwise, Kurt Moll is good and the other singers are fine. The orchestral playing is great when you can hear it clearly. But the main tenor certainly spoils the whole thing."
5,Excellent Resources for Teachers and Writers!,"I own many books for teachers of writers and this book is simply one of the best and easiest to use in the classroom. So, so, so many ideas for writing activities that it's hard to convey how useful this book is. I think it is also a great handbook for writers of all kinds to use when they need a writing exercise to jumpstart creativity or squash writer's block. Teachers of all grades, in all subjects--not just language arts--could and should have this book in their hands. Love it."
3,"Careful, gets really hot",I bought this for my new school boy to hang on his desk. It's a good light but it gets really hot and if your child touches it...ouch! Better for adult use or children who aren't curious little boys. :-)
3,It works OK,"Don't expect too much flexibility from the goose neck and it's only about 6 inches long. Clamping it on the vertical position may not work too well. The on/off switch needs some improvement. But then again, it works."
5,Subtitles,"The subtitles of the lyrics of the march ""Von Finnland bis zum Schwarzen Meer"" are mis-translated as ""From England to the Black Sea."""
3,1988 Hits,"Rock On's 1988 collection has some very strong songs that are offset by some less than stellar work. Bobby McFerrin's acapella goofy, offbeat song ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" was a surprise number one hit and walked off with the Grammies for Record & Song Of Year. Robert Palmer's ""Simply Irresistible"" is basically a rewrite of his ""Addicted To Love"", but it is an enjoyable song anyway. White Lion had a hit with ""Wait"" which is pure hair metal and Paul Carrack had a welcomed top ten hit with the sublime ""Don't Shed A Tear"". Sheriff's powerful ""When I'm With You"" only reached the lower level of the charts when it was originally released in 1982, but it hit number one in 1988 when power ballads were in vogue. Belinda Carlisle had another top ten hit with the plucky ""I Get Weak"". Expose's ""Season Change"" is pure corn, The Jets' ""Rocket 2 U"" is garbage and Johnny Hates Jazz's ""shattered Dreams"" is forgettable."
2,"good collection, bad mastering","If the Todd Rundgren selection (""I Saw the Light"") is any indication, this album was mastered directly from transferred polystyrene 45 rpm 7"" discs. I've owned many versions of ""Something/Anything?"" (the album which contains the aforementioned song), and NONE of them sound like the mix contained on this album. So if you can overlook sound quality/fidelity, then I guess this would be an OK collection."
3,"Good print, old design","The print is a close match to the desert camo worn by the USMC, but the way the uniform is put together matches older style cammies. There is no elastic waistband and the leggings are quite loose."
4,good music for kids,"Son is a big fan of the Drake and Josh TV show, so he is thrilled with haveing Drake Bell's music as well."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","Some concepts presented here are excellent - connecting on higher Chakra levels, and the fact that men tend toward the first (sexual) Chakra, while women tend toward the third (survival) Chakra.However, the presentation leaves a lot to be desired. The book is provided as a series of (channelled) lectures. The concepts appear meandering at times, uncohesive. Particularly the 'examples' seem off base a bit.However, if you know someone with it I would say it's worth borrowing. I got some excellent insights from reading it, though I'm not sure I would recommend anyone buying it. Now, if it was out in paperback, it might be worth the cover price there."
4,One more MUST TO HAVE,"This is one more of the ROCK ON collection that an 80's collector must to add to your favorites. You'll listen some difficult songs to find in other collections like STRUT from Shena Easton, that is also one of my favorites!. If you like the 80's music, you'll enjoy it!"
4,Flint,Flint gives viewers a back stage look at what his job is. The DVD could be more enjoyable with a few more skits but was satisfying as is.
2,Do research before writing!,"I gave this book 2 out of five stars because it is informational. But the problem I found when looking at restaurants and places to stay that were in my area of the state I found many things were not right, such as spellings of names of restaurants. Also, she listed one place as only a restaurant and it is also a place to go for a weekend get away that is very neat. I only wonder about the rest of the information. It is fun to look at but I wouldn't use it as a guide when I travel to any of the places, lord knows I would probably be trying to get some place that did not exist as she had spelled it and look like a completely ""dumb"" tourist."
3,Union member takes a time trip,"A great view of a time is labor union history. If you are having a hard time making ends meet take a look at ""Deadline for Action"" when unions were working very hard to save an important idea ""price control"". It is an idea that we should be fighting for today."
5,Pet Assisted Therapy Book,A very informative well written book. I highly recommend this book if you are interested the subject matter.
5,A Silent Forest,"This DVD is a must for the consciously aware individual. With the numbers of Genetically Engineered and Genetically Modified Organisms in regard to forests growing globally, this DVD is a wake-up call. The question is, will we answer? Is it too late?Genetic Roulette: The Documented Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Foods"
1,Two failed units,Rec'd first one and it was defective out of the box. This was installed as a replacement for another Blaupunkt unit that failed (lesser model ME1). I wanted to upgrade to a one with more features (tv tuner). Second ME3 worked for a few months but has now failed when I needed it. This is three strikes. I will not purchase this brand again.
5,Japanese Classic,"This movie gives those little insights to Japanese culture that us Japophiles love. Anne Suzuki does an excellent job of expressing emotion, wonderful acting. One for the collection."
5,Chevenga's going to be back -- online,"Look for a highly-revised and expanded version of Lion's Heart (and Lion's Soul) to appear serialized online, along with the third Chevenga book, 'asa kraiya.' (Google ""Chevenga."")If you wonder how there can be a third Chevenga book... it's all explained.Why am I returning to it? I found that I hadn't yet said everything I wanted to using Chevenga as a character, and visiting his world again with the greater knowledge and maturity I had acquired in the intervening years I find I really enjoy. As well, there are some Fifth Millennium stories that Shirley Meier and I conceived that have never got into print as of yet."
1,Item recieved NOT as pictured (Not at all),The item we recived does NOT appear to be the item we ordered !!!Different SHAPE and color . .Not sure if it will even fit the application
4,Proustian decadence in Manhattan,"Davis-Vautrin has given us a gift, a novel composed of exquisite moments and glimpses. When the waitress asks the ""visitor"" if he's from out of town, he replies, ""Not yet."" A fashion model assures us that ""behind every man a woman lies."" Much hinges on a misprint in an antique copy of Bullfinch's Mythology. Myth isn't something far away in After the Moonwalk; it's a familiar guest, joining the characters in cocktail bars and in the backseat of limos. The author has read deeply into classic and forgotten texts, and rather than shoving his knowledge down our throats, he sprinkles it liberally over every setting, making the reader feel smarter and more sensitive than he or she was before starting this slim and subtle volume."
4,Good Thriller,Overall a good action/suspense type novel. Good geographical descriptions and interesting settings helped give the story a beleivable feel though I thought the ending was somewhat predictable (but still solid).The only real gripe I had was the way the two story lines were presented in alternating chapter form. The ultra short chapters (2-3 pages) really slowed down the momentum of the individual stories for me. This is a book not at episode of 24! I ended up reading 2 or 3 chapters for a given story and then going back and doing to same for the next...easy enough I guess.
5,Ordinary Mind,"It really seems, to me, that this book is different from so many dogmatic books. Many books are products of the ambitions of the frontal lobe(which is programmed to prove its importance, to itself, through the act of thinking).Hawkins is aware of all the ego trappings of the frontal lobe. All the usefullness of this book comes from Hawkin's ability to see the simple truths (such as the different fields of attraction throughout the scale of consciousness)and his agility in communicating in a simple and clear way, devoid of his own postionality.I would like to summerize my opinion about the book, but I don't think I can. I hope more people get started by reading this book.PS-A good companion book to read also is The Tao Te Ching."
4,Depth psychology integrating with depth theology!,"The integration of cradle Methodism, a bachelor's degree in science, a medical degree, three years of attempting to get heart and mind around Freudian theory of the unconscious (I was a real cynic in a mid-West psychoanalytic training school), several years of itinerate Gestalt theory and practice, Carlos Castaneda's TEACHINGS OF DON JUAN, Jungian analysis and theory along with Episcopalian liturgy; and I finally begin to grasp what Dr. Hawkins is relating. I usually have to read each of his sentences two or three times. I started from a very deep black hole of childhood depression, and it can be done. allen"
1,Seduction,"Mr. Hawkins' book gives a very seductive account of what it might be like to live the awakened life. However, the more I learn about Mr. Hawkins (the origin of his Ph.D for instance), and having listened to some of his on-line talks, the less I respect what he writes . Net-net, I won't buy anything else he does or endorses."
5,Wonderful Experience,"This is a book I couldn't put down. It was a very ""slow"" read and very difficult read for me. There's so much here that it may have been a bit overwhelming, but I was totally absorbed by this wonderful book. Very often it is hard to put certain things into words, this is one of those times.I do know that as a student of the Truth this was an important book to read and it comes with my highest recommendation."
1,poor design,The spray nozzle is directly behind the fan blades. The fan blades are large. Hence the nozzle is spraying into the rear of the blades more often than not. more water drips down the back of the blades than is blown at the user. Would make a whole lot more sense with thin fan blades.
4,Great fan for kids,"We let our two year old have this fan in his stroller at a VERY HOT faerieworlds last year and it was great. Soft blades can not hurt you and it sprays water. Kept him as cool as humanly possible in 100+ degree weather. Older kids used it too, and adults, and passers by...Just make sure you get the batteries in the right way or the blades will spin backward shooting the spray back at ya. lol"
5,Nice Fans,"I was unable to find these fans in local stores, they were perfect for two children at Disney World. It would have been nice to select the color, but fortunately I received two blue fans. The fans work well, although the water container does leak around the cap."
2,Not the best design,Much less effective and more cumbersome than the 8101 model. I bought this one to replace the 8101 I lost on vacation and as soon as I got home I ordered two replacement 8101 models.
1,Bad Packaging,Had to return the item. The fan blades are made of a soft foam and they got bent and damaged. The box had no protective material and the bottles were squeezed into too small of a box. Probably not something to buy online.
1,99 cent store broken item,"The senders left the 99 cent sticker on this and it didn't work. I don't mind paying a little more for a cheap item but this is insane, it could have at least worked for a day, maybe two but not at all.. Disappointing!"
1,Didnt work,"Immediately upon purchase, we put in new batteries, and it didn't work. Now I have to return it. I know it's cheap, but how does it not even work when it's never been used? Terrible."
1,BAD!!!,"I bought this for my son for our trip to disney. When it came in I put in 2 new batteries and it didn't work. I immediately returned this item, DO NOT BUY!"
2,Bad odds,"I ordered four fans for an upcoming trip to Disneyworld in August, I hear I'm going to need them. I received them in record time, but three out of the four were damaged...all with broken triggers. I didn't realize this at first, so as I tried to put all of the pieces together with no avail and no instructions, I examined all of them. There was only one that wasn't damaged and works. There is no fixing the others since the plastic trigger is snapped. Did Polsteins know they were broken when they put them in the box? No one initialed the packing slip. Needless to say, this did not please me. As for the fan itself...I think the concept is nice, but they're poorly made and there is only one speed...low."
1,Backwards!,"The fan blows more air backwards than forwards, which means that the mist is blown everywhere EXCEPT where the bottle is pointed. Needless to say, this design flaw rendered the product useless."
3,Great in East Africa!,"I bought my fan at my local Walmart for 7 USD. I admit is is a flimsy design. Do not expect it to pump out air like a air conditioner!! It's practical when I am in my tent, where it can get up to 90 F at night!!! I have lowered my standards. Oh....."
4,wholesale,"I am wanting quantity of 02cool 2059 squeeze breeze fan.I have a retail certificate. I am a retailer and travel to outside shows. my customer's just fry during the summer. could use large amount (if at the right price). please reply. Thank You, Brenda DeBerry"
4,1985 has Heat,"A-ha opens up Rock On's 1985 collection with ""Take On Me"" that is better known for its groundbreaking video, but is actually a catchy song that hit number one. Two of the biggest hits from television and the movies were Miami Vice and Beverly Hills Cop. Two songs appear from the later, Glenn Frey's number two hit ""The Heat is On"" and Harold Faltermeyer's instrumental number three hit ""Axel F"". Keyboard wizard Jan Hammer hit number one with the ""Miami Vice Theme"" and it is still the last instrumental to reach the top. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin hit the top ten with ""Who's Zoomin' Who"" and New Edition's scored their first top ten hit with the sugary ""Cool It Now"". The Minneapolis music scene was hot in 1985 thanks to Prince and Minneapolis natives Ready For The World hit number one with ""Oh Sheila"" which has obvious Prince influences. One of the best forgotten songs of the 80's is Sly Fox's ""Let's Go All The Way"" which has a hypnotic vibe and on point lyrics."
4,Another great 80s collection,"Again Madacy has released a fine collection of 80's cd. All of the songs from this CD are excellent and the sound quality of the cd is quite good. A must to add to your collection. I would have given this a 5 stars because I think the inclusion of General Public ""Tenderness"" prevented me to do so. I think there are more deserving songs from 1985 that should belong to the collection instead of this one. But overall it is a great cd. Highly recommended."
5,the bodyguards assignment,i am so sorry but this is another book i haven't had a chance yet but this is another author whose books i enjy reading
3,From Back Cover,"THE MISSION: WITNESS PROTECTIONBrady Morgan's objective was clear: find Grace Drummond and keep her safe until she could testify. But Brady's past with the beautiful reporter was fraught with tension and desire. Seeing her again raised unanswered questions, including why she didn't want to be found.Grace Drummond was between a rock and a hard place - and both were Brady Morgan! She was desperate to avoid testifying, but could she trust Brady with the reason? With a killer oon their tail and passion boiling beneath the surface, Brady would need all his expertise to keep Grace alive - and in his arms..."
1,No modular plugs on either end,I guess it was my fault in assuming this Modular phone wire came with modular connectors/plugs on each end. The item decription did not claim to have jack plugs so I shouldn't have assumed they were included. No problems with Amazon in getting a Quick refund for the item and I was not required to return it in order to get the credit.
3,Quicksilver - 'Live At Fieldstone' (Captain Trip),"Took me awhile to land down a copy of this Japanese import CD. Show took place on Memorial Day weekend 1997 in Healdsburg, CA. Note the sole original Quicksilver Messenger Service member here is guitarist Gary Duncan. Upside of this disc is that overall, it remonds me so much of Santana. That can be a good thing. Tracks here I was semi-impressed with were the ten-minute opener ""Voodoo Boogie"", the lengthy fifteen-minute ""Maiden Voyage"" {possible the best cut here} and maybe the so-so ""Fieldstone Shuffle"". I've been encouraged to check out other Gary Duncan's Quicksilver releases. Couldn't hurt."
4,Interesting,Good story with interesting characters. May challenge your vocabulary but can hover your finger over the word and on my kindle a dictionary pops up and defines the word. First book I read on my new kindle. Quick and an enjoyable read which would have made an excellent old time radio program ... don't know if it ever was ... May hear it sometime on my xm-radio.
5,Adorable and fun,"The other reviews give you a fairly good taste of the plot, so I'll not bore you with that. I came to this book from the other side of things -- while I've never been a mystery reader, I'm a nursing mommy, so of course I was immediately attracted to Juliet, who nurses, mothers and sleuths with wit and style, despite the occasional sleep-deprived faux pas (like opening the door for the Fed Ex man wearing nothing from the waist up but a nursing bra with the flaps open).This is tasty, fun stuff, a fast-paced quick read with a surprise ending. Just the thing for a mommy who's trying to actually read a book despite the infant and the toddler snapping at her heels."
4,A DELIGHT!,"I must admit I never wanted to give up my career to stay at home with a baby or two! I would have gone nuts! The frustrations felt by Juliet were just too realistic. They must be borne out of real life for the former public defender. I had a newborn a few years back. He didn't sleep much either, as I recall. I hurried back to work to get some rest! Juliet is hilarious, spending a fortune on an outfit for the party given by her husband's perky partner, Mindy, so that she will look ""fabulous."" Of course, Juliet forgets to wear her nursing pads under the outfit, so has to hide out in the kitchen much of the time. I enjoyed learning about the Hasidic customs. The mystery surrounding the disappearance of Fraydle gave Juliet something on which to exercise her gray matter when she wasn't trying to capture a few minutes of shut-eye! A delightful read. And short enough to read in a day."
2,The hands move when touched,"I bought this watch for my grandfather who pretty much can't see. It sounded like a great idea: a watch that would allow you to feel the time. Problem is the hands move when they are touched, so it pretty much defeats the purpose of the watch.The quality was decent I suppose, and if you are not clumsy this watch could work for you."
3,Bardot Rules!,"""Viva Maria"" is a cute film with a lot of action, some campy songs and Brigitte Bardot! Jeanne Moreau is Bardot's co-star, but you'll have a hard time noticing her, since in most shots she's standing next to Bardot! Brigitte was never lovelier than she is in this film, and she demonstrates a nice touch for comedy! If you're a Louis Malle fan, you'll be surprised-- this film is unlike any of his other movies that I can think of! It's light and fluffy and very focused. I particularly liked the finale, in which various circus characters that we've come to know use their circus talents to rescue the Marias. Of course, much of this film's cleverness may seem dated now -- we've all seen variations of many of the film's best elements time and again since this was released in 1965! But there's no chance anyone will ever top Bardot -- she's perfection!"
2,"""Awaw-a-waw-awaaaaa""","If you think ""awaw-a-waw-awaaaaa"" looks silly, try listening to it sung! Good lord, the track ""Good"" is pretty terrible. Why? Anyone with ears could listen to this song once and tell you. It's the whiny singer going ""wwuuh-haarwww"" at the beginning of every line of the chorus. This is what passed for lead singing in the nineties. It's annoying hearing it once; listening to it many times would be akin to being locked in a garbage can with the stars of ""Revenge of the Nerds."" (No wonder the girlfriend that the singer is apparently singing to no longer lives with him; doesn't sound like it was that 'good!') Then at the end there is a lot of totally unecessary feedback noise while the whiner carries on going ""awaw-awaa-awaa""; think about it, does this really add anything to the song or did they just leave it in because the band didn't know how to end it?"
5,Another book from an excellent series.,The whole series is excellent. I highly recommend them to anyone who has a child who likes to read and likes biographies.
4,As A dedicated Anglophile,"As a dedicated Anglophile, I own the Portrait of England on DVD. The photography is superb and that alone makes it worth watching over and over. This is photography as an Art form and I often play it with the sound turned off, enjoying the silent countryside and the views of England as the music does get tedious afer dozens of replays.This video would have been enhanced by small subtitles (which could be turned off) telling the viewer what they are seeing. It does leave one sadly adrift and longing for information. It would also have been enhanced by having the natural sounds of the countryside instead of this too lively music that is unsuited to the pastoral views of Engalnd."
2,Beautiful but Uninformative,"The scenery is beautiful, especially the aerial flyovers. However, I found it very frustrating to have no idea what I was seeing. Even the most basic captioning would have vastly improved my viewing experience, without detracting from the ""artistic"" side of the presentation."
2,This is a music DVD and not a travel DVD,"This DVD plays a number of better known English classical pieces while showing scanning shots of large English country houses. There is no narration, subtitling or labelling of the locations. The video quality is not what we expect of a DVD. Anybody buying this for the graphical content or the travel element will be dissapointed. I recommend buying a CD of Purcell's music, if that is what you want. This thing is worth about the same value (Five to ten dollars)."
4,Relieve Your Stress!,The beautiful and tranquil locations in this DVD are so soothing it's almost hard to stay awake! I enjoyed the music featuring Wynton Marsalis and just put the volume low to maintain a serene experience. It would be nice to have some information on the locales. Great way to end your day!
3,So So,"car looks nice, although a light was wired wrong on my so the back breaks only one light comes on. its cool for the kdis to see the hard top retrack and go back. its a fun, nice looking and durable toy, only think i did not like is that it has a very limited range, only goes about 2 houses down my block and then its out of range."
4,She's Got Country Club Types Cold,"Heller's strength in this novel is satirizing the country club set. My parents have always belonged to a similar place and Heller has got that aspect of the story down cold. I laughed myself silly. She also puts in a love-romance part of the story and creates two possibilities, her protagonist's rediscovering her life with her country club-golf obsessed husband or taking up with the policeman who recruits her to investigate the club undercover because of the murder of a noted feminist who was a member. The romance aspects are ok but the reason for reading this novel is the LOL hilarity surrounding the cast of characters who belong to the club."
4,first class satire,"I just finished this book and loved it to the last page. Jane Heller is a first class satirist--the best satire is only a hair away from the real thing. I'm a New York editor (working, unlike Judy Mills) who's been downsized twice, I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut, and board the train every day probably minutes from where ""The Club"" is supposed to be. I'm a lousy tennis player and hate golf. So let me tell you, she has it right down to the details of every stereotype, from the men's and women's apparel, the attitude, the commuters, etc. Of course the characters, from WASPs to radical feminists are all exaggerated, but they're supposed to be. I was laughing through the whole thing, even though one of my favorite people got killed. But don't get me wrong--there are a lot of great people in this county, and I wouldn't be anywhere else in the continental U.S. I don't mind laughing at myself and my environment when it's well done."
3,Entertaining send up of the Country Club Set,The Club is perfect for a beach read. It is light and witty with a murder mystery thrown in. Heller's books are always fun.
4,Funny and heart-warming,"Jane Heller is always a funny, witty read, but this book is also a heart-warming look at modern married life and the joys and stress therein. In her usual biting satire, Ms. Heller exposes the foibles and humanity of ""the counrty club set"" as well as her heroine and heroine's family. Even in her quick, snappy writing, real people with real feelings shine through."
3,A little fun and a little murder,"This book is a fun read for the beach. It is light and whimsical. It is not the book to read, however, if you are looking for a substantative read, this one isn't it. If you just want to kill some time and have a few laughs along the way, this is the one"
4,Definitely for young readers,"I'm a great Lawhead fan. While I enjoyed this book and the entire series, I have preferred his other series far more. Great book/series, though! I will be donating it to my community's high school library. And I have already recommended the series to some teens & preteens I know who are always searching for a great read."
3,Warlords of Nin,"The Dragon King Trilogy is a great series and I really enjoy reading it. However, The Warlord of Nin is not nearly as interesting to me as the other two books. Still, it is worth reading even if just to get some history and set up for the next book. It reads really smoothly, it just doesn't have the same magic that Lawhead's other books do. Despite that, I will be reading this book several times as I go over The Dragon King Trilogy time and time again."
3,"Yeah, pretty much","This basically sums up the discipline of sociology in its broadest sense, I had to read it for class and if you're looking at this you probably do too."
1,Be Aware,"The photo shown in the description above is NOT the blade being sold. What you're buying is actually a fine tooth blade with about 12 teeth per inch. The model number is correct, but the photo is wrong."
3,Something was in his brain for this night,"The versions of voodoo child, purple haze, and fire are hendrix, but not amazing Hendrix. Little Wing and Good times are especially good, while Red House flat out stinks. The Jim Morrison tracks are not as great as i expected but are not bad at all. Morrisons lament is strange and disturbing and i wonder what and how much he had to drink. The sound quality is less then average but all in all it's an allright cd that catches to great artists together."
3,A compolation of great music but Horrible sound quality,Great performances from great musicians. Jimmy Hendrix plays with some of the best musicans in the buisness on this two disc set. I just got frustrated because of the extremly poor sound quality on the discs. but over all it captured some great music.
2,19 Not so great performances.,"Okay, what we have here is another rehash of the Royal Albert Hall'69 concert, Scene Club jam NYC'68, and Lonnie Yougblood material from '66 (which, BTW, doesn't contain a single note of Hendrix at all!). This is definitely for the Hendrix completist, and not the casual listener. Quality isn't bad, but it is a bit of a hack job. Still, don't expect this to spend much time in the changer!"
3,Hendrix-Morrison concert,"This is a classic concert with Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison. I first heard it at an old friends house and I had to laugh listening to Morrison(you'll have to listen to the CD). Hendrix was not playing in his best ability, but I personally enjoy sitting down and listing to ANY Hendrix concert. If you are a collecter it is definetly worth getting a copy of this CD and if you are a fan of Rock music from the 60's(like I am) you will enjoy this."
3,Not Bad For An Un-offical Release,"I bought this in the late '90's and enjoyed it for a couple of years. At some point, I sold it and some other CD's for cash. I regret doing so because there are some rare tracks on the disc, such as Outside Woman Blues and Uranus Rock, not to mention the sub-standard but historically relevant live cuts featuring an inebriated Jim Morrison singing. These tracks I believe were from a performance at a club in New York, where some big names had assembled to hear Hendrix jam with an impromptu band. Morrison was there, and somehow got on stage and made a complete fool of himself; it is disturbing and funny all at once. Hendrix was not in top form either. This is a novelty and a fun listen, but shouldn't be played with children around. The cover photo is also a mistake, a reversed photo. There are so many crude unofficial releases out there from rogue labels, and this is one of them, but it contains 19 tracks varying from bad to decent."
1,Warning - only one (1) spacer per 'kit',"Even though this item shares a Mr Gasket part number with the same item sold elsewhere on the internet for the same price, be aware that apparently Amazon has gotten their hands on a special production run. While everyone else sells a 'kit' that consists of two (2) spacers, when purchased from Amazon the kit only contains one (1) spacer. Although the description here isn't specific enough to actually state how many are in the package, the weights and dimensions match those of other sellers. The only way you find out you just got half what you thought you would was when you open the package.I initially bought these from Amazon because of the superior customer service, but in the end, the only customer service I got to utilize was their return policy.To recap - buy this anywhere else for the same price and get two per package (i.e. a 'kit'), buy from here and only ge one."
4,About a leader,This exiting book contains 65 characters in the Todays BIG World. There are lots of things to learn from these 65 characters selected specially. To read this guide book about the leaders of the BIG World will enlarge your view in all kind of your relation.
4,Good Clean Fluff,"The Harvey Girls is pure fluff, but's it's very well done fluff. It's really just a vehicle for a series of song and dance routines, tied together by a simple story of a girl who moves to the wild west and becomes a Harvey Girl. Harvey Girls were waitresses in restaurants along the old Santa Fe railroad lines.The plot has a little - and I emphasize little - bit of everything: Romance, comedy, drama, and action. My favorite scene was when Judy Garland retrieves the fresh meat that was stolen from the Harvey House.The music is great, and the cinematography is dazzling. This is a very colorful movie, and the DVD brings it out in all its glory. I did, however, notice some subtle color shifting in several scenes. That was mildly annoying. Overall, it was a lot of fun, and the 101 minute running time won't take up too much of your busy day. I recommend this movie."
4,present,I bought this as a birthday present for a friend who used to watchThis with her grandmother and is one of her favorite movies!!
5,"On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!",This has one of the best soundtrack since the Wizard of Oz. Judy Garland shines no matter what she stars in. This musical western is largely overlooked. The large production numbers are outstanding regardless of the lack luster supporting cast.
3,Better Than I Expected,"I cam across this movie by chance. I never had an interest in watching it as I am not a Garland fan. I was channel surfing and came accross the (It's A Great Big World) number. I was enchanted by Virgina O'Brien. This film is what made me a Virgina fan. Her musical numbers are superb. (Wild, Wild West) is definatly a stand out. Virgina was pregnant during the filming of this movie and alot of her scenes had to be cut.An unfortunate circumstance but I would of enjoyed this movie even with out Virgina. It is fairly entertaining."
4,good movie,"I wouldn't say that this was Judy Garland's best film, but it was always one of my favorites. It's about a girl that meets a man through one of those order-a-bride things. She's enchanted by the man's letters, so she packs up her stuff and moves out west to marry him. When she gets there though, she realizes that the man who really wrote the letters did it as a joke, so she becomes a Harvey Girl(a waitress at a high class inn) just to spite him. Of course the two fall in love. Don't they always."
3,Disappointing musical extravaganza,"I am a big fan of movie musicals and will even sit through some of the less well-made ones just to enjoy some good clean fun. But the musical numbers in this one were so below par (except for the oscar winner) that I couldn't help counting the minutes until they were over. Most of them seemed to go on forever! I also have a very high threshold for silliness (preferring that to the bathroom humor so prevelant in today's movies) but the bar room brawl between the ""good girls"" and the ""bad girls"" was a little over the top! I hated the ""Gigi"" ending when the ""good girl"" decides she can be a ""bad girl"" if that's what the man she loves wants. Ick!"
2,Kind of boring Judy Garland movie,"It was good to see the great Judy Garland in living color in ""The Harvey Girls"", but the movie itself is kinda over rated,and while there is maybe 2 good musical numbers in it,there really is no story line and the movie kinda drags and is boring in some spots. There is not enough story plot and too much boring musical numbers,I found myself falling asleep at times,but I am a Judy Garland fan! To see a great Judy Garland movie with a good story line and better musical numbers check out her movie ""Meet me in St.Louis"",you'll be glad you did!"
2,Judy`s worst,"Only ""Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe"" survives.... Judy overplays and the only thing worth mentioning besides the titlesegment is Virginia O`Brien... To me - this film doesn`t exist in my collection of Judy Garland items..."
2,The Harvey Girls review,I really enjoyed the movie. The story background is the Fred Harvey restaurants and concessions at train stations. My father worked for Fred Harvey at the Chicago and Cleveland facilities.Regarding the movie and Judy Garland - The movie is great and Judy was one of my favorite entertainers.Lane Hansen
4,finally something good,Good quality movie. Kinda funny grossing and some good surprises. Bit offensive that they think all college girls drink do drugs and are lesbians
2,Horror movies,"Well, the movie arrived in good fashion from Amazon. Unfortunately, the movie turned into a blood and gore fest. It seems, that the movie could have been better SERVED with the edible delights having a little more seasoning and preparation for some of the scenes. Other than that, it was more like Freddie K., with a horrible accent, puts on the feedbag. Argh! Pass the salt......B.L."
2,Warning...poorly cooked movies could lead to serious illness,"Okay!...What do you get when you mix Borat, Hannibal Lector, and the last two American Pie movies (Beta House and The Naked Mile)? The kind of movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. And just in time for Spring Break...of course. What was the purpose of this movie besides parading soroity girls around like a mild version of Girls Gone Wild? Maybe it was to show every stereotype of women in a soroity? Maybe it was to get a laugh or two out of a Hungary Chef (he's from hungary). I will give the movie two starts for one thing though. The ladies were hot! Like culinary school, it takes practice to make something people will enjoy again and again. Let's just hope they don't have the stomach to make up a second batch of The Cook...Okay!"
2,A bit silly,I bought this book to attend a class about the energies and color and found the whole idea too much of a stretch to be valuable to me. Obviously lots of people enjoyed it but I felt it was silly and unhelpful.
1,clunk,"Just what the world neeeds, more pop Buddhism. Clearly Ngapa Chogyam cant meet all the need for dharma pablum, so tarrah! Here is yet another new-age lamb in wolfs clothing to read while polishing your crystals. Why not read Pema Chogyam instead? And learn some basic meditation practices? Oh Trungpa the rubbish being marketed in your name!"
3,"A very thought-provoking video, despite its technical flaws.","This video presents startling facts about the Assassination of Martin Luther King. For anyone who still thinks James Earl Ray acted alone, they are in for a big surprise. The film asks all the pertinent questions about Ray's whereabouts, motivations, etc. The film however suffers from some technical problems audio-wise where the sound dips in some places. Despite its technical shortcomings (sound problems, weak narrative voice) this is a well researched documantary."
3,A helpful survey of pilgrimage in world religions,"The concept of 'Pilgrimage' is a universal one common to all the religions. As an outward expression of one's inner faith such sacred journeys are encourged in all the religions. This ritual also offers layers of meaning for an earnest pilgrim. The authors attempt successsfully to trace the origin and development of the theology and practice of such pilgrimages in the different world religions like Judaism, Islam, Christianity and Hinduism. A separate chapter is devoted most appropriately, to the Indian religions. A student would find the book very valuable and a pilgrim would be fascinated by the information. The book is illustrated with beautiful photographs from various parts of the world."
2,1986 Falls Short,"After a great run of collections from 1981 to 1985, Rock On falls short with their 1986 set. The compilation is dominated by second tier acts and outside of a couple of tracks like The Thompson Twins soaring ""King For A Day"" and Glass Tiger's infectious ""Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)"" (Bryan Adams supplies backing vocals on this fellow Canadian's song), the rest of the album is weak. Night Ranger's ""Goodbye"" is okay as is Survivor's ""Burning Heart"" which reteams them with Sylvester Stallone as the song is from the Rocky IV soundtrack. Songs like Robbie Nevil's ""C'est La Vie"", Nu Shooz's ""I Can't Wait"", Howard Jones' ""No One Is To Blame"" and The Jets' ""Crush On You"" range from bad to putrid."
5,She really writes well,"I read this book with great delight from the beginning to end. The story, the characters and the way of writing and delighting the reader are all first class.It is the first book I read by Susan Andersen but prompted me to order other books by her also. This book stands out from the flock. I'll soon begin to read it again. It is that kind of book."
3,Predictable but intersting storyline,"Former delinquent, turned master carpenter, JD inherits half a hotel from the foster mother who did not have faith in him. When he shows up to claim his inheritance (and start his life over), he expects to be met with resistance by her family. Instead, he finds that single mom Dru and her family are willing to welcome him with open arms. A bit of hero worship on the part of Dru's son, and some one on one time with Dru leads JD to believe that he may have finally found love And then a menace from his past shows up trying to threaten his new life.There is not a lot of mystery, but it is a good, formulaic romance with lots of chemistry."
4,Delicious,"You know how when you finish reading a romance and you don't want to start another book because you want to savor these characters and imagine what they will say and do once they're married and start having babies and you know the hero will continue to be a hunk and a sweetheart and you think about it for days afterwards? Well, this is one of those romances. Thoroughly enjoyable - a real keeper."
3,All Shook up entertaining.....,"This book was a fast read, containing good dialogue, humor (which I especially like)and the sex scenes were played just right. Having read all of Ms. Andersen's books I find I truly like her style of writing. The premise of the story is not completely original...bad boy meets good girl etc. But that's really why we buy romance books anyway. Ms. Andersen, I felt did a great job at portraying a responsible single mom. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes contemporary romance."
4,Just about perfect,What an enjoyable read! Ms. Anderson developed all her characters very well - very realistic dialogue and actions. Very lovable hero. This one's on my keeper shelf.
4,Very Good!,I'm a new reader of Susan Andersen and have really liked reading her books. I enjoyed the characters in this book as they had to deal with personal issues which hinder their romances. I look forward to reading more of her novels.
4,"good messages, not so great on visual","First, the lessons taught in this series is something that, lets face it, the entire world needs to hear. I love the message, however, the charachters are cute, but the voices could be better, more accurate, instead of sounding like one person just adjusting his voice for different charachters. I do wish the episodes were a bit longer, on this dvd, it's about 15 mins of obedience cartoon and another 15 of self control. It would've been nice for them to show multiple instances of disobedience/lack of self control instead of just 1 main one and a side one. But, those little issues aside, it's much better than letting your kids watch these awful cartoons that actually teach disobedience & lack of self control, among other bad tendencies. My 3 year old and 1 year old seem into watching these dvd's and that's what counts! The songs are catchy and keep their attention, just wish the actual charachters did their voices, instead of sounding like major voiceovers."
2,Poor sound,"I listened to this on my iPod (as a WAV file) with superb headphonesThe playing may be excellent, but the recording quality was noticeably poor. So bad I could not listen to it.Look elsewhere, perhaps even the Richter recording with Karajan."
5,Quick ship!,"Awesome transaction. The clear plastic cover falls off from time to time but all in all a great product! Best price, great packaging too."
1,Low quality [junk].,"It says made in the USA and that's a shame. You're more likely to be in the dark or electrocuted with this hunk of [junk]. The light seems convenient for about the first ten minutes of use. Later, the cases pop open and transformer falls out, the trigger arcs sparks; The sockets never make contact; the bulbs flicker. 1 star is generous."
4,a good book for math review,"I am taking a course in basic trade electricity, and bought this book to review basic math.The book delivers what it says it will. It is a good reference to have"
3,OK but flawed,"This book has some useful information in it but also has some flaws. Some of the pictures are mislabeled, for example a mid 80's early 90's mustang is labeled as a 1999 svo. It also has a few places were there is some minor conflicting information. It is overall an ok book for mustang information."
4,Well laid out and helpful little guide,"This slim volume lists all types of markets by the day of the week or month and location. There's also usually a contact number for more information. If you're going to be in Italy during the first weekend of the month, or the second Tuesday, say, you can check the listings for that time period. There are a few blank pages at the end of the book to write your own personal market notes!No doubt people will need local maps and/or guidebooks to help locate the markets; this book will work best in addition to other guidebooks - not as a replacement."
2,"Cute, tiny, poorly organized","I got this cute little book as a gift for my mother who loves antiques and is traveling to Italy this summer.Unfortunately, the information is organized by day of the week - and not by location. There is no index that cross-references by location (i.e. city, region). So you end up reading through every single entry for ""2nd Sunday of the Month"" just to find a market that's taking place that day in Firenze."
5,Highly Recommend!,"I really enjoy Christian fiction in a variety of genres, but very often I have to avoid the straight Christian romances. However, I did not find that to be the case with these 4 great little stories. While this book is definitely a light read, and sometimes borders on the cheesy, I found that the characters were more real and likable and that the stories dealt with areas of faith and love that pertained more closely to my life. If you are looking for a book that will make you think and challenge you without really stressing you out ( :) ), pick this one up."
3,The book doesn't cover everything in the PMBOK Guide,"The book is ok, though not great in terms of a study guide for the PMI Test, which is the primary reason for my purchase.It does provide a good overview & discussion on the topics it covers, but it doesn't cover everything outlined in the PMBOK Guide.Because it doesn't cover all topics, this book doesn't add significant value as a study guide for the PMI Exam. The book would be a good overview/discussion book on the topics covered as it gives various ""expert"" writings on the issues examined.As an official PMI Publication, I assumed it would cover all topics in the PMBOK. I guess this is what happens when we shop virtually vs brick/mortar."
3,huh?,"don't you doctors make enough money? $88 US for one book? That must be some kind of joke, or you are taking some serious meds.do us all a favour and look at the prices of similar books and don't be so greedy."
5,As Sweet as it gets!,"What has always impressed me the most about Ken is the way that he instinctively knows just what is needed to bring to a certain song in order to make it a standout hit. Not too many months ago, Ken would once again impress me with the tender and heartbreaking touch that he brought to the song, ""Paint Me A Birmingham"" (once again proving that he had not lost his touch with a great country tune.) Like many of Ken Mellons' fans, this new album is long overdue for us (and we are glad that it is here.) Sweet is Ken Mellons at his best; twelve tracks of number one hits that state why this writer has always been afan."
3,Good Attempt on Translating difficult Chinese,"I have just finished reading the Chinese Version of the story (which I would rate as 5 stars), and thought, although the English Version is pretty accurate, it somehow lacks the fluency the story should have. Because of the difficulty for foreign people to imagine the situation, readers are not involved in the story as much and is therefore less effective than some books like the Wild Swan. The translation has definitely lost some tastes from the Chinese version. However if you are a foreigner who wants to explore Chinese culture, or a person who does not understand written Chinese very well (like me), this is still the book to read,for this is a book that can endure repeated reading such that one can inevitably find more and more traces of Cao Xueqin's ingenuity."
5,Very good,"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."
5,Unlikely Heroes/ strong film and movie soundtrack,"""Unlikely Heroes "" is another example of quality film making from Moriah Pictures...And of course we can't forget the fabulous Music Score byLee Holdridge on Citadel Record labelcatalog # STC 77136, which is Superb...we purchased our dvd and cd soundtrack fromCitadel Records and it was a smart investment...Buy The DVD and Listen to the Beautiful Music SoundtrackYou will be glad you did.."
3,To commercial,"I like Karajan, I like the Berliner Philharmoniker. But here, I feel, they have overdone it... Too smooth, too soothing, too commercialized. It may not be the performances alone, but also the choice of pieces for this CD. The master had relaxed, and the results are merely mediocre. I prefer Karajan at his energizing best..."
4,Just a Little Bit of Butter,"The King's Breakfast is a delightful compilation of the rather obscure poems of A.A. Milne better known as the author of the Winnie the Pooh stories. I fondly remember the title poem from my childhood b/c of the illustrations and the king pleading for just a little butter for his bread from the queen, the maid, and the cow! It was difficult to find this poem again and I was thrilled to find this book to pass on to my new grandson."
4,Interesting and enjoyable,"I love this book. I'm reading it a second time with a hilighter. It is actually 2 books in one. Half describes their journeys across the country and the descriptions are very good. The other half explains what life as a full-time RV person is like, such as how do you decide on an RV, how do you get your mail, where do you find campgrounds, where do you shop, how do you find a doctor, how to save money when you are traveling, etc. It is a little outdated with a copyright of 2002 - the authors had no cell phones and campgrounds did not have cable TV or wi-fi. It had several helpful lists including their Top 25 Tourist Attractions. I wish it had a list of things to pack in your RV such as tools you might need to do a repair. I enjoyed this book despite it's age."
5,Steeles on Wheels ROCKS!,I truly LOVE this book! It is entertaining and very well written for the new rver! We learned alot from this book and have gone back to use it for reference. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out with an rv or interested in full timing. Two thumbs up!!
5,Frontline,"We have found this product to be the best one for our two dogs. We live in the woods, where we have wonderful vermin, ticks, etc. This product is quite helpful. We recommend it."
2,Still battling fleas,Not sure if fleas are building a tolerance to Frontline or what but we are still battling fleas after applying two tubes of Frontline within a 2 week period.
5,What a pleasure to have a six-pack,What a pleasure to be able to buy Frontline in a 6-pack and at a good price. when I had to buy it from the Vet it cost more for less. thanks for having this for Amazon customers.
2,Not Happy,"It helped, but did not work as I expected. Eventually you are forced to bath, retreat and start the whole house and yard cleaning process over again and again."
4,I would purchase again,"Tried this product prior to this purchase as we inherited a small chihuahua and wasn't sure how it would work. He seems to be fine with this particular product, but still has some scratching. I do recommend it for ease of use and effectiveness, even still."
1,Product ineffective,I carefully applied product per instructions to my two twelve pound dogs. The fleas were back in full force after ten days!
2,Not good results,I recently tried Frontline plus for the first time on my one year old lab pups. It didn't do a thing. I heard that dosing may need to be corrected...but I followed the directions and applied for their correct weight...I suppose I could up it..but I worry that this will make the dogs sick. NOT impressed.
2,Flea and tick control,"I received the package, but when I went to use the product one of the six applications had leaked all of the medication. I paid for six and in effect received 5 treatments."
3,opened box,"It appears that the contents are authentic, but I was concerned that the cardboard packaging had been opened. I plan to call the manufacturer to authenticate the vials of product by lot number and description. The vials appear to be intact. I have not used the product yet as I had left over product from another purchase. I wonder if the seller has bought the vials in bulk and then repackaged them for resale. That would be fine with me."
4,Frontline,I use it almost 1 year. Works good but after I use it my 15 months old dog has a little skin irritation for couple days.
4,careful,"this product is great but make sure you didn't want the plus, which also kills the flea eggs. this one does NOT kill flea eggs! i bought it by accident, the product is great for what it does but just be careful you aren't looking for frontline plus which also kills the eggs and larva."
3,Not the plus version and it came open,Not the plus version and the box came open. I guess it was my fault to not realize that it wasn't the FronLine Plus product. The box was open but each liquid thingy was closed. Fast delivery.
2,Didn't Work,"I put this on my dog, and I still saw a flea crawling on his belly. Now, I don't know if maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, but I instead went and got the tablets from the vet."
2,Doesn't work on certain skin types,"I used this on my puggle who has suffered from skin allergies. Because of all her itching, she's thickened the skin on her back. Our vet gave her an oral flea treatment two weeks after I treated my dog with Frontline because she was absolutely crawling with fleas. The vet said the Frontline wouldn't work efficiently because of the effects of her skin allergies. Just a warning - i know that Frontline works well on our cat, so your pet probably could benefit from this only if it has normal, healthy skin."
5,awesome service.,"quick and precise service. couldn't have asked for anything more. used to buy it from my dogs vet, but through this it comes out to half the price."
2,plus works better!!!,Top spot does not seem to work as good as the Frontline plus product. Had I known this I would not have purchased this.
2,ONLY 3 Month Supply NOT 6!,"The box on the product site shows 6 month supply, but the package received only contains 3 month supply. I knew the price was too good to be true, so be forwarned. It is available for less anywhere, including my Vet. No reason to buy from them. They need to update the image or clarify in the product description!"
1,Product shipped not product pictured on page,"I ordered two packs, 6 month supply each. I received two packs, 3 month supply each. I could have bought the same product elsewhere for a lot less money. I feel ripped off.Frontline Top Spot for dogs 23-44 lbs."
1,TOP SPOT does not work as well as FRONTLINE PLUS for ticks,"I decided to try out Frontline ""Top Spot"" this year rather than the previously used Frontline ""Plus"" because we do not have a problem with fleas. What I learned is that for ticks alone, the single ingredient (fipronil) ""TOP SPOT"" does not appear to work as well as the dual ingredient (fipronil plus (S)-Methoprene) Frontline PLUS. In other words the extra ingredient that is supposed to work for fleas actually seems to make Frontline Plus work better against ticks too!!!! I guess the other possibility is that I received a bad batch of Frontline Top Spot. Anyone else have a similar experience?"
3,Frontline and Fleas,"This product does not kill the fleas like it use to on my 9 year old lab. I have always gone on hikes in the woods in the Northeast and used this product almost year round, expect Dec. through March. This year my dog got fleas. I just switched products and do not know yet if the Advantage will work. I sure hope so. I have changed for the cat's as well. Not sure if the Frontline Plus would do the job. I have used this product forever."
1,Does not work,"I bought this product thinking it would get rid of fleas on my dog, instead it did the opposite. I used it and saw that it draws fleas to your pet and then sterilizes them, not kill them. So it uses your pet as bait to get the fleas and then the fleas die after a few days, but this does not stop the fleas from biting your pet. So this was not a great product and the reviews never mentioned this. So I was not happy with this product and will never purchase this again."
1,Frontline,"When I received the order of Merial Frontline I noticed the serial # on the box did not match the individual 3 packets inside. I called Merial and they advised not to use the product but to notify the business that I ordered from. I emailed the company several times and finally received a reply that if I sent it back they would refund my method of payment, I have yet to receive that credit. They explained it was probably an error by the manufacturer."
1,what exactly did I get?,"My dog has been on Frontline ever since I adopted her from a shelter. Never had a problem with it before. However shortly after I received and applied this batch she contracted fleas, which she promptly shared with my indoor cat.I know, I know (now) that the cat should get it anyway, but it was still an unpleasant suprise to discover a flea infestation on a dog that should have been protected. So that makes me wonder - what exactly did I receive from this company? How much of actual Frontline was really in the product that was mailed to me?"
2,Waiting Patiently,"After waiting for almost one month, I have finally received the product I ordered. It seems there was a problem with the shipping. When I did not get the product in a timely manner, I contacted the seller by e-mail. They responded quickly. We e-mailed several times and then they called me. The question was, do I want to cancel the order and get my money back or have them to re-send it. I took a chance and had them to resend it and it arrived within just a few days. I might note that my original order had two items in it. The first item arrived without an issue. JNS was pleasent to deal with and I would give them another chance when ordering."
1,disappointing,"After about 2 months of light use, the camera stopped working. Also, the output format was very difficult to work with. Absolutely will not work on a Mac. The price is coming down greatly...I saw it for $88 at Target."
1,It does not record video as MPEG-4 format,"The IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format, not MPEG-4. I bought one from 'egghead.com'. After 30 days, I contacted Aiptek to tell them the problem, they acknowledged that the IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format. They said there is nothing they will do about it. Do not buy this product. Aiptek advertises that the IS-DV records video in MPEG-4 format, but it doesn't. 'Egghead.com' won't deal with me because they say I should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date."
2,weird,"This product is nice but for some reason the lens kept moving on its' own. unless you check it out carefully, i would not invest in it."
1,This camera stinks...,"This little hand-held portable camera was good at first, I thought that the picture and video quality was fine, but then, 2 weeks after I bought it, the screen broke, and I can't even use it as a webcam. So now, I have to manually try to delete pictures and it is very difficult to maneuver. Also, with a very small memory chip, you can take maybe 12 pictures before the memory is full. I would recommend spending that extra $20-$30 for a better camera as this is possibly one of the worst digital camcorders that I have ever seen."
2,Unsure now,Only worked about 3 minutes first time we tried it but we are trying some other things???????
4,"A ""Must Have"" for Off the Air Digital Television","My digital TV tuners were having a tough time locking on to one of my local digital stations. I had good coax, antenna, and pre-amp feeding my set-up but with research and asking around I realized that my old splitters were probably a weak point. As an experiment I replaced one of them with this splitter. I do see an improvement. Not in the picture quality (with a digital signal it's either there or not there) but in my tuners ability to hold a signal and display the picture.So - If you rely on an antenna for TV, and you feed more than one tuner with your antenna, you may want to consider upgrading your old splitter(s) to a new one like this that's rated to at least 2 Ghz (2000 Mhz). This will more than allow for the higher frequency and increased bandwidth required by digital TV signals."
1,Problematic,"I received a different model splitter, but one that stated that it was a digital satellite splitter. However, it did not work. I set it up off the main feed, but nothing happen for the 2nd tv site. The feed continued to work for the tv in the living room. I have bought the Directtv box thru Amazon.com as well as a few other items trying to make the 2nd tv work, but no luck. I finally called DirectTV service to try and activate the 2nd box tv and told them I was trying to use the splitter, but they stated that it would not work. That I would have to have a separate line feed to the back of the TV. I know this is not absolute true. Oh, and DirectTV wants the box I bought from Amazon if I terminate with them. I told them they didn't pay me a dime to buy it and they would not get my box UNLESS they were buying it from me. I guess they thought I was suppose to just roll over and play dumb. Just a year left with them.Thanks Amazon,Sunnymaria"
2,ONLY 6 SIX INCHES,"When I ordered the gazing ball,I thought it was a 10 inch ball. the seller did not note the size. I was disappointed it was a 6 inch ball a better deal can be found........"
3,Fine T-shirt,"I ordered this T-shirt for my brother. He said he liked it. It looks fine and everything, it's just that the image is not as vivid as it appeared on the screen. Otherwise - it's pretty cool."
2,Placido,The disc was fine but I purchased it for a friend at his request and even though he likes it I still prefer Luciano Pavarotti.
2,Obviously A Used Item,"I received this item and was surprised to find that it was in USED condition. The breaker, while apparently the correct item, was scratched, had paint splatters on it, and had a chip of plastic missing on the hook that fits on the service box. I am hoping that it will still work, but I am a little concerned re how reliable it will be. I plan to install it and will report on it later."
5,Young Girls Should Get This Book,"I've reviewed hundreds, close to thousands of books, and I see the same thing in most books, be it large publishers or small publishers, best-selling authors, or new authors, I've always managed to find one or two typos. So, it is very very petty for a reviewer to trash a book based on finding a few typos in the book. As far as this book is concerned, I found very little. Now focusing on the more important issue - what does this book teaches - positive belief in yourself. This is combined with activities that help develop self-esteem and creativity. There are some detail instructions and recipes, besides suggestions on what to do. The fact that it ties back to the Gifted Girls Series is an added bonus. Young girls should get this book more for the message and for the activities. It is a fun book that is written, designed, and meant to be taken in fun. Highly recommended."
5,This is THE recording of Carmina Burana. A Must Get!,"Never before have I heard a Choral work of this magnitude and power. Orff's music is brought to life in this fantastic recording by the Chicago Symphony and Chorus. This is the only choral CD that I own that I can listen to for eternity and never get tired of it. The tone and clarity of the chorus is amazing, and the balance with the orchestra is perfect. Teachers - if you are looking for a tool for diction, tone, musicality, men's voices, and ensemble, you must get this CD. June Anderson will enthrall you with the last two soprano movements (In Trutina, Dulcissime). Bernd Weikl gives us bass/baritones something to idolize and strive to sound like. Many thanks go to James Levine for his extraordinary interpretations.If there is only one CD that you can get right now, make it this one. The power and precision of this version of Carmina Burana will floor you and anyone else who listens to it. It is one that should be in every musician's library."
2,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY,"Having performed Carmina Burana with a large chorus, I might have a little more experience with this piece than the average person who has only listened to recordings. I found this particular version of Carmina to be a little on the melodramatic side. Don't get me wrong-Carmina IS a dramatic piece, but too much of a good thing...just isn't good.Specifically, some of the slower solos were too drawn out. The tempo needed some help too. I felt like the entire recording was being dragged through molasses.Maybe I'm just used to a certain sound...I certainly agree that music appreciation is subject to each individual's interpretation. But if you buy this CD and feel the same way as I do, consider purchasing the Eugen Jochum directed version. It's sold on Amazon for a few dollars cheaper than this recording and it's sounds better!"
5,Carmina Burana,Thanks for the prompt shimpment. This is an awesome recording and is in excellent condition.
1,Best Carminas DON'T INCLUDE THIS ONE,"There are only two Carmina's which should ever be played ever. the 1997(?) recording with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Leonard Slatkin OR the 2002(?) recording of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus under the direction of Donald Runncils. EVERY recording I have ever heard of this work, the Chorus or the Orchestra or the Soloist or the recording its self is just PLAIN AWFUL!! These two recording are the only two which manage to acceptably balance all the correct elements for Carmina"
5,quality,"This recording of Carmina Burana is excellent quality. The product arrived right on time as expected. Thanks, item was exactly as portrayed."
2,Mac users beware,"My family has purchased four ViewSonic monitors, and have been impressed with the quality. However, I am disappointed with this purchase. I will probably return it. 1) The webcam works, but the microphone is not compatible with my Macintosh computer. I am very annoyed that this is not disclosed on the ViewSonic USA web site, but it _is_ disclosed on the ViewSonic UK/Europe site (found this out after I took delivery and was setting it up). 2) If I put my computer to sleep, the monitor does not sleep simultaneously. It sends signals back that wake the computer back up. This is a big pain, as I put my computer to sleep all the time. 3) I have tried calibrating the monitor four times now. The picture seems to have very strong Blues. All the whites are bluish. Like I said, I'm disappointed. Mac users especially, beware the VX2255wmb and it's incompatibilities."
3,Picture quite nice but what audio,Echo most of the comments on the board - video is quite nice the web cam is good though not great. The speakers are a joke - I got the integrated one to avoid having more items on my desktop - and while I am fine with the webcam I still have to get external speakers to watch a trailer online - worse enough try to play itunes. So if you are looking to replace items on your desktop forget it - the speakers are laughable. How they ever approved the design/specs is beyond comprehension - they are crap. As a screen with a passable webcam - pretty good.
3,"fabulous picture, garbage sound quality","Love the picture quality, but the speakers are so incredibly awful I am thinking of returning it! The sound quality is annoying, and forget listening to iTunes! So, now the dilemma, keep the monitor and buy external speakers or return it."
2,Poor audio -,The webcam is fair - speaker audio is fair to poor - and the microphone is very low output with poor sensitivity. An inexpensive microphone connected to the same port works great so it is definitely the microphone in the monitor.A discussion with Viewsonic tech support acknowledged that there are design or quality issues with the microphone.It is unfortunate to have to return the monitor since the display quality is good.
4,Shame about the sound,Big screen - good picture. Built in speakers do not produce enough volume - still need external speakers.
4,Great Monitor,"I've only had it for 3 days, but I find that this monitor is indeed great. I have not yet played with the settings, but it is very crisp and looks amazing. I have a few gripes though.1) Light ""leaks"" out of the top and bottom, but it's only noticeable when all the lights are off and I'm watching a movie. Even then, I don't really notice it.2) The light on the bottom of the screen that tells you it's on is really bright, and when all lights are off it kind of blinds you. I'm sure every monitor has that though.3) The microphone works, but it is a little quiet. Rest assured that it works fine though.Haven't tried the speakers yet, but I hear they are quiet. The webcam works great, I love it! Easy way to take a quick pic or movie.Good monitor, definitely worth the price. No regrets on this one!"
5,Great Book!!!,"For the individual that desires to really have God lead him/her, aware of the value of independently exploring God's word. If you are totally content with merely going along with what others tell you about the Bible, then this book has little value for you. But, if you are aware that even the best intentioned Bible ""studies"" will have subtle influences, leading you unaware down their own roads of thought, then this book is for you.In the index there is a really fantastic list of suggested reference materials. These are the tools one needs while pursuing a methodical, systematic study."
5,A Must Have In My Library,"I love this book! I purchased it about ten years ago and have been using it ever since. The book is great for personal use and group use. I have given it as a gift to others. Bottom line, if you want to become a more sincere and better developed student of the Bible, this book is for you. It is concise when compared to other Bible study handbooks and not full of fluff. It is not over technical and provides great methods to enrich your study experience. They give an example at the end of the chapter of each type of study. Do not hesitate to but this book!"
5,#9 of the Battle Angel Alita epic,"Ok here goes,#9,all I can say is that book is the best manga I've ever read!The art, amazing(this guy can draw),the story is a masterpiece,but I especially loved the ending!Alright, I'm going to stop sucking up, but anyway,in this book,Alita discovers about her past,what her name was,how she ended up in earth,where she came from,and what she was.The secret behind the utopia above the sky is revealed(there are 2,one about the people,and why it was built).Throughout the book Alita is after Nova,and seems to be her enemy at first..."
5,"Cyborgs, love, humanity, excellent art...a great combination","The only thing I hate about the english traslation of Gunm is the silly name they used, Alita, instead of Gally (the original heroine name), but what a heck...maybe somebody in the future don't gonna commit the same error.The Battle Angel series is one of a kind, a lot of people said ""is to violent"", ""to much blood,guts"",etc. etc. etc... but they forgot something...the story is ""human"" and about ""humanity""...I had tears in my eyes at the end of the history and in the epilog I cry...Hell, men don't cry...but human beings do...I recommend this saga of books for both women and men...is a great story with incredible characters and excellent art...even if you are not a SF fan you gonna like it, these books are more than just another ""cyberpunk"" tale.Kishiro, Shirow, Katsura, Takehiko Itoh...great artists and good stories (or just fun stories)...take note"
5,Exciting end to the Battle Angel series,"This Last Book in the ""Battle Angel Alita"" series answers all the questions in the previous books, and gives the exciting conclusion to the tangle life Of the Battle Angel"
4,Bio enzyme,These enzymes capsules help me digest my food. The bloating and reflux that I had been experiencing has subsided a lot. This is a re-order which speaks for itself.
5,Why the photo of a box.,"I had tried a different brand first and then found this one, which worked so much better for me. I was really confused at the photo cause it comes in a pill bottle"
3,Worth a shot but doesn't seem to do anything in my case. Willing to give it more time before calling it though.,"Since I started eating much healthier a few months ago and exercising regularly, wouldn't you know it, my stomach has been a wreck. Seems odd that this is the result of eating and living ""right"" but it's been since I started and hasn't let up.So I figured it could be due to the increase in protein in my diet and thought maybe this would help with breaking it down and not leaving me with an upset stomach so often.It's been a solid week of using it every day and I've not seen any change in any way whatsoever.But hey, it was worth a shot and figured I'd try it before my next doctors appoint to see if I could solve something that ails me without medication."
5,Works great,This enzyme product is just as good or even better then the more expensive brands I have tried. Really helps digestion since my gall bladder surgery:)
2,"Don't Know How, But They Did","Pretty girls in their underwear playing a game of football. Sounds pretty idiot-proof, but somehow the makers screwed this up. I understand this is a pure cheesecake factory, but bringing in former football players as their ""coaches"" and to hear them praise the girls' athleticism during their ""practice sessions"" was taking this just a little too seriously. Come on, get the girls in their underwear and play the game already!"
4,A GOOD COMFORTER SET,THIS IS A GOOD COMFORTER SET QUALITY GOOD MATERIAL GOOD RECOMMENDED.NOT TOP OF THE LINE OR WORTH THEIR STATED 300 DOLLAR LIST PRICE. $45.00 DOLLARS OR LESS FOR THIS ITEM IS MORE REALISTIC.
3,Great Deal but Deceiving,They sell this same set on WalMart.com for 69.00. So for 14.99 this is a great buy but is deceiving. This set does not sell anywhere for the retail price they have here. So you aren't really saving 300.00.You are getting a decent set but not the quality they want you to believe you are getting.
4,GREAT DEAL AND A GOOD PRODUCT,"I just got this set today and I'm very pleased with it. The quality is good and no one can even tell for how much I bought it. I desided to use it for my bedroom, even though it was bought for upstate. I RECOMMENDED IT. But i have to admit there are NO delightful awning stripe on the comforter and the bedskirt. The bedskirt is plain white. THAT'S NOT THAT GOOD. However, everything else is just like on the picture."
2,not as stated,worth the money I paid for this item in outlet..but not the same item...does not reverse to an awning underside or bedskirt.....not even a reverse underside ......a different set????definately not a 300.00 set.....
2,Book reports,"This is a collection of book reports about all the other sleep books. Most information is what you can gather if you read the covers of other books and flip through them. The price is very high. Review all the books under 'sleep' here at Amazon to gather information. If you believe in letting a baby cry to sleep check out Ferber, if you want to go the gentle route go to The No-Cry Sleep Solution."
1,No secrets here,Can I give 0 stars? This is a complete waste of money! The Sandman has nothing original to say. He simply poorly paraphrases the leading experts. I wouldn't give this book to anyone trying to find any answers to sleep problems.
4,It Works! Amazing Baby Sleep Secrets,My wife and I found this book very helpful. Having a information from all of the sleep experts helped us make our descion easily. Once we started using the techniques our child was sleeping well through the night.
4,A Course in Carnal Knowledge,My review is already written.I will send it in another post.I am also an erotic writer - my own recent publications could be mentioned if you ever list a reviewer's own fiction.
1,Hated it!!!!,Does this heroine have any self esteem at all? It seems not according to this book. Hated it! Degrading content.
5,I READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!,"It's such a jewel of a book. The first time I read it, it lifted my spirits and energized my body so that I felt that I could accomplish anything I wanted. All I needed to do was begin. And you know what? I've read the book again and again with the same results. I have finished so many projects and fulfilled so many dreams...all because of THE RESILIENT SPIRIT.Thank you, Eileen McDargh!"
3,Good book for business professional,"Doing a book report for school on this one. Decent information on presentations. If your in sales or have alot of meetings, its a great resource. Quick read."
1,Would have rated it a -1 if possible,"Be informed that you will be paying a monthly service for versacheck payroll. This program is basically a middle-man, a link to a payroll company you will be paying every month to use. I can do that locally. THEN, all this is done over the internet. Utter Garbage I tell you. Save your money and find the numerous software titles where you pay one time and offer the same as this but personal and confidential."
1,No Need For This,"There is no need to purchase this software it does not help you with payroll, the best thing is to use online payroll services such as intuit. This software was a complete waste of time and money I ended up having to use intuit anyways to do my payroll."
3,Satisfied,"My son loves Under Armour products. This shirt is what it is - a shirt. The fit is good, the design is ok. Over all, my son is satisfied."
3,A very good EP/Single,This Single/EP contains some very good yet very different versions of familiar Buckley tunes. Definately worth the purchase for the serious Jeff Buckley fan.
5,Incomparably good performance,"I have a reasonably large CD and LP collection and have listened to many recordings of many works by various artists. However, if I have to pick my favourite recording of all time it must be this Mutter-Von Karajan recording of Beethoven's violin concerto!"
2,Mutter's Beethoven is dull and lethargic,"This is the most boring Beethoven concerto I've ever heard. Mutter's rhythms are much too slow, and her musical maturity at the time of this recording does not do the Beethoven Concerto justice. This is a recording that lacks musical maturity and excitement. I would highly recommend Perlman's Beethoven Concerto with Guilini over this recording."
3,Bicentennial Hits,"This Rock On collection of hits from 1976 is an up and down affair. There are a couple of great songs, the smoky ""Sweet Thing"" by Rufus featuring Chaka Khan and the AM Gold of Orleans rumbling ""Still The One"". A few decent songs like Dorothy Moore's soulful ""Misty Blue"", The Sylvers kinetic ""Boogie Fever"" and Gary Wright's punchy ""Love Is Alive"". The balance of the album goes from passable songs like The Bellamy Brothers' ""Let Your Love Flow"" to down right junk like The Bay City Rollers' ""Saturday Night"", KC & The Sunshine Band's ""Shake, Shake, Shake (Your Booty)"" and Silver Connection's ""Get Up & Boogie""."
2,Ponderous,"Of the many recordings of this warhorse concerto I find this one to be one of the most difficult to listen to without producing some degree of discomfort. The artist approaches the music in a ponderous fashion, perhaps seeking deep psychologic perspective. If so, it leaves one wanting the tempo hastened at several points. He can produce a beautiful tone. The piano is too ""forward"" in the recording. There are many preferable CD versions on which to spend your money."
2,Not A Great Start To The 80's,"Rock On's 1980 collection is one of the weaker albums in the series. Blondie's ""Call Me"" was their biggest hit, but hardly their best song. Ambrosia's ""Biggest Part Of Me"" is a very good soft rocker. The Doobie Brothers' ""Real Love"" has an extremely catchy keyboard hook and a strong Michael McDonald vocal. The always appealing Little River Band provide the breezy ""Cool Change"". Much of the rest of the album is made up of clunkers like Robbie Dupree's ""Steal Away"" on which for some unknown reason he imitates Kenny Loggins, the banal ""Lost In Love"" from Air Supply, Rupert Holmes' ""Him"" is complete garbage and even the normally great Spinners slip on the poor cover of ""Working My Way Back To You""."
4,West Point Sings!,"For those for whom the title suggests a ""cadets learn to become good soldiers"" drama or who are only familiar with James Cagney in his gangster roles, this will be a surprise. This is a great 50's musical packed with the cream of the crop at Warner's at the time. Gordon Macrae (Oklahoma!, Carousel) Gene Nelson (Oklahoma!) Virginia Mayo (all those Danny Kaye movies), Cagney, and a perky early in her career Doris Day all provide a great time. Macrae and Day sing beautifully, Gene Nelson's dancing is on par with Gene Kelly, and Cagney is at his Yankee Doodle Dandy best. My favorite moment? Cagney and Mayo showing the cadets how to ""sell"" a number in ""By the Kissing Rock."" I highly recommend it."
5,Fits just fine into the siemens panels.,"Not much to say, it's a great circuit breaker, the same as you would find in the big box stores."
2,Dull,"Not my favorite cd, very sophmorish and all of the songs tend to run together and sound the same."
1,From heroes to zero.....,"After hearing their CD ""This Beautiful Mess""... I was really attracted to the group's style and sound... I was very excited to hear this album, but after hearing it... I was very shocked to see that the group is turning secular... I would check out ""This Beautiful Mess""... that is one amazing album... =)"
3,Pretty Good but gets boring,"The only songs I liked were KISS ME,THERE SHE GO'S and I CAN'T CATCH YOU all the others are foozie's but those three songs are really good and I think that they count as a whole cd"
2,utter silence may just be a better alternative,"B-O-R-I-N-G~! That extra star is for ""Kiss Me"", everything else can just be as well as lullaby. PLease sample it 1ST before decide to listen to all the above reviews written by zombies who are thrilled to just own a cd advertised by the big-daddy record labels."
4,The lyrics are great,"They write very catchy tunes. Sometimes the song is annoying but other than that it is great!!! The song fits, She`s all that "". I like it a lot. They did a good job on it."
4,"6 PENCE SYMPONIES ""KIZ ME!",Ah audia diese manys x qd. Ve 0-20 cd here. Diese bttr. Boyfrend luv deise! Ah lab ve sukkle ^ et plae deise. ah x 6 Pence ar like symponies. Par sophscate musek a'la Beatles!
3,"CD was ok, but their numero uno hit ROCKS!","The CD was ok, but their number one hit, ""Kiss Me"" from the movie ""She's All That"" kicks major boottie! And so does that movie!"
3,Ok BUT not the best!,The moment I heard Kiss Me I fell in love with it but the other songs just don't cut it. I wish Kiss Me came in single form cause then you wouldn't have to waste your money on the whole cd!!
5,This is the BEST! You really need to hear it!,Kiss Me is my favorite song now. After hearing it only once I instantly fell in love with these catchy lyrics and wonderful melody. Everybody should hear this song and this album. You haven't heard music until you've heard this.
5,I love Kiss Me,Ever since I heard Kiss Me on the She's All That comercials I've been in love with it. It is a really great song.
4,To my midnight love,"This song has a lot of meaning to me.It's soothing ,fun,and has a sense of romance to it. Dylan I hope when you hear this song (kiss me) you feel the way I do."
3,"Only good for ""Kiss Me""","I love ""Kiss Me"". I was hoping that the album would be a slight echo of that! Sadly however, there the sweet melodic tones of ""Kiss Me"" are missing in the rest of the tracks! STICK TO THE CD SINGLE .... it's worth the money!"
5,THE WARM SOUND OF SUMMER,"Picked this album up on impulse because I've always loved those radio-friendly songs There She Goes and Kiss Me, which featured in the film She's All That and TV's Dawson's Creek.There's something about this jangly American guitar band and their upbeat summer sound - plus singer Leigh Nash has that cutesy, girl-next-door voice that adds to the happy feel good factor that singles out Sixpence None The Richer.Guitarist Matt Slocum is such a fantastic songwriter - he composed most of the tracks himself. I especially like the song The Lines Of My Earth with its haunting melody and lovely line ""This is the last song that I write, 'til you tell me otherwise.""I don't know if the band are still going, as I haven't heard anything from them for ages, but I do hope so otherwise.Beautiful album that I just can't stop playing."
3,"Its Okay, but worth sampling before buying.","Well, this was one of those, ""If I didnt get it as a gift, I wouldnt listen to it"" C.D's. The music is great, and the songs are cool, but its just not my ""Cup Of Tea"". The lyrics can be confusing unless you repeatedly listen to them, and pay attention to every word! I'd sample this c.d. before buying!"
4,They looked like a one-hit wonder until...,"I searched all over the creation for this disc and finally found it in the Religious section of a local record store. I should have waited. Although I got a good deal, the version I purchased was without the later added ""bonus track"" ""There She Goes"". Listening to my version of the cd, Sixpence is a pretty good,lightly flavored band with just one song(""Kiss Me"") that stands out . I'd recommend this cd for people who generally like light fare (The Sundays, The Innocence Mission, etc.) It's just too bad we sometimes get penalized for getting music early. Next time I'll wait."
4,Music I understand,"I'm by no means religious, much of a music fan, or anything. I have a few CDs I really like ranging from Jewel to Rancid. I just got this CD, and it is wonderful. I'm really glad I added it to my collection."
5,Kiss Me,"""Kiss Me"" is the best song I've ever heard. The first time I heard it on the radio, I knew that I just had to have the CD. I think that the other songs are really cool too, especially ""There She Goes"". If you buy the album you'll like it a lot."
5,Never Fully Appreciated,"Like most of my generation, I spent most of the late 90s buying CDs for one or two songs. Spending up my parents money on music. I'd buy the CD, listen to the radio singles over and over again, get sick of the radio singles and drop the entire CD.This CD sat on my shelf for 7 years and out of desperation for some new music and (and not having enough money to buy a 20$ CD) I blew the dust off and popped it in my player. I just recently realized how truly wonderful and unique it is.It's not just hippy happy pop folk rock. It's so much more. It can take you to your highest high and deep down to dreary and dark places. I recommend it to everyone. It's truly a hidden treasure. It didn't get nearly enough attention and credit that it deserved.Buy this CD and then buy the rest of them. You won't be disappointed!"
5,I think this CD has a chance to go all the way to the top.,"I really enjoy this CD. I think that most people can relate to at least some of the songs on this album. Sometimes it takes me a little while to get used to certain songs. ""Kiss Me"" is a song that I fell in love with right away. To sum up that song in a few words would have to be ""a crush type song"". I find that most of Sixpence None the Richer songs have a funky and likeable sound to them. I would buy this CD"
3,"A mixed bunch, but it's growing on me...","I bought the CD after hearing ""Kiss Me"" on the radio. But be warned - the other songs are quite different and more downbeat. I stopped listening to the cd halfway through on the first go, but have perservered with it - and it's definitely growing on me. Just don't expect an album of bouncy ""Kiss Me"" tracks..."
4,"""Kiss Me"" isn't the best song on this album...","In fact, ""Kiss Me"", while it's a great single, isn't a good representation of this album at all--the songs go much deeper and rock harder ... or at least smoother! Singer Leigh Nash's earthy and unbelievably honest-sounding vocals take center stage and yet don't overshadow the excellent playing by the band.However, the real stars here are the songs themselves. While it's sad that an album full of completely enthralling and original-sounding tunes by a band has become a pretty rare thing in this age of plastic copy-cat crap, it sure as heck makes you appreciate an album like SIXPENCE NONE THE RICHER when it comes around.Top picks: ""Love"", ""We Have Forgotten"", ""Sister, Mother""."
5,Stronger elements than most bands,"I have heard about Sixpence for years from my college buddies, but never really cared to check them out (they were a little too mellow for my tastes at the time). But, MAN, what I was missing! Much like LUXURY (check them out in AMAZON, also!), Sixpence is highly under-rated and misunderstood! Not Christian enough for some of you? Have you tried reading the lyrics?!? And if so, try THINKING ABOUT THEM! Great rock...FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!"
2,This is way OVER-RATED ! ! !,"Mostly dull repetition. What's ""there she goes"", give me a break. Whatever."
1,What was I thinking?,"Sixpence None the Richer was a cd I had back in the day and I am glad I threw it in the trash. Kiss Me and Love are the only decent tracks, the rest of the album is dreadful and forgettable. Don't waste your money on this lame fluff, you'll thank me later."
1,It blows chunks!,"Some christian band?! Hah!I've heard better singing out of my neighbors garage band, and they're an instrumental group! Please! Look at the video! It looks like somebody had a little too much holy water!!!"
1,"OH MY GOD, THIS CD IS TERRIBLE!","This has got to be the stupidest bunch of people I have ever seen! My uncle, who knows nothing about popular misic, could do better! Dead people can make better songs! Besides, when you're searching for MP3's they always show up when you're looking for the real KISS! THis CD is a waste of time and money!"
1,It was bland. The same jargon as all other female 'jewel' CD,"This CD was boring. The same happy-go-lucky female crack smoker music that has been heard on all of the top female albums lately. Such as Jewel(what's up with her teeth), Lisa Merchant, and liz phair. not to mention the entire Lilith Fair.This doesn't mean I don't like some female artists. Lisa Loeb, Sarah McLaughlin, and Tori Amos are awsome. But this album bit the big one."
2,REPETIVE SHLOCK FROM A ONE HIT WONDER GROUP.,"There was ""Kiss Me"", a #2 smash in the US....Then the next single ""There She Goes"" which barely and I mean barely touched into the top 40 which is NOT EVEN ON THIS ALBUM!The lead singers voice just gets so grating - with no vocal range or change in her songs. Its like one big sleepfest on this CD.I am sorry but I really feel Sixpence won't get richer with this CD, and furthermore I will bet big money they will never have a hit again.I give them 2 stars because ""Kiss Me"" was original and refreshing....""There She Goes"" was just a remake that was only remade because it fit the singers vocal range.There she goes.........losing her recording contract."
4,Catchy light pop,"When I first heard <em>Kiss Me</em>, the tune was unforgettably etched into my mind. It had a cheery, light tune that was simply enchanting.So I put the self-titled album from Sixpence None The Richer into my Amazon Wishlist, where it languished for several years. I finally bought it and had it delivered during my last trip to the US, and I wasn't disappointed.The album remained true to the light catchy pop genre - nothing overtly religious even though the band started out with Christian music. I'm fond of Christian pop-bands, mostly because these song-writers seem closer to their music than the regular pop-commercial offerings. Matt Slocum does a great job of blending Leigh Nash's lilting vocals with intriguing lyrics and wrapping these in a compelling melody. That made for great listening.Unfortunately, I've just found out that they have been disbanded. Too bad - they had a promising sound.This genre might appeal to those who like Jars of Clay."
4,Incredible.,This CD just flows. I pop in this cd and just let it play through... not like most albums that have me skipping from track to track. Definitely one of my recent favorites... trust me on this one
4,Sixpence worth a listen!,"The band Sixpence None the Richer is one of those 5 year overnight successes. The masses are finally finding out what some of us have known for a few years now,this band is great! Matt Slocum is a talented songwriter/guitar player. Leigh Nash has the voice of an angel and their songs actually say something. Which in these days is not all bad. Although the beautiful little ditty ""Kiss Me"" has won them global acclaim, the best song on the album is ""Love"". It has a wicked bass line and Nash really wails. I hope this is just the beginning of many years of general market success for Sixpence. If not they'll have plenty of treasures stored-up elswhere."
5,The Sixpence CD is definitley worth buying.,"I really liked the single ""Kiss Me,"" so instead of buying the single I decided to spring for the whole CD, and I'm very glad I did. All of their songs have a certain sing-songy quality and Leigh Nash's voice really carries them well. I think that if you like ""Kiss Me"" or any other songs you have heard from Sixpence None the Richer, you will surely enjoy the CD very much"
2,Buy the Kiss me Cd-single instead,I saw all the reviews on this page and thought this will be a great cd. WRONG!! If you like Kiss me as much as I do you will be way disappointed in this cd. Kiss me is the only happy melodic song on the cd. The rest are to depressing...Save yourself 9 bucks and buy the cd-single. I wish I did!
5,"Deep, intimate, captivating!","At first, I didn't really get into the CD. I listened to it over and over, and it began to sink in and consume me. Each track connects to the next in a way that makes it one encompassing ride of human expression and emotion. Everyone has heard ""Kiss Me"" but there are some many more great (and even better) songs on the CD. Sixpence None the Richer is a band (and CD) you should not miss!"
3,I think it's an ok CD but...,"My copy which I bought thru BMG doesn't have the remake of ""There She Goes"" which is a bummer. Anyhow, I thought the Boo Radleys were the original but I guess it was the LA's because both versions are in the soundtrack album for ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"". Besides ""Kiss Me"", my personal favorite is ""I Can't Catch You""."
4,Solid disc,"(...) This is a great disc, I haven't listened to it in almost a year now, but today I decided to listen to it on my way to class. Fantastic, gets better with every listen. (...)peace."
2,i don't like there music at all,"well I think if sixpence is suppose to be a christian group then they need to show that they are christians. It is not my place to judge but if, I was a christian group I would act like a christian and try to have my focus on God and that is the only reason we are here anyways."
1,another Wack group,there she goes is catchy but it's a cover.now how many people do covers today? overall this group reminds me to much of NO Doubt.the same dry singing and bland music.
1,Try some real music first.,"""There She Goes"" is the best track on the album for a good reason: it's a cover version. Buy the original on the La's self-titled record instead and hear the uplifting pop music this band tried to write (without the wibbly Christian bits)."
1,Dont Buy This,"This Cd is the worst thing i've ever heard.All the songs are boring.If you are going to get anything,get the new BigPun,Jay-Z,Dr.Dre,or Sisqo CD.Sixpence None The Richer Is Horrible!"
1,This is annoying......so very annoying........No wonder the second half of the the 90's sucked musically,"This is disgusting. They are about as annoying as The Cranberries, and the only thing they have going for them is their faith. Other than that I probably wouldn't bother writing anything positive. The second half of the 90's sucked musically, and this is one of the reasons why. ""Kiss Me"" is a drab love song that annoys not appeals. ""There She Goes"" is a cover of a faceless band that did this on the remake of ""The Parent Trap"", or is it the other way around....either way it stinks. I usually don't write anything bad about Christian music, but this is one exception as this is just blah."
1,I'LL TELL YOU WHY THIS IS LESS THAN ONE STAR!,"TERRIBLE......and I'm not saying that because I don't know my music. I am a musician and a songwriter -- I know what I'm talking about! For secular music, sure, it's probably ""clean"". But this ""crap"" is actually labeled a CCM group? You tell me what's ""Christian"" about lyrics dripping with discouraging disillusionment, and singers basing everything on feelings!! I got depressed just flipping through the disc (and no, I didn't buy it)! Groups like this not only make the few good CCM hits appear the same by lumping them all together; they also give Christians a bad rap! This is not what it's all about, people! I'm not dissing their stuff because it's trashy or needs a warning label -- the words are barely understandable at best! I'm bashing it because it shouldn't be called ""Christian"" when it's not. Even if you call a spade a spade, this group possesses virtually ZIPPO talent to begin with -- Leigh Nash has no place in a recording studio!"
2,this is pretty good,i think this song is pretty good.it's not one of my favorites but it's a nice lovie type song.
3,This is an Ok cd,"A lot of people have bought this CD because of the song ""Kiss Me"" The song has been everywhere. And you gotta admit the song is pretty good. Well, I bought this CD becasue I had their first CD and wanted to get their next CD. This is a Christian band and I only listen to Christian music. I think ""Kiss Me"" is an OK song but not the best. The lyrics are awesome too."
3,Melencholy Mood music but very good melencholy mood music,I like this CD because I can do a lot of other things while listening to it. It has the warmth and feel that can trancend whatever I'm thinking about. It Doesn't reach out and speak to you it wispers softly in your ears.
3,i give it 3 and a half stars actually...,"Really pretty album. the instruments blend well together yet each of them stand out quite distinctly. leigh's voice is rather tiring to listen to sometimes, but it's tolerable. this is not the sort of music that i usually listen to, but what attracted me to it was their beautiful sound and overall, this is a relaxing and enjoyable album. the only problem i really have with it is that the song structures are a bit too simple (verse-chorus-verse) and in that sense it gets rather predictable but i still like it anyway."
4,Hippie Music,"I was genuinly suprised by this cd. My wife bought it. I'm glad she did. I thought it would be typical christian pop or worse, contemporary christian music that seems to pour over the airwaves from chritian radio stations in rivers of mediocrity and bordom. I like a variaty of music, metal, punk, folk, and yes even some contemporary. This is the first Sixpence cd I have heard. I love it! It has a folk/hippie flare about it. It's a nice break from the basic contemporary christian sound. Which I find dull and unoriginal. Sixpence has groovy sound. That's the best way I know how to describe them. I found the lyrics to be poetic and thought provoking. If you don't like the mainstream christian contemporary music or if you just want something a little different I suggest that you buy this album."
5,Gentle Nudge,"Strange, isn't it, that Sixpence became popular with one of the only love songs they've ever done? This group is anything but bubble-gum and saccharine dreams. Some other reviewers have questioned their true Christian content. True, their lyrics don't bang the listener over the head with dogmatic truths. Instead, in a world grown apathetic to spiritual truth, Sixpence respects us enough to simultaneously prick our hearts and minds, to nudge us forward on our search for truth. They allow us to discover our own relationships with the one living God, rather than demanding that we sign on their dotted line, thereby negating the aspects of the heart. I don't mean to be verbose, but Sixpence listeners take note that the music and lyrics are subtle, sophisticated, and rich in meaning. The more you listen, the more you like--the more you search, the more you find. They serve a loving God who, like Sixpence, offers love and grace without shoving them down our throats."
5,"Music for the heart,... music for the soul","their music is for the soul, the lyrics shoots through the heart,... i bought the album expecting to hear ""kiss me"" kind of music, or ""moonpools and catterpillars"" kind of jam,...but no,... i think i got better,... ""kiss me"" speaks of innocently romantic love,... the rest of the album goes deeper...'tis the kind of music i draw inspiration from for my art... the kind of music that is not for the ears alone but also for the soul to hear."
4,Kiss Me,"I had really gotten sick of the song 'Kiss Me' (they play it on VH1 every 5 seconds) But when my friend gave me this CD, I rediscovered it for the beautiful song that it is. I highly recommend this CD, as the other tracks were just as lovely (or in some cases, more so) than the much-hyped 'Kiss Me'"
4,Bolts on and quality product but does not fit quite right.,"I bought this for my 1990 camaro rs with a 305 tbi. There was only one review so i was a bit nervous when purchasing, that it would not fit at all. The product does physically fit and bolt on to the intake manifold. The flange is about 1/8 of an inch smaller compared to the stock thermostat housing. This leaves a portion of the intake showing which isn't a huge deal, but you should be aware of it. Another issue i had was with the supplied o ring gasket. the gasket is an o ring that fits into a groove in the housing. i had issues getting the o ring to stay in place while bolting it down. I ended using a bit of all purpose grease to get it to stay long enough to bolt it. Over all it is a good quality chrome part. I would recommend it if you are just looking for some shiny parts under your daily driver to wow your friends when you pop the hood. if you have a show car you may want to try a different product."
1,"big lie :""(",I bout this one in Amazon depending on the part finderAnd it said that this part fits your Chevy caprice 1994So I bout it and when it arrived it is completely deferent it dose not fitIt was for an older model for gm !!!!The question is how is wrong about this
4,"energetic, youthful performances","These performances present a crisp, well articulated Beethoven. Fortunately for us, these two artists can electrify the music while never descending into bad taste."
1,Television show on DVD Don't Bother,This DVD is touted as unrated but is just a rehash of the on air presentation. Curses are bleeped and naughty bits are pixelated. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.
1,If you saw it on tv don't bother,It is not unrated. Everything is still bleeped and fuzzed out. Bait and switch bull$#!t.
1,Don't waste your time on this.,"I'll tell you what this is: A total waste of time. I loved the show but all this is... is video snipets of the contestants getting asked one or two questions. There are absolutely no suprises here and you learn nothing new of the skanks in the cast. When Tom Leykis says ""pump 'em and dump 'em,"" these are the type of women he's refering to!"
3,Rock of Bret!!!,"I love Poison and CC is my all time fave. But in Ireland, we only got to see about 4 episodes of this show, and the one full one I got to see was the one where the delightful Bret got his tattoo fixed. Have to admit, my two teenage sons were trying to prevent me from being corrupted by the lovely Bret and wouldn't let me see anymore episodes...LOL. Can't wait to watch this. Oh and to VH1, lads, we love reality shows in Ireland, like Rock of love and the surreal life....please please show them over this side of the Atlantic."
3,Its okay,Its okay I just onoy purchased it to see the girls not just guy himself thats using his mansion as a play house....
5,luv it,"If you are a Bret Michael""s fan or a reality show fan then this DVD is for you.because i know i did."
3,Where's the other Seasons?!,Why haven't they Come out with Season 2 or 3 on DVD yet!? just get it over with and release them! also Season 1 is not Censored on Netflix at all.
2,Dont waste your $$$. Just Netflix it...,"Hi. I am a serious ROL addict and I was completely disappointed by my purchase of this set. Its exactly the same as on the show, albeit a little longer episodes. They bleep cursing, they block all the nudity, just as if you were sitting home watching Vh-1. The 3rd disc is the only one with a few extras in it, however the nudity is still blocked there as well. I was completely unhappy because I know they must have hours upon hours of extra footage, and I wanted to see things you DIDNT see on the show. Candid segements of the girls hanging out, being naked, partying, being crazy. None of that is on here. There isnt even a decent dvd menu with chapter options. Youre only choice is to watch the episodes in their entirety. Perhaps they can revamp the whole thing for season 2."
3,Rock Of Love CD,Fantastic Music. Great service to Australia from Amazon.com so get on board. Enjoy and love the music no matter what genre.
5,"Poignant, vivid music","This is a wonderful recording. It does full justice to the music, which is moving at the same time as being crisp and precise. Both concertos are excellent, and the whole is a haunting experience."
3,IM GOING TO HAVE TO REMODEL!!,THIS TOY IS FUN BUT YOU NEED ALOT OF ROOM TO USE IT.I RIPPED FROM THE TOP FLOOR OF MY HOUSE THEN I LATER FOUND IT IN A CLOSET DOWN STAIRS. IT ACTUALLY WAS SO POWERFULL IT BROKE THROUGH THE DOOR!
1,terrible and dangerous,"I have to say I am suprised people like this toy. I think its dangerous. Its very powerful and really ""flys"" off. My son got it from the easter bunny and we dented the car on the first fly off. I moved the cars out of the way but never did I realize that thing was going to go as far and as fast as it did. I would recommend buying this if you value your possessions. Theres no way an even responsible 10 year old isnt going to damage something!"
3,Procrustian bed,"This is a pianist who has a style of playing and makes the music fit it. The lower end of the dynamic range is ignored, and the touch throughout is crystalline, bright and percussive, never really legato and caressing. A formidable technique does not compensate for not searching for subtlety, nuance and implication.The only mystery in his playing is why he chose to record Debussy."
4,Exactly as advertised,"This book has about 30 Irish tunes for the recorder, suitable for a first or second year student. The lyrics are included (most have multiple verses) as well as guitar chords. There are also occasional historical notes as well as help with pronunciation for unfamiliar words in the lyrics."
3,Planes of the past - -,"An account of about twenty airplanes the author, Gann, has flown himself. Interesting pre-jet characteristics of the most important aircraft since the Wrights. It is not a story book with charaqcters and a plot - just very interesting tales and specifics on the planes."
3,Come back to the beginning.....,"I remember going to the Earl to hear Steve when I was barely tall enough to sit at the table (they had an early, family show and served us soda pops). This album captures that time perfectly, and his rendition of ""City of New Orleans"" surpasses even Woody Guthrie's. Come back to a smoky bar up a narrow alley in Chicago and hear a wonderful mosaic, some fixed to the locale but others that could sound anywhere."
4,Splendid Requiem recording,"This performance of Mozart's legendary Requiem holds a special place among countless other Requiem recordings.Karl Bohm's directing makes this piece very vibrant and alive - emotional and elaborate, as reflected in the rather slow tempos chosen throughout the movements. The solo performers and orchestra are all very involved and create a marvelous tapestry of music. When it's all put together, the Requiem radiates in the religious aura it deserves.The recording (audio-wise) is very warm and detailed - the organ portions are particularly alive, which is something lacking in many recordings.All in all, it's definitely a good buy for anyone interested in owning an excellent interpretation of Mozart's Requiem."
5,This is how God wanted it to be played.,"Usually we, classical music lovers, love to compare different performances, soloists and conductors performing the same piece. Karl Bohm's performance of the Mozart Requiem from 1971 is the first album I heard that made any comparison with any other performance of the Requiem totally unnecessary. This is how God wanted it to be played."
5,great!,"im no classical fan, but this cd is awsome! i hope they print it on dvd-a soon! (the cd quality is quite good, but this thing deserves a good 5.1 remake, cd isnt enough any more.)anyway, i play this LOUD whenever i can, its imerssive! for all you classical haters out there, this one will strike you!btw, dont bother with tracks 8-end, see ""Amadeus"" (on dvd) to learn why!...:-)"
1,Too slow,"This version is WAY too slow, and there are several places where the choir just doesn't have it together."
4,Slow at first but worth the read!,"I struggled through the first few chapters, but when it picked up it was fantastic! The story of young girls in New York City for different but same reasons and their eventual downfall was interesting and well written. I really cared about the characters and felt like I knew them. Awesome read!"
4,Retro Chick Lit,"Recalling an old story of the unknown author's hubby buying up gobs of her books to make her debut a bestseller, my curiosity wanted to know just how ameture it was. I was very intrigued to find Ms. Susann is a competent author and she wrote compelling characters in larger-than-life roles but in a believable style. Better than the movie."
2,Simply hideous! Colossal waste of time!,"To encounter this book in 2007 is to be reminded why women needed a feminist movement to self-actualize and appreciate that they did not need a man to fulfill their destinies or validate their worth. The book is...tres yucky on other levels, as well. The writing has an adolescent twang that is grating and inescapable; the author's inability to render the characters with any depth results in cardboard facsimiles of characters that are not believable and impossible to care about; the circumstances the characters find themselves in are so utterly cliche as to be ridiculous. Enough already with the pills! This is even worse than ""The Nanny Diaries"" or ""The Devil Wears Prada"" - my first and last forays into contemporary chick lit. What a bore! Campy? Creepy! Not even ironic. Moronic, perhaps. Back to the Goodwill bookshelf from whence you came, dolls."
5,amazing,i am a jackie collins fan and usually read only her books until someone one day suggested this book. It was amazing and i couldnt put it down. I would suggest this book to anyone especially jackie collins fans
4,"Dolls, Dolls, Dolls","Valley Of The Dolls obviously this was one of Susanne early books. It is absolutely amazing that nearly 30 years after it was first published that it is still a popular subject to read. Therefore, it is very fearful that our nation has grown in its abuse of the use of illegal drugs. If we do not curve this illegal drug use or prescription nerve stimuli medication, it will be the undermining of our nation. Naturally I did not like the theme of this book, but, this book did bring to light the story that some of us Americans live out each day. I would recommend the read of this book for an educational enlightment but not for information on how to abuse drugs. Somehow I believe that young readers might choose this book for the latter."
5,ADDICTIVE,"One of the greatest novels ever written. I found myself identifying with the character of Anne, routing for her throughout her battles. Was devasted by Jennifer North's tormented life. And was appalled by Neely O'Hara's self-serving nature. Once I started reading I could not put this book down. As an actress who has had the experience both in New York City and Los Angeles, I found the portrayal of these women's experiences and the backstabbing nature of showbiz bitterly truthful right to the end. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!"
4,Great for any generation,"I read this book in the mid-80's and again last month. I wanted to refreash my memory before starting the sequel Shadow of the Dolls. This book does not age and it is dificult to believe it was written so long ago! It is a story before its time, as you follow the lives of three young women and the men that fade in and out (and in) of their lives. They face hardships and challenges but always have each other. As with many female relationships, the women have their ups and downs with each other, but still manage to reach their goals and aspirations. The thing is, after they have realized their goals, they discover there is really not that many places to go after that but down. See who goes down, who stays on top and who rises back by picking up the sequal as well. A great beach book and vacation read. Enjoy!"
5,a captivating read,"Even though this book takes place long before I entered the new york dating scene, I found myself easily relating to Anne on so many levels! Susann's timeless motives and themes made this book such a quick read! I managed to stay up all hours of the night just to see what was in store for the girls!"
4,valley of the dolls an unforgettable first book,Valley of the Dolls was the first book I read for pleasure. I stole it from my mother and read it in about three days in our back porch mostly laying on a hammock. What I remember most is the femminity of the characters. The combination of strength and vulnerability. And who can forget the outrageous lifestyle. Valley of the Dolls was a great first read. It wet and spoiled my appetite for that perfect trash novel. But unlike a regular trash novel Valley of the Dolls captures the era in which is was set unlike any other book of its time.
5,brilliant,"Brilliant .. it was sensational and gripping from beginning to end. The rise and decline of these three women was riveting. the theme of the constant struggle women feel to be sucessul , but still chained to traditional expectations was well expressed"
2,No redeemable characters whatsoever,"My book club chose this book for our monthly selection.(Warning, mild spoilers below)While it was an easy and fast read (the only reason for the 2 stars), I really didn't enjoy the book. All of the characters are unlikeable. The men are either unapologetic cheaters or weepy cuckolds. The women are simply pathetic. They want fame, fortune, a man to worship them. And mostly, they all get what they want and then throw it away to drugs. None of characters grow or learn anything throughout the novel. I continued to read to the bitter end, hoping for some redemption somewhere, but alas, there was none."
1,Someone's got to give this a 1 star review,"If you're looking at these reviews you will see a disproportionate number of 5 star reviews, because most reviewers who read widely will not even want to be associated with this book. Be warned, it is garbage. I read this book when I was 14 and it certainly appealed to my prurient interests at that time. However, the book is not simply trashy, it's not believable. Don't waste your time, unless you have time to waste."
2,"Not ""Like New""","I was a little disappointed in this. It was supposed to be ""like new"" but it arrived in a terrible state. I can't even read it for fear of it falling apart, and I plan to send it back instead."
2,"boring, outdated pulp fiction","This book was a ""classic"" chosen by the current host of my book club. It just reinforces my belief that the host should always read the chosen book before making it required reading for others. It was painful reading for someone who is accustomed to reading modern as well as classic literature. It's an insult for it to occupy the same shelf space. My copy went into the trash."
3,fast read,Fun book in the beginning. Hard to really get attached to any of the characters. But interesting to read the perspective of women just a few decades ago.
4,A masterpiece of sorts,"Well, it's great to see so many people are reading and enjoying the work of Jacki Susann long after her untimely demise (so take that, Truman Capote). What can I say that hasn't been said already? Yes, ""Dolls"" is sudsy and over-the-top. Some of the characters are cartoonish, and a lot of them have really ridiculous names (Ted Casablanca? Tony Polar?) But, you know, after you strip away all the camp, melodrama and silliness, 'Valley of the Dolls' is quite simply one of the bleakest books I've ever run across. In the end, all you have is a person who can't live with the things she's wanted so badly all her life: all she wants to do is sleep. It's a devastating indictment of Western materialism, and I find it personally a hell of a lot more moving than the stuff written by literary-establishment types like Ursula Hegi or Toni Morrison. Long live Jacqueline Susann!"
5,Still the Queen of the Genre!,"Reading this 60's classic with a modern sensibility is great fun!! Try reading some of the passages aloud in bed to a loved one... could be a whole new approach to your bedtime routine! Sure, the movie is trashy fun, but the book--believe it or not--surpasses even that! If you DO end up reading this in bed, you might need ""dolls"" to fall asleep 'cause you won't want to close your eyes!"
3,a quick read,"I agree with many reviews written about Valley of the Dolls - it's an entertaining, quick read that you can get through in a couple of sittings. After reading that this book was perverse and shocking I couldn't wait to dig in. Unfortunately, compared to the no-holds-barred writing of some of today's writers, this book was tame - you're half way into the book before the ""dolls"" even come into the picture and any sex that goes on wouldn't even get a PG-13 rating. Jaqueline's writing style reminds me of the way that Jackie Collins' novels are set up - small chapters on each of the leading characters through out the book.All in all I did get through the book extremely quickly - I am mean it's two in the morning and I can't put it down! I was just disappointed with Anne's character, especially at the end of the book, no backbone at all..."
4,"ENTERTAINING, AND A PROFILE OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS!","Vally of the Dolls is a real look at the way some of the famous people live their lives. It portrayes the myth of good and evil in the world of making it to the top. In this book, we are looking at how stardom and money make or break the people. It's certainly a great look at courage, an power, and how differn't people use it."
5,Most entertaining book EVER!,"Reading ""Valley of the Dolls"" made me see what it's like to want to read a book over, and over, and over again. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down, and once you're finished you want more! As it says on the cover of the book, Valley of the Dolls is a Pop Culture classic, and shouldn't be missed. I couldn't believe that Ann, Neely and Jennifer weren't real people- though Ann is based on Jacqueline Susann's own experiences. If you want to find out the dirt behind the movie stars and entertainers of the 50's, or you just want to read a damn good book, Valley of the Dolls is for you!"
3,So different from the movie.,"After seeing Valley of the Dolls movie many years ago, I was very disappointed in the ending of the book. It just left me feeling empty."
4,Addictive,"This book hooks its readers in the same way that a B-movie hooks late-night movie watchers. What it lacks in literary flare it makes up for in character development and pace. A little time in the ""Valley"" was definitely more enjoyable than a late-night movie. I can understand why this book's readership is extensive."
5,Awesome U2 CD!!!!,I orogonially wasn't looking to buy this but it was on sale for $3.99!!! It has ALL of my favorite U2 songs!! THis is a must have for any greatest hits lover!!
3,Not many good songs,"I thought the CD had more songs that I liked. But since the used CD only cost me $4 (from a Salvation Army store), I'm satisfied with my purchase."
5,The best career spanning collection of the U2 catalog. This is truly the best of U2,"This the best career spanning collection of the U2 catalog. 18 of there best on one disc! If you are looking for a one disc set that will give you a good overview of U2's career I would recommend this set. Nice packaging, Great Music at a great price. 18 of the best for less than $10."
4,Very Good,"I think U2 has a huge selection of great songs, but they are one band that I think you need to buy the original album to appreciate the way it was crafted from first song to last. They are just not a greatest hits kind of band."
1,the money cash machine is at it again!,"Another U2 compilation! as if we need that again. They are becoming as disgusting as the rolling stones, less the talent. How many more times can we listen to all those repackaged ''edit''old hits. They haven't produced anything great since ''one''. They are now just of a corporation sucking the money of fans and recording mediocre albums. Remember ''atomic bomb''? what a waste! they're done musically but they are good at making money and marketing their lackluster products, totally sold out, all well pacakged under ''good samaritanism''. 1 star for the good old songs from ''war''-''unforgetable fire'' and ''joshua tree''"
4,18 singles,"AWESOME..................................... it has the best songs, great if you don't have money for 6 or 7 other albums. You don't need much more than this. It would be that much better if there we're a few older songs, like from Boy. also i wish The Unforgettable Fire(song) was on here."
5,Best concert to date,"I purchased this CD after going to see the U2 360 Tour at Soldier Field in Chicago on July 5, 2011, that concert was phenomenal, so I wanted to have the music to transport myself back to that night!"
4,Best for new fans,"I was introduced to U2's music in 2006 when one of the blogs that I liked referenced the song ""Desire."" This album was the first U2 record I bought. I did so after I watched some of their videos on YouTube. The songs on the album reflect what often comes to mind when one refers to U2, with hits like ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For."" However, the album does not include any songs from the previous LP's Boy, October, Zooropa, and Pop. For an introduction to U2, I feel that this album was helpful and I would suggest this album to new fans."
4,Surprised,I don't know often who sings a song I like but know the song when I hear it. I wanted to add some U2 to my collection and opted for this album over Joshua Tree. I was surprised by some of the songs I thought other artist sung that it turns out U2 did. They have a wide range in style and that is brought out by this album. I would recommend this to anyone wanting some good music to add to their general playlist of music.
3,Good Songs; Lousy Rip,"I was very much looking forward to listening to this collection, especially at the excellent MP3Deal price.It turns out Amazon's rip is lousy. So tin-ey I didn't even finish listening to the whole album before I gave up. Unfortunately, ""all digital download sales are final"" so if you get a crappy product you're out of luck. Fortunately, this is the first time I've gotten bad digital content from Amazon and hopefully it won't happen again."
3,Not looking for the radio edits,"I bought this CD, assuming that the songs listed on here would be included in their entirety. I owned the 80's compilation and several songs were cut short on that and I was hoping that would not be the case on this album. I guess that was too much to ask though. ""New Years Day"" and ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" are both cut short on this. They even include the lyrics for the last verse of ""New Years Day"" in the album jacket, but the don't include that part of the song! For those of you who enjoy those two songs (only two of U2's biggest hits, I might add), you'll have to purchase the ""Joshua Tree"" and ""War"" album if you want to hear the entire song."
2,What?,"Ok, where is ""Even better than the real thing""? where's ""Lemon"" (the remix)? I can't find ""Who's gonna ride your wild horses"". Does this cd have ""Bad"" on it? Where's the classic ""When love comes to town""? ""All along the watchtower"" was a good tune, but this cd doesn't have it. I am also very surprised that this cd doesn't have ""Angel of Harlem"". ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" (live version) was great but it's no where to be found on this cd. Granted the singles are on here, but if I can recall, ""Even better..."" and ""Angel.."" were singles. Bono needs to get out of Africa for a couple of days, sit down infront of the computer and really read some of these reviews."
2,poor business,"Paid for a new item,but received a ued,unwraped (cellophane),scratched,warped,CD container.Will not buy from them again. Thank You,but no thank you."
1,Whatever!!!,"The fact that people still follow a band no matter what they put out, is why this was released. U2 are the new Stones! They will continue to release rubbish and tour for it til they die; and people will continue to buy it and call it great. I do notsay these things because I do not like U2; but I will not follow any band, no matter how much I like them, if they start to release mediocre albums. Rumor has it that they almost broke up after R&H, and in my opinion they should have. Their first 5 albums are great, Achtung Baby was okay, and it just goes down the toilet from there. If U2 or Island records want to cash in on this music again, they need to get with the times and remaster their back catalog or even remix some things in 5.1 surround. The dvd companion of this compilation would be marginally worth it if the videos are in surround; but I have not heard that this is the case. Move on people! U2 are not what they were...deal with it!"
5,U2U18 Good Music Good Memories,This is for all of us who remember Bono before his entry into the International Activism scene. The greatest hits of one of the greatest bands.
3,"What about a box set for non ipod owners or ""Essential""?","To me, this collection is targeting the Xmas crowd and casual fans who want the big hits on one CD, and later fans who got into them from 2000 on, due to 9 out of 18 being from past 6 years. I don't think it's a great representation of their best songs and the 2 new songs would've been better for something else, maybe a 4 track EP (which they used to do).I'd love to see them launch more archive stuff, and even though the DVD has some 1980-1990 material, they have never put out a DVD for that era.I guess the ipod owners who bought the U2 ipod with ""The Complete U2"" will just add the 2 songs and be set. It's still U2, it's still good and as a stocking stuffer would be a nice thing, but longtime U2 fans will want it for the 2 songs and to add to the collection, but I doubt would get much play in comparison to ""Joshua Tree"" and ""Achtung Baby""."
3,Enough is Enough!!!!!!!!,"As per previous comments, I too am a huge U2 fan and will continue to buy all released material, however buying this album didn't come with the usual sense of excitement that I've felt in the past. They should've called this album ""U2 Radio Edits"" or ""U2 For The Average Fan"" as it is simply a regurgitated version of their other ""best of"" albums. U2 needs to release a ""best of"" album that truly appeals to the die hard fan, the ones that spend the big bucks on tickets and travel across the country to see them live. Here's my idea for what they should've put on a second album, called ""U2 18 - The Lost Songs"": Red Hill Mining Town, Kite, Gone, Please, Exit, Bad, 40, So Cruel, Love is Blindness, Running to Stand Still, Stay, Zooropa, The First Time, Wake Up Dead Man, Acrobat, Bullet the Blue Sky, Love Rescue Me & The Unforgettable Fire...........Now this album I would've been excited about. Just my ideas, not yours............That's it."
5,Perfect 80's score!,I just bought an Ipod and I was compiling an 80's playlist. How could I forget about U2? This definitely rounded out my collection. Thanks!
4,Good compilation,This will probably be one of many more U2 Greatest Hits collections to be released in the future and Bono & Company will just keep that cash rolling in.
4,boppin beej,One of my favorite bands. This album contains many of my favorites and a few others that I've never heard before. It beats having to program my CD player or burn a mixed CD.
2,U2 Marketing Blunder,"I've been an avid U2 goer for decades, seen them live in concert 3 times & bought a myriad of their CDs over said time. When I 1st heard of this latest greatest from them, I was excited to think that I could carry just ONE CD vs. the usual 3, in order to have all of my favorites on hand @ the same time. HOWEVER, my excitement was short-lived!I don't know if the marketing team for this group could actually be so ignorant or if they just couldn't bother rewarding their long-time die-hard fans with a TRULY Best of Hits Collection! So, now on to the crux of my plight... In lieu of tracks 8, 15, 16, 17 & 18, they should have at the very least included ""I Will Follow"" & ""Angel Of Harlem""! Others, such as ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"" & ""Zooropa"" would have been bonuses!In FACT, the particular song line up on this CD has cost it countless sales, for the simple absence of some of its timeless gems being replaced with some NO name of songs!"
3,A pretty decent compilation for casual fans,"I can honestly say that I am not a big fan of U2. I fail to see the hoopla over one of the most overrated bands in the past two decades. I will admit that the band has put out some good songs over the years. J218 is perfect for casual listeners of U2 like myself. All of my favorite U2 songs are from the 1980s. Songs like ""Without or Without You"" and ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" still sounds amazingly fresh and never dated. I can never get tired of listening to the band's songs from the '80s. The '90s and'00s is another story. The only songs I did like from the past decade is ""One"", ""Walk On"" and ""Stuck in a Moment"". Everything else was rubbish for me. I make no apologies when I say that I hated the song the band did with Green Day ""The Saints Are Coming"". What a horrid track. I'm glad I didn't pay anything for this cd which contains too much filler songs for my liking."
3,U2 18 Singles,It was a good CD... but what I found out is that I only know a few of U2's musical offerings... those heard most often... most of singles I was unaware of and just thought of them as O.K.
3,"A ""Subsidy"" to their last The Best of 1990-2000","If you are not a hardcore fans, then you may skip this cd, or just wait for their next BEST of 2000-2010."
5,"Another ""Best Of""","I get it beacuse of the two new song, The Saints Are coming and Windows in the sky, but the rest I dont care."
4,"Has Nirvana's greatest hits, but no more","Why I'm disappointed in this box set is because although it has such classics as ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", ""In Bloom"" and ""Heart-Shaped Box"" it does not have other singles like ""Love Buzz"", ""Sliver"", ""About a Girl"" and ""Pennyroyal Tea"". This album does, however have the other songs that appeared on singles like on the SLTS one it had ""Aneurysm"" live and ""Even in his Youth"". Nirvana is awesome with many simple, yet adrenaline pumping songs that blow your mind and on this one, it's the most mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping songs. Buy the box-set if you love Nirvana, or even if you just really like them."
3,normal,"im glad with the purchase, you cannot expect a lot from a vitamin.. it works , and has an acceptable expiration date."
1,Garbage,I just have to say that it is sad that the Rock On 1980 CD only got two stars while this one got 4 1/2 stars! The 1980 one is far superior to this one.
4,The definitive modern work on the Japanese Tea Tradition,"This scholarly work first examines the discovery & establishment of tea & tea culture in China, in particular the profound influence of Lu Yu in developing a Chinese tea tradition. The remainder of the book is devoted to explaining the development of the peculiarly Japanese tea culture which grew from Chinese beginnings following tea's introduction to Japan from China during the Tang Dynasty. The book is well illustrated with some superb full colour plates, and a number of black & white photographs.The author is the fifteenth generation tea-master entrusted with preserving the history and practising the art of the Japanese tea traditions."
5,Great Deal,For the price I paid $7.99 ea this truly is a great deal I am using them for monitor hook ups and they work great.If they get damaged at the gig they are cheap enough to replace.
2,"Oh Uwe, you did it again","Blubberella is Uwe Boll almost at his finest...or his worst. An overly offensive spoof that tries to hard at what it does, Boll's Blubberella is extreme badness, but surprisingly watchable here and there. Using the same scenes, actors, and sets from BloodRayne 3, Boll presents the tale of an obese human/vampire (Lindsay Hollister) as she fights Nazis and her own girth. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it definitely isn't, sometimes you'll just hang your head in shame and wonder just why you're watching this. All that aside however, there's been much worse to come out of Uwe Boll over the years, but chances are if you're reading this review on this page for this movie, then you already know what you're in for with Blubberella. Bring extra beer."
5,Perfect Mobile,"I just registered for this mobile. It matches the bedding set I choose for my baby's nursey. You do have to keep winding it up, but thats true with most mobiles. I picked this one over a remote controlled mobile because, I really wanted the one that matched the Soft & Fuzzy Pooh bedding set."
5,Beyond category,"When Pogorelich did not make the finals of the 1980 Warsaw Competition (where they play exclusively Chopin), his response was to sign with Deutsche Grammophone for his first recording and he made it an all-Chopin affair. From his stunning opening take on Chopin's Sonata #2, to a Funeral March restored to its grandeur, to the breaktaking final moments of the Scherzo #3, Pogorelich announced to the music world that he'd arrived. He has sadly recorded far too little in his career; listen to this magical recording and be astonished."
3,"Never quite a thriller, never quite a comedy...","Voyou aka The Crook/Simon the Swiss is one of Claude Lelouch's more polished efforts, reuniting him with Un Homme et Une Femme star Jean-Louis Trintignant in a good-looking number that's never quite a thriller, never quite a comedy and never quite a drama but which still passes the time pleasingly enough. The anarchy pretty much begins and ends with the striking opening musical number and a central flashback sequence that's so clumsily placed it takes you a good 20 minutes to realise you're watching a flashback, and it is difficult to root for a crook who kidnaps a small child (especially in light of recent events in the UK and Portugal), but it's not at all bad if you're in the right mood for it."
3,Mildly Arresting,"This is a cocktail that's part tense criminal portrait and part light-hearted caper served in a lushly romantic but referential style and at a pace that can charitably be described as leisurely. It's stylish and at times fascinating, but I was at a remove the whole time. This may be because I don't see the charm of Jean-Louis Trintignant -- to me he's just creepy. (Lelouch has fun posing him smoking on his bed, but he's no Alain Delon.)Worth watching if you're in the mood for something colorful but decidedly low-key."
1,"Good fit , but velcro clings to shirt with every step! ARGH!","My Creative Zen fits the product well, but they've put velcro on 2 sides - meaning that when attached to my arm, it also sticks to my shirt with every step! HOW AGGRAVATING!"
3,"fits well, unnecessary extra velcro","This band fits well and holds either my blackberry or my ipod snuggly. The only issue is that there is superfluous velcro on the outside of the band, so it sticks to my shirt. What's up with that?"
3,A servicable Product,The sport band does what is is supposed to do - transport your ipod/iphone on your wrist.
3,Did the job for 6 months,"I used this product with a 5th gen 60 GB iPod video. The iPod fit snug into the pocket and never fell out. The material felt comfortable around my arm. However, through normal sweat and wear and tear on the product (I work out 2 to 3 times a week), the stitches started coming off on the pocket. It's a good product but with enough sweating it will start to come loose. I guess it was a decent buy at a cheap price, but don't expect this to last more than a year."
4,ok for the price,"Its a 4 only because the price is right, but you get what you pay for. It is a universal arm band so it will probably only fit the bigger zunes well, as for the HD's works but little sloppy.."
4,"Reliable product, I recommend it","I got this so I would be able to keep my phone on my arm, since I can't keep it in my pocket at work due to the activities in the warehouse. It works great for flip phones, I know that. The only downside that I have experienced is that when you sweat, it slips down your arm unless you have it strapped on tight. When it is strapped on tight, it may inhibit bloodflow or cause a heat rash if you are performing rigorous manual labor. I think its an excellent product though based on my experience. I've been using it for a few weeks now and it is very durable. It is also machine washable, which is good since the material absorbs sweat and skin. The strap is a combination of velcro and nylon I believe, adjustable to different sized arms and ankles."
1,Not What I expected!,This arm band has velcro on the OUTSIDE whick rubs against your body! This arm band shredded my brand new shirt and when I tried to turn it a different direction it rubbed against my skin and made it raw no matter which way I turn it. I would NOT recommend this product. This is not a reflection on the seller. The seller sent the arm band very quickly & it was a smooth transaction.
5,?,I am not sure how this worked. It was stolen from my car 2 days after I bought it and before I had the chance to use it once. It looked like good quality and that it would work. The Zen Vision M did at least fit in it.
2,Sure Shot Missed,"I too was disappointed in the Canon Sure Shot. Mainly, the pictures are not as sharp and crisp as I had hoped; and the indoor pictures have never come out that great. The metal piece on the front that protects the lens FELL off (discovered after the fact, so it was too late to find where it had fallen off), so now I get ""light leaks"". I will probably not buy a Canon camera again--and will go back to an Olympus."
4,works just fine,"This air filter stayed one year in my 2003 Prius and still looked pretty new. I would occasionally take it out, tap it on the driveway, and then run my shop-vac across it. I guess I'll get another one. It seems strange to give five stars to a product this simple - what could it do that is exceptional? So I think four stars will be just right."
4,"The best part of this CD-Single is not ""You Learn""...","While ""You Learn"" is a good track, the real jewel of this disc is the addition of the live accoustic version of ""You Oughta Know"" that Alanis performed during the (I believe) 1996 Music Awards. It is by far the best version I have ever heard and well worth the cost. A must-have for Alanis fans."
2,Microsoft Only & Not Enough Detail,"I have two major complaints: 1. Basically, all the client-side scripts are written in VBScript. Why? I write all my client-side material in JavaScript so it is more widely supported! This is what I mean be Microsoft only -- It's fine if you want to use onyl Microsoft on your server & development end, but be realistic and expect other users once your system is in place.2. The best example I can give for the instructional style is this: If you were teaching someone how to drive, would you just tell them that the brake pedal makes you slow down and the accelerator makes you speed up? The book is like that in many places, talking about how button 'x' does 'x', without ever explaining WHAT 'x' is or WHY you might want to use it. It's contradictory -- the book assumes too much to be for a novice user, but it re-treads so much ground on VBScript and DHTML that it makes no sense for advanced users..."
3,"Covers the basic quite well, but...","This book is typical example of ""Learn-the-basic-but-not-serious-business"". I mean, you can learn the basics on this book, but if you do enterprise applications (as I do) you still have a long way to go..."
3,Leasurely walk through Web Programming with VI6 Perspective,Its a nice walk and a fast read (two weekends are sufficien). At the end you've got a much better idea what VI might do for you. Still if you are the only expert at the company (who isn't?) you still have a lot of work. Especially I liked the treatment of design time controls. Though I still have the fealing there is still much more power in it. Probably one has to go through the script library (provided in source code with VI) to find out.
4,Great book to learn VID,"I took the Microsoft Class for VID, and didn't understand one thing. This book cleared everything up with it easy to understand examples. But, if you really want to learn it, than you have to be working on a computer while you read it."
3,"Errors early on, but gets better later in the book","By itself, I found this book very frustrating in the beginning. Then I openned Visual InterDev 6 Bible which is great in the first two thirds and goes downhill from there. The two books together work very well. I would have liked alot more on Design-Time Controls and Active X controls. I get the feeling that since InterDev 6 is just off the shelves, we will have to wait to get a really good in-depth book on these controls."
2,The Little Reference Book that couldn't,"I work for the Federal Government... so naturally, I get a lot of exposure to documents that look good on the surface but, once you look under the covers... you're still in the dark! When I picked up this book, I thought it was going to be substative, and for those who are new to Active Server Pages, the book gives a decent intro (although it doesn't show expected (user presented)) outputs. But, if you are new to ASP and want a good intro, you are better off going with ""Professional Active Server Pages 2.0"" by Wrox Press. On the issue of VID 6.0, the book is sorely lacking. The numerous tables of ""three word definitions"" that were referred to be a previous reviewer becomes increasingly annoying, the more you get into the book... sort of like eating stuffed clams and getting only ""bread crumbs""!"
4,Extremely Concise,"For those already comfortable with the general technologies, this book is an excellent source of VI6 information. This book provides better coverage of design-time controls than any other book I've read.If you have no coding experience and are looking for an in-depth turorial, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, get your hands on this book! An excellent value."
1,Not worth reading,"This book discusses a lot of mundane HTML stuff without even getting into the guts of VI6. It is spattered with screen dumps, and snippets of code that really don't teach you much.Save your money and buy something else."
1,Visual Interdev 6 -- From the Ground Down!,"I had this book for a college class where we used Visual InterDev 6. I walked in the first day of the quarter with no knowledge of the program, and if the class had been based solely on this book I would have walked out with no more than I went in with. Anytime I needed help while working on a Web project in InterDev, I could never find the answers in here. This book is so basic, I wonder how he got his Software Designer position that the cover says he has. For what it's worth, this book is not the one that you want to buy when you want to LEARN about the program. If you want something that will take up some empty space on your bookshelf, then go ahead and get this. If you read it once, the bookshelf is probably where it will stay."
2,I am going to have to find another VI book!,"Visual Interdev does a lot of things, but it's main strength is to help build data centeric web pages or web pages that transact with databases. My major beef with this book is that there is no code on how to connect and open a database. Lots on SQL, ODBC, DTC but if I can't connect and open a database, the other stuff is useless."
1,Don't buy this book unless you need only very basic info,"Unless you are completely new to programming for the web and Microsofts way of doing things, don't buy this book.It covers only the very basics of writing web applications with Visual Interdev, and goes into absolutely no advanced topics. Most of the book is just screen dumps or listing of object properties and methods - nothing you couldn't find out by playing with VI itself.Apart from that, it's not up-to-date: Three chapters are spend on ODBC, with ADO only getting 10 very superficial pages.Most of the book - apart from the screen shots and the properties lists - are in the format: Right click the mouse to bring up a context menu; drag your mouse to the icon, etc. Very basic stuff newbies to Windows might need to be told, but hopefully no programmer should need this.This book told me nothing, I didn't already know (and I bought this book because I wanted to learn VI) - it's not worth the money!"
2,Open this book as a Novice and Finish it as a Novice,This book wastes a lot of paper and ink repeating the same sentence fragments: This section demonstrates... This functionality is illustrated... Let us consider an example... Our next example... The source code is shown in the following listing... Position your mouse... and over and over and over ad nauseum. Quite boring and dry. The one good thing I liked about this book is that it has a lot of screenshots. It's like a picture book with short boring explanations.
2,There isn't very much information,"This book touches a little of everything, but doesn't ever expanding on any one topic. I wouldn't even recommend this as a beginners book....."
2,Not very helpful,"The only section I found useful was the chapter on design time controls. The examples are fairly basic, but good if this is your first time using Visual InterDev. If you have nothing else (Microsoft Press books are duplication of the online information - much more readable though), then try this book. Better off waiting for the upcoming books..."
1,@$#&^*!,"I bought this camera in July 2003. It stopped working October 2003. To be more specific, the display on the back went on the fritz. Canon suggested we remove the battery & try to reset the memory. No luck. So I will be sending it in for a warranty repair. I'll let you know how I make out.Well, it cost [$$$] to ship it to Canon. Now they want [$$$] to fix it. [...] So I don't recommend this camera nor will I replace it with a Canon."
4,Wonderful music marred by uneven recording...,"I originally purchased this CD solely because it has the beautiful Handel harp concerto, but there is actually a lot of beautiful music here, and from many genres. For example, the harp concerto by Boieldieu is actually impressionist music.However, since this is a compilation of various recordings, the results can be inconsistent. For example, the Bach piece sounds very compressed. Yes, it was recorded in analog format, but today's digital processing can actually clean up a lot of noise and expand the dynamic range. The Bach piece has tonal emphasis in the wrong places and an overall murky sound. It is the piece that suffers the most in this set.The largos and adagios tend to be soft, muted and relaxing. These pieces can serve very nicely as background music for guests having dinner or just sharing time. In fact, by using harp concertos instead of solo harp, this compilation provides a more rounded musical experience thanks to some rich orchestration."
4,Very interesting,"I mostly bought this book because I heard it mentioned my favourite manga, From Eroica With Love. I don't know much about fandom in Japan and I overall found it very interesting, a good read and I felt I learned a lot. I can't judge the content much apart from that I enjoyed reading it - the part about Eroica seems correct, though."
4,The First Good Solution for Desktop Phone Bluetooth,"First off, I'm very hard on my phones. So 4 stars from me may be 5 from other people.The headset base has a pasthrough to your corded phone. You plug the telephone cord from your wal into the base, then another cord out from the base goes into the main phone. So, this does work with every phone.The sound quality is good. It's on par with ost headsets, but I have heard better. If you're reasonable about your expectations for a Bluetooth headset, you'll be happily surprised with the quality.The only problem I have is that it does sometimes take a couple tries to get the headset to kick in. I'm usually on the phone and then swith to headset, so it's not a huge deal, but it could be better.One thing most people won't like is the size. I actually like the size of this headset vs. the small, hang off your ear headset.Overall, this is a great first step in Bluetooth for the desk phone."
5,Love it,"I've had this for a couple of months now, and I love it. Good points include: comfort over several hours of wear, consistently good sound on both ends and long battery life. Bad points include: headband only fits small heads and difficulty connecting the first time since the multi-function button is squirrelly."
2,"too much static, poor customer service","there's way too much noise and choppiness on this device.BlueParrot's customer service folks were worthless, at one point telling me I needed a ""wifi filter"" if I was near any wifi networks (I think they got confused and thought they were recommending a DSL filter, but I don't have DSL. And good luck finding a square foot of space in a modern city that doesn't have nearby wifi traffic."
1,Not What I Expected,"Don Redman was a lesser known big band leader from the 20's and 30's who also wrote some great songs (Gee Baby Ain't I Good To You), NONE of which are on this weak and lifeless CD. I bought this disc because it was a 50's small ensemble session featuring some great swinging sidemen (Coleman Hawkins, Sweets Edison, Jo Jones) but it is nothing like I expected. The tunes - mostly Redman compositions - are forgettable, the arrangements worse and most of all...it doesn't swing but merely bounces along like a 30's ""sweet"" band. On one tune the melody is actually wistled. Not recommended."
3,"A Good book, but flawed by Twitchell's dishonesty","After reading ""Confessions of a God Seeker"" by Ford Johnson I now view all of Twitchell's writings with a pound of salt. Although, Twitchell has made the thoughts, words, and experiences of others his own, there is still useful information here.Normally, I would have given this book a higher rating, but the difficulty in determining where the origional source of this information left off and Twitchell's ""creative imagination"" began makes much of the information in the book suspect. Still, there is information contained within this book that is helpful to any Soul consciously beginning or continuing their Inner journey. Just pay attention, and beware of the dogma."
2,Received wrong item,"I ordered the ""Brutus"" Beanie Baby for my son, to replace one he has had for 5 years, that goes everywhere with us and has traveled internationally. I ordered the ""standing"" Brutus, but was sent the Brutus laying down, and the result has been less than pleasant. As it is obviously not the same beanie, we are having problems ""connecting"" with it."
5,Leary at his best,Denis Leary gets right to the point. This is not for the faint of heart or sensitive type. His candor and cynicism is unmatched. He gets right to the truth of the matter. Loved it.
4,Still funny,"There's two kinds of ripping of. Good and bad.Bad# Rage Against the Machine ripped off the Urban Dance Squad and got away with it.# Pat Boone and all the other white singers doing black songs in the 50's# That show with Rob Schneider v Men Behaving BadlyGood# Fountains of Wayne writing Beatles songs# American Office v the Original# Star Wars v Kurosawa movies# Denis Leary doing Bill Hicks.Some jokes are copied exactly, but I knew Leary before Hicks and I have to say it still cracks me up, even though I know see the late Hicks was better and more original.It's funny though, the bits about smoking, children, cancer etc. If you want a good laugh and are not too bothered with the ripping off, get it"
4,Complete Denis Leary review,"Its a pretty good dvd, allways fun to heard the stuff from No cure for cancer and lock 'n load"
2,Leary Stand Up - Not Funny,Enjoyed Leary's Rescue Me and The Job so much but was really disappointed in his stand up - not funny and over done.
2,"Deal with it, he ripped off Hicks","Why do you think Leary doesn't do live shows anymore? Hicks isn't around for him to steal material from!And that is precisely what Leary did. He took Bill's material, excised anything controversial and intelligent (as in all of Bill's political work), added more profanity to attract the ignorant, and once again proved that the path to success in the entertainment industry is not achieved by providing meaningful material, rather it is done by appealing to the lowest common denominator."
1,very misleading listing,"this book was listed as ""used - very good"". in fact, the dust jacket is torn and about 30% covered with a dark brown stain, certain interior pages also have 30% coverage of a dark brown stain, and the book smells very musty or moldy. I will not be able to keep it in my house, so my bad choices are to pay money to send it back or just throw it away. (I gave a rating of one star because the system would not accept a zero star rating.)"
5,Answer for my Heart's Loss,"Dr. Boss's book landed in my hands quite by accident, at a time when my closest friend moved away. I was devistated, and I was totally unprepared to deal with my emotional and psychological reactions to the situation simply because I didn't understand the reasons for them. Dr. Boss helped me see my grief as natural and normal, and gave me a footing to rebuild on. The stories of immigrants were most affective in my case; but other stories of ambiguous loss situations also helped me to deal with my ex-husband, and with my father's slow death. I have come to realize also all the little ambiguous losses we live with everyday. They are not death; they are part of life."
5,Ambiguous Loss,"I didn't even know this sort of grief had a name. Emotions are so confusing. Thank you for this book. I also have used a grief journal, Write from Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal to help me heal. It helps to write my feelings down."
3,Great Singers Great Opera Lousy Recording!,"I have no issues with the singing, there are excellent singers here and this is a great opera. The late Giussepe Sinopoli was an excellent conductor. My problem is with the recording which is of low volume. Yes, you can crank up the volume but the recording also suffers from 1980's Digititis. It literally sticks pins and needles in my ears! I wish DG would remaster this recording. Three stars due to the recording. Five stars for the singing and conductintg."
2,Just the facts and little else,"No great moment by moment accounts here,only an overview of what units and divisions were where and what happened to them.Very brief combat accounts such as "" they were heavily engaged before being pushed back to the river Bug"" are most of what you will find along with an some short equipment notes such as "" a hetzer group of 12 units was added until sent elswhere"" Not what I was hoping for after reading books like ""HELLS GATE"" and ""TIGERS IN THE MUD"".The most interesting part is a sideline about the Slovack uprising at the time and it's key players.This book does suffer from some translation problems that do not improve it's flow.Treat this as reference material not the defining account of the end of Army Group Center.Maybe Douglas Nash can tell this story next..."
2,expert on books from Whermacht prespective,"I hate to be negative about a book from the German prespective, as they are rare, but I feel I must for others not to wastetheir money. The book is a general and basic operationaloverview of the end stages of combat in the Silesia area. If youare only looking for dates, places, and names of units involvedthis book is for you but, if you are like me, there are ZEROpersonal accounts included, which are needed to ""flesh"" out abook like this, to give you a better understanding of the various battles described."
2,Maybe it's poorly translated,"On the first page the author claims that the withdrawal of the SS Pz Korps upon the termination of Citadel left a gaping hole in the German front that the Soviets promptly poured through, leading to the collapse east of the Dneiper. He goes on to say that, in one action or another, many Soviet tanks were knocked out by Stukas, some at close range. What is close range for a stuka?"
5,One heck of an adventure tale!!,"Not your usual ""shipwreck"" book, this gripping story tells of a ship stopped dead in the middle of the Atlantic, during the last days of the First World War, when a serious illness strikes the crew. I literally read the last half of the book in one stretch - I couldn't put it down. A great story if you love tales of the sea."
4,It's a classic,"Hi,Divine! You never heard of 'em ? Well, move along; but for the rest of us who grew up to Love Reaction, Native Love, and You think you're a man, then you may have a penchant for adding this to your collection. It brings together the well known cuts but with the apparent lack of ""You think you're a man""."
5,"Will encourage young women to go into the ""mans' world""","I have experience in a lot of the fields mentioned in this book. The photographs and history behind them by Shirley Burman makes the women of yesteryear come alive again in my mind!! I thououghly enjoyed this book, and encourage others to read it. After 27 years on the railroad, there was a lot I learned from this book... Thanks, Shirley and Nancy.....!!!"
5,Sublime!,"Easily one of the best ""La Traviata"" recordings EVER if not THE best. A perfect cast, and everything about this recording is simply beautiful in every way. A must-have in the collections of all opera lovers!"
5,La Traviata is amazing!,"When I was a teenager, I first heard of ""La Traviata"" from the hit movie Pretty Woman. When I began music school, I worked at a music library and found this opera among our collection. We happened to have the best version of all in my opinion with Milnes and Cotrubas. I immediately fell in love with it. Words cannot even begin to describe the beauty in Cotrubas's soprano voice. Her ability to sing fast passages amazes me and she has been quite a vocal inspiration to me for quite some time. Milnes' voice is quite full and sings straight into your soul. In my opinion, there is no other recording of ""La Traviata."""
5,This is it!!,"Let me try to save you some money and some hand wringing. I'm no expert reviewer, but I just dropped a bunch of money buying the top 10 rated Traviatas on Amazon. If you only want to buy ONE Traviata and listen to it over and over and never tire of hearing it, THIS IS IT. As you can tell from other reviewers, there are critics who can find imperfections in just about anything, but IMHO this Traviata is as close to perfection as it's going to get. Ileana Cotrubas is Violetta. BUY THIS TRAVIATA and listen to it over and over and take yourself out to a great dinner with the money you save from buying the other nine that I bought. Everyone on this recording sounds wonderful. Enjoy."
5,A Great version,"La TraviataGiuseppe Verdi - musicFrancesco Maria Piave - librettoCarlos KleiberBayerisches StaatsorchesterBayerischer Staatsopernchor - Wolfgang BaumgartIleana Cotrubas - Violetta ValeryStefania Malagu - Flora BervoixHelena Jungwirth - AnninaPlacido Domingo - Alfredo GermontSherrill Milnes - Giorgio GermontWalter Gullino - GastoneBruno Grella - Barone DoupholAlfredo Giacomotti - Marchese d'ObignyGiovanni Foiani - Dottore GrenvilWalter Gullino - GiuseppePaul Friess - Domestico di FloraPaul Winter - Commissionario(Deutsche Grammophon - ADD - 1977 - digital remix)This is a great version. Not only does Ileana Cotrubas sing well throughout, her voice is perfectly suited to the character. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well.This is a solid Five Star presentation."
2,Mr. Gasket 2662,"I used this Mr. Gasket water neck/outlet on a 1996 Ford E150, everything align okay except the water outlet and pump hoses aren't same size."
3,Ska + Hymns= Ska Hymns,"If you grew up listening to hymns, and you're ready for something fresh, this is for you. Good CD, good song choices. Sometimes the songs can drag a little, but that's from a guy who likes skate punk at blistering tempos always. The upbeat parts of the songs are great, there's just too many slow breakdown sections in nearly all the tunes. But hey, it beats the message of most ska bands, and it beats the boring out of the organ hymns!"
4,Awesome music,"This is a really great CD with some truly awesome music. I had heard some of these songs in church, and to hear them set to ska blew me away. I only gave this a 4 out of 5 because it has a couple of annoying things, such as this weird doo-wop music in this one song, and a sort-of-annoying rendition of ""I got the Joy"" (these, plus a version of ""Awesome God"" makes a total of three songs that I'm not too fond of-- pretty good track record for a CD, if you ask me). Also, at the end of track 11 there's a few minutes of silence, which is annoying if you want the CD to repeat. Ah well! Overall, very cool CD, a lot of fun to listen to, and maybe a way to show your friends that Christian music can rock."
3,Pump up the jam!,This CD makes praise and worship fun. I really felt the power of God while listening. It's praise lyrics and edgy ska sound make this CD a must for rockers for Jesus! I can't wait for Skalleluia Too!
4,This is TOO COOL!,"I believe I heard the track ""He Has Made Me Glad"" this Spring on a road trip, and I thought: ""That's kind of cool."" Then I came across this in a used CD store, listened to it, bought it, and have been listening to it for two days straight now. DEFINITELY a change of pace for worship music. I'm not a big fan of CCM - Contemporary Christian Music - or typical Praise & Worship music, but this disc (as an old worship song says) ""set my feet a dancin'!"" GET IT!"
4,Skalleluia,"I first ran across some Insyderz MP3s while trying to find some MxPx (a long time fan). The first track I ever heard from them was ""In The Secret"" and I was hooked. These guys do some great stuff with the classic songs that we grew up singing in church and at camps and retreats. Lord, I Lift Your Name on High gives us both sides - a nice traditional version and then jumps into a real ska/punk version of the song. Draw Me Close is practically reggae, but it keeps you interested in Jesus.Why 4 stars?:These guys do some great work with making some of our favorite songs a ska/punk classic. These will keep your toes tapping while your praying and are just good, clean fun. Plus, these guys really know how to rock! I just wish this disc had more songs on it!"
5,sing worship songs to ska/punk!!!,if you are tired of worship songs lacking the energy to praise God then this cd is for you. Not only is it ska/punk music but it is all your favorite worship music. It livens up all thbise songs. This cd is constantly in my cd player and I always have the urge to sing them this way all the time. I would say a must get cd for all punk/ska lovers!!!
5,its hot!!,this cd is one of the best christian cd's i have. some songs on this cd we sing at our youth group like lord i lift your name on high. this is an awesome cd and everyone should get it!
5,It is truly one of the BEST!,"One of my friends got me hooked on the cd, and I haven't stopped listening to it since! If you don't have it all ready, I suggest that you get it as soon as possible!!!!"
2,Just a photo book.,"Very disappointed with this book. There is no information you can use for your garden or in your future work. There is no info in hardiness, preferences, usage of the plants in landscape etc. Yes, good photos , but this is all."
5,DVD's,"We have loved Charlie Chan movies for years and used to watch them when our kids were little. Great price for 4 movies. Much less than in town at a video store. Fast shipping. Thanks, Amazon."
4,Another great Chan collection,I've always enjoyed the Chan mysteries and this adds another group of movies that I have been wanting to add to my collection
2,package feedback,The package arrived with two CHARLIE CHAN in RENO dvd's and no CHARLIE CHAN at TREASURE ISLAND. I requested a replacement order and the same issue happened again. Now trying to contact the manufacturer to resolve the problem since Amazon can't. Other than that the movies I did receive were good.
4,Charlie Chan Collection Volume 4,"Fox raises its exemplary restoration of the classic detective series to something approaching pristine condition, offering 4 features starring,for the first time, Sidney Toler, who makes a credible Chan. Included are the inexplicably well regarded ""Treasure Island"",with its tacky spiritualist elements, and the rarely seen ""City of Darkness"",set in a prewar Paris composed of stock footage and backlot locations.""Honolulu"" and ""Reno"" are formulaic Chan melodramas which rely on artificially created locational atmosphere but all 4 films are mercifully free of the racist humor that would stain later entries in this series.The extras and commentaries are, as always, intriguing."
4,"Charlie Chan, Vol 4","Charlie Cahn, Vol 4 is a good set of films to introduce Sidney Tolar who repalced Werner Oland upon his death. It shows his first movie in the role and the stiffness which he played the part. Then in the subsequent films he fills the role with ease. And, the Number 1 son has been replaced by Number 2 son. Here the actor finds his way in replaceing Key Luke and making the role his own. I look forward to VOl. 5 and 6 that will cotinue the series."
5,Paradise in a box !,"I have to admit, the early Chans with Warner Oland are still the best. But when it comes down to it, The restorations, bonus features (especially the re-enactment of Charlie Chans' Courage) and still galleries are enough alone to purchase these box sets (this is the 1st box set with Sidney Toler-the 2nd REAL Chan) They are, to put it simply, just like when they 1st came out at the theater. I dare say better !! Because of the fantastic restoration abilities, these are almost perfect. If you are a ""who-dunnit"" fan, you simply must try the Charlie Chan series out. Those of us who have (I'm pretty sure I am not alone on this..) are just as excited as all get out to have the rest come out, Those of you who have'nt have an awfully nice treat ahead..this is the 4th box set they have released, I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting the rest..C'MON 20TH CENTURY FOX !!!!"
3,Typical SBrown,Enjoyable for its entertainment value. Other travel videos give you a different and perhaps better flavor for desired tourist destinations.
4,Great Travel DVD! (But Sadly NO Closed Caption or Subtitles),"I personally enjoy Samantha's bubbly approach to travel. However, if you're on a budget and are looking for tips on thrifty travel- you might want to look to Rick Steves (his dvd series; or his yearly ""Europe Through The Back Door"" book series). Samantha definitely indulges in the finer aspects of travel (specifically when it comes to what hotels she stays in). Despite that, I find her travel series unique and informative.Now, the reason for my 4 star rating: I've watched this, and the France/Italy DVD with my hearing impaired grandmother. Sadly, there was NO closed caption, or even subtitles for her to read! I'm pretty certain that the episodes that air on the Travel Channel are CC; and subtitles are pretty standard on all DVD's. Anyway, I just thought I'd mention this for those hearing impaired folks who are contemplating on whether or not to purchase this."
1,Focused too much on the narrator and not enough on the country,"This DVD spent way too much time on the woman narrating and not enough on the sites. I guess that would be OK if you wanted to buy a video of her, but I was expecting a video of England and Scotland. Also, I found it strange that she was saying that one of the places she visited in London she normally wouldn't go to because of safety, but why would she include it on her video. I would shop around for a better video guide."
2,Trite and Silly,"This is not a serious effort, rather it's aimed at the mass viewing audience and is rather dumbed down. Brown is more worried about her clothes, the look of a hotel room that no one can afford, or whether someone calls her a ""Lass"" or not, instead of providing any meaningful or useful travel insights. Entertaining? Sure. As much as watching COPS or a police chase on CNN. Useful? No."
3,"Passport to Europe: England, Ireland and Scotland",I gave this series to my daughter who intends to take her first overseas extended world trip later this year with her family and she has informed me that most of the scenery was fantastic and most of the travel information semi informative but there was too much emphasis put on where to get the best wines and eateries. There are better examples on the market for first time travellers.
5,"Samantha does England, Ireland, Scotland","(and boy are her legs tired?)If you like Samantha, you will love her travel videos of England, Ireland, and Scotland."
5,Orchestral Bach,"Leopold Stokowski was an organist before he was a conductor and Bach was his favorite composer. Therefore, it is not surprising that over his career as a conductor Stokowski chose to transcribe many of Bach's compositions for orchestra. Initially, some critics felt that Stokowski was desecrating Bach's music. But, over the years, Stokowski's outstanding Bach transcriptions have gained considerable respect and several other conductors now perform them. But no one performs these transcriptions as well as Stokowski himself, as the recordings on this CD brilliantly illustrate."
5,Great product,"First let me say great review J.governali. For the fools sitting in your rooms thinking these are going to block out your mom yelling at you...try reading the manual. If you haven't tried the noise canceling on a airplane or another noisy low freq form of transportation, do not write a review."
2,Its not a Noise Canceling Headphones,If you prefer a mice& a headphone 2 in 1 and a Noise Cancelling Headphones.. BE sure there is no Noise Cancelling Headphones. Just search for something more beneficial for you or cheaper.
1,Piece of junk!,"These work as advertised. BUT, only worked for 6 months and then never worked again. They are in the trash. Don't waste your money."
4,Good value for money,"After seeing high end noise canceling headphones for >$100, this one turned out to be a great buy in the $40 range. May not be as good as the high end ones but at the price it's a great buy."
4,Good,"A little tight on your head. That's cause this one doesn't have ""suction pads"" (don't have better for it). But they work great."
3,OK,"The headphones are OK in substantially reducing the noise in a cabin, but I expected much more. This is probably not so much the fault of this particular headphones, but rather the problem in canceling plane engine noise in general."
4,Great Value,"I've owned a $100 pair of noise cancelling headphones, but after my son broke them, I realized that another $100 investment might not be that wise. At the price I paid for these Sony headphones.. they're well worth their value. They work fine, but not as good as the pair I had. I guess you get what you pay for.. But with these... I believe you are getting much more. i have recommended them to a few friends and have lent them out many times.. So far, all positive feedbacks from friendsDoug"
2,Not Pleased,"I was very disappointed with these headphones. The ear pads are rigid and very uncomfortable after a short period of time. The ear pads do not surround the ear so they do not ""cancel out"" noise in the room well at all. The sound was good but they didn't do what I needed them to do which was cancel out the noise in the room. I returned these."
4,noise cancelling earphones,This product cancels noise great and allows both my boyfriend and I to enjoy two different listening situations without interfering with each other. They are heartier than others I have purchased in the past.
2,"Great sounds, great price but Horribly uncomfortable to the ears.","Great sound, great price but Horribly uncomfortable to the ears. My ears hurt everytime I wear them for any period of time. I guess no wonder they were inexpensive because the ear pads are made out of foam and one's ears can feel the hard surface of the headphones."
3,OK for the $$,"I tried these from BestBuy after seeing someone on a flight, and on sale. Unfortunately, IMHO, they were only OK -- uncomfortable on the ears, didn't cancel much ambient noise, and in noise-cancelling mode just created an annoying white noise. I exchanged them for the Bose $139 'Around the Ear' headphones -- aaaaaah MUCH better -- and hope they stand the test of time."
1,Poor quality of the plastic frame,"In my 2nd month of its use, the battery compartment from the frame broke loose and a week later the wire connecting the batteries to the headset gave way. so, the noise canceling stopped working since it needs batteries.A few days later , the plastic strap holding the right ear piece to the frame broke and now i can't even use it as a headphone let alone using it as a noise canceling one.I am surprised Sony employs such poor quality workmanship."
2,Lasted three months before breaking,"I got a pair of these relatively cheaply from an outlet store, but after only three months of occasional use, one of the speakers inside is broken, and audio only plays on one side. The noise cancelling ability is also marginal at best. Fortunately I didn't pay all that much for these, but you would probably be better off looking elsewhere."
4,"Work great, noise cancelling effective for certain low frequencies","I generally use these headphones for listening to lectures while in the metro / bus. Although the noise cancelling does appear to cancel noise (esp. the lower frequency), the over all lecture room sound reduces as well (which is the only reason I gave 4 stars).I am pretty satisfied and happy with these headphones, I guess if you are listening to music you will have no complains. For the very few like me (listening to lectures) you wont be that disappointed.Considering the price.....got for it -- you wont repent."
4,Excellent Value - Typical Sony Quality,"Initially drawn to the ""noise-cancelling"" feature of these headphones, however, in the default N-C off mode, the sound fidelity is excellent. My son has put many many hours on his pair with a PC set-up and has been very impressed with the performance available at a reasonable cost."
2,"For the price,","-the headphones proved to be...ok. the pair sent to me have a constant hum/buzz on one side, when not in noise-canceling mode. they are a bit ""clumsy"" as they do not fold-up as well as others. -other than that, they worked fine on my 10+ hour flight.An ok price for just-barely ok headphones. but if it's quality and performance you're looking for (and not just a quick/ cheap buy), it's probably worth it to spend the extra $$ and keep looking."
3,Noise Canceling Is Useless Outdoors,"I bought these headphones from an Amazon vendor and am glad I did because I didn't have to pay Amazon's price - $25 higher at the time. However, if I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy them. I use my iPod while commuting on public transportation and thought these headphones would be a good replacement for another pair of Sony noise-canceling headphones I had been using for 3 years. However, when I'm outdoors and have the noise-canceling function turned on, any wind is magnified tremendously. The function is virtually useless outdoors. I've resorted to turning the feature off and turning up the volume. The only other complaint I have with this product is that they're not portable enough. I may be wrong, but I thought the product features indicated they were foldable - they're not. This makes carrying them around a little tougher than foldable headphones. Again, I'm glad I didn't pay full price for these things."
5,EXCELLENT....SIMPLY EXCELLENT,"This has to be the best pair of headphones I've ever purchased - either online or at a store. Before I came here to Amazon, I bought a pair of headphones to replace my old Radio Shack 35mm titaniam headphones (A great pair-no longer manufactured). I had to return the 'new' Radio Shack headphones, because they were just bad...real bad. I was looking at Bose (I have a WAVE radio -love it..) but at 300.00 I couldn't fork out that much money for headphones. This was a good alternative - I'm not really using the noise cancelling, I care less about that. I care most for the sound and reproduction - I'm listening to Radio Paradise on 'em right now, Love the sweet sounds of Nickel Creek with the 'power' on - That's why this was the best $40 and not $300 for Bose ---sorry Bose, still love you. Sony wins this argument. Can't wait to fly with them, nice pouch included to store the unit. Peace - JG"
4,Cheap but Effective.,"Well worth the price. Have been using them for 2 months without any problems. Maybe not as good as some more expensive models, but good enough for me. Can hardly hear the wife bitching at me while laying on the couch listening to my music."
3,Headphone covers are foams - not vinyl,"I wish description indicated type of headphone covers. Headphone covers are fragile foams. With $35 price tag, I was expecting more durable and easy to clean vinyl covers. Two weeks after purchase, Target offered same item at $29. I couldn't figure out how to request price match refund from Amazon. If Amazon indeed has this option, it must be well hidden somewhere."
3,Good for the price,"The MDR-NC6 doesn't quite compare to the Sony MDR-NC50, but this is a great deal considering the price. I use these for the train ride to work, which is 1 hour each way and the noise canceling works well with the train noises, but does not block out peoples voices very well. I had been using the standard ear buds that came with my mp3 player and in comparison there is, of course, a considerable difference. After wearing these for about an hour I do begin to feel the pressure of the headphones on my ears. Other than that, no complaints."
3,Decent,"I puchased these blindly based solely on the Sony reputation. The sound was fine. These are not the most comfortable and they have a cheap plastic feel. If I could do it again I would not purchase these. You get what you pay for, 35$ headphones."
3,White Noise Enhancing,"This is the first time I have purchased Noise Cancelling Headphones for the office. I am not impressed, but maybe this is the way they all work (unless you are willing to pay much more for some). I hardly use the feature because when I turn on the ""noise cancelling,"" the white noise that is added to the background makes the music I listen to sound very faint, so if I do decide to use the feature, I need to crank up the volume of the music to compensate anyway. To me, they are just a set of decent regular headphones."
4,Feels Cheap - But Does the Job,"I bought this product to use on airplanes and just love it. The headphones do feel cheap out of the box, but they are comfortable to wear and do an excellent job cancelling out background noise. The fact that they fold up and fit snugly in my briefcase is a bonus as well. I also have not experienced any background whirring, wining, or hissing that some complain of with other models - and for the price, I am very happy with my purchase. The Bose set definitely ""feels"" better and probably provides a richer sound - but if you are looking for a cheaper alternative that does an excellent job, I'd go with the Sony."
3,Guy's Opinon,"Pros: Cool design, light weight, Sony Brand.Cons: Tight fitting, slight hissing background noise.For the price you cannot go wrong. However, if you are looking for true ambient noise cancellation with absolutely pure silence, buy the bose."
4,Met expectations,"I would call these ""noise reduction"" as opposed to ""noise cancelling"". These headphones cancelled most of the engine noise on my flights. I didn't even have to crank the volume on my laptop and cd player. Only complaint is that these headphone felt a little tight, unless my head is too big."
3,Noise Cancelling? Not so much.,"I have owned them for about a month. I purchased them for a long jet flight. The noise cancelling was MINIMAL in a jet cabin enviroment. I was just as well off using my ear-buds. I also tried them while operating a 2-cycle snow blower, no good for that either. They do work VERY well on low level, low frequency noises. i.e. in the car, in front of an A/C or fan, computers etc.... And the ""open"" design does permit hearing voices quite clearly.The sound is fine, no problem there. I found them to be quite comfortable."
2,They hiss and are tight.,"I really like the sound quality of these earphones, however, when noise canceling is on, there is an audible hiss. The hiss is almost more annoying than the noise. I haven't used these on an airplane, just in an office with a refrigerator, fluorescent lights and a lot of computers. Also, these start to hurt my ears after about half an hour because they are tight."
3,"Great sound, but uncomfortable","The sound on these headphones is great, but they are incredibly uncomfortable after about an hour. They hurt the tops of my ears, and my ears are totally red. Also, the cord is quite short for me; my desk set up is about 6' across, and I can't grab things at one end of the desk area without unplugging first."
1,Extremely Disappointing (over 13 but did not want to give my name),"I just bought the sony ""noise-canceling"" headphones at the local apple store after reading some good reviews. However, I found the noise-canceling feature to be extremely disappointing. When the feature was turned on, the only difference was an audible hissing noise. There was some reduction in ambient sound, but no more than with the feature turned off to begin with. However, the headphones themselves are fairly comfortable and have a fair sound, aside from the poor noise-canceling feature. I am extremely disappointed and plan to return the headphones for another pair of a different brand. I do not recommed buying these headphones unless you have the option of testing them and returning them after opening the package."
5,They really do cancel the noise!,I bought these headphones for my husband to use with his MP3 player. He works in a loud warehouse and he says the noise cancelling really does work! Great item for the price. I don't mind paying more for a quality product!
2,Sony vs Bose QC2,"I bought these and used them for a year, then received the Bose QC2 as a present. They Bose (around the ear) are much more comfortable and seem to do a much better job of cancelling the noise. The Sony are hard on the top of the head and their ambient white noise seems noticeably higher and distracting than the Bose.I know there's a 10-1 price difference, but I ended up not using the Sony pair much, even before I got the Bose, because they are just not that comfortable."
2,Disappointed.,"I originally bought these at a local Wal-Mart to take on a trip to Jamaica...well after the trip I decided to return them. Why?The noise cancelling didn't work up to expectations. I've tried other noise cancelling systems that worked as well or better than these, for a lesser price (price was around $60 when I first tried them). Someone mentioned a ""hissing""...I noticed the same thing. After a minute your ears will adjust to it, but if you're sensitive, it can give you a headache.The bass response was also a lot weaker than I had hoped for.Bottom line: If you want sound quality, look somewhere else."
3,These make me a little dizzy - Anyone else?,I got these for Christmas and I was pretty excited. But for some strange reason they seem to make me dizzy and nauseous when I have the noise canceling on. When I have the feature turned off they sound pretty good.
3,Good deal for the price,"I bought these because I started traveling a lot more on airplanes and when in Houston's airport I tried on some Bose Noise Cancelling headphones which really impressed me, but at $300 I figured I'd look into some others. I saws these on Amazon and read the reviews which were mainly positive. These work well for my purposes which is to mainly listen to narration rather than music, so as far as sound quality goes their not Bose, but I got these after rebate for $40. One thing you should be aware of, the picture leaves you guessing to if the ear pieces enclose around your ears. I thought they did, but they are the kind that sit on your ear. I thought they may be uncomfortable after long flight, but they were not as bad as I thought. They do a nice job of reducing the jet noise. Like the title says they are a good deal for the price"
3,Sony MDR-NC6,"I'm not sure what the ""power"" button actually does but the headphones actually sound better with it off. They are fine although the noise cancelling feature seems a bit lame."
2,Mowing the Lawn,"I wanted to listen to my iPod while mowing the lawn. I was hoping that the noise cancellation would work well cancelling the lawnmower noise. It helps. That is, it is better than the iPod earphones, but barely. The Sony phone don't fit tight, don't completely cover the ears, and have a tendency to slip while I'm sweating."
1,"If you like uncomfortable headphones, these are for you.","The battery pack on the headband poked me in the side of the head. After realizing this, I didn't care to check the sound quality."
2,Cheap for a reason,"Decent sound but the noise-canceling mechanism is poor. Powered by a AAA battery, it just ""hums"" out background noise and in the process decreases sound quatlity. Uncomfortable as well. I would either pay extra money for headphones that actually cancel out noise, or pay the same amount for headphones that are comfortable and have good sound quality."
2,Noise Canceling headphones,"I'm sorry to say that I am disappointed in this product. I had read reviews favorably comparing it to the Bose noise canceling headphones andI believed this to be a less expensive alternative. Perhaps I misunderstood, but I expected that all outside noise would be'canceled' and it certainly is not; noise doesn't even seem to be greatly reduced. I don't believe a product should label itself ""Noise Canceling"" unless it truely does what it says. Now I feel I must at least try the Bose in order to judge for myself. I'm sorry I did not return this product."
1,This is a fair warning: do not buy this set!,"Instead of canceling noise these headphones add a hissing white noise. It's even hard to say if the cancellation works at all. Something changes with the sound when you flick the switch, but the level of outside noise seems to remain the same. The battery box ""strategically"" placed on the inside of the headband will continually remind your sore skull that it is there.Whoever worked for Sony on designing this set should be made immediately available for employment."
2,Spend you $$ elsewhere,"I'm not sure how these headphones are pulling off an average rating of 4 stars.... Here are the very first things I checked for:1. Comfort - These have got to be the most painful set of headphones I've ever owned. If you wear glasses, be prepared to feel throbbing pain after about 30 minutes. Even without glasses, these phones lack a soft earcup, so be prepared to bleed a little.2. Bass - Where's the bass? Even after adjusting and tweaking equalizer settings, I could not get any bass out of this headset.3. Noise reduction? I found no difference at all, other than hearing a slight hiss when turning on the noise cancelling feature.I will be purchasing a new set of phones, and won't be afraid to spend a few more dollars -Overall? - dissappointed -"
2,Ouch!,"I'm not one to complain but... These headphones hurt my head the minute I put them on. The sound is fine, the price is fine, but just not comfortable at all."
3,"Not the best, but ok for the price.","I bought these headphones to use with my ipod while on a long flight. They feel comfortable on and they sound great. My only complaint: The noise canceling features don't really work. There was a small reduction in outside noise while on the plane, but nothing significant. It's better used as regular headphones."
5,Crisp and Detailed for Small Price,"I've been obsessively researching headphones for the last 6 months and have read that ear-canal earplugs can quickly ruin your ears and that music experts frown on the ""closed"" and noise canceling features as they compromise the brightness of sound. I concluded that I would stay away from those phones and thought I would have to spend at a minimum 100 dollars for the Sony MDR 7506 headphones, but then a student came to my class with the MDR-NC6, I asked if I could try them and he played his iPod. I was amazed. Far greater sound than other headphones I own (in the 50-dollar range). For me these headphones delivered the ""wow factor,"" the feeling the music is really taking me for a magic carpet ride. My quest for a 100-dollar or more phone has ended as I am more than happy with the 35-dollar (on Amazon) MDR-NC6."
3,Pretty good for the price......,"The sound quality and noise reduction was actually better then I expected.... but these are not very comfortable. First, the battery goes in the headband, which is bulky and just plain weird. But.... To be fair, I rarely find headphones very comfortable for two reasons I am sure will be familiar to others.... 1) I wear glasses... and 2) I am a woman who always wears earrings. Both of these are a bit of an obstacle with these headphones. The ear pieces are large, flat, and press tightly against your ears. After a couple hours watching a movie on a plane my ears hurt! I was also constantly adjusting my glasses and earrings trying to find a way to make the situation more comfortable but since the ear pieces are kind of large there was no way to keep them from pressing my glasses or the posts on my earrings into my head...lol. Aside from that, they sound great! I gave them to my boyfriend (who does not wear glasses or earrings) and he really likes them."
1,A total disappointment,These headphones cancelled about 10% of the noise in the room. They were not at all as I expected.
1,Headphones,"Don't buy this product. It doesn't reduce noise in an airplane, they're heavy and uncomfortable on long flights. Buy the padded 'over the ear' type of headphones; they're much uieter, far more comfortable and just plain better."
3,(NO)ise Reduction,"If you are looking for Noise Reduction headphones, this are not definitively what you need (against a the Bose). If you are looking for good sound, good hardware, this is a must"
4,Good headphones,"I travel quite a bit and always take these with me. They can get uncomfortable after a couple hours, but they do function nicely. My only complaint is that there is no volume control on these headphones and all your volume control has to be done on the device."
5,EXCELLENT! Well worth the money!!,"I recently purchased these headphones and have used them quite often. I even use them just in my apartment! I took them on a recent trip to NYC and used them in the airport to drain out the low frequency noise in the airports and on the planes. It is just amazing how they work! I have always been a huge fan of Sony and this product just goes to show that Sony is the best out there!!The only thing I didn't like was that after a few hours of having them on they kind of hurt my ears. They just press a little to hard against your head. But that is a minor detail for the excellent product!!!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend these headphones to anyone!!"
1,Displeased with performance so I returned it.,"I bought these headphones for use on commercial planes. I was very disappointed with the performance. I found that the combination of the plane's noise, combined with the 'white noise' from the headphones was terrible. I had hoped to ""cancel' some of the noise, but felt that it was worse. Other people may experience a different result, but I returned these headphones since I was disappointed and knew I'd never use them again."
3,No Volume Control,These would be great EXCEPT one cannot adjust the volume on the headphones. Volume must be adjusted from the source which is inconvenient.
5,Great Sony Headphones,"I love my headphones. I use them with my IPOD nano and they really deliver the kind of sound that I want to experience. I feel they are comfortable and do use them around the house and when walking a little bit. We own 2 sets of these headphones. One for me and one set for my husband as we both have our own IPODs. Bought them on Amazon as reburbished at an excellent price. The headphones looked just like brand new and would buy refurbished again. Very happy with product, price and service."
1,Cheap Sony headphones,"I'm from the generation that remembered Sony as a quality product. No more. Like several other Sony products I've purchased recently, they disappoint. Right away, the headphone jack began to fail and rendered the product useless."
2,Cheaply made and breaks easily.,"Works well to cancel noise. Probably the best on the market for the price. I bought a refurbished headphone with no problems. The plug, wire are under designed and will not take a lot of abuse. The head bar is plastic, and feels like it could break. I broke my pair at where the plug goes into the Mp3 player. Knowing now that it is a very breakable product, I would not take it to the gym, or work outdoors in the yard with it.I switched to a cheaper, but stronger headphone to wear to the gym, and to do my gardening work. Even if I break a cheaper headphone, I am not out of much of a dollar loss."
3,Worked well but not very durable,"I had a pair of these for about 2 years before they broke. Used them on long airline trips, mostly, & I travel by air maybe 3-4 times a year on average, so I didn't put a lot of hours on them. While they lasted, I was satisfied with their performance. They blocked low frequencies very effectively, higher frequencies not so much. That was OK with me; it helps a lot on a plane. A few days ago I discovered that the right audio channel had gone out. (Note to self: in the future, check that electronic equipment is working before packing it.)"
3,Best use is on an airline flight. Ok overall for the money.,"I've used these for about 3 weeks now.Riding on the subway, they reduce some of the noise, but not any of the louder screeches or door chimes.In general, I don't like using the noise cancellation all the time, and even with noise cancellation, these only boost the volume so far. Sometimes an ear bud closer in your ear, will give a better volume level.However, on a recent JetBlue flight I noticed that these performed excellent overall.They eliminated the annoying ""air flow"" sound nicely, some of the jet noise, and have wonderful volume boost, compared to the freebie Jet Blue head phones.Construction is a little flimsy, but I don't ""anticipate"" that with normal use that these should stop performing in any way. If they do, they will be promptly returned.Over all, for the money these are decent, for specific use. Not really worth it to lug these around all day everyday."
2,There's a reason Bose Noise Cancelling are so much more expensive,"Disappointing headphones. I still use Bose Quiet Comfort headphones. Former girlfriend lost my newest generation Bose, so I bought the Sony as I like not having a separate piece for the batteries.Used part of one commercial flight. Headphones do reduce some of the aircraft noise, but are fairly uncomfortable. The ear piece is hard. The sound from my audio device was harsh.I do not recommend the headphones."
3,OK - but failed in less than 6 months,"The sound quality is fine - you get what you pay for. It's not fantastic but it's not horrible either. All in all I had no complaints until they stopped working all together. Oh well, again you get what you pay for."
1,Very disappointed with these--an instant headache!,"I fly a lot and, in general, try to reduce the volume of playback to protect my ears, so I bought a pair of Sony MDR-NC6 headphones for travelling/using in a semi-noisy home. The second I put these on, I started feeling like I was travelling at high-altitude. My ears started popping, there was a horrible whooshing sound, and I felt pressure in my ears. It was horrible! Worst of all, the sound quality was mediocre and I didn't experience any noise cancelling--only a loud whooshing sound that blocked out a little bit of low frequency sound.My advice: try these out before you buy them. They were highly recommended to me, so the results may depend on the individual."
4,Great Price,"These headphones work well but if you listen really closely you can hear a small hum. For the price and brand, I'll deal with it."
3,Not as good as I expected.,"The noise canceling does not do good. You still hear the sound from outside. I feel the same as regular headphones plus when you turn on the noise canceling button, you will hear some kind of noise from your headphones. If you are looking for the noise canceling headphones, it won't work. But it is fine as using a regular headphones."
3,Low Buzz...,"I purchased 2 of these units and both will reduce the ambient noise of my office, however the noise is replaced by a low buzz. I can still hear people talking very clearly and the music sounds good but with no music just using them to eliminate general computer/fan noise they basically change the pitch of the noise not cancel it."
3,Noise Cancelling not very effective,"I brought these to replace another pair of inexpensive (<$50.) headphones, in this case Earhugger EC-1420NC. The noise cancelling was not as good and the headphones not as comfortable to wear. The pressure on the ears becomes uncomfortable after about one to one and a half hours. Not good enough for a long flight. I returned after one use."
2,Noise Cancelling?,"I already own the Bose noise cancelling headphones, this Sony was meant for my laptop. Too bad the unit itself has a poor S/N ratio, I can hear background 'noise' coming from the unit itself!Some noise cancelling!"
2,What??? I can hear PLENTY of noise...,"Noise canceling my pooter.... Not...They do sound good, but for $30 less I could have gotten the same thing.."
2,not remotely as good as others out there,"I know many people who have noise-cancelling headphones, and these are not nearly as good of quality as there are out there. When the 'noise-cancelling' switch is on, it has great depth to the sound, however there is one MAJOR problem - it actually enhances noises such as radio signals, wind, and any kind of percussive sound around me (like banging or clicking). It is very annoying. I listen to most music WITHOUT the noise-cancelling on because the other noises are so distracting. The ONLY thing that is good is that noise-cancelling headphones tend to brake easily, and these are sturdy, however, I don't really use them, so I'd actually be happier if they broke so I'd have an excuse to buy new ones. Take my advice - buy more expensive ones...they're worth the mone.y"
1,i could hear EVERYTHING through these,"I don't think my standards are too high... I could hear my finger snapping and horns of cars 5 storeys down through the noise canceling feature. Also, if you are getting these to avoid white noise, don't do it! It feeds you white noise."
1,Not worth the bargain price,"I bought these because I wanted to get a relatively decent pair of headphones with noise cancellation for a reasonable price. What I got was a piece of crap for which I would'nt pay $5. It does not cancel any noise, and is very uncomfortable on the ears. I had to take it off out of discomfort just 3 minutes after putting them on, though I would have taken them off after 4 out of sheer disgust. The sound quality is pretty good, provided you don't turn the cancellation feature on and are forced to listen to it running. So if all you want to do is listen to music without sound cancellation in increments of a few minutes each, it's not a bad buy. Otherwise, don't buy this product."
3,Cannot use while walking,I've got my Noise Canceling Headphones to be able to listen music while walking through a noisy downtown. Unfortunately noise canceling feature cannot be used while walking due to air blowing into external mikes. It results in laud wind like sounds making it completely useless in this case.
3,sony headphones,"They are all right. Nothing spectacular. They aren't sleek. The noise cancelling feature doesn't work as well as in ear phones or phones that completely encase your ear. Also, after wearing them for a few hours, they hurt my ears."
5,"Surprisingly good headphones, noise-cancellation works!","First, to answer to critics' reviews I'd like to say that one shouldn't expect total quiet from the noise cancellation feature. The way how cancellation works -- by creating counter- noise sound for certain range of frequencies-- works great against street, plane type of noise.Though I'm not Sony's fan, I was pleased with sound quality and quieting I enjoyed in noisy flight. I can actually ""hear"" how noise-cancellation kicks-in when you turn switch on: noises fade, really amazing!I paid ~$[..] for these headphones. Only problem is somewhat stiff band, but this is an amazing replacement for your walkman/mp3 headphones. They flatten and fit well in my laptop pocket.Ran 4 hours on a new AAA cell and didn't need to replace battery it yet. Given the price --- 5-star!"
4,Great Headphones,"My brother has these headphones and i sometimes use them and they arew great. Although everybody says the hissing sound is annoying you can only hear it when you aren't listening to anything and have them on the noise cancelling feature,but when you listen to music with the feature you don't hear it at all. Overall i think that this is a great pair of headphones and are really cheap."
3,"Nice headphones, but not very durable.","Nice, comfortable fit. Audio was strong, crisp and clean. Noise cancelling function on airline flights was good, not great. After having them for just a few months, I got the cord momentarily tangled on a door handle and that was the end of them. They just stopped working. I have several other headphones that have sustained years of more punishing pulls and drops and they work without a problem."
2,Does the job - Kinda,It kinda does the job but don't have your expectations too high. There is that annoying hissing background noise there as well.
2,I wouldn't buy again,"The noise canceling feature works only so-so, I use them at work and it can be loud and they do not filter out everything. Nor are they the most comfortable, they rest heavily on your ears and just don't feel that great. I have gone back to using my old Koss headphones that go over your ears, they are falling apart but my ears don't hurt."
2,Not impressed,"Definitely nothing to write home about. No volume control. No noise cancelling adjustment (besides on/off). The noise-cancelling isn't very effective compared to other headsets I've tried -- including no-name brands. The headband isn't cushioned; just hard plastic straight on your skull, the weight of the whole headset is borne by just one spot on the top of your head. Not comfortable. The friction with your ears isn't enough to hold it in place."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I bought these headphones because I work in a cubicle office environment and wanted to reduce the noise around me. The headphones do cancel out the sounds of the ventilation system, the heating system and the sound of the rain hitting the windows. They do not cancel out the people around me. I can still clearly hear people talking, phones ringing, and people typing around me. It seems like these headphones only reduce the ambient noises.The headphones when turned on seem to introduce a static sound, that while listening to music is ok, but when listening to audio books or podcasts is somewhat distracting.I might have been expecting more out of the headphones then what they were designed for. I am going to return them when I go back to the store."
4,Good product for the price I paid,I bought Noise Canceling Headphone to use at my work to avoid distractions. I am overall satisfied with my purchase.Sometimes I found this headphone is little heavy because this requires a battery. Voice quality is pretty good.
3,"The Headphones work well, but.....","I bought these headphones to block out noise when I travel and they have worked very well. I used them recently on a 10 hour flight to Italy and was able to block out 85% of the noise including a screaming baby. They are suprisingly comfortable and I was able to wear them while I slept on the plane. My only complaint is that the battery is in an odd place and the battery housing is very flimsy. I have already broken off a piece of plastic. They are still usable, but I am afraid they will not last through a lot of battery changes."
4,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones,"For the price, this is a very good product. It reduces the external noise level considerably while permitting low volume listening from my mp3 player."
2,not happy,"I used these for about 2 days before they started to malfunction. The sound quality inferior and not sony's best product... if you want a pair of good noise cancelling headphones, pay a little more and go in for audio technicia or bose"
4,Great noise cancelling headphones,Excellent purchase I made. Very comfortable and worth every penny I spent on these - especially when I am taking long flights in coach class.
3,Sony MDR-NC6 Noise Canceling Headphones,"The first pair I had ended up not working after about a week of use. THe Next pair I recieved have worked fine, so far.... They don't completly block out the sounds of a planes engines, but the sound quality is stilkl pretty good."
4,Great for the price,"I sat next to a gentleman on the plane the other day with noise blocking BOSE headsets. He was surprised that my headsets blocked the same amount as his. Pretty cool. My only issue is that the headsets are a little uncomfortable after an all day wear. I must say I do prefer the cushioned ear cup style, but for the price & noise reduction, these are awesome."
3,OK Product,These have a constant hiss and do a marginal job of noise reduction. You get what you pay for.
2,Not impressed,"The headphones don't work too well cancelling engine noise in flight, and the sound quality is just OK. Overall, I'm a bit disappointed, maybe that's what I should expect considering the price."
1,Are they serious?,"These don't cancel anything. I bought them for a plane trip, and even if I could stand the pain of wearing them for very long (they press very hard against your ears), there is nothing noise-canceling about them. My 10 dollar earbuds block out more noise than these. Honestly, sometimes I think people will fall for anything-- I think Sony just put ""noise-canceling"" on the label so they could charge more. And with some folks, if you say it is so it must be so I guess.This is my first and only venture into the noise-canceling headphone arena, but my guess is that if you want headphones that actually do that you're going to have to go with something in the 200+ dollar range."
1,White noise used for noise reduction,"I am actually Steve's wife. I am a music teacher. I found the Sony MDR-NC6 to be worthless for reducing sound around you. I could still hear my son turning pages in a book across the room. I actually found the sound of a classical CD to be clearer without the noise ""canceling"". The only change I heard, with the noise canceling on, is white noise and the music ampliphied a little bit. They seem like a nice set of regular headphones though."
3,pretty good for the price,"These earphones perform about as expected. On a crowded airplane, you still hear a lot of people noise as well as the rumble of the plane. You can, however, hear the audio fairly well, although it required a little more volume than I like. As long as you aren't expecting really great sound, they're fine. They are a good option for the price, but don't expect Lexus sound on a Kia budget."
3,Ok but BOSE is much better,"If you are looking for this in air craft use, Bose is the best can cancels 100% of the noise, where as this does only about 40%. Guy next to me on the plane had a BOSE and it was a good compassion to so. Without anything playing through the headphone, Sony is useless where BOSE was simply amazing.But ok for the prize that you pay."
3,Think about sticking with earbuds,"I suppose whether you like these or not depends upon whether you want to be seemingly ""surrounded"" by music (turn the volume up to 30 - that'll do it), or you want comfort. I tried these on a flight from Minneapolis to San Francisco just last week. They didn't cancel out the 2 year old behind me, and after 15 minutes, my ears were hot and my head was flattened from the sides. After an hour, the ""pain"" took my mind off any emotional problems. In other words, sounds good but uncomfortable as wearing two scrubbies, rough side in."
1,Next to worthless,"Not only did this set of headphones not deliver muich noise canceling, but one of the earphones quit working. The replacement headset fared no better. Check out a Brookstone product that used to be $150, but now is between $60 to $70. They may not isolate you as well as either of the super-effective (and super costly) Bose, but they come very close and do a credible job for a lot less money."
2,Uncomfortable,"Not enough ear padding. I can only stand to wear them for about 30 minutes. It works really well in the advertised frequency range, but you'd be surprised how much noise there is below 40Hz and above 1500Hz in my office where I use these."
2,Don't buy them,There is a reason these are so discounted.The sound is really good but they are so uncomfortable.No cushioning and they are tight.Spend your money of another set.
5,these are great,"these headphones are great! i am just like you, i spent hours looking at this product and reviews. i promise this is the truth-these headphones(for the price) are as good as the bose. my dad has the bose so i know. I think if you weigh the the pros and cons with these and the bose these would win this is why-good about sony's-great sound quality (especially with the noise cancelling switch on)-cancels about 70 percent of noise-on and off switch for noise cancelling-only 40 dollarsbad about sony--doesnt cancel all sound though a lot-fits tight on your ears"
4,"Good value, but needs some more padding","The noise cancellation of these headphones works quite well. The construction is sturdy, and the value is good. My only complaint is that there is no padding where the top of the headband rests on the head. Oddly enough, there is a rather pointed strip of hard plastic that sticks out there. I taped some padding on that spot, and the problem was solved (in a kludgy, but effective way)."
4,"Excellent, For the Price.","These kill the low frequency back ground noise and they do that very well. They are not the most comfortable headphones, but not bad. The battery compartment is a minor pain to get into.All that said, for the price, a good buy."
2,Sony MDR-NC6 noise canceling headphones,"Unfortunately, the noise-canceling feature does not work very well and you can still hear background noise pretty well."
2,You get what you pay for...,"These sound OK, but they barely reduce any outside noise. I fly a lot and I bought these for on the plane, but after one flight I returned them. The noise-cancelling technology seems to be just an audible hiss and an elevation in the volume. Aircraft and ambient cabin noise is reduced only marginally; I still had to crank the volume to hear my music effectively. Even at home I put these on in front of my computer and I could still hear the hum from my CPU. If you want noise cancelling, spend the extra money and get the Bose."
2,Noise Canceling doesn't work. Comparison with Bose,"I received the Sony headphones for Christmas. The noise canceling just simply doesn't work. To make sure my expectations were reasonable, I asked to borrow a coworker's expensive Bose noise canceling headphones. They work really well and were what I was hoping for in the Sony headphones. I guess you get what you pay for. There is a reason they are half off.One note on the Bose though is that you always have to have them turned on (thus using battery power). The Sony ones you can use either way."
1,Do not buy this headphones they brake easily.,"We got several pairs of MDR-NC6 at the company I work for. 75% broke in less than a year. The side where the battery is located had the most problems.And yes, Sony's customer service doesn't care for these kinds of products, and they basically tell you that you need to buy another pair because they can't do anything about it, or you need to pay a lot for them to look at them.What a waste of money; we need to buy more headphones but it is going to be a different brand."
3,The noice canceling feature is mediocre,"There is really not too much to complain considering the price I spent on it. The headphone works fine, but it didn't meet my expectation on the noise canceling part. It does cancel maybe 40% of the low frequency noise. However it also creates a fairly loud static noise of its own, and it appears to amplify the high pitch noise a little bit. It's over the ear design also cuts down the effectiveness.If you are really serious about eliminating the noise and don't want to pay for a Bose, I'll say get a Panasonic RP-HC300. I got one myself after the Sony and it does much better job."
2,Ineffective,"There is a slight reduction in regular, low-frequency noise as in air travel, but these are not nearly as effective as Bose or Audio-Technica. Additionally, these are very picky about how they are positioned on your ears -- it has to be Just So to work."
4,Decent noise cancelling,"I bought these for the noise cancelling and I am very pleased with them for the price. It allows me to hear voices clearly and at normal volume but cancels out all the hums, buzzes, etc. that come from fans, flourescent lights, etc."
2,Not as good as they look,"I was very unhappy with these. They look great-very slim design; however, I wore them on the airplane and they barely hid the jet noise. Additionally the battery compartment is on the inside of the headband. It dug into my head. It actually gave me a headache. I would not buy these again or recommend them to anyone."
3,"Okay performance, okay comfort","I have used these on several international flights over the past few months. The noise cancellation is just ""okay""; you get some small reduction in the background engine noise, but not as much as I got from my last pair of inexpensive NC headphones (sorry I don't remember the brand; they were a gift) that I used until they snapped in half along the folding hinge. The Sony didn't have the annoying hiss that the other pair had, which is a plus. It was somewhat more comfortable as well. It didn't squeeze my skull like the other pair did, but after a few hours, my ears still hurt, which may be due to them pressing against my eyeglasses. Overall I would say these are okay, better than nothing, but could definitely be better, especially in the noise cancellation feature."
5,Sony MDR-Nc6 Noise Canceling Headphones,"This is a great set of headphones. I was having trouble with my old pair, because I could hear the keys clicking while I was trying to hear what to transcribe. This made it very difficult to work. I have had no problems with this headset, however. I haven't even had to use the noise canceling feature much. But when I do turn it on, it really blocks out the noise around me. I love them!"
3,It is average HeadPhone,I am not really impressed with this headphone. I expected better sound quality from sony. Suprisingly Sony's $20 headphone(dont remember the model) has got better sound quality.
4,A great value in noise canceling headphones,As a frequent traveler I had want a set of noise canceling headphones but was far too cheap to spring for the $300-400 ones. I bought these on a whim for my wife and I and we used them on a non-stop from Atlanta to Hawaii. They were great particularly on the red-eye back! I highly recommend them as a great value.
1,Sony MDR-NC6 Noise Canceling Headphones,"Do not buy these phones for noise cancelling - they are ineffective, both in the passive mode (just phones on your ears) and with the noise cancellation turned on. They are supposed to cancel low frequencies only, which means that all noise of conversations, PA announcements and so on come through as if you had no phones on. In the low frequencies, such as airplane engine noise, they are ineffective as well.I have no opinion on their performance as headphones per se, since I bought them for airplane travel noise cancellation.I was forced by the review form to give this product one star, but in my opinion it is worth zero stars.They also take up quite a bit of room, which these days of restricted carry-on on airplanes, is another disadvantage."
1,"Very little noise canceling, terrible fit",I just received the Sony MDR-NC6 Noise-Canceling Headphones today. After installing a new battery I tried them out. I bought them mainly to listen to mp mp3 player while mowing. They do not reduce the mower noise a noticeable amount and they do not fit comfortable at all. If I can return them I will.
3,Good price,"Good sound for the price, but uncomfortable after about an hour of wear, had to take them off frequently during my trip."
1,bad service,The headphones stop working within 30 days. It took long time to get a response for replacedment of defective from the vendor.
2,"Problems with the jack, and with non-mechanical sounds","Every time I walk outside with my headphones, I get stopped by someone who has the exact same model. They always want to know what I think of them, and invariably they always discuss their disappointment with the model. They have the same criticisms I do:(1) There is a problem with the headphone jack. The wires seem to short out very easily. Several other people I've spoken with have had the same problem.(2) The noise-cancelling feature works great on man-made noises such as train and bus engines, but it actually makes some noises WORSE. When the wind blows, for example, the sound is multiplied by the microphones, and the music becomes completely inaudible. They're also useless for sounds such as snoring.As far as headphones go, they're ok, not fabulous. I'd expected much higher quality from Sony, especially for this price."
2,broken in a month,don't buy this product not worth the money your paying try the other sony products like mdr v300 it's really durable...
1,Waste of money!,"First, let me say that these headphones are terrible in sound quality. That being said, it gets worse. I am on my third set after returning two to Wally-world because of defects at the time of manufacturing. One set was DOA the minute I opened the box and the other worked fine for about 3 weeks. Luckily, I saved my receipt and now I am stuck with a non-working set. The headphones do work when they are not defective, but the noise cancellation is not even close to a Bose headphone. I guess you get what you pay for.I can't recommend these to anyone. They are cheap, have very short lifespan, don't really work that well and are cheap... oh, I did mention they are cheaply made didn't I?Save your money and get something that may cost a bit more but offer more to you. Expect these Sony's to fail at some time."
1,lomg term review,"great product.. BUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!I own a BMW 325, so I will compare to both.After 3 years of use , sea-air / salt water, deteriorates the quality.SO.GOOOD but degardes over time..Big MACBeen to FIJI, L.A. , MIA, HOU, ATL. NYC, NWK, etc, so they have about 30k miles on them, up and down, but you know they turn you off before u take off...I need some new gold pated head phones, nice single wire,..."
2,Cancel these Headphones...,"These are awful, period. There is barely noise reduction let alone cancel.These are an uncharacteristically bad product for Sony. I was very surprised, as they were not cheap (way cheaper than Bose, but now I see why)."
3,noise reduction headphones,The noise reduction is only at the lowest frequencies and provides little suppresion of speech or music fromother sources
3,right for the price,"for cheap noise cancelling headphones, they're great. but i'm a commuter and bought them having read ""fold for easy storage"". it's a lie. they don't fold at all.they're no boss noise cancelation, but definitely make a difference (even if you can only tell when you take them off).the battery has a really long life, but the switch is also in a place where it can easily get turned on/off in a bag."
5,Noise cancelling,This product was purchased for our son who is in a treatment facility. Our main focuses were noise control as well as comfort. This product took care of our concerns 100%!
2,Most certainly NOT noise canceling!,I am a frequent flyer and rely on headphones for a peaceaful flight. These were certainly NOT the ones for that purpose! I've actually started using my old ones again. I've given these to my son for his DVD player in the car.
1,don't work,"Maybe I got a defective pair, but the noise cancel barely does anything, maybe cuts out 3%. Not worth it, taking back and trying something else."
2,Would not recommend.,"These are ok headphones, however I would recommend headphones without noise canceling. You pay more for the noise canceling feature and in reality its not very good. Just sounds like static to me. Overall I think the quality of these headphones is less than satisfactory."
5,Great value for the money,"I tried several noise canceling headphones (including other SONY models) before settling on these. The noise cancellation is one of the best I've experienced. They also have good electrical sensitivity which means you will get pretty good sound volume from most MP3 player outputs (this was not the case with several other models I tried). I only wish the headphone design enclosed your ear completely for better sound isolation but, for this money, I think I'm asking too much.... You can't go wrong on these."
1,Hiss and throbbing noises,"I cannot recommend these headphones.I do quality assurance for a living and pay attention to details. I gave this model of headphones (Sony MDRNC6) a try about a year ago and found the following, using a brand new battery (actually I tried several batteries):Headphones off: I hear background noise (to be expected) and music sounds good when played.Headphones on: Background noise lessens (good), but at the same time a high-frequency hiss and a low-frequency throbbing are introduced (not good). These hiss/throb sounds were not part of the background noise and I heard these even when using the headphones in a quiet location, when the headphones were plugged into a MP3 device and when they were not, when music played and when it was not playing. When the music played, turning the headphones on added a hiss and throbbing to the music.I found the hiss annoying and the throbbing disturbing. I cannot recommend these headphones based on these findings."
2,"Work great, but a pain on the ears","I bought these specifically for business traveling, but find that I can only tolerate these earphones for an hour on the plane. They work very well in noise-cancelling, but then they start to hurt my ears after only an hour! Plus, they aren't as compact as I had hoped. The ear pieces swivel inward, but the band doesn't fold at all. That means they're still a bulky item to bring with you. If I had known these things from the start, I wouldn't have gotten them. My next earphones will have those cushioned cups that enclose the ears- those look so much more comfortable."
2,Ok but could be better,"I like the fact that these headphones don't have background noise when the noise cancelling feature is off (unlike some others I tried). I don't think these headphones do a good job at reducing noise much less cancelling it out but the sound quality is pretty good for the price. I think they fit my head pretty well and the headphones have a nice long cord (5'9"" I believe). The earpieces rotate so that the headphones can flatten but they don't truly fold up to a smaller size. The batteries also don't last as long as some of the competitors (~30 h life span instead of 50 h). I just wish they did a better job reducing background noise."
1,Not very good!,The battery compartment is placed on the side by your head. This is not confortable at all! I'd look into another brand or other Sony model.
3,Don't expect too much,"I had too much expectation on this item, so I was disappointed, especially the noise cancelling feature. I don't think it cancels 70% of the noise, but it's hard to quantify this sort of things. And once the music starts playing, I just don't see the noise cancelling feature being effective since the music does the work for it.To be fair, this is my first headphones after 8 years, so I have nothing recent on which I can make a fair comparison."
3,Spend the extra dough & get the boise,Spend the extra money and get the Boise you'll be happier in the end.These are o.k. but if you've waited this long for headphone SPEND THE EXTRA DOUGH.
2,Good when it was...,Title says it all. This headphone was good for three months before it died on me. The left speaker quit working without any apparent reason. Now I need to figure out how the warranty works for this....Update: Sony Customer Service sent me a replacement MDR-NC50 very fast. No problems or hassles at all. I can give it 4 stars now because of Sony service.
3,"good, but no bose","Bought the headset for a long international trip with my wife. We also own the bose headset. This is a good headset, but not close to the bose."
2,Pathetic / Bad.,"The 3.5mm jack is too long or shaped wrong. I have difficulty hearing the highs and lows at the same time without very carefully adjusting the input-jack. Thankfully I use these at my desk. However, the sound quality is miserable as well. I have a set of mini earbuds (I think they may be skullcandy brand) and they blow these away in clarity."
2,Dont buy sound is horrible,these headphones are a joke. The sound sucks and the noise cancellation is laughable. Better off just shelling out more dough for something better
1,Terrible,The noise canceling feature doesn't work at all - except to actually make the outside noise WORSE. I strongly recommend against these headphones.
1,Does very little to cancel noise,Practically worthless as a noise canceling device. The headphones may work fine.
4,Noise Cancelling Headphones,I am pleased with my Sony headphones. They cancel out a lot of the mower noise that I was trying to get rid of. I wanted to use them while mowing and weedeating the yard. They don't cancel all the noise but enough to hear the music. I am pleased with my purchase!
4,Good Value,"Sound quality is very good- almost as good as my MDR V6 (studio monitor) phones. I was pleasantly surprised. The noise cancellation does a good job at the low end, as it is designed to do- it does not cancel out everything - just low end. It completely removed the sound of my treadmill's motor, as well as the sound the house ventillation system makes. Very satisfactory for my purpose. Could be more comfortable, and the pads could be a little more substantial. I expect to have to replace the pads frequently, but I haven't had them long enough to say for sure. Bottom line - I would buy them again, but I got a good price on them ($39.99). Would I pay list? Maybe..."
1,Disappointed,"I'm convinced you need to have the headphones totally cover your ears in order for the noise cancelling to be effective.These headphones allow too much outside noise (I'm talking subway) to reach your ears even with the noise cancelling on.Yeah I hear a difference,these headphones introduce a hissing sound when turned on and boosts the volume to drown out outside noise.Google some professional reviews on this and you'll see they shoot it down.Save your money.I'm giving these to my nephew."
3,"Good sound, but painful to wear","I, like most people that reviewed these headphones found them to be painful to wear. I gave them two days of use. I was hoping they would get better. But every 30 min. I had to give my ears a rest because of the pain. It's a shame too. For $33.00 the sound was pretty good and the noise masking was pretty effective.I'll be returning these and looking for something else."
5,Great buy!,"I tested this item at Sony store before purchasing it online. I am extremely happy and satisfied with this headphones. I use it alot when I'm at work (to avoid noise and hear personal conversation) and also when I am on public transportation. The sounds and especially the bass, which I like, are great. I cannot wait to use this when I'm on vacation (airplane). The only con: since it is new, my ears get sore (squished) after awhile but I think it will be ok if I continue to use it. I highly recommend this to everyone."
2,"ok, but not great","I bought these for the office b/c I work in a cube. The sound is good, but they are not comfortable (the padding is very thin and cheap) and they do not block out as much noise as I had hoped. I also bought a pair of the Audio Technica over the ear headphones and those are far superior to the Sony headphones. Yes, they are more expensive, but well worth it."
2,Work well...until they break,"I used these on three air trips until on the 4th one they suddenly started delivering low-volume, distorted sound. This happens both with the noise cancelling on and off, and with any type of source (iPod, computer, etc.) Basically they are now unusable. True, I didn't pay Bose prices but I'd still expect any set of headphones to last more than 4 uses. I believe this is more evidence that Sony quality has dipped significantly compared to years past. I would recommend saving your money and buying a higher quality product--at least one that will last more than a few months."
1,terrible all around,"I found these headphones uncomfortable to wear, they add noise instead of canceling it, and after very minimal usage, the right headphone just stopped working. I thought I would try spending a little more than usual on headphones to get a good pair. My plan ended up backfiring and I am back using the $20 black sony headphones that I bought years ago.These headphones are, sadly, a complete disappointment."
3,Sony MDR-NC6 Noise Canceling Headphones,This device does not eliminate as much sound as I thought. I found I had be in relatively quiet room to get the maximum usage.
3,Adequate but bulky,"They'd be a lot more user friendly if they were a folding design. In my normal working environment they do a good job of taking out most of the noise of cooling fans, but they don't remove the higher frequency hiss of air and they either leave or add a low frequency thrumming. I tends towards them adding it because I've never been aware of it even when all the air cooling systems are off. Audio quality is OK, I wouldn't go further than that.I have yet to find a consumer offering, including the Bose headsets, that comes anywhere near to the combined active/passive effects of a good aircrew headset. Still searching for a good solution."
4,A good value for the price,This headphone is inexpensive for a noise-cancelling set. Fairly comfortable. Decent sound. Durable. I would recommend for the price.
3,If you like your skull crushed . . .,"One of the most frequent complaints about these headphones is that they hurt your head because they tend to crush or pinch the head. I didn't think I'd have a problem since I've got a fairly small head. Well, I was wrong. It's difficult wearing these headphones for more than 15 minutes without having to take them off to relieve the pain pressure off the ears. My ears also tend to get warm under the foam ear covers.There's another brand of headphones called ""Skull Crushers,"" but I think these are the real SKULL CRUSHERS. I was hoping that I'd get use to the skull crushing or that they would loosen up, but so far no luck.If you've got a super small head, this would be a good headphone. If you're an adult with an average size head, be forewarned that these are SKULL CRUSHERS.Except for the SKULL CRUSHING feature, these aren't bad headphones for the money. However if I had to do it over again, I'd probably spend the extra money for a Bose headphone."
2,I was disappointed,"I got these (not on Amazon) but I guess I was expecting it to do more than it did. I have trouble with noise distractions at work and they sort of deadened the noise but not enough in my opinion. The sound quality of music was good, but I think ""Noise Canceling"" is too strong a description for them. It's misleading."
2,"sound okay, break easily","Sound is OK, certainly good enough for a plane or bus ride. They get uncomfortable on me after a while. Problem I and other have is that they break easily. In my case, the speakers work, but the noise-cancelling function is disengaged unless I twist the right phone so that it is at a 90-degree angle to my ear. Not really easy to use like that! The wiring connection inside this right channel must be bad, as the reviews here and elsewhere cite many problems with the right speaker. I used to think of Sony as a quality company, but my experiences with their stuff over the lat 10 years has caused me to rate them just above Radio Shack, and that's not saying much."
2,"not very comfortable, hissy","these headphones play music well, but they are very tight on my head and i can only wear them for 20 minutes or so at a clip. the nise cancelling produces an extremely noisy hiss. they're pretty good on airplanes, not really anywhere less noisy."
4,Good headphones,Good sound quality; tend to get a little tight/heavy on your years after some time of use. Noise cancellation works only environments like trains and airplanes (places with constant background noise).
4,Almost perfect,"Noise cancelling works perfectly on airplanes and on my farm tractor. Unfortunately, the earpieces are only surface pads; if they had completely enclosed the ear this product would rate a 5.I bought them last year for about $75. At this $34 price they are an absolute bargain."
3,nice headphones,"Nice headphones for listening, comfortable, clear sound. Noise canceling is ok on the train, noise is decreased to background. Noise canceling is worthless outdoors, the wind howls. Overall, very good."
4,Good buy.,This is a a good little product. Packs a punch and has clear sound. It was definitely a good buy.
2,"Wretched product, way too much bass.","I had to fiddle with all of my sound settings just to make them semi-acceptable and I've never had to do that with any speakers or headphones I've owned, ever. Before I changed my equalizer settings they made me feel like I was sitting in between 2 lowriders."
3,Works great but uncomfortable at times,"I bought these in November 2006 and had a great time with them because they worked very well and I didn't have any problems with them. After 2 months I started noticing that when I would turn on the noise cancelling function there would be loud static in the left earphone which can really irritate the eardrum. This may have been because I didn't put them in their case and just carried them around with me in my bag but I don't know.Also, they get uncomfortable on the ears after an hour or so and after that very painful due to the low amount of padding in the earphones itself. This has caused me to only use them for a very short amount of time and without the noise cancelling function. If you want a great noise cancelling headphone just get Bose, you can't go wrong with them."
3,It reduces about 60-70% of the jet noise,"It reduces about 60-70% of the jet noise, with its price point I am satisfied with it and planning to use it every time I travel by plane. BTW, the audio quality is much better than my original headphone came with the MP3 player."
4,Good buy,"These are great...excellent product for the price. Very comfortable on my head, very sturdy, and they really do cancel most of the noise."
5,"GREAT LISTENING , GREAT HEAD PIECE","THE SOUND IS GREAT & THE HEAD PIECE IS PERFECT FIT. I WOULD BUY IT, OH I FORGOT, I DID ! I LOVE USING THIS. THE COMFORT IS WONDERFUL. IT WORKS !!"
3,These headphones do the job.,These heads phones are nice but they cut out once in a while and the noise canceling feature isn't the best but if you don't want to spend a lot of money these may be the way to go.
4,Sony MDR-NC6 Noise Canceling Headphones,"The headphones were purchase to cancel noises and they do just that, however they have not been used for any-thing else, but do expect them to be just wonderful for listening to music."
2,Not impressed at all,"They're heavy, no head padding, and noise-cancelling works but the white noise is too loud for my taste. Don't get me wrong, they're good for the price but I found it worth it to purchase a higher end pair. I purchased the Phillips shn9500 and I'm very happy. The Bose being a 10/10, the Phillips is an 8/10, with this Sony NC6 being a 5. I ended up returning this pair. Conclusion: good looking pair but falls short on execution."
4,Great Product for the price,"Great product for the price. I use this at home while the wife has the TV blarring, and on planes."
3,"Mediocre performance, does not meet the Bose standard","Already owning the Bose QC-2, I bought these, hoping they would not create the pressure on the ear the Bose ones do. The pressure (which gets to you after wearing the headphones for about 3 hours) was less, but the noise cancelling was not nearly as good as with the Bose.Unlike the Bose, where the battery is inserted into one of the earphones, the battery here is inserted into a cheap plastic holder on the frame. The holder on the set I bought broke quickly, turning the product into just another cheap Japanese passive headphone.I would not buy these again. What I would buy, and have recently bought, are thePanasonic RP-HC500 Noise-Canceling Headphones. Virtually identical to the Bose QC2s (at about 1/2 to 2/3 the price), they are better made and more comfortable. Highly recommended."
2,cheap foam ear pads,"While I know you get what you pay for, the list price belies the quality of the product. The foam uncomfortable as it is, ripped while stored in the carrying case after only 2 weeks."
4,Great Sony product from AMAZON,"I purchased this earphone because it was a great deal from AMAZON for only $25 and I had no idea of what is noise cancellation when I purchased this. I tried this earphone in my lab, which has big noise, such as air conditioning, an oil vacuum pump and a water vacuum pump, like that in an airplane, . This noice makes me a headace when I stay long. When I turned the cancellation on, it is very obvious that this noise was reduced. I think it will do its job on a plane too. Speaking of sound quailty, it is better than SENNHEISER MX500, which is at the same price range. All in all, it is dependent on how much you pay for it. For $25, it is a great gift for Christmas or personal use, but for $50, it doesn't worth it."
4,SONY MDR-NC6 Headphone,"The headphone working great the only disappointed is the cable is too short to move around the desktop, I end up to buy another extention for that."
4,Good for the money,"I didn't expect absolute silence, but when used on the airplane (w/o music) it reduced the engine roar significantly. With an iPod it's like a concert on top of your head... sounds awesome."
3,Good,"They work good, but I am sure that Bose are better. You can still hear noise, but it is muffled."
2,Frame breaks easily,"Great headphones, but the plastic silver part on the side of the headphone cracks easily. I'm on my second pair. I wish they would make the frame stronger."
3,Noise Canceling?,"Turning on the noise canceling just seems to make a very very faint hum when no music is playing. Otherwise they are a good quality phone, comfy, good fidelity, fold flat. I'm told the noise canceling is biased towards airplane noise, I'll try them this weekend while flying."
2,Sony Headphones,"While the noise canceling feature did work when I used the phones with a portable DVD player on the aircraft, the plug would not work in any of the four types of aircraft that I used on my latest trip. When inserted into the seat plug, all I could hear was a series of loud pops. When I purchased a pair of Sharper Image headphones, they worked perefectly on both the aircraft audio systems as well as my portable DVD player. In addition, the ear muffs completely covered the ear resulting in a more comfortable fit."
4,Satisfied Overall,"I have had these headphones for about a year. I think they are an excellent option for the budget conscious. I have been pleased with their performance on airplane rides. I have also tried to use them for mowing the lawn, but they aren't quite up to that. They are fairly comfortable, as long as you keep your head in an upright, straight-on position. You cannot lay your head to the side as that blocks the noise-cancelling function. Overall, I am fairly pleased with their performance for the money."
4,Sony MDR-NC6 Noise-Canceling Headphones,I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. She claims she can't hear me talking and she likes that.
3,good clarity but inconvenient,These give some good sound clarity but invenient to use for a long time. They slightly give some pain no matter how you adjust it.
2,"Not bad, not good","noise cancellation is not upto the mark. Atleast, not wat i expected from sony. I definetly wont recommend to any one if the main purpos of getting it is for noise cancellation. Other wise sound clarity is great."
3,Noise Canceling with Static,"I have had mine for several months, and although they do a decent job of canceling the ambient noise they also seem to introduce an annoying static both when the NC tech is on and when off. It is interesting to note that once the battery runs out, the static goes away too.I have yet to have to take them on a plane, but we will see how they work in that situation when I do."
4,Solid Headphones,"For the price (32 dollars) that amazon is offering these headphones for, id say these are a solid buy. the sound is clear, the design is nice and as far as comfort they arent stellar for long periods of time but theyre definitely not bad. The noise cancelling only blocks out very low frequency sounds, air plane noise being the prime example. These headphones are great for airplanes becuase they almost completely elimate the outside noise and come with an airplane adapter plug. So if youre looking for cheap, decent noise cancelling headphones id say these are a good buy."
3,"It's ok, not great!","I've never had a noise canceling headphone before so I did not know what to expect. That said, I thought it would cancel more of the noise than it actually did. What it did was cancel the whizing noise everyone hears when its realy quite. I look forward to using it on my next flight to see if it cancels out the annoying blabber mouths and the always expected airplane noise. The audio sound is very good and it comes with several plugin options. Also it has a little nifty pouch. It tends to be heavy on the ears a little bit especially if you're wearing glasses. Overall is a nice pair of headphones but don't rely to much on the noise canceling feature (which by the way is pretty asy to turn off with a button on the left headphone)."
4,serve the purpose,"soft, well adjustable around the top. wish they would a bit bigger to cover the ear completely. otherwise, great product."
3,"Good sound, but not durable.","These worked well, but I had some issues with their sturdiness. I had to return them (can't recall the issue now, it's been a while) & and they sent me a refurbished replacement. THey now have a crack in the right side & the foam is disintegrating. Not bad for the price."
3,decent performance for the price,"I got them as miles redemption and did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the performance. Once you turn on the noise-reducing circuitry, the low frequency range noise is significantly reduced. The NR works equally well for desktop PC fans as for airplane engine noises. They are also acceptable from the comfort p.o.v., I use them at the office, wearing them continuously for 2-3 hours at a time and they're OK.Of course, there are downsides. Beside the flimsy plastic construction, and cheap foam covering the speakers, the noise-canceling circuit injects a lot of hiss and the sound quality is mediocre.These are not HiFi headphones. They work however surprisingly well at reducing noise for how cheap they are (gratis in my case). Don't set the sound quality bar too high and you'll be happy you got them."
3,Mediocre product. Susceptible to wind.,"A mediocre product in general. Here is why:1)Only about 70% of the ambient noise gets neutralized (Sony is honest by specifying that);2)Susceptible to wind. Do not know if this is true for other noise cancelling products. With this product it is because the noise cancelling woks by detecting incoming/outside noise using built in microphones. This means when you are outdoors on even not a too windy day you will hear the wind noise (I assume that will always happen when riding say a bike) that will force you to turn off the noise cancelling function for the noise being too much to handle; and3)Relatively heavy (again, I think because of the build in microphones).I guess the earbuds will be a better choice and the sound quality should be better because they go deep inside the ear."
2,Review of Sony MDR-NC6 Noise Canceling Headphones,"I purchased these headphones for use on a recent trip to Europe. Noise canceling? I am no longer sure what that means for it didn't seem to make any difference whether I had the headphones turned on or off. However, these headphones are far better than those supplied by the airline"
3,"Nice headphones, not the best noise cancelling though","Now I do love Sony products, and when I saw these headphones that were noise-cancelling at a good price I had to try them out. The headphones work well, sound is good and clear and they are pretty comfortable. The noise cancellation is okay, I took them on a recent business trip and they did block out some noise but not nearly the quality of some other noise canceling headphones. For the price though, not too bad. I use them on a daily basis at work and they seem very durable and up to the usual Sony standards."
1,didn't even listen to the sound--horribly uncomfortable,"I read all the personal reviews and thought this was a good product, even stylish and comfortable as Sony could be. I also have a cheap pair of Sony headphones and they are be great. Well, now I am convinced that many of the ""personal reviews"" listed below are not real people. Sony, if you're reading this, how can you guys design such a terribly uncomfortable product. (Q: Did you even design it or just put your name on it?). I can't speak about the sound quality because this laughingstock made it immediately back to Amazon. I would buy other Sony products, just disappointed that this one made it thought the QA process. Buyer [absolutely] beware."
3,"no good for pro, ok for regular people","this headphone's noise cancellation feature seems working (for the price)... but the hissing noise that generates when power-on are annoying!! for people with low expectation, they may think it is ok with the hissing sound for the benefit of noise cancellation feature. I suggest to look for something better for yourself, and definitely not suitable as a gift! (may be good for your old parents... just kidding... am I?)"
1,Don't waste your money - These are horrible!,"Don't waste your money - These are horrible!Cheap constaruction, sound ok. Noise cancelling feature pathetic!"
1,broken in a month,I used these headphones very sparingly for only a month and the wire started to pull appart. I am generally very careful with electronics and it was never pulled on. Unfortunatly when they did work they didn't really cancel sound. Admitedly they have resonable sound quality at times.
1,Disappointed,These are not very good noice canceling headphones. What noise canceling does occur seems to be due more to the earpieces than the electronics. Spend more money. These aren't worth the price.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought a pair of these in mid July for $50. I thought they were pretty good, and was starting to like them. A couple of days ago, the noise canceling was turning on and off, before shutting off completely. I figured the battery had died, but when I bought new batteries today the noise cancelling function would not work, less than two months and they are now basically the $20 headphones that I should have bought in the first place, but they cost me $30 more. Don't buy these they're garbage."
4,For the price...they are the best,"I bought these to replace the original ipod ear phones that have started dying on me. I wanted something for a reasonable price that would help block out some noise as I take the bus and subway every day. These do the trick!!! I have been able to turn the volume of my ipod down by half and it sounds louder and better then with the old ipod ear phones. Also the noise cancelling does work, I hardly hear the subway anymore."
4,"Good sound quality, mediocre sound cancelling","Good- *excellent* sound quality with the noise cancelling off. Seriously, it was absolutely fantastic.Bad- Noise cancelling mediocre, and produced definite white noise.- Headphones uncomfortable for long periods if you have normal guy-sized ears (I'm 6""0). This is the biggest reason I returned them - the part that goes over your ears is just to small.I knew I had been missing something with headphones, and wow - these headphones really made my music sound good again with the sound cancellation off. I *really* wish the MD50 (Sony) had as good of sound quality as these. *sigh*"
1,Self-defeating Design,"Do not buy! I don't really understand what the designers were thinking. The sound/power cord runs through the swivel point on the ear cup. Over time(not long), the wires rub against the plastic hole which cuts through, stopping all functionality. I have lost respect for Sony as whole for producing such a poorly designed product."
5,Comfortable and excellent sound!,"This headphone has nothing to envy to Bose...the sound quality is amazing! you can even try it with the portable DVD players, and the sound quality will impress you, compared to how you can hear the DVD's with other prestigious headphones. I bouht this headphone around a year and a half ago, and they look like new. I highly reccommend this headphones. You will never be dissponted!"
3,"Not bad, but could be better","Overall I found this set to have a comfortable fit, if a bit clunky. The audio is acceptable but the NC circuit introduces a noticeable hiss when turned on. The hiss is somewhat dampened or at least easier to ignore when you use the headphones in a noisy environment such as an airplane."
3,If it wasn't for the whitenoise...,"This was my first pair of noise cancelling headphones so you have to take what I say with a grain of salt. Not having any other headphones to compare these to, I think that you get what you pay for these. When the noise cancelling feature is off, these headphones have a great sound quality that beats any of my other headphones, but once the noice cancelling feature is turned on, the white noise is hard not to notice. I was also disappointed with the actual ""noise cancelling"" feature. I think that it works best with low pitch noises like dryers and cars, while it looses its effetiveness with TV's and music. I was tempted to return these headphones but ultimately kept them for the quality when the n-c is turned off."
4,smal colorfull diamant !!,"This book gave me a real good impressium of the colorfull treeworld of Hawaii. But not only the flowers can be seen in this book, also the fruits (edible or not) from the trees of Hawaii are not forgotten. I hope in the future there will be another book about trees of Hawaii with more pages, so that I will be more informed over the wonderfull trees of Hawaii (Inculding Bananas and Palms). When you read this nice book you surrely know what I mean."
4,solid performance,I enjoyed this movie that dealt with some difficult journalistic issues and handled them deftly. I always enjoy Alan Alda in any role as well!
2,"""HOW YOU FEELIN' TODAY CHAMP?"" OH.. ABOUT 40 %! .....2 1/2 STARS!","It's a shame to let such a good premise end up being such a mediocre movie! 'Resurrecting The Champ' could have been a great film, but it ends up feeling about as deep as the puddle of u r i n e ""the champ"" leaves in his alley every night! We never really learn anything about him and the story is more about a mediocre journalist trying to prove himself. Josh Hartnett lacks the acting skills to do anything with his role and there are a number of side stories that are distracting and the time could have been used developing a real story about this ""down and out"" boxer. Samuel Jackson turns in a good performance and it's the first time I can remember he wasn't shouting his lines at everyone in a film! It's OK for a rental, but I wouldn't waste my time on a second viewing."
2,Not worth the time,I am very open minded and like almost every type of movie. My favorite genre is sports inspirational and/or true stories so I'm typically biased to like this style of movie even more.The truth is that this one just didn't make the cut. I watched it on cable for free and still felt that it was a waste of my time.
3,What You See...,"Jackson's performance in this film was top notch, though the rest of it left something to be desired. With an interesting enough premise the plot became quickly predictable, which made Hartnett's character just seem a bit slow. I also kept waiting for some deeper insight into the politics of the sport in hopes of shedding light on why some of the Champ's decisions were made, to no avail. Interesting but not fantastic by a long shot."
2,Boring Story,Sometimes I am wondering at reasons some movies have been created for - this one of adds and odds of a former boxer belongs exactly to these works.
3,Not all inclusive,"This book is all about the systems and equipment, how they work or not together. It does not go into decor of said equipment. No themes or anything like that, just the tecnical mumbo jumbo. It seems to focus on higher end equipment as well and does not give each manufacturer of stereo/audio equipment equal reviews or ratings. Some are just brushed over, barely mentioned. It is a good starter book, but definetly does not cover all aspects of a home theater design."
2,Over simplifying...,"I bought that book on the previous ""don't buy this book"" review. I feel like should have listened to it.In my opinion, the analysis is oversimplyfing the problem so the whole thing has not much theoretical meaning nor practical use.Only my opinion."
1,Only a couple of pages talk about importing,"It seems as if the author just used a generic ""How to start your business"" book and included some high level, obvious facts about importing. This book did not help me at all. It has no useful information whatsoever."
1,Out of date,This book should prove to be of no help to anyone. The technology recommendations are completely out of date and there is little information on Importing/Exporting. I found it a waste of time.
1,Totally useless. Several hours of your life you can never get back.,There is nothing in this book about importing or exporting. It is about starting a business in general and is full of information you could obtain in one average business magazine. Total waste of time.
3,"Good Design, Poor Workmanship","The design of the easel is nice and assembly was a snap. The workman ship of the easel is where this product lacked BIG TIME! The paint looked like it received one really quick coat on almost all the pieces. Most pieces had the paint chipped and cracked. Now with all that being said, it was really easy to get replacement parts. My opinion is that it is a known problem that workmanship is weak due to the fact how easy it was to order replacement parts. KidKraft has a sheet included in the box with a website to order parts. I thought about returning the product right after opening the box, but I assembled it anyway and ordered replacement parts. After it was assembled the easel is very sturdy and the kids LOVE it! The imperfections of the easel don't stand out after it was assembled (thought not an excuse for the chipped, cracked poor coverage of the paint). I would purchase again only due to the fact ordering replacement parts was so easy and the kids really do enjoy it."
3,Got just what I was looking for!,"The product was everything I expected. The only issue we have had is with the white board not erasing easily, have to use a cleaner to get everything off. Has not had a lot of use to base anything longterm yet."
1,AWFUL DO NOT BUY,We purchased this easel as Christmas gift for my 6 year old daughter. Since we have tried to put it together has been a nightmare. We have contacted the company twice because the did not send us the right legs for the back of the easel. I was told the legs would be In and overnighted!!! Well still Waiting!!! The wood is very flimsy and cheap!!! The trays are as well and have cracks and paint smears all over ... Not worth money !!!!!
4,Solidly built.,It was easto assemble as long as you follow the directions. It looks very nice and beautiful finish. All parts are very durable.
5,"Solid, durable, multi-purpose easel","I researched many easels before purchasing this one. It includes a chalkboard, white board, and a paper roll at the top, which can be pulled down for drawing. I bought this for my twins' 3rd birthday. Now, they are 4-1/2 and they and their friends continue to get a lot of use out of this. The only problem is that I regularly have to tighten the screws to hold parts of the easel together. Also, the cups which hold paint are not really necessary and I would have preferred that there were not holes in the trays for the cups. Otherwise, I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Circuit breaker,"Delivery was fast, and product works as promised. I am not perfectly convinced that the product is new, but works fine."
2,not very punchy,"I was hoping to find the Original 12"" version of Endless Road and I get one with sound effects and that Jet plane sound which they used a lot on so many remixes.Why don't they just use the ORIGINAL 12"" mixes and save the effects for the later stuff."
2,not worth the money,"This book provides several examples of making transgenic crops - weat, triticale, rice, corn, barley, peanut, etc. For some reason, examples published are not always best of the field. I have an impression, the examples are chosen pretty randomly. They do not include simpler novel technologies like apex shoot transformation and flower dip, although by the time of the publication these technics were available. The review of the material is poor, authors mostly just present their data published somewhere else. For the book super high price I expected much more, and pretty much disappointed."
4,Great Work but a Little Dry,"This book is a handy book in learning about Islam, its doctrine and history. Rahman's approach is at once senstitive sociologically and also a little apolotgetic at times. This book is written by an intelligent ""insider"" It does not address questions about terrorism and should not be read as a way of informing a personal hatred against Muslims but should be read and is best read as a book that introduces readers in an understandable fashion to one of the world's ""great"" religions and agents for cultural expression and change. This book is about a religion- its theology, philosophy, sects, and its history- not radical anti-Western political movements.My criticisms of this book are light- it is a bit dry and a bit academic at times. Also the typeface is sometimes a bit hard on the eyes but not annoyingly so. But overall it is a great work and a classic on a great religion and I highly recommend it for all those who would like to begin learning about Islam."
5,One of the best intros to Islam,"It's written for someone with some knowledge of the basics of Islam. Extremely well-organized, highly analytical and scholarly. It ranks with ""Islam and the Destiny of Man"" as the best intros."
3,"Islam, and Rahman's approach","I am a student taking a college course. It was recommended reading. I found it easy but slow going. That was not Rahman's fault, It moves along in a careful historical manner. While trying to make sense out of a many sided religion for many different countries, Rahman presents an accurate but is covering all the bases. It drags on. The media is constant about terrorism. I realize these are aberrations of particular groups. Rahman does not deal with the abberations. Good book,with a bit of work."
1,Disappointing,"This may be a terrific scholarly work, but it is NOT for someone with a limited knowledge of Islam, who wishes to learn more. It is Not easy to read and presupposes a basic understanding of Islam. I bought the book after reading the reviews by others. Just shows that you can't always trust them."
4,Great book for beginners!,"I found this book very usefull in picking up Mastercam, has good chapter review exercises after each chapter with easy to follow CD-Rom examples."
2,Weakly written,I was in search of a text to use as reference. I found this book and bought it but it is confusing and repetitive. The drawings are poor quality and just 2D.I can't see surface machining in the book. The CD is just the demo cd from mastercam. You can't save with it or anything
2,Far from Complete,"The ""student version"" Cd that is included is nothing more than a demo version. You can't save files.There should be mastercam exercises from the book on the cd or video lessons.Basic 2D is covered but not anything else. Book from Mastercam Handbook from San Diego Cad Cam much superior"
5,Learning Mastercam Mill Step by Step,"This is an excellent book. It is very easy to understand but it spend 4 chapters to teach how to make a drawings, few minor mistakes but it is critical to new user (you got lost and you need read again and again to understand it was a mistake),and few exercises we can not do it because of the demo disk. I still can follow through whole book even the mistakes and/or I can not do the exercises.Most of us use other professional cad software. I will recommend the author concentrate how to convert other CAD software, how to rotate or translate the axis, and do the measurement on the converted drawings.I recommend you read this book first if you are new to MasterCam like me.I am not a machinest and I learning this just to see I can produce G code for machining. I don't know which book I should read after. Any recommendation?"
2,Not bad but not great,I would have preferred less repetition of simple tasks. We couldn't find info on subprograms or horizontal milling. This book could be half the size. Ok for schoolkids but industry use needs more indepth book for the software.
4,Worthwile text on Mastercam,It is very difficult to write a text suitable for tecnicalschool and college undergraduate level at the same time.The authors have accomplished this.With this text you can begin learning to program in Mastercamfrom the first chapter.The CD included makes familarization work without the expenseof buying the full program.
2,confusing and messy,The CD is the free demo CD available from resellers. Too many 2D examples. No 3D at all. No progression between chapters.
5,Learning Mastercam Mill Step by Step,"As a professional in the fiel, I found this book to be a valuable reference guide and teaching tool. I highly recommend it to those who are serious in the field."
2,"acceptable, if simplistic","Acceptable for school, lacking for machine shop purposes. Nothing on machining molds, dies. Same 2D over and over again."
3,good but basic,As a conplete novice I found this book very useful.I liked the note like style of the writing and found the general setup information time saving.
1,Can't get the demo to load.,"I bought this book to sharpen my skills. The book is good, but the DVD is useless. If you already have a copy of Master Cam. The book is helpful; if not forget it.Learning Mastercam Mill Step by Step: Book & CD"
2,not too bad,Not too bad of a book. It deals only with 2D milling and is a bit too expensive for such limited scope. Reference books from mastercam or dealers are more in depth for less money
2,A little simplistic,"Respectable book, a little pricey for what you get, not as well illustrated as the tutorials available from mastercam dealers."
2,Not a very impressive book,"Considering the size and price of this book, there is no mention of 3D programming. The book is filled with pictures that are confusing and messy and not even real screen shots of mastercam. The examples don't progress with any real logical sequence. Just page after page of similar 2D parts with little explanation and a lot of white space. There are better books around to learn mastercam from."
1,Junk,A play on so many words that I am surprised that I did not notice the connection with the popular book.
4,An Easy Shot,"Someone had to do it. The legions of working people who have to put up with a boss or a HR manager who takes to heart the asinine and prosaic teachings of Ken Blanchard (One Minute Manager) and his ilk needed someone to write a book like this to verify that they have not gone mad and that some management books really have gotten dumbed-down to the point that ""Who Moved My Cheese"" can become a serious bestseller. This book is amusing, and it takes all of fifteen minutes to read, but it really deserves to be purchased; and then anonymously mailed to every clueless boss who thinks grown people should be treated like children."
1,Poor Quality Product,"1) Uneven seams2) Straps unusually narrow and pieced together3) Only interior cups cotton4) Hand wash only assuming due to spandex5) Flimsy6) Comparable, in my opinion, to a $5 product found in discount stores7) Amoena being a non-American company, in my opinion, does not measure up to American standards8) Shipping label was not offered when spoke with Customer Serivce9) Company requested post office insured return, of which cost $16.50 to Express mail, as priority is not guaranteed by the post office"
2,A Bohm Steer,"In my estimation, Karl Bohm made perhaps the best ever ""big band"" recordings of the Mozart symphonies for Deutsche Grammophon -- but they were with the Berlin Philharmonic, not the Vienna. These performances with the latter aren't even pale imitations of the Berlin renditions, and that's especially true in the No. 41. No verve, no clarity, but at least they played the notes that were on the page, I suppose. Anyway, if you want the Nos. 40 and 41, or the late Mozart symphonies, or essentially all of Wolfgang's symphonies, they are available in the marvelous performances by Bohm and the B-e-r-l-i-n Philharmonic. My suggestion is to go for all of them in the relatively recent boxed edition -- there's a lot of music but reasonably priced, so you won't be going for broke."
1,Tombs XL & XLI in the Valley of the Kings,"And taking the body of Pharaoh Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - Horus Mighty Bull, Arising in Thebes - Lord of the Two Lands and the Nile - Son of Ra, Powerful of Forms - Enduring of Kingship - Horus of Gold - royal undertaker Karl Bohm (near the Land of Two Fields himself) and the Viennese embalmers extracted his brain via the nostrils, surgically removed his organs and placed them in canopic jars. Accompanied by many a chant, the priests then transferred the royal cadaver to a bath of salts. Once thoroughly desiccated, the mummy was anointed with oils and perfumes. It was placed in a sarcophagus which was stamped with many a yellow cartouche. Thereafter the mummy's mouth was opened in a final ritual to symbolise its life after death.O Amun, great is thy praise."
2,"No, no, no!!","There is some fine playing by the Vienna led by Bohm here, but two glaring differences here just leave a bad taste in this listener`s mouth.The 1st movement in No. 40 is done waaay too slow. Just under 9 minutes?! This is Mozart, not a dirge. This movement is my favorite of Mozart`s music, but here, it`s almost unrecognizable.The 1st movement in No. 41 ends just after 8 minutes, and does not repeat the music like many other conductors do. Just feels like there`s something missing here.Check out Karajan`s 1977 DG Galleria performance or Levine`s digital DG Viennaone for excellent performances.Too inconsistent for the 2 greatest symphonies of the greatest composer.Too bad."
5,Excellent,"I have been using these speakers for about 1 year now. They are much better than the ones that they replaced. Great sound quality, easy mounting, and they have proved to be durable inside my full face helmet. Highly recommended!"
5,great sound,"This was a great purchase, bought it for my husband's birthday, he loves them. Says the sound is fantastic. Good price and great sound"
5,Beautiful!,"I just heard Mintz's Paganini Caprices for the first time, and I came immediately upstairs to my computer to write this review. I am amazed! I have heard a number of versions of these over the years, and I must say, none compare to this.Those who reviewed Mintz's cd ahead of me said it better than I can. I just want to put an exclamation point on theirs. If you have any doubt at all, put it aside. Shlomo Mintz makes the 24 Paganini Caprices sing, and with absolutely astonishing technique. The beauty of his playing of the 24th Caprice is unsurpassed, in my opinion, including the many renditions of Rachmaninov's Rapture on this theme."
3,A students opinion,This is probably the most popular recording of Paganini's Caprices. Mintz does a very good job. His sound quality is very good as well as intonation and speed. This is a good pick if you are looking a good recording of the 24 caprices. Salvatore Accardo also plays it very well although the recording job wasn't great.
4,Decent Product,"The flags serve their purpose. They stick well, and don't fall off/get knocked off easily. They blue and green tabs are somewhat dark so any writing on the color parts are a little hard to see. The pen is a nice gel pen. The pen will smear though. I'd recommend the pen more for writing on paper than on the tabs. Overall it's a good product."
4,It's a Coloring Book!,"This is a nice little version of Disney's Sleeping Beauty, but be aware - it is a coloring book. I thought I was buying a regular paperback Golden Book. Was I surprised! As far as coloring books go, it is a nice one. The story of Sleeping Beauty is told from beginning to end. There is a wide variety of things to color - animals, fairies, people. It's also fun because of the ""shape"" feature; it's not your usual rectangular book. Unfortunately for me, I wanted a pre-colored book to read to my daughter, but if you are looking for a coloring book, this is a nice one."
2,No tape; very disappointed,"My 3 year olds are really enjoying the books on tape that I grew up using. I thought it would be fun to add some Disney books on tape to our collection. I read the title and description very carefully and understood that I was buying a used item. When the item arrived, I only received the book and not the tape. Obviously this was completely useless for my purposes and I was very disappointed since the description and title stated that the tape is included. On the bright side, Amazon paid for the return and processed my refund very quickly."
4,Like TV was meant to be,"""Wallander"", the 1st series, is television like it was meant to be. All three episodes in the first series are well written, forcefully acted and brilliantly realized. Each episode grabs the viewer from the get-go and never lets up."
5,Great adaptation of the book.,Excellent performance! The book comes alive with these adaptation of the book. The outdoor locations and the elements of the plot are well preserved on the screen version.
5,Dark and quite entertaining!,"This series is a very dark journey into the human psyche. It is very entertaining, well acted, and the cinematography is breathtaking! I have truly enjoyed it!"
4,Wallander British Mystery,I have long loved British TV. The mysteries are among my favorites. I am thrilled to be able to watch these thru Amazon Prime. I get to do my own TV scheduling and watch this on Sunday nights like it used to be shown. A great show.
4,Great show,I love the very different tone and style of this detective show. It makes you wait for the punch line so to speak and it is well worth it. Mr. Branagh is great and the supporting cast gives great detail.
4,These are excellent movies,I would recommend these movies. The actor is brilliant and the script is very well done. I enjoyed it partially as a lot of it was filmed on location rather than in a studio and I am always curious to see 'the world'.
2,make sure your blu-ray can play,"Make sure your blu-ray player can play this set. Import which unfortunately is recorded as 1080i/50Hz which is a Euro format. Although Blu-Ray eliminated the old PAL versus NTSC distinction, certain Blu-Rays like this one require a Blu-Ray player and a TV which can broadcast 50Hz recordings (unles the Blu-ray player converts 50 Hz to 60 Hz). I have a sony bdp-550 which cannot handle this, so be careful before you buy."
3,Improbable Plots,"Gorgeous photography, excellent acting, but utterly ridiculous plots, to the point of being laughably silly. Of course suspension of disbelief is necessary to some extent when watching TV shows, but in all three of these shows the story lines were so far from making any kind of rational sense that they overwhelmed the good points.Another criticism is that having Brit actors, as good as they are, play Swedes in an extremely Swedish setting just doesn't work. I really like Kenneth Branagh but the roles call for people like Stellan Skarsgrd or Max von Sydow."
5,Chicago Charm,"Great charm. I went to Chicago and couldn't find a good charm for my ""travel"" charm bracelet so I looked for something after I returned home. This was a perfect souvenir of my trip. Very detailed and looks great."
2,Too sensationalist for my taste,"While the encouragement this book provides to return to the sacraments and pray the rosary daily is something I'd never argue with, I was disappointed in the book nonetheless. First of all, they badly needed an editor - the same material is presented over and over, and they slip into a ""National Enquirer"" style that I found annoying. More importantly, ""Thunder"" relies far too heavily on unapproved private prophecy, and fails to adequately defend its position in light of Scripture and Tradition. For a far better work on the same subject, read Desmond Birch's ""Trial, Tribulation, and Triumph"". It's meticulously researched and relies on approved private prophecy only as an ancillary source."
5,A must read to all Christians,"This book is very informative, inspirational and a must read to all Christians...i've been looking for this book for so long and i'm glad i found it. I want to thank the authors for compiling such important messages for all the people to read..i salute you for your Godly work! I ordered 2 of this book and it arrived on time and in very good condition..thanks AMAZON!"
2,This book isn't for you if you want Mary's REAL message!,"This was the first book I ever read on Marian apparitions. It almost turned me off to the real message of Mary. The book spends almost all its pages outlining horrible visions, i. e. destruction of the earth, three days of darkness with demons swirling all over the place, the Antichrist, and on and on and on until you're scared half out of your mind. Some of this stuff is so disheartening that I wondered, what exactly is the point they're trying to make? They spent too much time on these fatalistic visions and a lot of negativity instead of focusing on the real point: turn back to God and pray often. Read the Wayne Weible books on Medjugorje if you want to understand the true meaning behind Marian apparitions. His books were truly uplifting. These authors do nothing more than scare you and make you feel powerless to stop these nightmarish events. That's not the point of Mary coming here."
3,Watchable follow-up to Epoc,This second installment is a interesting but bland continuation of Epoch. More of a good vs. evil orientation to the devices. A good Saturday afternoon movie.
2,Virgin birth and alien space ships,"This movie seems to be a sequel to one in which a boywas born ( virgin birth) from interaction with an alien ship/ monolith.It has aliens, religion and what appears to be 'magic'technology all wrapped up together with no hard science any where to be found.A chase move where religious fundamentalist sent an hitteam to take out the boy and his father.The boy has Jesus like resurrection of the dead powers:they call him the one from within.Not the best sci fi film ever:it seems to be one made with very littlethought just for a mass market."
3,fast delivery,I got the CD is no time at all . I was surprised at how fast I got it. The only bad thing I can say is one of the CD's has a scratch on it so it skips. For the price I can live with it. The music is wonderful
2,cheaply made prada bag,"The prada bag has very low quality materials. The nylon felt so cheap and terribly made I returned it. I had a guess brand bag that had better nylon than it by far. You expect the prada bag to have superior quality for the expensive name brand. I only paid $50 but it had a crooked prada logo outside of the bag and a bubble with chipped off paint of the prada logo inside of the bag. Because it was so cheaply made I question the authenticity of the bag since I had compared it to a real prada bag. However, if you're looking for a small black prada bag that can fit a cell phone, wallet, keys, and a small pack of tissue that just has the prada logo slapped on but may not be authentic then this is a bag for you. The bag does come with the certificate of authenticity but I spoke to a prada representative at prada's headquarters and was informed that you had to send it in their warehouse so they can identify if it's authentic and the card was useless to authenticate it."
2,Strappless,"I bought this bag as a gift for my friend that helped me out with my wedding. I was so excited about the gift and the cost. I quickly found out why it was name brand and so cheap. After the second time my friend used the purse the strap broke. We thought, no big deal it was only one side of the strap and then a hour or so later the other end pulled out. The nylon is fine, the look is trendy, the bag is real it's just the stiching quality sucks. I have no odea how to return it so i have to take my friends bag to a seemstress. How embarassing, I look cheap."
5,"Very nice bag, and I received it free!","Why pay for it, when you can get an original Prada handbag for Free! I got mine from this web site: ilikethis.info/handbag"
4,Time for the Red Carpet,"As a man who was born in the year of the Horse,I believe this to be a damn fine handbag.Although nylon is not my fave, Prada pullsthis off with grace.That is all I have to say about this product.Don't hate you mofo's."
1,Disappointing Prada,"I thought wow a Prada bag for under $80 (the price has gone up since Christmas). I was very disappointed. I ordered the purple color (I am sure it has a fancier name). When it arrived, it looked like a cheap nylon bag I would find at Target for $10 (except Prada name). Also, the handle is too short and not adjustable. Not impressed at all!"
4,4 star review retraction,"I bought this bag in black because I have it in red. The red bag i've had for over 5 years and is in GREAT shape. I've had the black bag from amazon a little over 5 months and part of the handle is breaking and the logo is coming off. cheaply made bag. I must say i'm extremely disappointed. I thought maybe I got a lemon, but upon reading other reviews, that doesn't seem to be the case."
5,"""Blazing"" up the charts!","BLAZING UP THE CHARTS...Well, Def Jam Vendetta is back, but, this time, it's ""The Fight for New York""... This game has it all... A great storymode, an awesome multiplayer mode, and more options than you'll know what to do with...You can create your own character and guide him through different levels/events that will score you money/experience points/girlfriends/etc... You can use your money/experience points to unlock new characters/levels, bling bling ; ), secret moves, etc. This game is very deep, and it will keep you busy for a while, trying to unlock everything... The difficulty level is adjustable, so, you will not get bored fighting at the same level... The control is great, the player models are seamless, and the levels are well laid out... I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of wrestling/fighting games/or just the hip hop industry in general. (so you can fight as your favorite entertainer)"
3,AWESOME at first,"Def Jam fight for NY is a street fighting based game with devastating moves and intense fast paced action. Game makers showed great attention to detail. For example your fighter will make mean faces when they throw their fist at someone! and squint and shun away when a punch is thrown at him! Also, If you lose, but you still put up a good fight, the scene of your opponent mocking you at the end will show the damage you caused to your opponent! An unprecedented 74 total fighters to choose from, (of course, most of them will have to be unlocked this helped with replay value.) You can shop for clothes and jewelry to help with your charisma, which in turn helps your momentum while taunting your opponent in fights. Lots of fun and challenging as well. If you liked Vendetta you will love this. The advancements are amazing. The graphics are killer. Sound is OK, music is OK, and overall replay ability is good."
3,where're the real reviews?,"I would like to read reviews rather than social commentaries about this game. Does anyone out there has something to say about game play, etc?"
4,"Rap, Hip-Hop and Wrestling!!!","Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: P.K. The GreenIt's nice when a company has faith in it's unique franchises. And with a company as big as E.A., you would have faith too.I'm talking about Def Jam: Fight for NY. Boasting some of the biggest names in both hip-hop fashion and talent (who lend their voices to the game) really adds to the authenticity of the culture the game portrays.The fighting engine is easily compared to the classic wrestling titles on the N64. This is a good thing, as some will say these are some of the best games of the genre.There are 5 fighting styles, which as you progress, allow mixing between them. With unlockable's including wrestlers, venues, and merchandise, there is plenty to keep you playing. Fans of fighters and hip-hop shouldn't miss this one."
4,Worth the price,Great music. Awesome moves. A little hard to get used to but well worth the struggle.
5,LOVED IT!,This movie had me laughing the whole way! I love Amy Poehler. She definitely made this movie good. Can't wait to see it again!
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"I got this film because three great comedians are in the title roles: Parker Posey, Amy Poehler, and Rachel Dratch. Through some screwy plot, the three of them end up on South Padre Island in Texas, at college spring break. If you're looking for skin, as one might expect in a spring break movie, you can forget it. There is nothing sexy about this movie and more important, three good comedians are totally wasted in a plot that makes them look like members of the PTA caught in the Animal House. Even my favorite actress in a comedy, Parker Posey, can't save this terrible movie."
3,Party girls,"This is one in a long line of recent comedies about adults acting like a bunch of teenagers. Spring Breakdown is at least a somewhat better comedy in that at least it's funny at some point and isn't as vulgar as most of what passes for comedy these days. The three women have different responses to reliving spring break, from trying to win popularity contests to refusing to conform. Rachel Dratch plays a particularly funny role with her dry humor."
1,UGLY AND UNFUNNY -- MINUS FIVE STARS,"Everyone connected with this movie, behind and in front of the camera, above and below the line, should apologize to anyone who bought, rented or saw this alleged film (even if it was a free screening).Furthermore, all those who participated in the creation of this unfortunate, unfunny, and ugly enterprise should be put on probation and not allowed within 500 feet of a movie studio or any kind of camera equipment for at least five years if not life.Think I'm kidding? Well, don't -- I am not.It staggers the imagination to conceive under what circumstances a collection of adults could have possibly considered this a viable project in which to invest time and money.The box art is the high point of any entertainment value. But it's all downhill when you open the box and insert the disc and push Play."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by this video. What really put me off was the presenter's very poor golf swing and that led me to feel distrutful about the rest of the material. It felt like the presenter/author had just picked on golf as a subject for a yoga video rather than looking at what golfers really need. I purchased another title at the same time and found that much more useful. I am sure the yoga postures featured were well done and would be beneficial but the poor golf content really let the whole thing down. I know it's not a golf instruction video - but maybe it would have been better had the yoga postures been put into pracice by regular golfers, or co-presented with a golf pro."
1,Do not buy this video,The video lacks substance. It is grossly obvious that the producers have very little golf knowledge.
1,save your money,six simple stretches you can get in any stretching book without having to endure watching the instructors swing.
5,The song that started it all.,I remember hearing this beautiful song at the age of 9(I'm 22 now)and I've been a fan of Enigma ever since.I love the sound of the monks chanting and the tune of the music.Sadsness Part 1 is one of those songs you need to listen to full blast on your stereo system or diskman.Just lay back and enjoy the wonderful songs that Enigma as to offer.
4,"No one seems to know Enigma, but they know the music. Why?","Although the ""Sadness"" is misspelled for the actual ""Sadeness Part I"" you'll see on the cover when you order it, a rare Imported-from-Japan single does use the ""Sadness"" spelling (this isn't that rare one). Though three of the four tracks are different enough to be called remixes, two of the tracks are rather tedious and melancholly (#'s 2&4). However, the CD is a must for collectors and for those who like to listen to music not on the original album. The Album edit version is by far the most popular version of the song that swept the world in 1990, though my personal favorite is track #2, the Violent US Remix. If you decide to become an Enigma collector, try hard not to scratch the disc. I did that and had to wait for over a year before I could get a second copy.--MF"
4,Fat mattresses only!,"These are great quality sheets. However, I had to return them. I have a standard full guest bed (no extra deep or pillow top) and the fitted sheet would almost wrap completely around the mattress. Try these if you have trouble with sheet creep on your ""fat"" mattress."
1,A bad book to start with..,"This book though looks simple and pretends to present concepts in a lucid manner, does not match international standards. Very few examples are present with less/no illustrations. I struggled with this book for almost 2 years to understand the concepts as this book was the only popular book in my UG college and was readily available in our library. It has ideally no practical examples which can easily discourage reader. After reading contemporary books from Prof Roy Yates and Prof Leon-Garcia, I could do little favor for this book by giving 1 star.However, one who is already thorough with concepts can use this book for revision. There is a huge element of risk involved in starting with this book to learn probability concepts."
2,"Very little examples, no answers in the back of the book","This book does not have enough examples in the text. I tend to learn better by example and this book is not for people like myself. Also, there are no solutions to any of the homework problems in the back of the book. So you can't check your answers to see if you are doing the problems right."
3,Middle Ages Magic,"David Macauley`s ability to visually place you on a scaffold, building a 400 foot tower on a Medieval church might cause you vertigo, but the sheer skill he has of placing you there as one of the builders is truly astonishing. Admiring his beautiful pen drawings is part of the excursion, and like the cathedral, you ask yourself, How did he/they do that ? However, this is a savagely truncated collection of drawings from his much more complete orgignal publication. Too much is left out. Going through it is like being on a cheap tour of Europe - 45 minutes to gape, then the bus leaves."
4,Stay True To Your Old Skewl,"I remember back in 1991 a friend I worked with (Brian) told me about an old project he and Gary were apart of called Benestrophe. I had the opportunity to hear some of the tracks that never made it to print...amazing stuff to my ears. I met Gary once at the Bonham Exchange here in San Antonio, great guy. It's so odd now some 12 years after the fact that I listen to these albums and they hold a grand significance to the time. This two disc set is an exhaustive collection of the brothers' Dassing earliest work. It's a adrift with flavors of industrial, ambient, and ebm. Fans of Skuppy and old FLA will appreciate these guys immensely (you know who you are). The ideas and layers and flow of each release amaze me with every listen. Choose your favorite elixir and enjoy..."
5,Useful and strong,"I have not used this to boil tea, but rather to hold baking soda with fragrances mixed in.These sacs are pretty strong, and seem even reusable. Very nice."
2,TOO NARROW,Let me start by saying ouch!!!I saw these shoes and they looked great. Rockport is suppose to be the most comfortable shoe... These ae not.I do not have a wide foot so I would never consider bying a wide shoe. If you foot is not pencil thin and you really want this shoe buy a wide.Also if you have a high instep this shoe is not for you.
5,Chill Factor,"This is the best kind of book, one that you don't want to put down because you just have to know what happens next."
3,Parts were tedious.....,"I found this book to be strong at the beginning and at the end. Half way through, it became a chore to read. I found myself skimming just to get pass that tedious part. The last half was hard to put down and held my attention until the end."
3,7 out of 10,The only thing I didn't like was there was too much emphasis on religion......this spoilt it for me. On the whole not as good as some of her her stories but it was an easy read. I would give it 7 out of 10
5,"Loved, Loved, Loved This Book!",I read this book and loved it! I sent one to my friend who also loved it! Then I bought the Kindle edition and read it again! The twists in the plot are marvelous and you really cannot predict the end!
5,Keeps you guessing until the end,"I have read just about every one of Sandra Brown's novels. This one was great, just as I expected. I thought I had it all figured out, but the surprise ending was just that a surprise! I won't spoil it for you, but you must read it. And it does help the days feel a little bit cooler thinking about them in the snowstorm."
3,Grade B,This book was well written but alittle over the top. Way to far fetched but I guess that's why we read fiction. I was kept interested by the book and it's many characters. The characters seemed to have quite a few aspects to them Brown seems to always do this very well in her books. Her romance in the book seems a side benefit (typical of her) than the main story. I enjoyed this book but it was not one of bests. Try Envy!
4,A good read!,"Sandra brown is an excellent author, and she writes both mysteries and romance. This one is a combination of both romance and mystery although it is mostly centered on the romance. There are many characters and stories in this novel, but it only makes the overall story more interesting. Although i pretty much guessed who ""blue"" was in the middle of the story, there were may twists that made the story interesting all the way. All in all it was a good book, not her best but still good. If you want to read a great book by sandra brown then look up charade, because it is definitely a great read!"
5,Better then I expected!!,"When I saw the excerts from the book before it was on the shelves I knew I wanted it. But when I read the first few pages I thought to myself ""Oh no. this is gonna be predictable."" Although I thought I had figured out the plot in those first couple pages I was wrong. This book led u thought many turns. Just when you thought u knew what was going on she throw something new at you. Awesome!"
5,ALL FACTORS EQUAL EXCELLENT!,"This is the best Sandra Brown book I have ever read, and I've read most of them.Ben Tierney and Lilly Martin were outstanding and all the other characters were terrific!Suspense, tension, 'did he or didnt he', passion were all involved. The setting was a whiteout snowstorm and it was portrayed chillingly! Even in Florida, (am a former New Englander), I could feel the cold, experience all the emotions of the characters; and even tho you will probably guess who the bad guy is, you do not want to do it willingly!!!This is a gut wrenching story, vividly done. I read this book in one day - just could not put it down until I reached the end.Each chapter ends hanging out there, and you rush thru the next to seek the answer! (boy, was I easy or what?) :DDid not enjoy some of the last Sandra Brown books but this one has restored my faith. Well done!"
4,Everything I wanted,"When I read a Sandra Brown novel, this is exactly what I'm looking for. Intense suspense, plot twists, steamy love scenes. I read a wide variety of genres in literature and Sandra Brown is one of my favorite for the murder mystery steamy sex genre. Also check out Nora Roberts."
3,An OK read!,I enjoyed Sandra Brown's books up to this point. This one left a bitter taste of disappointment in my mouth.
2,Abridged CD is empty....,CD/abridged/Romantic Suspense: A friend loaned me the paperback a few years back and it was okay. This abridged version was not at good as the paperback. It was very empty and I disliked the townspeople more in this version. There were so many plot holes and red herrings. The police procedure stuff was completely unrealistic. The narrator did a great job.
2,cheap climax,"Warning: you may find the spoiler below:I didn't like this book because the climax was just too cheap. In the last 30 pages, the FBI discovers that Ben Tierney can't be the killer b/c he's the father to one of the missing girls. What the heck? Does it get any more un-realistic than that? Go with some Dean Koontz books instead."
1,Chill Factor leaves you in the cold,"This is not romance, it should be listed in the murder/porn book isle. Ms. Brown has always consistently delivered romance until this book arrived."
1,HATED IT,"THE NEW SANDRA BROWN ,THE SUSPENSE AND ROMANCE TOGETHER I DO NOT LIKE. FOR STARTERS SHE TENDS TO MAKE CHARACTERS NOW WHO ARE LESS INTERESTING THAN HER SET UP OF TWISTS AND TURNS. SHE NEEDS TO REMEMBER FANS KNOW HER FOR HER ROMANCE. I JUST DONT LIKE HER NEW WRITING HER OLDER BOOKS WERE BETTER. CHECK OUT SLOW HEAT IN HEAVEN. THATS HER AT HER FINEST. THIS CHILL FACTOR BOOK I COULD NOT EVEN FINISH, THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS."
1,Disappointed,"It usually takes me a day to finish a Sandra Brown book, but it has taken me more than a week to plod through this drab book. The lack of chemistry between the love interests and a plot which moves slowly to a predictable ending makes for a very dismal book. Hopefully, SB's next book will be up to par."
4,Kept me guessing.,I couldn't put the book down. I thought it was clever the way Sandra Brown kept the reader guessing. The romance part is small but still there. Good story!
2,just misses the mark,"I like Sandra Brown and really enjoyed Ricochet. Perhaps my expectations were too high when I picked up Chill Factor. The possibilities were there with an interesting plot but the characters were ""over developed,"" thus giving the plot away early in the game. A good analogy might be the artist using too much paint on the brush. The result is predictability in terms of ""who done it."" My other gripe with Chill Factor is that the middle 100 pages got pretty tedious--too much detail and not enough suspense. Other reviewers didn't appreciate the sexual detail. I did not find it to be gratuitous; in fact these encounters were integral to the plot. This was an OK read. I liked Ricochet much better."
4,Page after Page with Lots of twist and turns,"This story kept me reading page after page. Sandra Brown created a cast of characters, i.e., Lilly Martin. Dutch Burton, Ben Tierney, etc., that they come alive in the small town of Cleary, NC. This mystery was written is such a way that it kept my attention clear to the very end. It was an easy read with some tense moments and some great plots that have lots of twist and turns."
4,"Good, But Too Long","I enjoyed this book, as I do with most of Sandra Brown's books. However, it felt like this one went on forever, and had a lot of characters to keep track of. Knocking off a hundred pages and eliminating some of the supporting cast probably would've earned it 5 stars."
5,Great,"Fast paced and loved the setting in the mountains, (of course I'm a country boy) very realistic and I loved all the twists and turns. Great read."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was not up to Brown's usual standards. The plot is awful and the characters are revolting. It was difficult to have any sympathy for any of them, and at times I found myself cheering on the bad guys as our intrepid heroine was such a useless piece of humanity. While I realize that this is fiction, there should be at least some believable elements in a book and they were sadly lacking in this one.If this had been the first book I'd read by Brown it would have been my last. I really don't understand all the rave reviews this book has, it's one of the worst books I've read this year and I go through at least 7-10 books a week."
4,Scintilllating Suspense,This is an another winner by Sandra Brown. It was Suspenseful with a great ending. The novel starts with the disappearance of several women in which the crime was never solved and unknown killer who leaves a blue ribbon behind each victim. But Besides that the citizens of this town seems to hold a lot of secrets and where everything and everyone is suspect. You will have a great time with this book and you won't put it down.
3,Just OK.,"I won't review the plot as it's already been done by other reviewers.1. Usually in Sandra Brown's books we get more of a physical description of the characters through out the book. All I figured out was that Tierney had blue eyes and Lily was tall with dark hair. This made it hard to picture the characters.2. Too many different people and plots.3. All the action was at the end of the book and there was no resolution for the secondary characters.4. While Dutch was a serial adulterer & quite flawed he didn't deserve what happened to him, Wes deserved it instead.5. The end was lame.If this is your first Sandra Brown book don't let it put you off of her. She's a very good writer and I can recommend ""The Witness"", ""Unspeakable"" and ""Mirror Image""."
3,I expected more detectiving,"This is another book recommended by a co-worker, who warned me it might not be what I typically read. I really liked the suspense and trying to figure out who the killer was; and I enjoyed the descriptive writing. I dropped two stars for what seemed like exploitive sex and 'creepiness'. I also had a problem with the portrayal of the SAC and some sterotypes that seemed to be placed on him in excess. And finally a few technical errors were disappointing. I would have preferred that some of the pages spent in the bedroom would have been spent describing the clues found or the thought process in arriving at various conclusions. All in all, glad I read it, but it's not a must-read to me."
2,Left me wanting more...,"The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money."
3,Chill Factor = tepid,"Sandra Brown missed it by ""that much"" with Chill Factor.It wasn't a total waste of time. Sandra's books usually aren't.Chill Factor was missing the one element she almost always nails:a kick-butt, strong, independant female lead.Lackluster is one way to describe the characterization of the romantic lead in this book.There are many characters in this one. The book hops aroundto them all, several pages at a time. Nothing very in-depth.A murderer is loose. A handsome stranger is in town. The town of Cleary is just another Peyton Place.Chill Factor is riddled with derivative plotlines and a plethora of stereotypes.Having said all that, it was still a semi-enjoyable afternoon read.Don't pay full price for it, especially the ""pocket premium"" edition at 10.00 bucks a book.<the only thing premium about this new format is the price> It's worth it at half-price."
4,Chill,Another good story by Sandra Brown. A bit predictable but it kept my interest throughout. It is not her best but I would recommend it .
3,Good story but..........,This is a good suspence story but could have done without the filthy language. That distracts from the book and makes the characters unlikeable.
2,BOORRRING,If this is your first Sandra Brown book dont make it your last. I have always enjoyed her books but this was an exception. It jumped around to much Kept thinking it would get better. Finally skimmed the last 75 pages. Not up to her usual.
3,Rampant accusations and rumors run wild,"Lilly Martin has packed up her old cabin and is ready to go back to Atlanta. Her ex-husband, Dutch Burton, the Town Sheriff, is reluctant to let her go. Driving down the mountain, Lilly has a near-fatal accident with Ben Tierney, an avid outdoorsman. They end up back in her cabin for the duration of the storm. Lilly is not sure what to feel about Tierney as more information unfolds about him. The town of Cleary, Georgia is on edge because of the presence of a serial killer who has claimed the lives of four local women. The FBI is called in to try to make progress on the case. Some characters are cardboard-thin and are not well-written. Good suspense despite a few secondary stories that make you feel like they were thrown together at the last minute."
3,Chill Factor,"This is not one of my favorites. I have read alot of Sandra Brown's books, but this one wasn't up to my expectations.The entire book takes place in the span of only a few days. While Lilly and Ben are trapped up in a cabin owned by Lilly and her exhusband Dutch, Dutch and others make it their mission to rescue them.I didn't find the characters very likeable. Dutch Burton is a very dark violent character, with very few redeeming qualities. Lilly is a weak willed person with no loyalty easily influenced by others, and Ben is a manipulator to the highest degree."
2,Two problems,"Sandra Brown is capable of pure art when she uses words to describe people's thoughts and behaviors. This talent of hers kept me reading Chill Factor. But I almost put it down for two reasons.In the first half or so of the book, Ms. Brown had so many technical errors, that the story lacked credibility. Where were her editors? Later, we have Ben, whose life is at stake, who is unwilling to tell Lilly or anyone the truth about his connection to the deaths. Any logical person would have not only explained but would have offered evidence to get out from the predicament that he was in. In short, technical details and a key link in the plot were way too weak."
4,The Chill Factor Sent a Chill Up My Spine!,"This chilling murder mystery involves characters fighting against the elements during a massive snow storm. It is also about the characters fighting amongst each other while searching for the truth. Sub plots abound as characters struggle to find the serial killer who has plagued their New Hampshire town. Scandalous secrets are revealed one by one. The romantic tension in the story is balanced by the powerful element of mystery. Chills run down the reader's spine each time one character is suspected to be the murderer. There are as many twists and turns in the plot as there are hairpin turns on the icy, impassable mountain that the rescuers try to mount. The ending is filled with surprises. Wonderfully fun book!"
4,Sandra Brown Knows Suspense...,"I really liked this book (which has always been the case when I pick up a Sandra Brown book), and had a really hard time putting it down. There's so many twists and turns you never know what's gonna happen next, and just when you think you've figured out who the killer is...nope!I do however agree with another reviewer on the point of most of the characters are weird and very unlikeable. Cleary, N.C. is the epitome of a back woods, red-neck, hillbilly southern town. The only characters I really liked were Lilly and Tierny, everyone else was creepy and seriously messed up.That aside though, the plot and direction of the story were excellent. You never know which way the tale's gonna go, and the ending was a complete surprise and very satisfying. I've never before been disappointed with one of Ms. Brown's books, and this was surely no exception."
5,Imaro,I really enjoyed this book . I found this book to be the kind that you just can't put down. Imaro fought all his life for the things he wanted. I would definetely recconmend this book to read.
2,"Rolodex Stacking Side Load Tray, Letter, Black (62555)","Decent design. However, the one I received was uneven and wobbled at first whenever anything was placed in it. I bent the support bar underneath to even it out. I'm glad I didn't pay more than I did for it. Overall, it is still functional though."
4,Black Letter Tray,Sturdy and attractive tray. Matches other products that I've purchased here on Amazon. Easier to keep clean than the smoked or clear plastic trays. Worth the price difference. Thank you.
3,incomplete,"It is not in the least bit surprising to me that George Curry and Cornel West (two avid supporters of affirmative action) would purport to compile a an unbiased collection of the arguments for and against affirmative action - and yet unabashedly omit the writings of Dr. Thomas Sowell, who perhaps more thouroghly than any other scholar, has researched the subject - not only in the United States - but in cultures and societies throughout the world. My only guess as to why they wouldn't choose to include his writings on the issue (such as the one published in the Neo-Conservative Reader or excerpts from his book on preferential policies) is that if they did - there wouldn't really be an ""affirmative action debate"" at all."
1,Sled is good. Powersports Superstore is BAD,I have spent weeks dealing with the rude customer service at Powersport Superstore. Any savings you may gain from using them is not worth it. BUYER BEWARE.
5,Nice Collection,"I have a tendency to buy two or three compilation CDs per year (Cafe del mar, Miguel Migs, etc...). Most times, I feel lucky if I find two or three tracks I like. This CD has eight tracks that I have as top picks in my iPod. It's a great mix where the two discs have a distinct difference in style. One song blends gracefully into the next. If you are a novice to the genre of music, as I am, then this is a great choice."
3,"really like deep dish, did not really like this",i think what made deep dish special for me was their ability to surprise me.there are no surprises here...just a lot of ok tracks with some peaks here and there...nothing bad but nothing exceptional.i expected more.
4,Selmer Review,"In just under two years, the duo known as Deep Dish, have released three flawless two-disc sets. 1999's ""Yoshiesque"", 2000's ""Renaissance"", and now ""Yoshiesque 2"". All three have their own unique sound, yet it's hard not to think of them as a trilogy. Their first and only (so far) studio album, ""Junk Science"", was disappointing. Nothing, it seems, can capture the energy and strength of their DJ sets. ""Yoshiesque 2"" is not so much a sequel as a continuation of excellence. Lighter on their own remixes than the first, ""Yoshiesque 2"" is everything a fan could hope for. ""Morel - Funny Car"", and Danny Tenaglia remixing The Daou are just a couple of high points on a set filled with them. Both accessible and underground, ""Yoshiesque 2"" gets my vote as mix disc of the year, and it will be a hard one to top. Similar Artists : Armand Van Heldon, Danny Tenaglia, DJ Sneak, John Digweed, Darren Emerson."
3,No More CD's....,"I was so excited to see this product for sale, and I was stoked on getting it. As with time, all cd's go bad, and both of these cd's had seen better days. Overall, for the price, it was great, but I think I will stick with digital downloads."
