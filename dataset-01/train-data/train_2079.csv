1,Still not getting it,"When I posted a negative review of a toy HIV virus last year, my fellow Amazonians accused me of lacking a sense of humour, not understanding the educational value (!) of the product, etc.I admit that I still don't get it. What so fun about Mad Cow disease? It can be transmitted to humans, and is fatal. Other ""educational toys"" in this product line include ""Flesh Eating Streptococcus"", ""Multiple-Resistant Staphylococcus"", Lyme Disease, Swine Flu, Food Poisoning and - wait for it - Ebola.This is supposed to be fun?Call me old-fashioned, but I think giving the kids a toy symbolizing a deadly disease is...well, sick. Or at the very least, diseased."
3,this isn't a review but a question which to buy dvd or vhs,many dvd's are even cut more than there old vhs originals I'm just wondering if I'd be better off buying the vhs version than the newer dvd version.Anyone who may have seen both versions please reply.
5,Quaint,"Anything that can inspire MatronsApron to write a song about it must be of some merit. A compelling series of mystery stories, each with its own type of clanicity."
1,Miss Marple II,"I LOVE Miss Marple played by Joan Hickson. This Christmas I decided to add to my collection- I already own Agatha Christi's Marple- The Classic Mysteries Collection. When Agatha Christi's Miss Marple - Set II came in the mail, I realized that ALL FIVE episodes were ALREADY on the Classic Mysteries!!?!! WHY would they have the line about ""people bought these together""... or NEW on the box? Or set II??!! You are doubling up! I should have checked better, but maybe this will save someone form doing the same thing..."
4,Miss Marple wins again,My mother and I have been watching Agatha Christie mysteries for a long time. This Miss Marple set was one of the best Mother's Day gifts I have given her. We both cuddle up and watch some great movies and never guessing whodunit. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery.
5,Agatha Christie's Miss Marple Set 2,"Total home run from start to finish! Agatha Christie, Miss Marple & Joan Hickson-a triple threat that delivers!!! I will probably watch them repeatedly over the years & will completely enjoy them every time. AAA+++"
5,Another winner from Barbara Cook,"Can this woman do no wrong? This new album seems to indicate that she cannot. She has this way of making you feel that you are in a small, intimate room where she is singing just for you; the chat between songs is wonderfully personal bringing in her and others' reminiscences, not just the usual ""this song is by ....."". Wally Harper accompanying Barbara is his usual wonderfully understated but perfect addition to her performance. I had the pleasure of seeing Barbara last summer in a ""Master Class"" at London's Donmar Warehouse where she tok a bunch of young singer/actors through their paces - dressed simply in a sweat suit andsneakers she was an inspiration to the young people and to the audience. Seeing her again later in the week in performance was equally inspirational and electrifying. Long may Barbara Cook reign as queen of the divas!"
4,Heartwarming romance,"This novel was a first of Reding's novels for me to read. It won't be my last. Reding weaves a delightful and heartwarming tale in Flora MacCallum's SECOND CHANCE. The widow, Flora, is the kind of mother that all kids should be blessed with. But she's also a woman; as composer, Gavin Matheson soon finds out. And Reding's novel is laced with a bit of suspense as well. There was only one scene that gave me cause wonder as to how that came about. And if I told it, then I'd be giving some of the ending to Reding's plot away. And I wouldn't dream of doing that. Then too, it's just me I suppose, to wonder how that could have happened that way. Maybe I read too much. Regardless, Reding's novel, ""The Second Chance"" is a heartwarming and tender romance novel, laced with a tad of suspense, and well written with good characters. What more could a reader ask for? I recommend it."
5,Fast service - beautiful handcrafted,This is an unusual and wonderful product. I feel lucky I was able to purchase it while they were carried. It's very unique and adds interest to your decor. The colors were happy looking.

5,Make old pencils new again,"My kids won't use a pencil once the eraser is used up. Buy these instead of more pencils and they're like new again. The scent is fun, but not why I buy them. Lots of fun colors."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,These erasers arrived in a ziploc bag and were all wet. I guess the seller sprays the erasers with some kind of spray. Just go to your local dollar store or super center to buy some erasers.
1,cheated,I received a sandwich baggy filled with 30 pencil top erasers that were soaking in cheap perfume. I could have purchased the same erasers at Target for probably $.50 and instead I paid enough for a few hundred. Do Not purchase from this supplier.
1,Would never buy this product,"I would never buy this product! They are just regular erasers that are put in a baggie and an ""alcohol based fragrance"". You DO NOT see this in the discription when you are viewing this on the Amazon web site you only see this ""fragrance based alcohol"" statement after your purchase is complete. I am currently trying to return this item and get a full refund!"
1,Lysol Erasers,"These erasers arrived at my house in a ziploc baggie after a long wait, and they smelled like Lysol. They were wet with what could be Lysol, and the child I ordered them for was not impressed at all. All of the colors smelled the same (you guessed it, Lysol). I wouldn't ever buy these again. You would be better off making them at home with some Lysol, erasers, and a ziploc bag."
1,Scented Erasers,"I ordered these erasers for my grandson for Christmas. They were shipped quickly but I was very disappointed in the packaging. They were packaged in a kitchen baggie without product information or any paperwork at all. They are very lightly scented so don't expect a color to signify a certain fragrance. They are brightly colored. I checked on line to see how to return them and found there is a restocking fee, shipping charge and in return I would get a store credit. I was very disappointed with this purchase."
2,Average,"Overall, I thought it would be more interesting and challenging than it is. Not much movement inside the game. I'm afraid that opening it up will prove to be a bad idea."
3,Find-it,"We bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift, to replace the one that my son broke. The one she had before came with a timer, and this one did not. If I knew it was missing, I would have found a different one. Overall, she was very surprised and happy with the gift though."
5,Great toy for all ages!,I have been looking for this for two years and was thrilled to find it here! Great for all ages!
4,Kept my husband busy for days!,"(Until he found the penny) Oh yeah- and my 4-year-old loves it, too! It's very addictive, but I must say that once we found the penny (and everything else), it hasn't been played with much since! Nice gift- and great conversation starter...like someone suggested leaving it on the coffee table for adult get-togethers!"
4,Surprisingly fun,"At 4 and 6, my kids are below the recommended age for this toy. However, they both have a good time shaking and twisting it trying to find all the objects. It's a great item to throw in the car or luggage for a trip since it is self contained.Like other reviewers, I would rather see a broader variety of objects instead of the 26 letters of the alphabet. Even my 4 y.o. knows his alphabet cold - I'm not sure what educational value the letters would have for kids in the recommended age range of 8 - 13."
4,This game is great,"This game keeps whoever is playing it entertained for hours. It's almost addictive trying to find all the hidden objects. There are a few items (penny, egg, marble) that are very hard to find and it's truly rewarding once you find them. All kids and adults alike that have picked up this game at our house loves it and wants to get one of their own. Highly recommend and great for the car."
2,missing items,My daughter got this for Christmas. It was alot of fun. Found the penny but still had 10 things to find. Could not find them. Opened it up and sure enought it is missing ten items on the list that are supposed to be in it. I can see maybe one item but ten.
3,Boredom sets in quickly,"Bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She played with it for a while, but quickly lost interest and now it sits on a shelf. We will pull it out again on the next rainy day and see if we can gain more interest."
3,OK,"Low calorie and low carb, two good things about this product. The taste, weird. Better than Tazo and Pacific chai powders (no soapy after taste) but being low carb, it's not a taste delight."
1,Very Disappointing,"This chai is very, very sweet and has no spice taste whatsoever. Sorry to say, this is going in the trash."
3,More A & C from A & C,Not their best or most memorable work but certainly solid entertainment for A & C fans.
1,Available From WB At A Cheaper Price With 4 Other Films Also,"Just a heads up to the consumers. I see that WB is also selling these two A&C films probably in the same quality since they released both sets but also packaged with 2 3 Stooges and 2 Laurel and Hardy films. FOR A CHEAPER PRICE! Thats the deal, not here. Looks like they took this exact same DVD set and slipped it in a bigger sleeve for the other discs. http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Comedy-Teams-Collection-Laurel/dp/B000HWZ4F2/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1341684120&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=classic+comedy+teams+collection+wb"
2,YOU WON'T BE LAUGHING !!,"In my opinion this DVD release is a total slap in the face to Abbott & Costello fans. Warner home video should be ashamed of themselves with this release, the video transfer quality is absolutely terrible. After watching this double feature, it's evident that no amount of restoration went into this DVD release from Warner. While Abbott and Costello fans will find the movies funny, they won't be laughing over the video quality.DVD Features:Abbott and Costello in Hollywood theatrical trailerLanguages: English & FrenchSubtitles: English, French & Spanish (feature films only)"
4,DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS,"The picture for both movies look fine. This is not a flipper disc. Both movies are on the same side of the disc. Both have English and French audio. Both have English, French, and Spanish subtitles. Abbott and Costello in Hollywood has a theatrical trailer. Lost in a Harem does not."
2,What Happened To The Transfers?!,"Although it's a great idea to feature both of these films as a 2-fer DVD, each one suffers from bad transfers. The worse of the two being ""In Hollywood"". There is a strange blue/gray blemmish at the top of the film that lasts throught the entire movie. While the films are not the best made by Abbott & Costello- thanks to MGM who never knew how to make comedies, they are still fun to watch and are a must for completist geeks like myself."
2,Worst Book Design EVER,"The content of this book is excellent, but who cares? You can't read the stupid thing because the design is so bad it absorbs all your attention trying to ignore it. I would offer concrete examples of the design flaws, but there are so many it's overwhelming to even begin. Also, the organization of the book is haphazard. For example, the visuals seem to land anywhere but where you'd expect in relation to text flow. I would value this book much more if it were set in Courier and held together with a rubber band. The production team was definitely out to lunch when this monster made it through the approval process."
2,OW! It hurts my eyes! (4th Ed.),"They may know printing, but the 4th ed of this book is not readable.Every single left and right page border contains CMYK registration marks. Cute idea, fine for a front page, but the stark color contrast is constantly distracting.Chapter headings are migraine-inducing 3"" x 7"" YELLOW hyper contrasted with blinding full-on CYAN. Other headings are set off with CMYKCMYKCMYK color chunks that are twitchiness defined.All the text is sans-serif font. Please have mercy on your readers!This is exactly how not to design a book. A kids' cereal box, maybe... a book, no. The 3rd ed is much more refined and readable, why oh why did they assign this design to the amateurs?My recommended antidotes: 1) anything by Edward Tufte. Start with ""The Visual Display of Quantitative Information""; 2) Robin Williams' ""The Non-Designer's Design Book""."
5,Excellent reference,Im a Graphic Design Professor and been working in the Industry for 26 years. This book is still UPDATED for the techniques. From the PDF and production to the tablets to book layout creation. A must have for every student or any person who wants to know how prints work. I bought NEW and receive a PERFECT product. No shipping problems like other sites. Enjoy!
5,Very pleased.,I was very happy to purchase this book for a considerable savings. This is a required text for a publications class I'm taking. Our campus bookstore was charging around $50.00 for a new book. I paid less for a new book than what they were charging for a used one!
5,WOW! What a great lesson!,"This is the perfect way to get ready to go out on the dance floor with any partner to do any dance! When you take the lessons on this video, you will learn so many exciting dances - and fast! At first, I wondered if I would get confused with the variety on the sampler. But after taking this lesson, I learned that when you have good instructors, any confusion is quickly converted to confidence. I found that as my skills started to develop, I wanted to go back and view the video again. This is a dance lesson that keeps on giving - anyone at any dance level will discover something new to learn!"
5,You won't be disappointed! Great!,"I highly recommend this DVD for beginner dancers who want to learn couple's dances. Shawn and his his wife break down the steps in a way that is easy to follow, even if you've never danced before. I purchased this DVD to learn for my upcoming wedding. I thought I would have to pay for private lessons to learn; now that I got this DVD I know I won't have to do that. This DVD is great and you won't be disappointed; you also save money from paying for private lessons."
3,"Not enough time, not enough steps.","This movie was OK, but not impressive. Each dance only taught two or three basic steps, and there was not enough practice time with the music to truly feely confident about those steps. My fiance and I did learn the dances, but not without much pausing, stopping, rewinding, and frustration. I am a modern dancer, and pick up movement very quickly, and if it weren't for my ability to break-down and explain the movement, we might not have gotten some of the more difficult moves."
4,WAY BACK HISTORY,"I find this book very interesting regarding the Historical Era involving the British Redcoats and the conflicts with Indians during the early settlement days. If one is seeking to find names of men, from that part of the country, who might of fought under General George Washington, this is great. I am interested in a later Era of Shepherdstown History, so I have found it to get a little boring after a while. It describes how the British Redcoats mistreated the Prisoners, during the fighting around Boston and New York.I have not finished the book, but do hope that it will contain the Era that I am seeking."
3,Will try again....,"I bought this with the sole purpose of using it on my calve after knee replacement surgery as I had pretty severe bruising and pain in that area. Either I started on it too late or this ointment wasn't strong enough, but I had no relief from the discomfort and the bruising did not go away. But I will try it on something less severe the next time. I'm not writing it off yet."
2,Didn't work for me,Bought it in the hopes that it would help aleeviate the pain of shingles. It didn't
5,A must have for people who bruise easily!,"I bought this gel to treat and prevent bruises. I bruise very easily, and they take weeks to go away. This gel helps them heal really quickly, and has kept me from bruising as bad when I use it right after an injury. It's not sticky and smells nice, but not overpowering."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON BRUISES,I purchased this product for bruising on my face and it had absolutely no effect whatsoever. This product does not work on bruises as advertised on the label.
4,Good for the money,"So Far, it seems to be working for us, I used it on a bad bruise on my leg. It's healing faster than I expected. I think it's great stuff."
4,Arthritis? Get it.,"If you have arthritis (osteo or rheumatoid) you should try arnica gel. It works for my RA pain in my hands. It helps take the edge off the pain when I'm having a flare. The effects are mild and it doesn't last long, but it is worth it to have a tube around for when you need it. It's not a miracle product but it does do some good.I'm not convinced it works on bruises but I usually rub some gel on anyway- can't hurt."
2,Arnica Gel,I ordered this because I heard someone say they used it after a surger they had and it helped with the pain. I figured I would do a pretest with it and use it on my back before my actual surgery and unless what I received is expired it did nothing for me.
3,Boiron review,all fine - arrived before it was supposed to and it is doing what it is supposed to. thanks Portland
5,Amazing Product!,"Amazing Product! I have knee, ankle and back problems. I've used pounds of products and $$$$ in the pass on so-called pain relief illusions!This really works! Do I need to say more?"
3,Arnica Gel,"Arnica Gel 2.6 oz.I ordered this because a French friend swears that arnica helps bruises heal faster than they would otherwise. At first I was feeling very positive about the product but ulitmately, felt the bruise took just as long to heal as any other bruise I have ever had ... The gel is soothingly cool tho'."
5,Buy Boiron--Arnicare,"This is a great product that, after a series of spider vein treatment injections, left me a lot less black and blue than I thought I would be! Super absorbent,too! No medicine cabinet is complete without Boiron - Arnicare Gel. It's value priced, also. I purchased the same exact product in a much smaller tube at the doctor's office for the same price! So this one is a real value. Oh, and the mail order process was quick and seamless, too."
3,Completely over-rated,"This was supposed to be his masterpiece, at least when it caem out but it is completely lifeless in my opinion. He has done better stuff since."
4,A good overview,"This book gives a good, but.... quite ""general"" (and sometimes a tad sketchy) overview of wines from Burgundy.I recommend it a sort of ""pocket"" reference book. I would certainly take it along with me on a visit to Burgundy but it would NOT be helpful in planning an ""in depth"" tour of Burgundy before hand."
2,Where's the patchouli?,"I bought this as I had discovered that it has patchouli oil listed in the ingredients. I'd had a shampoo in the past that had patchouli oil in it and it was great to keep the doggie odors down as it left the scent on the dog for some time after bathing.Well, this shampoo wasn't the one I had before as it leaves the dog smelling like a wet dog. Patchouli might be on the label, bit it isn't prominent in the shampoo. I'll continue my search for the shampoo I had before, or at least one of the same quality. Unfortunately this one doesn't fit the bill."
1,Amazing Leaps of Illogic,"After reading this book, I'm convinced first of all that the author is an undisciplined thinker with a lot of money to pursue his hobby. His writing smacks of stream-of-consciousness thought flow, and I found his uncanny leaps of illogic very disconcerting. It appears he has an axe to grind. His desire to pursue the truth no matter where it leads -- is missing. He has already decided what he believes, and therefore does not have the grace of an open mind. In his defence, let me state that the photographs in the book are extremely well done."
1,Small factor flaw caused a big mess.,"Does the Taylor factory in China not use heat tempered glass? Unfortunately the Taylor thermometer I bought had a hairline crack in the bulb. This crack turned into a giant fracture when the bulb came into contact with my confection and the glass tube broke. I had to throw out both the new [[ ASIN B0000CFQN8 ]] Tayor Classic Candy-Deep Fry Thermometer and the candy, which could have had glass shrads in it."
1,broken glass in food,"two of these have broken when making yogurt rendering the batch dangerous to consume. both broke at the tip, when we bought our fist thermometer we had bought one for a friend, hers also broke whilst in use so that is three that we know of that have broken. the product is flimsy and not fit for the purpose for which it was intended."
1,broke on fifth use,"On about the fifth time I used this, the bottom cracked off and melted into the oil I was heating. Obviously it ruined my oil and I was stuck without a thermometer for the evening. Shouldn't it be able to stand the heat? I am guessing that it cracked at around 340 degrees. Frustrating!Taylor Classic Line Glass Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer"
1,PIECE OF S*** - USED ONLY 2 TIMES,Taylor Classic Line Glass Candy and Deep Fry ThermometerJust finished a phone conversation with a supervisor from Taylor. I called because the Glass Candy Thermometer's blue liquid separated during a fudge making preparation. The recipe never did turn out because I wasn't sure what part of the blue line was accurate. I wanted them to replace all the ingredients used in the recipe. Supervisor said he would replace just the thermometer. I told him that I wasn't happy with his offer and that WHY would I ever take the chance of purchasing and using this product again. End of conversation.
2,Temporary At Best,"My mom and I do a lot of baking at the holidays, and when her old metal candy thermometer broke, she bought one of these to replace it. She ended up buying yet another one when we thought we'd lost the one she had just bought. Both are unusable now, and the oldest one was purchased near the end of 2010, with the other being purchased in 2011. One had a leak where water would get into it (but wouldn't come back out), thus making it useless. On the other one, the bottom broke (though the part containing the mercury was still intact and attached), thus making it useless, also. They're convenient, but they're hard to read and obviously don't last very long. I wouldn't buy another one unless I couldn't find anything better."
3,Shattered and straggly,"The record that followed his masterpiece, ""Den vassa eggen"". Two years later this record fell far from its predecessor. A good example of overproduced and typically dated mid80's-sound. Some songs remain among his best, especially ""Skyll p stjarnorna"".especially ""Skyll p stjarnorna"". Apart from that, the record is shattered between the brilliant opening, ""Klockan och korset"" via pop-alike ""Kid"", Waterboyscopied ""Alskad igen"" and some less than memorable songs. The record's loss for direction becomes eminantly clear with the ending, the titletrack with Lundell solo with his acoustic guitar/harmonica. A lot of ideas, a few good ones but mainly not. Maybe better to have kept some songs in the drawer and waited for songs of better quality (which came later with ""Evangeline""). Lundell is never boring or really bad, but this one will gather dust in the cd-shelf."
4,A good quality SciFi for young children,I would reccomend this book to emergant readers without hesitation. The illustrations are marvolus and the text is good as well.
4,Can we please have some MORE Jeeves and Wooster?,"first of all, i'd like to point out that the incident mentioned in the review by lupis1 takes place in the second season of Jeeves and Wooster, not the third. however, i do agree that this season has some very good episodes (though not as good as the second season).the major fault i have with the Jeeves and Wooster dvds, like many dvds in the same genre, is that there is little to none in the way of special features. an ""interactive menu"" does not count as a special feature. i would like to see some audio commentaries on some bbc dvds -- see what Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and Ferdinand Fairax have to say about the process of turning Wodehouse's memorable characters from book to screen.The characters are incredible, the plot-lines are hysterical. The best episode is ""Hot off the Press""."
3,3rd Season a bit Disappointing,"An excellent series, but unfortunately the 3rd season can't hold a candle to the first 2 seasons. That's not to say it's bad, it's just that the direction and some of the stories seem muddled - especially in the first few episodes. Furthermore, I haven't read the books, but there are about 3 actions by Jeeves in this series that seem COMPLETELY out of character.Worth watching, just don't get your hopes up!"
4,Jeeves & Wooster part 3,I will review as soon as the DVDs arrive. Not yet herre as of 19/03/2011. Is this normal ?
5,Adventures over the pond,"Jeeves and Wooster head over to America to get out of the clutches of an aunt who wants to marry Bertram off to Honoria... while not a fate worse than death it is certainly worth approaching with some trepidation.The adventures of the two Britons in prohibition-era America make this perhaps the best of the series. It's too bad that some of the same actors couldn't be kept along for the entire production but still, it's the writing that really carries the program. There are some great one-liners in this one!"
2,Wig,Too small for me. It said adult on the package but it was more like a child size.I was not pleased with this product.
1,Cheesey and a waste of money.,What a waste of money...it is very cheaply made and couldn't even use it because of such bad quality. My child refused to wear it out of the house for Halloween!
3,Funny Werewolf Wig,"Loved this werewolf wig from the front...the dark hair, pointed hair line, & the bushy side hair. However, I don't understand why the back was cut so short!"
2,Try GameFAQs if you need a guide,"To say the least, this is a terrible book. It offers no maps, nothing about the secret dungeons, no boss stratagies. Nothing. It is not worth anything you pay for it, except maybe 5 cents.If you need a Walkthrough for this wonderful game, GameFAQs has much better ones, for free!"
1,It pains me to even give this book a star....,"This, with out a doubt, is the most horrid excuse for a strategy guide I have ever seen. It contains no maps, no item locations, and no secrets. All it has is a collection of screenshots from the game, which are cryptic at best. There is a list of skills for each character but not what they do. I would say this is a good book for someone who doesnt want to play the game at all, but rather just see a bunch of screenshots from it."
4,Great Product,"The Presto works great. Using their guidlines to switch betweenlower heat only and dual heating above and below I have obtainedthe crispier than normal pizza I love. The only reason I didn'tgive it the extra star rating, is 2 really not that important cons.It takes a little pratice to properly align the pan on the machineand it has no on/off switch other than the plug itself. Minorcomplaints for an otherwise excellent machine at such a very lowbargain price. Worth more."
5,Best pizza you can make,Easy to use and care for. Pizza almost as good as your favorie retaurant. A must have for busy people who love pizza!
5,Presto Pizza Pizzazz,This is by far the best kitchen gadget I own. The pizza tastes great. It is ready so much faster than from a regular over. And I love it that I can burn the toppings without burning the crust.
4,Just what they wanted,This was a wedding gift for my son. He really wanted this because he remembered us having on when he was home. They will really use this item.Thank you.
5,This is so easy to use!!!,My husband loves the pizza oven and it is so easy to use! I couldn't have bought a better item
4,Great for the barracks or dorm.,"I used to own one of these back when I lived in dorm style housing. We didn't have an oven, so I bought one of these. It worked perfectly, was easy to clean, and I never had a real problem with it. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that if you do have access to a good oven, the appliance is a little redundant and takes up too much space. If you live somewhere with no oven, and you love pizza, I recommend it."
5,baked right,"The Presto Pizzazz Pizza Oven bakes the crust as well as the rest of the pizza to a golden brown, which is exactly the way we like it. When the directions are followed, the pizza is ""just right"" every time."
1,I really wanted to like this product!,"Unfortunately, this really is not better or faster than using the oven.I tried three different pizzas and followed the directions exactly. It's just not better or faster than using the oven so I don't want to waste my money or counter space on it. It's going back to the store tomorrow."
3,"Pizza cooker, GOOD NOT GREAT",I like this nify machine. Wish it:1.Could cook as fast as induction.2.Could serve me drinks.Thats about it. 3 stars becasue of 1..
4,My New Turntable!!!,"I've had this thing about two weeks. I've cooked a couple Zas and onion rings so far.I have a pizza oven @ work and that thing is always burning the pizza or whatever I put in there. The Pizzazz cooks really evenly. If it doesn't you have the option to cook either the bottom only or the top only.Cons: When it's plugged in, the turntable is spinning. It doesn't get hot, but I think it would be better with an on/off switch."
5,makes frozen pizza taste good,What can I say I never liked frozen pizza from the oven. Since I have discovered this pizza cooker I am finally enjoying frozen pizza. I love how crispy it makes the crust. I am still working out the timing on a thicker crust pizza but I will get it down with practice. I really like how fast it cooks half the time of waiting on a conventional oven. So I recommend this and it makes a great gift.
5,AWESOME,"One of the BEST purchases I've ever made! Cooks everything thoroughly. Pizza comes out better than a conventional oven. I use it for fries, egg rolls, onion rings, etc.....fast, easy, and perfect!"
5,Greatest Appliance Ever,"I purchased one for myself about a year ago and have used it more than anything else in my kitchen - no warming up an oven in the summer and heating the whole house, fast fast fast pizza, kids love to watch it... highly recommend to anyone that eats pizza even just once a month! We use it for other things as well... I'm purchasing three of these for relatives for Christmas!"
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"I would have given this a 5 star review, because when it worked, it worked very well. However, after 3 months of use, almost to the day, both the top and bottom heating elements stopped working. Now it just spins and spins but cooks nothing.I have contacted Presto about this problem, to see if maybe it is just defective, but I fear it is just the way it is. Will try to get a replacement from Amazon and update here with how things turn out."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"Different concept but results are good and repeatable; ability to bake the crust at a different setting than the top seems to be a fundamental improvement with this appliance. Cons revolve around storage and ability to handle only one Pizza at a time. Overall, we are pleased with this purchase considering the discounted price...$35 or so as I recall."
4,Saves a ton of time...,"I bought this product when it was part of the ""FRIDAY SALE"".I didnt have much hope for it but all in all I am please with it. I t will save tons of time on cooking and even cooks pizza's alot better than my ancient oven. It takes a little practice before you eventually start cooking them perfect. The reason for only 4/5 stars is that if you were to follow the directions given the pizza is never cooked all the way."
1,Am I the only one? Am I missing something??,"I just purchased this item because my oven has been broken for ages + I prefer to make my own pizzas. The concept of this item is wonderful, but when I got it home and cranked it up I discovered one very major problem. It doesn't cook the center. I made a 12"" + then another day a personal 6-7"" and it doesn't cook the center. I tried to push the pizza a little off from being centered so the middle would cook, but then the tray ends up with a serious tilt/slant and that just doesn't look safe. When it cooks the pizza it cooks the first 2 or so inches from the outside very well, but the closer you get to the middle, the less it is cooked. The upper arm/heating element is just not long enough. It doesn't reach over the center of the pizza. So... It appears that I am the only one that just can't see how this will work. Good luck to you!"
3,Pizzazz Pizza Oven,Works fine and the times setup for baking are accurate but you may need a lttle more time on the top if you add extra cheese like I do. The results are a soft crust and well cooked toppings.
5,A great kitchen appliance.,"When I got this as a gift I didn't think much of it other than a pizza maker, but this gadget can cook just about anything you can make in the oven and with no heat up time. I've cooked everything on it from pizza to vegetables to hors d'oeuvres.It's great for summer when you don't want to turn on the oven and heat up the house any more than necessary."
5,Pizza Baker,It's everything it is advertized to be. We also use it to toast tortilla chips covered with cheddar and jalopenos.
4,Mmmmm.... Pizza,"A fun, easy way to prepare pizza at home. The Pizzazz offers the closest to pizza parlor quality in the comfort of your own home."
5,Will buy another if mine ever breaks!,"My wife and I have been married for about 5 years, and we got this shortly after our wedding. We had it on our wishlist but nobody got it for us so we bought it for ourselves. We love it, pizza is my all time favorite food. I could eat pizza twice a day every day if my wife would let me. It cooks my Red Baron pizzas in 12-14 minutes each and they taste great. We always keep frozen pizza in the freezer just in case because all we have to do is just toss it on and wait. We use it every time we make pizza, we particularly like to throw one on before we start a DVD, and by the time the previews are over the pizzas done.I highly recommend this to any pizza lovers out there."
5,great item,"I have had one for years and love it for frozen pizza, especially in the summer when I don't want to turn on the oven. Recently purchased one for my son and he also loves it. Will probably get another for my daughter for xmas."
5,Best money ever spent on a kitchen gadget!,"I have had this product for a while now. It is by far the best money we have ever spent on a impulse purchase of a kitchen gadget. It is easy to use and easy to clean. It cooks evenly and it keeps from having to heat up the kitchen with the oven. We use this almost every week for something, either pizza or frozen appetizers."
4,"Hot, Bubbly pizza","My friend had me over for a pizza party earlier this year and he had one of these. All of the pizzas turned out great one after another. I knew then that I would have to get one for myself. It is especially nice in the Summer because you don't preheat an oven and therefore the house. It takes a couple of minutes longer than the directions on the frozen pizza box, but still less time than when using a conventional oven with preheating. everyone that eats pizza once a week or more should consider one of these. It allows you to add extra cheese or other toppings during operation to add your personal touch to a premade pizza."
4,pizza oven,"We purchased one of these a few years ago, and have enjoyed it very much. The recently purchased ones(2) were for gifts. This product is great for cooking frozen pizzas in about 15 minutes without having to use your kitchen oven. We have recommended this pizza oven to many of our friends and family."
5,Works as advertised,"Been trying to bake homemade pizza in my regular oven for several years with mixed results. Just tried my new pizza oven this evening and the results were excellent. Quick, easy, and the pizza turned out perfect. Highly recommended."
5,Great,"Perfect for pizzas and much more efficient than using a toaster oven. Can cook anything you can cook in a toaster oven, plus fits more food. Even toasts bagels, etc."
5,Love at first bite......,"Love this pizza maker!!...yes, i too was skeptical, i'm from Jersey so i gotta have great pizza....now that i make great pizza crust with 00 flour i wanted a good pizza maker since my oven is on the fritz....i made my 12"" pie, baked the bottom for 6 mins and then used the dual for 12 mins....perfect!....cheese was nice and bubbly, the crust was browned and the bottom was browned to perfection...love this!....i think it's better to assemble the whole pie and then put it on the pan, i didn't do that when i made the first one...so i had to put on the sauce/toppings while it was rotating....just assemble the whole thing and remember to just do the bottom first ....really, i was pleased as punch at how great my pizza came out on the pizzazz pizza oven!! :o)"
5,Presto Pizza Pizzazz makes great pizza!,Bought this for my husband. He loves to eat frozen pizza and pizza rolls. He says they are so much better using the presto pizza pizzazz oven.
5,Pizza! with Pizzaz!,I enjoy pizza and this product lets me cook one just to my liking. Speed of cooking is better without having to pre heat. Good Suff!
4,Pizza,"Love this oven can use it for french fries, nuggets and many things besides just pizza. I recommend this product."
3,Pizza OVEN.,THIS WORKS GREAT BUT AFTER A MONTH OR SO HE ROUND PAN GETS BURNT UP AND HAS TO BE REPLACEDAT A COST JUST LESS THEN A NEW PIZZA OVEN.TOO BAD PRESTO MAKES ITEMS THAT DON`T LAST.
1,"Good pizza, but not very convenient.","While the Pizzazz made a good pizza, it didn't do any better - and only slighly faster - than my oven and was more inconvenient. You can't cut the pizza on the pan/sheet that you cook it in, so now you have 2 pans to wash instead of 1. You can only make one pizza at a time - a problem if you are doing frozen pizzas and have one person yelping for plain cheese pizza and the other for pepperoni.It just takes up extra space in my cupboard."
1,A complete waste of money and counter space,"I have a friend who bought this ""time saver"" and it has been used exactly once and then put away into permanent storage. The basic premise of the Pizzazz Pizza Maker is that it cuts the time it takes to ""bake"" a pizza. Now I'm as busy as the next guy, but I am dumbfounded that anyone would give up the counter/shelf/cupboard space for this gigantic appliance in order to make a pizza in 12 minutes rather than 18. Unlike a conventional oven--which heats the whole pizza, including the crust--this oddly designed unit heats the top of the pizza, but the crust never gets to that satisfying mouthfeel that an oven-baked pizza does so effortlessly.This is the kind of device for people with absolutely limitless kitchen space and lots and lots of discretionary income. In other words, if you think it's a good idea to spend righteous bucks on a device that actually does a worse job of cooking pizza than a cheap pan, then by all means have at it."
1,Junk,"I bought one of these when they first came out.I loved it. It worked great and my family used it a lot.It finally stopped working, so I purchased another one from you.I'm sorry I did, because it doesn't work. It gets warm, not hot, and it takes an hour to cook the pizza.I will never buy a Presto product again, nor will my family. Companies used to make items that worked well and were worththe money. Now, its all about QUANITY, not QUALITY.I live on social security now and I don't have the extra money to send it back.I won't be ordering anymore appliances from Amazon.Virginia Dodson"
3,Ooooooh My!!!!!!!!!,I think it gave me butt cancer....but if you like your pizza hard on the outside and soft as a patatoe on the inside this is the product for you!!!
1,Horrible!,"After waiting for 5 weeks, I finally complained to Amazon that I never received the product. I finally recieved a refund---but my father in law never got his pizza maker and I now owe him a birthday gift. Do not order from this company. Why does Amazon not remove companies like this. The last time I ordered DVD's from a company on Amazon I got bootlegged copies and never got a refund-ever. So I would be careful ordering anything here."
5,"Fast, easy, cheesy pizza and snacks","We love the pizzazz...why heat an oven for 15 minutes just to cook a pizza, when you can have a pizza done in 15 minutes.....works great for frozen egg rolls, and makes perfect garlic toast"
5,LOVE THIS THING,This is my second one. My kid loved it so much he took mine with him when he moved. I win I get the new one
4,Great for New Years,Got this in time for New Year's works great. Perfect for pizza and appetizers. Cleans up easy and if you follow the booklet you can great results.
4,Pizza crust golden and crispy,"I saw this product years ago on an infomercial, liked it but never bought. When we had open enrolllment at work, there was a cooking demo and the person was using this to make personal pizzas. I was really impressed and purchased this from Amazon. I have cooked a frozen pizza that the bottom crust was so golden and crispy. Doesn't come out of oven like that. I have used it to cook frozen items as well. I really love it. Planning to buy one for grands as well."
4,Pizzazz Pizza Oven,"I gave this as a gift, but did see it working and it did a great job.Cooked the pizza in recommended time and no hot oven to contend with."
5,Makes Frozen Pizza Taste Like Take Out!,"My mother purchased this for me as a Christmas gift 7 years ago believing that ulitmately it would probably get shelved in some cupboard. However, all these years later, this is the most used product I own in the kitchen! This machine cooks any type of pizza to perfection. With the rotating pan, the food is cooked evenly on all sides and you can control how much heat you want on the pizza. I've never had an issue with the pan, except when it was accidently thrown into the dishwasher, then the brown spots appeared, but it still worked perfectly.If you love pizza, I highly recommend this product."
5,love it,presto pizza cooker is amazing. we love it. no more heating up kitchen. no more $40 takeout pizza
3,"Works Great, except I can't brown the sides of crust","This is a great gadget, and even though it takes just about as long as if I used my oven, it's still better than waiting for preheat, My main grudge is that no matter how long I could the top, the sides of the crust, especially rising crust never get done, I've tried regular crust, digorno rising crust, tombstone rising crust, freshcetta rising crust, and thought the top of the crust gets browned, the sides of the crust always stay a light whitish color, and never get that crispy feel. I wish I could say I was the only one who had this problem, but I've read other reviews that have the same problem. If anyone has any tips on how to get the sides done crispy brown, give me an email at [...] I would really appreciate it"
2,I think I just wasted $50...,"I saw the reviews and took a chance (life's full of them, right?) Sorry to dissapoint but many of the 3 star and below ratings are true. My ""Pizza Oven"" took almost an hour to warm a frozen pizza and all the cheese still wasn't melted. I think this machine/contraption is best used to warm food that has not touched a fridge or freezer. Something like you have a party and wings are getting cold, put them on the ""Pizza Oven"" and bam, in 30 minutes or more your wings are warm again, 'Nuff said."
5,Wow!,"I never thought I'd ever purchase a pizza ""oven"", but I am glad that I did. I was browsing Amazon and came across the glowing reviews. I am happy to report that Presto has exceeded my expectations! My pizzas have been turning out wonderful!!"
1,Would be great if it worked!,"I have spent the last 20 minutes carefully placing the tray onto the drive motor, and for 20 minutes it has refused to turn on. The instructions say that once you put the tray on the motor it should start spinning, but it does no such thing.I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I am following the instructions exactly, but nothing seems to work. I think I just wasted $60."
5,Pizzazz Pizza Oven,Ordered this to replace the Pizzazz Pizza Oven I purchased at least 10 years ago. I can't live without the pizza oven.
5,3 years and still going strong,"We purchased one of these about 3 years ago after reading all of the positive reviews. It is by far the most frequently used of our kitchen gadgets, and still sees use at least once or twice a week - pizzas, chicken nuggets, and tater tots are the most common targets. One tip I'd suggest is to buy some Reynold's Release nonstick foil and trim a 12 x 12 inch sheet to fit the circular baking pan before each use; this makes clean up effortless, and you'll never have to worry about scratching the (not really) nonstick surface. The only other way to improve it would be a slightly larger pan, since larger pizzas won't fit."
5,Must have appliance!,"The Pizzazz Pizza Oven is hands down the best appliance I own. I've had it for over 3 years now. I haven't written a review until I used it today and again was blown away by how good it is. It's not just for pizza. Any appetizer's you may have, potato skins, pizza rolls, they all work on this thing. It cooks everything to perfection. Pizza in the normal over, gas or electric, always ends up too crisp, burnt, too soft, burnt cheese.....you name it. Not to mention waiting for pre-heat to do it's thing, just wastes time and electricity. No Pre-heating for this thing, and it cooks the food fast and perfect everytime! Cleaning the pan is a bit of a pain, but who cares about that when you have perfectly cooked pizza?! A must have!!!"
5,Great product!,"I bought this on a whim, but it really works great. First tried a garden variety thin crust cheese pizza (store brand) - went from frozen to cooked in 15 minutes, and the cheese was perfectly melted and browned. I even think it looked better than if I had cooked it in the regular oven - the heating element is closer to the pizza. Been trying all sorts of other frozen pizzas and have been happy with the results. Clean up is surprising easy. So far all I've had to do is rinse and dry the tray and it's ready to go again. Next I'm going to start building some of my own, using those premade pizza crusts I've seen."
5,Great Choice,"I bought this product as a gift for my father in law because I have one that I love so much. If you live for Pizza you will love this oven! Its option to cook just the bottom, top or both is great! As for Amazon delivery - VERY VERY FAST. Ordered on a Sunday night and received on Tuesday afternoon even though it said it would take 5-9 business days. Overall great!"
2,Have you people ever had a decent pizza?,"I tried this several times, leaving heat on top and bottom, and also switching heat from top to bottom for varying times. The top was done excellently, but the bottom never got crispy. It browned, but the crust was just limp. Not a good product. I can't believe it got so many positive reviews. You're better off cooking your pizza in the oven, or even a toaster oven."
1,Pizzazz Oven,"Love, love, love this item. I use it for so much more than just pizza. It has become a main staple on my countertop. The shipping took about 1 week and everything was great. This is a must item for all kitchens!"
1,Lame,"I call this counter junk, and thats exactly what i thought of it when my sister gave it to me. I mean... this thing is just junk... what do you think an oven is for? Lamest present I ever got in my whole life... dont buy this"
5,Definitely Useful,"Don't be fooled by their prices. You can get this at Foleys for about $40 or less. This is, by far, one of the best kitchen appliances I have ever purchased. It perfectly cooks your pizza and you don't have to spend all that electricity/gas with your oven. Great investment."
4,fast food pizza oven,"My only problem with this little pizza oven was the ""non stick"" cooking plate. its not really that non stick. the problem was cured by placing a sheet of aluminum foil on it and spraying it with cooking spray. then you can just slide the whole thing onto a cutting board and dont have to worry about prying your pizza free. otherwise it cooks great, pizza is done and HOT in 12 min or less."
5,This thing is great.,"Great item. I thought it was a scam, but the thing works quite well. The pan doesn't always clean up well, but that could be because I use it with the dishwasher."
4,Delightfully Tacky.,"The product works as advertised; does a great job cooking frozen pizza. Tacky, but I show it off to my guests, :)."
5,Great product,"I bought this shortly before Christmas and I use it at least once a week. I used to make my home made pizza in the oven and the crust never would brown right. I tried pizza stones, precooking the crust and everything else I could think of, but nothing worked.With the Pizza Pizzaz I get great pizzas everytime, whether I make them myself, which my husband prefers, or use frozen pizzas."
5,GREAT Gadget!,"I'm usually reluctant to spend money on gadgets, but my niece had one of these and the pizza turned out so delicious when we used it that I went ahead and bought one myself. (Wal-Mart has them for $39.97). We love it, and as others have mentioned, it not only does pizzas to perfection, but also other things like cookies, biscuits, bagels, pancakes, nachos, quesadillas, toasted cheese sandwiches, all work just as well as they would in a skillet or oven if you are adventurous but experiment with caution."
4,Great product use often,"I love this pizza oven. It is so simple to use and extremely convenient. By the time I pre-heat my regular oven the pizza is pretty much cooked on the pizzazz. I would recommend this to anyone. It is especial use full for someone who eats a lot of pizzas or lives alone. I got one for my brother-in-law for Christmas, he and my sister eat pizza all the time and he liked using mine at my house. I know anyone who gets one will get lots of use out of it."
5,Great Product,"Love it, Love it, it makes frozen pizza taste better. My son would not eat a frozen pizza baked in the oven. But, he loves a frozen pizza on the pizzazz pizza oven. It cooks from the top and the bottom. Makes a great crispy crust on thin crust pizza."
5,Gets used nearly every day.,"We recently purchased this item. We have 4 teen agers and very busy home life. Seems it is used everyday for either pizza, chicken fries, bread. etc."
5,best product ever..,best product ever.. it cooks wonderfully but i have not cooked anything but pizza in it. can't wait to try more items..
5,best appliance we own,"We love this thing. In our house it is the ""pizza-a-nator"" and is used for pizza, mozzerella sticks, chicken tenders, warming up day old bread and leftover pizza, making quesadillas. It's great because it cleans up easily and heats up quickly."
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,I too am glad I got to listen to a few tracks instead of having to buy this straight out. I would never buy a CD such as this as I do not think it is Musically and Vocally worth anything...Only became interested in the first place as I wanted to hear the renedtion of 'Maybe I'm Amazed' which was absolutely horrible. (sorry but this is my opinion)!!!
2,ackniculous... whatelse,"these guys are like my fav rap group of all time. i wish they got the respect they deserved. that dude with the new wave afro - est-could rip da mic and really never curse. they had 2 great albums and then this thing. i don't have it and from listening to the clips-even at 2.99 on amazon - i don't want it. i hope wood-est and chuck are doing something in music and don't end up like that other fool from philly cool c.Laters,pimpdadde steve"
2,"....not their best. Actually, pretty bad.","The only misfire in the CR canon. Pick up ""Medicine"" or Body Hate/Body Love instead."
2,poor !,"my old scanner burnt out 18months ago or so.... it was very cheap .. and so I thought this time I'll buy better quality.. not so.. the ""film adapter unit"" consists of a light in the lid of course and, a cardboard like lid liner two pieces of plastic, (with two subpieces)and two pieces of black construction paper ( reminds me of my youth and being the first one to open the new breakfast cereal to get the punchout toys)Canon decided that one piece of paper would suffice for both 35mm slides and 120 ..so made the opening for the larger and tells us to cut our own piece of paper to fill the the 35mm opening .. the lid liner which must be added for prints attaches through some punch holes that I see becoming unusuable in about 10 removals give or take..ALL THIS at a premium price. and it's SLOW.. as slow as my old cheap model the scan is fairly quick the ""light adjustment"" time is interminable ! save your money !"
4,Explains concepts in great detail,"Unlike the Mcgraw series, this book actually goes through complete detail to explain to you why solutions turn out the way they do. If you're in a calc class, chances are, the books today suck and don't explain concepts well. Use this book as a back up for understanding concepts in order for you to go back in your main/home textbook to do your problems."
1,Overburdened with political preaching,"I found this book too top-heavy with sanctimony and political statements to be much of a read. Other authors' superheroes can fight for ""truth, justice and the American way"" without pushing the authors' own beliefs in one's face; unfortunately the high levels of pious preaching practiced in this book, together with the simplistic characterisation, made it very difficult to labour through to its end."
4,Captain America an old hero for a new generation.,"I enjoyed reading Captain America comics as a kid now I can relive the thrill in the novels. Captain America has always stood for the things that make this county great. He may be fictitious but the evil he fights is real in our world. This book can be enjoyed by everyone since it covers the origin of the Captain and his friendship with the Falcon. It's fun, easy reading and I would recommend it with the other Marvel novels in print. It's good for introducing young readers to Marvel character and for us comic lovers to be kids again."
2,Could have been much better.,"Call me a traditionalist. But I feel it was wrong to write a Captain America novel which deals with such topics as what happened in Waco, Texas in 1993 or the bombing of the Federal Building in 1995. It's a bit too controversial for my tastes. I wish it could have been a more traditional story with Cap fighting the Red Skull or Zemo, or any of his long time arch-foes. I was also hopeing that Rachel Leighton (Diamondback) who was once in love with Steve Rogers in the comics, would make an apperance, but she never did. Maybe in future Cap novels, and I hope Mark Waid gets the chance to write one of them."
3,Typical B Grade Beach reading,"This is brain candy, not art.Enjoy it for what it is. Try not to think too much about it."
2,Here's a CHEAPER way to get this:,"Two stars because it's overpriced from this seller.There are 2 ways to order this:The wrong way costs $24. The right way costs only $9.99.Most searches reveal the BG2020 part which costs 17.99 + 5.77 shipping since it comes from a company that doesn't do Amazon's Free Super Saver Shipping.I have the BG2020 model shaver, so I thought I needed THIS part. But they shipped me the BG2000 part which states right on the package that it works for the BG2020 model shaver...I tried it...works perfectly as promised.So to help you avoid my mistake, search for:""norelco bg2000 replacement""Choose the $9.99 BG2000 part with the FREE shipping logo (you need to bundle this purchase with some others to get over the $25 min. to qualify).You'll get the exact same part I got, but at a 60% discount."
2,Huge fish! Lacks instructional content,"If you're looking for a ""watch them catch 'em"" video, this is for you. They pull in some huge hogs out of spring creeks and it's always nice to see the Green River on display. However, if you're looking for in-depth instruction, this video does not go very deep at all. It is an enjoyable video, but I would consider it 80% big fish catching, 10% instruction, and 10% advertisement."
4,Enlightening!,"If you have ever thought ""I wonder what the mentally challenged high school- aged demographic thinks of the poltical climate in Cuba?"" then this is the album for you!However, it is not as hilarious as Special Songs from Special Kids and lacks the gems like ""Insects""."
1,Dreadful technical problems in this DVD set,"The original series is undeniably great entertainment, but these mis-mastered DVD's would be unacceptable even if done by an amateur. The fact that A&E is pressing the sets by the thousands is unconscionable. The 3rd and 4th episodes in disk 1, for instance, are mastered with offset fields such that they jitter and bob through the entire length. (episodes 1 and 2 are acceptable.) It is hard to advise even a fan of the series to waste their money on these sets. These are some of the worst mastered DVDs I have ever viewed in my life. Series 1 also contains gross technical issues. One can only deduce that A&E cares not a whit for the technical quality of their DVDs. If you can tape these from a TV or cable showing, you will have a far superior copy. It is sad. Not even suitable for viewing on a laptop computer."
3,poor sound,"The show was good but the sound quality is not so good. It fades as the show goes on, within a few minutes my volumn is up all the way and can barely make out what they say."
4,Upstairs Downstairs: The Second Season,"Here we are again at 165 Eaton Place, the home of the Bellamy family and their servants. This boxed set includes all thirteen episodes of the second season of Upstairs Downstairs. I give this a 4 rating because of the storylines involved. Elizabeth Bellamy Kirbridge almost steals the season, and one grows tired of her whining about her unhappiness. After going through an impotent husband, an illegitamate baby, a lover, and joining the suffragettes, no wonder she left for America between the end of this season and season three. Her exit gave James Bellamy more screen time. This is still a wonderful season, though. My personal favorite episodes are THE NEW MAN, MARRIED LOVE, A PAIR OF EXILES, YOUR OBEDIANT SERVANT, and THE WAGES OF SIN. First rate entertainment."
2,Wondeful series horribly mastered,"This is a disgrace!This is a wonderful and unique series in television history mastered so poorly as to be nearly unwatchable. The second episode of the first volume actually jitters for the entire 50 minute length. A major step down from the well done first season set.If you don't care about artifacting and display quality, by all means buy a copy. But if you were looking for an even mediocre visual quality presentation, skip it. I pray they don't screw up Season 3 this badly!!!!!! A&E Home video should be ashamed of themselves for peddling such a dreadful presentation."
2,"Great series, poor DVD","I love the series, but the DVD quality is really bad. I'm only on the 3rd of 4 disks and one episode was so bad I could only listen to the sound. Trying to watch the screen gave me a headache. The last episode I watched had large yellow bands across the screen. It was just like watching it on a bad color TV set back when the series was released. Since I also purchased the First season and thought the video quality on it was very good, this Second season is a particular disappointment. Stay away unless you are a hardcore fan who has to have it."
3,Great show...lousy DVD transfer,"A&E have done it again I'm afraid. Yet another Upstairs Downstairs DVD collection that has been sourced from dreadful master tapes. The color is all over the place and some episodes judder for their entire length.Some episodes are not too bad quality-wise, but there have to better copies of this show tucked away in a vault somewhere - surely. It would really be a shame if this is the best that remains of this timeless series."
5,Fabulous Classic TV,"When television was reaching for the stars this series which lasted 5 years was like a rocketship in the anals of entertainment. Thirty years later it is still totally absorbing, sophisticated, and fun to watch. It is a classic that my husband and I re-visited recently over a period of several months. If you missed Upstairs Downstairs in the '70's don't miss it now if you can help it. A combination of a British soap opera, classical drama and comedy, we got totally involved in the family upstairs, and the second family of servants, downstairs. It's a hoot."
2,DVD transfer unacceptable.,"Unfortunately some of the material included in this series is almost unwatchable due to very poor picture and sound transfer. This was not the case in the commercial video release of the same material or in the cable TV screening shown recently here in Australia. The first series DVD transfer was not excellent, but it was better than this. I'd love to know what the British DVD transfer (only series 1 to date) is like in comparison. UPDATE 2004: The Australian DVD release of Series 2 has excellent picture and sound."
5,great gift,This was the perfect gift for baby Greta. Especially since costumes were from Garbo's movies. A keepsake as well as a mini history lesson in cinema. All in quality condition too.
1,Overreaching,"One has a sneaking suspicion reading this volume that Hanson started with his conclusion first (that Greeks invented the so-called ""Western"" way of war which, according to Hanson, requires emphasis on ""decisive"" battles) and worked his way back. The ""uniqueness"" of the Western way of war remains unproven (proving it would require an analysis of methods of waging war by other civilizations), and moreover it is far from clear that Hanson's ""Western way of war"" has been actually waged by Western states."
4,Erroneous assumption,"The only thing I can add to most of the foregoing reviews is that, in spite of this book's careful analysis of developments in heavy infantry tactics in Greek warfare, I think the Assyrians have as much claim to the invention of heavy infantry assault as do the hoplite warriors of the Greek poleis. It could therefore be argued that if the Greeks invented disciplined heavy infantry tactics, then it was in fact a reinvention and I think it follows that this phenomenon has taken place several times since. I would still recommend this book highly for its valuable content and quite readable style."
4,Great Popcorn Popper,Great machine...pops all the kernels. Only drawback is the powerpop disks are hard to find. Needed to order them online.
5,Presto Popper,This is one of the best units I have ever used. The care of the powercups is a bit tricky but just let cool and wipe with a dry cloth and you will be fine. We love this unit because we have little mess and fresh popcorn instead of microwave popcorn in a bag which tastes nothing like the fresh popped corn. I love to add spicy salt to my oil before adding the popcorn which will lightly cover the popcorn to create your own unique tastes. I highly recommend this unit.
1,Worked very well when new - ruined my microwave 2 years later!,"When I first purchased this item it worked very well. It mad a great bowl of popcorn.After the unit was only two years old, I was popping popcorn in it and I heard a loud buzz coming from my microwave. I turned and saw a bright yellow glow coming from the microwave. It caught my microwave on fire!I examined the bowl and found that the base was melted on the underside!Do not purchase this item it is not safe and should be recalled. There was no warning at all on this item!"
1,This never happens to me!,"Normally I review items before I buy but I made an impulse purchase yesterday and bought this popper. It was great on the first round of popcorn...made me wonder how I ever lived without one! Perfect...no sure there were 10 unpopped kernels.Round 2: Nothing. No popping. But wait, what is that odd smell? Is it the popper? The corn overheating bc it's not popping? Took it out, removed that batch, but another in. Smell became even stronger.So I checked reviews and found that somehow this popper is killing microwaves. Didn't try anything further as I am a pretty positive person, so I assumed I got a dud of a popper and would just return it.This morning I tried to make bacon in the microwave...nothing. It comes on but doesn't cook. And it started making a loud buzzing noise.Obviously the majority has had great luck with this little gadget, but it fried my microwave, which is under 2 years old. Back to Walmart today to return it and buy a new microwave.Thanks Presto."
5,Does what it's supposed to-perfectly,"I have been using this unassuming little popper for a few years now, while barely noticing it. It's one of those kitchen tools that just does what it is supposed to do, time after time after time, which may not be jaw-dropping and spectacular--but sort of IS!I never pop with oil, because when used for dry-popping, it just requires a quick wipe-out with a paper towel before putting away, and the little cardboard concentrators stay clean and last longer. I melt butter in the MW to pour over the corn after popping. This works perfectly when I use it on my microwave's automatic ""popcorn"" setting. Pops quickly with few leftover kernels. Using premium popcorn, virtually NO leftover kernels. Pops up crisp and fresh-tasting, every bit as easily as a popping bag of MW popcorn would be, with no unwanted chemical flavors.I fall for a lot of kitchen gadgets, some get pushed to the back of the cupboard from lack of use. This one delivers, and is always close at hand."
5,Best snack accessory possible,"Until they make an automatic Chex Mix maker, this is the killer app in home snacks. (Even if they did make a Chex Mix maker, it would still be inferior just for health reasons) Dump a half cup of corn in, 3 minutes later you've got a ton of perfect non-oily popcorn. I believe you can use oil, but why bother? It comes out perfectly without. I use spray-on ""butter"" and popcorn salt (when I can find it), so it's a very tasty, healthy snack. Once in a while, I go nuts and pour on actual melted butter-- with a lot less guilt since I didn't cook with oil.Highly, highly recommended-- I actually came to this page just checking to see if they still made it in case our 10-year-old model gets damaged."
4,Great Popcorn a little pricey,"This appliance makes great popcorn and is easy to use. The only con is the paper power concentrator inserts. It is a little inconvenient to have to remove one prior to cleaning and then waiting for the unit to dry before putting it back. They are over priced in retail outlets and hard to find, keep a supply on hand."
4,Magic Popcorn,"Ok, so I was skeptical to say the least, but I have to tell you that this little gadget is by far the easiest, quickest way to make some really good popcorn. My wife and I have been having popcorn pretty much every night since we received it last week. I guess every microwave oven is different, but for us, it takes 1:30 to get the whole thing popped to perfection, though there are like 10 kernels left unpopped, I have found that if I leave it for longer than that, some of the popcorn tends to taste burned or something which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. As for the little disks that are needed, we have used 2 so far. The first one I used various combinations of oil, water (to get the salt to stick)hot sauce and what not and that disck only lasted like 8 uses, but the other disk has easily been used 15 or so times, and even though it looks dirty, its still working so results will vary. Overall though, a very, very wise choice."
2,Kind of a let-down from Presto,"I really like my other Presto products, a pressure cooker and the Pizzazz pizza cooker. But this thing is more of a gimmick than anything else. It does work pretty well, but is kind of a hassle to clean and store. Plus I need to remember to keep the little paper cooking disks in stock. I liked it OK at first, but now rarely use it. Microwave popcorn bags don't really cost that much more than the bulk popcorn plus the disks, and are much more convenient."
4,"Ok, so long as you have a newer microwave","Worked great until I moved and now the popper does not work so well. I blame the microwave in the new place more than the popper itself. Before, I had an overflowing bowl of propcorn in less than 2 and an half minutes."
1,Worst popcorn popper I've tried,"This silly item requires expensive ""concentrators"" that don't work particularly well, leaving behind plenty of unpopped kernels. Don't waste your money."
4,Signed by Orville Redenbacher?,"Signed by Orville Redenbacher? Huuum That would be a real trick since he drowned in 1995. Amazing what companys will stoop too just to sell us something. Better to say ""recommended by O.R.Company"" possibly? More truth to it,but what do marketing Companys care about that?Popper pops very well though. At least they did'nt lie about that for a change. Wish it had a permenant concentrator so we did'nt have to buy them. Only reason for 4 stars."
3,Having problem getting necessary components!,"This is a WONDERFUL product (SO much better than that bagged popcorn that you see everywhere)- but it requires the use of a ""Presto"" brand disposable cup in order to use it, & none of the stores where I live carry it anymore! And so far, I have not beeen able to find them online either! BUMMER! I'm about ready to just give up and toss it."
1,Microwave Popcorn Popper,"I ordered this popper for my daughter early in December and gave it to her for Christmas. Unfortunately, she didn't open the box until over a month had passed, and when she found that the bottom was cracked she attempted to exchange it, but was unable to because of Amazon's one month return policy. Too bad. When we shopped locally and bought one, she is thoroughly enjoying it."
2,Ok if you only want a little bit of popcorn,"This thing works ok, but doesn't make much at a time and the popcorn has a weird texture to it.. I much prefer my old air popper. I will be donating this microwave popper to Goodwill or Salvation Army and stick with my air popper"
3,Presto Popcorn Popper,"The popcorn popper works great, especially for those who pop without using butter or oil. HOWEVER, it was a big disappointment to find out that we had to replace the insert that makes the popcorn pop on regular basis. When you add the time to clean the popper, the detergent you use and the repeating extra costs for the insert, you do just as well to purchase the microwave ready bags instead."
1,my newer microwave quit too!!,"Yes,- I'm mad.- I thought the last fellow maybe just had a defective microwave or something....but multiples here now...something is wrong...this was a very nice Expensive Stainless Microwave only 7 months old. On the third batch in this popper...it just went DEAD. I wonder if it isn't a problem with the base or insert reflecting too much back to the magnatometer bulb. Hope this gets to you other consumers before you blow yours up too.-The whole idea that it uses an accentuator should have given me a clue!...I'll bet presto knows...they sound defensive in their manual....it tells you.....Hey....we've tried it in a lot of microwaves...but some might not work....let us know....(yeah...right!!)"
4,SUPERIOR POPCORN POPPER,"PRESTO 04830 is so easy to use just put into the microwave. I have bought 3 other poppers only to become dissatisfied with them. This one has NO electric cords and pops most all the kernels. The replaceable powercup curled up after the first use and is suppose to be good for up to 8 uses, although I have my doubts as the edges of it are already breaking up and curl in it leaves kernels UNDER it that are not popped. I consider it better than the others I unfortunately bought."
5,Pops better than dedicated microwave bags,"Do understand that how well this item works is related to your particular microwave, but in ours at work, it's awesome. It doesn't get EVERY kernel popped, but it gets more of them done than the microwave bags, and assuming you stop the microwave when the pops slow down, it NEVER burns them.We make it without oil in the popper. Then put fresh popcorn in a bowl, add healthy olive oil, maybe some soy sauce, garlic powder, chilli powder, whatever you want. Healthy, fast, easy. A giant container of popcorn from Costco lasts our workplace forever.If you love popcorn and can't make it on your stovetop, this is the way to go."
1,Destroyed my microwave oven one month after purchase,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this product. I chalked up the ones saying it ruined their microwave to possible miss use. But after I used it about 15 times it burnt out my newer Sears Kenmore microwave oven. I phoned Presto and they said they hadn't received many complaints and can not control how different microwave ovens react to their product. They said corn in small amounts can behave differently, probably due to moisture content. I was using Orville's popcorn, which should be high quality. I'm very disappointed and feel there should be warnings on the product box and in the instructions."
2,poorpopper,"Love the finished product but too many kernels are left un-popped. My measurements are according to specifications yet, at least one quarter of the kernels are left whole, uncooked."
2,$.50 cost per pop added by required refill parts,"Okay, my title is a little wonky. Couldn't figure out how to say it in one line, but if you buy this, it will work. It'll make plain ol' fashioned popcorn with no added oils in the microwave. That's the good part.That bad part is that it's not quite so apparent from the description that you're going to have to use the paper concentrators for every single popping. You can't change it out every 3 or 4 poppings, you're going to use 1 each and every time you pop. And they cost about $4.29 per 8, plus shipping. So if you've got Amazon prime and free shipping, you're still adding at least 50 cents cost to each batch of popcorn. Doesn't seem so economical after all, huh?Also, you can't just run to your local store and get more concentrators, so you'll have to think ahead or stock up. And God forbid they stop making them anymore, you'll have a useless hunk of plastic. I'm glad mine was a gift."
5,Popcorn popper,We have bought this popcorn popper as a gift. We already have one and really like it.
3,Might damage some microwave ovens,We've been running our Presto popcorn popper several times a week in a variety of microwave ovens for the past two or three years and have been happy with the results. However just two batches cooked in a relatively new Panasonic Model NN-S634WF microwave oven burned out the magnetron. I notice that other PowerPop reviewers with Panasonic microwave ovens had the same experience.
1,Can't believe there are good reviews,"After reading the good reviews we purchased this popper. WOW!! WAS THIS A DISAPPOINTMENT. The papers last maybe 4 times (if we're lucky) Forget using oil, spray etc of any sort. The papers are good for one time only. We have used several different brands of popcorn including the recommended one. And nothing makes a difference. We bought the unit at Wal-Mart and when we go back to buy more papers we find out they don't handle the paper for the popper. So if we want to continue to use it we have to order and pay a shipping cost. It's not worth the money or the bother. As far as the popcorn it pops fast and sometime it taste OK and sometime not. You would think they would come up with something better then paper liners or at least someone would come up with a better microwave popper. I can't believe that we are the only one that has had this problem.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNIT."
2,NOT the best microwave popcorn popper,"This is NOT the best microwave popcorn popper. We tried this at a friend's house after Christmas, I was raving about my own new popcorn popper (the NordicWare Microwave Microwave Popcorn Popper that WAS available on Amazon) and my buddy wanted to show me his popcorn popper, the Presto popper. (Such is the exciting life of younger married men with small children). He has to use a disposable base each time he uses the Presto Popper and the popcorn is not as good. Get the NordicWare instead, much better popcorn and it is just a well-designed piece of plastic with a lid, no gimmicky ""Concentrator"" baloney."
4,Pops Well,"Surprised at how light-weight the unit is, but it does a nice job of making microwave popcorn, with minimal fuss.Only concern is the durability of the fiber-board inserts, which are ""required"" for best results. Directions state they should last for 8-16 batches, depending on how much oil is used - but our first insert is looking pretty shabby after only 4 batches."
5,Easy and delicious,"I am a serious popcorn addict. The problem is that when buying microwave popcorn, there aren't many choices as to how healthy the contents will be, and if I pop a bag I will eat the entire bag. Huge pros for a popcorn popper are that I can decide for myself what to put in it and how much to pop at one time.My mom got this for me as a gift. She said she was skeptical because a lot of online reviews for various poppers said that none of them were really that great. I'm glad she risked it though, because I love this popper! I've used it several times already, and the popcorn has been perfect every time. This is probably one of my favorite gifts that I've ever received! I highly recommend it!"
2,This popper does not work in my microwave.,"As some others who have written reviews, I was only able to use each concentrator two times and then it was completely destroyed. I emailed Presto and received a prompt reply. I thought perhaps lowering the power setting would help but this is the message I received: ""I don't think lowering the power setting will solve the problem. The popper reacts differently with each microwave. I do have a different power base that I can send to you at no charge that usually gives you good popping performance and more uses from each concentrator. If you would like to try the alternate base, please provide your complete mailing address and we will send one to you."" I should get the new base next week and will give it a try and then write another review.NEW BASE RECEIVED AND IT DOES NOT WORK IN MY MICROWAVE. THE ITEM HAS BEEN RETURNED."
3,Replacement for old Presto popper,"My old Presto popper, which had given me excellent service for MANY years, at least 8, finally cracked on the bottom. The new one is made of much lighter material. After burning a couple of batches, I now cook in 80% power, which is working fine."
2,Not so great.,"I purchased this MW popper with high hopes of getting more popped kernels per batch, and the first use gave me hope: nearly every kernel was popped. Subsequent batches have gotten progressively worse, with up to 1/2 of the original kernels unpopped. I changed the liner after about 5 uses (the directions state that without oil it will last up to 20 bowls) and had a bit of luck with the first bowl again, but then the same rapid decline with more use. I'm quite disappointed with this product."
5,Presto PowerPop,"I purchased this popper as a gift for someone who did not like the taste of air popped popcorn and who wanted to control the amount of oil used. This popper is just wonderful. It makes the perfect amount for 2 people and the taste is just great. I also purchased flavorings (kettle corn, parm cheese, ranch and chili) and they added a great touch for something a little different than just salt. I ended up buying another one of these to be used as a Christmas gift because this one worked out so well."
1,Useless,"Wasted 2 cups of good popcorn trying to make this thing work (according to their instructions). No matter what I tried, it popped a minimum of the kernels and left the majority not popped and on the verge of burning. Cannot wait for it to dry so I can package it up send it back. I gave it one star in error - - it doesn't deserve any stars. For reference: I have a high power microwave so low power was not an issue."
5,Best microwave popper,"This is the best Microwave popper I have ever used. It pops almost every kernal. The bowl does not get too hot and you can put butter on afterwards or not. Better than the air popper. If you put butter on, place in another bowl so as to extend the use of your disc for the bottom."
4,Best Popper I Have Owned,"This popper is almost perfect. You do have to send away for the paper concentrators when you are running out, but it may be worth it since you get perfect popcorn each time. I would prefer a larger batch of popcorn, but this unit does do well when you immediately make additional batches with the unit already hot from the last one."
4,Had it for years but grew tired of having to find the trays.,"I've had this for years and it works well. The trays are becoming more difficult to find locally, WalMart doesn't even have them, so we ordered another brand that doesn't use them."
5,Works Great,Used this a couple times immediately after receiving. I used it with Coconut Oil and it made some of the best popcorn I've ever had. Will be using this very frequently.
5,Amazing. Perfect corn EVERY time,Love this product. It works great. Best popcorn I have ever eaten. It doesn't look like much but works perfect.
5,Works Great!,"I was going to get this other fancy looking popcorn popper but I read the reviews for it, and decided against it. I got this one instead because the reviews were so much better, and I'm very happy that I did. This is so easy to use, and works like magic!"
2,Disappointed about buying replacement concentrators,"I loved this popcorn popper, UNTIL I ran out of the concentrators that were provided with the popper. After looking at numerous stores to find the replacement concentrators, I realized that I was going to have to buy them online. Then, I realized that if I buy more concentrators, I am going to be paying almost what I payed to purchase the popcorn popper, just in replacement pieces and shipping and handling! I will be looking for another popcorn popper."
1,A lot of Issues,"I bought this based on all the reviews I read here. It is one of the most useless kitchen gadgets I own. Have been using it for a couple of weeks and have not yet managed to not have burnt popcorn. I have used 5 or 6 concentrator cups so far. Each one is a total burnt up mess after use. The directions say use 1/3 cup of popcorn and when it stops popping it is ready. Right!! By the time all that corn pops it is practically on fire. So I tried less corn, less time. Then all you get is a lot of old maids and still burnt. Next batch less corn, less time, much lower setting. Still slightly burnt, lots of unpopped kernals. Haven't been able to reuse a concentrator yet. This may work if you have a very low wattage microwave. I may try once more at about 40% power for a minute and see what I get. This thing is definitely a pain in the butt!"
4,better than expected,this popped almost all the popcorn in 2 min 45 seconds vs the microwave bags that took 3.5 minutes. i was surprised how well this worked with the power concentrator (available from manufacturer for only $1.53 pack of 8) and will be able to stop using the diactyl laden microwave popcorn bags!
4,Great Popcorn,"I bought this because I love popcorn and heard that this is an easy, cheap way to have it. With this popper, you have the option to use or not use oils and it makes about 10 cups of popcorn per batch. I've used this numerous times since I've bought it and have few complaints.The only downside that I can think of is that it comes with replaceable inserts that you have to use in order to use the popper. They inserts *are* reusable, but they do wear out after a few uses. So, it is NOT a one-time investment, but rather an on-going expense. This is not a huge drawback, but I do think it is something to consider. I think it's still cheaper than buying microwave popcorn, and much healthier, since you eat only what you add to the popcorn.All in all, I do not regret buying my popper. I put in 1/3 cup of kernels, 2 tablespoons of butter and the popcorn is just delicious. The kids love to use it, too."
5,My favorite corn popper,"This is a very simple popper that gets the job done. In my small microwave, it takes about 4 minutes for a load that lifts the top (I'm a four-quart person with a three-quart popper, so I put in a few more than the prescribed 1/3 cup). Since I use oil, the concentrators don't last as long as for dry popping (6 uses vs. about 30), but they are inexpensive and available from many sources on-line. The slits in the cover let the steam escape and give you crisp popcorn every time.I have used this popper for about eight years, and never once regretted it. I bought it because I wanted the convenience of microwave without the transfats that come with microwave popcorn. Those who say that the concentrators don't work or the popcorn tastes bad must be using inferior oil or microwave ovens made in Elbonia."
1,A great popcorn burner,"I've now made about half a dozen batches of popcorn in the PowerPop I got last week. I haven't found any way to use it that doesn't result in burnt corn. Even using low power levels and shorter times or removing it and shaking the popped corn every 30 seconds still results in some burning. The inserts get much too hot, much too quickly, and I noticed that there is some charred plastic in the bottom of the bowl.Used ""normally"" (e.g. 2 minutes on high), as I did for the first batch, my PowerPop produces a blackened, smoky mess."
1,Can't take the heat,"I bought this popper with high hopes. After carefully reading the instructions (2-5 minutes popping time, wait until popping slows to every 2-3 seconds) and the corn burned enough to ruin the paper insert. The next day I cut the power to 70% and it still burned after two minutes. I will say that I have a new microwave and it is extremely powerful. I suspect this popper just can't handle it. This is a return."
5,Who needs powercup concentrators anyway?,"Great microwave popper. I don't use the25 cent paper inserts, but instead use white cardstock of similar thickness (or construction paper)cutout in a 5"" circle.This pops about 80 to 90% as fast as the presto powercup concentrators. We use a couple tbsp of trans fatfree margarine instead of oil. Tastes great.If your Microwave has a rotating dish,then don't place your Powerpop in the center of themicrowave: you'll avoid burning a hotspot in the centerof your concentrators or substitutes.I'd like to see them build the same model out of clearpyrex or simax, but minus the paper concentrators.That would be a GREAT microwave popper."
3,"Of course, you will need refills of special parts ...","We needed to eliminate the high fat, high salt content of microwave popcorn but didn't want another counter-top appliance. The popper makes good popcorn, but you will need to find a source for the cardboard inserts (called concentrators) in your neighborhood ..."
3,concentator - only purpose is to be replaced,"It works well. But it need a cardboard insert called a ""concentrator."" As far as I can tell, the only purpose of concentrator is to be replaced. They could have simply molded the bottom of the bowl into a cup, but they didn't.You know how it goes: give away the shaver, make money on the razors; give away the printer, make money on the inkjet cartridges; give away the polaroid camera, make money on the film.Aside from the expense, these concentrators can be hard to find. It is a hassle keeping up with them."
1,the worst popcorn popper,"The cones you have to use fell apart after 2 tries, ended up in my popcorntied lowering time and temp. Plastic melted where cone contacted. Tried dry and with oil, oil was a disaster. I do not recommend."
5,The best pooper,"I just bought my second power popper. I had the first one for at least twelve years before something melted onto it making it unusable. If not for that, I'd have had it lot longer.I like it because you can make air popped corn, that is without oil. It's less greasy and less fattening that way. But you can use oil if that's what you want. I like this better than other types of air poppers,also, because it's not as messy."
5,the best!,"I've had my popper for YEARS...at least 15, maybe closer to 20. Still works great. Popcorn is my favorite snack, and I love that I can make an entire large bowl with only 1 teaspoon of oil, just the way I like it (hate air-popped corn). I'm a skilled cook and have no other microwave-cooking ""gadgets"", but I wouldn't be without this one. Buy it!"
2,Maybe I got a defective one????,Just returned this item to Walmart tonight. Had it for about one week. first two batches were good...tried to pop a third batch (same power setting and time as first two) When I removed the popper from microwave I noticed something black on the bottom of the microwave. The bottom of the popper actually melted.. So now looking for another brand..
5,High Quality,"Nothing more to add other than what others have said. As a lazy person who loves popcorn, this is a great product."
2,only so/so,"For the money I guess it's not that bad but I found the popcorn to come out tough and hard to chew. I've used Orville Reddenbacker kernals, which I think is a very good quality. After using it two weeks I'm now in the market for an electric air popper."
5,Our second of these,"Our first popper (exact same model) lasted a good 15-20 years - finally cracked - love it and happy we could find one on Amazon - however, the paper inserts that are sold for this product have declined in reliability - different review I guess - the popper is great!"
5,Everything I wanted,"I was replacing a popper I had had for 22 years so it was a hard act to follow, but it is performing well. I had my doubts about toe power cups, but they do seem to do their job. Overall good product."
4,Ecellent popcorn.,I got tired of microwave popcorn bags more and more of unpopped kennels. This goes into diswasher. I really wish it didn't have the pice that needs to replace but I don't use oil so I have only had to do that when I burned one batch.
5,AWESOME,"Wonderful!! Quick way to get popcorn...in my opinion, it beats the already prepared microwave popcorn hands down. Very happy I purchased it..."
4,Awesome...Except,Great Product..Popcorn taste great and you can season it however you like. The only thing I did not know is that you have to continue to buy these inserts in order to pop the popcorn!
3,cold popcorn straight from microwave,"I bought this popcorn popper after reading countless reviews on amazon, google, and gourmet websites. I have a 1600kW microwave and when using 4 Tbspn of safeway/walmart brand popcorn it takes me consistently 3:30 minutes. I don't add oil/butter directly to the pan and have resused 1 concentrator about 15 times. However even after the first use, burn marks appear on the concentrator and the concentrator develops an ""old popcorn"" smell. To avoid smelling up my house, I store the used concentrator in a zip lock bag, separate from the new concentrators. The popcorn is easy to use, not hot when removed from the microwave and very easy to clean. My only complaint is that even when removed immediately from the popper, the popcorn is only lukewarm and turns cold within a minute. Despite this I will continue to use it as this popcorn is still much better than toxic microwave popcorn, which I happily consumed for 20 years!"
4,gotta love it,the popper works just as they say. one thing to point out ( and the only down side) the power cup thingys that you put on the bottom dont last near as long as they say. they are cheap so its not a huge deal but does cut into the economy side of the popper
3,fat-free popcorn,"I eat a lot of popcorn everyday. I was using an airpopper. It left unpopped kennels. I was looking for an alternative. Thought this presto thing was it. Got it yesterday, tried it out last night. It does pop without oil or butter, but can easily burn if you don't watch it. I don't like disposible parts either, and you have to use the concentrator disk to make it work. An order form comes in the box to re-order the disks. It's OK for a back up, but my airpopper is quicker, pops more corn, and the kernels never burn. On the plus side for the Presto it is better than the pre-packaged micro-wave popcorn because you choose what to add to it."
1,Up in smoke!,The first time we popped corn with our new Presto Powerpop in our six month old Panasonic NN-S654BF microwave it popped only about 50% of the corn. We let things cool off as instructed and put in a second batch. BIG STINK! The microwave shut itself off. Looks like the magnetron is burned out. Was the microwave ready to blow? Are the products incompatible? I am giving no rating. Stay tuned.By the way. All those reviews here that complained about the Power Cup availability...they are available right here on Amazon.
2,not as good as the first one I owned,"I bought my first Presto Power Pop many, many years ago. I loved it. Finally, after so many years of use the plastic bowl developed cracks on the bottom. So I ordered a new one. The concentrator base on this new one scorches holes in the paper concentrators after only 2 uses ( with the old popper I could reuse about 12 times.)"
4,A great (not perfect) popper.,"I've had no problems with this popper when using 3 different microwaves - a stainless steel Panasonic Inverter Microwave, a high-powered GE Microwave, and a tiny (600 watt, I believe) microwave. Each of them worked fine and still work. No problems there.The popcorn always pops full and crisp and doesn't burn. If you happen to add too much oil, you can simply not use the bottom rung of popcorn, since it is liberally coated in the oil.Way better than microwave popcorn (less salt, no hydrogenated oils required, you can pronounce all the ingredients) and more flavorful than air popped corn."
5,best microwave popcorn popper!,We had a stove top Whirley pop corn popper that we loved. I ordered this one and we love it! This is all we use now.
4,"Great Popcorn Popper, Works As Advertised","I wanted to try out popping popcorn differently than buying the microwave bags of popcorn. I bought one of the air poppers that have the chute at the front, but that was a bust, as the kernels would bounce off the bowl onto the floor. Going back to the store that had the air popper I orignally bought, I found the Presto Microwave Popper. I've seen commericals for these many years ago, and didn't know they were still being made. Long story short, this popper works great, with most of the kernels popping (very good popped to unpopped ratio). The popper comes with these heating discs that go on the bottom of the popper before adding corn and oil. One disc will last between 12-24 batches of popcorn, depending on whether you use oil or not. The replacement discs I've found at Wal-Mart as well as the store that I bought the popper from. Very easy to clean, the base separates from the bowl, with the bowl and lid being dishwasher safe. Great product, 4 stars!!!"
2,microwave popper,"This didn't do as well as an old microwve poper I've used for yers. It didn't showa great increase in kernals popped,and they were not as light and crispy. It is absolutely necessary to use the 'power packs', which I couldn't find in local stores. Since I gave several of the poppers as gifts I shopped on line for replacement 'power packs' for all and found the postage/handling fee for 10 packages was ten times what it cost for one (incredibly light) pack."
4,Loving this popcorn popper,"I purchased this popper as a replacement to the glass microwave popper after that one broke. Have had it for about 2 weeks and am really liking it. Only drawback is you have to use a concentrator, which you have to replace after several uses. Trying to cut down on the amount of disposable items I use so not pleased at all with that. But, popper works great even without oil so I can control what goes in my food.Works fast and pops almost all the kernels."
4,Impressive,Not as good tasting as stove top popping but more than adequate & certainly as good as any air popper. Makes a generous portion in about 5 minutes with minimal cleanup. The concentrator inserts last for 24+/- batches and work fairly well. All in all when you're just not up for the work & cleanup of stove top popping this is a more than adequate substitute. I would have given it 5 stars if adding oil was as effective at raising the flavor profile as the instructions claim.
1,"Yes, burnt","I guess they must have changed the quality. I read the reviews, and bought it based on that. Some reviews mention price of the inserts! Who cares if it works as great as mentioned? It does not. I put in new inserts every time, and it burnt every time. Some people like burned popcorn. I do not. So in the garbage, and I will make it the old fashioned way."
1,Presto PowerPop failure,"I used my brand new Presto PowerPop for the first time last night. I followed directions to the ""t"". The first batch only half popped. We waited 15 minutes and tried again. This batch not only did not pop, but it blew out my 3 year old Panasonic Inverter Microwave. I would be afraid to try it in another microwave. Do not buy it!"
1,The worst & most dangerous popper that I've ever used,"There is not much to say about the Presto Power Pop other than that during my first use, it caught fire and melted in my microwave. I contacted Presto to let them know that their product caught fire and they expressed no concern or surprise about it and simply directed me to return the Power Pop to Amazon. I guess they are used to complaints about their products catching fire and melting. Very disappointing. That will be the last Presto product that I ever purchase.I will say that the the return and refund process through Amazon was super easy and I am very pleased with Amazon's customer service."
2,Not happy with performance,"I bought this based on a lot of enthusiastic reviews. Both my husband and I were very disappointed. We could never get the corn to pop thoroughly and the mess from the oil was a pain to clean. I know how to follow instructions and following them gave us either burned corn or many unpopped kernels.At the best, it was the equivalent of any microwave air popped corn - same as eating styrofoam. I don't want fake butter taste but to taste like anything, some oil needs to be involved so the sprinkle on ingredients like salt or flavoring will stick and not just fall to the bottom.The reason we tried this was because almost all the bagged corn now has transfat on the ingredient list. Very disappointing."
2,I wouldn't pay $25 for it...,"I received this as a Christmas present. I am a lover of popcorn and was making my own in a pot on the stove-top. I was excited to receive the microwave popper. However, it's a bit too complicated. I'm rather displeased that you need to buy paper ""power"" popping trays. I've attempted to make a dozen batches of popcorn in this thing, varying times and power levels and have only came out with 2 perfect bowls of popcorn. The other ten bowls were either burnt or barely popped. My friend has an old tupperware version (I don't believe they make it anymore) that is just a plastic bowl and vented cover that worked wonderfully, bowl after bowl. I am very disappointed with this popper, especially considering it's from Orville, I will be returning to my pan and stove."
5,"Useful, Durable","Holds lots of stuff, easier to access than lower-profile letter trays. Strong enough for catalogs. Good organizing tool."
3,Useful,This size will hold a whole ream of paper. I bought a few of them to stack and organize different types of printer paper and they work perfectly for that. Why are they so dang expensive?
4,A fun read.,"I got out of sequence and read the next book in the series first, but it was still an enjoyable read. The main character is like a doctor/detective in ancient rome, and is a sympathetic and engaging character."
1,Completely Unsatisfied with Product,"I was completely unsatisfied with the quality of this product. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my husband, but after I saw the shoddy quality of the product, I returned it instead. The product cost $37.99; shipping was $10.96, and return shipping was $12. I was only refunded the price of the jacket, $37.99, which meant that I spent $22.96 for shipping back and forth a product that did not measure up in any way to my expectations. I'll never do this again!Safari Outback Jacket with Zip-Off Sleeves (shown without sleeves)"
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this.I've read Software Requirements Best Practices and Mastering the REquirements Process, and they are both much, much better than this document.I found it of only limited use. If you were to use this standard as your requirements template, you would have to modify it fairly extensively.I personally like the Volere Templatemore than this template."
2,Minerva Necklace,"The coin is very nice, but the chain is entirely too ""fine"" to support such a heavy piece. In fact, I have never been able to hook the clasp because it is too small. If you buy this, plan to buy a new chain for it."
4,Great coin bad chain,"The only reason I am giving this four stars is because of the chain, the coin itself it great, I love it. It is the perfect size and goes well with all of my outfits. The chain however broke fairly quickly- thankfully it broke when I was at home and I did not lose the coin. If you buy this you should replace the chain right after you get it."
3,good,the necklace got me a lot of complements and questions if it was a real coin. i like it but just grew out of it after a while.
4,Great music!,If you prefer a Greek sound for belly dancing music this is a terrific CD. I use it quite a bit in my workouts and have found it quite enjoyable.
5,Heavy Metal is alive and well...,"To say that this CD delivers on all 12 cylinders is an understatement. Beyond Good and Evil is a fresh redefining of what true hard rock was 25 years ago and, thankfully, is once again now. This CD is not for the power-chord timid. Nor is it for those listening on weak, underpowered stereo systems. We're talking pure, high octane rock in its undiluted, nothing held back form. A true comeback masterpiece for The Cult. I'm just glad this is a CD and not vinyl, because it would be worn out by now!"
5,"The Cult Is Back With The Marshall Stacks On ""11""...","The Cult...I mean ""Thee"" Cult is back with the passion that soaked thru on the ""Love"", ""Electric"" & ""Sonic Temple"" albums. This album really sounds like a composite of those 3 releases; and, might be the Cult's best album yet. All lovers of metal can truely rejoice again. Billy Duffy might not be David Mustaine or Eddie Van Halen, but his playing brings back the melodic shredding of 70's guitarists such as Mick Ralphs, Ted Nugent, Ronnie Montrose and Ritchie Blackmore!! Believe it when Lamf77 says this album will not disappoint.Rise!!"
4,Very Good and Very Heavy!,"This is a very good album from a band that knows how to play the heavy stuff. There are a couple of songs (Nico among them) that can be skipped over, but one listen to Rise is worth the purchase."
5,Rock Solid,"This is the best recording to date from The Cult. The guitar is the best we have seen since the early days of The Cult. Billy has come into a new level with his Gretch White Falcon and the result is stunning.Ian has come back from his solo project with a new style that is a mix of late 80's early 90's Cult and Death Cult days. With Matt Sorum back on the drums you hear that they are back and better than ever.I have been a Cult fan since the days for Southern Death Cult and can say with out any reservations that this is their best album to date. It sent shivers up my spine and brought a tear to my eye to hear this great band again with songs like Ashes and Ghosts, Nico and American Gothic.This album is a far cry from what Ian did on his solo journey.If you like the Cult just a little but you owe it to yourself to buy this album. You will not be sorry."
4,Cult Returns,"The Cult are one of the more underappreciated rock bands from the 80's. They consistently made quality albums that were not groundbreaking but were good music. They lagged a bit in the 90's, but for their first album of original material in seven years, they have recorded an album that compares with their 80's work. Ian Astbury has a classic rock voice and he uses it to great effect on strong cuts like ""War"", ""True Believers"", ""Rise"" and ""Breathe"". The album has a dark sound to it especially on brooding tracks like ""Ashes & Ghosts"", ""Black California"" and the album's best track ""American Gothic"". Beyond Good & Evil is a welcomed returned from the rockers."
5,Now this is rock!,"This is one of the best rock albums I ever heard, and will certainly be for many years to come. The Cult make an impressive, earth-shattering, sound. The lyrics are fabulous. What more can I say? Get it now!!"
3,not like old times,"At first I really liked this album, but after a while I realized that this is not what I used to like about the Cult. The songs do not feel like they are a part of larger whole, like a thread running through the album, like on Love or Electric. I also have some minor objections on their attempt to fit in the ""new scene"" with booming drums and hard riffs. Despite this, there are some songs that make the album worthwhile, including American Gothic and Rise. But for you folks that was hoping for a new Electric or Love album have to keep looking. Maybe look at the Rare Cult album -- some of the tunes from Rare Cult could easily have been strong tracks on the aforementioned recordings."
3,THE CULT KICKS ASS,IVE ONLY HARD A FEW CULT ALBUMS BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DONE UNTIL THEY MADE THE ULTIMANTE CULT ALBUM CALLED BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL ITS A ROCKER FROM START TO FINISH I LIKE WAR THE PROCESS ITS A POWERHOUSE SONG YOU HAVE TO HEAR IT IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY
5,Perfect blend of old and new. A must have!,"From the days of Theatre of Hate, Southern Death Cult, and the Death Cult, to this magificent creation of raw passion, power, and attitude. Cult fans have waited 10 years for an album that could live up to their amazing history; and Ian and Billy have delivered! There are hints of vintage Cult lurking under strong, perfectly balanced, hard-hitting, and unique new songs. I thank them for doing what they do best - giving us something that truly rocks!!"
4,The time was right,"For some very unpretentuos music from the heart. The lyrics are sometimes dark and always full of feeling (what else from this band would you expect!?) and the music is like a 2x4 upside the head. I was scared the cult may try and capture a previous sound, but they came out of a half decade plus hiatus with a ton of straight up rock. I have listened to the album 30 times now and can't find one song i really don't like. Its sad to find out that they have once again gone on to other things - the Ian/Billy combo has always been a bit conflicting. Perhaps a different producer will lead them down a path that lasts next time. This album is a must for any fans of honest music..."
5,Rock and Roll Masterpiece,"This summer I went to a Cult concert. I have been a Cult fan since I heard Sonic Temple. I was on the front row and I anticipated a great show. I was totally blown away from start to finish! I have never been rocked that hard in my life. I actually cried. I bought Beyond Good and Evil shortly after that. I was immediately hooked. After the events of September 11, I played this album again and I heard it in a different way. Many of the songs seemed to relate to what was going on in the world. ""War"", ""Breathe"", ""American Gothic"", ""Ashes and Ghosts"", and ""True Believers"" all reflect the state of the world. This is the most important album of 2001. It's a must for any rock music lover. It is incredibly moving."
3,Heavy Stuff,"If you are looking for Electric and Love era Cult you better go elsewhere. This album is very heavy and nothing like the earlier stuff. Having seen the Cult's live show recently, which was excellent, I would say that this album comes on even stronger than the live show. The live show has the ""Electric"" sound, even on the songs they play from this new album. It's still a decent album though. Just listen before you buy."
3,Do Call It A Comeback,"Ian Astbury(vocals)and Billy Duffy(guitar) try to revive The Cult for the 21 century by tuning down and cranking up the volume. Amazingly enough, it's the leather lunged Astbury who doesn't always hold up his end of the bargain. On songs like ""American Gothic"" and ""Shape The Sky"" the band sounds like it's crossing their earlier ""Love"" album with ""Sonic Temple""(their most successful). This, along with the pounding ""Rise"" is what has made them different from whatever era was going on. They manage to blend hard Zeppelin riffs with modern psychedelia. On songs like ""The Saint"" though, Astbury should've spent a little more time on the lyrics; as he sings ""play the guitar, all tuned down""). The band though, sounds re-energized. If only they could do it for an entire record."
4,The Cult - Beyond Good and Evil,"I think I own every CD The Cult ever made. This is a good album, and I would recommend it."
2,"Wall of noise, shapeless songs","Both when it came out and now I hear some of the same baffling comments about this being a comeback, an important chapter in rock even sometimes. I gave it many chances then, and then now decided to give it another try. Whether or not some of this style was new for The Cult, it was nothing different from the sounds of the 90s metal and alt rock era. It was tired, very bland, boring, and tried to make up for that by being extra energetic and using a noisy harsh production. People for a long time now seem to think if it blares out of your speakers that they have a hard rock masterpiece. There's not a single memorable song here (being catchy is not memorable) and I have no wish to dilute my standards by being kind to their efforts here."
4,Good solid album,"Is this Love, Electric, or Sonic Temple? No. What it is is a good solid album w/a lot of very strong songs. If you're a Cult fan this album is worth every cent. If your not, wtf is wrong with you? Enjoy"
5,cult - beyond good and evil,The Cult has always delivered killer rock. Beyond Good and Evil is no exception.
3,Waiting for Brownlow and Gill,"I had been waiting for Kevin Brownlow and David Gill to get to Chaney. After all they have done the best work on the other geniuses of the silent era, it seemed only natural that they would tackle the premier actor of the time. Unfortunately it doesn't look like it's going to happen. Instead we are left with this mish-mosh which is little more than excerpts from the Kino catalogue slapped together with no rhyme or reason and annoying narrative full of fatuous pseudo-psychological insights with no apparent research to back them up.The lone bright spot is the appearance of very rare footage of Chaney off-camera. Too bad it couldn't have found a better home."
5,It calmed me down,"I was feeling so nervous before my exams at college. It would be a normal feeling if it was not for the physical reactions. 15 minutes before my test I would start feeling so cold. I was the only one wearing a thick jacket in class. My jaw and my hands would shake and my heart would start beating really fast.I researched online, I saw many products and I read many reviews. I am familiar with passion fruit. I mom used to make juice from it to make me call and it always worked. So I decided to try the passion flower extract.Unbelievable! I did not feel any of the physical reactions I just described. I was afraid to end up feeling sleepy but that never happened. I slept at the same time as usual but for my surprise I slept good and I was more rested on the next day.This product is amazing and I really recommend it. I took it only on the day of my test because usually I am a calm person but I would take it if I was a tense person on daily basis."
1,Allergic reaction.,"I have tried this twice and each time it made my throat itch and tingle and started having trouble breathing. It also made me so ""trippy"" that it gave me extreme anxiety- the very problem I was taking it to ease in the first place."
1,Passionflower full glass bottle broke after falling on hotel's bathroom floor,It's expensive but the taste is pallatible unlike other products like the Adrenal extract which is very hot like Cayenne pepper.The Passionflower 4 oz full glass bottle broke after it fell on the hotel's bathroom floor when vacationing last week! Plastic is better.I have no way to determine whether or not it is beneficial since I only took it for two weeks without a baseline or clinical testing for improvemnet.The supplement was recommended by a friend who told me that the passionflower extract would help to prevent testosterone from converting to estrogen inside the body.Is there any scientific research that corrobortates this claim or is it an inference based on theory or is it simply an urban legend that it helps maintain a man's testosterone levels with age?
4,Works pretty good for me.,"Wanted off a benzo, but wanted something to help with my anxiety related issues. This works enough to give me a calm feeling when I need it. Don't buy this expecting to get a buzz, it ain't happening. But, for what it's purpose is, it does a pretty good job."
4,Decent,"Made me sleepy during the day and had little effects on hampering my anxiety. I give it 4 stars because it is an AMAZING sleep aid. Also, every night I take it I have crazy dreams"
3,For extreme anxiety its not good enough,"I have extreme anxiety daily where I'm unable to concentrate at work a lot of times due to it and I have issues like concentrating too much on my breathing and really strange things. This product really doesn't help me or at least this bottle didn't. It didn't last long either if you take 40 drops 5 x's a day. I think the grain alcohol used to make the tincture is what relaxed me if at all. I may or may not give this another try. I really am looking for something natural that works like xanax, ativan or valium. Those are the only things that really make my anxiety disappear in the worst of situations but those meds, even though they are the greatest thing for anxiety, are also very harmful and I keep having to go to my doctor to get refills which is inconvenient.These tinctures also make my eyes feel a little heavy and I probably look tired - again I think its the grain alcohol."
5,Easy relaxation,"Not the best tasting stuff in water, but pretty good in soda or juice. One dropper full helps take the edge off."
2,Not effectivene for the price,"I've been taking passion flower by capsule for a while from a local heath food supplier. so I decided to give this product a try, sure it worked but I really needed 2 recommended doses to feel anything. It ran out really quickly. As I remember the product is like 40% alcohol, even with that little ""kick"" it wasn't really that effective."
3,Natural Supplement,"Purchased to help handle high anxiety. I have not personally felt any difference, however, I think this is a product you must take over a long period of time."
5,Dark Electronic Music,"i bought this CD late '97 and been looking to buy a copy since someone never returned mine back in 98. . FINALLY. i have to agree with the first reviewer, this album is a work of art. i also want MODUS OPERANDI, another of theirs. for some reason these are rare albums to get a hold of."
5,"Unbelievable, moving, inspirational, incredible.","My first exposure to Symbiosis was a 12"" LP that was out of print and heavily played. Amazingly, 2 years later I come across this, their full LP!The best way to describe these guys is: Ambient, Deep Jungle, Hard Trance, Spacey break-beat and Trancey down-tempo. Seem like a crazy mix? It is, and they pull it off with amazing beauty and elegance.This is, by far, my favorite CD of all time. It is still in my heavy rotation list, after 3 years!The entire cd flows from song to song (like a mix cd) but within their own control and style. Its almost impossible to tell where one song ends and another begins.This is ""journey"" music. If you need something to help you sort out reality... this is the cd for you!"
1,Disappointed,"Disappointed in abunda trade; sad to say I never received my Symbiosis cd. I gave them ample time but still was a no show. Not sure what happen, but the bottom line is I never receive the product I was intended to receive."
5,Connected to the Work,As you might imagine and the title implies this is a wonderful introduction to the work of the Eames' design office. More importantly it is a warm fun filled story of two wonderful and creative human beings who truly sought to make a difference in the world by living with integrity. I feel they succeeded and I think that anyone who reads this little gem will begin to see the connections that weave all life's little mysteries into a comprehensive story .
5,A Great Couple of Designers,"Charles and Ray Eames' lives are documented by their grandson in this fascinating collection of anecdotes, photographs, and excerpts. If you know only a little about this creative couple - their chairs, perhaps, or the House of Cards - read this book to hear about their work with IBM, the government of India, and the Nobel Prize Committee. They have touched al of our lives in some way, making design accessible to the masses, and this book tells their story very well."
3,Chain Saw Carving The Bear,Good content but poorly recorded. Half the time you can't tell what the saw operator is doing.
1,Not worth the money,"The production of this video is terribly amateurish. Terrible lighting no detail available. Finally half way through the video they find the zoom lens. No description of products, no explanation of tool.Most of the chain saw use is with the person's back to the camera."
3,descontento,el rotor queda bailando en el eje del distribuidor y hay que colocarle papel para que ajuste porque sino queda brincando y el motor no anda.
2,"Disappointing after ""Gateway"" and ""Beyond...""","I returned to read the gateway trilogy after a 15-year absense (!) and I found this one to be the most disappointing. Gone is the sense of mystery and struggle, in this third book Robinette seems like an annoying Richie Rich character surrounded by exotic Heechee toys and and annoying friends and helpers dredged up the first two books in the series plus a few new ones. Klara even makes a comeback, but it's disjointed, unbelievable and emotionless. Pointless, even; I'd say Robinettes longing and guilt for Klara is best left unresolved. I recommend Gateway (the best) and Beyond the Blue Event Horizon (quite interesting, especially when you figure out what the artifact is and its history), but then stop it there because this book is pretty much a loser."
3,help!!,"hello,is there anyone know how to update the rio 600 player that could play the files with .rm?"
2,If you like colors...,"This is obviously not a vital accessory for the Rio 600. Personally, I would not buy it but if you are that determined to change the color of the Rio then go ahead. I say this because I think it is a waste of money to buy this just so you can mix and match colors."
3,Amazon ships the wrong product!,"If you order the AeroBed Premier Comfort Quilt bed make sure that is what you actually receive. I received the AeroBed Premier Classic, which is a less expensive AeroBed. And when I sent Premier Classic back for replacement I recieved the same thing again. There is obviously a problem with Amazon's inventory. Be careful!"
1,Forestera,Unfortunately the Amazon site did not state that this book was in a language other than English.
3,Simpler than hoped -- but good effort,"This is more of a pamphlet than a ""book"" -- it's simply printed and written for the novice in mind. But, there IS some good data, so I'm glad I added it to my collection."
3,Series already in decline; Bad packaging,"I am a great fan of the Animaniacs, but watched them only as reruns, so I had no sense of the episode order. Watching the episodes on DVD, I found that the second season was a noticeable decline from the (brilliant) first season. Plenty of great segments, but enough mediocre/bad segments that you are likely to want to just skip over.Packaging: Discs 1 and 3 are extremely difficult to extract (assessment by multiple people). The center button doesn't release the disk and the finger indentations intended to let you grasp the edges of the disc have a rim that prevents you from doing this. Friends have encountered this non-functional design in packaging of other DVD sets. This failing is significant enough to be a one-star demerit."
3,Funny show - lame transfers,"Well we've enjoyed the shows, the folks at Warners dropped the ball on transfer quailty. The prints are dirty in places. And sometimes you get these odd ghost images during motion. For a show that's barely a decade old, it looks ancient."
3,Very entertaining,I love the animaniacs but disk 3 and 4 dont want to play right this seems to happy with all the vols
2,"Good but far, far away from the REAL THING...","First of all it's very good to have so many Hitchcock's film music on just two CDs. A very good idea for a remarkable album. Unfortunately these are not the original scores, but a rerecording by Paul Bateman and the City of Prague Philarmonic. That's where the problem is. While some of the rerecordings are very good (Vertigo) others are a real shame (Rear Window and North by Northwest). Unfortunately (again) most of the films here presented are not available on their original recordings (like Rear Window or Psycho - two of my favourites). So, this is the only way you'll probably get them all together. I just wish we could have the REAL recordings! Anyway, a good buy (but far from great)..."
4,Great Color Photos,"This book contains numerous good photos of the Lennon family from the late 1970's. Primary locations featured are Hong Kong, Japan and New York City. John, Yoko and Sean are photographed in numerous nature scenes in Japan. John and Sean are pictured swimming together. Zoo visits, picnics and bicycle riding are also featured. In NYC John and Julian are shown sledding together in Central Park. Also, there are pictures from a birthday party in NYC for John and Sean. Overall, this book provides various intimate shots of the Lennon family at leisure."
2,"Too wordy, not enough visuals","I was excited about the topic of this book, because I am a graphic designer and I am called upon to design invitations from time to time. However, I was a little disappointed with the content of this book. It did give a thorough background of the printed wedding invitation, written information about each possible invitation component, and some helpful pointers for a bride. However, there were very few photos and the images provided were fairly basic invitations - not very imaginative. If I had flipped through this book in the bookstore, I doubt I would have spent the money."
2,Not that great,"The book is pretty and has a bit of useful information, but definitely not what I was looking for. You can get most of the information on the internet anyway. Save your money."
1,Pretty but useless,"It looks cute (like Martha Stewart's magazines) but did not contain one usefull piece of advice. Since most of us only do this once, there is not too much personal experience to draw from. Therefore we look to the professionals for ideas, sample wording and help.This was total waste of time unless I was going to have each invitation hand written or tied with a rhinestone buckle."
3,"Good breadth capture and article selection, lacks refs","To me, a good introductory book should cover a broad range of topics in a wholistic manner, have consise but immediately useful information, and provide a set of next places to go for further education. This book is great at the first one, covering all of the topics I would expect to see in this area. Quality varies among the articles on how immediately useful they are; some are more in the area of ""we did a study and you can classify people these ways"" than the ""be ready to identify situations of these kinds, as if you act this way by default, your reaction will get you into trouble."" The lack of references is actually the biggest problem; a few of the abbreviated articles refer to some further learning, but many miss out on immediate next steps for people who want to learn more."
4,Loved the Movie Love the Album,"I have bought so many CD's and sountracks and been disappointed, but I am happy to say this isn't one of them. I have had it for about a week and have thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the instrumental first cut on the album, Pool of Freedom, the theme from the movie, and wish it was longer. With tunes like These Boots are Made for Walking, One Mint Julep and Lucille, this album covers a range of musical styles and if you have seen the movie, it brings back some of the scenes vividly. However, if you haven't seen the movie, I think it is still an album you can enjoy."
1,False Advertising,"I based my purchase of this book on the Editorial and Customer Reviews. What they failed to note is that despite the title, little of this is true macro photography - some of it is done with a closeup filter, but not much. Further, and in my opinion worse, is the lack of mention of the fact that most of the digital alteration in Photoshop is done with third party (read commercial and expensive) plug-ins. Sure, the author prefaces this by saying that you can try to get the same effect without them, but just try it - can't be done with most of the photos, therefore making this book worthless in terms of a tutorial unless you spend hundreds of dollars on Nik, KPT, etc plug-ins. I am returning the book. It's my most disappointing Amazon purchase ever!"
5,Perfect Conclusion to a Fine Trilogy,"KRITZER TIME is the third and final book in Bruce Kimmel's ""Benjamin Kritzer Trilogy,"" a highly entertaining, thinly-disguised account of the author's life through his high school years.Whereas the first two books, BENJAMIN KRITZER and KRITZERLAND, emphasized the humorous aspects of the subject's often bizarre childhood, this last installment is more serious.On the positive side, Benjamin makes up his mind that he wants a life in show business, to become an American Anthony Newley. Yet, there is also a sense of loss, as his family moves away from the house in which he grew up, and, tragically, the brutal murder (still unsolved) of an aspiring young actress, his closest friend.KRITZER TIME is a book that will make you smile and also cry. It's the perfect conclusion to a fine trilogy."
2,C-r-a-p,"If you plan to use it for anything but traveling with, don't waste your money.It's poorly designed and made. The flap facing you goes slamming down each time you open the top. I bought this thing as a present for my wife thinking that I'm getting her something nice (more expensive than an average jewelry box) and instead I was embarrassed because it turned out to be such a piece of crap."
2,Returned item -,We returned the jewelry box because it seemed more like a travel jewelry box and not the type that we were looking for. It was nice and of good quality. Also found out my granddaughter hates pink! Who knew!
3,"This is getting silly, guys","I think I made a mistake in recommending this guide over at BookThink - and have inadvertently been responsible for driving up the price to obscene levels. The truth: this guide is ok in that it provides (via price comparison) some knowledge of what's hot in the romance market and what's not. But it ain't $100 or more ok. It ain't even $10 ok. Shortly before we installed a purchase link on our website, I paid about $4 for a copy. _That_ was ok. Barely. I urge you not to pay a king's ransom for this book. A few hours spent studying eBay closed auctions will net you more than this thing will, and your information will be up to date as well."
1,Shockingly poor printing ..,"Save your money. The typefont in this book is so small you will need a magnifying glass to read it. I am surprised at the publishers -- atrocious job !! Amazon should take this off their site in my opinion.Try ""Extractive Metallurgy of Rare Earths"" by Krishnamurthy and Gupta -- much more expensive and a bit dated -- but it is good an you can read it !!"
1,Not as good as I hoped.,"I was expecting touching stories of the type of the ""chicken soup"" series. This one just wasn't emotionally moving or really all that inspiring. Most of the stories are read-able, but lack heart. Don't mistake it for Christian reading, either. In one of these ""chocolates"" they depict God in a manner that I didn't agree with, which did honestly earn them a lower score on the review. I appreciate the effort that was put into the book and the writer relaying the stories did use good grammer in her writing. The stories were just dry."
2,original?,the remake was betterthe nudity was tastefulno pun intendedcareful evaluation concludes this could have beena somewhat distasteful movie
5,The Meaning of Life,"This is a wise and compassionate guidebook that addresses a wide variety of spiritual questions, that anyone, whatever their spiritual path or religion, will find of value. With a spirit of tolerance, clear-cut solid advice, and a subtle dose of whimsey, Tom Gregory shows us not only how to infuse life with meaning, but how to create a better world."
5,Great Job! Well Thought out Book.,"The all inclusive Life's Meaning and Purpose manual. It is a well thought-out book with rich, deep content. If you agree with the author...all life's answers are here. Who we are, why we are here, how to prosper in all areas of your life, and seems to prove his point with every page. I am a believer."
2,Picture looks better than actual product.,"I ordered 20 glasses, and 4 arrived broken. Amazon issued refund. The picture looks classier than actual product. In person looks and feels like you paid a dollar each. So not bad if you get it for that $1 price."
3,Okay for $4.30 but arrives broken,"When I ordered this the first time, 1 arrived broken. It was because the packaging inside the box itself is flimsy and they don't pad the glass. I don't know why amazon doesn't look inside and add more padding next to the glasses itself as shippers tend to be rough with packages. It didn't even have a red fragile sticker on the outside. I asked for a replacement and the next time none were broken for this glass, but the other shipment in the collection was. See my other review. So if you are willing to risk at least 2 shipments to get a full set of four, order it.The glasses themselves are ok for $1 and change a piece. They arent't the thickest walled but better than cheap Ikea ones. However is you look at flea markets for Libby glasses, they are much thicker and can be had for less than $.50 a piece. And they won't arrive on your doorstep broken."
3,A Tangled Web,"Twelve years ago, Diana's young heart was broken when her stern father broke up her illicit romance with a common man, Tom Cole. She went on with life, marrying well and becoming a young widow, but never forgot Tom. Now, he has returned to her life, as wealthy American guest at one of her friend's house parties. However, before they can have a second chance, the two will have to navigate through a sea of matchmaking plots and counterplots. By the time who is to be with whom is sorted out, there might be a happily ever after in there for at least one or two couples.*** This delightful comedy will bring a smile to your face. Diana moves from being a shy girl to a lady of dignity without losing her sparkle. This is a very positive book that will please fans of the genre well. ***Amanda Killgore"
4,Destined for a Lifetime Movie,"Saw this book in the library - it was the clever title and jacket art that caught my eye and aroused my curiosity. I checked it out and was rewarded with an honest, poignant, and inspiring account of love the second time around and surviving heart disease. If you enjoy reading Ruth Rheichls memoirs, then this should delight you."
3,packs a punch.......,"i have 2 of these installed to a 4000 watt amp and so far they have held up. these things are some monsters, make sure you have a box made out of .75 mdf with supports inside. cause if you dont these subs will rattle the box to peices!! i will have video and pics up soon. great for the price and great for the sound...."
4,good sub,l must say not every one nose how to connect a sound system.i buy two of these subwoofers an my god they are great.I ofto plug my hear. Not 1600 Watt about 400 -500watt.good for the money.
2,pure over rated junk.,well i traded for a set of these about a month ago and was not pleased with them they were never over powered before i got them there were on a 400 watt dual amp so i figured i would see if they would handle some power I've got a older Sony Xplod 1200 watt amp and bridge it because these are supposed to be 1600 watt they are way off i had the amp half on the gain with both voice coils active and could not get to 25 on my pioneer head unit with out them smoking and it goes to like 45 or so.
2,not worth it,"These speakers are not worth your time or money. I bought 2 of them with the lanzar max pro 4000 watt amp. The subs were broken in with care and they sounded really good for a while but I ended up with a blown sub about one month later. If you are in the market for subs save your money for something better then these. I now have 2 jl audio w6s with 2 jl audio 1000/1v2 amps and I couldn't be happier... as for lanzar, complete garbage."
1,not even worth the shipping to get them repaired,blown these subs the same night i got them using an amp that only puts out 1200 watts at 1 ohm. supposedly the speakers handle 1600 each so thats sum bull. DONT BUY
2,disappointed,"My family received this game as a gift. The 12 year old in our family had a hard time answering the questions, even though we consider ourselves to be a well-read family. We had to specifically look for cards about Children's Books for her. While it says that 2 or more can play the game, it would be impossible given the rules of the game for 2 people to play. Much of the game depends on the first person to identify the book yet passing the clues to the ""person on the left"" creates logistical difficulties. We will have to greatly modify the rules in order to play this game again, or we may just save it for the next garage sale."
4,A fun board game for medium group; however...,"We adults enjoyed the interaction of playing the game; however, we found errors in the information. For example, one of the clues to the author of ""Paddington Bear"" made reference to a bone, and to top that the author's identity was given as Michael Bone! Wrong! Michael BOND wrote the Paddington Bear series. Also, the description of ""Little Women"" placed the setting in rural England. Wrong! It was Northeastern US. Disappointing editorial control. We will probably play it again, however. We now have a double challenge of guessing the right answer AND looking for more errors."
2,"I wanted to love this game, but...","I wanted to love this game, but I just couldn't get past the fact that there is no way to use the cards to quiz yourself.Half the fun of Trivial Pursuit is reading the questions, guessing the answer, then flipping the card over to see how you did.That's not possible here, as all of the cards have the answers written on the same side as the question, and most of the cards have those answers written in such a way that they cannot be covered up to satisfy the whims of obsessive self-quizzers like me.Of course, if your child doesn't have a self-quiz fixation, s/he might love this game.And the idea is a fine one. I'm hoping there will be another version. I'd love to see an adult version of this, aimed right at the NY Times Crossword set..."
3,Bookology,"We have found an error in the first game we have played and I don't know yet if there are more. But famous lines from ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" by T.S. Eliot were identified as being from ""Portrait of a Lady."""
5,I Want More!,"I have good news and bad news regarding this game. The good news is that it is a blast to play, especially if you love books and enjoy belittling your friends with your knowledge. The bad news is that there are only 240 clue cards, or ""book questions"" upon which the game depends. I have owned this game for four days now, and my friends and I have already gone through each of the clue cards, nullifying play until expansion packs become available (if they ever do). Also, the box claims that it can be played by two or more people, although it does not supply the rules for a two person game (a friend and I had to make up our own.) Overall,the game was great while it lasted. If players are able to pace themselves, the game is sure to supply plenty of fun and healthy competition."
2,Not really for 2 players,"Even though the games says it can be played with only 2 players, there are no rules to support it. The rules as given, cannot be used with only 2 players. Given this short fall, we did manage to create our own rules that seem work.The question cards were good and cover both easy and hard topics -- however, I can quickly see the need for additional card packs if this game is played regularly."
5,one of the greatest albums ever made,"This is glorious -- some sort of wild mixture of Brian Wilson, Steve Reich, the Band, the Beach Boys, and a distinctly 90s sensibility. Created for 4000 pounds sterling, it is an absolute whirl of different influences, transcended and exalted by Sean O'Hagan, the High Llamas' resident genius. There's nothing like ""Gideon Gaye"" anywhere. Do not let the seeming lightness of this album fool you. It is a particularly tender surrealism, with a distinctly English conservatism -- and by that, I don't mean the Religious Right or anything like that. Rather, the conservatism lies in the preservation of old values -- small towns, country lanes, gentility -- expressed in terrific rock and roll. Absolutely brilliant, with that marvelous mixture of the new and the old that T.S. Eliot explored in ""Tradition and the Individual Talent."" The High Llamas embrace both."
5,"""Holland"" on Sea","Gideon Gaye is the first introduction I had to the High Lamas. Sean O'Hagan's previous arrangement and production work for Stereolab are the driving force behind this extension of the West Coast US - Brighton axis. Littered with Brian Wilson's melodic flourish this LP has the dreamy melancholia of 'The warmth of the Sun' mixed with the counter culture and everyday sadness of the English South coast off season. Gideon Gaye, in such tracks as 'the goat' retains O'Hagan's characteristic nod to French experiementalism whilst not being so dominated by nob twiddling as in earlier Stereolab works. It is a foreunner of greater LP's to come"
4,"Content very good, audio quality bad","Very good to get an overview over ASP.NET with C#. The only downside is the really bad audio quality. If your time is worth more than $5 an hour, buy this DVD. It can save you a lot of time."
2,Very bad... very unprofessional,The guy just rambles on and on... Audio quality is horrible...If you are very new to C# and Visual Studio you might learn a few basics... but it's hard to get through. This is the only reason why I didn't give it only 1 starI wish I had listed to the first reviewer.
5,SSI Bore Cleaner,"I am very satisfied with this item. In addition to the rope cleaner, it has a separate rope with a bore brush attached."
3,Does okay.,First time I bought one of these 'pull through' style cleaners. Not really that impressed. I put a cleaning patch around the little brush part soaked with Hoppes and it does okay (brush could stand to be a little longer or more substantial). Probably will stick with my one piece rod for serious cleaning. But this is quick and would certainly be better than not cleaning at all.
3,two separate pieces two lines,"the way the images look, seems like a single piece so with a single swipe you use brush plus swabNOTnow would it work ok, and great price, YESbut understand its not as convenient as the brand name item, but would work, what's the use of the brush on a rope if you can just use your regular rods. then swab with ""snake""great price and i got it quick, didn't use it sent it back, it would be better if they picture two separate items then together"
3,Didnt get this product.,"NRG was out of stock and could not give a definate resupply date to the distributer that was selling it.That being said, the vendor did an excellent job of sending me a megan brace at the same price. Excellent customer service."
1,Difficult,"These were terrible. It took me several minutes just to figure out how they assembled, and by the time I finally got them together, they looked totally disheveled, lopsided, and the lid wouldn't even stay closed! Will be returning this item to the store from which I bought it and trying something else."
5,wonderfully done,"Although not the real soundtrack from this great movie,it is excellant, and it must be considered that this particular dvd has 2 advantages, it is affordable, and it is available, 2 very big plusses, as this is an extremely hard John Barry dvd to find.I completely enjoyed it as I did the movie, yes, over and over.I'm very glad I could find it at a affordable price, and availability.If you liked the movie, and the soundtrack this will not disappoint."
2,Not recommended,"I didn't find this book useful at all.They do not get much into detail, expecting you know what you are doing.Then again, I bought this book around the time that I started using linux.The book does touch on some problems, but then just dumps you off wondering.Also, I've found SpamAssassin to be overrated; it's only plus being the simplicity of setup.While it is very difficult to setup, I've found that dSPAM is far superior in terms of accuracy."
4,Lovely Soundtrack.......To an enjoyable movie!,Brought this CD after watching the Jane Eyre 1996 movie Starring William Hurt. The music in the movie is lovely as is the movie and it draws you in as you watch the story of Jane Eyre.I enjoyed the score so much when watching the movie that I had to buy the soundtrack. I think this CD will only be enjoyed by the people who have seen the movie and loved the 1996 version.
5,basic & 12-lead interpretation,I have taken classes and never quite understood the interpretation of 12-lead until I read this book. There are sample ECG strips and the explainations are clear and precise. Treatment options for each arrythmia are included. This book is GREAT and all of the arrythmias are discussed in detail and in a clear format; THANKS for teaching me!!!!!
5,Interpretation of basic and 12 lead ECG,This book is so AWESOME and very helpful clinically. I carry it in my lab coat everyday.....THANKS!!!!!
3,Can I buy just half?,"How could you let someone ruin ""That's Entertainment"" the way Reef did? It's like letting Motorhead cover ""For No One"" by the Beatles. Morrissey's version was a million times better, but unfortunately, it didn't end up here. You can rip the Gallagher's but they did some of the best work on this record, hands down. Borrow this cd from a friend and just tape or burn the good tracks."
2,Go Buy Snap,"Though a heart felt tribute to one of Britain's best and most inspriational bands could be thrilling, and judging by many of the names on this album, you would think it should be, this is rather tedious. Reef does the worst cover of ""That's Entertainment,"" outside of my shower. Everything But the Girl does a xerox of the original ""English Rose"" without out all the teenage passion and innocence to give it meaning. Ben Harper should stick to his dreary Hendrix pastiches, and Gene's cover of ""Town Called Malice"" is a travesty. Why I bet they have never even heard a Motown record in their lives! The good stuff includes Buffalo Tom's slowed down romp through ""Going Underground"", and Noel's acoustic kereoke of ""To Be Someone"", which gives a true sense to the burnout behind the lyrics. Even Weller sounds tired on the hidden track. File under for completists only."
1,Thinly Disguised Demagoguery,"By title, this book claims to be a ""how to"" guide. The first section, however, belies this by explaining that you should leave it to professionals. Having thus disposed of the technical aspects, the author fills the remainder of the product with self-righteous, ultra-greenie, anti-capitalist claptrap, unsupported by fact or even verifiable cites. Not even well written propaganda, and most certainly not useful to anyone wishing to learn anything useful about installing a PV system."
1,The Easy Guide To Solar Electric Part 2,"I found this book at the public library in my search for a good guide to solar electric systems. I found a small amount of the information useful but, most was a waste of my time. The writer does not explain ideas in a very coherent manner. He uses a great deal of book space attempting to be funny and expressing his political views. If you are interested in a good solar electric book this is not it. I am still looking."
1,"Too much off topic, often incorrect",This book is basically a rant sprinkled with a few facts and several incorrect statements. It is on the suggested reading list in CT for the license exams- completely unreasonable in my opinion. I think with a little bit of effort one could extract all the useful information and reprint it on maybe 4 pages. When I want a narrative I read a novel. When I want a technical book I expect just that.
1,Easy Guide to SE,"For me, this book was terribly bad; not worth the buy. It might appeal to a different crowd."
1,Major ripoff,"I've met this guy. Don't waste your money buying anything from this artist. Yes, he's written some good songs. I don't like all of them, but some of them are very good. The problem is that I wasted my money buying CDs what won't play on my computer and they're blocked so you can't play the songs on your MP3 player either. How many people still use anything besides their MP3 player to play music anymore. I even offered to buy a digital version of the songs I like best to put on my MP3 player but he is so paranoid that people are going to steal his music that he won't even allow that. All I want to do is play the songs on my MP3 player. They don't do me any good sitting in their cases collecting dust. He got his money. I got nothing but CDs that I can't use.And, I've checked copyright rules and he is not correct on his site where it says you cannot put a copyrighted song on your computer or MP3 player."
2,Probably My Poor Shopping Skills,"I was hoping to learn how to do lettering by hand, learning the entire alphabet. What this is is a series of projects with some lettering in premade sayings that you use carbon paper to trace and then paint the project."
3,Dad's Week Off,"National Lampoon's Dad's Week Off is an all right movie. There's some funny scenes, but some of the dialouge is just stupid. It's one of Neal Israel's better films though. This isn't a real Lampoon movie; the only connection it has is the new owner, James P. Jimirro, co-executive produced it. This was one movie in a seven-picture deal NatLamp made with Paramount and Showtime. Two better movies are Favorite Deadly Sins and The Don's Analyst."
5,Great Ideas,My father-in-law loved it so much that he wanted to give a copy of everyone in the family! I ordered many copies for distribution.We all need to step back and apply some of the concepts every day.I never sang in my life and inspired by this book I started singing which surpisingly people love.
4,Great Nuggets of Advice,It's amazing how such simple things can slowly add up to larger changes. I've made a list of all the little changes I want to make now and we'll see how effective this process can be.Well written book with good personal insights on how to shift experiences and build a better life.
2,Ehhhh it's okay,"When I initially bought this book I thought it would be more of a book on small changes I hadn't thought of before. But, the more I read it, the more I realized how stupid this book can be. The first part of this chapter is on how to breathe. I mean come on people. They also give exercises for eyeballs and bathroom yoga. I'm sorry but I'll pass. I also didn't care for the Christian feel I got with some of the ""suggestions"". Example p. 40-41 ""Here are some other mealtime small changes you can make into habits. Say a prayer, either a ritual prayer from an organized religion or one you write yourself. Sing a song or recite a verse."" Christian book is it? The 2 stars are for the inital chapter that got me interested in the book. The rest is junk."
2,"Good Tutorial, Bad Test Prep","I really enjoyed this book. It's explaniations are incredibly good and it explains SQL Server very well.However, the exam questions suck.Two Examples:Page 230: Question 4 - It says the correct answer is D, but there is no such command as sp_grantaccess ( It should be sp_grantdbaccess )Page 232: Question 8 - again, there is no such command as sp_activateapprole, it's sp_setapprole.I could go on, but it's really frustrating trying to use a book for an exam when it misleads like this."
2,Explanations Incomplete,"This book is very uninspired. The layout is pretty good, but I am finding lots of places where there are incomplete explanations which causes lots of wasted time. If you already know the product that wouldn't be bad, but then you wouldn't need this book. Look for a better baisc Admin book."
3,The B-side is the surprise winner,"Ever hear a tune that's well composed and produced, sounds like something you'd like, yet doesn't click? That's Another Way, a thoroughly decent tune that has a harder dance beat, typical keyboard riffs, whispery vocals, and a synthetic ready-for-consumption feel. Four different versions are included to make it more appealing, to no avail.Thankfully, the B-side ""Avenue"" is surprisingly good. Sure, it too seems coldly produced, but at least it has a purpose- to get you moving. It's got a harder beat, and chooses a techno feel over typical trance melody, complete with trademark Van Dyk squiggly noises and faux-traffic sounds. When the keyboards kick in, they feel like they actually belong.Finally, you get a 20 minute mixed version of these two songs together, but since I can only recommend one, I say try to track down the excellent ""Avenue"" on a compilation somewhere."
4,You have to be a cold war history buff,"I enjoyed the movie, but I am a history buff. I really foundit amusing. A definite ""must"" for anyone who travelled toEastern Europe before the fall of Communism. $60 is kind of expensive...I'd look at to see if you can rent it. You will probably only watch it once or twice."
3,"More footage, less interviewing....","The footage of Communist musicals were precious, and I won't say that the interviews with directors, actors, and audiences weren't informative, but the sight of these musicals were so unique that I became frustrated when they kept cutting over to lengthy interviews that often became repetitive. Still worth seeing, though probably worth renting and watching once or twice..."
5,Fun for the whole family!,"My husband watched Pinky & the Brain in college, and he still loves it now. The smart humor intertwined with the classic physical comedy of cartoons makes this watchable for our whole family, ages 3-33. Our 8 year old watches and looks up the historical and cultural references on the computer. A great show!"
4,Pinky and the Brain Vol2,If you liked them in the Animaniacs you will love them in their own show. Lots of laughs. I wish there were more bonus features.
3,Too many mediocre episodes,"If you hadn't seen the first season - or the episodes in the Animaniacs - you would wonder why there was such enthusiasm for this series. The basic P&B; formula - intricately plotted schemes involving over-the-top assumptions/requirements and parodying major movies and the like - is missing from too many of the episodes here. It's as if the authors of those scripts had seen P&B;, but not understood the concept.The front-loading of particularly lame episodes emphasizes the problems of this volume: I inadvertently loaned this volume to a friend - instead of volume 1 - and the feedback was ""It gets better if you stick with it."" My understanding is that the volume represents the original order of the episodes, rather than trying to be something that stands up as an isolated product.My rating of mediocre is based upon these episodes being more enjoyable to an established fan than to someone encountering the material for the first time."
1,still have not received,"It has been almost a month since the proposed delivery date, and I still have not received this item. I am sure it would be a great additiong to my library if I was able to view it."
3,ok at the price,"I have some problems with this camera. I did not notice it has no optical viewfinder, so it eats batteries, especially in cold weather. The battery compartment opens too easily, the batteries fall out often. The instructions are minimal. This is my first digital camera, so there has been too much trial and error. For example, I still don't know how to use the flash as a fill flash, or even if that is possible. Finally, the disk-loaded program that loads the photos to my computer has not yet worked. Both the auto mode and scene mode (for snow) worked well, the pictures look fine."
4,Very good (cost-benefit)!,The cam is good and cheap. The problem is only about the battery... it goes really fast.
1,unpredictable battery life!,"Takes nice quality pictures, but the unpredictable battery life is frustrating as hell!Turn it on*beep beep*Battery is dead. ...or is it?Turn it back on [3 or 4 more times]Works fine [SOMETIMES]I've used many different kinds of batteries [brand new ones] and this is a consistant and irritating problem. This could be the best camera in the world but it doesn't mean anything if it won't turn on!Incredibly annoying. Am i the only one with this problem?"
5,Very Satisfied,Wow! This bad boy is awesome. Very small and compact but knocks alot of punches. It is has everything you could possibly want in a camera. Great Bargain! Get it before they're all gone.
3,"Nice and Small, But Awful Pictures","This camera is nice and small and is pretty easy to use. The large LCD screen on the back is very crisp and nice.BUT it is a battery hog, probably because it has no view finder and no way to turn off the huge . You must invest in the premium ilthium photo batteries. The regular Duracells / Energizers will be gone after just 8 photos. I recently took this camera on a safari to Africa. I took about 200 photos and -- I am not kidding -- ended up going through 28 batteries! (couldn't get the more expensive photo kind in Kenya)...Also, I am not much of a photographer, but I have gotten much better quality photos (more crisp, better colors) from other point-and-click cameras such as the Kodak EasyShare or Canon Doubleshot.Also, this is one of those annoying cameras that has about a 2 second delay between when you press the button and when it actually snaps, due to multiple layers of red-eye flickering. SO annoying. Makes it so much more difficult to get a good shot."
4,Changed to 1 star!!!!,"UPDATED: This camera is a royal pain. After using it for awhile, I wish I could change to 1 star. I believe there is a flaw in the battery power sensor; it will shut down due to low battery, but if you test the battery later it will show 80% charged.Another big issue: usually each time I use it, the camera will just shut off while i'm about to snap a picture (with the lens still extended). This isn't auto-shutoff, since it does it as i'm actively zooming and setting up the shot. I have to remove the batteries, wait a minute, put them back in and hold the power button down to get it to come back on."
2,Frustrating,"I think that I would like the camera if the batteries lasted long enough for me to take a picture with! I placed at least 8 new sets of batteries in the thing and it wouldn't even turn on. I did manage to find a decent set of batteries that lasted maybe half a day. I was so disappointed that I returned it and sought another camera with an internal rechargeable battery. The zoom wasn't that great either, some of my pictures turned out blurry even though I held the camera ultra still."
1,"battery problems, with rechargeables","Hi, I got this camera, and it worked fine for the first year or so on rechargeable batteries, but after a while, it doesn't matter what battery you put in, you can only take a couple pics, max, before it tells you the battery is dead.....I just realized that the problem wasnt me, i thought I was messing up my sustem of used batteries and newly charged batteries, and went to using dispoable, and then back to my rechargeables....doesnt matter what I use, I cant get much out of them.....Up until the battery issues, I was very happy with this little camera, thought it had lots of bells whistles for the 100 I paid for it, and I loved the video features....great camera if they fix the battery issue that I am apparently not the only one to have"
1,Not compatible with Windows Vista,"I bought this camera (in black) from an independent seller on Amazon about a year ago, and I have never been able to use the camera because I have Windows Vista. I've been waiting for Samsung to provide compatible software and drivers, but no go."
5,Beltronics RX65 Pro Blue,Great product and I love the blue display. The vendor delivered as promised with no surprises.
2,Inadequate Attachment Design,I have had this product slightly less than a year. I have not had a speeding ticket but that is due to driving with the traffic flow versus solitary high speed driving. It detects the radar and alarms as one would expect.My biggest complaint is it routinely falls off the windshield mount without any warning. The spring locking mechanism is weak and if I'm going up a hill on the highway and drive over a rough spot the thing slides off the metal clip and lands on the floor. The suction cups and bracket are still attached to the windshield. When this happens it's startling and maddening. This has been my experience.
4,Reliable and durable,"I have been using Beltronics' radar detectors for more than 10 years. My last model lasted for about 6 years. So far I'm very pleased with this one.Pros:- The blue led is super cool and makes it looks sophisticated- Setup is very easy- Build quality is great and has a good weight and solid feel- Very reliable and picks up most, if not all, of the radars (and also laser!!) in my areaCons:- The range is not as far as my last Beltronics model but I believe the government imposed a limit on how far these modern detectors could go a few years back"
2,Dependable Protection?,I received my RX65 detector and immediately put it to use. It did detect radar for a total of 8 days and then quit working completely. I purchased detector for a vacation trip and now in order to be able to use it I have to pay shipping to send it back to factory for repairs/replacement of unit. Just not too dependable for protection.
3,under the radar,I have not really seen any police with radar since I bought the detector. It goes off a lot when I get to a red light and drive my neighborhood police station. The suction cups and clip are flimsy otherwise it is a highly rated detector. The price was very good with the sale price and extra 20% off. I would not have paid full price for it.
2,Good... until it fails. Or until you're hit with LADAR,"OK so I had this for about 6 months before it died. I kinda think it was the SmartPlug that died, but haven't bought a new one to verify. I also never got around to trying to get service while it was under warranty, so I can't speak to whether or not they're helpful in that case, but I doubt that they would be.In those 6 months, it never really ""saved me"" for sure, but it certainly made a lot of noise. I live in an urban area, and apparently radar is around every corner. I guess it's kind of like ""better safe than sorry"", so slow down when it beeps, but at some point it's like... OK I guess I'll just drive under the speed limit.Now that LADAR (Laser RADAR) is getting more popular, these things won't help you so much. By the time they detect the LADAR, you're done for.Mostly I'm just a bit peeved that I paid hundreds of dollars for this thing and it stopped working after 6 months. To me, that's unacceptable. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Beltronics RX65,"First day out. Brand new car, brand new Beltronics RX65. Got popped by radaron the Taconic state parkway. I came over a ridge, heading north and the trooper was sitting in the valley between the north and south bound lanes facing me.As soon as I got a visual on him I knew he got me. Not even a tiny peep out of the RX65. He threw it into drive and hightailed it after me. The detector never made a sound. I could not believe my eyes or ears and it cost me $145 to Fishkill township. Really disappointed. Bottom line is don't trust these things to save you."
4,be careful,"If you need a radar detector, you should buy the best. I bought it because of the online reviews at diferent websites. Although, it seems to be one of the best, please do not trust it too much. The 2-4 miles detection range has to be achieved on a flat straight highway, with a stupid cop shooting wide and far. There is a K-band speed detector at a highway merge in our city, and I have to drive uphill to see it in front of me about 1500 feet. The detector can not detect it if I can not see it, and as soon as I can see it after the hill, the detector goes off with 2 bars, and soon increase to 5 bars. I guess this would give you 1-2 seconds of responce time if it was a real gun. My point is, be careful. It is a tool to help after all."
5,The Best Radar Detector,"It's been a while since i've owned a radar detector, but thought it was about time to get one due to a couple of recent tickets!! This radar detector has since saved me over 10 times, given me enough notice to slow down and prevent getting another ticket.."
3,works good,"Ordered this for my husband. It seems to do its job, but is quite noisy at times. Would prefer if it didn't have the voice."
2,I expected more from BEL.,"I have owned BEL detectors for over 20 years now and I was excited about getting the RX-65 to replace my older 985 series. The reviews on this were glowing and said it was tops in the mid-range price line. The features are good and typical and it does not take long to set it up with your preferences. It looks sleek and is simple to operate. But even at top volume, you may miss some signals with the radio on and windows down. This model has reliably picked up the pigs in motion and on the roadside thus far, but it has way too many annoying false alarms. It likes to chatter off ""K1"" at many intersections and shopping plazas. My old 985 did not do this and was better designed in my opinion. BEL has taken a step backward with this model and that is not good. It might be time to spend a few more dollars and change brand loyalty for me."
4,beltronics radar detector,Still learning the various functions of the device but it seems to work well. Need to learn how to reduce the sensitivity. The alarm goes off constantly.
2,does not seem to work right,does not seem to work very well on Ka-Band and Lazer as I have passed many police cars and speed traps without a beep but it works well on the K-Band.
4,"Great detector, but.......","The only complaint I have about this is that the laser warning goes off constantly. It's so annoying that I finally just programmed that off. (It's not that useful, anyway.) Otherwise, range is terrific, the programming is kind of difficult (for an old codger), but I'm very satisfied."
4,beltronics radar detector,"I would recommend this product , it work very good and comes in a great travel case . I would suggest that you determine your instalation before ordering ,direct wire harness extra."
5,Radar Detector,"Beltronics is one of the most recommended brands. This is a great detector except that it lacks stealth. If you wanted stealth, spend another $150 or so and get the Beltronics STi Magnum. If you don't want to spend the extra money for stealth, this is the detector to get."
1,Item can't be used after only 10 months,"The single star is due to the frustration caused by dealing with this vendor's so-called 'guarantee"". After only 10 months, the detector will not stay attached to the clip with the suction cups for attaching to the front window. Every time I turn a corner or hit my brakes it slides off the clip and falls on the floor, which makes it pretty much unusable. I contacted Escort (who makes the Beltronics) and they informed me that even though I have had this unit for less than 1 year,I would have to pay to ship it back to them for repairs at a cost of nearly $10. What kind of guarantee is that? I will never purchase another Beltronics/Escort item that can't be returned to a store if it breaks. Thank goodness I kept my old Passport unit to use while I deal with this frustration. This is the last Beltronics I ever purchase."
2,"Great perfomance, lousy reliability","Performance is outstanding as advertised and noted above; when the unit works. This comment is based on years of owning multiple BEL detectors. BEL dropped the ball on this one.I have been upgrading to top of the line BEL's for quite a few years with no problems whatsoever. Yesterday, my Pro RX65 malfunctioned for the third time in the 1 year warranty period. A 10-15 day turnaround for repair, for the third time is unacceptable.I would not recommend this unit based on poor reliability. This is the last BEL, I will ever buy."
2,"when it works, all is good...","This is clearly the best radar detector I've owned, in terms of detecting radars. However, it is also one of the worst radar detectors available for purchasing. I got one in May 2006, and it worked very well...for a week. After a week, it died. Luckily, I was able to get a replacement, which worked very well until May of 2007. Of course, Amazon is not an authorized reseller, nor are any of the sellers who use amazon to sell this product, which means that right now I have no detector, and if I want to repair it, BEL will do it, but it will be expensive."
1,Will NOT Honor Warranty Claims from Amazon.com,"My Radar detector was purchased January 2010. One month later the detector stopped working and would not turn on. I verified it was not the power source or the cable; the unit was receiving power but would not turn on. Well I wasn't too happy but I knew it was covered by a 1 Year warranty. I called up Beltronics only to find out that they DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY CLAIMS for products purchased from Amazon.com!!! Even worse, they wanted $79.99 + shipping to fix the unit. Needless-to-say, I find their level of customer service inadequate and disconcerting given the volume of product they sell through this site. I will not purchase another Beltronics product and would advise highly against it given their lack of professionalism in standing behind the quality of their own product."
5,Best Radar,"Good quality radar , I had alway buy Bel Radars this is my 6th Bel that I had purchase , never have disappointments."
5,Best $200 I have spent.,All I can say about this detector is WOW. In southern California speeding tickets are over $500 sometimes. This detector has warned me of CHP a mile away when they are using the radar against traffic and yesterday it warned me 1/2 a mile when the officer was against the on-ramp .I am nothing but pleased with this purchase and I have only had it for a few weeks.
3,"After two years, it's having problems","It started out great and did it's job. Now it's freezing up, not shutting off or detecting. Seems Bell wants premium money just to look at it. After reading many sites and forums, this is a common occurrence."
1,Waste of Money,"Not effective at all on ""pop"" type radars. (Can't see how any detector could be.) Has broken down 3 times. I would not buy this product if I knew then what I know now."
2,Radar Detector does not work properly,"I bought this item on feb 5 and works good, but the laser detector does not work properly because detect the laser to late, for it detect laser after I passed the moving speed laser box, I sent beltronics and they supose fix it, but technician suggest me to buy the ZR4 shifthing Laser Defence System ($499) from the Escort Company, OMG really bad"
5,"Had and Escort 8500, upgraded to this...","I have been using an escort 8500, but over the last year or so I have been getting annoyed by the TSR in Ohio. I had to disable the K band just to drive to work without losing my mind. This unit has some kind of TSR filter that works great. I also notice that it seems a bit more sensitive than the escort 8500. I'm glad I went with this one. The blue light in the smart cord is brighter than the 8500, but I'm used to it now. Also my girlfriend thinks it is kind of annoying that the unit has a voice which tells you what band it is detecting. I'm pretty sure you can turn it off, I like it and she'll get used to it. Overall seems like this one is the best, I read a lot of reviews and it's a fair price."
5,Radar Detector,"Product gets great test reviews from multiple sources, and is much cheaper than the next level detector, the Escort 9500. Having owned three Beltronics detectors recently, have learned that the audio out circuit is subject to issues if you use an audio out cord for another speaker, or for connecting to a motorcycle communications system. Best make VERY sure you have the right cord connectors, as the slightest electrical problem will fry the audio out circuit.Detector in use on the road is superb, and the buyer should simply leave the many optional setting alone and use at the factory default settings."
4,Excellent radar detector,"I bought one of these badboys and installed it in my car after Johnny Law gave my wife a ticket for speeding. I haven't owned a radar detector in 20 years, but it's funny because they still haven't changed. You'll pick up every convenience store microwave or trucker with a powerful radio within miles. Lots of false alarms! Still, I'd rather the detector be too sensitive than non-responsive. There are many settings to calm things down and avoid the nuisance of false alarms. The unit itself works great and has all the features you'd want. My two gripes would be that the volume adjustment is very odd (you have to hold a button down and scroll through the softest and the absosolute loudest settings before you get where you want to be), and the unit does not come with a clip to attach it to a visor. On the plus side the unit comes with a thorough manual and a very nice padded metal carrying case (great for stashing the unit under the seat when not in use)."
1,very disapointing,Most overrated product I've ever owned. Only thing it picks up is traffic signals to drive you crazy. A k-mart detector for one third the money worked better. Over priced and overrated.
2,"did not work as well as it described on the website, Buy Valentine one","did not work as well as it described on the website. There is one day i been followed a cop.....only 10-15 meters behind me....they used xband radar to detect my speed,...while rx65 only give me a singal bar warning,...very weak...at this distance, should be full-bar warning.."
3,Mariad,"It's easy to use and a nice looking product with blue lights. I thought I was all that when I purchased this item but then I was cruising on the highway when all of the sudden a police car came up next to me and passed me and this item never alerted me. Apparently, as I later learned it only detects some police cars and not the ones on the freeway. Go figure. I wouldn't recommend the product."
1,Way to expensive.,These things are not worth the money .. get a cheap one! Look at http://www.radarbusters.com/ or www.007radardetectors.com or www.consumersearch.com.
4,Beltronics RX65,"So far, this product seems to be good. Picks up far less X Band notifications than my last detector, which is a good thing. Mute feature on plug is handy. My only complaint so far is that I can't turn volume up higher."
4,Radar Detector Review,"Great radar detector! I decided to go with the Beltronics over the Escort due to the audio alert being slightly louder on the Beltronics. It was a wise decision, especially since I listen to music fairly loud. However, at times when I am ""jamming out,"" the audio is but a whisper."
4,underground will live forever baby!,"Another solid release by Def Jux. This album's obscurity is what makes it unique from other releases of the year. This album has beats that are totally unlike anything I've ever heard. The flow of Mr. Lif and the energetic character of Akrobatik make this group a force to watch in years to come. Boston veteran Guru also makes an appearance. If you appreciate Hip-hop, you'll appreciate the Perceptionists. Cop it!"
4,Dope,"First, I should say this might be the best hip hop album I have heard in the last six months or so, but I unlike most of amazon.com I reserve 5 star reviews for classics. Therefore a new release cannot get 5 stars.this is a dope album with a nice mix of subject matter, some real serious political commentary and some humor mixed in. Tight beats from EL-P and Fakts One, and a nice guest suprising guest shot from Shock G.I thought Guru's guest spot was a little lazy-sounding and weak, but this is a very worthwhile, dope album."
5,Perfect for my need,"This tool is everything as advertised , reasonable price cuts cleanly and tucks into edge . Great tool . Priced right and does all I needed"
3,A clunky knife without an option to fold/hide the blade,"While ability to quickly fold/hide the sharp blade has become virtually ubiquitous in other similar tools, this knife lacks this basic option. Granted, this is not a tool to be used by a careless child, but even in professional hands, I can see it becoming a danger with a sharp blade on one end and a long enough leverage to slice deeply into the user's hand."
2,This is a book - you need a Tai Chi DVD,"This book is boring. Its illustrations were done on an old black and white copier. It is pretty much a waste of time and definitely a waste of money. I was looking at Tai Chi DVDs and somehow I bought this. Wonderless.I did however, buy Sunrise Tai Chi and Sunset Tai Chi and these are great. They each have an hour long demonstration section which I am still working on which are done slowly enough so I can see what is happening and follow along. These are 5 star products."
5,Wow!,"This book is fantastic. I purchased this because I have serious degenerative arthritis in just about every joint. Tai Chi is the best way to realign your body, this info was from arthritis specialists, pain management specialists and the most remarkable physical therapist I've every had the honor to know. He took to the book and it's teachings so much that I made a gift of it to him. He applies these methods to just about every patient he helps. Now, I've got to buy me another one!"
2,Don't Look Too Close...,"This looks like a high end fixture from afar, but closeup, the fit and finish aren't very good. The metal edges don't come together very well. If you have it high on the wall, you probably won't notice, but I wanted to use two of them vertically on each side of a large round mirror. The white light covers are 1/2 rounds of bent glass in a cold white and are very opaque, and are open on the sides, so you might see the bulbs when you look up. I'm returning mine uninstalled, so I couldn't say for sure.Also, be aware they stick out from the wall quite a bit, so if you have something on an adjacent wall near the corner such as a medicine cabinet, this will get in the way, if you are installing them vertically."
4,"Very nice for the money, with a couple of cons","This product is, overall, a real bargain. It looks elegant even though the materials quality is just OK. The extremely low price makes it very attractive. If it wasn't for con number 2 below, I would have given it a 5-star.Fairly easy to install.Cons: 1) The bulb fittings are not precisely machined. You need to be careful when install bulbs and jiggle them a bit to make sure you don't break the bulb and it screws completely into the socket. 2) My fixture had a bend on one of the corners that does not appear to have happened during shipping. I ended up leaving it as is, but may try to straighten it out sometime. I didn't notice it until after I had completed the install."
5,Very good mind-over-game dvd,"The drills are practical and easy to understand. The dvd nav lets you get to the topic fast and the information is delivered in a clear, tight format. I enjoy and continue to use the dvd. I just ordered the companion dvd ""Foresight 2"""
3,Decent bag,I was looking for a bag that would allow me to carry an extra pair of running shoes and the pictures for this bag show them easily stored in the outside pockets. I CAN put my size 11 running shoes in the pockets but I'm afraid I will damage the zipper because it is such a tight fit ( I really have to squeeze them in there ). Overall I like the backpack style and all the zippered pockets and pouches will allow me to organize and carry all my stuff. It's a keeper but I could have gone 5 stars had the shoes fit better.
3,Pro: Compact. Con: Not as good as some others,"I bought Oster electric knife after using a bulky Toastmaster electric knife with top handle at my mother-in-law's (not sure about exact model, but it looks similar to the Toastmaster Electric Carving Knife 6110).I had good experience using the Toastmaster and I liked the compactness of the Oster knife. I also liked that Oster came with a storage case (the bonus fork was not a deciding factor for me. As a matter of fact, I wish it was not included, so that the storage box could be smaller).The Toastmaster performed great cutting London Broil into nice uniform slices; I expected the same from Oster, but it did not perform as well. Due to it compact handle and lighter weight Oster knife was harder to keep straight and it required more pressure than the Toastmaster.Oster has nice looks and it is NOT a bad product, but, compared to the Toastmaster knife I used, the performance was not as good."
1,not well made,"After two uses, left blade stopped sawing. There's a clip in the handle that fits a notch in the blade, and it is too weak and too far out of alignment to catch the blade. Guess it's going to goodwill."
2,Not the Sharpest Knife In The Drawer,"I have been disappointed in this knife. I have had several electric knives but I've used this one on 2006 Thanksgiving Turkey and Christmas Ham. Both times I had to get a regular slicer knife to save face. I do know how to use a electric knife and know not to try and cut,""just out of the oven meat"". This needs more weight and redesigned blades for holding a sharp edge. Does come with a nice case and carving fork."
2,Oster Electric Knife,"I purchased this knife to replace one that I had used for over 20 years. I am very disappointed in the performance of this product, as compared to the one it replaced. It is not nearly as powerful and tends to just chew through the meat instead of cutting it clean."
4,Handels well,Had difficulty holding other knifes and operating the switch. This one works well in my hand. Glad I bought it.
3,Works well,About average for an electric knife. Works well but nothing special. The case is handy. The fork is a nice addition.
1,Oster #2803 electric knife,"I bought this Oster Electric Knife and it would just about get through refrigerated butter.Would not cut crusty bread, took forever to get through a lemon slice, a pitted peach, and a tomato.Absolute crap. Wrote the manufacturer, they refused to honor it. Wrote the sales group, with whom will never do business again because they did not answer... they knew what was coming...I had an electric knife for over 23 years, and it FINALLY kicked the bucket... Interesting that the quality of goods have dropped this far."
1,One of the worst,"I've received this as a gift Christmas of 2011. For many years I had a cheapo Hamilton beach electric knife and the motor finally burned out but the Hamilton Beach knife was superior quality of the OSTER 2803 Electric Knife. Honestly only use it on holidays for turkeys, ham etc...I will list some of the problems:1. The dual moving blades while cutting will separate and food slices will get jammed in between both blades like the knife is trying to slice two pieces. Extremely poor design.2. The little I've used this knife blades are extremly dull. I work up a sweat just cutting a simple ham.3. Power button periodically will not work. While cutting the motor just shuts off.My daughter bought this for us and didn't know what to tell her after having it for several months in the beginning. Do yourself a favor do not buy this product. Shame on you OSTER ripping people off with this piece of junk. I will definitely go back to Hamilton beach electric knife.Susan G.Sewell, NJ"
2,Oster disappointment,"I purchased an Oster 2803 electric knife based on the recommendations arising out of an America's Test Kitchen electric knife testing segment. I had previously owned a Cuisinart CEK-40 electric knife with the two sets of cutting blades but it was getting tired after a lot of heavy use and I thought the Oster would be the best choice to replace it. I was wrong. The Oster tended to tear rather than cut sour dough round loaves, a staple in my kitchen, and had great difficulty cutting through the bottom crust of the loaf. It was nothing special on meat and in fact I went back to using my regular cutting knives for carving meat and poultry. I bought another Cuisinart CEK-40 and discarded the Oster and have never looked back. The Cuisinart works great on meat and on bread and cuts the round sour dough loaves with ease, including the bottom crust. I would not recommend the Oster but I highly recommend the Cuisinart CEK-40."
1,Very poor quality - Dangerous,"I finally broke out this electric knife to carve a roast beef. Firstly, I noticed the ""safety"" lockout was nearly worthless; you could easily power the blades without any fuss. A safety feature should give the operator a little trouble to assure there is no accident. Next, one side of the blade kept popping out of locked position while in use, negating the sawing action of the blades. I took the nice fork it came with and put the rest of this in the garbage can. I have been told by my friend, the emergency room nurse, that electric carving knives get her a lot of business around the holidays. I'll bet this model ranks high in that statistic."
2,Short blade,This was listed to have a longer blade than it actually does. I purchased this knife for my Grandma for her bread slicer and it was too short to reach the other side.
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I am extremely disappointed in this knife. I have used it on roast beef and turkey and instead of slicing the meat, it shreds it. The only thing it cut well was a piece of 4 inch thick foam. I would not recommend this knife to anyone."
1,There are currently no fork!!,I am very upset because this electric knife is for a gift and come to me without the fork that the Oster offers as a bonus!I feel I was robbed!
3,Oster Inspire Electric Knife,It came and the plastic box is broke . I also had one before and it came with more knifes so I will have to see how it performance now. I did like the idea of it coming with the box for storage so that's disappointing a little.
2,electric knife,This knife did not perform well. Holding the power switch and carving was awkward. It also did not cut as well as I would have expected for an Oster product. Is ok for occasional use which is why I bought it for my daughter. I have an electric knife that is over 10 years old and it works a lot better than this one.
1,junk,"very hard to insert blades, blades seperate and food goes between them which causes a loss of cutting power. this happened on a cucumber. its not worth the effort to return it. in all my years of dealing with amazon this is my first disappointment."
1,Useless,I got this knife for Christmas to replace one I'd had about 15 years. This is the worst electric knife I have ever used. The blades are very dull and make it very difficult to cut. Tonight I tried to cut a ham. I got a thin slice of ham coming up between the blades in addition to the one I was trying to cut. I think my last electric knife was a $6.99 special and it outperformed this knife 20 to 1. This is going back to the store tomorrow.
4,Fantastic!,I am 73 years old and just got this for a gift. It is the best electric knife I have ever used.
5,"Great, long-lasting product!",This is the second Oster knife I have bought. The first is still working but i lost the blades and decided to purchase a newer model. So far no complaints!
1,Hot Handed,"I should of listen to the other poor reviews. Oster is a fine product in most cases. I've had other Oster items like the Oster kitchen center, loved it. Not only did food get stuck between the blades, they came loose also. Hope your not trying to carve a turkey because the handle gets very hot. You need to set it down to cool down. What a disapointment, wanted to like it but couldn't. I am glad I bought it from Amazon because they took back with no problem's. Dont't waste your money and time."
2,Noisy and Dull Blades,"Nice design, but quite noisy and blades are not very sharp. Bad combination. Reasonable price but quite disappointed."
1,math errors,This book has various math errors. I would expect it to be right as we are using it to study for exams. I am not a math wizard but I expect a study book to be done without errors.
3,Information overload!,"There is a lot of info in here and I am not sure that it is really necessary. Some areas are not explained very thoroughly, ex. some math questions and some of the science. I would not reccommend it. I was studying for an HOAE exam and got fed up with this book and bought another one that was more helpful. Even the newer addition still has mistakes. You would think they would fix those by now!"
4,"Melodic, clever, and wry","I bought this album after reading a mini-review in a record store about it being ""underappreciated."" Since I tend to like a lot of underappreciated music, that was enough of a call to action! I am not disappointed. Beautiful music and lyrics. Melodic and melancholic, clever and wry. Really a great album, and I seem to listen to it non-stop. It has seeped into my consciousness and won't got away..."
5,If I could have only one book...,"...this is the one. I have read it many times since I was a young man. It is the best book on leadership that I have ever read. A great story told in a mesmerizing way; it is a difficult read because of the frequent Lakota phrasing, but well worth the effort."
1,Good luck trying!!!!,"This seller constantly advertises items like this, and NEVER, EVER completes a transaction. The listing shows a '25 pack' for sale and here's what is going to happen... Purchase it, and you'll shortly receive an email claiming 'the item is out of stock' OR they'll send you 1 blade, and claim they made a mistake in the listing. I know first hand, because they've done this to me on 5 different orders totalling over $2000 worth of DeWalt recipro blades. Just moments after they were listed, they magically ran out of stock. Even AFTER I double checked THEIR 'in-stock' totals. Good luck doing business here and DON'T SAY I TOLD YOU SO...."
5,Interesting,The movie is interesting if you are interested in something very different about a subculture. Read about the movie before you watch it because this will not be for everyone.
5,Great product,"Bout as a gift for a friend, was in great condition. Would do business again, very pleased! Thanks a lot"
2,For beginners,"This may be a great book for beginners; however, if you delved into publishing or maintaining pages using FrontPage, FrontPage 98 or even Notepad, this might be a little elementary, Watson. I give it a 'hold' and recommend a trip to the reality based bookstore for a real-time hands browse before giving out your credit card number over the Internet (horrors!).Again, it might be good, but I'm beyond what it has to offer... and haven't the time to review it, properly (just offering balance to the other reviews)."
4,"Not too bad, but not what I was looking for.","The book was arranged nicely and easy to follow, but everything I wanted to know was either an 'extra credit' item or referred me either to the first book of the series, or to the programs help file. What's up with that? If I could actually use the help file, I would not have had to buy the book! Now I have to buy another book to cover the items I really wanted to learn about."
4,Kids Party Games and Activities.,"This book was arranged in 3 age groups. Tha's really helpful, so you can zoom in on your child's party and find just the right activities. Each section includes lots of traditional games as well as innovative ones and other party activities, like face painting. Also included are trip parties and theme parties for each age group.Each game or activity includes creative suggestions for adapting the game, ideas for prizes and troubleshooting common problems ahead of time. The game directions are complete and easy to follow.This book will offer ideas for many parties to come. The games may be dropped into your theme. The theme parties offered here are easy and fun and offer the inspiration to add your own ideas."
5,Lots of Party Suggestions,"I purchased this book because I own and operate a little girls' party room. We got a lot of party activity ideas out of here. Many of the craft ideas are easy to get together, easy for the kids and make great party favors. Party planning made simple."
4,Lovely,"I've only heard three of the set and I came on to purchase them all, only to now discover that the set is actually 9 cds!! I can't imagine the other songs I'll hear on the other 6. The music is LOVELY, so nicely arranged, such a wonderful collection (thus far) and any true love music fan will be impressed. Absolutely LOVELY!!"
1,This Shark movie isnt all that,"I wouldnt buy this movie unless you like other sea creatures as well!!! this is just not sharks, they didnt even cover all the sharks. they showed a real quick shot of the Great White but that was it! wasnt worth the money for me, 1 star"
1,Sharks - 3D,"As a 3D production, I was extremely disappointed. The content was acceptable, but it certainly was not what I expected in quality for a 3D production."
3,Not very interesting or informative.,Dissapointing DVD. Watched it with 2 adults and 5 children and evern though it's relatively short a few of us dozed off. The 3D is fair at best. Didn't learn too much and it wasn't very entertaining.
3,Not much shark material,"This should not have been titles 'Sharks'.Sharks make up probably less than a quarter of this show. That also don't show most of the popular sharks (tiger, bull, lemon, mako, blue). They spend too much time on other sea life. It is still an enjoyable show, however the title is misleading. There is one point where they go 10 plus minutes without showing or talking about sharks."
4,Great gpu,I am running at stock speeds and it performs well. Great for all but the most demanding app's and games. With 8 system fans it is stable at 55-60*c.Another winner from XFX.
2,Long Dull and uneventful,"I have rarely given up on a series and I am the first to jump on the big book sets. This book just did not do it for me. I had bought the first 3 and took the other two back.The book is very uneventful and dwells on small details that do not advance the story and leave the tired eyed reader dazed. Way too many characters and location names to keep track of without keeping notes. Add on top of all that mess the story is written in lousy broken English and you have a mess. I opened to a random quote page 396. The very first sentence I read.. so I not looking hard for a bad line. ""Ill guard your back from any enemy I can see wi' my two eyes and smite `im wi' whate'er I find to hand, but, gods, I don't like this `un. How do you read that at 2am in the morning after 6 hour reading marathons.I found the climax areas very dull. The villains unbelievable and the heroes wanting."
3,an interesting read,"This book starts out slow, as the first book in a series often does. Once the plot gets underway, Tristen, a shaping in the form of a young man, learns about the reality of the world, and begins to understand his own ability and purpose. The language of this book is rather odd, but the detail and depth is nice. I'm not about to run out and buy the sequel, but I would keep an eye out for other books by the author for future library visits."
3,A different diversion for fantasy fans,"Normally, I breeze through books at a whipped up pace. I can get through King and Goodkind in (max) a weekend. But this book took me almost a MONTH to read. Not because it was bad, but because I read literally every single word. No trite, hack writing here! Every sentence seemed artfully and specifically crafted. The imagery spawned by the writing was remarkable. I lived in the world every time I opened the book, and got sucked into the story in the first two pages. It truly was like no other book I've ever read. Not necessarily better or worse. Simply different. I'd have rated it higher, but for the ending, which seemed too short, convenient, and contrived for the suspense and anticipation leading up to it. For anyone who favors fantasy, I'd recommend this book as an enjoyable diversion from the pile of clones out there."
2,Slow and irrelevant for the most part...,"I really have nothing wrong with this book, but to me it seems as if most of the focus is on how this prince should conduct a war. I think it's way too much of a politically focused viewpoint. The whole story and mystery behind Tristen is very interesting, and going into his mind is quite fun, but when it switches back to Cefwyn and his problems, I just groan because it doesn't seem important at all. There is not enough action in this story, and when I sparely come across it, it is written vaguely. And another thing that just screams vague is when Tristen enters his special ""gray place."" It is nearly impossible to visualize anything.I ask myself: is it worth it to read the sequels?"
2,"Could have been better! (in other words, it kinda stunk!)","This book was interesting in the beginning, but nothing was explained and it got worse as you went on. The plot wasn't clear and a lot of the characters didn't much have personality. I think that Cherryh could have done much better, especially at the end."
4,Starts slow...gets better,"I can see why some gave up on this book. The intial development of the main character (Tristen) gets a little tedious. However, I even enjoyed this section because of the excellent writing style of Ms. Cherryh. Also, I think that the author was purposely leading us through what is really the early chilhood of Tristen, after his shaping. This takes a bit of patience.Foolish me, I thought this was a stand alone novel, and as I read further I wondered how the story could pobbibly be wrapped up in one book--which it isn't, of course.This was a worthwhile read, despite the slow start. I intend to read the sequel."
3,Not bad--needs work though,"I picked up Cj Cherryh's work for the first time when I picked up her ""fortress in the eyes of time."" I had wanted to read why she won so many awards, and which book won it for her...I was sorry to say I picked the wrong novel.--It shows that you should always read the book alot in the stores first, before you decide to buy it. Anyway...I felt the beginning was long and tedious, and the ending, well, lets just say it felt not like an ending. It was a bit anti-climatic. Her character descriptions and scenery details were her strengths, as was her creativity. Her action and POV however, were not. Her action felt unreal at times, and it was hard to get a grip on who was telling the story...Then I picked up her other novels ""Cyteen""..etc...she should stick to Sci-Fi books."
4,"Comprehensive, Detailed and Consolidated",The title of the review says it all... the most consolidated and detailed resource on modular homes that I found in my research. I would recommend this title as a great starting point to anyone who has an interest in the modular housing industry.
5,"Excellent and thorough, impartially addresses all aspects of the Modular home building process","As an executive with more than 38 years of home building experience, including 19 years building Modular homes, I find the Modular Home book to be the most thorough, helpful and informative book written on Modular homes. It provides detailed information to both the general population and to others skilled in building trades. I highly recommend this book to anyone considering a home purchase and to Builders who might consider a popular alternative to site built housing."
3,not for me,"It is hard to judge from the description, but the book is mostly about ""old school"" modular homes -- no edgy designs, no new technologies, etc. Given how much new and exciting developments there have been in the pre-fab space recently, this book seems quite dated"
3,insufficient information and impartiality for the research-minded or building saavy,"unfortunately the most thorough presentation of modular architecture to date, this book is written with insufficient information and impartiality for the research-minded or building saavy. aimed more at the general populus than those familiar with the building trades, this book is described by the author as largely a collection of the brochures he has written to educate his consumers. as it is authored by a modular home professional, it does not present information with enough imparitial information for the serious researcher to swallow without a large grain of salt. that said, it does, however, manage to cover some bits and pieces of more in depth information with a voice that is tempered by experience and well organized enough to display his history of explaining the market niche to the uninitiated."
4,Pre Fabricated Homes,"This book is great for anyone who wants to learn the basics of investing in a Modular Home. I would recommend this to anyone who thinks they may be interested in purchasing a Modular. The book will educate you on everything you will need before you meet with a builder. If money and quality is a concern, don't sit down with a builder before you read this."
4,Great and Cheap Router,"Got this thing for a pretty good price, now it's even cheaper. Bought it for a Mac network in my house, running enet cable through the walls to the bedrooms. Works great for @Home Cable modem, which is what I am running. Don't follow the directions in the manual, just put in all your ISP settings in the config. panel and set all your other computers connected to the router to DHCP. Worked great for me. Only compaint is that the 4 ports are on the front, so cables are going in both front and back, which makes it akward to sit on a desktop. Other than that, it does the trick."
5,Easy setup; made my connection faster!,"Just wanted to make three points about this great product:1) Setting it up consists of filling out web-based forms from your favorite browser -- so if you can order this product from Amazon, then you already know how to set it up when you get it home!2) It increased my cable modem performance! This won't happen to everybody, but for me I think the reason was that I previously had the cable modem connection going through a USB adapter (I have @Home in SF Bay area). When I got rid of the USB adapter, performance went from a maximum download speed of 300KBps (that's kiloBYTES), to 450KBps! Sweet!3) You can hook up a dial-up modem as a backup. This is handy, because you don't have to muck with your computer network settings whatsoever. Usually when you switch ISPs you have to do said-mucking.All in all a very nice product."
4,"Hot, but not quite out of the box","Although I had to download and install a firmware upgrade before it was fully functional, this turned out to be a terrific device, performing as advertised. I had trouble accessing the router's internal web page, but tech help was available within 5 minutes and very helpful (and this at 12:30 AM EDT). This may not be a device for totally rank beginners, but its very close. Well done, SMC!"
5,Outstanding features/price,"I don't have a broadband connection at home, but I still wanted to be able to share a dial-up connection among several computers with one device. This little switch has met my needs perfectly. I took it out of the box, plugged it in, and enjoyed a home network for the first time. There was basically no configuration needed; there is a simple-to-use web interface which allows you to enter the information for your ISP. I have an external modem plugged in for my dial-up, and it works like a charm. The print server is a nice touch -- I have a Canon BJC-210, just a little $80 inkjet printer -- and my computers are able to print to it quite easily via the included software. Perhaps the only caveat I've encountered is that when you are sending a document to the printer, the network seems to slow down substantially. But this could be an issue with my configuration. All in all, this SMC switch has been a marvel. It's really nice when something works so perfectly out of the box."
2,Web interface seems to hang,"I have symptoms like a previous reviewer stated: the router seems to hang frequently when printing. Also, the web page access also seems to hang frequently (especially if you don't logout from a previous session)."
4,no real problems,"Good Item. Works fine for me. Apparently there's no logging though. For the most part everything works great, but every now and then (once a week or more) I need to turn it off an on. That's to be expected I guess."
3,Large collection - average orchestra,"This CD is a great collection of many of the best movie tunes from the old west (as well as a few selections, while great movie music, are not from the old west - i.e. Gettysburg). A few of the tempos seem rushed to me and the City of Prague Philharmonic, while good, is not a great orchestra. You can hear the trumpets and horns straining at times. I would still buy it again, though for some of the selections, I prefer other recordings that are available."
4,The Wild West: Essential Western Film Music Collection,"I was pleasantly surprised. Even though they are not the original composers, I enjoyed the collection, especially ""The Cowboy's"" (John Williams, ""Silverado"" (Bruce Broughton), and the theme of ""Sons of Katie Elder"" (Elmer Bernstein) It was a real treat!!"
3,Marginal at best,"This collection has Gettysburg and Glory from another Silva Collection (Hollywood Goes to War) and the same strident-sounding track. One wonders how much duplication Silva is going to do in the future!Some of the other tracks are very good, particularly the quieter ones. The Prague brass section is forced and almost unbearable, however.Frankly, for the quality, these two-disc sets of Silva in general are overpriced. The two-disc set should sell for about $16.00.Although of variable quality throughout, the Silva productions do provide good collections on CD...just don't expect great performances as a rule. However, there are some really great ones (see The Omen, Jerry Goldsmith, 'Under Fire' tracks, for example...super)."
5,Best Classic Western Music,"Not only does this CD bring back memories of favorite western movies, it's also just good music. I listen to them at work along with it's companion ""Way Out West"", at home while I'm working, and in my car. They go with me everywhere. This was definitly one of my better purchases."
3,equations for my friends,"oasis : beatles , radiohead : pink floyd , high llamas : penny lane and pet sounds, to be more particular....get it? it's a familiar atmosphere, but these inspired bands make wonderful music building on previous milestones. what's even better is that these bands pull it off with integrity because every ounce of familiarity with the source comes from the innermost musical gut. we wouldn't have t.v. without radio, but nobody sits around and yaps about how much of a ripp-off t.v. is. they all sit down and watch it while stuffing themselves. this is good music according to my ears.....so, find out for yourself if you like it or not and don't worry about recognizing familiar melodies and such.....i'm in that trap and i almost hate myself for it...."
5,magnificent and complicated,"This is a difficult but extraordinarily significant recording. The Llamas seem to have ingested the whole history of American music -- from Stephen Foster to Paul Whiteman to Brian Wilson (especially Brian Wilson) and beyond -- and they have created a marvelous tapestry of sound. Do not be fooled by those who call this group derivative. They are the most intelligent and musical post-modern synthesists at work in classical or pop. For the first time in many years, the vanguard is in pop music."
4,gentile sunshine,"though there're total 29 tracks,but all the tracks seem to be combined into a single piece of melody,&the music is v.sweet & laid-back,allow u to take a good break &have a cup of coffee, if u like stereolab,u can't miss the high llmas at well."
3,Good for play,"My son loved receiving this backpack (he's 7) but when it arrived, I was expecting something larger, like school sized. It is small, so we use it to keep his action figures and he can carry it around outside or keep it stored in the house. It probably wouldn't fit books very well, but he loves it!"
2,Beware: Incorrect aspect ratio!,"The technical description and the DVD case itself both say this is 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, but this is not the case. The videos are 1.33:1 or widescreen footage embedded within a 1.33:1 screen.As for the music videos themselves, they are excellent."
4,I love watching these videos!,Many people mentioned that there are no special inserts or features other than random shuffle or changing the subtitles but I still enjoyed the product.
5,5 stars are not enough!,"As someone who has bought more guitar books than I'd care to admit (given my still limited ability!), I can recognise exceptional quality in an instructional book when I see (and hear) it. Chris Hunt has produced the best rhythm guitar book I have ever encountered. It has 55 examples which are usually 2-4 bars long (a few are longer) and 8 play-along tracks with just bass & drums for extended practice. Without a doubt, every lesson is a minor gem. The rhythms and chord voicings presented here are things you have heard on hundreds of classic R&B tracks, but I think any guitarist of any style can benefit from the wisdom that is distilled in these pages. The quality of production, execution and knowledge that Chris has shared is as good as it gets. It will save me a lot of money that I would have given to a teacher to learn all that is contained here. It deserves to become THE benchmark rhythm guitar text and a best seller that every guitarist should own."
3,"Carries a lot of power, breaks eventually","This is the only retractable USB cable that I can find that will carry enough power to charge my Axim x51v. For that, the cable works great. Unfortunately, I'm on my third cable in 3 years. I don't use it a lot, but the cable eventually will not retract. When this happens, the electrical connection is broken as well."
5,Organized,Great for travel. Quick and easy to use. This product utilizes a thick wire allowing for USB power to be used. Powers your external hard drive or other divices that require significant power. Because of this the rectractable USB cord is a little larger than I expected but no big deal.
2,"Like the item, but....","I selected this item because I liked the features displayed in the picture. Mainly, I liked the rubber tip and reset pin. What I got was a plastic tip and a pen. Moreover, the stylus tip unscrews easily for replacing the pen.... too easily. Sometimes the tip falls off in use! Delivery and price are positives. Delivery was very fast."
4,Great bilingual resource,"This book is well-written -- an easy read, and well-indexed. It is easy to search for information within it.What I liked most about it, is that is explained some of the most common bilingual education models. It tells their characteristics and their achievements.I wish it would have had more ideas of other types of models, but if you're looking for the most common & successful ones, I think you'll find them listed in here."
5,Great Buy,"When I saw this watch on Amazon I just had to buy it. It looked great and it had the Jordan emblem directly in the middle of the face of the watch. I have had the watch for a few months now and get complements about it wherever I go. It looks really nice in the sun and it seems to be holding up to the constant wearing pretty well. It wasn't hard to take out a few links either, allowing the watch to fit nicely on my wrist. And for the price I got it for...you can't beat it. A great buy!"
3,Catherine Westmoreland,It smells to heavy. It does not smell like the China Rain I have Purchased in the past with other brands. Sorry just to flowery for me. More on the musk side would be better scented and less flowery.
3,ok speaker,speakers sound ok but i had to resolder speaker leads because they were broken right out of box. Could have returned but i had a soldering iron.
5,"The best, bar none.","Modern Drummer is much more than a magazine about drummers; it's a magazine about DRUMMING. You simply can't find a better magazine that keeps you on top of everything drum-related. From new product reviews, to tuning techniques, to health columns about good playing posture and other drummer woes, to the well-written and informative articles, Modern Drummer is the best source of drumming information. Who knew that by reading a review with Godsmack's drummer, I'd learn that putting cotton balls in my floor tom is a great muffling technique? All music genres are covered in the magazine, with sheet music and guest columns from the world's greats showing how it's done.If you're a drummer, do yourself a favor and get a subscription today. You will value this magazine for the rest of your life."
4,If only they'd bring back Rick Van Horn,"It would be perfect! I've read every issue of this magazine, but occasionally let my subscription lapse. Now ""I'M BACK!"""
1,"Modern Drummer sans the ""Modern"" drummers!","I'll never forget when this magazine did a very small bit piece about Kevin Haskins, labeling him as an ""up and coming"" drummer. Of note, Kevin was one of the first drummers to effectively use electronics live and incorporate them as an instrument and not as an afterthought. He plays marimba (live) as well, so that makes him an official percussionist right? At the time the article appeared, Kevin had just completed his third album with the immensely popular group LOVE AND ROCKETS. Prior to that he cut like 7 albums as a member of the seminal and 'still-reigning' kings of Goth - BAUHAUS! Meanwhile no mention ever in this magazine of innovative GANG OF FOUR drummer Hugo Burnham. Yet we've had like 5 Niel Peart (luv ya Niel, don't get me wrong) and 3 Chad Wackerman interviews...needless to say I quit subscribing LONG AGO!!!David Scally - proud owner of early 70's Gretsch kits and brand spankin' new TAMA Starclassic Maples. All Zildjian."
1,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this pen, but I found writing with it more tiring than using a regular pen. I wish Pentel would bring back their Ergotwist pens. Those really were comfortable."
3,Arthritis Pen,This item was purchased for my 99 year old mother.She tried it but was unable to use it on a consistentbasis and never used it again.
4,Silver pen,"I bought this and the original pen in purple. I couldn't tell the difference except the price. Certanly good for athritic thumbs.As a writer, I will never use any other. It is getting quite a bit of attention in my writing class."
1,advice for parents,"We bought the Disney Princess set and it didn't work at all. We received the Barbie set and it seemed to work better when were close together, but when we moved more than 15 feet apart the sound was not coming through one receiver. Maybe ours is just defective.For Christmas we got our children the cheapest Uniden set from the electronics section of Walmart for about $18. It is 1000 times superior to any toy set. It has a 10 mile radius (supposedly) and multiple channels. When our daughters opened it they had no interest in it because they aren't pretty, but maybe that could be helped with stickers or even paint.DON'T BUY TOY WALKIE TALKIES, THEY NEVER WORK."
4,A quick fix for the hard to press talk button,"Like the other reviewers have noted, the push to talk button is hard for young kids to master. My husband though simply used an X-acto knife to cut through the soft plastic encasing (just follow the heart design) and voila problem solved. There a hard button underneath that our 4 year old daughter mastered the first time around and the walkie talkie has become a hit with her and all her friends when they come over."
1,aweful,"Just picked this up at Walmart. Talk button is impossible for little hands to push. No volume, no morse code. Same frequency as our Safety 1st baby monitor. Expensive button batteries. No reception on one of the units. Cost twice as much as a knock-off at Target we got that was much better!"
5,Fun product,It's a cool gift. I luv it. Shipped on time and well packed. The website is fun and reasonably priced.
4,Informative and helpful read,"Full of useful insight and information, and mid-depth analysis of racing mechanics. It helps to know some automotive lingo (I've had to look up a few words), but this is technical enough for the engineers to enjoy, yet written plainly enough that anyone can benefit from reading it."
4,Interesting toy,"My baby girl enjoys being in it, and we also have a kick-n-play baby gym by Fisher Price that we put in it for her to entertain herself. This item is good for travel since it can be put in a relatively small backpack that comes with it. But it is too expensive for what it has to offer and that is why I give it 3 stars only."
4,the squeaker is in the wrong spot,"the arms on the clock fell off and the squeaker in the center should be near the side. you can't lay flat wiht that in the middle. so my 3 yr old would get mad at it after a certain point. i rarely used it wiht my 2nd baby. she liked the mirror and the other side was enough to hold her attention for 20 minutes. the gym matt that i had with the bars of toys that hung over their heads kept her busy for hours on end. i would go wiht that over this one. storage wise it's a great product it has it's own bag to keep it in. it cleans well, and it kept them off the floors of houses we would visit wiht friends and family. so that was a defiante plus."
1,I would not recommend this,We bought this for my son when he was four months old. He will not lay on the mat for more than a couple of minutes. I definitely do not think that it is worth the money.
5,All around great toy,"Someone gave this to our baby daughter and at 3 months she loved it and when she was a few months older, she played more on the other side. There are so many activities! It really is good for travel too like someone else said. It is very educational and it is most useful as they are starting to turn over and move around, (3-5 months) because it keeps them inside at that age, so you don't have to worry. Now that she is 10 months, it still keeps her entertained."
4,warhol diaries,"Upon receiving this book, I am amazed at how warhol chronicled his life. many run ins with celebrities and the fact that he kept a record of all his small finances were surprising.Very interesting read and very informative of the life and times of the 1960'sthank you warhol for all the great art."
5,Interesting and entertaining,"This book highlights the contradictions that were Warhol. He was a winner/loser, daring/timid, a man who was an icon in the drug-crazed 60's and 70's, who never did a nonprescription drug himself. A man who epitimized the 60's generation who hated their parents...but Warhol lived with his mother. Warhol was unique, and that's what make these diaries worth reading."
4,Hip NY in the 70's and early 80's,"Andy Warhol knew everybody and left these brief diary entries over a period of years that coincided with the Studio 54 era of Jagger, Capote, Halston and countless other connected NY glitterati. The book is a fascinating look into Warhol's personal reflections on his friendships and the people involved in the scene at the time. It can be basically opened at random and read with enjoyment.Pretty cool stuff if you are interested in that period of NY cafe society."
1,"Overated, Boring, and Self Indulgent",This book is entirely overated. Warhol's prose is horrible considering the creative mind he posseses. I bought it used (thank God) and was bored to tears reading about taxi rides and what so-and-so was wearing. It was like reading a dreadfully boring gay man's blog. A bio on this character would be much more enlightening and a much less waste of time.
2,Anything BUT warfare,"This book is NOT what you'd expect. It has quite little information on strategy, weapons and all other ""military"" aspects, and 80% of the book is devoted to things such as size, pay and organization.If you want to find out about byzantine warfare, just read ""Strategykon"" of Mavrikios and ""Taktika"" of Nikephoros Phocas... (Last one is sold as ""Sowing the dragon's teeth"")."
4,The Met Bar's Worst Nightmare.,"The most un-trendy album of the year award goes to DCFC with no contest. The music seems more like an impromptu jam session while the lyrics are razor sharp. The vocal's are beautiful; Micheal John Sheehy's voice is a treasure and a secret well kept. They took alot of heat for the EP ""Perfect Piece of Trash"" but all amends are made here and now; highlights both emotionally and muscially are 'The Curse' and 'Steal Away'. This band deserves far more attention than they are getting -Give it to them."
3,Loved the Tone the Pedal Broke after three sessions,The tones out of this unit are awesome... But the Wah pedal broke on mine after three jam sessionsnot much quality there. I went on the Line 6 website and it would appear this is a known issue by line 6.I returned mine and went back to my old Digitech set up for now.
5,Incredibly versatile,This is amazing piece of equipment. Not too difficult to carry around and not too heavy either. The effects are very good for being digital. For those that play metal I really recommend you buy the metal pack that line 6 sells on their website since it's got some of the best metal tones I've ever heard even taking analog pedals into account.
1,Did not work,I bought this unit from Amazon and when it arrived the onboard computer did and would not work. Sent it back and bought another at local Guitar store.
3,Great feel but one poorly engineered function,"This pen has a comfortable feel. However, in my hand the angle of pen to paper (about 30 degrees) does not allow pen to produce a clean consistent line.Also, what appears to be a pocket clip has a very fragile tab that keeps pen open for writing. IT BROKE IN MINUTES. Tried using tape to keep it open. Returned all three pens one month ago. No reply as yet."
3,PenAgain,"This pen takes some getting used to and although I continue to use it, I'm not sure that I would recommend it. I also feel as if it should be a little longer..."
3,need to adjust,"Although the pen is indeed very comfortable to hold, leaving no tension on the hand, fingers or wrist areas, I think it takes some getting used to when putting it to paper. Amazon offers the best prices for those wanting to buy one to try it out."
2,John Freida Sheer Blonde Healthy Attitude Leave-In Spray 8 oz.,I liked the product although the bottle is defective . the Sprayer wont spray. I tried cleaning the nozzle and it just wont work. I put it in my hands and applied it. Like i said i liked not loved it. I probably wont buy it again
3,wall light bar,"This item arrived timely and without any damage. I was hesitant at first to order it as I am not fond of these type light bars. However the area that I needed to install it was small. I am utterly tickled with the overall look of the light. There are two drawbacks. You cannot use a regular 40 watt incandescent light bulb. You will need to use the smaller refrigertor type 40 watt bulbs. Lastly the light output is not great. It is a little on the dim side for a bathroom light fixture. Otherwise it is a good value, is well made and looks much more expensive than its cost. I am pleased."
4,A complex stick for complex games,"This stick requires some practice. The left hand works five buttons plus a throttle and a directional pad. The right hand work two buttons, a rocker switch, and a directional hat.The ergonomics are great overall. The gentle swoop for the left hand accomodates many hand sizes. The stick has a generous rest at the base. My one complaint is that the angle between the two sections is fairly acute. This in turn forces me to bring my elbows closer together than I like. I do, however, have broad shoulders; this may not be an issue for everyone.The notable omission from this stick is a twisting stick. I'm glad it's not there, but don't be surprised.This stick tries to be an all-around joystick--suitable for mech sims, flight sims, and FPSs. It pulls it off better than any other stick I have used."
2,Sadstick,"I have tried two of Gravis' joysticks. This one did not work any better than their cheaper one. After installing, it did not work as advertised. When I tried to get support, it took a week to get a response. Their response did not solve the problem. My impression was that they did not really care. I guess they sell enough of them, that one (or two) customers lost, does not matter. I will give joystick away if I can find a friend who wants it."
4,Gravis XT DC J/S,This Stick is fairly nice and works fairly well.I have not found any problems with mine yet.I would recomend this stick to anyone.
4,Guide to one of the premier Midwestern climbing areas,"One would never think of the Midwest as having any great climbing areas. While it isn't Yosemite or Joshua Tree, Devil's Lake in central Wisconsin is one of the country's best climbing spots. This guide details hundreds of great climbs in DL along with maps and climb ratings. Descriptions are short with some beta mixed in and the maps are little confusing. But since most of DL's climbing areas are hidden in the bluffs, the guide is an absolute must. It's also small enough to fit in a back pocket"
1,Very bad book: a waste of your money,"It is a heap op philosophy, not science. No formula, math, explanation, working examples whatsoever. Just small-talk to fill up the pages. This is NOT a physics book. I was lured into buying it thinking to get a complete textbook on Gödel's explanation of time. Forget it, this book is not worth your money. Go check the internet for PDF's or webpages containing the original publications of Gödel, they are there allright."
1,Bah. Hard to read if you don't have a degree in math,"I didn't finish the book. Could be my own mistake because I thought I would be able to digest the book better. I think it really helps if you have a degree in math and know all/most the people from more than 100 years ago better. Other than that, I would say this book is a waste of money. And I don't know why you arrived here in the first place, I was intrigued by the idea that there could be a universe without time(I got a feeling heaven is something like that). Well I'm still seeking as I was before reading the book:-)."
3,Does Time Exist?,"The argument is that when they define ""time"" people demand thatwhat is in the past is ""gone forever"", ""no longer accessible.""But since in general relativity it might at least be possible inprinciple to return to ANY arbitrary space-time point the suggestionis that WHAT PEOPLE MEAN BY ""time"" just doesn't exist.It seems to me, however, that people are constantly changing theirdefinitions and concepts. Science is just one thing that may causeus to change our concepts and definitions. I would simply take timeto be an ordering but admit that a cyclic time might be acceptable.(Such a view of time was already to be found in some eastern religions.)A better argument for the nonexistence of time is Barbour's (The End ofTime)."
1,Don't think it's from the Cape.,"I normally love the RykoDisc releases but this 20 year old sound effect cd doesn't sound like much of anything that I know from the Cape. Even the photo on the fron looks ""off-Cape.""Overall the sound quality is decent and I like the no-music ethic, however, there are better and more recent ones out there. If you're looking for Cape sounds this budget disc isn't all it's cracked up to be. However, if you're looking for just a brook, it's an ok product."
2,Too much wrong...,"This has the potential to be a real unique and useful product. 2 video inputs, 1 SVGA, 1 SVHS, and a touch screen to boot.There was one ""bright"" pixel upon turn on. Video inputs and VGA worked well. This is made in China and the translated manual is not good. The website you're told to go to for new drivers (Which you will need because the originals locked up the computer (XP SP2)) are in Chinese... not so bad until you click on the ""English"" icon and the ""404, not found"" (also in Chinese) displays. You have to click on icons until you find the correct ""English"" URL, it's there, you have to perform trial and error to find it. These loaded the correct touchpad drivers (not signed for XP, but seem to work ok). I've had the monitor for a day and will have installed in the car for DVD's and Computer GPS tomorrow. I hope it's robust enough for that environment. It does come with a lighter attachment for 12v use. fingers crossed."
1,LSU is ALWAYS overrated!!,"Everthing about this product is really cool, except for the awful Purple and Yellow colors, not to mention the obnoxious Tiger mascot - Real Original LSWho.I bought this item for a good friend who lost his way."
5,quality! dont leave yourself stranded,"this is an absolute pain in the neck (and knuckles, and back) to install! but thats the civic's fault, not this alternator's fault (p.s. there's a bolt below and kind-of-behind the alternator, that will allow you to loosen the lower bracket and save you time that i didn't!) but this alternator is a very good piece, AND no core charge! (so rebuild your old alternator as a spare)you cant beat it for the price"
5,KING OF ROCK AND ROLL!,I love this album. It is my favorite. People listening to it think it is Elvis Costello. I explain that it is better than Elvis Costello. Jason Lyyn Crigler should be crowned the king of rock and roll. Monica should be the queen. Of this I am sure.Rock on!
3,There are other better choices,"Bruce Lipton's ideas deserve 5 stars+. He is one of the most engaging presenters with enlightening and very relevant ideas. He really uses Powerpoint slides and animations as VISUAL aids in contrast to so many who just give verbal texts on the slides and read them to you.But this dated interview in a chair is not Bruce at his best. It is better to read his book, The Biology of Belief (cf. reviews there), or get his other DVDs, such as The New Biology. If you had the chance, listen to him in person. It will be a very worthwhile experience."
1,Not what I thought,"This is a really old and unscripted TV interview and wasn't really what I was looking for. It was not properly described in the ad, by omission mainly, to the point of deception. I have other Bruce Lipton presentations and know his format and presentation style but this is really low quality and certainly not worth the huge price tag.It seems to be trading on Bruce's curent reputation to flog off old rubbish.David Allen"
3,Can we say... generic?,"Yeah... I got this book as kind of a last resort, because the actual book about Dean that I wanted, wasn't available. Near the beginning of the book, when they are talking about his childhood, there are at least 5 pages about the times in which Dean grew up. I didn't buy this book to read about the History of Indiana."
2,WHY?,"This CD was a huge disappointment to me. I bought the CD on the recommendation of a close friend. The CD opens up with one of the best tracks on the CD, with a nice bouncey bass line and very nice samples and layering. You might even notice the reference to an old-school drum n bass track, <aka: jungle>, ""Night Of The Living Dead"", which is on Speed Limit 140+ BPMs.Then the album degenerates into a mish mosh of ambience and noise with beats that flitter this way and that. After repeated listens, I was able to dig up 2 more tracks that were acceptable. They didn't blow me away and this CD remains basically an EP to me. A CD with 3 tracks and filler.Only the true abstract fan can enjoy this, because there's very little to grasp on to when listening."
1,Not satisfied,A few years ago I purchased an Umbra aluminum shoe horn for my husband and the quality was exceptional. He loves it. Last month I purchased the same shoe horn for my son and the quality is not up to standard. The machining of the shoe horn is poor workmanship and there are some bad edges. It looks like an unskilled worker made it. I can see the difference in the quality of the one I purchased a few years ago compared to the one purchased last month. Maybe I am too fussy but for the price I paid I expected better quality. The only reason I kept it is because it is too much trouble to return it.
5,Loved it!,"I was satisfied within 5 seconds when i used this product! Perfect for vertical hair hold, i would recommend it to anyone"
2,Defective AND Gross... Will not buy again!,"I've been using this product for years, and have liked it a lot actually. However, I recently purchased a bottle and found it defective. Normally, this hair product is like a gooey paste or glue (as the name implies). The bottle I had came out with a clear liquid, epoxy-like slime mixed with the glue. It's gross, unmanageable, and unusable as a hair product.After contacting Got2B through their website, describing the above... they responded 5 days later with an automated email saying I did not ""provide enough information"" and should call their phone support. Pardon me? After all, I went out of my way to inform them of a product defect. I sent them another email saying this is unacceptable and would return the defect. product to my retailer, and switch to another brand (I've had good experience with that ICE stuff)"

5,Good product,"Excellent and good product. Sticky and Spiking for a whole day, even walking in the rain for less than 10 seconds. Feels like you put the glue on the head.I use able 3 of them almost. And Walgreen sales this for $7 per."
3,sweeper,"Cheaply made handle.Handle is out of proportion to a bottom sweeper.I am afraid that one of these days, this handle will crack.to put it back together, you'll need a welder.Up to date sweeper works ok on small jobs"
1,sluggish sounding swing,"I guess there's only one wrd that can describe this cd and that word is SLUGGISH, this is undanceable swing, it seems these msuicians have no drive whatsoever. I agree with the other reviewers lame & boring!"
2,A little too generic,"Though they do swing lightly, this band is just too generic sounding, and there are NO solos, whoever arranged these doesn't know how to arrange, there ought to be at least one horn solo!"
5,Powerful and Moving,"Mr. Guiles again gives an in-depth and touching, personal, human side in his biography of Marilyn Monroe. I highly recommend this book, and all his Hollywood biographies to anyone who wants to learn about the story behind the famous and beautiful faces on the silver screen."
2,Wasn't that good,"I am Marilyn fan and I have read a few books this one was okay it was more focused on her movies but it was okay still my favorites, I recommend for Marilyn fans are the best one is from Barbara Leaming it was a gift from my sister very good book with GREAT pictures,then Marilyn Monroe Confidential by Lena Pepitone and William Stadiem and finally ""My story"" by Andrea Dworkin."
1,Only good for beginners,This book is only good if you have never stepped foot in a gym. More than half the exercises are longer than 60 min and no mention of diet.
5,Let's Start Talking,"This book is a complete guide for preparation for a Let's Start Talking mission trip. You will learn how to simply share your faith by letting God's Word do the teaching. This approach to people opens doors and replaces the ""pushy religious"" pitch with true bonds of loving friendship. If you are reading this, you have a skill that is highly valued across the world--you speak English. Sharing that skill is a huge blessing to many in the world who are trying to improve their livelihood.If you are considering a first trip, I wholeheartedly encourage you. You will be changed, and you will bring life-giving change to others. You will come away with friendships for a lifetime.I referred to this book often as I prepared for my trip, and as I encountered new situations. I shared copies with others who were considering going so that they could get a realistic idea of the work before they committed."
2,"If this is leather, I'm Napolean.",Everything about the shoe looks cheap. I used to wear superstars back in the 1960's. I loved them. Tremendous quality. They could take a howitzer and keep on going. A pea shooter would knock these out.
3,Disappointed...,"It's kind of a disappointment piece because both DVDs only contain music videos, and that's about it--and not even all of the videos Gackt's had done in the past 6-7 years either. It could have, at least, had him talking about his journal or something. No Gactk talking at all. I still love Gackt, though. But you can find all of those music videos on YouTube easily."
5,DVD Review,"The DVD came in good condition and it worked.I suggest any Gackt fans who love his music and videosthis is good to purchase, has a variety of his songs and they're worth watching."
4,Love the videos!,"I saw complaints about the screen size, sound quality and casing but it plays great on my tv. I love watching these music videos and having english subtitles is awesome! :)) Gackt has an amazing voice! This was a good purchase."
1,I can't see that.,&#51060;&#44148; &#53944;&#47000;&#53433;&#45336;&#48260;&#44032; &#46888;&#51656; &#50506;&#50500;&#49436; &#48176;&#45824;&#51648; &#49888;&#52397;&#54624;&#46412; &#47803;&#50044;&#45908;&#45768; &#46020;&#45824;&#52404; &#50612;&#46364;&#44052;&#45716;&#51648; &#52286;&#51012;&#49688;&#44032; &#50630;&#50612;&#49436; &#44228;&#49328;&#47564; &#46104;&#44256; &#44396;&#44221;&#46020; &#47803;&#54664;&#51020;. &#50612;&#46356;&#44032;&#49436; &#52286;&#51012;&#49688; &#51080;&#51012;&#44620;&#50836; &#12640;&#12640; &#52286;&#50500;&#51452;&#49464;&#50836;
3,Lack of finish is disappointing,"This is a fine spatula for the money but if you think you're getting a crazy deal for a brand that is normally premium-priced, you will be disappointed. The wood handle is completely unfinished and hence is not protected from stains or water damage. Water will raise the grain causing it to be uneven and rough. Tomato, wine, etc. will surely stain the handle if allowed to absorb.I was able to address this problem by sanding the surface slightly with fine sandpaper, then treating it with butcher block conditioner. I usedHoward BBC012 Butcher Block Conditioner Food Grade Mineral Oil and Natural Waxes, 12-Ounces, but any kind of food grade wax, oil or combination thereof would probably be fine. As a bonus, the oil brings out the grain and darkens the handle slightly, improving the look in my opinion."
5,Works just fine,The Spatula is all it needs to be. I wanted a smaller one that won't self destruct and this has fit the bill!
1,dont get it,It is cheap for a reason. didnt work at all. they refunded me pretty quick so it must be a normal thing. dont waste your time.
1,Terrible Product,"This is a terrible product. I must have over looked the reviews on it. I plugged it in and within seconds of charging I heard a snap. After opening it up I found that a part on the circut board literally exploded.I guess that is why they are selling it for a dollar. I wasted my dollar, don't waste yours!!!"
1,Does not work.,"This charger does not work. Eforcity has good customer service but they sell this bad product. The first one they sent didn't work, so they sent me another one free of charge, but it didn't work either."
4,This is a good Monitor *WHEN IT WORKS*,"Be carefull-a VERY large number of these had capacitor problems.The unit may work for a few hours-or weeks or even months, then will go bad, sometimes intermittantly, manifested by colored vertical lines on an otherwise blank white screen.SONY at first denied the problem, then sent eveyone a REFURBISHED model.BEWARE!Some may try to sell you a unit that works only FOR THE MOMENT, thus cheating you or else the Post Office for ""shipping damage"".Others will try to sell you a ""Refurbished"" Model NOT fixed by SONY.When it works, this is a great monitor-and the built-in speakers are a great convenience..."
4,Toby the Tabby Kitten,This is a good book to get if you want to learn about kittens especially Tabby's or a Manx. It has really cute pictures. It's interesting because it talks about how kittens grow. It tells you what to do and what not to do and about their nature.
3,Lion King 2: Matthew Broderick Has Bills to Pay,"Don't get me wrong, the kids will love it. There's lots of Simba, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa so they will be perfectly happy. The animation is fairly standard direct to video fair, as are the musical productions. It's not bad, and if it didn't have The Lion King to be compared to, it would seem better, but that movie is a very hard act to follow. The story is compelling, but feels kind of shoehorned in with the first since since suddenly Scar has a mate and a family, and that wasn't mentioned in the first. Zeira is over the top evil, more than Scar even IMO, since Scar was power-mad and Zeira just lives for murder and strife. That might be a little more difficult to explain to perceptive children since Scar could be framed as extremely selfish, but Zeria is just a ball of seething hatred and bloodlust."
5,Good comfort,This was a great pick. It is very comfortable worn on your back and there is plenty of room for your essentials. The removable water container is a plus.
5,LA Times Book Prize Finalist,"A stunning example of what happens when a writer of literary fiction pulls parts of several genres into one compelling piece. Living Dead Girl is such a poetic and heartbreaking book -- equal parts mystery novel, character piece, literary novel and unreliable narration exercise -- and Goldberg was well deserving of his recent nomination for the LA Times Book Prize. Unlike his previous book, Fake Liar Cheat, which was a funny noirish romp through LA aimed at the MTV generation, Living Dead Girl is a serious look into the human condition and what happens when love dies. This is one of those books that should have been a bestseller -- maybe it will be in paperback."
2,Why can't Midland make durable batteries?,"The NiMH batteries that Midland supplies with these radios have deplorable life cycles. They're like the poster child for planned obsolescence, designed to fade after even minimal use or standby. Ridiculous. And the aftermarket is no better, so you suck it up and either use alkalines, or some use the rechargeable AA's. No panacea, however."
1,equus 6069 tachometer,"Poor quality,green contact/wire missing discarded product and will order autometer tachometer from another source.Equus 6068 Black Tachometer - Measures 3 3/8-Inches"
4,Sorrowful Songs,"This is the first CD by Allison Moorer that I have listened to. She clearly has personal experience with depression and sings and writes about it beautifully. The songs are of different styles and tempos. Wonderful in expressing her feelings. I thought it was excellent, but sad."
4,One Star Short...,"This knife was ALMOST perfect. I loved the fact that the blade is AUS-8, meaning it holds its edge pretty well. Unfortunately for me, though, it did not come with a very sharp edge at all and that is my only qualm(I had the same issue with the M16-14D that I had bought earlier that year...). I have also had trouble putting an edge on it, the CRKT Slidesharp failed me... But apart from my little edge problem I have been nothing but satisfied with it. It is not too big that you can't keep it in your pocket comfortably and it is not too small that it will not perform difficult tasks well. The opening system and AUTO-LAWKS are awesome. Just with a flick of you finger you have that bad boy ready for action. The locking mechanism then keeps it tight and sturdy, making it feel practically like a fixed blade. Get this guy sharp and he is a force to be reckoned with."
2,What a disappointment!,"The first four stories in this anthology are great. I especially loved ""If Only in My Dreams"" by Mariah Stewart. Because the majority of the stories are exceptional, I gave this book two stars even though the last story was bad enough that I was tempted to give just one.""White Out"" by Linda Howard was the major disappointment. The story is so raunchy that I couldn't finish it. When the first ""meeting"" between the ""hero"" and ""heroine"" is sexual intercourse, you know the story isn't worth finishing. I really tried to continue, but when Price and Hope were right back at it as soon as Price regained full consciousness, I gave up. Pass the air sickness bag, please. There's nothing romantic about casual sex."
1,just skip this,"I agree quite thoroughly with the reviewers who expressed extreme dislike for Linda Howard's ""White Out."" It was sickening. Some of us read romance for the romance, not for explicit descriptions of sexual relationships which begin before the hero (and I use the term loosely) is even conscious.As for the rest, Jude Deveraux's hero is a paternalistic town despot. Margaret Allison and Mariah Stewart tell fairly ho-hum stories about creative, artsy types going home and falling in love, one with a (supposedly) unconventional doctor and the other with her first love, with whom she had lost touch through a lame misunderstanding--don't you just hate it when these people don't TALK to each other?The star goes to Stef Ann Holm for ""Jolly Holly""; though not a total classic, this story does introduce a handful of very memorable minor characters, especially an intriguing couple of ""elves"" named Yule and Tide."
3,A tale of rural India that fails to capture the imagination,"Narayan does an excellent job of depicting rural life in India, in all social classes, in the mid-twentieth century, and this tale of an engaging but flawed protagonist whose life takes unusual turns is reasonably readable.However, the narrative style seems slow and oddly detached. Perhaps Narayan wanted it to be plain, straightforward, and hypnotic. But it comes across as simplistic and even a bit superficial.The ending is dramatic and is one point in which Narayan's narrative strategy succeeds. But much of the book could have been told in a much more sprightly and nuanced manner."
3,I used it for Langauge Arts but not much else.,"It was a good read considering it was for school, however it wasn't a book that i would enjoy reading in my spare time."
1,Reizen Portable Telephone Amplifier (30dB) good idea bad design,"The description of the product should have indicated that it was designed for the older style telephone earpiece,(concave). But even trying that type earpiece the device still was incapable of producing more volume into the ear, let alone making the speech understandable. ALSO, I've tried to reach customer service for return of this product for refund, but have been unsuccessful."
3,Will work on a budget,I bought this Telephone Amplifier for my 82 year old mother who was having trouble hearing some people on her phone. When I first got it I didn't think much of it but really for the money it does work for her. She has a problem as far as turning if off every time and as a result it runs the batery down. It takes a little bit longer for her to answer the phone because she is turning it on. Check the ear piece on the phone your going to put it on to make sure it has a big enough dip in the ear piece for the rounded back of the ampifier to fit in. Over all I'm satisfied for the price I paid. If you have more money to spend I would sudgest buying a new phone with higher amplification for the hearing impaired.
1,Don't buy this product,"This product is not working at all. Do not buy this product, it is a waste of money. The sound is not clear, it is impossible to understand any words. It is not functioning with or without hearing aids. There is a constant whistling sound in the background."
2,Wisconsin Logging,"The product is exactly what I wanted. However it is a book of things that have passed, and of a particular area of Wisconsin which many people do not even know exists. I have been hunting this area since 1947 and know it quite well. The area was logged off from the 1800's to the early 1900's.I have seen old White Pine stumps which measure really close to four feet in diameter. Their wounder is gone now, but seeing these relics brings goose bumps to a person, their specter lives on in the deep North Woods.There are other books, ""Daylight in the Swamp"". Don --------------------------------------------------------------------"
2,Running on Empty,"This series has run down and is sputtering on a near empty tank. More and more padding, an emphasis on an obvious plot point, excessive back story on characters, a teaser for a not-very-interesting plot thread that started in an earlier book and is left dangling here - they all add up to a disappointing read. Apparently aware of the problems the author tried to deal with them in a forward, but really, it is time for China to close up the old herb shop."
3,A solid read,"I had a hard time getting into the rhythm of this one. I found it a little jarring with the way Ms. Albert caught readers up on the backstory. I don't know how she could have done it more effectively. That said, I did appreciate her refreshing my memory. Once I got beyond that, Spanish Dagger was an enjoyable read. I also missed the interaction of China with her family and their daily routines but it was a nice change of pace to learn more about Sheila. Ms. Albert is meticulous in her research and reading one of her novels is not only entertaining but informative. I would have liked just a little more of the storyline with China's half brother but I'm sure that will be the next installment. Three stars for a good solid read."
3,No more cross-cutting please!!!,"Oh where oh where has China Bayles gone? I agree with the other 2- and 3-star reviewers: Albert needs to revive the franchise by writing well. The gathering of yucca for papermaking was perfunctory and not a plot device; who needed it? In ""Indigo Dying,"" the herb gathering was part of the setting, the festival in town. The books work better when the herbs aren't afterthoughts."
3,Great info on plants,"I can't say I like the busybody characters or the mawkish female bonding, but the info on Yucca plants and some of the recipes made the book worth reading. After getting a copy from the library I ordered one for myself just to keep the info on hand! Must say, Rambo was the best character in the book, with Howard running a close second."
3,Is it just my disk or everyone have issue on trueHD?,"I just got my copy last night and watched it immediately. And I have big problem with the trueHD. When I using trueHD japanese vocal, it has a few instance that no sound at all for a few sec. Then when I listen to trueHD english, no more sound completely after Kshatriya fight with the heavy amour Jegen. It happened on both my Oppo BD-83 and PS3 and I never have problem with any other disks with my setup (Oppo bd player + Elite AVR). So is it just my disk or everyone have the same problem? can I ask amazon replace me with a new one?"
3,A little taste of the past...,"Forget your limp wristed fan boy emo-in' from double zero'd out. Relive the classic tales of old with this new series. It's a bit pricey for just one episode though, but I'll give this one a chance. Depending on what I see in the next will make my final decision on the full worth."
1,So wheres the DVD Format for this,"seeing as the rest of the world got this on both Blu Ray and DVD, but only the US got this only on Blu Ray, not everyone here can either afford a Blu Ray Player unless you own a PS3 or afford a HD TV"
5,A must see anime,"This is a must see gundam anime.Even though it has only 2 episodes,it starts off good.The anime graphics are very good in detail.It makes you wander how the next dvd is going to be.The story line is also pretty good.I would tell anyone to get this gundam anime and start getting the whole series.It would worth it."
4,"Finally, back to the Universal Century","Brilliant. After years of of angst Gundam-like creations (Wing, 00, Seed) we finally get to see a new chapter of the original Gundam universe. The animation is top notch, the mechanical designs are fantastic, and the English cast isn't annoying. A shame that this title clocks in under sixty minutes and that there are zero extras on the disc. I would recommend watching the first three Gundam movies, Zeta Gundam, and Char's Counterattack to get some background to the universe if you aren't familiar with this series. A must buy for any self respecting mecha fan.If there were extra included with the disk, this would have been a five star rating."
2,We were disappointed with this toy,"We got this toy for our daughter when she was 11 months old and we were going on vacation. She loves keys and phones and steering wheels, but for some reason this toy never did really interest her. For one thing it is very difficult to play with while sitting in a carseat. She kept pushing it over the side, and I couldn't get it positioned well so that she could reach it. Even when it was on the floor, though, she didn't play with it. I finally put it up in the closet. A few days ago, she discovered it again (she's 21 months now) and wanted to play with it. She looks at it for 3-4 minutes at a time and then is through with it. It was a pricey toy and definitely was not worth the money for us.The one good thing I can say about it is that if you can get it positioned well, it really could be a good car toy because all the pieces are soft. I think for our daughter, though, it just didn't look realistic enough for her to be interested."
2,Too expensive,In general this was an ok product. It was too big clumsy for the car but my son liked to play with it in the house. It would be a good buy at $15 but no more than that.
1,Glad I didn't pay full price,"I actually found this at Marshall's for a lot cheaper and was glad since my child rarely wanted anything to do with it. I got it to help entertain him in the car ~11 months but it only frustrated him with the poor attchment sites. He kicked it off quickly. At home, as he has gotten older, he occasionally picks up the phone to ""talk"" on it but since there are few noises, he got bored quickly. He's almost two and it just kept collecting dog hair and dust on it. I tried attaching it in his crib which secured better but he ripped it off too. Overall I would not recommend it for the car and most kids probably would get bored with it too. We'll see when my second arrives this year."
3,Let them drive,"I bought this as a way to let my son ""help"" me drive the truck. He used it a lot when he was two - at three he uses it infrequently but he still likes it. I like toys that don't require batteries and this one fits the bill. It's a nice soft toy for a vehicle (in case your child is prone to launching items)It is also great for cushioning the dash and windshield when I am buying long boards that need to rest on my dashboard:) My son is pretty tough with it and it has stood up to his punishing ways."
3,Good imitation,These recordings are exact copies of original jazz band classics. I was almost fooled by the Woody Herman pieces. Very skillfully done. But who needs it? The originals are readily available on cd.
5,A Title Too Good to Ignore,"The title's mental image is so intriguing (almost like contemplating, ""what is the sound of Snow Falling on Snow""!) that I just had to take this book as one of my companions for a two-month sojourn in a snow-bound mountain cabin. Dr. Wicks' series of brief, mostly single-paragraph, thought-provoking vignettes centers on four themes: Experiencing the Lord, Availability, Clarity and Ordinariness. Each vignette provides focus for thoughtful, spiritual contemplation (ideally while gazing from a cozy cabin onto a landscape of snow falling on snow!). Nothing earth-shaking, but useful and worthwhile nonetheless. Recommended especially for those preparing for a spiritual retreat or pilgrimage."
5,As advertised,"We have a roof with a huge area. Part of two slopes comes together on the walk outside the front door (not great architectural design) and when it rained hard, we had a shower overflowing from the gutter. This flooded the walk and washed out the garden bed underneath the waterfall.Bought these from Amazon b/c the local big box hardware store only had the product in the color brown - we wanted white. Used one and installed it in about 3 minutes. A power screwdriver and a few metal screws was all that it took.It has rained several times since the install. My waterfall is gone, so the Gusher Guard gets an A+ grade from me!"
5,good stuff,You don't have to screw it to the gutter. Just push it under the gutter guard mesh if you have one. You would like to take it off anyway when snow raking the roof in winter. Delivery was very quick.
4,"Ok, I think","As soon as I installed the Gusher Guards, it quit raining. They have been, just, what the doctor ordered on other homes."
3,For true gourmet only,"This book is not for those who are looking for a quick and simple dinner after a hard day's work. It's best to use this book for special occasions - like birthday - if you spend it alone. Ok, maybe it's for regular days too if you are an experienced cook who can't live w/o great good. The color photos are beautiful but the ingredient lists may scare you. This is a thin book with not many recipes."
3,For the advanced user,"This is a very thorough book that contains several recipes I look forward to trying. Be advised, however, that the book is written with the British chef in mind - many vegetables are referred to by names your average US citizen is not familiar with (mange touts, pulses). Additionally, many ingredients are indicated by weight, which in combination with the complexity of some of the recipies, makes this a book better suited to the somewhat dedicated cook, rather than your average individual interested in eating properly without companionship."
4,pretty good!,"The recipes are all very carefully planned and delicious.Unfortunately, some of the ingredients are very hard to find.It is good to have it handy when you have guest over, because the meals are not only delicous, but also very attractive looking and smell lovely."
1,Boasts more than it does,"We returned the UMAX 3450 because it (the company) boasts more than this scanner can perform. First, as we found and as website reviews confirm, the UMAX 3450 CANNOT SCAN negatives. Every attempt produced horrible results! Second, reaching their technical support is a joke. Our guess is that the company must be on the brink of bankruptcy. After waiting OVER 1/2 hour on a NON-toll free call accompanied by continual promises that ""the wait will be no longer than 3 minutes"", that ""only a moment longer"", that ""someone will be right with you"" we finally hung-up. Frankly we felt duped. We don't ever wish to hear the word ""UMAX"" again and are sorry that ...(the website) sells their products."
1,"Despite the description, Mac isn't supported.","The ASTRAs are alright scanners, as is this one. But don't be fooled into thinking it will work with a Mac by the description. UMAX has announced they will never support OSX for these scanners. So You have to run a clunky scanner utility in os9 to get it to work and switch back and forth between OS's This is my third UMAX scanner, and my last one."
2,Don't expect customer service from UMAX,"Spent a couple of months e-mailing, calling and never got customer service. The phone just rings and rings. E-mails nevered answered and that was almost 10 months ago. I fixed it by unplugging unit over night and repluging it in after it just quit working.Software is user complicated and unfriendly."
2,Under Construction Puzzle,Received puzzle in new condition- battery was dead. Difficult to put in new battery but once done then the sounds of the different machines pretty much sound alike. Not a toy/puzzle that I would purchase again.
5,An excellent brief book.,"A great concept for a series, I have read several of these album-books, and particularly enjoy the diversity of prose. ""Ramones"" is one of my favorite albums by one of my favorite bands. Nicholas Rombes describes the zeitgeist of the mid-late 70s with his book. Unlike so many boring books and films about the era, Nicolas does not default to hyperbole about punk saving the universe. Instead, the author paints a picture of why The Ramones were an interesting band and how they fit in to the cultural landscape of the 70s. I started reading this on a plane and found myself devouring it within a couple hours and wished that it kept going. I got the sense that the author has a deep appreciation for this simultaneously perfect and flawed band, and put a great deal of heart behind each paragraph. I don't know anything about Nicholas Rombes, but I sure hope he continues writing!"
1,1-2-3-Poor,"There are so many wonderful books in the 33 1/3 series. This isn't one of them. Crushingly repetitive, this essay about the 70s punk scene offers little beyond name-dropping, back-patting and self-indulgence. To paraphase a quote from the book: ""There's nothing going in, there's nothing coming out."" Oh, and did I mention that maybe 20 percent of the book is actually about the songs on the Ramones' debut album. You'll find out just as much about Lester Bangs. May as well put him on the cover. Just rancid."
4,100 Page Term Paper on Ramones!,"I guess one of the beauties of the 33 1/3 series is that they are all just a bit different in content and format. The edition about *Master of Reality* was miles away from the one about *Double Nickels on the Dime* and both were terrific. Having said that I need to say I like the record much more than the book in this instance (Ramones). Well, who wouldn't like the record better than a book about the record - dancing about architecture - blah blah blah - yada yada yada. It was fun, however, to read a hundred page term paper with lot of academic theory blended with unabashed fandom about an album I've simply been listening to for the past 30+ years."
3,Not a bad read but little is about the album,"Barely a third of the book's 106 pages are devoted to an in-depth discussion of the Ramones' debut album, ""Ramones."" The rest of the book is devoted to the early history of the punk movement in the US (and New York City in particular) and a fairly academic discussion of what the term ""punk"" meant in the mid-70's versus what it came to mean later.This book is an interesting read, but I'm giving it a 3-star rating because, unlike many other titles in the 33 1/3 series, it is NOT primarily focused on the album it is devoted to."
5,Real dude here,I litened to some interviews of Plies on youtube and I was supprised how smart this guy is he really is a real down to earth dude. Listening to his cd he really thows what he sees all his pain right in your face he don't hold anything back. This cd is for the streets.
3,I like it.....,"LEt me tell you first. I judge rappers on their own merit. YOu can't compare Plies to any of the greats and if you expected his first CD to be up to par with the greats then that's on you for being an idiot.........ANy who, I liked the album. The beats were worthy and the rhymes were cool. Now, he is talking about a lot hustleing and banging hoes..but then again how old is PLies, aint that what he is supposed to be talking about?Anyway, I'll support a sophmore effort because The Real Testament gets a lot of play on the IPOD."
4,Real Talk this is Real Street Music,"I like this cat alot, he is really putting down some real topics. The song that hit me the most is about doing his mama wrong. I mean he talking about what he doing in the streets knowing he is wrong but his mother still sees him as her child. How real is that? Also the the song about he and his girlfriend get into a fight and he says lets screw and forgive each other. How many people have done that in real life. Alot of good sex comes after big arguements. That stuff is the truth. This is like i said before some Real Street Music. My hat goes off to Plies."
4,the realest cd out right now what the streets needed,This cd is straight hood ive been keepin a close eye on this guy and he the next hood mayor he keeps it real at all times in every song he what you call a full blodded goon!
3,a decent cd,"the cd is far from flawless but plies does deliver some uniqe material. i would say half the album is filler material but ther are some good songs. shawty is one of the biggest hits right now and a great combination of t-pains smooth singin and plies rough lyrics. hypnotized is another good one with akon on the hook and beat. my favorite would have to be runnin my momma crazy. this is the first good song ive heard of this type, where plies lyrics are flawless and complimented by some decent production. others that were decent are i am the club, money straight, and goons lurkin. the rest are just poor production filler material. plies wanted to make himself known and with his raunchy, hardcore street lyrics, i think he does just that"
1,you want real gangster rap skip this,"scc, scargface, wc, mc eiht, spice 1, brotha lynch, c bo is hard but this is just morte trash get this to hear akon, and t pain sing the hoks if nothing more."
1,bad poetry to bad music,the only talent demonstrated on this album is the artist's unique gift of being offensive and angry.... bad poetry to bad music.
2,EHH..DISAPPOINTED,With all of the hype around Piles i thought that this CD was gonna be hot. It wasnt even close. The only song that i like is the song about his mother just because of my brothers past. i used to like shwaty but it is played out now. Dont waste your money on this lame CD.
4,"Fox Presents Fortune Star, Uncut","This is in response to the Feb. 5th review titled ""ORIGINAL IS BETTER~!""While I agree with the message, it was put the wrong place. While in most cases the R1 releases of Hong Kong films are heavily cut and dubbed, these releases by Fox, are actually done by the fantastic HK company Fortune Star, and only released under Fox. They contain the UNCUT film in the original Cantonese language (DTS too!), as well as the English dub. As usual the picture quality is more than fantastic. The only downpoints are the usual Fortune Star downpoints: Hardly-to-no extras, and slightly edited sound fx,(but in this case no original mono sound). Also the subtitles are actually dubtitles, but are not terrible. In all, this is still one of the better versions of this film on DVD, especially for under $10.PS. As for the argument that ""no other countries have their own cuts, like France,"" maybe you should look into Luc Besson's distribution of Asian (especially Thai) films."
4,Touching,"I watched this as ""The First Mission"" too. I was pleasantly surprised as the acting skills of Jackie Chan & Sammo Hung was broght to the fore. This is more of an emotional drama than the regular Jackie Chan action flicks. However there's still enough fight scenes for the martial arts fan."
3,Dramatic film,"This Jackie Chan film is dramatic. There is little comedic material. When Sammo Hung's character is getting tutored, it's frustrating to see the tutor shout at him. To their credit, Sammo never launches into kung fu mode. He pretty much does a good job as a mentally challenged person. This film was different from what I expected. Jackie uses guns in this film."
3,"Close,but no cigar","Jackie and his friend Sammo Hung try to tackle a serious subject,and fall short.The story is touching,but I hate to say this the acting is over done.This could have been a much better movie if Jackie and Samo didn't try so hard.The story is about a young man(Chan) who has the responsability of taking care of his mentally challenged brother(Hung)it is endearing and touched on all of the difficult issues that would arise in such a situation,unfortunatly the dramatics are just way over the top and,I hate to say this,make Chan and Hung look pretty bad when it comes to being dramatic actors.Not bad for a one evening rental just out of curiosity,but nothing I would buy for my library.Check out ""Who Am I""or ""First Strike"" and you will be much happier.Chan fans will be dissapointed.Nice try guys,but no cigar!"
1,"serious drama, atypical Chan movie","This movie pairs Jackie up with his 'big brother', Samo Hung. They play brothers in the film, not much unlike Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in Rainman. There is very little action in this movie, it is more of a drama. In fact, I don't even think Jackie cracks a smile once in this movie- it is kind of a tear-jerker, relying more on acting than action. If you are looking for the typical Jackie Chan comedy and action, look elsewhere. It is worth having if you are huge fan, however."
1,Far from his best.,"Although this movie way enjoyed by many people, I cannot be one to share in that class. Jackie was made for action and will always be made for action. There acting was far from his best and the ""emotional"" scenes were more insulting to the audience then heartbreaking. If your a Jackie Chan fan, see it once. If not, don't look twice."
4,One of the Best Movies to Come Out of Hong Kong,"Very few Hong Kong movies rate four stars or more, and this is one of the very few. It is probably the most touching Hong Kong-made movie that I have ever seen. I saw it when it came out in theaters in Chinatown in 1986, and later over and over on tape. Sammo's non-fighting role is a refreshing break from his usual roles. His hairdo and dress complement his acting well and make his role compelling. Jackie is, well, Jackie. Although the translators did a decent job of dubbing in the English, one really has to see it in its original Chinese to fully comprehend the attitudes of everyday Hong Kong people."
2,Heart of Dragon,This was a sad movie for me and I couldn't watch it. Sammo playing a mentally challenged person and Jackie as his brother. I had to send this back. I'm sure it is a fine movie but it was too hard for me to watch.
3,"Very Good, But Something Missing","This was one of the most touching Hong Kong movies I have ever seen. It is enough to bring one to the verge of tears at times.The extras included in the DVD, like the music video, are certainly welcomed. But after having seen the longer version on tape (which included scenes that the theater and DVD versions lacked), I felt that something was missing, and so lowered my rating for the DVD. (Also missing was the gag reel/end credits that are so common to Hong Kong films.)"
4,"short summary, pros and whose in it","truly a very wonderful drama film with good actions in the tradition of 'rainman' where jackie chan has to care for his older brother sammo hung. a good film, pretty sad indeed. actions at the end is superb with top-notch camerawork and fight choreography. see yuen wah and yuen kwai help jackie chan take down criminals."
3,You'll Get Through Crash Team Racing Faster With This Guide,"This book includes the shortcuts of CTR,and tips on how to get the crystals in Skull Rock,Rampage Ruins,Rocky Road,and Nitro Court.I wouldn't want to say that the guide is bad,but it dosn't help in many levels."
5,this thing will be useful when you are looking for secrets,it'll help you with getting the crystals and coins but most of all this helps you with the shortcuts so you can beat nitros oxide
5,"Bapsi Sidhwa's ""Cracking India""","A wonderful book: an eye-opener for me. Having grown up in neighborhood teeming with Parsis, in an apartment building behind a Fire Temple, I could identify with the protagonist and her friends. The book is peopled by characters like Ayah, Ice-Candy Man and others who are so realistic. Godmother and Slavesister could have been some of my neighbors during my childhood.The cozy feeling induced by the cast and the anecdotes is a cushion for the shock that one feels as the author describes in gory detail scenes from that awful event in the history of the Indian subcontinent, the Partition. Growing up in the 60s, I heard whispers about the horrors but had never come face to face with them until I read Sidhwa's novel. The book really shook me up.Reading the book was an enriching experience; it is certainly one of the best books I have read recently."
3,Nice Book...,"I liked the presentation, organization and the the printing of the book wich I consider is of the highest quality, It also has good color ilustrations and photos, I didn't find errors of any kind. But even when I'm a beginner videographer, I consider the information contained in the book is very general and the book is oriented to explain that ""there are easy ways of making things..., that you can use several good applications available in the market for you..."" But I would have liked the book explained: ""ways of making... and the steps for finishing your projects.."" I mean the book lacks of ""How to...or the step by step for beginners"". But in general is a good book. Please be aware of that...So you won't be disapointed."
1,Very deceiving.......,I listened to the samples of most all of these songs and they sounded like they were going to be good over all but I was very disappointed when I played it out. I did not like this CD at all.
3,Mid level lighting,I was skeptical about ordering these fixtures. I was pleasantly surprised with them. They are better than anything I saw at both Home Depot and Lowes. I like the frosted globes and the design. The frosted globes work well with fluorescent bulbs.Be very careful with the light socket. It is cheaply made. Do Not over tighten the bulb. It will break very easily.
2,inexpensive for a reason,"these were cheap, and as long as you keep that in mind when you order, youll get what you expectthey are ont well designed, materials are cheap and not packed wellstill a great buy as long as you know that you may have a tougher time installing than you would if you paid for a fixture from a better manufacturer"
5,Bakes baguettes with a nice crisp crust all around,"This works very well, producing a nice round loaf with a uniform crust all around. It clean in a snap and it even looks good while it's doing it."
2,OK Chuck Berry but don't expect much Tina Turner,"I got this tape because I thought it would be great to see Tina Turner (pre comeback) on stage jammin' with the legendary Chuck Berry. I was disappointed to see that she only joins him for one song...and one she dances to more than she sings! (She does show up again with a crowd on the stage at the end to dance to a farewell number, but that's it.)If you're a Chuck Berry fan this is a good tape of his live show, but if you're looking for Tina keep looking."
5,sensual prose- compelling characters,"I LOVED this book. The language of the author is so beautiful- it feels like poetry. It is also very sensual- I could feel all of my senses participating in this book. Having never been to Hong Kong, I feel like I have experienced this city because of how beautifully this book is written. Not only was the book carefully crafted by its author in terms of its sensual descriptions, but the characters she created were compelling as well. Kate was someone I liked and Frankie was too- even with their flaws. I wanted so badly for things to be different for these girls (through the course of the story), but I was satisfied with how things ended. A beautifully crafted book with a good story and human characters- what more could a reader ask for?"
3,Thoughtful character descriptions,What I liked best about this book is the way the author could describe how someone is feeling in the most understandable terms. What I didn't like about this book is sometimes I wanted more information. The author would write about an island or a beach or some location. But I am not familiar with Hong Kong or Vietnam so I didn't know where it was or if it was 10 minutes away or 6 hours. Also sometimes she would write of items that I didn't know about -- for example lychee fruit -- what does it look like? what does it taste like? do you peel it? etc. Sometimes I couldn't visualize the details in my imagination. But I did love the variety of characters and the rich descriptions of their feelings. It was a nice short book.
2,"Interesting, but I just didn't care about the characters","This book has some beautiful passages, but it never grabs you with a good story or with characters that you want to learn more about. We read it for book club, and about 30% of the group loved it for its lyricism...but the rest of us, while respecting the skill with which it was crafted, were apathetic to the story. And it's the story that brings me to a book and keeps it on my mind. If it weren't for book club, I would not have finished it, honestly."
3,BASED ON PREVIOUS REVIEW....,I ANXIOUSLY FOUND THIS...AFRAID I ONLY GOT TO CHAPTER 3 AND GAVE UP. THE CHARACTERS WERE GREAT BUT IT GOT TIRESOME OF HER WANTING HIM AND HIM BEING WARNED OFF OF HER...ETC..NOT MUCH ELSE GOING ON....MAYBE I DIDN'T READ INTO IT FAR ENOUGH BUT IT LOST ME.........SORRY ....
4,The tilt feature is better than you think,"This is a very nice little controller. Solidly contructed and comfortable to use. Totally plug'n'play, no need for a driver disk. (assuming Windows98 or better)With tilt enabled (LED on), the directional pad behaves as a ""coolie hat"", and tilting the controller behaves as analog X and Y axes. ""Analog"" meaning it's NOT just four mercury switches that are activated when you tilt them (like some older ""tilt"" controllers I've tried).This makes it well-suited for driving games. If you use the Y axes for gas/brakes, your arms will get tired from keeping it tilted forward most of the time, BUT... if you use *buttons* for gas/brake instead, you can keep it tilted back at a comfortable angle, and rotate the controller in midair to steer with analog precision. MUCH better than ""tapping"" around those long slow corners.With the tilt feature toggled off, it behaves as a traditional 8-direction digital pad with 6 buttons."
4,Great CD,"This is a CD from a band that is from Lansing, MI its an alright CD but I reccomend getting Steal Your Soul if you can find it!"
5,A dictionary for filmmakers.,"Anyone who works in the industry knows that they and their co-workers live in their own little world. Film is filled with things specific to the industry... The average person probably thinks that N.Y.P.D. Blue is just a TV show, has no idea what a stinger is, thinks a lollipop is just a piece of candy on a stick, and ""C47"" most likely means nothing to them.I found this to be one of the most valuable books I've ever purchased. It's a handy reference manual that I keep in my tool box at all times - Proving itself to be a priceless addition.A lot of people will find it cheesy - And to a degree, some of the things covered are, but it's 10% cheese and 90% awesomeness."
2,"Does Not Deliver And Not All That Funny, Either","A well done book along these lines is sorely needed for students of film. Unfortunately ""Strike the Baby and Kill the Blonde"" does not deliver. Knox seems to think he's clever and humorous, starting with his catchy title, but his efforts to be those things get irritating quickly. If this book was at least well researched and accurate, one could overlook this shortcoming. Reads like he sat down and wrote it over a few weekends. Not recommended."
3,A Tragic Portrait of Racism,"A lot happened in the city of Chicago around the turn of the 20th century. Specifically, a black ghetto developed between the years 1890 and 1920. In this striking book, author Allan Spear takes us behind the scenes to show us what really happened during that time. There is A LOT of information present, and that is both good and bad. Readers definitely will get their fill of history, but it can become a bit dry at times. However, the vivid imagery painted in the stories interspersed among the facts provides excitement. Will it be enough to satisfy you? I can't answer that. Basically, I would recommend ""Black Chicago"" to anyone who is really interested in urban studies, the history of the ghetto and the African race, or any other relevant topic. For anyone looking for a brief, casual read about this era, this book is probably not for you. Overall, though, it is a very informative and valuable look at a time that shaped modern life as we know it."
3,A tough read,"I thought the book was very informative, unfortunately it was text book dry and boring. I really tryed to like the book, I would actually put it down a few days, weeks and finally months and eventually come back to it, however I couldnt get into it! too dry and boring...Sorry Allan Spear"
5,"the return of in your face, balls to the wall, all out rock!","THE FLAMES are the best thing to happen to rock in the last 25 years!! Anyone whose seen them play live knows what they are capable of, and this cd just hints at the talents they posses. If you consider yourself a fan of rock music at all, this cd belongs in your collection!!!"
1,DRIVEL,Overhyped machismo attempts glam rock that's been accomplished on a much higher scale a million times before...nowhere near the Ramones it wants to be. Brainless music for teenage boys.
2,Cheese,"This is not hard-drivin' rock-n-roll but a collection of predictable hooks (albeit tight) fronted by squeaky clean vocals definitely not ""rock-and-roll"" or what it's supposed to be- raw, hard, and dirty."
4,Got What I Ordered.,"This comes in new retail condition just like it looks in the picture with a hose attached. I had to use this brand a long time ago and it worked great. Have never had need for one again, and it will only work on the slow leak type flats and obviously not the tire blowouts that are actually more common on trucks over the road. but it never hurts to have it around in the tool box in the back of the truck just in case."
2,shallow and insipid,"I love horror novels but I am glad I did not have to pay for this Paperback. Someone gave it to me. The first half of the book with the problems of the main characters was pretty good but when it branched into the supernatural, it was too far out for even me. In the end, I was not sure who was the bad guy and what had even happened to the little girl or why. Maybe I am too stupid to get the gist."
2,Mission Impossible W/o the masks,"If our hero is so competent, why is he always so messed up? About three quarters in, you grow tired of the double agents, and wish for some straight ahead story line."
3,Hide It With a Smile,"Cris Cuddy's folk set has some beautiful tracks. Based in Toronto, Cuddy's idol is Mickey Newbury who appears on the back cover. (Reference Newbury's classicFrisco Mabel Joy.) Newbury also recorded Cuddy's title track on his CDA Long Road Home. The title track works well with Spanish guitar, string arrangement and Cuddy's unique lyric, ""Salvation is tearing your heart off; Take a hand & beware, There is ice in the air & your friends are all waiting to see."" There are a couple uptempo tracks like the opener ""The Checkout Girl"" & ""Just for a Thrill."" My favorite is the slow torch tearjerker ""The Beginning of the End,"" with Cuddy's wistful vocals, ""I've seen it coming for awhile, Tried to hide it with a smile, Now the plans that we made are beginning to fade from view."" Cuddy's got some good things going for him, but the set as a whole fails to ignite for me, perhaps a bit too laid back. But there's enough here to make him worth checking out. Enjoy!"
3,It was well written,"although, her reference to little girls and old men didn't appeal to me. Found one of the stories rather shocking"
3,Little Birds,"This book was different from what I usually read,but I'll have to say this much..it was interesting,but still NOT quite what I expected. The stories had no plot and they were very short stories...I expected one long story."
2,writting on a difficult subject,Anias Nin died before this material was released. She was smart in that respect.I found her writting skills to be not very pruient or exact in their emotional tone. I had the impression she was someone who did not have much of a sex life herself. The cover is excellent and again i was disapointed in her skills in this material as i have been with other writters in arousing interest.This field is very difficult to write on due to the wide range of views on the subject of erotic art. We all have our own ideas on art. The price though was good and i would suggest you try reading her for the sake of seeing what is printable right now.
3,Little Birds,Not as good as The Delta of Venus. If you are interested in classic erotica I would try Delta of Venus instead.
1,gave me nightmares,"Incest and petaphyles don't turn me on. In fact it makes me sick. Are you that twisted to think that an old man exposing himself to little girls is erotic?? Or the father 'caressing' his little girls. That's not erotic, that's a parent molesting his child. Disgusting!!!!!! Don't waste your money, or your time with this book. It's rather quite disturbing, unless you're the sicko that likes incest and petaphyles."
1,Unimaginative erotica,"Well this is a collection of erotic tales, a fare share of them circulate around lesbianism and impotence themes. In the books introduction Nin describes how she is commisioned to produce these writings with her friends and thus become a madam of a literary house of prostitution. Well the books daring words doesn't help to make it much interesting, on the contrary it reveals a stunning lack of imagination and talent. One really gets the sense of that the sole reason why Nin rose to intellectual fame, was her good looks. And thus she was able to arouse the interest and patronisation of lewd partners in intellectual Paris and New York."
2,Not Nin's best work,Little Birds is far from Nin's best. The stories stop short of true eroticism by leaving the reader abrubtly cut off at the end.
5,"Wonderful writing, fascinating scenes, truly a Nin-fan's must!","I love this book for many reasons; it's a wonderful example of Nin's amazing and artistic grasp of human sexuality, and a joy to read. In between reading The Diaries, it is nice to have something a little 'lighter' now and then!"
4,Errotic. Although,"I could not put it down, at times I wanted to throw it. The stories were intense, the imagary tangible, but 3/4 of the way through, a little repetative."
4,"Daring, especially for its time","I remember standing in a bookstore at fourteen-years-old and panting over these pages in ecstatic shock. I couldn't believe a book like this was for sale in any store, let alone a big, established venue! I was too embarrassed to actually buy it, so I came back several times until I worked up the courage to do so!Fast forward a bit, and I'm rereading this book and thinking it's much different than I remember. Still quite good, but pretty strange. The first story, the man with the birds, is kind of creepy! She delves into all sorts of strange sexual issues. Each story takes on a different kink. A lot of them deal with sexual problems of various sorts. I didn't like all of them at the time, I only had a few favorites. But those favorites did actually stick with me.Maybe not the best erotica ever written, given all the new stuff coming out, but there are some gems in here that still have the power to heat things up for me."
1,Ho-hum,I was very disappointed by this product. The only useful features were the vocabulary lists. Most of this could be replicated with a Google search. Book choices were not great. Nothing too creative. Save your money.
1,You've got to be kidding me right?,"I just recently viewed scanned pages of this book, and let me just say, what utter stupidity! granted, this book was written over 50 years ago, so i guess, according to the times, that's what the author wrote.Everything from""Masturbation is bad for you"" and ""female circumsicion is acceptable"" is in there. Granted, not in those words..It discusses irritation around the clitoris and puts forth female circumccion as a viable remedy! what was the good ""Dr."" smoking when he wrote that little gem?We've come a long way since books like this were considered valuble reading matriel. If it was even then! There's a companion book too, for boys."
3,"Beautiful maps, Great Overview!","As a sort of arm chair historian I found this book a little disapointing. It provides an overview of the Napoleonic Wars, but doesn't touch on the sociopolitical climate at all. It follows a chronological organization, but doesn't repeat dates often enough to a reliable timeline. On the other hand the maps are a treasure well worth the expenditure. I've found better timelines on websites, better overviews of the era at the library, and there are many more detailed sources available.Despite it's short comings I consider this book one of the pillars of my Napoleonic library, because of the many colour prints and pictures and the European maps showing territories controled by various players (French, English, Prussian, etc.) at different points during the war make it an excellent companion to more detailed texts such as Chandler, Osprey, and the Esposito-Elting Atlas."
4,Good Introduction to the Napoleonic Wars,"""The Napoleonic Wars"" by John Keegan is a good introduction for anyone who wants to know more about the various battles, strategies, and campaigns of Napoleon. Admittingly, I am a life-long American Civil War and American Revolutionary War student and wanted to ""branch out"" into other military history periods.The book is about 240 pages and contains 7 chapters that deal with various aspects of Napoleon's military career: Egypt, Spain, Russia, Germany, and Waterloo.The book's narrative is easy to read and there are ample colorful and detailed maps outlining the various campaigns.A highly recommended resource for the person interested in an introduction to Napoleon's campaigns."
5,The Martial Napoleon,"This author is an impeccable, authoritative scholar. His book on the Napoleonic Wars is a compact wonder of clear, well organized exposition. This is objective, factual description of the campaigns, personalities, and consequences of Bonaparte's epic career. It offers valuable perspective to the twenty-first century reader."
4,chispa,"These feel a little thin, but they are cute, my grandsons are 'fireman nuts' so I think they will love them anyway."
5,This is the best music to sleep with for my baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have bought MANY cd's for my babies nursery, this is the best cd with nice relaxing calming music. I highly recommend"
1,It's an issue with the vendor,It's been almost a month since I odered this and have yet to receive it. Very disappointed in this vendor (Webtreo) and will not deal with them again.
3,An ingenious commercial,"I got sucked into this story. As I read Alvarez's description of this coffee I kept thinking, ""This stuff sounds amazing! I wish I could have some!"" When I got to the end of the book I learned that I can purchase this coffee from the plantation (may not be the right word) Alvarez and her husband are involved in. I felt duped. This book is an ad for the coffee. I can't believe I spent my money and time on an ad. Ugh."
3,A Cafecito Story,"A Cafecito Story is a well written novel by Julia Alvarez. The main character is Joe. While on a trip in the Dominican Republic, he meets a lady who can tell the future. There she tells him that he should be in the mountains. So the mountains is where he goes. He meets Miguel there. Him and his family struggle growing coffee beans the old fashioned way. Joe learns that the family can not read or write. Joe was a teacher before, so he teaches them to read and write. He ends up buying a part of their land when he finds out how much they need the money. Joe, like his father once was, becomes a famer himself. Instead he is growing coffee beans. He learns the difficulties and struggles that come along with being a small time farmer. The book was an easy read. It was a very short book. It showed a good perspective of a farmer and the ups and downs that they face in everyday life."
2,Good Content/Poor Videography,"This DVD covered very good topics for a beginning network professional, but, unfortunately was overshadowed by the poor video editing."
4,Penny Sue Got Lucky,"I thought Penny Sue Got Lucky was a wonderful light hearted mystery. The dog is indearing and Penny Sue and Vic make a fun couple, even if they both start out disliking each other. This book is more of a light mystery than a clock and dagger. Sometimes I just want something light instead of blood and guts.I have always enjoyed Beverly Bartons books. I can truly say that I think this was one of her best in the Protectors series, but Iam a sucker for animals especially dogs. This dog's a cutie."
1,R50 fails in cool temperatures.,"I purchased three of these feeders and all three had the same defect. They all worked fine indoors but all failed when put outdoors in temperature at a little less the 40 degrees F. These are reasonably priced, nice looking feeders, easy to use with good functionality, but the analog timer fails in cool weather. It audibly ticks but the dial that activates the feeder motor does not turn. I notified American Hunter of this situation and the rep said they would investigate. Perhaps this feeder would work fine in the south but it is not made to operate in Michigan's deer season."
1,junk,"I had 3 of these type feeders and the spinner quit working on all of them within a couple months, replaced one and tired of the hassle so I have switched to another brand."
1,Not Worth It,"My husband actually ordered and attempted to use this feeder. He says(and I quote)""it is garbage"" --states: it is very un- dependable-american hunter brand never did work right in distributing corn for deer.Amazon was good--in delivery, but American Hunter leaves much to be desired"
2,Get what you pay for,I got this for my hubby b-day and the motor did not work. I had to call twice to get an rga# to return it. Have not rec'd the replacement yet but will keep my fingers crossed.
2,"A for effort, C for results","I would really have liked to be able to say that this is a good album, but sadly it isn't. It has a lot of good ingredients, but they don't mix very well. The sound is murky, and almost every song sounds like it was recorded in a rush - and that applies to the choice of tempi as well. Allison Moorer's rendering of ""Back street affair"" is simply awful. Dwight Yoakam sounds like he is doing a parody of.....Dwight Yoakam, and about half of the other singers just try to mimick Webb Pierce's (unimitable) singing style. Most have chosen songs that do not fit their voices, and even George Jones has lost his ""soul"". There are few instrumental efforts that deserve any notice - even Weldon Myrick's steel playing sounds uninspired. And so on... OK, Mandy Barnett does fine, as does Willie Nelson, and it was nice hearing Crystal Gayle again, but my overall impression is that Webb Pierce's legacy deserves better."
3,"this was written in 1961,BEFORE,we went to the moon in 1969...how little did we know...","in 1961 earth,three boys and three girls(school friends), meet a man (called ""mr man"") from another planet. mr man takes them all on a space ship to visit his six planets. the kids get to see what each planet is like(all the planets are different). life on these planets is real good-like summer camp!...lot's of fun!!!there is nothing scary in the book. the book has a,golly, gee- whiz type feel to it. it is interesting to read how what some people ""envisioned"" outer space to be like (in 1961)-fantasy versus reality."
3,The Dummies,This should be titled The Dummies. Those girls were stupid. This was an ok movie though. The main girl got it good at the end lol. Very much worth the watch
3,entertaining.....,good solid movie.....typical storyline but i still enjoyed it.....nice thrill ride at the end of the movie...who will survive...who wont & what happens to the sole survivor.......good watch..............nice ending..........and it does make you wonder what can happen when u go hiking.....not that this will really happen but u never know - makes ur mind wonder....oh my :)
3,Eh,Typical slasher movie. Not much to it. Lots of screaming and running and tortuous attacks. Wound up being rather lame.
1,"Unreadable, Obtuse","I bought this book to learn about World History, in order to comprehend todays world a bit better. Last night I gave up. I made it to page 429. I scanned ahead to WWII to see if it would improve. It did not. I am 62, and have an advanced degree. The reading is just incomprehensible. As others have stated you have to read some paragraphs several times to understand what the author is trying to say. It is obtuse to the nth degree. An example: he uses the words ""Anatolia"" and ""Levant"" without defining them anywhere in the entire book. I learned more from looking up these words online and reading about them in a miniscule fraction of the time I've spent reading the book. The maps are atrocious. All in grayscale and extremely difficult to tell one gray shade from another. The text on most of the maps is unreadable. I do not recommend this book."
3,One Major Problem...,"...with all of J. M. Roberts' books is that they focus heavily on the development of modern western societies. Just looking at the table of contents reveals this. Entire books are given to the development of European political thought, however, India, China, and Japan are relegated to individual chapters. If it is so hard to encapsulate European history in several books, what makes one think that all the richness of the eastern cultures can be summarized in one chapter? Alas, I think this is the main problem with how history is taught, its too ego-centric, always focusing on YOUR own history. Modern world affairs have shown that this leads to global misunderstandings with the most dire of consequences... Congratulations Mr. Roberts."
1,The New History of the World,The title tells it all. This is a piece of revisionist trash. It is anti-west and only worth a read if you have a strong background in western history and if you want to evidence how western culture is being defamed by our leftist intellectual elites.

2,"It's okay, but less than what I expected.","The stickers are cute, but not well made. They came folded and so it was hard to get them to stick well. One was torn due to the folding. I guess I was expecting better quality..."
5,As good as it gets,I bought this CD at a Boys of the Lough concert in 1998 and it's been in my CD player more often than any other disc ever since. Simply lovely.
3,An interesting variation of familiar tunes and some new hits,"Hinde, malaika are remade with a different style but they remain ever green. It is a must for any lover of coastal Music. Wanawake hoyeeeee!!!!!! Waume heeeeeeeee!!! Hamadi"
3,"Looks good, too large for infant","The hat looks great, but it is too large for a young infant's head. We're putting it away until our little one is a bit older."
3,One wierd virtual pet,"To start, one word.. Weird. This game is just odd. A sort of virtual pet/friend, seaman at times can be enjoyable, then can be boring, or just downright freaky. The concept is interesting and done pretty well. You raise a small group of half fish/man creatures from eggs to something.. well lets just keep it at something. The voice recognition has to be the best out there, with no need to train it to your voice, I rarely had to repeat anything. For me it got boring, after about 10 minutes of talking to my fish he wouldn't want to talk about anything else until tomorrow, so I would have to wait until the next day to have anything new happen. And it seemed like no matter how good I treated my seamen, they all talked smack to me, putting me down and never once saying they liked me. It might be a good game for some, but only the die hard virtual pet lovers, for others this game is going to be boring. Rent it before you buy.it."
1,Not a game.,"Hey guess what, this is not a game. I purchased this on the first day and it was a waste of money. This is more along the line of a digital pet, that has a bad attitude. This may sound good, but there is no entertainment value or fun in this ""game"". You will spend a lot of time watching small creatures float that have not learned to talk. Once they do grow and learn to talk, all you will hear is complaints. It is even hard to feed them and keep them happy. The microphone that is included in the game works well and is the only fun part of it."
3,ALMOST great!,"If you have the time allowable-this is an intriguing game-and Leonard Nimoy narrating adds to the bizzarre scenario.Yes,the plot is raising a very intelligent human/fish hybrid.After the first week-it goes from 'baby-talk' to asking personal and philosophical questions and stays within the personality you've described relating to you.If you purchase-DO WEB RESEARCH!!I was doing fantastic-and then he quit eating-no reason-he just stopped.I felt cheated.That's my only gripe about a truly unique item."
3,It's Great the First Few Times......... (3.5 stars),"....but after you've beat it and played it a couple times, it gets really old very quickly. But, this game is %100 original! A very unique and cool concept. I just think more could've been done to keep the replay value up a bit.The graphics: AmazingThe sound: Very goodConcept: Out of this world!Replay Value: Gets boring after you play it enoughSo the only reason why I'm giving this 3.5 stars instead of 4 is because, let's face it, it can get old very quickly. Plus, you have to have A LOT of free time to keep him alive!!! I used to have that time in high school, but now starting my second semester at college, well.....time isn't as free any more.It's a game that should be checked out, though. Just be warned, you might get bored with it real quick. I thought it was the greatest game at first, but then it seemed like nothing new happens. Once you beat it, that's it. Replay value is the only major flaw with the game."
1,It was not Freeze and Shine I received,"I have used Freeze and Shine for nearly 20 years and am very familiar with the product and have been a big fan. I just received this product and I smelled it and tried it on my hair --- this product is NOT Freeze and Shine, it is adulterated with, I think, alcohol. No shine, little freeze and a terrible smell. The various reviews I have read on Amazon mostly report the same problem I have had. Can these sellers be stopped! Amazon should not allow this to happen and should look into this problem. Luckily I had a partial bottle of the original product to compare it to."
4,Excellent Reference book,"This book is a very good reference book. It is especially good for the younger ages. It will challenge their minds, and give them the impetus to look closer into the areas of history that interest them. I am a substitute teacher for all grades and also provide tutoring. I've found that these types of books can ignite the spark in the student's mind to want to do further investigation."
4,the great pumkin ride,"great book for all who love horses and have great imaginations when halloween roles around, how our mind can play tricks on you on hollows eve. great read"
1,Something wrong here. Specified wire set does not fit,Ordered this EOM wire set. It was the correct model number after I checked several sources to make sure that I was ordering the correct set for my vehicle. The box was marked with the correct model number but it was not the correct set for my car. The spark plug boots were several inches too long. The box said made in Mexico where they must have labeled them wrong. I returned them for a refund.
4,Motorcraft wire set,"As other reviewers mentioned, wires are not numbered and some were not the same lengths as originals. However, they work fine."
1,Tennessee Rivers: A Paddler's Guidebook (Outdoor Tennessee Series),"No detailed maps. Only has descriptions of the rivers, but no details about the put-ins or take-outs or how to locate them."
4,My sentiments eggsactly !,"This great Chet Baker CD is now out of print ! What gives ? I thought Jeff Bezos was a big Chet Baker fan.... This CD is great and it makes you dream of being in Paris taking a sentimental walk with Chet and a few girls from Rue Clichy. I can still dream, can't I ?"
2,patch panel review,"I purchased the Intellinet 162470 patch panel for the remodel of my home. I have several Cat 5 runs and wanted to keep them organized. To my dismay, two of the twelve ports were bad when the panel was installed."
5,WHY NO DVD?,"For some reason, this film stayed with me to adulthood (I saw it as a child). I've seen numerous message boards where people are dying to see this film again. Why no DVD, folks?"
4,Scared for Life.....,"Okay, I feel so much better now that I have seen so many reviews of 70's kids who got the *&^%%!!! scared out of them from watching this cheesy, yet freaky movie. My mother warned me not to watch it when i was about 6 or 7, but I didn't listen, and to this day, I cannot sleep with the lights off if my husband is not at home. I have been looking for this movie for a while, just to exorcise the demons from my own fireplace....Now I see that they are remaking this movie, miromax, and it is due out in 2004....I don't think it will be as scary, even with today's technology. There was just something about hearing the name sally whispered by bald little gremlins, as they stick a hanger in the bathroom to shut off the light while you are in the shower...."
5,Sally...we're waiting for you.,"I remember being a child in the late '70's/early '80's and being afraid to watch this on TV. I'm now 33 years old and finally got the courage. The movie is a little dated but still really creepy. I went to bed shortly after watching it and was hesitant to turn the lights out! I usually laugh at horror movies but this was very effective because of what the viewer doesn't see, rather than what he sees. It's a person's wild imagination that gets him every time. This is the theme for Sally, the main character of the film, and the viewer. I wish this quality thriller would be released on DVD. I would be the first to add it to my collection. The clincher is that it was made for TV. I've never even seen a theatrical release that was this scary.Sally's husband thought it was mice...WRONG..."
1,enough with the limited shelf life DVD-Rs for the price of a real DVD,"I can not believe the industry has stooped this low with both DVDs and many CDs. No remastering, no officially manufactured product--and something that collectors hate most of all...a format that has a very limited lifespan. All at the inflated price of the real deal. Based on the titles this 'archives' series is releasing, the studio clearly knows people are searching for these titles, but they just want to take the cheapest route to make money off them--selling you something you could make yourself if you have an old copy on VHS and a recordable DVD player...Even more insulting is the fact that, now that the remake has been released, WB has re-released this as a 'special edition'. A special edition DVD-R???? Really???? Yep, that's what you get. A purple disc DVD-R. Oh, you also get a commentary by a coupla hacks who had nothing to do with the original movie..."
1,Curious horror fan? Save your money!!,"This is so regularly incuded in lists of the best/nost frightening horror movies ever made that I HAD to see it.Having watched it now, I can only assume that those people raving about it are indulging their Inner-10-Year-Old.Bad writing, bad acting, a really laughable premise, silly voices and little critters that look like wooden dildoes in bear suits might have made for chilling TV in 1973 (although I suspect the TV news at the time was way scarier) but they simply can't cut it today.Sometimes cherished childhood memories should stay that way."
1,The Re-Make is superior ... in every way.,"I was at odds after watching this film. I bought it based on how much I loved the Re-make that came out in theatres this past year. While not that well written or acted the film felt creepy and had a beauty to it that only certain films ever obtain. This original film has none of the elements that make the re-make worth watching. I was let down by all elements of it and was quite sad to see that I had believed to much about the hype of this film. ... Mind you I am a lover of Seventies horror films, so don't believe for a second that I'm just some punk kid that ""doesn't get it"". The Original Wicker Man film, The Blood on Satan's Claw, Don't Go In The House, The Devil's Blood, The Brotherhood of Satan ... these are masterworks which I cherish! ... Just letting everyone know that even if you do love seventies creepy films ... this one still might totally let you down."
3,boring!!!,"i bought this movie based on the reviews but agh....so boring little caracters,that silly little monsters...the movie its not that bad but well...ill be more carefully buying movies now, and it was not that cheap..scary????? no way........"
1,This movie sucked!,"The plot and story are horrible. The acting by all is horrible. There is absolutely nothing good about this flick, nothing! It is not interesting, scary or innovative. Ninety one 5 star reviews? What are you people smoking?"
1,Childish scary,This movie has been so overrated.It is embarrassing in it' s description of being scary.Yes if you are a young child but if you are an adult this particular version is pathetic at being scary. The little ghosts are ridiculously portrayed in their efforts to scare---- maybe the modern day version does a better job but I won't risk wasting my money.
3,"We want you, we want you, we want you...","Utterly, the most terrifying words, even now more then 30 years later.I would imagine if I saw it now, that the special effects of the men dressed up in gorilla suits with green masks would be absolutely hilarious. I didn't have much to compare it to when I was that young, so it was a real as it got. Those words creep into my dreams now and still makes me wake up panting every time."
2,Forgot how cheesy this was,I remembered watching this as a child and decided to look it up after the remake. All the reviews raved about it but it was barely watchable. More of a kids movie.
4,"It's ok... But, I respect it .","It's ok , but, Sony much better than the stupid remake . That's for sure! It's not great or scary, but it doesn't suck either!"
3,HMMM,Keep in mind that this movie was made some years ago ... needs to be remade with today's special effects and some storyline changes.
5,Scariest Movie I have ever seen!,"I saw this movie when I was 13, and like others, I had to leave the room several times. I agree with the other reviewer regarding Lovecraft influence. I have since gone to see other movies in theaters to get a good scare, and to date, at 41, this tops them all. THIS HAS TO COME OUT ON VIDEO!! The scene where Kim Darby is being drug away still haunts me. Today's directors could take a lesson from watching this one. No high tech special effects here, and none needed. The story, acting and direction speaks for itself!"
1,Borrrrrrring,"This movie pales in comparison to the new movie out there on the screen now. Dull, dull, dull. Not worth the purchase price, rent it if you are really curious and save the money."
1,This movie has very little to offer.,"I purchased this video quite cheaply (ex-rental), thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, if you can't see very well, but the movie is trash. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'The Driller Killer' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just bland bland bland. Incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by wholesome cheap scares and not very entertaining dream horror sequences. This movie has very little to offer. So, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark."
1,"Good movie, Poor quality recording","This is the old movie my friends and I had watched as kids. While it was fun to laugh at the old clothes and hairstyles, I was terribly disappointed with the quality of the recording. The picture quality is quite grainy and the recording is so dark that occasionally all you see is the grainy face of an actor or actress on an almost black background.Perhaps a better version of this old movie will be released someday; but stay away from this one."
1,Very poor DVD quality,"I was very disappointed when I watched this DVD. I loved the movie when I first saw it and looked forward to seeing it again, but the quality of the recording makes it almost impossible. Very grainy and hard to see. I wouldn't reccommend buying this item."
5,Creepy is an understatement,"""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" is the one movie I have yet been able to complete. By this I mean, when I saw it at seven, I changed the channel as Sally was being dragged into the fireplace. Singularly the most haunting film of my life. If you want creepy, you've got it here. Psychologically disturbing, this ""made for tv"" movie is one of those that has the ability to stay in your mind for twenty years. I can only pray that I will find it online somewhere and that this time, I can make it through to the end."
2,**1/2 stars for this '70s Guilty Pleasure,"This had some creepy moments when new, but even then I found it hard to ignore that '70s made for TV ""cheese factor""; lousy sound, poor plot & dialogue, hideous wardrobe...stop me at any time! I have to agree with the reviewer who said most of the reviews here are based on nostalgia rather than content. This one did look a lot better back in the day. Still, I would recommend DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK to those who yearn for 60s and 70s Horror. You could do a lot worse. Note: This is an on demand product. The picture quality looks like someone burned it from a grainy old VHS copy. A remastered version may elevate the rating to perhaps a shaky *** stars."
1,Poor Quality - DO Be Afraid to Purchase.,"We were so excited to get this movie in the mail. With great anticipation we popped it into the VCR to show our children 12 and 15 an important piece of our childhood. The quality was so horrible that you could barely see the image. It was dark and washed out. Any scenes that were in low light (most of the movie) were not visible. I understand that this is not going to be high quality tape and certainly not hd!! This was just not watchable. It almost seems like it was a tape...of a tape....of a tape. There was no label on it and the case was just a blank black one. Almost seems a little shady. There is no way this was a video made by any studio. It said that it was in ""great condition"". Hardly. Buyer Beware!"
2,Don't worry. I'm not afraid...,"I heard such good things about how scary this one is. I actually bought the DVD as Netflix doesn't even have it listed.Having watched it, I'm pretty sure all the reviewers are writing off of their nostalgia, having watched it as children. The movie was not suspenseful or scary in any way. I think the biggest mistake was that the monsters were revealed too early and then were shown repeatedly, removing any suspense. And the monsters looked like guys in bear costumes with onions for heads.Not a movie I would recommend. I do want to see the remake though. Because the story idea was a good one.On the upside, the remastering was excellent. The picture looked great."
1,AWFUL,"I was very excited to watch this movie, but the quality and sound is awful.Seeing as how this was a made for tv movie, I was not expecting the picture quality to be great but the sound was awful.I had to keep turning it up to almost 100 then back down to 55. The sound kept getting high and low.Very annoying.As I read further reviews, I did notice that these dvd's are copies and they pay little or no attention to quality and detail. Save yourself the time, money and aggravation.The movie is 5 Stars. It scared me to death as a little kid and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves pirating and distributing cheap mercahndise!"
1,"Poorly Acted, Poorly directed","This 1973 telemovie is so incredibly bad, I have no idea why Warners would want to unearth it at all.Director John Newland lets the cast stumble around like rag dolls in a southerly.The low budget could only supply three goblins (three, count 'em, just three!) each with a rubber mask with no slot for a mouth.Flood 'em with red light when they're still, then show a green light to show 'em moving!Total bunk - wish I'd realised what a disappointment this flick was before I shelled out the cash - the 2011 remake (filmed in Melbourne, Australia) is 100 times better than this trash."
5,Still scary without being gross!,"When I moved into this 200 year old farm house in Vermont and started restoring, a flood of memories came back to me. I was 12 years old again, loosing sleep because of this flick. Those creepy little thigs lurking in the corners, chanting ""Sally, Sally, We want you, we want you"". There are still rooms here that I don't like to enter after dark, and a couple I keep locked. Don't be afraid of the dark is still one of the scariest films of all time. Even without all the blood, gore & special effects of today's lame horror movies."
5,SCARY,"Just as scary as I remember from when I was a kid. No super special effects like today's movies,but scary just the same."
5,A Classic Horror,"This kind of movie is what ""classic"" truly means. One of my favorites! I have not seen the remake yet, but I doubt it could be better than the original!"
3,FROM HELL IT CAME!,BEWARE OF A DVD-R WITH A COVER ON THE DISC. THE DVD WILL FREEZE UP EVENTUALLY MAKING THE MOVIE UNPLAYABLE..From Hell it Came
1,Don't be Afraid of the Dark,I loved this movie as a kid but ordered it from Amazon and received one that wouldn't play. Sent the DVD back and had a a replacement sent. Anxious to see the movie but was disappointed when the second one wouldn't play either. I have a fairly new DVD player and have had zero problems with all other DVDs so I know the problem isn't due to the player. Have decided to ask for refund this time around. I know you will love this film if you are able to get one that will play.
5,Great B-Movie,"I bought this for my aunt, because it scared her silly as a kid.It's an awful movie, but a great laugh."
4,Great for a 5 year old,Please ignore the previous review from the woman who has an 18-month old. This book is for 4-8 year olds. My 5 year old enjoys learning his classifaction of animals etc with this book but you may have to pick up lost pieces.
2,Don't bother....,"This book is a good idea in theory but there are some major flaws. First the cards are easily lost and get stuck in the book. Also, the cards are two sided - one animal on each side so there are fewer options for a child to place animals in their ""homes"". My 2 year old mangaged to lose most of the cards. I emailed Baby Einsteins customer service and I never heard back from them until I emailed again 3 months later.... Overall, this product has been a waste of time."
4,High Cost Shipping and Handling,"Product's fine, but $17 shipping and handling on an $11 box of flashcards is ridiculous."
1,Do NOT buy this book,Amazon.com sells only volume 3 of this 5 volume novel: useless unless you already have volumes 1 and 2 and 4 and 5.
1,Junk,"I purchased 3 of these scanners because it received such a great review. I can only describe the product as junk. To attempt to use it I had to ""rig"" the scanner by disconnecting and connecting it before using it and sometimes during use because it would freeze. Also the sound card had to be removed from the computer.Assistance from Microtek was of no use and they themselves did not know how to deal with the problems.If the scanner could actually work without all the hitches then the quality of scanning and the various programs that it came with would be of great use. I only know this as a result of using another scanner with the software that the Microtek came with.The 3 Microtek scanners are now serving as very expensive paperweights after 3 months of trying everything short of magic to get them to work on various computers in the office."
1,poor support for Windows XP Professional,"Microtek's web site claims that this will work with Windows XP. I had to e-mail their sales staff to ask a technical support question (""how do you get this to work?"") and they just said ""it will work with USB"". Wrong. I've removed and reinstalled the driver that ""works with Windows XP"" many times. They need to update their drivers for Windows XP. If you install the drivers as administrator, only administrators (not regular users) can scan images. If more than one user is logged in, the scanner programs will hang. A lot of trial and error and unplugging/plugging USB cables to get this to work. The only positive thing I can say is that on occasions in the past when I have been able to configure it successfully, the scan quality was good."
3,"For just $130.00, I think it&#65533;s a good deal.","This is my 2nd Microtek Scanner and I am relatively pleased with it this far. After I downloaded the updated driver supporting Windows ME, I could quickly install the scanner, although the ""Scan Detector"" does not always recognize the scanner. Since this model has no OFF/ON switch you could be wasting energy. Reflective art and negative 35mm filmstrips scan well (especially the ""Descreen"" and ""Pre-Scan"" functions sold me). The included LiquidLight 35 functions as a transparency adaptor, but it only works well with 35mm filmstrips, slides are difficult to scan due to a missing mechanism that hold them into place (Microtek suggests the use of clear tape!!!). Using the USB port, I find the scanner to be reasonably fast but noisy. For just $130.00, I think it's a good deal."
2,NO SUPPORT FOR WIN XP PRO,"I've recently upgrated from ME to XP Prp and found that this scanner is not working (not recognized) under Windows XP. Microtek doesn't seem to have specific drivers fron WIN XP, only for WIN 2000, 98, and 95. Although I did purchase this scanner about 2 years ago, I never had problems with it under Win ME."
2,"Price is wonderful, but nothing else is","This was my first Butterfly, bought in the Sixties, and so Leontyne Price is imprinted in my min for this role, one she neer sang on stage. Her voice is really too big and lush for Cio-cio San, but that hardly matters given her ravishing singing. What does matter, unfortunately, is the stiff, unyielding conducting of Leinsdorf and the trumpet-like bawling of Tucker. both are so bad that it is hard to listen to this set anymore, especially with so many fine alternatives around."
5,A Thinker,This book will make you think. It is well written. I loved the main character. I felt like she was someone that I could relate to. The plot was thick with excitement. I did not quite expect it to unfold as it did. I love a book that can surprise me. The pets are an interesting part of this tale. I think it was great how Lackey worked them into the story. This is so like and unlike Snow White all at the same time. It is one of the better Snow White rewrites out there.
3,"Not bad, but...","This is just, well, lacking something. I like Mercedes Lackey'swriting in general, particularly her older work, and she has chosen quite an interesting world/mythology to write in here, one she hasn't worked in before, to my knowledge. But something is missing. It might be that things unfold too neatly and easily for the good guys. It might be that the characters aren't fleshed out very well. It feels like the book should be longer and considering the setting (London early 1900s) and type of adversaries, it should be grittier. Won't she please, pleasewrite in the style of her first few books again??"
4,"Good, Engrossing Read","I was actually surprised when I found out this was a Snow White and the Seven Dwarves retelling. Besides that, I found this to be a very good book. I had absolutely no difficulty getting through it and well, if it wasn't the most historically accurate book I've ever read, it was a sight better written than some books that could claim more accuracy and not as good writing. Maya was a very interesting character and I enjoyed all of her animal companions. The only flaw I found with this book was that Maya and Peter's relationship felt slightly rushed and a little to sudden. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed a good fantasy, or just a good story for that matter."
4,Medicine and Magic - A suffragist's cup of tea,"I was a bit surprised by the negitive comments on Lackey's latest. Maya's character - a female physician treating London's ""ladies of the evening"" to make ends meet and still minister to the poor - is quite new. I thought the crew of animals was a bit overboard but I enjoyed all the other characters. I felt the bias and conflict within both the London magical and medical establishments was well portrayed and accurate - for a fantasy. The Sayers reference and the incidents of the deaths of suffragists due to forcefeeding strengthened the book. Development of the romance was a bit weak but otherwise a good effort. I would be interested in a sequel."
5,A Lovely Read,"This book is pleasantly creepy. The spookiness of gaslit London and the romance of mystic India combine to make an atmospheric adventure. Nice details create a sense of being there. How I'd love a place like Maya's conservatory, complete with tropical plants and magical animals! The story isn't too fairy-taleish until the apple seller appears near the end. All in all the story is a fun read."
3,"ok, but too dark & gory",This book was ok because I liked the history and the character Maya and the majic but the love story lacked something and the violence was too much for me. I hate that kind of human sacrifice stuff.
5,Snow White with a twist,"You would think that taking an old fairy tale and switching it up would be old news....this books takes the idea to a new level. If you didn't know before hand, you don't realize that this is a twisted fairy tale until about halfway through the book, where you can start to make parallels. Very well written, very entertaining, and one of those books you hate to put down until its done."
3,Lots of guess work when it comes to glass!,"As a collector of cut crystal, I have learned over the years that not all experts are experts. This book is a good reference book, but as you know, most pieces are not marked by maker and there is a lot of conjecture as to who made what. This book appears to be fairly accurate."
5,A MUST,"A GREAT COMPILATION W/ GREAT XICANO & MEXICAN ARTISTS PERFORMING ORIGINAL MUSIC TOGETHER. NOT TO MENTION I'M PLAYING DRUMS ON THE AZTLAN UNDERGROUND/ROCO(MALDITA) & LUIS(TIJUANA NO) TRACK ""BREAKING DOWN THE BORDERS"""
4,Now *this* is psychological horror,"It all starts out innocently enough... Jennifer and Peter decide to elope, so off they go.... but little do they know that when they stop at Blossom House to find a minister, their world will change forever. Lippincott is very talented with sick, twisted horror. But one has to ask these idiotic victims... did no one ever think of ganging up on Henry and Harriet??? These two freaks are truly creations of a bizarre mind. The entire premise of this novel is sick (fantastically so, I loved it!). Expect to be shocked and appalled by Lippincott in this book. I have to wonder, if the man's married, what does his wife think of all this? Read it!"
3,This cd brings back a lot of happy memories,"This cd has sure brought a lot of smiles to me. It reminds me of happy times when life was a lot slower and the times were a lot more enjoyable. It makes me want to go back to the past.I had heard of Page C. over the years, but had never had the opportunity to hear him play. Well what a pleasent surprise he has been. He and his trio play in a very exciting and entertaining manner. They are very laid back with their approch to music. Their repertoire is a good one that most people will know and enjoy.Before this cd I had never hear of vocalist Mike McCaffrey, but since hearing him on this cd, I have become a fan of his. I do wish he and Page would do a sequel to this cd. I think they are perfect fit together.If you would like to dream a little, this cd will help you do just that very thing. If you like being happy this cd will help along these lines too.Recommendation: I would like to strongly recommend this cd."
1,unusable,i bought this scaner and when i scan a picture it comes out ok but i cant do nothing with it the screen frezes on me so its worthless to have it
2,Bulb Burnout!,"I didn't use this scanner much, but after out of warranty, bulb burned out, can't be replaced by the customer. Replacement costs twice the cost of scanner itself. Given so many other people have had this problem, wouldn't buy it again.The ScanWizard software is very good, and keeps this from getting a one star rating."
2,"Guess what problem I had........Yep, Bulb burnout!!!","I basically bought the Microtek scanmaker 3600 b/c it was slim, looked good and was fairly inexpensive campared to others. I enjoyed it while it was scanning (of course I don't know a lot about computers,etc.) However, It only worked for just a few months before the bulb burnt out. Imagine that! I also got the red low glow (???). Like others, I found it hard to get to the on/off switch. And of course as said before, the only way to get it fixed was to mail the scanner back to them at my cost. Well forget that. I bought a new scanner and it definitely was not a Microtek. Microtek is not worth the time, trouble and added stress. Thanks for reading. ironjaw"
2,short bulb life,"The scanner worked fine for the first month. Then I accidentally left the power on for a week, and the bulb burned out. Not completely, but the light is no longer bright white, but rather a dim neon red and all scans are so dim and noisy as to be unusable. I guess the bulb can't be replaced. What do you expect for [the price], I guess."
3,A great scanner for the money!,"I'm on my second 3600. The first one scanned perfectly and then one day the bulb dimmed. I took the scanner apart only to discover the bulb was not replacable. This is a disposable scanner but for the money it provided amazingly terrific scans. I returned the scanner and got a new one that has been working ok since but the color balance is not the same. Scans tend to be a little on the yellow side but fixable in PhotoShop or PhotoPaint. My suggestion is to turn it off when not in use. Like some scanners, this one does not turn off automatically like my older piece of junk Mustek scanner."
3,"Nice, but not great.","The scanner works, it was a snap to install. Quality of the scans were not that great but they were liveable. I especially like the USB interface. I wish there was some port replicator or something so my USB port would still accept another device."
3,no support from company,"This scanner and the software were easy to set up and mostly worked fine. Unfortunately on the relatively little bug in the software I can get NO REPLY from the company to my questions. Amazon has been great, but after spending over ten hours trying to get help from Microtek, reading everything pertinent (and a lot that's not) on their website, sending three emails to the place they tell me to send them and waiting over two weeks for any reply at all, I'm not very happy. I will not buy anything from this company again because I'm afraid if it DOESN'T work I won't get any help."
1,Problems Since We First Got the Scanner,"We have had many problems with this scanner. Please be aware that they do NOT have a toll-free phone number, and when we called their ""technicians"", we had to pay the long distance phone bill. Not to mention that the ""technicians"" told us that they didn't know what was wrong, but we still have to pay a 30 min. phone bill. Plus, if we want to get it repaired, the product must be shipped to California and THEY WILL NOT PAY SHIPPING. Also, in order to get the light bulb replaced, you have to send the scanner to California. The product does not allow you to replace the light bulb yourself. We will never own another Microtek scanner."
1,"repaired once, and now broken again","I bought this scanner about 15 months ago. The bulb broke after 8 months of light use, and was replaced under warranty. (I paid shipping.) Now, the bulb has gone out again, and the product is no longer under warranty. Microtek says it will be $80 - $100 (plus shipping) to fix. Might as well buy a new scanner. I don't recommend buying this scanner.I do like the software. All settings are customizable. The software has many more features than HP scanners I have used in the past. Plus, it is switchable between basic and advanced user interfaces.Bottom line, don't buy this scanner."
1,Bulb burns out,"Like many other uses, I have had nothing but problems with this scanner. The first one I had the bulb burned out after just 2 months. Although under warantee instead of just shipping me a new bulb (they are easy to access for replacement) Microtek insisted I ship the entire scanner to them for fixing at my cost. On my second bulb now, it only lasted about 6 months, this time with me always turning the scanner off when not in use. Replacement is more expensive than the scanner itself when out of warantee, and customer service leaves a LOT to be desired. If there was a source to purchase replacement bulbs I would recommend this scanner, when working it's a nice product. Since I can't locate replacement bulbs I would never purchase this scanner again, or any other product from Microtek, due to their horrible customer service."
2,Bulb Blows,"I received this scanner with a new computer purchase bundle. Thought I got a good deal but the bulb burned out less than 30 days after I got it and I had only used it twice. Called Microtek and they replaced it for free. Haven't had a problem with the replacement yet. Also, I have had to uninstall and re-install it several times. The program consistently locks up and fails to function. Decent scanned images and fairly easy to use for the newcomer. Slow speed and not a lot of reliability."
2,Poor quality -- nice images,"I'm torn on this product.It has very nice software bundled in. It does scan nice images.However, the lamp burned out less than 90 days after purchase. I sent it back to Microtek at my cost, they replaced lamp and it burned out again...just outside the one year mark.Not worth the headache. and Microtek's RMA ... for this product. I had a cheaper scanner that lasted much longer.This product should have last at least two years before the lamp went out...if not longer.Don't waste your money on this company, if this represents their quality control."
1,Disposable,"I too purchased a 3600. It was inexpensive when I bought it so I should have known better... The inside of the lid is black. That translates into photo copies using a LOT of laser toner. Also, the power switch is a small toggle on the back. Turning it on and off is a hassle. Leaving it on will burn out the bulb in short order. (Which is exactley what happened with mine.)Turns out the bulb is some sort of special Microtek only bulb. Even if you are a technician, you can't get the bulb. If the printer is out of warranty, getting the thing repaired will cost more than the original price. My suggestion?Spend a little more on a different brand with a common bulb and buy the extended warranty."
2,Caravan crazy,"In my experience in using this book, I have never been unhappy with anything that I have quilted. But the this book takes the cake in being disgraceful. I'm talking about the big bang quilt on page 49. None of the directions are checked. The list of what you have to buy to make one of these is wrong and the author has you cutting pieces that you don't need or use in the quilt. I have never been so involved in a quilt before but now that I know that one set of direction is faulty. I should have known. Buyer beware. Quilter beware. I'm usually a great fan of Fasserr's fabric and patterns but this time I'm very disappointed in him."
4,nice,"I will say in english that it is a good book, not the best bye Kaffe Fasset but ok.More in swedish...Bra bok, bra mönster, det är dock lite trist att han avvänder bara sina egna tyger tycker boken Läckra lapptäcken är bättre, använder d tyger frn överallt (lite second hand ocks vad jag förstr) Mönstren däri tilltalar mig mera ocks"
5,Suppie,It is great to watch these classics again. Keep in mind these are fantasy and made in the 1950's. Some of the episodes make me laugh.
5,Superman Series,This product was like I remembered the show and great pleasure was brought back as I watched each show with no commericals.
3,seasons 1-4 are better,"Very fun but dumbed down, even my grandsons ages 5 and 9 like the first 4 seasons better. Okay for diehard fans but it can be obnoxious. Wish it were black and white."
4,5th &6th Last but not Least,"The 5th and 6th seasons completes the total package of the George Reeves saga. I wish there were more maybe ""lost episodes."" The story lines were funnier but to see them in order of there orginal broadcast was fantastic. I was hoping for them to include the I Love Love Lucy episode!!! But I can't ask for everything! At times the print quality was washed out but it is still better than when I first viewed them on a B&W TV in the early 1960's . I highly recommend the entire 6 seasons."
5,super just super,I was happy to recieve The Adventures of Superman-5th and 6th seasons. Everything came on time and it works well on my dvd. I will be happy to purchase again from this seller. Angela Miller
5,"George Reeves, the original and best Superman","Having been born in 1954, I vividly remember coming home from school and watching ""The Adventures of Superman"" every day. Naturally in the 1960's it was in black and white, but the stories with all their simplicity stuck in your mind and captured you imagination. With Seasons 5 & 6, I now have all 104 episodes of this great TV classic, and I still enjoy them all immensely.Each episode is a minautue movie with great baddies, and of course Jimmy, Lois, the Cheif and Clark Kent/Superman.A favourite is ""The Mysterious Cube"" and I think the menu is quite clever. Thats my opinion."
5,The Real Superman Lives On!,"This dvd AND all of the others in this George Reeves collection are a must for anyone who wants the original and ONLY true adventures of Superman! Its that simple and anything else is second class,nothing else needs to be said."
4,A Classic!,"Well there's very few to say, this is a great peace of TV history, a great peace of Superman history, you'll love every single chapter, every actor, George Reeves leave this world not loving Superman, but 50+ years you can say that his work as Clark Kent/Superman has break the time barrier. Phillys Coates was a excellent Lois Lane not to say a really gorgeus one. The rest of the cast is fantastic, i just complain about that i will love some more extra material, more documentary stuff, but i know at that time not much archives will survive."
3,"a little too much, don't you think?",It's just disappointing to see that it costs that much for ONE card. I should've known that before I bought my Compaq Audio Player. I guess I'll just have to store my songs in WMA or AAC formats. So... is the price going down anytime soon? ;)
2,Why so much?,This is not a bad card-it's vey useful. It cost so much money! I have an Audiovox mp3 player and to get a extra 32meg card for it costs 50$ Here a SanDisk SDMB-16-470 32MB MultiMedia Card costs 100! I understand that this is not just for a certain mp3 player but u should lower the price!
1,NOT COMPATIBLE w/ Audiovox MPDJ MP-1000,"Beware!: Although guaranteed to work with all audio devices, this SanDisk MMC is NOT compatible with the Audiovox MPDJ MP-1000. Audiovox promises a compatible version under their own product name by May, 2001. See their web site www.audiovox.com or call their Customer Service @ 1-800-290-6650 for more information."
5,GOOD BUY,GET IT IT WORKS WITH EVERYTHING EVEN AUDIOVOX!!! IF IT DOESNT WORK WITH AUDIOVOX FOR YOU GO TO AUDIOVOX.COM ON MAY 1 AND GET MEMORY JUST FOR THE MPDJ MP3 PLAYER!
4,HELP for all SanDISKMemory users,"Many users of the sandisk memory are having problems because they are not formating the memory after it is installed. For example if you are using the MP3 Audiovox player MP1000 you should install the downloader software that came with the player, then install the memory card and right click on the memory card space to format the memory. Then it will work!"
5,Decent Card,"This is a decent card. It does what it is supposed to for me which is store pictures. Excellent size media, about 1/5 the size of compact flash media. 5 stars with no disappointments."

Received for review from the publisher.Details can be found at Sourcebooks Casablanca,an imprint of Sourcebooks,Inc. and My Book Addiction Reviews.It was originally published by Jove Books in 2002."
3,Not one of her best,"I was enjoying this story up until about 3/4 of the way and it was downhill after that. It is meant to be a light and amusing tale but after the h did everything to stay pure the whole way through and right up until 5 mins before, she suddenly throws herself at the H and demands he make love to her. It was so ridiculous I went back a page or 2 just to check that I hadn't misunderstood her saying ""No"" she didn't want to sleep with him. Whatever! Then she runs off without any logic or explanation when he offers to marry her.I finished the book simply because I only had a chapter or two left but the book was spoilt for me after that."
3,Not Quite Up to Snuff,"This item looks great, set-up is simple, and has everything needed to operate right out of the box. The picture produced is terrific.However, the DVD being watched had better be pristine, because if it has the slightest flaw, this player will lock up and will not get past the flaw (dust spot, small scratch, ding, etc.). It seems to have limited oversampling to manage defects in the DVD surface/data.I bought two of these players and both hung up on the same DVDs at the exact same place, but the cheap player that I had been using, and which was being replaced with one of the Yamahas, played right over the defect without a glitch. So, I was disappointed right off the bat. But, with a new, unblimished, DVD, it plays great and gives a fantastic picture. Just hope I don't have too many flawed DVDs."
4,Kuh Ledesma's voice explores a new sound,"A name synonymous with great singing of love songs and ballads whose voice sounds luscious in her albums and more in live concerts, Kuh Ledesma delivers an innovative sound and style with Precious. Unlike her former CD's (she has around ten or more for the past twelve years) which explore Kuh's magic and artistry in standards, pop and love ballads, Kuh's desire to try a new direction in her ability to create music led to this body of work. The CD enables the listener to imagine a beautiful island of paradise with the repertoire she presents. The songs are great and different (by the second time I listen to it, Kuh has made me want the songs more than ever) from the usual winning formula of her mimicking/singing like Streisand. But like anyone who knows she does not want to disappoint fans like me, Kuh delivers a great ballad, Love Begins With You. Here is a great Filipina who has come out with an innovative sound. Get it for your own pleasure."
3,great warm up from this exciting filipina singer,"she is cool when she sings. hers is the voice that makes you dream about anything under the sun. great singing, polish recording and exciting arrangements. more albums please from this beautiful diva from the philippines."
1,Confused identity!,Kuh Ledesma has been billed as the Philippines' top diva but the sobriquet is undeserved based on this mishmash of an album. What kind of music is she really purveying? Kuh has no signature style of her own. She apes Streisand one moment and dips into Madonna. Her vocal range has become even more limited and her renditions are perfect for a karaoke bar in Pasay City.
3,Kuh has the Barbra Streisand voice but the songs don't showcase it.,"I'm sorry to say but I'm glad I didn't pay too much for this CD 'cause the songs suck. I mean, this huge Streisand-like voice wasted here on these boring songs 'C'mon people. Too bad 'cause I was really looking forward to this CD when it came in the mail. But, like Sarah Geronimo, another great young voice....the songs selected make these want-to-crossover singers remain Un-Noticed!"
2,Retirement recommended,"Kuh's salad days are over. Sure, she was one of the Philippines' foremost singers in the late 70s and 80s, but this past decade has chronicled her decline. Her material is second-rate; I don't recall any one piece that stands out. And her singing has not matured at all."
1,Kuh-lang!,"The Philippines' self-styled diva has tried so many times to pattern herself after Streisand and Madonna, never finding her own voice, so to speak. This attempt at pop jazz is dismal. Kuh Ledesma lacks passion and fire. A fiasco!"
4,Nike Sports Watch,"I love it. My only complaint is at night it is not the clearest to read, but in the day light it is very easy to read with the big numbers and letters.It is one of the sportiest watches I have seen.I realy love the count down alarms."
1,Bad Fit,"The TB end on the one I received was moulded way way oversize, The hole for vent pipe from the valve cover was about 1/4 inch too large. The MAF fit a little loose, and the filter box end was the right size, but it was too much trouble to make this mess work. I sent it back and got one from CHEVY."
5,Gorgeous!,"Garfein's gorgeous voice interprets a largely unknown repertoire of first-rate reform Jewish liturgical music, with a few old favorites tossed in as a bonus. There are moments so sublime here that I shiver each time I hear them. Not to be missed!"
1,Dissappointed,"I bought this CD for Kiddush, a song I recently heard for the first time. I was even excited to learn that the Cantor was female. However, being a music major, my ears must be tuned differently than those who've made comments before me, because I cannot endorse this CD by ANY means.The Cantor sings with an uncontrolled vibrato (think Stevie Nicks), no dynamic range, no connection to the meaning of the words, and no interplay with the choir she's singing with.The choir itself sings off pitch and, rather than singing like an ensemble, is a pin cushion of individual voices piercing through the soloist's part and ruining any sense of cohesion.I sadly report that when I offered to donate this CD to our Music Resource Center, the music librarian played it then laughed hysterically.I am not writing this to be mean, and I apologize if I've insulted anyone, but this CD was a huge waste of my money."
1,"Nice Selections, LOUSY voice","I am sitting here trying to think of something nice to say about this singer's voice; I'm sorry, but I just can't find anything. Despite the training (Bachelor of Music from Rice University) that the album insert says that she has had, she can't hold a pitch, has a wild vibrato, and goes flat so many times I was gritting my teeth by the end of the first track. She's what many of my choir directors would have called a ""Screamin' soprano"" who can (most of the time... ok... SOMETIMES) hit notes, but lacks anything approaching vocal control. Certainly she doesn't sound as though she's had a voice coach in the last 15 years or so; I hope she gets one.Meanwhile, I'll be putting the album up for sale, as I can't even stand to listen to it.Spend your money someplace else."
3,Good but is this Jewish?,"I have to admit, it am in the process of converting and wanted a contemporary collection of Jewish music in the house. I was especially excited because it featured a female cantor. Unfortunately, I played this CD and it...reminded me of church not synagogue! Lovely for what it is though, with the opera voice, choir and organ music. Not quite what I expected."
2,duck butthead cover,I think the butthead covers are adorable but I have had 3 of the duck cover and have lost all three of them because theydo not stay on my club no matter what the size. The parrot however does.
3,BabyPrincess Ariel Doll,I bought this doll for my 2 year old granddaughter. It is verycute and she has enjoyed it.
5,novel,This book arrived within a week or so of ordering it. It is a used copy but in very good condition. As a piece of literature I would recommend this book to anyone studying Palestinian or World Literature - the author of the book is a highly respected writer. I was not disappointed that's for sure!
5,Book discribing reality,"This book gives you an idea of the suffering and neglection of a nation, on the watch of the whole civilized world."
1,The title is inaccurate,"Paths to Glory doesn't fulfill the promise delivered by the book's title. Instead it diverges into statistical minutiae, and spends minimal verbiage on ""HOW"" or ""Great Teams"". Baseball dynasties such as the 1890's Boston clubs are pathetically ignored."
1,Poor Results,"Not only did this product not work, it caused burning pain in my stomach. I stopped it, and the burning stopped. Just to be sure, I re-started it, and the burning came back. It was advertised as having no side effects, but I disagree."
3,Presentation needed refinement,"Neal Ford is certainly the best of DVPress (Now Defunct) speakers and he understands the subject well. As with his other DVDs however, I was often distracted by mistakes and the later discovery of them being left in the presentation. He also needs to move the mouse a little slower. There were times when his movement though a problem was so fast it was like a blur, with too much jumping around. If he ever decides to do this type of thing again, he needs to edit the film a bit better so that the viewer doesn't have to replay certain scenes. Neal does know his material though."
5,JSP review,"Neal Ford is an excellent speaker and presenter. His presentation is concise. This is a great course for beginners trying to learn Java applications for the web. Neal Ford and DV Press, keep up the good work."
1,Garbage on DVD,"DVD Press is the most horrible video presenter and just like all their videos this one is bad too. A company that could teach software programs and stink at just making a program that doesn't have horrible video and sound should be illegal. How could you learn to make an editor when these people cannot script, edit, debug there own program. If this DVD was captured from a java page then the author must not know how to really build a java page well. The only thing good about this video is the name JSP2. Other than that this is just Neal Ford on a video talking about JSP2. There is no proof that he can write, script anything anybody could understand and it would crash as in made with errors. Neal Ford is about as pointless as a piece of hard copy paper with his name on it. Of course, it would probable have typos on it too."
2,Dated story and unrealistic dialogue,This book was originally published as a Loveswept Romance in 1989 then re-released as an e-book in 2012. The story is okay but the dialogue between the characters is ridiculous. People don't talk like that and it's very distracting. I've read 2 books by this author and they both had the same theme of difficult women and dedicated men. I won't be reading anymore by Judy Griffith Gill.Disclaimer: I received the Kindle book in exchange for my honest review.
5,Excellent Condition,This book is in better condition than I expected. I love using this book for my Shamanic Journey translations. Thanks so much for a well-kept book!
5,Animal Wise: Spirit Language & Signs of Nature,"LOVE THIS BOOK! Basic, easy to understand. I have a small side business making power animal/spirit guide jewelry & this book is the BEST reference I have ever found. Clear & concise. The author contributes some of his own experiences, but it doesnt run on & on into chapters of me-me-me & this-is-true-because-I-said-so. You make your own conclusions using the lessons he has learned. He lays the stones for you to walk your own path."
2,More of the same from Ted,"Another cover that suggests things Native American, another round of clip-art-type illos, another dose of the ""New Age"" (see my review for Animal-Speak).This book is interesting in that it lists scores of less-popular, less-cuddly critters: insects, arachnids, arthropods, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. (Where else ya' gonna go if you think you have a Crayfish totem?)"
3,Paradise PC Game,The game is not like Syberia I and II. Many of the clues are not connecting so you can get to the next level of the game. I do not enjoy this game.
2,not self-contained,I don't think I could have gotten through this game without a walk-through. I didn't think that the next step was a natural progression and there were not clear clues within the game to help through the progression. The ending was anti-clamax. The leopard was not enough of the story. Being the leopard should have been part of the story not an extra.
3,Not as good as Syberia,"I bought it because it was made by Syberia team, and its preview seemed promising. Unfortunately, it isn't as good as Syberia. Paradise has terrific graphic though, but its story is not attractive. You don't know what happens in the first place, and then you know it's about a person's past. Not a delight past, nor is it absorbing. To my surprise, the ending is convincible.Creatures in Paradised are been designed great; it's a pity that they just being used as ""items"" in the game. The leopard part is a good idea, but this part doesn't affect story proceeding, nor is a branch story line, just for fun. You can decide play or ignore leopard part.If you're a fan of Benoit Sokal, you might want buy this piece; if you just an adventure gamer and want to play good adventure game, you can consider others."
4,A useful and readable insight into U.S.-Mexican relations,"This useful book offers more than its title implies. Instead of being a dry legal analysis of a treaty, it offers a different way of looking at the history of Mexican-American relations. The author provides a compact review of events before, during, and after the Mexican-American war. In addition, the book provides a capsule review of attempts by Chicanos to seek the reversal of past injustices through the courts and by means of political action. The clearly written text is supplemented with five maps and four figures. Michael Michaud, Vienna, Austria"
1,GBA Travel Case,"People don't buy this travel case it is absolutely garbage see I have a lot of games and a lot of accessories for my GBC, GBA, GBA SP, and Nintendo Ds Lite and this does me absolutely no good it can hold maybe two accessories tops and yeah it will hold your GBA SP alright that's if you don't mind your GBA SP sliding around inside this piece of junk I wouldn't buy this if I were you unless you don't mind letting your GBA SP get damaged it's your choice."
2,spiderman toy,I ordered this for my 4 yr. old grandson. He played with it for a little while and than went on to other things that kept his attention better. It did arrive quickly and in excellent condition and was reasonably priced.
2,Fun for about 10 minutes,"This is fun for about the first 10 minutes. Then pieces get lost and the wonder is gone. I only paid $[...] for it and it was a stocking stuffer, so I guess it served its purpose. If I had paid regular price for it, I would have been mad.Save your $[...] and take your kid for ice cream at the park instead. Go down the slide with him and push him on the swings. You'll get more out of your money that way."
1,Horrible toy,"I bought this for my 4 year old son who isn't into Spider-Man but is very active. I thought he would have fun shooting the webs. He took it out of the box and played with it for maybe 2 minutes. It didn't work very well. The ""webs"" just seemed to fall off the end of the toy. A friend of his (a 5 year old boy) came over for a playdate and got really excited when he saw the toy (this kid LOVES Spider-Man and anything that has to do with Spider-Man). He too only played with it for a matter of minutes before becoming bored. Boring toy - don't waste your money."
4,Perfect for Halloween!,Goes great with Spiderman Halloween Costume....if a younger kid is trying to get a little of the 'web action'...:o)
5,Old school Pop meets the new Country,"My Morning Jacket brings the best of the old Pop sounds (sometime reminiscent of the Beach Boys for me) and the best of what's new in alternative country such as Ryan Adams/Whiskeytown and Wilco. If you like alt. pop or country, you will probably enjoy this album, and it's a great album to make the transition from one genre to the other also. The lyrics often speak of more depressing or melancholy scenes, but the music always keeps you just happy enough and interested enough to want to hear his story out. Almost like your a caring friend who's listening. Highly recommend this album, check out this little known band soon."
1,Awful - a review from outside Kentucky,"I listened to ""At Dawn"" after having listened to ""Z,"" which is their latest release. Like ""Z,"" their songs ramble a bit and they go into long, drawn-out solos - a ""jam band"" if you will. However this album is much more crude and there is way too much reverb. Call me ""urbanized,"" but the production values are poor and there is a lack of hooks throughout the entire length of album. The album is so long that the CD stops playing near the end on my computer's CD player - ""Strangulation!"" gets strangulated, and I don't even hear the bonus track. ""Honest Man"" is the only standout on the album, a blues-driven rocker that is unlike any other song MMJ has done. The rest, well - I'm glad it's in the past."
2,What are you guy's smoking in Kentucky?,"I'm not from Kentucky and I have never seen this band live. I had heard ""The Way That He Sings"" on the net and I did like that song, so I bought the disc.The rest of the disc is terrible. Now I know why the lead singer uses so much reverb and echo. His voice [stinks]. He needs to, to cover up how weak his voice is. I'm usually not this harsh, but after reading the positive reviews from the customers from the bands home state, I felt obligated to write an honest non biased review. This disc was [spendy] too."
4,lonesome and lovely,"Beautiful, haunting music that makes you feel like should see them live in some sort of scenic outdoor mountain setting. It makes me think of the Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon with more of a country vibe."
5,How it's supposed to be...,"Excellent lyrics, great melodies, and a live show that will leave you... I've seen these guys twice now and it just keeps getting better. I'll skip the ""alt-country"" comparisons because these guys do what they do, and that is to kick out twangy rock pop jams... Not to mention the reverb, Jim uses reverb on his voice like Neil Young uses it on his guitar- a lot- it's very unique. I've never heard a band like these guys, this album sits right next to my Exile on Main St.lp because it's that good."
4,"Helpful, Compact, and Lamenated","Easy to carry around and sturdy for it's lamenated. For it's size it can fit in one's small bag. The index of places of interest such as palaces, parks, Wats, bus stations, and other venues are listed. Necessity places such as embassies are very useful as well, especially as one is doing visa work to travel to neighboring countries. If you're a tourist and your survival Thai isn't very developed, this map will help you when taking taxis. Choa Praya River express stops are also included"
1,Useless,"If you are hoping to get a superficial look at the layout of Bangkok--this map is for you. If you hope to navigate by it--don't bother. Only the major streets are labeled, it doesn't extend beyond the center of the city, and because of the lamination (which I thought would be a plus) it doesn't fold well. I read another review which complained about the lack of detail but I went ahead and bought this thinking they couldn't possibly print a map without including adequate detail--I was very wrong. Buy a different map!"
5,Fantastic!!,"I don't want to overstate this music...but WOW!We sure you stand to hear a lot more from this artist!In our house we cook, clean, dance,wiggle and work to this beat!"
1,Doesn't work,"I have used WINDVD Creator for about a year and decided to upgrade to WINDVD Creator 2 Platinum. I purchased from Amazon because of my experience purchasing many items and the excellent price. I received the product and installed it and it doesn't work. The program ""crashes"" when making a DVD. I have tried repeatedly to contact InterVideo and have not received a response. I now have a piece of software that doesn't work and can find no technical assistance."
1,Bad,"This program came bundled with my computer. It is pretty bad. It has limited features and I can't play DVD's on my JVC DVD Player recorded with this software. I tried DVD's and VCD's with programs like Showbiz 2 which is very good and with Movie Factory 3 and I can even play those in the play station 2. Also the video and sound skip a lot and it has pretty low quality. It was a major disappointment so I had to buy extra software. I Chose Movie Factory because it was cheaper, and of the same quality as showbiz,and also included burn now for recording data or music to disc. I even recorded some slide shows of my parent's recent trip to England on Movie Factory and they were very impressed. The program might work for you, but I wouldn't recomend it to any one, try the demos of other software you can download directly from the internet and then choose the one that works the best for you. Most video editing software offer free trials for up to a month."
5,Important music from the heart so thoughtful and clever!,"... This album (his last) is so profound and deep I have listened to my copy at least two dozen times and still find new meanings to what Mark was saying. Each song speaks to me on some level. His tears and questions are similar to my own and he relates them using unusually clever imagery, both musically and lyrically. His poetry is deep in meaning and his cries and frustrations are so vulnerably shared that they are felt like a nerve ending.Most artists don't stick their neck out artistically/or personally, thus we often can't relate with them. Mark was different. We feel like we are being invited into his deepest thoughts. This is rare in art. ""Satellite Sky"" works on all levels-It's cutting edge music and profound poetry!!"
3,"given the choice, I usually go for Monaco Grand Prix","But not always. F1 wins over Monaco GP in some areas. Mainly in presentation. As other reviewers mentioned, in F1, there is a little more dynamic atmosphere - crowds roaring, camera flashes from the grandstands, etc.Monaco GP, however, has a much better driving simulator. It wins hands-down for simulating spins and texture changes. F1 allows you to drive at nearly full speed doing hard turns (even on grass) and come out unharmed, but in Monaco GP you have a pretty good chance of slamming into a wall if you try that (even with ABS and traction control on). The one thing that F1 seems to simulate reasonable well is understear. If you try breaking too hard coming into a turn, your front tires lock up and you just plow straight forward...When I want to play a couple rounds of something flashy, I'll start up F1 WGP, but then I'll switch to Monaco for more realistic racing.."
1,f1 world grand prix,"please, please, please do not buy this game as it is a total waste of money! the graphics are ok but the game is slow, the cars' controls are really bad and the other cars cheat! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,"This game is slow, boring and the graphics just STINK!","Do not buy this game ,take my word for it this game is trash please don't hurt your system it does not deserve this awful game"
1,"Content fine but,","I will not buy any more of these, I Love Lucy as much as the next guy -- even more -- but I won't be nickled and dimed at a four episode a disc rate. Everyone else can release season by season. This is just stupid. Even a ""club"" will send you the next one when it comes in. To much $$ and effort here. Do us a favor and follow the standards other TV sets have started. Go season by season. You'll probably sell a lot more!"
1,Worst Photoshop Book I have read so far,"I have read several Photoshop Elements books and have been working with Elements for over a year now. I consider myself a competent user of Elements.If you are a beginner I would not recommend this book at all. The examples are very hard to follow. It does not come with the images on a CD so you can follow along (you have to go to a site and download them one at a time, if you can find the site). Even then the instructions do not explain well why you do something. For a beginner I would highly recommend a book like ""Photoshop Elements 5: the missing manual"" or ""The Photoshop Elements 5: Restoring & Retouching Book"".If you are a more advanced user I would also suggest to stay away from this book unless you want some ideas for projects or images to use. Otherwise it's useless."
1,"Dangerious,. not what it claims to be.","This switch is not what it claims to be. The heat range is wrong. Beck Arnley confirmed this. BA consolidated production and is using a different heat range switch and stamping this part number on it.I don't buy Beck Arney or Napa because this ""consolidation part numbers"" for parts with diferent perfoemance causes problems. In this case cooling fanns come on late shut off early and engine overheats. This is a constant with Napa, very serious on brake shoes."
3,All the right moves - but doesn't age so well,"I don't think this excellently shot film stands the test of time too well, which is such a pity because the Cold War issues it explores are powerful and impactful, and one can only imagine how relevant the fears of protagonists Captain Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) and Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) are in the Kennedy era (the film turned controversial after the Kennedy assassination, not long after its release).I especially love the scene where Senator Iselin accuses the Department of Defense of Communist infiltrators at a press conference -- the virtual split screen action between real life shots of the Secretary and the Senator excanging barbs and a TV display was jarring and innovative, a snide remark on advent of television's burgeoning influence on politics.The film moves at a sluggish pace at times, crippled by some useless screen time from Janet Leigh -- I'm not sure what her purpose as Marco's love interest really serves."
1,Oh My God....,"What a tedious piece of work. Vapid dialogue, underdeveloped characters, and abysmal acting make this one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even Angela Lansbury couldn't save this one. How is this movie a ""classic?""Hope the remake is better..."
3,Two sided DVD version,"This is the first DVD release of this fabulous 5 star film, but the disc has major flaws. One side of the disc has the 1.78 widescreen full version of the film, but it does not upconvert on 16x9 TVs, leaving you with a small picture surrounded by black on all four sides. Side 2 of the disc has the pan and scan version (4x3) of the film and it does upconvert! Crazy. Get the Blu Ray instead."
4,SPECIAL EDITION OF THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE PRODUCT,"THIS ITEM WAS PURCHASED FOR A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY. I CAN ONLY ASSUME IT WAS AS EXPECTED BECAUSE I HAVE NOT HAD ANY NEGATIVE RESPONSE. THE SHIPPING, COST AND CONDITION OF THE PRODUCT MET AS ADVERTISED."
5,Heinz Ketchup,This is one of those movies I want to see again and again.This story must be understood in historical context. During the Korean War the American public was shocked by our POW's confessing to war crimes as a result of brainwashing by the N Koreans. It was a simple step for Condon to exaggerate and produce a somewhat believable story for that era. Condon was so skilled with this technique that some conspiracy theorists actually believed the plot line of Winter Kills.The Heinz Ketchup bottle scene is one to watch for.
5,A Classic...,"A classic about the ""Cold War"" era with some truely villinous characters...The incest angle could not be fully explored, but that was the tone of the country at that time...Otherwise, it's one of the most perfect movies ever made..."
4,"Good film, but hardly a 5-star.","A good film, with fine acting. But not a great (5-star) film because: a) Janet Leigh character's fall for Marco not credible or convincing; b) The film is too pertinent to the times to resonate as strongly beyond that era. This makes it less a universal theme than, say, Citizen Kane."
2,a screwball drama,"I appreciate that this was more or less withdrawn discreetly from public view following the JFK assassination, which it eerily preceded by about a year: the movie's conclusion shares some elements with that tragic event.But that doesn't necessarily mean it's any good. The plot is so corny and far-fetched that you will have believability problems throughout.Weeks later, you'll think back on this and won't be able to get the word ""corny"" out of your head."
4,A hint of nightmares...,"Nightmares bother a group of soldiers who have arrived home after the Korean War. Major Marco (Frank Sinatra), who is one of the men suffering from the nightmares begins to investigate their reoccurrence. A frightening detail appears, which indicates that their nightmares are almost the identical. As the clues accumulate the plot thickens and the clues point toward their squad leader in Korea, Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey). Nevertheless, the mystery remains why and how Raymond is involved in their frequent nightmares. Manchurian Candidate keeps the audience in guessing in suspense throughout the film and it does not let go of the audience until the final scene."
2,CNN 2000 - A Disappointment,"First of all, the program was only 1 hr. 14 min. long. Secondly, instead of fully showing most of the cities, they kept the ""live"" format, jumping from place to place. Naturally, except for the occasional split screen, only ONE place can be shown live at midnight. The others show ongoing, post-midnight celebrations. I'll wait for someones presentations of each city in it's fullest, thank you."
1,How Depressing!,"This disc should have been a wonderful record of the world's celebrations as I remembered watching on TV. Instead I have a God-awful piece of trash that looks like it was edited on New Year's Day by someone still hungover. Never has so much wonderful source material been mangled, butchered, and just plain disrespected! This disc should have been done with at least some eye to future generations. A real downer. Avoid at all costs!"
1,This is a two hour commercial for CNN,"Don't waste your time with this one, the CNN millenium logo is on so many views, it even blocks much of the fireworks at the bottom of the screen. I would have paid twice as much if they put in the effort to make it worthwhile."
1,Awful waste of money!,"Actually, I wanted to give this 0 stars!I expected more from CNN - but as I listened to Larry King read off a bunch of credits for the first five minutes I knew that this video was going to be just a rehash of the original broadcast. I was expecting pictures without the CNN ""bug"" in the corner and dull commentary. We got poorly edited segments of festivities that should have been shown in full and long drawn out segments of stuff that should have been edited down. For example: With all the pyro that was going off around the globe, why did we have to suffer 3 whole minutes of various shots of the Hollywood sign all lit up with blue flashing lights? Overall, this DVD sucks. Let's hope that ABC has done a better job with their video."
2,Is it what it is...,"This is basically a timezone-by-timezone view of the Millenium celebrations at major cities around the world, as shown on CNN that day. At each countdown the major cities are shown together so you can see how each one celebrated at the same time. Video quality about the same as broadcast TV. Audio quality not great. No extra stuff. But you knew it would be this way. Consider it a souvenier and move on."
3,Quality does not match Content,"This is not as good as I expected! A lot of celebration has been cut off. And there are a lot of degradation in screen quality! I remember when I watch the celebration live on CNN thru my cable, the live cast is sharper than what is shown on the DVD! (I thought DVD is better quality!)It is a good DVD to keep and has a good content, but the quality is a bit low."
3,Not Good Huh?,"I thought this DVD was good. I enjoyed watching the huge fireworks displays on this video. It does cover every time zone here on Earth. Although this video is short. But, I bought this video so I can show my kids & grandkids in the future that I got to witness the Millennium. I think you people should do the same. Because this will be the last time you'll get to see a Millennium. Remember that!"
1,Horrendous picture quality,"This could have been good, if attention had been paid to the transfer to DVD format. The fireworks look more like indistinguishable blobs of light even on a TV... on a progressive scan computer monitor or hi-res TV, forget it. Don't waste your money if you want to see sharp, clear fireworks & images... clearly this presentation was thrown together with no thought at all. Maybe you taped something off cable on new years eve, 2000... if so, what you have almost certainly looks better than this, so see if you can get it digitized."
3,Just as good as the millennium celebrations,"It is a DVD to own, maybe see again in a few years, and relive these moments all over again. As other viewers mentioned though, the quality is not top, many interesting towns are missing (like Saigon, where I was), and in some instances four cities were on the split screens: HELLO, we are not live anymore! I won't mind seeing Washington in full size after seeing NY. No need to put them together at the same time and have to squint. Plus, I thought President Clinton's speech was really good and would have liked to see it on the DVD...It could have been much much better, but it is the only one available: it is the monopoly law."
4,Great Rememberance of the Millennium!,Some great highlights of the entrance of 2000 from around the world. A perfect keepsake for an event that each of us will only see once in a lifetime!
1,I feel ripped off.,"I was soooo looking forward to seeing the ""best of"" year 2000's fireworks celebrations on video. I am so deeply disappointed I can't believe it. I feel that CNN has ripped us off with a video that is a waste of my time and money. Except for Sydney, WHERE THE ( )ARE THE FIREWORKS? Mostly I get to listen to their stupid reporters TALKING about them. CNN, I did NOT want to see your talking heads! I didn't nearly get enough of the Eiffel Tower on new year's eve, and for my fifteen bucks I now get even LESS! And I remember London having a big display, didn't they? Split screens were almost as bad as no screens at all. Time was wasted on local rituals on pacific islands. How many times will most people want to relive the Pope doing his thing? And trying to capture the celebrations ""in time"" is a ridiculous idea for such a video. What a sorry piece of work. I could do so much better, it is pathetic. Please, CNN, call me and I will do the work for FREE..."
1,Didn't work as expected,"I purchased this item to power a passive sub-woofer I own. Prior to buying it, I described what I was hoping to accomplish to the manufacturer and was told this was the perfect match. It wasn't.I'm guessing that this amp is really good for something, but for me it has proven to be a paperweight."
1,Horrible waste of money,"I thought after reading other reviews that this would be an amazing time saver. I am not sure if the manufacturer cheapened the materials, but this knife is not sharp at all. If you try to cut carrots they fly all over the play because the knife is too dull. I tried to cup an apple and it couldn't even slice all the way through the skin. I tried to cut up my daughters waffle and it wouldn't even slice all the way through that! What a waste of money."
1,Got2b original KINKY Mouse is WAY better!!!,"I have been a user of the got2b mousse for many years now and am VERY upset with this new product. When you pump it out of the container, it disintegrates into a very thin drippy substance!!! I called the company and reported my complaint. If you are looking for a GREAT product, look for their original KINKY mousse. You will its results!!"
3,Kid loves it - but three star because...,The puzzle is definitly very good. The kid to whom we presetned it is glued to it according to the parents. But the three star rating because puzzle makes the noises (vehicle sounds) on its own and it is very annoying especially at night time. We changed and put in new batteries too.. but that did not help.
2,Disappointing character development,"I was surprised by the number of readers who rated this book 4 and 5 stars. While the premise of the novel was interesting, I thought that the characters of the book were poorly developed. It felt like the book was too short and didn't give the author sufficient opportunity to convince the reader of Livvy's emotions. I could see the story leading up to Livvy's growing feelings for Ray but when she finally realized that she loved him, I was not at all persuaded. Similarly, I couldn't really understand her unquestionnable trust in the two Japanese sisters. I could see the friendship developing but not enough to turn a blind eye to everything -- particularly when she herself understood the perils of precipitous love. The writing was fine but the book came across as a good start -- not a good finished product."
5,Great book at a great price!!,"I bought this book for my friend for Christmas. She had seen the movie but had not read the book. She loved it. I have not read it yet, but I'm going to!"
4,Enjoyable,This book was a great read. As a native of Colorado I enjoyed all the references to places I am well aware of. I also like this era of history. Very well done.
5,Thoroughly enjoyed this book!,"After seeing the Hallmark presentation of this story, I was interested in reading the original version. It was a wonderful read - loved the characters, loved the writing style, and was glad to read about our involvement in WWII from a totally different prospective - that of the farmers in the midwest who fed our country and who were close in proximity to some Japanese interment camps, using them as laborers. The author presents both factions of our population with heart, and I learned some new twists on our history while thoroughly enjoying the book."
1,bad copy. Dirty and marked. Looks like read even though bought as new!!!,Would give it a negative star if I could! Book looks used and dirty with a large black mark on the bottom!!
3,How to put this....,"I too found this book by way of the movie. I enjoyed the movie very much. While it does change from the book a bit, I feel the director of the movie put more into character development than the book did. I am puzzled how this became a movie to be honest!It is a good story. I wanted to finish it. But I found myself always looking for something on the next page and not finding it. There was not enough depth of character with Livvy and Ray both. The whole situation with the Japanese girls just went a bit far for me.So after reading the book and wanting more ""meat"" page after page, more ""umph"" it suddenly ends. She suddenly gets it, has a change of heart and all is well. I suppose the title is expressing there is magic in ordinary days, yet she was very firm in what she wanted to do. To turn so simplistic in a matter of pages left me scratching my head wondering......"
4,Very romantic but only 3.5 stars because of bland secondary story,I thought that the secondary plot in this book was a little too much. It seemed to take up about half of the novel. A little more time could have been spent on the relationship between Livvy and Ray. I found Livvy a little to cold towards Ray at times which made me feel as though she didn't deserve him. Not a nice way to feel while reading a romance. This is also on DVD and it is excellent!
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I thought I would love this book based on the reviews. It was a good story, but I was disappointed overall. The dialogue was not believable, and the story development seemed rushed. The side story about the Japanese girls seemed like it didn't even belong here. It added nothing. The biggest disappointment is that the reader was not given the time to watch the characters develop feelings, the author simply tells us all of a sudden that there are feelings."
2,save your time and money if you are over 13,"It was a sweet idea, and the research was probably okay. But this is not a good book. The relationship between the main characters unfolds in a herky-jerky, nonsensical manner. The heroine makes emotional leaps and intellectual connections that are simplistic, contrived, and unconvincing. The dialog is completely stilted and painful to read. Maybe this would appeal to a young adolescent who has watched so much television she is unable to recognize bad writing. I ordered the book because my library system doesn't carry it. That should have been a clue. I would love to have my time and my money back."
2,"Disappointing, I liked the movie better.","I had seen the movie and really enjoyed it, so I decided to buy the book to read to see if it had any more details since I loved the story so much. The book was boring, and I didn't enjoy the writers style of writing. I liked the movie better. Save yourself some money, and see the movie instead."
3,a disappointment,"I saw the Hallmark movie first and loved it so I went and bought the book. I was expecting a clean wholesome story like the movie, but it was not like that. In the movie the man who she had the extra-marital relationship with is only briefly mentioned, but in the book she repeatedly spends a lot of pages talking about their past relationship and even the scene of her being promiscuous. I was greatly disappointed and I threw away the book. I do not recommend this book and due to the promiscuous scene it is not even worth the rating of 3 stars. The Hallmark version, though, is a wonderful, clean, wholesome movie.The Magic of Ordinary Days - Hallmark"
3,not a great transaction,The book was supposed to be in new like-new condtion it smelled like smoke and the cover was bent. I was not happy.
4,Not So Ordinary,"Our book club discussion was wide-ranging and enthusiastic because so many of us came from small towns in the west or midwest. The common theme of displacement between the heroine and her war camp friends engaged us all. If you ever have felt being ""a stranger in a strange land"", you will relate fully to this story. Happily, also a tale of women's ability to adapt and grow."
4,A sweet romance,"I bought this book after seeing the Hallmark special on TV. I read it in one evening and really enjoyed it. I don't think the author is immature. I certainly wouldn't fault the author for not being Tom Wolfe! If I want that sort of challenge, I read Tom Wolfe, not a slim paperback that's been made into a Hallmark movie. This is the kind of book to read on the beach or sitting on your porch when you want a nice escape into another time.That being said, I thought the book did a great job of showing how Livvy grew to care about Ray. It was better then the movie in that sense. The reader also gets a better sense of the fun they have together and how they grow to enjoy each other's company and trust each another. It has all the sweetness the movie portrayed and there were several touching scenes between the two of them. All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the movie."
4,The Magic of Ordinary Days cast a spell on me...,"Unable to sleep, I grabbed this little book and curled up on the couch. A couple of hours later, I was still up, and finishing a really fine novel. Quiet, thoughtful characters and a lonely setting, against the backdrop of war and prejudice, set the stage for this sweet, but in no way saccharine, novel. Other reviews have called this a romance, but it is not. It is a book about growth; about coming to grips with one's choices and finding happiness in life."
3,"A few good scenes, but ...","This DVD wasn't good enough to buy. I rented it, and it had a few good scenes. As the previous reviewer mentioned, there is a nice Jacqueline Lovell bathtub segment with another girl here, probably the best segment of the whole DVD.There were quite a few attractive girls here, but many were small-chested. If you have a preference for smaller women, you might enjoy this one. I don't remember seeing any Playmates or any other Playboy models. Most of the girls here were unknowns.There were several scenes here, maybe 12 or 13, and some were cut together really short. One really cute Asian girl had a 1 minute segment only.Another Playboy DVD that is worth a rental, but not worthy of buying and keeping in my collection."
4,Solid album with some standout tracks,"A cd that you can listen to all the way through, but ""Hard to Love"" and ""Goodnight/Goodbye"" are really great songs. Also check out his brother, Josh Hoge."
5,"New Day, Kieran Goss","My wife purchased this album (New Day) for me, when she was on business in Ireland, some years ago.She went to a music shop and ask for something by a local artist, that has acoustic guitar.This was the recommended work and I am happy that it was.I like this album because it sounds like a mix between Donovan (lyrics and guitar), Dylan (lyrics) and Willie Nelson (guitar).Just good music."
5,abu record reel,"I have used many baitcast reel and this is by far the best i have ever used.You know when you cast a baitcaster reel and some times you think ""oh i can feel a birdnest coming on"" with this reel it is virtually non existant,you also find yourself casting further and further . To me this reel has no peer,i can't rate it any higher than that ."
4,Not a bad addition to your Hollywood library,"As some reviewers here have pointed out, this book is long on anecdotes but I'm giving it a 4 star rating because not everybody has heard every anecdote--there were a number I hadn't heard--and they're interesting and worthwhile recording while those people were/are still around. Perhaps some deeper historical context would have been useful here, but over all I enjoyed reading it and got out of it what I was hoping to get: a feel for the contradictions and idiosyncrasies of a fading studio system against the onslaught of new technology (ie television) and changing social mores. Recommended."
3,Barbara Payton Omission Reflects Rather Superficial 50s Coverage,The authors state they did not intend this book to be a comprehensive review of 1950s Hollywood. Yet they seem to have missed some notable figures such as the almost unbelievable fate of early 50s actress Barbara Payton who in less than five years went from starring in major films to being an alcoholic prostitute.Good coverage of Confidential magazine and also the three gossip queens. Should have been better.
3,"high on anecdote, low on context","What did the lives of the Hollywood glitterati mean to American culture during the 1950's? We don't find out. Lots of anecdotes, most quite familiar, but little sense of historical context. The text is well written and goes down well, but when the book is over we are left with no greater understanding of the 1950's or the movie industry, wondering, what was the point."
3,Patchy but with some interest for movie lovers,"If you read this book from cover to cover then you may be disappointed as not of all it new and interesting. Nevertheless, there are some chapters which deserve the attention of movie lovers including the genesis and production of SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, the dalliances of SAMMY DAVIS JUNIOR as well as the struggles he endured despite being an entertainer of genius. A book to be cherry picked and read at the airport."
3,"Fascinating, Too Splintered to Be Great","The comparisons to the perfect book City of Nets by Otto Friedrich can only hurt The Bad and the Beautiful by Sam Kashner and Jennifer MacNair but it is hard not to see this volume as a follow-up of sorts to that classic look at Hollywood's underbelly in the 1940s. This book begins quite weakly with early chapters on such topics as an assorted group of children of stars who fared poorly in Hollywood but the book does eventually take off nicely with later chapters on Lana Turner and Kim Novok and movies such as Sweet Smell of Success and Peyton Place. The choppy nature of the book makes it feel sometimes like a serious of magazine pieces cobbled together. Still, overall it will reward the reader who plows through with many interesting anecdotes and thumbnail sketches of Hollywood life in the 1950s."
3,Perfect if you like Vanity Fair,"Great book, full of salacious and well-written anecdotes about Hollywood in the 50's."
1,It is bad not beautiful,"Probably the worst book i have ever read on the subject, it is a very poor rehash of very old tittle tattle, save your money."
1,The likes of Tony Curtis?,"When the likes of old queens like Tony Curtis are interviewed for their alleged ""recollections"" you know the book is B.S. He, who lied about an affair with Marilyn Monroe, talks about Mae West in this book. And what he says is total fabrication. I know MANY of Mae West's close friends from the time period in which he speaks, and she had none of the characteristics he speaks of. It is hearsay that we have all heard before, indicating he knew very, very little about her personally. And the ""writers"" assesments are absolutely appalling.Having said that...what can you believe in this book? What good is a book where you have to weigh what is fact from fiction? The bigger question is, what do you WANT to believe? The truth, or what may be titillating?There are hundreds of cheap Hollywood gossip books. This is just another one.A NOTE: I love salacious stuff! I'm no prude! However...it must be accurate or I am not interested."
5,Good for the mind,"Very relaxing, and gentle on the ears! I would recommend this to all who would like to fly with angels..."
4,Inexpensive Therapy!,This CD relaxes me when I'm feeling tense. Well worth the cost! I recommend it.
3,Not my thing,"Alright, it seems to me that Pachelbel was definitely a talented lad. But I'd rather hear his stuff with the origional instruments used- or at least in classical format. This CD sounds too much like elevator music to me. I guess if you like that sort of thing this CD would be for you. Me I'm sticking with classical. Just as relaxing but ten times as inspirational- and it won't put you to sleep."
1,Havent received ITEM,I have yet to receive this Item. Making me ponder if I will ever purchase from AMAZON and its vendors again.
1,Oh why did I believe the review?,"I bought this CD after reading the reviewshere and am now resolute that I will never againblindly trust such anonymous reviewing. I wantedPachelbel's Canon and I got the worst kindof new-agey dribble imaginable. The Canon itselfis played once and the rest of the CD is filledwith syruppy variations that fall flat as theyleave the speakers. Hey, can one return aonce-played CD to Amazon? I rate thisCD triple ugh!"
1,"Very dissapointed, Canon Molested Beyond Recognition","I love Pachelbel and who doesn't? I was looking for a CD, much like you are, with it done in various ways- piano, violin, vocal, etc. Different tempos, chords, instruments, etc. I thought this was it. No. This is like PacHELLbel. I can kind of make out a Canon tune in the staggered tempos, extrapolations, and outright molestations of the original tune but it's just too far from the mark. Maybe I am not sophisticated enough. Great for elevators in medical buildings. One track though is the original essentially and it is very well done but the rest... I want my money back!"
5,Great Product,Takes 2 minutes to affix to a wall or cabinet with the enclosed screws. Takes 2 seconds to then open a bottle.No more rooting about in a drawer for an opener.
5,The Best Bottle Opener On The Market,Starr X has continuously been the industry standard in bottle openers. I expect this bottle opener to last longer than I do. I have given these as housewarming gifts with the cap catcher bundled in and they are great - no longer do you need to look around for a bottle opener when its right there in the kitchen. I bought my own to mount on my crutches when I broke my leg (see attached picture) and it was very useful! The product ALWAYS removed the cap in 1 shot. I would recommend the cap catcher to go along with this product.
4,A Heartfelt Perspective,"As the months pass and take us further from September 11, this book offers an important, inspiring reminder of the acts of heroism, small acts of kindness, and just plain blind faith in humanity that animated so many people that day.""A Mother's Essays"" was a pleasure to read: inspiring, sometimes heart-wrenching, but always engaged and engaging."
1,"If you like controversy, this DVD is for you, if not","skip this video and just donate $20 to the Corolla Wild Horse Fund.We spent a week in Corolla, North Carolina this summer and toured the wild horse sanctuary. If you want to learn about the Spanish Mustangs that live there, I'd recommend you take one of the tours that are offered, where you will get to see the horses and learn about them from one of the informative and friendly tour guides.I found the video, in contrast, to be mostly political and slightly depressing; showing the back and forth between those that wanted a protected area set aside for the horses and those residents that opposed it. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing, even with the narration of Charles Kuralt's familiar voice. I'm glad the horses got their sanctuary, however, I didn't want to learn about the politics involved, I wanted to learn more about these beautiful creatures. I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for that information."
3,Flutie Comes of Age,"The way Flutie copes with the poverty & turmoil of herfamily is in ever-increasing silence. She is not only afraid to speak,she is afraid of being. As I read I wondered if I was supposed to like this book, this heroine, this mute misery. I often had to re-read sections to make sense of it & sometimes that sense was horrible. Partly because of Flutie's inarticulateness, partly because of her raw-boned neediness, partly because of her hidden voice. This is a devastating coming-of-age of one very lost girl stumbling toward womanhood. Worth the effort!..."
5,A must for music appreciation,"This 4 CD set not only contains some of the best performances of the last century, but also works as a comprehensive review of some of the finest musical literature spanning from the Baroque period to Modern Avant-Garde. Some of the earlier recordings are better for nostalgia purposes due to the poor mediums of the times, but the performances for the most part are professional. Only complaint: Some of the best works (Wagner's ""Die Walküre"", for example) are only provided in excerpt form to showcase a certain performer or section of the piece. Otherwise a worthy investment for the price and amount of quality music that is presented."
4,Clever approach! Useful tool!,"Popular topic, clever approach!This book kept disappearing off my desk as one person after another - from twentysomethings to midlifers - kept asking to borrow it! Everyone wants to know if they need to make changes to the way they handle money as well as other assets.This book, with its strong Biblical underpinnings (should I use the word 'footings'?) makes a useful tool and excellent resource. The practical assessments and end-of-chapter reflection questions sparked many enlightening conversations here. The end-of-book opportunities for commitment move people past the ""ah-hah!"" moment and into real application.There are plenty of books out there for the person who just wants to gain knowledge, but this one is about making changes. If you need to confront the truth about your money-handling habits and you desire real change, this is the book for you!"
3,Old perfume,"I ordered this perfume & I can tell it's old. The packaging is from at least 5-6 years ago, the color of the perfume is yellow & it should be clear. Also the price on the box is $35.00. I always purchase this perfume at Victorias Secret on line or in their store & the perfume is clear not yellow and the price hasn't been $35.00 a bottle in years. I was expecting a new fresh bottle. Perfume does go bad after a while so I am not sure if this is any good."
5,"FIRST BIKE!!! Great bike for a five year old,","The girls wanted bikes from Grandpa for Christmas. Took an hour to put together. The fork was too skinny, took a few minutes of prying to separate it. Easy set up. Grandpa brought his own tool kit (which is NOT very specialized), and managed just fine to put the bike together easily. Amazing shipping using Amazon.coms 'Free shipping for a year package' of ? $80?) Ordered it the Sunday night before Christmas, arrived Tuesday, intact.Very pleased!! Training wheels were a bonus for the first time bike rider. The girl was thrilled!Huffy Girls So Sweet 16 - Inch Bike"
1,Such a disappointment,I read the first two books in this series which were fantastic and then I got to this one. It is terrible and a real disapointment.
4,The exotic outpourings of his mind rarely disappoint.,"The exotic outpourings of Mr de Bermieres' mind rarely disappoint. If you want to discover the magic of Latin America, save yourself the airfare and buy this book instead. Travel to a land of magical realism, where jaguars are domestic pets, men transform themselves into eagles, and dead children are reincarnated as hummingbirds. Mr de Bernieres travels in the footsteps of a modern-day inquisition in which doctrinal certitude is accompanied by unswerving brutality. Both are described in language which ranges from the poetic to the scientific. The juxtaposition of passages of lyrcial emotion with clinical descriptions of extreme violence often shock, but never fail to move. If Mr de Bernieres has a fault, it is in his disappointing denouements. His stories flash brilliantly, but fade away improbably. The pleasure is in the journey rather than the arrival"
5,A Must Read!!,"Thomas Clement uses this book to tell his story of being one of the first Korean Adoptees. He tells of his struggle to ""fit in"", in a culture that is different from the one he knew. He also tells what it has been like for him to ""grow up Asian in a Caucasian"" family. Mr.Clement uses humor like no other. There are some parts that will have you laughing, but others that will bring you to tears.Being an adoptive parent of a child from Korea, I found The Unforgotten War to be a book that has helped me have an understanding of what it it can be like to be adopted from another country. This is a great book not only for people who have adopted, or are adoptees, but for everyone!! Thanks to Mr. Clement for sharing such a well written, informative, life experience book with us."
3,Not for big rolls/wide ribbons,"I love wrapping gifts, so I had a stack of large rolls of ribbons that I wanted to organize. When this offer came along, I ordered 2 of the organizers. It took me a while to figure out how to assemble them, as there are no instructions. But I managed (with my husband's assistance), and then I found out that the organizers work fine for my smaller ribbon rolls, but the larger ones (the ones I buy at Costco) fit in there only when they are half empty and after I cut the cardboard down. A lot of extra work! Also, I could squeeze in only 1 roll of my wider ribbons per organizer, the width does not allow more. Summary: Not a bad item, but with limitations."
1,Not worth the high cost,"After purchasing this set I wonder why the cost is so high. This was briefly released and is very rare. Most of the episodes were from very early on in the series, and are nothing like the episodes I was used to watching. Very disappointed."
2,poop,There are good zombie games and there are bad zombie games and i hate to say this but this game has to go under bad zombie games.The gameplay itself is fun but when was it invented that zombies could shoot machine guns?Also the plot is not so good who wants to chase after a young man who does not want to show his face to until the very end.My last gripe about this game is the graphics are aful for a system that is supposed to have very good graphics.The reason i even rated this two stars is one it gets a star for booting up and two for having some creativity but not much creativity at all though do not get me wrong.
3,A Groovy Zombie Game,"a cool violent Game,but the game is too short its fun though,its worth 10 bucks"
1,Disappointing,"I bought the game because from the description I thought it was a gun game. It does let you use the Mad Catz gun but it makes no difference where you shoot, you might as well use a regular controller. It is NOT a gun game. It is an OK fighter in that mode, unfortunately in the arcade mode it is difficult to control and you get to the first boss level almost immediately. I recommend House Of The Dead 2, Confidential Mission, and Virtua Cop 2 instead of this title if you are looking for a shooter. Although I must say for the price it is still worth playing with if you are just looking for a Dreamcast game.From the description I believed it was a true gun game but it is not so I was disappointed."
5,Great 2 Player Action,"Zombie Revenge is an excellent game. It is like Streets of Rage, mixed with Resident Evil. Blasting zombies to bits with guns may sound fun, but it's even more fun when you're hooked in with your best bud, watching each others backs! The graphics and sound are great, and the chance for multiple paths adds replay value. The guns are so cool, you won't be able to wait until you find the next one. The story is good, but in a game like this, story doesn't matter too much anyway. If you are a fan of fighting games, RPG's, and especially adventure/action games, then this is a must for you. I hope this helps you make your descision."
3,THUMBS:MIDDLE,This game has blocky ... graphics. A stupid story. But the gameplay is (kinda) fun. The wepons were good(I like the drill and flame thrower). This game would not be on the top of my wish list/
4,A gaming high while it lasts!,"When I popped in Zombie Revenge, I turned out the lights and turned up the surround sound, and got prepared for a ride on the scary bus. This game has awesome graphics, and it turns out my inhibitions were correct, this game is scary. Think Resident Evil with better lighting, yeah. But the pace is much faster and it is a lot more fun. But every time I play, I get to a point that is impossible to beat. You will love this game, but you will die on any more than the very easy level setting."
5,My favorite John Frusciante album,"This has to be the hardest album Mr. Frusciante has done. It is many forms of rock sandwiched between layers of raw emotion. The thing I've noticed is how it differs *completely* from every other album he's done. While each of them have a different feel or tone to them, I must say that this one stands out. Another thing I liked about it is the heavy distortion he uses on most of the tracks, adding more to the Grungy feel of the album.I've listened to this album numerous times, and it's been hard to choose, but this is my favorite of all of John Frusciante's work.Highlights (for me) are: A Firm Kick, Emptiness, I'm Around, and Scratches."
4,Ladies and Gentleman...Mr. John Frusciante,"There's no doubt that John Frusciante could keep coming out with albums and keep everyone and anyone happy. His basis is not to be complicated, but to be expressive. Everyone of his albums is a true expression of John at his currents state of mind. This is another great album with more of John being great. It still has the same general feeling of his recent albums but a different approach to those feelings. I'd recommend it to anyone. John is a pure musician"
4,"A solid, interesting albumn","I am a RHCP fan for many years, and I have always appreciated Frusciante's contribution to the band. Until recently, I have never listened to his solo stuff. This is my 2nd solo album of his, and is much more to my liking. Some of his music strays very far off field compared with what we are familiar to hearing from him in the RHCP. I completely understand his need to explore and grow, but that doesn't mean that all of it is listenable. This album, although not funk-based like most of his playing, is very good. I listened to it 3 times last night. Some tracks stood out from the others during the 1st pass (#5), while others took a while -- over the course of multiple listens -- to sink in, but are also very good. What really stands out here is not only his command of the guitar, but his songwriting. His growth as a musician can be clearly seen since he was an 18yo kid when first entering the RHCP. Recommended."
2,JF's best? I've lost sense of it all.,"""What I saw"" written about the album was quite different form what I heard. Having listened to the album several times I can't figure out what it is that distinguishes JF's album from any talented school-rock-band. The harmonic surprises seem to be limited to a major-minor change and the all-to true statement ""and then foresight comes / I've lost sense of it all"" in what ought to be the album's title song ""Emptiness"".Please! No more Puff-the-magic-dragon lines ""I see clouds laughing again"" and more original ideas ""accidents have come straight to you / and you've changed your point of view""."
2,not up to Ms. Baudino's usual standards,"The _Water_ series is the worst series that Ihave read by Ms. Baudino. I was very disappointedin the series--the constant interruptions bythe ""author"" were extremely distracting. Theseries had a good plot, but I would not buy itagain."
2,Can't say that I liked it.,"I was very disappointed in the first of the Water series. It was a tough book to find & I didn't want to read the others out of order. I've already started reading the second one and I don't find it a lot better, though I'm more than willing to reserve judgement. ""O Greenest Branch"" is written in a style I find very distracting and its negativity or ""Darkness"" or whatever it is seems to go on for too long. I am a huge fan of all the other works of this author, so I hope Bks 2 & 3 get better."
1,Terrible,"Not up to Gael's usual standard at all. Its like she got tired of writing good stories and just jotted down whatever crap came into her mind. I didn't care about one single character in this book, not even Sari, who ALMOST came off as sympathetic, but was ruined by terrible writing."
2,"Informative but very dry, boring delivery","I bought this because I am a musician (sing & play flute & clarinet). I have always been a fan of Beethoven, and thought this book would be fascinating. While there is plenty of information about him given, it is written in such a way that I have yet to finish reading it. It is very dry, clinical, and quite frankly, boring. I had hoped for an entertaining, insightful read but have been sorely disappointed."
3,List of Songs,"I'm not sure why it's not included here with the details of this product, but here is the list of songs on this festive CD:1. Mistletoe & Holly2. O' Little Town of Bethlehem3. Santa Clause is Coming to Town4. The Christmas Song5. It Came Upon a Midnight Clear6. O' Come All Ye Faithful7. Jingle Bells8. White Christmas"
2,"some good tracks, but limited","there is no doubt that these two singers have talent. with that said, there is a soporific tone to this album that never quite lives up to the full promise. part of the drawback for me was the 70's-feel of the vocal arrangements, which are initially reminiscent of the carpenter's, but which later become more meandering for the ear. the first track, a medley of ""i will"" and ""maybe i'm amazed"" was charmed, but after several very similar song styles later on the cd I was disappointed. i was thrilled to hear the change with a cool song like ""god will"", but sadly that track is far too short when it had large potential. the tracks that stuck with me, namely ""if i'm lucky"" and ""hey there"", were inspired, but they were few between. pleasant cd, but limited."
5,Incredible...simply Incredible,"... With the first deep, rich and pure note that came from this heavenly voice, my knee's literally went weak and I had to hold onto the display to keep from falling. I had loved Andre Boccelli's voice but always heard a slight flaw in his voice. Josh is pure perfection. Vienna choir boy meets Pavorati. I got the CD immediately and I'm now an avid Grobanite! .... There are also some awesome video's and interviews to get to know more about the artist. Trust me, you will NOT be dissapointed. Blessings!"
5,Superb,"Josh is the best voice in America today. That fact that his CDs are selling millions verifies what all of us posters are saying about him. Also, I'm glad to see that he has dumped Charlotte Church permanently. Her presence was the only negative on an otherwise brilliant first album. BRAVO Josh."
5,A voice that could melt diamonds!!,"This is far and away the best CD I've ever owned because of the gorgeous quality of Josh's voice, his perfect phrasing, incredibly beautiful iridescent shimmering vibrato, the depth of emotion he expresses in every song, his beautiful Spanish and Italian pronunciation. There's no way I can say which song is my favorite; every one is intensely beautiful. His singing touches the deepest recesses of my soul like no other ever has. If you don't have this one yet, please get it now. You'll be sooooo glad! Also get Josh's PBS Great Performances Concert DVD/CD combination, ""Josh Groban in Concert""--another treat you owe yourself! I predict a hugely successful and very long career for Josh. If it were possible, I'd rate this CD many more stars than 5! P.S. This CD or his DVD/CD combo would make the perfect gift or gifts for anyone you love."
5,Wow!,This boy can sing! And can communicate emotion like no other singer I have ever heard. He is a gift from God that brightens my day every day. This cd is never out of my player.
5,great opera introduction for newbies,"I love all sorts of music from metal, pop, new age, classical, jazz, and now opera due to Josh and this new album. I have to say that this is single-handedly the most relaxing, beautiful music I have heard. I love all these songs on his album, but I absolutely crave Alla Luce Del Sole and To Where You Are. Now if I can only find this handsome, young lad in concert!"
5,Fantastic!,"Usually there are only a couple of songs on a CD I like. On this one, all are winners! Mr. Groban is one of the most talented and versatile performers to come in a very long time. Definitely an ""add on"" to your music collection."
5,One of the Best Voices Just for You,"When I first heard Josh's voice on the 2001 season finale of ""Ally McBeal,"" I was moved beyond words. His voice in ""You're Still You"" was so powerful and overwhelming that I found my eyes were filled with tears before he was done. And he thrilled me again with his performance of ""To Where You Are"" in the 2001 Christmas episode. [Thanks Ally!!] This entire album is filled with these types of amazing songs. His ability to move from a quiet yet strong beginning to a strong and full-bodied finish will truly move and thrill every listener. One of my best friends gave this CD to me as a gift. For those friends and family of yours who love GOOD music, this CD will truly be an awesome gift."
5,Mom was pleased with it...it must have been good,"This was a gift for my Mother, who likes Josh Groban. It came as advertised, in a timely manner; and all the tracks on the CD played. I believe she still has this, several years on from when I gave it to her."
5,Great debut album,"The collaboration of carefully crafted orchestrations, substantial content, and astonishing vocal talent have combined to produce one of the richest and most enjoyable listening experiences to arrive in many years. The music was lavish and varied, ranging from lyrical ballads sung in Italian to a sincere yet polished cover of Don McLean's Vincent. Josh Groban possesses a velvety, richly textured voice that brings each piece to life with a youthful freshness while maintaining respect for the music that is simply magic to behold in one so young. I enjoyed this CD immensely and would recommend this to music lovers of all ages and tastes."
5,beautiful,Josh Groban is so talented I can't stop crying! I always cry at beauty & this is purely beautiful.
5,Awe Inspiring,Josh Groban is truly unique. Once in a while God gives us someone really special and hopefully we are astute enough to appreciate him. You can't listen to this CD and not be moved by his powerful and inspiring vocal interpretations.I have never been so captivated by an artist and I know that I will be a devoted fan for life!
4,Congratulations Josh!,"When I first heard this young man, I was impressed by his voice, but listening to this CD, I am excited about future recordings. What a voice. What emotion. What power, and from someone so young. I will definitely buy more of his work."
5,I'm amazed,"I have never really listened to this type of music. Like many others I was introduced to Josh Groban's music through Ally McBeal. However, not last season, just last night. He sang To Where You Are on the Christmas episode. I was beyond touched. His voice is so beautiful that I am literally amazed by it. I've never felt a response to any music the way I did last night. I immediately got online and did a search and listened to a few other songs. I love everything I hear, even the songs that are in other languages. I may have no idea what he's saying in those songs but I *feel* it inside me. I can't wait to get my own CD and I will definitely be looking for future ones."
5,Where has he been all of my life.,"Josh Groban is absolutely the best thing to come along in male vocal music since Elvis. I can't believe how great he sounds on anything he sings whether or not its in English. He also does well with most artists he joins in with in duets and such. He sounded great with the Coors and also in Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring. The non-solo song which didn't mesh was ""The Prayer"" with Charlotte Church. She simply can't sing at the level needed to compliment Josh. He should avoid her in the future. But this album is a 5-star effort all the way by our new Golden Boy, Josh."
4,I have NEVER been THIS amazed...,"I am an avid Ally McBeal watcher, and I (of course) caught the season finale featuring Josh Groban. I was absolutely taken aback by this young man's voice. When he appeared again on Ally, I was ecstatic...but STILL didn't manage to catch his name! The crowning moment was on the Olympic closing ceremony, where I was absolutely awestricken by the performance with Charlotte Church (who is amazing in her own right!). I happened to be online, and as soon as I saw his name, I started downloading like a madwoman. The next night I went out and bought his CD anyways!! I have played it, and I have raved about it to everyone I know. I am insisting that they all go out and buy it. I am truly impressed and look forward to seeing MUCH MUCH more from this incredibly talented and mature young man!!!"
5,Up and coming Andrea Bocelli,"After seeing him on 20/20, I tried to buy his CD on the following Monday, only to find Media Play and Best Buy soldout! I kept shopping till I found it and he's worth it. A fabulous voice and moving interpretations of his selections. I highly recommend this CD, can you tell?"
3,A fresh start for a new artist,"I first heard Josh Groban was in Sarah Brightman's La luna concert video. I was astounded, what a wonderful voice, and he made a perfect match for Sarah's voice. In his debut album, Josh sounds more mature. But unfortunatly, the choice of materials/songs were not quite suited his voice. Most of the songs didn't allow his baritone voice to show up its true power and clarity. There are some tracks which I personally like, such as ""Gira con me"", ""Alejate"", ""Let me fall"", and his colaboration with Charlotte Church was magnificent. To conclude, I really think this is a worth-buy CD, and I believe Josh would come up with better albums in the future."
5,Josh Groban and Gary Clark/Piano!,Our 2 newest favorite CDs. The 2 best of 2002! Highly Recomended!! Beautiful Music...........! There hasnt been music this great in years........!
5,Melting Emotions,If you are looking for music to touch your emotions and hear a voice that can do that then this is the CD for you. Josh's voice is amazing and I hope he brings out another CD soon. He is just going to get better and better with age. Hopefully he will perform in concert in the States so that I may be able to hear him live. I hope you enjoy as much as I do.
4,Impressive Voice,I was very impressed by such great talent for such a young performer. His performances with the Corrs and Charlotte Church were wonderful. I especially loved his version of the Cinema Paradiso song. Worth getting.
4,Waves of velvet,"I first saw Josh Groban on a television program where they intereviewed him as well as David Foster. I thought he was a cute teenage boy, and I thought, UH-OH...another boy band singer. HOW WRONG! This boys voice is simply AMAZING. Don't be fooled or put off by his age. His voice is so beautiful. His version of Starry Starry night (Vincent), is pure magic, and replaces Jane Olivers version in my heart(Sorry Jane)! He possesses a voice so much more pure than the shmaltz of Boccelli, who I use to love, but he has gotten so carried away with his press. Let's hope young Groban stays true to himself and offers us fine opera as well as beautifully done ballads.Do yourself a favor and buy this CD! Fill the tub with a nice bubble bath, pour yourself a glass of wine, light some candles and put this CD on....a night of heaven! ENJOY!"
5,His Voice is Astounding,"This is certainly one of the most incredible voices I have ever heard and am amazed by his skill and techinque especially for someone so young. Gira Con Me and to Where You Are are two of my faves, although You're Still You is really awesome. The only drawback to this album is his duet with Charlotte Church. Her voice sounds like that of a weak choir girl on a classical album.Josh doesn't need her over-hyped reputation to make this album the classic it is. Altogether, this album is a classic and deserves your support."
3,"Pleasant, but definitely nothing special.","As a previous reviewer stated, one may hear this kind of singing at any Broadway audition/production. His voice is very common, and I find the music itself very 'pop' and uninteresting.Overall: Below average music, average voice, trite lyrics, but not unpleasant. Three stars."
2,Okay Everybody. Come back to Earth,"Sure, he has a pretty voice. But come on people. Give me a week and I guarantee I can find you a dozen, or maybe a hundred, twenty-year-olds who sing just like Josh Groban. This is pure marketing, just like Charlotte Church, or ""The VOICE"" or Bocelli, or any of the other psuedo-classical singers. And the material! Translate his repertoire into English and it's just a series of mediocre ballads.Josh Groban has great potential. He already has a lovely instrument. Now he needs to learn how to really sing. But why should he, if people like David Foster and David Kelly and John Williams are willing to welcome him into their company as some kind of amazing prodigy. Sorry to all the teeny boppers and adults who want a feeling of sophistication without any of the work, but he's nothing special."
1,No 'Joy' For this Man's Desiring,"After witnessing a sweet performance and sweeter song on television's Ally McBeal, I had such high hopes for this CD. But a testosterone clone of the robot Charlotte Church was not on my agenda. Turgid ballads, irritating arias, a monotone baritone, and a misguided remake of ""Vincent [Starry Starry Night]""; you have to wonder just who is responsible for all this. Then you notice roll call - David Foster, Walter Afanasieff, Richard Marx...then it all makes sense. My grade: C"
1,i am suprised i acutally bought this,"I first heard of this guy from a duet he did with charlotte church that my mom had a cd of. I thought he had a good voice so i saw this cd and i bought it i could only sit through it once it was so boring and all the same. I got this when i was into classical music do not get me wrong i still like classical music like bach, mozart and so on but this dude sucks. The only decent song on here is stary stary night but he ruins it with overproducion and expressing no emotion in his voice, the don mclan original version is so much better. This cd was in the back of my cd collection for years untill my aunt lost hers so i gave her mine she gave me joshua tree instead which is overrated and kinda of boring but atleast it is not embrassing to have in my collection like this boy josh."
5,The Best!!=-),"I can't wait for the next album from this young prodigy! To hear this kind of music from a young man of this generation is just marvelous! Josh, keep up the excellent work! You have the opportunity to bring this beautiful voice to young listeners. Perhaps they will follow in your footsteps. They will learn clarity and respect for fine music."
5,Josh Groban,"I never have ever bothered to review a cd but this one just blew me away!! I love all categories of music but I must say, once hearing John Groban, it has left me wanting to hear more of his work. His voice, the arrangement of the instrumental is excellent. His voice is very powerful and rich. This cd takes one away to another place entirely when listening to it. One does not have to be a fan of an operatic baritone. Josh Groban can be appreciated by fans of many types of music and all ages. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed every track of any cd but this one is an exception. Very unique indeed!"
5,One for the ages,"Unlike many others, I like the duet with Charlotte Church, which is interesting because I am no fan of hers at all. Her almost raspy weak voice contrasts just right with Groban's silky smooth power. It works and highlights his performance rather than taking away from it.And what a voice he has! The first time I heard it on Ally McBeal it just blew me away.A similar story line has been done so many times where character gets his chance to sing. The problem with the plot line is that the singer's voice is merely good. But with Groban, his performance was one for the ages. When Ally tells him afterwards that his voice was the most beatiful she has ever heard, the compliment is totally believable -- she's not exaggerating.Get this album!"
5,Josh Groban is amazing!,"This CD is beautiful. Every single song on it is wonderfully sang, and played. Josh Groban's voice is full, and rich, and flows elegently. The version of The Prayer that he does with Charlotte Church is breathtaking. His range goes all the way from semi-operatic songs such as Alla Luce Del Sole, and Gira Con Me Questa Notte, to Don McClain's Vincent (Starry Starry Night), and To Where You Are. A true delight to listen to!"
5,a beautiful resonation...,"Sometimes you hear a song on the radio, in the mall, on a friend's CD player..a song you swore you've never heard before but it strikes a note somewhere within you...a note that seems to remind you of an earlier time, place, person or feeling, and you immediately need to know what this song is that has effected you.Groban doesn't just strike a note, he strikes a chord. That chord seems to resonate perpetually, and before you know it you'll be listening at every chance you get, and humming every time you're away from the music. Josh sings a type of music at such a polar opposite of what our mainstream society is used to these days that it seems to be a miracle that it has become so popular. Why? It's in tune with something inside of us..something creative, curious, truth-seeking. It can't be described, but felt. The music is there, now make your own interpretation."
4,Great Debut Album,"As a pop singer, Groban posesses a bass baritone voice of estounding quality. I first heard him from Brightman's ""La Luna"" concert on PBS and a second time I came into the room where my parents were watching ""Ally McBeal."" I heard this voice so incredible I waited for the end credit and found ""Josh Groban."" The name hasn't left me since. As a rightwing avid opera listener with a library of recordings from such giant living legengs as Pavarotti, Domingo, and Te Kanawa, I've grown to like the new interpretations. Maybe because these music are in my generation? A great voice is a great voice is a great voice! ""You are Still You"" is the song I heard on ""Ally McBeal"" and it is a great song. ... Well done Josh! I look forward to hearing and seeing your name in the upcoming years as you progress and further your voice."
5,Fantastico!,"I have no comments regarding the Charlotte Church song/debacle, beyond what has already been said. I must say this about this CD - I bought it last Thursday, and have been unable to put it down since then, five days ago. Each time I listen to songs like ""Alejate"" and ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"", I am moved almost to tears. Groban embues each song with a piece of his soul, and makes my spirit want to break out of my body and soar on each note. The Coors add a hip dimension that complements Groban's fantastic voice in ""Canto Alla Vita"". When I'm at home I blast this CD so the neighbors can hear it. Needless to say, I have since already learnt several of the songs. The only other voice to move me in recent years like this is Andrea Bocelli (whose voice has a similar timbre and soul, in my limited estimation.)"
5,SUPERB!!,"Just the BEST! The best voice I have heard in many, many years. The voice of an Angel. Buy this CD...you will not be sorry...you will run out and buy copies for all your friends as well!"
5,What a voice!,I first heard Josh Groban on Larry King Live and was entranced. His voice is remarkably rich. This music moves me to tears. I wish he was singing to me!
5,WOW,"As a 24 year old male, it is unbelieveable to hear such a mature voice coming from a young man. Everyone in the world should be able to enjoy this music. Josh is wonderful, and if you are contemplating whether to buy this CD, it is a no-brainer! BUY IT! You will not regret it."
5,If there's one album you'll buy this month...,"This one would be it!I picked up the CD because a friend recommended it to me. The first song was sufficient to keep me glued on my sofa and listen intently. When the third song came, ""You're Still You"", I was totally bowled over. It seemed that with every song, Josh Groban kept on improving! By the fifth song, ""A Breath Away"", came on, I can't help but be teary-eyed. (I can imagine Nicholas Cage in the final scenes of ""City of Angels"" quietly weeping with his head looking up to the sky, questioningly...)If emotions can truly, fully be translated and incorporated into a song, Josh Groban and his composers did it really well. To say his voice is angelic is an understatement.There's gotta be more albums."
5,AMAZING CD....PERIOD.,"I am so sick of opera snobs searching for someone to take a potshot at. Josh Groban is NOT an opera singer. Maybe one day...certainly not now. And his CD is not in any way an opera CD (I certainly have never found it in the classical section). It does, however, take the formula of pop music that everyone is so sick of and destroys it, leaving the listener with what can only be described as an optimism for the future of music. He's 21 with a voice that is extraordinary. Sure to be one of the greatest in the next 10 years. I hope everyone enjoys as I did."
5,Chicago Music Fan,"This CD nails it for Josh Groban! What an outstanding mixture of music to fully introduce this incredible talent! I can't wait for his next and, of course, for a live performance! I wish him all the success his natural gift deserves."
5,"Thank you, Amazon for introducing me to Josh","Great voice - great songs! I would never have discovered this artist as this is not normally the kind of music I buy, but found it somehow through an Amazon recommendation. I'll be looking for his next album"
2,Yawn,"Nice voice, boring song after boring song after boring song. If you like rock, alternative, funk, jazz or classical, you probably won't like this. It's easy listening and trumped up. I will be trading it in to the Used Record store after one listen."
1,The voice is flat,his voice is empty and flat. he sings with little to no emtion. he's simply dictating the words and i cannot recommend his cd. it seems that all the 5 star reviews here are all ally macbeal fans that were watching the show. need i say more about their tastes and low intellectual level. i returned the cd. don't bother with this one. i'm saving you alot of trouble returning it. the music orchestration is also inferior and at times actually sounded staticy. Bottomline: refrain.
2,oof this is schmaltzy wannabe opera,"Josh Groban may have some classical training, but he is FAR from being anywhere close to operatic. Maybe one problem is that he was only 17 when he made this album, the operatic tenor isn't in his prime until he is in his late thirties or early forties.However, my biggest problem with this album is the soft pop twist Josh puts on his song choices. I find that his musical sensibilities are unsophisticated and very un-classical. Andrea Bocelli, though still not an operatic singer, has a much more sophisticated taste than this pop lemming. If you like ""artists"" such as Charlotte Church and Celine Dione, then you'll love Joshy boy. However, if you want to graduate to a more refined pallette, you may want to consider Andrea Bocelli, or, dare i say, the original: Luciano Pavarotti."
1,Josh Groban Sucks,"This guy is horrible . . .see my review of his album on Epinions.com . . .he can't sing----you are a total idiot of you like this fool's voice. He's not a baritone, not a tenor---he's nothing but another teen heartthrob with some training from some other idiots that no nothing about the voice. Ha!!!"
5,Josh will become the GREATEST!,"That's if he hasn't already made it. As far as I'm concerned, he already has. I first heard his song ""Where You Are"" on the radio and didn't catch his name from the announcer. A few days later, I have easy listening tuned in on my television and this time, when I hear his voice, I scramble to write down the name of the cd. I hurried out to purchase it and if it is possible to do so, I may have worn the cd out already. I play it over and over. Every time I hear ""Where You Are"" I want to break down in tears. His voice is heavenly. I can just imagine him singing ""Where You Are"" in a duet with Celine Dion (also my favorite female singer). If these two managed to get together to make a cd of love songs, the whole world would go crazy. Do yourself a favor and get this one. It's a winner all the way. You go JOSH!"
4,"Starry, Starry Night","Josh Groban transforms this tribute to Vincent Van Gogh, originally heard on Don McClean's ""American Pie"" album, into a powerful, loving sketch of this tragic genius. I bought this CD for this song; the other presentations are beautiful bonuses."
5,Unbelievable voice,Bought this CD last year and play in constantly. Saw Josh in concert in October and he is absolutely fabulous. The range that this guy has is unbelievable. I don't know anyone who is not in love with Josh's voice.
2,Is it just me?,"I don't get it. If you like modern ""Lite"" Broadway musicals, you'll probably think he's great. I don't. He's pleasant enough but I think you need to be attracted to him to buy in to the whole package. Again, I don't. Check out Mario Frangoulis if you want to hear a voice."
5,Simply perfection,"I went to look for this CD after seeing Josh Groban on 20/20 I think it was. Since I don't watch Ally McBeal I missed his intro to the television community. Alas, when I went looking for the CD, it seemed that many people were already on the Josh Groban bandwagon...it was nowhere to be found. Finally after about 2 weeks I was able to get a copy and was completely mesmerized. Unlike a previous reviewer, I can't wait to see Josh perform at the Opera. Although not a tenor, I would certainly like to hear his performance of some of my favorite Placido Domingo arias...Tosca, Turandot, etc."
5,An exciting sensation,"This album sends chills down my spine...in a good way of course. I've always been a rock 'n roller and have expanded my musical avenue to other types as well, but it wasn't until I watched the PBS special featuring Josh that I really fell in love with his voice and this genre of music. Josh is fabulous...for only being 21 years old, he sings with an air of experience that further exemplifies his beautiful nature. This man has a true gift...I'm enthralled by each and every track on this wonderful cd... I've been listening to it for the last 3 hours and I haven't gotten tired of it, so that alone should tell you his music is a very free-flowing, relaxing, and just plain beautiful. Become enchanted! Check this cd out...its definitely worth the purchase, or at least a listen or two on his site before you buy it. Hope you enjoy it...I certainly am!! : )"
5,Josh Groban,"What a fresh new voice. This CD is emotional and beautiful. Josh seems to have a voice beyond his years. One could believe he has mountains of experience. Charlotte Church fans should be proud of her duo with Josh. It is my sincere hope he produces more music of this quality... My best to Josh Gorban, I wish him success."
5,Josh Groban,The cd came sooner than anticipated and it is great listening. I plan to buy from this seller again. Great service.
5,new discovery for me,I first heard Josh Groban on TV when he was on a special with Charlotte Church. I love their voices together. His CD is very soothing and I loved listening to it. But I wish he and Charlotte would do a CD together.

4,Josh Groban Review,Josh Groban has a fantastic voice for such a young man. He is placed in the some category as Andre Bocelli and Russel Watson. His new cd is great and I look forward to seeing much more of him in the future. He will definitely have a long career ahead of him.
4,Josh Groban is good,"My music has often been compared to Josh Groban - we both have that easy-listening sound to our voices, as well as he and I being both classically trained (but I have a more commercial pop quality). Maybe that's why he's the only guy singer I like; I dunno, but anyway...Groban's debut is a great release, but I think it's for more adult listeners who appreciate the Italian arias that he sings."
5,Hypnotic!,"Its not often a voice brings tears to your eyes and pure joy to your heart and soul--Josh Groban is capable of transporting you into heaven. In a time when the whole world is in upheaval, Josh transports me away from all the stress and takes me to a place where there is beauty and love. Thank you David Kelly (Ally McBeal) for introducing him to the TV public. Hope there are many more CD' from Josh."
5,Simply incredible....,"Josh Groban is one of those rare artists whose talent is so tremendous, so astounding, that it is hard to put into words how extraordinary they are. Josh's voice, which seems almost out of place in such a young man, is hauntingly beautiful.While his English songs are the more well known, all of the songs on this album are wonderful and well worth listening to.P.S. Be warned, once you buy this album, you will be unable to stop playing it. I listened to it non-stop for the first week; while at home, in the car, on my way to class. I couldn't get enough."
5,You NEED this CD in your collection!,"Sure, a good portion of the tracks are in Italian with one in Spanish, but that's the beauty-how Josh's voice flows over the music. Why not learn Italian?? Each song has a unique flavor-the romantic ballads, the soft ""Vincent (Starry, starry night)"" the funky ""Canto alla Vita"" with the Coors-Josh can sing it all..."
5,A Voice for Your Soul,"I think this young man's voice is truly phenomenol! It cuts right through the clutter of every day life and reaches the soul. The wonderful ballads, the soaring songs sung in Italian, even a slight touch of classical. . .the musicality of his phrasing, the emotion he puts into every word is astounding! This CD has something for everyone!"
3,Not that impressed,"Josh Groban is talented and has a good voice but it lacks depth and range. He also sounds his age - which isn't a bad thing but this style of music usually sounds better with a more mature and powerful voice. He's great for the under 25 female crowd and people who think Les Miserables is opera but if you want a truly beautiful AND powerful voice, try Mario Frangoulis instead."
2,All 5 stars??? I don't think so.,"I listened to the CD. First off - The voice is amazing. In fact, when I saw him on Ally McBeal, I fell in love. LOVE, I TELL YOU! But the song selection is not very interesting. And it's not because most of them are in Italian....they just don't suit him. I have a hard time putting this in words other than saying that he sounds like he doesn't mean what he's singing....even in Italian. Just blah. The one song I keep listening to, however, is ""To Where You Are"", and even that one isn't spectacular spectacular.MY SUGGESTION: Listen to it before you buy it! ..."
2,Don't see what the fuss is about,"After all the hype I purchased the cd. I mean, it wasn't bad, but on the other hand I wasn't very impressed either. Nothing really grabbed me or stood out.The last duet song better done by the original artists would have been better left untouched.Maybe people notice at first glance because their not accustomed to hearing classical music or vocalists, (coming from their pop genres), or their impressed he's an American or he's young.But once that is gotten over with, what you're left with is a typical classical vocalist in a large international sea of other classical vocalists; many of whom with better voices but didn't have the American publicity machine behind them. He should take advantage of this while he can, because with the next album the novelty will wear off."
5,Remarkable voice,"The maturity of Groban's voice is amazing. I can listen to this album over and over. Beautiful arrangements, great selections, beautiful duets. One of my favorite albums of the year."
5,Voice of an Angel,"I made my living singing and dancing for 20 years and have never heard a vocalist I couldn't find something wrong with. I usually prefer female vocalists to male, but Josh!!! Perfect tone quality, projection, dynamics, range... It didn't take long for me to decide I want to hear this angel's voice as I leave this world and enter the next. Every song Josh sings is produced perfectly (much to the contributions of David Foster). Each instrument compliments Josh Groban's angelic voice without error. To enter heaven, hearing this angelic voice, is my greatest desire in life!!! Josh has not recorded a SINGLE number that didn't move me more than any other. I would buy a whole Josh Groban album just to get ONE new song from him!!"
3,Mostly boring,"I can't believe Roark413 already wrote my review of this CD. I was so disappointed with the CD. Josh's voice is fabulous; his delivery is mostly flat and uninteresting. I keep playing it over and over waiting for it to ""catch me up"", but it doesn't happen. The one song I really like and wish there were more like it is Let me Fall. That is the only one to me that he really emotionally connects with. The rest, he is just mouthing the words. Oh well, I hoped to be blown away. But I'm not. Can't wait until he gains some emotional depth. Maybe he should study and sing opera. But without the feeling he'd be boo-d out of the house."
5,A Winner CD!,"Josh Groban sings with such feeling! My favorite song on this CD is ""Vincent"" although they are all excellent. A very talented young man, bound to go far."
5,Get on the Josh Groban bandwagon!,"Seldom does a new young artist affect me in the way that Josh Groban has. I love to listen to this CD over and over again. The Italian songs are even better than the English. I can't wait to see what develops from this talented young man - and I can't wait until his 2nd CD comes out. Buy this - - - Buy 3 or 4 and give them to your friends - spread the word - He is a fantastically gifted, talented young man. Josh is headed for greatness!"
5,ENJOYABLE!!!!!!,We find Josh Groban's music very enjoyable and this one is no exception. You won't be sorry buying this one.
3,3.5 Stars...Great Voice but Over Produced,"Josh has a great voice, what is left to be desired by this album is to hear is voice in an unadulterated state. His vocals are def. over produced.Also, the song selection is OK, but there are def. songs out there that would complement his voice better. This album left me with the impression that Mr. Groban was going to be marketed as an Andrea Bocceli."
5,Im in LOVE with his voice!,"I just wanted to say How much I love Josh!I listen to him sing and I am in Awe. Im not a big fan of classical music, but the songs that are in English on the CD, I play over and over again. Louder and Louder each time. <[...]BR>Keep up the good work Josh. ...I hope I hear more songs from you that are played on the radio.Your THE BEST!!!!Janine N.Y."
5,Josh Groben,"This is a phenomenal CD!! Love each & EVERY song on it! When Josh Groben sings he literally makes you FEEL each & every word in EVERY SONG he sings. His music will touch your very soul. His voice will reach into the very depth of your heart and you WILL FEEL the words, the melody and the meaning of the song like you've never felt before. He is TRUELY a gifted singer & I am looking forward to ALL his future CD's."
5,Beyond words...,"Ally McBeal introduced me to Josh. When he performed ""You're Still You"" at the prom, I was hooked. The full version of it is even better, which I though was impossable.Josh has a georgous voice for one so young. He rivals Michael Crawford...I can't say enough. I just love Josh's voice..."
5,Josh Groban,"This man truly has the voice of an angel. Hearing him sing makes the fine hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I recently told my sister that if my favorite operatic singer before Josh made me melt, this man makes me evaporate!"
5,Voice of an Angel!,"There are no words that I can really describe Josh Groban's talent of singing. He is the utmost most gifted vocalist I have ever heard in the longest time. As someone who is a true lover of music, I would highly recommend Josh Groban to anyone who will listen. With such a powerful voice that will knock you off your feet, Josh Groban will bring a smile to your lips or a tear to your eye. And ohhh, the black curly hair is just gorgeous. I wonder if that's natural???Enjoy!"
5,Simply beautiful music...,"I was more than overwhelmed and awed by Josh Roban's rich, powerful voice. This extremely moving music filled me with emotion... It is, indeed, a high quality album that everyone should have. I'm just thrilled I came across it. Without it, I would surely be missing something wonderful. 'You're still you', 'alla luce del sole', and 'un amore per sempre' are just lovely. I'd rate this album higher than 5 stars if I could. I'll be the first one buying Josh Roban's next one!!!"
4,Powerful voice,"This is a wonderful CD, but the liner notes provide neither any information about the performer, nor English translations of the Italian lyrics. I find those omissions inexcusable."
4,Not as Good,"This CD is good, but not a good or as well recorded as Josh's ""Closer"" album which I would rate as 5 stars."
3,Needs More Voice Training,"I have listened to his recording and although he is enormously talented,he lacks the depth of a well trained operatic tenor. Right now his voice is ordinary but with training it can become quite the opposite. It is not fair to compare him to Bocelli at the present time. Bocelli does not have the depth in his voice either!. It is my feeling that Josh should continue his voice training to avoid becoming ""just another young pop star"""
3,"Good, but not great","I was told I would fall in love with this CD upon listening to it. I do love his voice and I do love the music. The first few songs in Italian were wonderful! However, when I listened to the first song in English...the words were so shallow! There is no depth to the meaning of (most) of these songs. Did a 10-year-old write the lyrics? He seems to have great passion in his voice, too bad it is wasted on such meaningless words! I will continue to listen to his music in Italian, at least I can use my imagination!"
4,Beautiful voice,"Josh Groban has a voice that could make angels cry with happiness, and he delivers the goods in this cd. My only complaint is the prevalence of Italian opera...Why does almost everyone with an opera-quality voice have to sing Italian opera??! But the full,rich notes almost completely make up for it. He has the best voice and range that I have heard in a long, long time."
4,Good Young Tenor,"I like at least 3 songs on this CD. Josh has a very projective voice, but I've noticed his range is not too diverse. He can master his nature voice, but limited on hitting high tenor notes. He managed to record a duet with the legendary Barbra Streisand, wherein Barbra's voice towers over Josh voice, but this is expected. Josh has a while to go, but he is impressive for his age. If you want to hear an excellent tenor who can hit all sorts of notes buy the CD ""Only You"" from Alessandro Safina. Mr. Safina has an amazing voice and great song selections. In my opinion, Alessandro is more diverse than Bocelli and Watson."
3,Average,"I have both of Russell Watson's albums and this album from Josh and to be honest cannot see how anyone can compare Josh to Russell. Josh is very thin in his high notes and also has no power. His ""Prayer"" is very good, mostly because of Charlotte Church. I admit that the 3 albums have none of the same songs but you can certainly here the differences. I guess the main difference is Josh is not a tenor and Russell is..."
3,just OK,"I swear I will never understand these reviews. This guy is getting a ton of great reviews, and poor Russell Watson is getting slammed. Russell blows this guy away; more power, range, and better song selection. That's not to say Josh isn't decent for his age. I guess it was worth buying."
3,English/Spanish combo,"Josh Groban has a wonderful voice. I chose this CD because I wanted some of his music. I just wish I had paid more attention to the songs because I would have realized that half the songs are in spanish. Since I don't understand spanish half the songs are lost on me.That being said, he's voice is still beautiful and he's a hottie!"
5,Simply the Best,"What a great voice & a great album. There is not a bad song on this CD. Every song is well done & well performed. Groban has a stellar voice. When I first saw him on 'Ally MacBeal', I doubted it was him actually singing. That's a testament to the power & strength of his voice.Unfortunately, this is all we have right now. Hopefully I will soon be adding the new Josh Groban to my CD holder."
5,So Beautiful,This man touches my soul when he sings. His voice is so powerful that I don't even need to understand the words to understand the songs. He is truly talented.
5,JOSH GROBAN! YEA!,"I heard him on the radio, not knowing who he was, and he blew my mind! I also saw him on OPRAH, and he was even more spectacular! I am planning on buying his 1 of a kind CD, soon!Go get it now, and don't miss out."
