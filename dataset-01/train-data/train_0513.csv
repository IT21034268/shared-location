3,Not for the butterfingers,"I got these for my birthday, and for the two months I had them they worked fine. Unfortunately, the controller tends to lget dropped or fall off of your belt loop and jerk on the cord. Eventually the cord just came right out. They are fine quality, but if you tend to be a bit of a butterfingers, I'd suggest something else."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought these headphones in a hurry withoud much consideration or research, and I deeply regret it. While the sound is all right most of the time, the bass becomes a buzzing sound when the noise-cancelling mechanism is enabled (which just creates a fuzzy backround sound that does next to nothing). In addition, they're quite uncomfortable, being to tight, and you can't lean your head back without pushing them off your ears unless whatever you are sitting in has a protruding headrest. The one thing I did like particularily about them is the headphone cord length. Not too long, not too short, but with that obnoxious little box that stores the battery for noise-cancellation and the switch, it gets annoying.SOUND QUALITY: 6/10 w/ out noise-cancelling, 2/10 w/ noise- cancellingCOMFORT: 5/10VALUE: 4/10OVERALL: 2/10DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY"
2,You call this noise-canceling? Oh puh-leeeez,"I bought these for a relatively cheap price at best buy. Unfortunately, in this case you get what you pay for. The ""noise-canceling"" feels like someone's simply turned the volume up a bit. When a friend sat next to me with the headphones on and whispered something, I could actually hear him! This is hopelessly inadequate for anyone wanting a modicum of silence."
1,Worst Headphones EVER!,"These headphones are unbearably uncomfortable, and they barely do any for noise-cancelling. They pinch the tops of your ears, and the way they sit on your head, you can not sit back while wearing them. I tried to wear them on a plane, but had to lean forward to do so. The noise cancelling only works a tiny bit, as I could clearly hear ALL noise around me. They turned the airplane noise into slightly quieter airplane noise. Not worth it!"
1,These things STINK!,"These headphones are unbearably uncomfortable, and they barely do anything for noise-cancelling. They pinch the tops of your ears, and the way they sit on your head, you can not sit back while wearing them. I tried to wear them on a plane, but had to lean forward to do so. The noise cancelling only works a tiny bit, as I could clearly hear ALL noise around me. They turned the airplane noise into slightly quieter airplane noise. I also had problems with the sound breaking up when jostled. Not worth it!"
1,Junk!!!!,"Every now and again I buy a product without doing my home-work. This was one of those times and I definitely regret it. There is no evidence of sound cancelling at all wih the poorly designed switch in either position. All I get is the clck that indicates the electronics are powering up or down. Sounds are all the same. If you are in the market for sound-cancelling earphones, don't buy these."
2,Sounds ok - design bad,"I don't retun many things, but these had to go.The design is awful:- Pinches the tops of your ears- The battery box has a clip for your belt, but the wire is too short to reach my belt (I'm 6' tall) - so when walking it would rip off my head when attached my belt.- When not attached to my belt, it would swing around like other users have said and rip it off my head - same effect - but I looked like a major idiot.- Didn't fold for storage.They sound OK, N/C was adequate on a plane. But there was no reason to put this battery box in the middle of the cord. I returned these and got a nice Sony pair with all the controls on the headphones themself."
2,Disappointing,"Comfort is fine for a while. Sound is all right until you turn on the noise cancelling. First of all, it doesn't block all that much noise. Second, it kills the sound quality: the treble becomes real harsh; cymbals and ""t""s and ""s""s, etc in vocals become painful to listen to. Also, there is no shock protection: if you're in a car, for example, and it's a bumpy ride, you'll find that the sound skips often. If you're looking for good noise reduction, I would strongly recommend getting a pair of earbuds that seal off the noise, such as Shure's E series or Etymotic Research's ER6i's."
1,stunned,I was stunned when I opened these headphones up and used them for my MP3 player. All I can say is they were terrible. My ear buds that came with my MP3 player sounded better than these headphones. The Philips HN050 is not worth the money. I will be returning these immediately.
3,Decent choice for the money,"In it's price class, these headphones kinda do the trick. The noise cancelling feature is shoddy at best. I was borrowing some open ear Aiwa HP-CN5 and I wish I'd have spent the extra money. I would highly recommend the Aiwa's over these. Trust me when I say the savings these provide the wallet do not compensate for the quality difference."
1,"Poor design, good sound and mine broke soon","The design is terrible: the neckband is uncomfortable if you are sitting in a high-backed chair, such as an airplane seat. The position of the noise-canceling switch is awkward, at least for jogging on a treadmill. Until my iPod ear buds broke, I used those while running. The Philips' noise canceller is right in the middle of the cord so if you clip it to your shirt, you have about two feet of cord and have to stick close to the treadmill or you'll get your mp3 player pulled from the shelf.The quality of sound was excellent but I enjoyed it only for a few weeks until they broke. One of the wires broke somewhere in the headphone cord and I guess it's because of the switch placing stress on the cord while running. My recommendation is to get these only if you won't be using them on an airplane. If so, go with noise-canceling headphones with the battery in the earpiece."
4,Good,"I read the other reviews, but i thought the headphones are very comfortable. When you first buy them, the foam that surrounds your ear is hard, because it is new, but you just move it around a litle bit, and it is feels good.<br /><br />the noise cancelling is pretty good, but it could be better. The reason it doesn't work completely is you need to have the music on. With the music off, it probably halves the sound, but with it on (at a reasonable level, not very low or very high) you can block out most of the noise.<br /><br />They sound good, but they dont have the base response i thought they would. You probably need to turn on a base booster to get the base you want.<br /><br />If your looking for a good alternative to the very high priced noise cancelling headphones, get these."
1,Poor quality product,"These headphones have good sound quality in fact the best I have heard in a behind the ear headphone, but after 6 months the right ear just quit working. The headphones were never damaged and I called philips and they said I only had a 6 month warranty and it was up so they were ""really sorry"". I only jogged with these headphones there is no reason the right ear should just stop working after 6 months, plus I received them asa gift, after they came out so my family paid the full 50."
2,Wanna blow 50 bucks on an inferior product?!,"For the most part these headphones do what they are advertised to do - cancel noise. But while walking or if you hit a speed bump while in a car, the sound breaks up and you can hear the digital artifacts, similar to when streaming low-bitrate music on the Net. This is just not acceptable for any type of headphones. Look at Sony's MDR-NC6 or MDR-NC11, either is a higher quality headphone."
2,"Poor design, great sound","I bought these headphones for my pc and have to say that they are the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever had. The sound quality, however, was great--though not enough to deal w/ the comfort issue. I will be returning them."
2,Worth about $12,"Pros:Noise cancellation is decent.Good sound quality for the price.Cons:Earpads are inflexible and uncomfortable.Stiff headband - can't be used with a pillow on a plane; I can't really move my head around too much when walking around either, otherwise the headband pushes the ear pads around.Way overpriced for what you're actually getting."
1,not worth the money eventhough they are relatively cheap,"These headphones were very disappointing. the battery box is very annoying. when the noise canceling feature is switch on, you get a annoying hissing sound. I've used them almost everywhere from train to plane and with the noise canceling feature turned on, it just seems to increase the volume a bit and nothing more. You can still hear a lot of background noise. This product simply didn't live up to its claim."
2,Mediocre and Broken after 2 months,"It was working fine, I'm no big sound guru, but when after two months one of the earphones stops working, that's just bad construction. I don't recommend these to anyone. Plus they are a bit uncomfortable and the sound cancellation just seems to raise the volume."
2,Not worth the money,"The sound quality is pretty good -- about the same a earbuds that cost half as much.The headband comfort is not bad, but takes a little getting use to.The ear phones move off of your ear if rest your head on the back of a chair (or airplane seat).If you are looking for noise cancelation you will be very disappointed. There is some but not much."
5,Great value believe it or not!!,"When forst buying these, I was a little reluctant. I mean, $50 for headphones? But, after trial and error I finally bought them. SO GLAD I DID!! The bass is the best I've ever heard. My father bought $350 earbuds, and even asked if he could borrow mine. The noise canceling feature is also awesome. I play highschool basketball, and these headphones can block out the chattering of our JV and Varsity (teenage) girls' basketball teams. I don't know that else to say. They're comfertable, lightweight and WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,"Sound is pretty good, HORRIBLE design","Contrary to what a lot of reviewers have said, I thought the sound that these headphones provided was pretty good. I listen to a lot of music with a lot of different devices (speakers, headphones, and uh... i guess that's it) and I can't fairly say these had bad sound. But the design of these is terrible. As much as I like how they sound, I can only wear these headphones for about 10 minutes before my ears start to ache. Also, the battery box is incredibly annoying, and the cable is far too short to have my iPod in my pocket and have the headphones on with any comfort."
1,Don't buy...,"These headphones really hurt my ears. My ears have to bend in order to fit into these headphones, after about 20 mins my ears start to really hurt. Secondly, the battery that came with it died after a few weeks.. as someone else said, the battery thing is in the wrong place, it gets in the way, is heavy and weighs the cord down, and it gets tangled in stuff. I don't recommend this headphones."
2,bad product,after 6 plus hours still cannot get it working now vendor will not take it back don't buy this product
4,Brassy Jazz Rock From England,Your City Is Falling is my favorite song from these guys i just love it. Now im not sure but i dont think this band used a Trumpet or Trombone i think they had a few different saxes. They were a very good band i still cant get used to JW. Hodgkinson's voice
4,Good stuff,"I've had this album since shortly after its release. The music is tight, the lead vocals are strong and distinctive. There are two songs that I consider to be classics on the album: Your City is Falling; and Sunday Sad. They both used to get play on a Twin Cities FM rock station back in the days when FM was the lesser listened to format. I still play those songs frequently on my Ipod and enjoy them immensely. Comparisons are made to Blood, Sweat, and Tears as well as Chicago. They are fair, but If's sound is still unique. Highly recommended."
5,Really cute,Very cute shoes . Every time I go out with these shoes on I get complements. love these shoes have two pair .
3,Forget about historical accuracy,"The irony is if the USA did not have the ridiculous one drop rule, the real Sally Hemmings was about as 'black' as Wesley Snipes is white. However close your eyes and forget the facts ,this is entertaining piece of work, but Jennifer Beales/Rashida Jones would be more realistic since they look more white than black. Not surprised Hemmings caught Jefferson eye since she was biologically if not legally his sister in law, she probably looked like his late wife. As for great romance, please, white slave owner and black slave girl, guess where the power lies and who really gets to say no,stay outta my bed?"
2,ordinary,"This is not a compelling story as i had hoped, just a glossy version and very predictable story"
3,Sally Hemings,I thought it was pretty good for its time period and the time it was made. I thought the actors were very good.
1,Godawful,"Just terrible. Makes claims that not even the most ardent Sally Hemings promoter believes. Turns Sally's brother James into some sort of martyr to the cause of political correctness. Has Jefferson (atrociously played by the completely out-of-place Sam Neill) traipsing around with Sally Hemings in public in a completely unrealistic way. Given the almost certain fact that Jefferson really did have children with Sally Hemings, this premise might have made an interesting and insightful movie. Instead, the producers used it as an excuse for creating a complete historical romance fantasy that tries at the same time to be titillating and preachy, and maybe it succeeds--but at the cost of any degree of historical accuracy. If you want a movie about Jefferson, get the much less awful Jefferson in Paris, which at least has beautiful production values and nice music."
4,Sally Hemings final days,"Good acting and performace throughout. One question: Where did Sally Hemings lived from the time Thomas Jefferson died until her own dead, since the entire state was lost?"
5,Brilliant dialogue and setting!,"Having watched the movie several times, Sally Hemmins is a great eye opener for those who are not familiar with US history especially during the slavery era. The events and story line were pretty consistent. The other version of Sally Hemmins filmed by Nick Nolte wasn't impressive. But the casting, dialogue, costumes, scenery and most of all the depiction/irony of Southern Slavery of 'Sally Hemmins: Ana American Scandal' is/was brilliant. I'll give definitely give it 5 STARS."
1,There is nothing romantic about slavery,"This movie romanticizes a slave master's sexual union and there is no romance in rape. Young female slaves had no right of refusal if a master decided to bed them.Thomas Jefferson's Virginia was the first colony to have laws on slavery that were adopted by the other colonies. These included making slavery lifelong and hereditary, thus creating a permanent slave caste without legal rights until Constitutional Amendments.Election night 2008 was historic and memorable because it was Jefferson's State of Virginia that put Barack Obama over the top to win decisively as President of the United States. History has come full circle. Now to get to work united to solve this economic crisis. God is great and his lessons sometimes take long to learn."
1,Why Sally Hemings: An American Scandal?,"I could never figure out why the work is titles 'Sally Hemings: An American Scandal' How could she be a scandal when no one knew who she was. However, he was a president? It suggests that she, an enslaved mulatto teen age girl, the product of a strange enigmatic, sin filled world controlled by men who knew better could cause a scandal. Why not call it 'Thomas Jefferson: An American Scandal?' I think we clearly know why. It suggests that no matter what Jefferson did, it could be justified in the minds of our society then and today."
3,A Procedural.....,"This book is a procedural on how adopted children may find their birth parents. I read all of these types of books I can find, and the stories are always interesting, as this one was. An interesting story. But the writing itself is so sophomoric I was constantly rolling my eyes at the pendantic sentences and little asides that have nothing whatsoever to do with her search. It was painful to read. But read it I did, and it would appear everyone has a happy ending here. Oh, except for the adopted family who raised and educated her; they are only mentioned as villans who might discover what she was up to. That part is sad and, probably, quite unfair. I wonder if she has told them yet?"
5,"Not a ""toy"" , in my case.","In my case, I've used it as part of a amusement park on my ""O"" guage train layout for the past 5 years. I find it best to use one ""car"" at a time, since they hit into one another at the bottom of the run. Note that the one shown is the ""old"" model (the one I have). I do not like the look of the ""new"" one as much."
4,Beware! Fixed-frequency output,"Although the seller neglects to mention it in the item description, this is a fixed-frequency oscillator (about 1kHz). Don't be misled (as I was) by reviewer ""SO-GLAD""'s comment about adding a multiturn pot to increase the frequency stability--what s/he is referring to is not for frequency selection.So, this product is useless for my purposes, which require variable frequency. However, that is not the fault of the product (only the seller), so I have not reduced my rating because of it. Yes, I could have searched online for more details about the kit, but the item description should have been better.Also, this circuit is based on a relaxation oscillator (555 timer), and not well filtered, so the sine wave output is rather distorted. For that, I drop one star."
5,Excellent generator,This may be a small and low cost device but it exceeded my expectations and performed well beyond the sellers description. Recommended to all technicians as a very handy device to own.
5,Can you wear the pits off a CD?,"I purchased this CD based on a review, having never heard a song by the trio. The day it arrived I popped it into the stereo on the way to work. As the infectious harmonies, yodels and fiddle playing filled the car during ""Wahoo,"" I got a grin *so* big the corners of my mouth damn near met at the back of my neck (which woulda caused the top of my head to slide right off, as everyone knows). I enjoy every song so much that I bought another copy for the office, and I'm going to see the Riders perform live on Dec. 15. I can't recommend them highly enough. Good, clean fun."
3,great at first...,"i've had my set for over a year now, and some pieces are starting to crack. they're supposedly microwave safe, so i'm not sure what's going on."
4,What might have been?,"Not since Anthony Cave Brown wrote ""Bodyguard of Lies"" has there been a really thorough discussion about the role of Wilhelm Canaris in the shadow war against Hitler. Bassett brings a lot of recently-available detail to this book and draws some interesting conclusions. To his credit, he also admits that some aspects of the life of this fascinating character will never be unraveled. The writing style is sometimes a bit choppy but it moves quickly. Had Canaris succeeded in his plans, had Neville Chamberlain been more visionary, had Kim Philby not interfered, the history of World War II would have been very different."
5,Wonderful book,"I only would like a small detail that perhaps Richard Bassett do not know.The other day I was ready the memoirs of Vittorio Mussolini, a book he wrote while in exile in Buenos Aires which was printed in Italy in 1952. Vittorio MUssolini was the elder son's of il Duce.He mention that while in Munich with his father, at the end of 1943, after the liberation of Mussolini by Skorzeny, he asked his father why Germany did not invaded Great Britain in 1940.The answer of his father was that he was discussing the same point with Hitler a few days earlier and Hitler told him that it was due to a mistake made by Canais about the real strengh of the British Army. He gave him a report showing their strenght 3 times higher of what was in reality. Because of that he did cancel the operation Sea Lion, which knowing now the truth was certian he would have suceeded.It seems that not only Spain should built a statue to Canaris, but also Great Britain."
4,Intriguing,We get to know only a little of the private life of Wilhelm Canaris in this book. But I suppose that has to be the case for someone involved in espionage. Canaris' efforts to bring an early end to WWII makes fascinating reading. He was a hero to his conivictions and love of his country at the same time a traitor to the cause he worked for - even though it was as violent and evil as Nazism. The story bogs down considerably in the 1930's when Canaris became involved in events and with people in Spain but picks up speed once the war begins in 1939. Except for an occasional error I found (Cardinal Spellman of New York was not a monsignor during the Second World War and Bulgaria was not occupied by Germans in 1942) I found this an interesting story about a man who came so close to being instrumental in ending the war earlier than it did.
4,Bad first then nice!,They've sent a wrong cable at first shipment. I contacted and told the problem. Got a quick response and they sent the correct item with super fast shipping. Thanks!
4,Just In Time!,Very happy with the product. It was delivered ON Christmas Day and was a very nice surprise for my fiance.
4,Good for the price,"For $25 I did not expect a professional looking Tachikara volleyball. you can see what looks like seams on a few of the panels. I am not concerned with the looks though. I just needed a ball that would withstand ""barn-ball"" players that rent our gym. I think it will do very well. I will update my review in a month or two. and buy more if it holds up."
4,Good value for indoor volleyball,I think this is a pretty good value for an indoor volleyball. It has soft feel and seems to be constructed fairly well. I wouldn't recommend playing with it outside very much. Satisfied with the purchase.
4,review tachikara sv5wm,"Our junior hs program had 8 tachikara golds stolen . We needed replacements and tried the sv5wm which was close to half the price. We were duly impressed. It hit well, did not get that boing sound some of the cheaper balls give, held its' shape and passed very well. We could find no reviews for the ball prior to ordering one and were unsure about what to do. We also had a very limited budget. We called tachikara and talked to someone there. They suggested ordering one especially as a practice ball. We feel very good about the ball. it's not a gold but it is a very good ball at a great price which we use for practice."
3,Mediocre construction,"These balls are highs school sized so they run a little smaller than regulation. The leather material corners on the balls I purchased started to peel up which means the adhesive process used to adhere the leather needs to be changed. The balls are super hard but will break in with time. It would be nice if the manufacturer would pre treat the leather to soften them up. With that said, the balls play very well."
1,"Bad, bad ball.......sending second sample back to amazon now","When I look at all of glowing reviews at amazon regarding this ball I get a distinct felling that either my volleyball was just horribly made in China, instead of, made well in China or Tachikara sold its name to no name company that makes awful volleyballs. I am sending second ball back to amazon for two reason both of them just deflate for no reason at all. Sometime they just deflate sometimes not. And second of all it is very heavy, unforgivably heavy ball for volleyball that doesn't bounce not only from your hand but even from a floor. I am sorry but this is a piece of junk, not volleyball"
2,Not What I expected. Cheaply made.,Glue work is poor. The leather patch is falling apart at day one. I don't know what kind of glue they are using but it's not working. The volley ball is for high school players. This is a High school regulation ball (NFHS). The ball size is a bit smaller than the official size. The leather is hard. Not soft to the touch at all. I do NOT recommend this volleyball for other buyers.
3,ouch,A good durable ball but if you're serious you should spend more for the game ball. This one stings a little.
2,not satisfied the first time,I have purchased lots of items from Amazon. This is the first time I have not been satisfied. I purchased a leather volleyball and when I received it I couldn't believe the quality. It looked like a child pasted it together. I called them right away and they sent me a knew one out right away. The second one was ok but not as good as the ones I see at the gym. I was very dissapointed in the quality of the ball but pleased how they took care of it. I would definately buy from amazon again I just hope the quality control is better.
4,Crackers,"Yummmmm! These crackers are fabulous, especially with a bit of Jarlsberg cheese and a glass of dry white wine! Even more fabulous is the price!"
5,Ka-Me Rice Crunch Crackers,"I discovered these crackers when my husband started a wheat-free diet. We really enjoy these crackers. So many of the other crackers we had tried tasted like cardboard. We were elated when we tried these! They go great with soups, cheese and hummus. Try them - you'll like them."
5,GREAT BIBLE,"I have bought 2 The Life Application Study Bible the NIV and the KJV. Both are GREAT.The application part is better in the NIV for the most part. The KJV is easier to follow in church, because of the format.This Bible will help everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,must have for all interns,"this book hits the spot. it's concise and has all the essential information of a quick browse during rounds or discussions. this helped me a lot during my nephro rotation to calculate acid base status manually (as prescribed by our attending). anything the fellows and attendings were discussing that i didn't understand was right in here. it was also an awful lot of help during cardiology, as this book has an amazing section of arrhythmia and CHF. even if this was a really old edition, it was extremely useful. cons, a little too bulky for most pockets, but it fit in mine."
3,"Over rated in it's usefullness, but it is adequate.","Depending on your level of training, this may not be the manual for you. Having completed Internal Medicine training and becoming board certified, I have to say this is not ""THE"" book of need. It is adequate in its intended purpose for residency training. There are many others that will also be adequate...do your research, look them up."
1,Overrated,"The most overrated book in medicine. Ferri's is much more useful. I bought , rarely used. Not much useful information. Would not recommend to anyone."
2,Terrible!,There are many more useful resources available. This book was of little use for my practice. Keep searching!
5,Great for what it's intended,"The Manual is great as a quick reference for common issues, and it's reasonably portable. It wasn't intended as a comprehensive text of medicine (Harrison's is the best choice for that) nor as a board review (try MKSAP. For its intended use, however, it easily beats out the other ""pocket"" guides."
2,"Over Hyped. Good attempt, but tries too much","I have been through 3 editions of this text, and I continue to be underwhelmed. During my training, i have found this book to be overly brief about the more common pathologies I have seen. Furthermore, the layout is not condusive to a quick search. It has potential, but i am disappointed that it has not achieved more of it, despite the multiple editions."
3,A Bit Narrow,"This shoe runs a bit narrow, which means the tongue is barely covered by the laces. The fabric top also tends to fray where your toes rub against it. When it comes time to replace these shoes, it won't be with this model."
2,"Good starter book, but...","Not a bad book if you want to learn just the basics; however, I think you can easily find everything in this book on the Web if you take the time to dig around. If you're looking for a book to get you started, this one will do nicely. But if you're looking for more advanced/esoteric SVG material, I'd keep looking."
3,Broken,"This was a Christmas present for my niece. She loved the items until we tried to use the disc to teach her how to juggle, it was broken. We tried in numerous players and could not get it to boot up. She was very disappointed. I contacted customer service to send a new disc and I'm still waiting."
4,Juggling,My oldest son requested this item for his birthday so he could show his daughters that he could juggle. The scarves were an added bonus.
3,"nice props, disapointing ""DVD""","I ordered this product primarily because I wanted more scarves for juggling, AND the DVD that comes with it looked good. Unfortunately, the DVD is NOT a DVD, it's a PC compatible CD-ROM. I tried it in my DVD player before I figured that out. That might explain why some reviewers said they had problems with the disk in their DVD players. Once I got that figured out, I was disappointed to find the instructions almost static and very basic. The props themselves though...very nice.My 3 cents (wasn't it worth more then 3?)"
4,"great product, great value","my grandson loves this. he's wanted to learn to juggle and is really excited to start!! would like to see better dvd and step-by-step instructions. nice product, good quality!!"
2,poor performance,"We bought the Tersano Sanitizing unit about a year ago. We buy a lot of fresh vegetables and wanted to be certain that we were getting our veggies clean. The unit hardly ever finishes sanitizing the water, it gets to 98% and then errors out. We thought maybe replacing the cartridge would solve the problem, but it did not. So we are left guessing. Does that mean that 98% of the water in the unit is sanitized? Or it was 98% of the way to being sanitized and then reverted. Is the water killing bacteria? We don't know. On the up-side, the water and the vegetables do smell very nice after sanitization, sort of like how the air smells after a hard rain and thunderstorm. Also, the produce does last longer in the fridge, so i assume it is working a little, but I'm left to guess."
3,"Does fine, hate the price","As far as I can tell, this works just fine in theTersano lotus LBU100 Sanitizing System, which is what I bought it for. I could do without paying this much for it especially after buying the big, expensive system. I will say that the reason it may not be lasting long is due to how often I used the sanitizing system. I use it for cleaning produce, sanitizing items and to make a free household cleanser that works great on killing mold outside the house (no more bleaching!). Other than the expense of replacement filters (this item), I love the system so I guess its a trade-off."
4,Good product,Really fast shipping. Tersano lotus is a really good product I use to clean when in the kitchen. Always good to have back up.
3,disappointed,I ordered this hoping to add a funny Christmas CD to my collection. The titles were humorous. Unfortunately it is impossible to understand the words. The singer is more interesting in maintaining his comic tone than pronouncing the words.
5,Mississippi Quilts by Mary Elizabeth Johnson,Collectors of state quilt books will not want to miss this important addition to their library.
3,Disappointing,"While the book is indeed lovely, a very important element was omitted - quilts by contemporary African Americans. There are a few ""slave"" quilts, but nothing representing the rich culture of African Americans. In my opinion, the book is representative of only half of Mississippi's quilters."
3,Fascinating but Dry,Fascinating for a military history buff but somewhat dry! Mostly narrated in the third person. Filled with details but hard to follow unless you already know which officers commanded which units in both the union and confederate forces. Switches back and forth between unit names and commander's names so that you have trouble following the action. Needs more maps.
2,For hard-core civil war buffs only,"Tsouras does a very thorough job of writing an account of how the battle of Gettysburg could have gone. This is both his greatest asset and his greatest debit. True Civil War buffs (the kind that visit battlefield sites for their vacations, and model them to scale in their basements)will absolutely love all the incredible detail Tsouras packs into this novel (for THEM the book gets a resounding 10, the 3 is for the rest of us). They will lick their lips in anticipation as they recognize a deviation from the ""real"" history and anticipate where it may lead. Everyone else will hate it because you will be completely lost within 10 pages unless you happen to be remember every last regimental and brigade commander involved in the battle. Top it off with Tsouras' writing in the format of a college history text, and you'll soon be bored enough to OFFER to apply the fungus cream to your mother in-law's toenails - just for the excitement."
3,This guy makes Turtledove look good,"I read a lot of alternate history over the course of a year. I have rarely in that time read a book this bad. Let me clarify its not that the book is long, dull and tedious there is also nothing really ""alternate"" about it. There is one case of the good old ""magic bullet"" at the very end but that's about it. This is not unique in most alternate history produced these days it is in fact quite common but most of the others can at least attempt to make the book fun.This author doesn't do that, the book just goes on and on. The author gets his check and the reader is left to wonder how in the world he was ever published.I'm going to read ""For Want of a Nail Again""Overall-Just the worst book I have read in years."
2,A novel about Gettysburg,"I expected something different from this book. I thought the author was going to analyze what might have happened at Gettysburg if the facts were tweaked. For example, if Stuart had come onto the battlefield on day 1 instead of day 3, what might have Lee done differently and what would have been the possible outcomes? This sort of speculation would have been interesting from a writer of talent such as Mr. Tsouras.Instead, what the author has produced is a speculative novel, in which fiction is woven seamlessly in with fact and it is left to the reader to determine which is which. I became impatient with trying to sort out what was fact and what was fiction and gave up. In his quest to confuse the reader, the author has even included fictional footnotes from fictional books.Some who enjoy speculative fiction might like this book. I think I prefer to stick with the facts. Coddington's book on Gettysburg indulges in some speculation that is far more interesting."
1,"Should be labeled ""unbelieveable fiction.""","While ""What if"" questions in history are intriguing, book length treatments of ""alternate histories"" should be classified as fiction, not ""history."" Distrubingly, the author attempts to pass this book off as a ""history,"" to the point of mixing fictional sources in with real sources in his ""footnotes."" Thus a reader with limited knowledge on the battle would have no idea what is ""real"" and what is ""fiction."" Footnotes in this type of book are unnessary and misleading.Just as bad is the fact that the scenario layed out in the book is completely unbelieveable. The strageties of the opposing commanders and subsequent movements of the troops are ludicrous. It would almost be funny, if not for the fact that many readers (who only have a casual interest in Gettysburg) will be fooled into believing this ""history"" was actually possible."
1,Drivel,"I read this book for my senior seminar while studying abroad in Rome. I can safely say that it is the worst book I have ever had to read for a class. Not only are the essays obtuse, but the book is horribly edited and translated. The book suffers from schizophrenia (as I'm sure the conference it was taken from does as well); it is not sure whether it wants to be a philosophy text, a history text, an anthropology text, or something else. These fields of study are all related, but there is no central theme in this book (despite what you might expect from the title). This book attempts to be intellectual, but after reading it you can see that this is just a thin veneer covering an ocean of posturing with no real substance."
4,Nina Simone High Priestess,"Nina Simone is awesome on this live album. My two favorite tracks are 'Westwind' and 'Who Knows Where the Time Goes'. Westwind features outstanding drumming, both songs are soulful and thought provoking."
4,excellent music - fascinating musicians,"I listened to the CD portion of this set first, in the car, and really enjoyed it. Then, as I later had time to watch the DVD, knew that I'd enjoy the CD even more when I could visualize the musicians making it. Kenny Wayne and the video guys obviously had a good time doing it, and their respect for the blues musicians (very few of which I had previously heard of) is obvious. Then, to hear these men (and one woman) talking about making music for 30, 40, 60 years - however long - is fascinating. It kinda makes you catch your breath and say, 'Wow!' The jams you get to see and hear are what getting blues musicians together is all about. Awesome CD / DVD set."
5,10 days out kenny wayne shepherd,"This was one of the best pieces of history I have seen in a very long time. Many of the blues players interviewed will not be with us much longer, and Mr. Shepherd captured true living history. It is not necessary to be into the blues music to appreciate this DVD and CD. It is America at it's finest moments and some embarassing moments."
4,Real,"I so love guitar and blues. This is a ride through the music that created both country and rock. So real, you can smell the moist soil and hear the insects drone, feel the groan of aged floorboards beneath your feet. If you are smart, spend the extra for the DVD and go with KWS and experience this trip."
4,Not quite what the reviews said,"For me, although I like almost every kind of music---I said ALMOST----it all begins and ends with the blues.I loved Kenny Wayne on his first album because it had the grit and passion----real blues leaves you holding your breath.Although this latest is very good, it didn't knock me out. But he did the right thing to get back out there and get in touch with those feelings again.I missed his amazing guitar work on this this CD-----otherwise it was worth the price, and the booklet is an excellent piece of work."
2,KWS,I love blues music and expected this CD to be on the same level as other CDs from KWS. He has done better than this in the past. There was only 3 that I really liked. That does not however mean that you will not like them all. To each his own.
5,Blues Heaven!!!!,I cannot praise this CD/DVD highly enough and if you are a fan of The Blues this is a must buy.Kenny plays with a lot of the all time greats in intimate settings and the whole experience is what blues music is all about.Unlike some modern day so called bluesmen who have sold out and now produce more mainstream music Kenny has stayed loyal to his roots which is captured wonderfully here for all to see.
5,A slam dunk for blues album of the year,I spent 35 years in radio and television and very little impresses me but there is always the exception. 10 Days Out in my opinion is one of the best blues albums in a decade. This is a project that not only cried out tbe done but was expertly done. The dvd will keep you glued to your tv. Watch it first then listen to the cd. This baby is a labor of love and it shows. One can only hope that Warner Brothers realizes what they have and cranks up the promotion.
5,Incredible,"Worthwhile(esp for Blues fans) CD and DVD - the music is fantasic but the DVD is incredible, worth twice the price of admission! The DVD is a must watch even if you're not a fan of Blues music."
3,10 Days Out (Blues from the Backroads) ( cd/dvd),"On a scale of 1-10 I rate this a 7, It was not exactly what I thought it would be. The concept of honoring the ""gray beards"" of Blues was on the money but I wanted more uptempo from Kenny. Only a few cuts really highlited his guitar work."
5,Great Classics!!!!,"If you are a fan of the blues you will love this album!!! But don't take my word for it, play a preview and you will be hooked. I have always enjoyed the blues and will listen to it on pandora or something like that, I have not purchased a ton of albums because I like to have a mix, and that is what this album gave me.I loved all the tracks!! And the differences in the singers, so this is a great sample for me. My uncle who is a die hard blues fan loves it too, so I think this will appeal to all blues fans new or old :).I can not even pick a favorite track because they are all so unique, although Grindin Man with Pinetop Perkins is way up there, but then so is Born in Louisiana with Clarence Brown, and Prison Blues - really just can not pick 1 favorite :).Some people get into all the nuances of songs and such, I just know what I like, and I LOVE this album."
5,La Blues Lover,This was well worth the wait and hype. My husband and I love it. Glad to see that the blues aren't dead.
5,Amazing!,"This is a must buy for anyone who is even moderately interested in the blues, KWS, or even American musical history! The music is outstanding, but the DVD is really what makes this special. It is consists of interviews with the musicians where they talk about their life, and also some jamming of course! I suggest watching the DVD while you are connected to your sound system (or good headphones)... sit back and enjoy! I hope this wins some awards."
5,Once in a lifetime opportunity.,"We owe Kenny and family/friends a special thanks for doing this. BUY-IT, it's a treasure to own in every way. Fantastic view into the lives & great music of the REAL Bluesman we have left."
5,10 Days Out Blues From The Back Roads,"This was a gift for my boyfriend, who had taken me to a Kenny Wayne Sheppard concert. He was thrilled with the DVD and felt every Blues fan should have it in their collection."
5,Wonderful Singing,"Fantastic traditional unaccompanied singing from Johnny McDonagh, Colm Keane and Sean Jeaic McDonagh. Johnny McDonagh's version of ""Morrissey and the Russian Sailor"" is the finest ""come all ye"" I have ever heard recorded and Colm Keane singing ""Soldier, Soldier"" is amazing."
2,No clear coat..,Image scratches off easily. I placed it on the back of a white iphone and from the rubbing in my pocket it was destroyed. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it is Patriots
3,NOT A CLING DECAL,"Be Warned! This is definitely not a static cling decal. It is a sticker. Having said that, the decal looks great and I have no other issues with it since it was inexpensive."
3,IT WAS SOOO OLDDDD,It was alright...the junk is old making it really boring. The host just completely blew the darn thing. I like the blood and guts but some of the footage was really not shown like that bear eating that man and that alligator thingy..they did not show it completely
1,Sad.,"I sure hope that there is someone rolling tape when I die a horrid death, that way millions of people can be entertained by watching the life slip from my body."
3,.,This DVD is good for someone who has never exercised in their life. It has some very good tips but again for someone who has never exercised.If you have been to physical therapy even once then you have covered all that is in this DVD. I was disappointed that there wasn't more information for the price. They have a nice explanation of the exercises.
1,VBEX,This seller is cheater only. Do not place an order for this book. I placed an order on Dec 23' 2009 and not received book till date Jan 24' 2010. Though Amazon.com promised me to return the money back but I have not received it back.
2,We wait for a decent Vinyl-CD transfer !!,"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer Jack Casual, it's just a pity I bought the Monster-CD before I read his review! I owned this Steppenwolf album before on cassette and it sounded great. But this CD is really badly remixed! In particular the v o i c e s are hardly hearable on many occasions. For a decent recording I would easily give 5 stars. Who ever produced this CD, please try again (or let somebody else do the job) and then send all disappointed customers a free copy !!! (By the way, the same problem happened for Uriah Heep's ""Look at yourself"", arguably there best album, but terribly remixed.)"
5,Get it NOW!,"Boy does this CD ring true over 30 years after its initial release. I was given the album as a present back when it first came out and POW - right between the ears and eyes! What a sound. And then listening to Monster/Suicide/America - holy crap! And now, over 30 years later - the song still is fresh - even more so considering what has transpired over the last 7+ years in this country. Political? You bet your butt it is. But it doesn't mean that it isn't true or relevant.If you haven't heard of Steppenwolf before - here you go - jump in with both feet. If you have been a fan and don't have this in your collection - get it now."
5,Steppenwolf Addresses The Issues of the Day,"Steppenwolf is a band that could always be considered the news network of music. Any political issues that were making waves, Steppenwolf covered it. ""Monster"" was the controverial album in which John Kay targeted the issues that were at a head in 1969, and made a big impact on his followers. It's arguable that it was John Kay's fearless attitude that paved the way for the punk and heavy metal movement. Depending on which side of the fence you're one will determine how you will appreciate ""Monster""."
5,Crank Brother,"Excellent!!!! as soon as reveived the product I used it, this is very good, I recommend it so much, This is the first time that i purchase a cranckbrother product."
1,the format in this book is awful,"the format of this book is black and white comic book style . if u are over 20 and wear glasses,might as well trash it, that is where my brand new copy is going.i would not have purchased, if informed it was a comic book. total bummer..."
2,Not as good as the other books in the series,"I thoroughly enjoyed the other books I've read in this series, especially The Big Book Of Death, which have always proven to be fun and interesting. This book has the same problem that nearly all books about the paranormal have, which is a total lack of any rigor or skepticism. Every goofy paranormal claim is treated seriously, no matter how many times it's been debunked. I know this book isn't exactly a serious discussion of the subject matter, but it would be nice to see a little more fostering of healthy skepticism and a little less passionate embrace of phony mystery."
2,Poor attempt to deal with the strange and unknown,"As in other books in this series, the use of different artists causes the quality to vary to extremes. This book has the added weakness of erroneous and discredited info being bounced around when dealing with some of these phenomena. Good as a light read and perhaps a few laughs."
2,Photos...,I bought this book after seeing the Nicole Kidman movie that was made about her life. The movie was so weird I had to see what her photos looked like. They are also weird...
1,Diane going over the edge,"That Diane Arbus is a serious and important artist, there is no doubt. But even the greatest of artists can be wrong.This is not a book that most people would wish to have on their coffee table, or anywhere in their homes. The images are grotesque, disturbing, cruel, ugly.These images were made when Arbus's life was spiraling down, when she was more and more lost in her final depression. They provide an insight into her mind that it would have been better not to publish."
1,"Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs, Fifteenth Edition:The International Encyclopedia of Adverse Drug Reactions and Interactions 6 Vo","Es un producto del cual no he podido comprar ya que me indican que hay en existencia usados pero despues de ha er la compra me dicen a los dias que no hay y como mi presupuesto es reducido espero que haya usados para poder hacer la compra, encontre precios de 181 a 203 dollares, pero no se hizo la compra por la razòn expuesta."
5,Great book for Phonics & Spelling Gr.3-5,This is a great how-to book for one specific phonics & spelling teaching strategy. It has made a big difference in my third graders ability to sound out unknown words and incorporate their knowledge of spelling patterns. Making Words is geared for K-3rd. Making Big Words is for 3rd thru 5th graders. It's a hands-on approach and it is very adaptable. You can do it just as suggested or adjust it to your students' particular need. It includes hundreds of lessons. It can also be used in coordination with thematic units that you may be using in your room. A great resource. Worth every penny. I just love Patricia Cunningham!
4,ESL Teacher,I use this book regulary with my second languge students. They enjoy moving around the letters to make words and their spelling has gotten much better.
2,According to the Author,"The stated goal of this book is to introduce readers to the world of English women in the Tudor and Stuart periods, using the written words of men at that time. Hull makes the point that most books were written by men, and few enough women could read. That means the sources she has focussed on - 'lifestyle guides' as we might call them now, dealing with issues such as health, rules for wives and daughters, sex, child care, and cooking - are of limited help in telling us what women's lives were really like. At times the book reads like a study in misogyny, with women being derided, scolded, and lectured by the male authors of the period. While the extracts make interesting reading, I found the author's voice intrusive, as she makes anachronistic comments about the advice given in the books. Overall I would have preferred more direct extracts and less comment. However it is a useful collection of sources for the period."
2,"This cd will put a smile on your face, maybe.....","I am gald to say that i have all the solo piano cds by Sally. What a remarkable talent Sally possess. Wow! The $64,000 question is how to get Sally to always hit on all cylinders. It seems that Sally is very unpredicatable. On this cd Sally played 4 songs that were dynamite, then seemed to run out of steam. What a shame it is to not have more dymanic songs by Sally.I can say that i have never bought a cd by Sally that had not songs that i didn't like.It seems Sallys' focus is on the fairly new songs. Sally rarely records many of the old standards. This is the kind of music that i like to listen to. Maybe Sally could finally bring her self to recording a cd of nothing but old standards. I'm waitng!I Can Barely Recommend This Cd"
2,Good Story ANNOYINGLY Told,"I was interested in this as a Bargain Book because it takes place in North Dakota, and because the book's author is a teacher at Moorhead State. I almost couldn't finish the book because of the haphazard narrative style; the tenses shift from past to present without warning -- or without reason, and that habit the author has of interjecting dialogue without cues is absolutely maddening. I have never seen anything like that before: Jake blah blah blah and ""Suddenly says something."" That particular device was so irritating I almost couldn't focus on the plot.It was a good story but I really wish it had been told in a more straightforward manner."
2,Was Not What I Expected,"My lack of interest in this book stems from the fact that nothing really happens. The character of Luella is a nagging witch who constantly gets pissed at Jake because he doesn't act or respond to her the way she would like him to. Ten years after losing his wife, Jake is a quiet, reserved man still in mourning, and Luella is always screaming at him to let go of the past (not exactly an endearing character you want to relate to). I reluctantly finished the book just to see how it would end. Maybe some people can dig enough to find a deeper meaning to this book, but to me it is just what it seems on the surface--a novel about insurance fraud."
2,Pedantic and ponderous,"I had such high hopes for this book and its subject matter. Unfortunately, when you combine an authoritarian certainty with a lack of imagination (if not rigor), the results are very disappointing. Phenomenology this is not, although the title entices. Fairly early on, when the author excludes the sensory reality of synesthesia by stating dogmatically that the physical senses are isolated and discrete, I'd had about enough. Like some other religious ""thinkers"" I have encountered (and studied under, to my regret), Gaffney cannot avoid the Luciferian temptation to flog his readers with unquestioned pet ideas that I trust would make his hero Aquinas redden with embarassment. Skip this one."
2,RATE/REVIEW,The item is pictured with the center piece -- It did NOT come with this item and I was unable to find the appropriate piece to fit the inside so the item was un-useable. Not to mention one of the items was broken upon receipt
5,"This world IS god, purposely self-immersed in life & death.","""The Game of God"" makes a radical postulation that the world, or the universe, is a direct and singular manifestation of a perfect, eternal spirit which has consciously decided to forget its own transcendent nature and immerse itself in duality and limitation. THIS is what all the dramas and joys of life are all about."
3,I expected more.,"With all the glowing reviews, I was expecting something more in depth.In a nutshell:A) Every one on Earth is an ego-maniac unless/until they transcend their ""survival as form"" (ego) to God/a higher power.Basically the same principal as AA, which the book credits for it's use of the 12 steps to transcendence.B) God created the universe to understand limitation. Really? God needed, in essence, a petri dish 78 billion light-years wide to understand limitation? He/She/It could have saved a few billion years of evolution and just created a Mother-in-law.:-) (sorry...)I liked the format of the book, it was humorous in parts and well written, I just feel the concept wasn't as ""Earth shattering"" as it was made out to be."
4,It's a journey for the writer and the reader,"When I first picked up this book, I was entranced by his descriptive writing. It was not the type of book that I consumed all at once. It took time to get through it because his travel descriptions got very dense as well as his inner experience during the journey. I learned about Buddhism and the B'on religion that predates it. Anyone who has an interest in Buddhism or Nepal and Tibet would enjoy this book. Keep in mind that it's not a light read."
4,True Beauty,"In one word, this book is beautiful. From the first page, it is clear the Matthiessen is a talented writer. Each sentence is poetic, its words bringing to life this journey. While the writing is enjoyable, the content makes this book incredible. Matthiessen brings to life the beauty of Nepal, with its vast mountain ranges as well as the animals that inhabit the country. This book of exploration and nature has a philisophical side in which Matthiessen experiences Nepal in a spiritual way. This too is describe in a beautriful writing style. This book is a joy to read."
2,Reviewed by Shelton1,"The SNOW LEOPARD - Interesting descriptions of Tibet back country and customs but author constantly contradicts himself, he seems disoriented like he might have done too many drugs in his life, imagine that, he is a self admitted psychedelic user and he writes like it. Matthiessen demeans his Sherpas while intimating some sense of loss at leaving his 8-year-old son at home one year after his wife died while he treks around Tibet for two months, inexcusable!"
2,Could get past all the Zen talk,"Tried to read this book after many people's high reviews, but I could not get past all his talk of Zen and Buddhism. I kept getting confused by all the religious talk when all I wanted to know about was the physical journey."
5,zen and the art of chasing wild cats,"Simply one of the best books I've ever read. Matthiessen manages to capture the length and breadth of his journey in every sense of those words. A book this helpful on the spiritual aspects of the journey would be excellent; a book this fascinating about a trek like his would be great; put 'em together and you win a national book award. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to think, learn, and grow. If you want simple entertainment enter John Grisham in the search box."
2,"Needs more reality, less zen","This book is 1/3 hiking, 1/3 animals, and 1/3 extentialism that bogs it down with boredom. The intro is so boring you cannot help but wonder when it will end. And the first 60-80 pages are a snoozer about religion and drug use. It gets better during the trek, and the animal sightings.I found it odd that he ended the book without talking about getting home and seeing his kids...but then again, how much could he care about them if he was willing to go on an expedition 2 mo's after his wife dies...leaving his kids to deal with their mothers death without him."
3,Just a warning,I ordered this saw thinking it is made in the USA. I should have researched more. It is made in China. For $23 I could have bought a similar saw locally. I undid the tightening adjuster all the way (accidentally) and noticed metal shavings inside. An indication to me of inferior metal. I would have returned it but it would have costs me $6. Sad that it is so difficult to find tools made in the USA.
4,excellnt,"Last Puff turned out not to be the last of Spooky Tooth, as they reformed within a few years after making this.But if it had been, this would not have been a bad way to go. After makingSpooky Two, the band made the avant gaurdCeremonywith French electronics composer Peirre Henry (On-ree'. Don't sound like the idiot I sounded like before I was corrected)Last Puff returns to the bluesy hard rock of Two, but here, the sound is fuller and more elaborate. Thicker keybords and more emphasis on female backup vocals make this sound somewhat like Joe Cockers work of the period--a lot of the same players were used. This, though, has a hard rock edge.Very satisfing rock and heavy R&B.; ""Wrong Time"" and the cover of ""I Am The Walrus"" stand out."
4,2nd best album by spooky tooth,"only the tremendous spooky two album tops this one. their version of david ackles' down river is great as is the i am the walrus cover and their version of elton john's son of your father. spooky tooth were great with other people's material. mike harrison was surely one of the finest british vocalists of this or any period.this is a fine album worth picking up , not quite a classic( there's a pair of mediocre cuts on this ) but above average."
3,"Good, but limited","I like this book as there is almost no PC from the early years that escape it. But my biggest issue is I would like to see more background on more PCs, not just a brief list of specs. Very few have any history of any detail and they're the well-knowns, like Commodore and Tandy. Bigger, color photos would be a real plus as well."
4,Collectible Microcomputers,"If you are a collector of old microcomputers like myself then this book is a must. It's an affordable reference guide that you'll always be referring to. Personally I'd love to see a colour edition of this book, a more international (rather than US) flavour and I'd like to see the entries per manufacturer in chronological order rather that alphabetical order."
1,dreadful,"Buying this video is a waste of money. After seeing it once I have placed it on a high shelf. Basically the author tells us how aikido changed her life and transformed her from a shy introverted person to one brimming with self confidence. Good for her but no reason to have people pay money to find that out.The half of the tape where she demonstrates techniques is lacklustre. For the novice, the expert, or the historian this is not the video for you; or as they say in aikido jargon TESABAKI get out of the way!"
4,A Gem!!!,"I received this book as a birthday gift and not knowing the author was not expecting much. Oh, what a lovely birthday surprise to find out it is a gem of book. The story could have been deary and depressing given the subject matter of a berating mother, low-self esteem, bad marriage, etc, but Kabak covers it with tenderness and delightful humor. I liked the prose, the British wit,the character structure, and the resolution.Good first effort, Ms. Kabak!!!!"
5,Can't put it down!!!!!!!!!!!,"For anyone who has ever had problems with an overbaring mother, or guy problems. From an unplanned pregnacy, calling off a wedding, and finally getting married this book will keep you reading. You will not be able to put it down! I promise! The story hits so many aspects of a normal person's life. Enjoy!"
2,"If you love the Duke, you'll hate this","The Duke is rolling over in his grave. There was nothing of his style on this CD. There are lots of flutes in Jingle Bells and Sleigh Ride. Liner notes are almost non-existent -- you have no idea who the vocalists or musicians are, or when the track was recorded. Silver Bells is really awful, especially the person who is singing the little bit of echo completely flat. Ouch. Auld Lang Syne is played Dixieland style, which is somewhat odd for an Ellington recording. It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas sounds like a Lawrence Welk recording. :o(As a straight big band CD it might pass, but don't expect much more than that."
3,It is not the Best,"Unlike the other reviewer, I did not ""hate this,"" even though I am an ardent Duke Ellington appreciator. There are a few nice arrangements and performances, but the drawbacks are these:1. The shortness of playing time2. No band members are identified on the CD, besides Duke himself3. The vocalist (whom I cannot identify and who was not one of Ellington's better ones) is poor, sounding more like soul than real jazz singing.However, the sound is clear and rich, unlike many of Ellington's older works, and there is a non-Christmas piece, ""Take the A-Train,"" which is well done, especially Duke's piano introduction.There are literally a hundred Ellington recordings I recommend before this one, but...it is still Duke Ellington and his world-famous orchestra."
1,Mulching with Hot Manure and Hay,This is an autobiographical reflection on life including vegetable and flower gardening for 20-30 years preceding its publication in 1955. It is not contemporary. It is not a how to manual. Except to gradually build a giant mulch pile which is the garden. I already knew that. So it was a poor value for my money.
1,poor quality control; even poorer customer service,"i received this item to use for tailgating at football games. two of the telescoping sections were jammed when i received it, so you could not raise the pole beyond one section. after several back and forths with customer service, the company sent a 'replacement' section - but only sent one portion so the pole was still inoperative. again i called customer service and this time they charged me shipping and handling for the additional section of pole. all this for an item i have never used yet!"
5,Enjoyable read,"I did not expect that the bestseller from 18 century could be so good. I also saw Italian series ""Elisa di Rivombrosa"" and ""La Figlia di Elisa"" that was based on this book."
3,Pamela - dumb like a fox.,"If you enjoy epistolary books this is quite enjoyable with less maddening characters than in Clarissa. I would suggest reading this prior to Clarissa.As always, Richardson brings out the worst in people and makes each fault larger than life. Do not use this as a what I want to be when I grow up primer."
3,"It's a Classic, What Can You Do?","I tried to avoid reading Pamela, but after reading Joseph Andrews & Tom Jones by Henry Fielding (not to mention slowly through most of Tristram Shandy) I felt compelled to read Pamela. It truly was a sensation in its day, and reading this edition- with the original text restored- it's easy to see why. Like other 18th century classics, it's far more ribald then many later english novels and the tense sexual politics ultimately outweighs the at-times tedious verbiage."
4,Rewarding,"Pamela was a required book in a college class I took a few years ago - and as such 'forced reading'. Therfore, I had an opinion similar to the harsh reviews below. However, during a bizarre fit of eighteenth century reading, I tried it again. With time to read and actually absorb the words, I thoroughly enjoyed it! Pamela is a very humourous look at two ""country bumpkins"" (as the editor puts it). Pamela herself is not a very sympathetic character. However, her dramatizing of the events taking place around her is wonderfully funny! Don't come to this novel expecting to find a story of an innocent maid in danger - she's just not there. What you will find is a conceited, uppity girl about to enter a relationship with a similarly vain man on the lowest rung of the then gentry. Certainly the work gets a little trying in places, but give it a chance - it really is well worth it."
1,the anti-feminist book of the old millenium...,"despite certain theorists views that this is actually a story of feminist or working class triumph, i found this piece of writing to be painfully misogynistic and classist. pamela is a young female housemaid whose master attempts to rape her several times, going to such lengths as kidnapping her, lying to her and anyone who'll listen and attempting to bribe her. pamela's resistance earns her a marriage to the same would-be rapist, after which everything comes up roses for pamela. this novel is extremely repetitive. part ii could easily have been condensed to ten pages or so without losing much. apparently pamela is the perfect christian, wife, daughter, servant, mistress, etc, etc. she's beautiful, too, with a waist that her master's hands can span. she annoyed the bejesus out of me. so did the novel. ..."
1,Hard to stomach,"I normally love all of the classics and have read dozens, but I just could not finish this book. I started reading it because Henry Fielding (a great author, one of the most entertaining books I've ever read is his ""Tom Jones"") wrote a parody of it called ""Shamela"" so I thought I should read the original before I read the parody; before I was 50 pages in I understood why Fielding wrote his book. The heroine is completely unbelievable and almost nauseatingly saintly, the ""villian"" has an unrealistic turnaround, and there is absolutely no plot to speak of. 70 pages can go by without a single interesting event happening. As Samuel Johnson said ""If you were to read Richardson for the story your impatience would be so much fretted you would hang yourself."""
5,Easy to use - creates great reports,"I am very confused by all negative reviews of this product. I think this product is wonderful! With the click of your mouse, you can create beautiful color reports & charts and store them in .pdf format. I emailed them out as Christmas gifts to my relatives and they were thrilled! I was amazed at how easy it was to create professional looking reports with FTM.I should mention I originally purchased The Master Genealogist program because the customer reviews were better than Family Tree Maker - but found it to be very difficult to work with. After 3 months using TMG, I still couldn't figure out how to make a decent report. Within 1 day of using the FTM, I had created a beautiful family tree book.I think the FTM is perfect for the amateur genealogist looking to quickly and easily create family charts, trees & reports.Also, I found entering data to be so much easier in FTM than TMG. I have been just thrilled with the product."
3,Why So Expensive From Amazon,Buying direct from 'www.familytreemaker.com' costs $29.99. Amazon charges $42 for the same package... Why the increase..
2,FAMILY TREE MAKER 11 PROGRAM ERROR,"Family Tree Maker 11 has a program error which has not been corrected. It cannot correctly transfer information for a tree chart to PDF. The charts are incomplete and not centered on the page. The problem was detected last October 2003, acknowledged by technical support and I was told : ""Thank you for your reply. I am still waiting to hear back from the individual checking into this for me. I will let you know when I have more informaiton."" That was October 21, 2003 and I am still waiting for a reply. I would NOT recommend purchasing version 11 until this is corrected. Version 10 works beautifully and the added features of version 11 are in no way worth loosing the ability to print charts."
1,"Poor, deceitful Customer Support","My experience with the company that produces this Family Tree Maker software and may other CDs that they pedal is very bad. They will double bill you and they lie and say they refunded you, and then lie and say they show no record that you even ordered. While FTM genealogy program is OK (there are others in the market which are better), it is unfortunate company policy that they design it to where you have to keep buying more add-ons. Other genalogy software companies are honest, but not this one. The census CDs I foolishly boutght are worse than worthless. I do NOT recommend purchasing anything from this company. Buy from a company with integrity."
1,Useless program,After having spent all the money on the program you should NOT have to buy all the bloody add ons to make it even semi useful
4,THIS IS ONE FREAKY MOVIE !!,"This is truely a freaky movie. Not really scary but put together very well. The cast is pretty good also. Good movie to watch if you dont want to be scared, but still like to be freaked out a little."
1,DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER,"The item received absolutely DOES NOT look like the item ordered; furthermore, when I contacted the seller they were bold enough to:1. Say that I was confused2. They said that they do not offer photos for every product they carry!!???Please read their response below:section from one letter--""Unfortunately we do not offer photos for every product we carry and that is why the typed product description is right next to the photo and again in the shopping cart to allow the consumer the opportunit to review their order before they finalize it."" ????They did say that they will refund me."
1,out of stock,I was e-mailed a few days after placing the order and informed that it is out of stock. The site still lists it as in stock...don't believe them.
3,Tresor Eau de Parfum .25 oz,"The product arrived in good as advertised condition. However, I have since come to learn that it was a tad pricey, especially as it is unboxed. No major complaint."
2,"Not bad taste, but horrible smell",I had to stop eating this meal because it smelled so bad. I am not one to turn down food either.

3,Buy it for the armband only.,"The armband is made of stretchy elastic and goes through the belt loop in the back of the ""case"". The ""case"" is gelled plastic that leaves the buttons and the screen fully exposed. This means that any other object rubbing against these areas will scratch and dent them. The plastic may protect against dropping but that is about it.The belt clip is exactly the same as any cell phone belt clip; it is a plastic U with metal U inside.Aside from the band itself I feel that the product seems cheaply constructed."
2,Not worth it,For two weeks I thought this product was fine. It did not look exactly as pictured yet was enough for me. I only needed something to carry my player to the gym and back. Just yesterday though the case ripped. The case is made out of some soft plastic(maybe silicone). The problem lies with the design of the case. The holes that the armband pass though are large and travel laterally up the back of the case. These holes expose some of the case to thin and thus weak points. These weak points handle all the stress and force when the player is tugged or shifted on you arm. Well the thin areas spilt and caused a catastrophic failure of the case. So like I said poor design. In my opinion try another brand or company or try a universal one.
1,Garbage,Garbage. Silicone case broke after running for about 1.5 hours. The arm band D ring slides around and binds the straps. It maybe good if you only wear it on your belt - but don't bet on it. The case didn't fit my zen micro very well. It was loose fitting and I shoulda guessed it then. DO not buy if you value your mp3 player.
3,Tedious sailing story,"Sometimes amusing, often dull story of a sailing journey. There are many others much better written out there (in my opinion). The sailing tips would be much better accompanied by pictures or drawings (there are a few), to understand what Jim is trying to say."
4,Not sure what to think.....,"This is a well written book but is difficult to digest. I can see where people come off calling London a racist, this book is full of those tones but in context they fit the story line and one can see that London was writing from the perspective of the time and the stage he was trying to set. Very different than other London books I've read, canabalism, dog language, and an obscure setting in the Solomon Islands. However, very imaginative and vivid in it's character descriptions as always. Worth reading, especially if you like dogs....."
3,This isn't Traffic.,"This is a reasonably well produced album, recorded with some legendary Muscle Shoals musicians but yet it still fails to impress. The material could have been stronger as there really isn't an exceptional song in the bunch. Capaldi is competent but isn't quite strong enough to carry a band by himself. He was at his best assuming the occassional lead vocal with Traffic. Where he attempts to come across as a blue eyed soul/blues man his abilities are really better suited for the medium of rock. Where the musicians are solid enough the material would have benefited from a little stretching out and a few passionate solos. The soloing is good but not inspiring. Overall the disc is o.k., just not essential. Stick with Traffic you'll be better off...Simon"
2,In the midst of lesser stuff...,"Capaldi albums seemingly tend to have one outstanding song in the midst of much lesser material. Actually, WHALE MEAT AGAIN has two. After opening with the wonderfully catchy, memorable ""It's All Right"", it mostly goes nowhere until hitting the best song, ""My Brother"". Besides that, ""Yellow Sun"" is a fairly decent, laid-back number, but it's sabotaged by weak, first-draft lyrics (anyone who ends two ""rhyming"" lines with the same word really needs to try harder). ""Summer Is Fading"" blows its potential by staying stuck in a 2-chord progression (for 8.5 minutes). Other tracks range from forgettable to unlistenable."
5,White Indian Series,"So far I have read books 1 through 19 and have found them to be very entertaining and enjoyable I recommend the ""White Indian Series"" of books by Donald Clayton Porter to anyone who enjoys western dramas of epic proportions"
2,could be better!,"As a German native, I bought this Dvd for my class, this is my 3rd German DvD and again not a good one!The sound effect is so bad, you can't hear the person talking but the backnoise is super loud!Also the top sights in cities are swans, my class got good laugh out of it.I've been to almost all cities in this DvD and there is more than 3 seconds of city and 5minutes of swans. Really bad- I wish I could get my money back!I only give 2 stars, since is shows more than only munich, octoberfest and the hofbrauhaus!"
5,the best accounting of the human condition available now,"This is more than a book. It is a study. I have been studying it for almost 15 years. Well worth the time and effort.Get out your dictionary. Msrs G and Longchenpa are very exact. They say more in a paragraph than most ""experts"" on the human mind and livingness say in a lifetime.Mr G and L deserve highest praise.Michael Mourer"
3,"excellent features and range, but other issues","other reviewers have covered the good feature set of this unit. it's a good small business model. I was most impressed with it's inclusion of 4 separate SSIDs with selective isolation and security.it has a great range. was able to cover an entire 7500 sq ft. machining facility with plenty of mechanical noise with just one unit in the middle.cons: for me, the first unit I got would only transmit for 20 minutes before isolating itself from the gateway and the rest of the network. it eventually devolved into not responding at all. however, Amazon returns dept. took great care of me and the replacement seems to be working fine."
2,Frustrating,"I puchased this as a bridge for my LG BluRay player for streaming Netflix movies. Set up was not overly difficult, but after getting it configured, it would never work. I was on the phone with Cisco Customer service four different times for over an hour each time. All of the fixes they attempted would not make it work. I am sure there is a small simple step we are all missing. I can not recommend purchasing this item, at least as a bridge. I may reconfigure it as a P.O.E."
1,big disappointment,"I was so impressed by the rave reviews that I couldn't wait to buy this book. It was one of my biggest disappointments! The ""recipe"" for broiled veal chops is salt and pepper the veal and broil it. Likewise, the recipes for broiled pork chops and broiled steak are salt and pepper and broil. That's a recipe? The book is very heavy on veal and uses can after can of San Marzano Italian plum tomatoes which might be readily available in big cities but not in my world. Frankly - there was nothing here that seemed unusual or special. Save your money to actually fly to NYC to visit the restaurant. Aapparently being ""exclusive"" makes up for simplisitic non-recipe recipes."
2,Someone left some ingredients out!!!!,"Borrowed the book and made some of the recipes...(meatballs, marinara sauce, lemon chicken) I couldn't understand why such a famous restaurant would release their secret recipes to the public....(hint:they didn't)"
5,Rao's Cookbook,"I had been wanting this cookbook for a very long time, but it was quite expensive to buy brand new in the bookstore. I found it on Amazon and it was half the price! I ordered it, it arrived quickly, and I'm quite pleased with it. The recipes are amazing and very easy to follow. Visually, it is a beautiful cookbook, great photos and I loved reading about the history of Rao's. The introduction was great!"
5,Great cookbook! These recipes are easy and delicious!,"I am a big cookbook fan, and this is probably one of the best I have ever read. The recipes are delicious, simple to follow and none of the ingredients are hard to find. I especially enjoyed the glimpse into the the history of the restaurant's surrounding neighborhood."
5,A must have,Great cookbook. I use it regularly. Meatballs are my favorite. My niece loves the tomato with red onion salad. Chicken is great. Just a wonderful book to have.
4,Finally! Practical & Delicious Italian Cuisine,"About time...All too often the recipes from the cookbooks of great restaurants are convoluted and, quite simply, wrong. These recipes are simple, straight forward and delicious.The only thing missing are more pictures of the dishes. With that, it's a five-star."
3,Not so good,"I recently ate at Rao's in Eat Harlem and the food was excellent so I decided to buy this book and give the recipes a shot, well the first recipe I made was the Sunday gravy and it did not come out as expected. The gravy was more like soup and no matter how long I cooked it it would not thicken up. I will continue to try recipes from this book and update this post with my findings. Only reason for the 3 stars is because I am giving it the benefit of the doubt being I ate there and I loved it."
3,Too much olive oil!,"The recipes are OK, but in my opinion, 1 cup of olive oil per recipe is too much, even if you are using the best of oils, in which case it seems to me you would use less, not more oil. I have tried several recipes and found that most of them would have been better had I cut back on all of that oil -- everything tasted like it was swimming in grease. If that's real home Italian cooking, then they must like it greasy. This book was kind of a disappointment after all the hype. Also, these are not dishes you are going to make after working all day. These require planning, preparation, distinct ingredients, like special tomators, and time to put it all together."
5,Delicious beyond words!!,"I first heard about this book while watching Sarah Moulton on the Food Channel. She had Frank Pellegrino and his son as guests, and they were impressive to watch. The simplicity of the recipes appealed to me, so I ordered the book from Amazon.com. What a treat!! So far,I have made the meatballs, the braciole and the Sunday Gravy, as well as the shrimp scampi. Every dish was superb. I followed the authors' advice and ordered a case of San Marzano tomatoes from The Salumeria in Boston, MA, and was very pleased with those as well. Finally, I am able to cook Italian dishes that taste truly Italian, every bit as flavorful and satisfying as the food I have eaten in Boston's North End. This is a definite winner--I can't praise it highly enough."
1,someone didn't want to tell the family secrets,"We looked foward to cooking from this book. However, we've been very disappointed...something is missing...mainly ingredients...otherwise this is the blandest food ever. tried sunday gravy... 3 cans of tomatoes and 2 cans of water with 3tablespoons of tomato paste...no spices...just roasting meats...tasted like tomato soup!"
4,Liked it! Very helpful during pregnancy.,"I had a lot of lower back pain while pregnant, and started taking pilates classes. The instructor also recommended that I buy this DVD and said that it was the best pilates DVD out there since it follows guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.While it does start a little slow, it has very good exercises and a routine. It really helped my back and I'm so thankful I did it during pregnancy so that once baby was born, I didn't have back issues to then deal with!"
2,Boring,"I found the tape quite boring. It is too expensive for the benefit you get. The exercises are too difficult, no music, I was disappointed for the money I paid it was not what I was looking for, no positive energy, the tempo is too slow."
2,Not what I expected.,"I order two of these bokkens because I saw it has pretty high review.I received two of different weight and density. After playing 5 minutes with my 7 year old son,the lighter one got all dented. I have to say that my 7 year old son doesn't hit that hard.In addition, one of the rubber to hold the hand guard came missing. I agree with one of the other comment that the blade is rather thick."
3,Boken,"This product is cheap enough but could have been made a little better. I use it frequently, but is not my first choice."
2,Low quality,I purchased these swords for my son who is 12. They looked very sturdy and well made. We only struck them together about several times before one broke. We weren't striking them together hard for fear of rapping are knuckles. We considered returning the sword but the shipping wasn't worth taking another chance on a problem.
2,Good for 1/10 speed...,"With all things considered, i cannot see this boken being made out of descent wood. Within 5 minutes of sparring(3/10 speed), the boken was already splintering, badly. There are also many manufacturing flaws, cracks in the finish as well as the base materiel. Lastly the guard is pretty shoddy. The vibrations made from contact caused the cheaply made plastic to snap in half."
3,Tate Gallery's description (includes no.s of ill.s),"""Joshua Reynolds: The Creation of Celebrity features many of Reynolds's most famous and beautiful portraits. Individual sections consider the friendships Reynolds cultivated with the famous and infamous figures of his time: politicians; courtesans; literary figures; war heroes; and aristocrats. These flamboyant and influential subjects helped to promote and sustain Reynolds's distinguished career and, ultimately, to secure his enduring popularity with audiences today.""296pp, 110 colour and 20 black-and-white illustrationsMy view: should be in hardcover!!"
5,A book not to forget,"We are talking about an excellent book in all senses. It contains very good and accurate information, it is very well illustrated and attractive. When you pass each book page, you begin to see and feel how was a casttle in the Middle Age and how people live there. This kind of books is specially suitable for children, since they are easy readable and are in a middle point between a book and a toy. A great experience!"
4,soviet kitsch album,"received in a timely fashion, great condition, thought it was going to be in a hard case, but the soft envelope works fine too"
5,that there is a star,"This is the single most original singer songwriter I've heard in years. Soviet Kitsch is start to finish completely insired and inspiring. Great compositions, a totally unique voice and singing style, original and intelligent lyrics. This CD is at the top of the stack.That there is a star folks."
3,Bjork Meets Tori,"I've listened to this CD several times and I'm not really certain that I like it yet.Some of the lyrics are touching and folksy and are perfomed with such child-like intonation that one can easily imagine the cute faces and poses that must accompany a live performance.Some lyrics and tunes are distinctly New York anti-folk or even punk, but they don't come with the punch or vitriol that they deserve.It's all done to simple melodies that are simultaneously reminiscent of Jewish folk songs, John Valby and Tori Amos and in a voice that can change swiftly between Bjork and Fiona Apple.The result is slightly disturbing. It's hard to just chill out to this music and it's hard to listen to it for its artistry. I feel like it's the soundtrack to a live theater show and until I see the show I'm missing the point.I think this CD is worth listening to just to stretch your listening ear a bit, but I don't know that it's a work worth anybody's desert island record list."
4,Reliably inconsistent and altogether pleasant,"I find Regina Spektor's music generally to be a hodgepodge of pop, folk, blues, and indie rock, all mixed together in interesting, inventive ways, with a sweet, emotive, and versatile voice to top it all off. Like Far and Begin to Hope, there are at least a couple of really powerful, moving songs, and others with which I find it more difficult to connect, even as I appreciate the thoughtful songwriting. Unlike Far and Begin to Hope, which clearly deserve 5 stars even on the basis of a handful of songs (Samson, Eet, Two Birds, Fidelity, and Better), this album has at best 2 songs (including Us) that I think will actually stick with me."
4,definitely wort buying,Thank god for tori amos... otherwise we would not have those wacky offbeat artists like REGINA SPEKTOR. the album is good worth buying. Us is her best song on the album. Give it try buy it used in case you hate it you did not lose that much money.
1,Soviet Kitsch,"I'd heard an interview with Regina and it was promoting her new album. Sounded good and when I went to order it was offered Soviet Kitsch as an add-on. Thought ""why not?"" I wish I hadn't. It's awful. And factor in that it cost more than the new one and doesn't even come in a jewel case. What a disappointment."
1,"If you like jewel boxes, DON'T BUY THIS HERE!","Unfortunately, the CD I received from Amazon is the cheap cardboard slip cover which is easily lost in one's collection. I found the jewel box version used and now I have to deal with returning the one I got on Amazon. Boo."
1,Regina Spektor in General,"Just more PJ Harvey/ Patti Smith garbage. Great for a coffee house that caters to femi-nazis, tree-huggers, Sagitarians, etc... Her best song is ""Your Honor"",......the only one getting air play. Good luck."
5,A True Original,"Regina Spector is a true original, a post-punker who sings cabaret in a sweet voice limited in range, augmented by the frailest falsetto. But it works. Her lyrics, like the best of the cabaret singers, are interesting. The tunes grab one's attention, and her spare piano accompaniment provides a setting for her haunting, often despairing, often angry lyrics. I love, love, love her!"
4,Previous reviews have been slightly off the mark,"I say, have the other reviewers been listening to the same artist? What's up with all these comparisons with Tori Amos, Bjork? Although Moscow-born Regina Spektor has been grouped together with the 'anti-folk movement', her music hearks back to those very roots she's supposed to have left. Her Russian-Jewish heritage and her classical training play a major role in her music. Regina's Slavic accent is so thick sometimes I'm wondering whether she exaggerates it on purpose! It would in any case suit the theatricality of her music. For that is another element: her music has more in common with cabaret and chansons than with the confessional ballads of her female contemporaries. In any case, I suggest that certain people return to their stereos and give Regina's music another listen before making and Joni Mitchell comparisons."
4,A strange one..but a good one,This is a very strange album..but both technically and musically its a 10!!!...Her voice is reminicscent(sp) of Laura Nyro..meaning vocally and as a composer she overall is highly talented. If you are looking for somthing new and different..this is the one!!!!!
2,Regina Spektor - 'Soviet Kitsch' (WEA) 2 1/2 stars,"Never was all that much into this singer-songwriter sort of music,at least not in the last umteen years.Tracks here I thought showed at least some promise were ""Chemo Limo"",""Sailor Song"" and the punkish ""Your Honor"".If you're into acts like Bjork,Fiona Apple or,say Cat Power,you should get more out of this CD than I did."
3,a little disappointing,"""Us"" is a phenomenal song. The muse was with her when she wrote that one. The rest of the album is just okay. I'd buy this CD again, if only for ""Us"" and the included DVD."
1,Not what I expected,"Although I normally like this genre, I found her music repetitive and sounding like she was trying too hard to be edgy."
4,"Good CD, 4 stars cause I like ""Begin to Hope"" even more.","Good CD, 4 stars cause I like ""Begin to Hope"" even more."
3,Talented Girl plays piano and sings.,"This album is oddly titled, as it has less to do with being Soviet and more to do with being an unhappy girl. I key-in on that unhappiness - because that is what makes blues work - and that is what makes this album work. She should, and did, leave the cursing out of the next album. It is not necessary to the lyrics and seems like filler material.I'd like to see her do an all punk album and explore that."
2,Interesting songs,"Some interesting songs and lyrics, but not enough of that to make it a really good album. I like the piano and the violins arrangements, but the singing is often plain irritating, nasal and forced. Not quite Brittney Spears, but not good.I would like to hear Regina when she is singing something that does not sound so ""quirky"" vocally- she can write good or even great songs. But this album is an aquired taste."
2,Not ready for prime time,"Although her voice is lovely and there is promise there, these riff's are rife with potential only. Poor production and a lousy choice of tunage disappoints."
2,If you like Tori Amos..,"... but you see I can't stand Tori Amos. Spektor has the same shortcomings. Where there is a clear gift for catchy melodies and interesting piano lines, the words amount to bad poetry, and the vocal is unbearably quirky and affected. You won't find a real person trying to communicate a genuine feeling here, whether the feeling you seek is horniness, violent rage, just-gotta-get-up-and-dance, or abject depression. Sung here are songs of an amateur discovering that words can sound cool unscrutinized, and if you act like an elf, you can enchant the foolish."
2,What's the HYPE about?,"I just saw her yesterday live opening for KEANE in Orlando. I've read all these reviews and you would think we are talking about a big POP-STAR. Not even close. Regina has a great voice and she likes to sound like a NORA JONES Hater with the scratchy and sometimes lifted ""DADDY"" voice. Good Voice.. but I would not waste my time with those lyrics. The reaction of the crowd when she said it was her last song was far more hyped then when she had already sang 8 songs... almost 12 total in 47 minutes. Regina is good, may sell song good numbers.. but FIONA or TORI AMOS style she won't be. (my opinion if she keeps those lyrics.. ""someone's pH****g to my song"") Again.. nice voice, pretty lady... need better lyrics."
4,Good deal,The supplier sent this promptly and it arrived unscathed. I haven't had time to get into the software in much depth yet but there's a lot offered for the money.
5,Pretty darn good,"I came to this product reluctantly. I own The Master Genealogist (TMG, for short). I bought it because it was supposed to be such a powerful program. Perhaps so, but I found navigating so frustrating that I figured I had nothing to loose by buying Family Tree Maker. Well, it was good decision. The program is pretty intuitive. I have been able to quickly enter data and produce useful reports. I would second the advice to get the stand-alone Family Tree program and skip buying the ""deluxe"" edition. A lot of those resources you can subscribe to online. Don't waste your money on what you may never need. From my experience, the purchase of the core program will not be a waste of your money."
2,Family Tree,"When my computer crashed, I lost my family tree files. I bought this new version so that I could install my backup files but I cannot for sme reason. I am in the process of manually re-entering my data. From the instructions I cannot figure how to read any of the accompanying discs, nor can I read any of of the discs I have from previous versions of the software."
2,"a typical ""hits"" collection",two good songs: Down Under and Cult of Personality. The rest aint that good
5,Great 70's !!!,"I often review blues music,so i'm a bluesfan.But for me it's impossible to be impassive in front of some kinds of works such this magnific Capaldi's album.What we extract from this ""Oh How we Danced""is that long distance 70's tunes with great performances,full of beautiful moments we could only find in some works from that time.I consider Jim Capaldi one of the ícons of the early 70's.We still have the great Eric Burdon...Joe Cocker...all of them with stage presences that are actually,a rarity!!This album involves me with great feelings during all the tracksand this is music of great quality.Rarity!!!!Unfortunately the youngers of today are hearing another kind of musics with poor quality!This is what they needed to get in their ears!!!This is that kind of music only for people that know what is music of quality...great quality!!!!The title track is fantastic,and ""Oh How we Danced!!!"""
2,Where Can I Buy a Pepper Pad???? PLzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,I would like to buy a Pepper Pad. Please tell me where to buy one. Thank you very much.Shirl in DC
5,Christmas with Crystal Gayle.,I was looking for some good 'Country Christmas' Cd's andboy did I found one here! The arrangements are greatand Crystal sings these sweet classic songs which everyone knows like no other.Looking for a Cd with Christmas songs to brighten up the spirit?Look no further! You just found one of the best!Have yourself a merry little Christmas with Crystal Gayle!
4,Best universal kit I could find.,I needed several styles of boot to clear my headers and this product does it as it lets you bend the boot to where you need it to clear. 4 stars because no wire looms come with it.
1,Beware of creative yet inaccurate definitions,"For those who care about the definitions while expanding their vocabulary, you want to think twice before purchasing this book.Here is an example to substantiate my warning:On page 236, ""INEXORABLE: Unavoidable, bound to happen.""But, the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Edition, has the following definition:""in*ex*o*ra*ble adj.Not capable of being persuaded by entreaty; relentless: an inexorable opponent; a feeling of inexorable doom.""In addition, this book contains a number of spelling and grammatical errors."
4,fine,"This dictionary seems to be essetial for SAT.It is a fine dictionary overall, but some definitions seem to be alike though the words have distinct meanings."
4,"Good, but not as great as I expected","I purchased this item recently. The pictures on the front were very similar to what I had envisioned for my dining room. Using the product was very easy. It took me about 10 minutes to create a beautiful cornice with a minimal amount of fabric, and no sewing. I had a few difficulties tucking the fabric in, but I was using velvets which are thick, and utilizing a few pins helped to hold the material in place. Also, the fabric did not drape as well as I had hoped, but I can easily sew a few seams to correct this. All in all, I was pleased and plan on buying 2 more of these for use in my house."
1,disappointed,"terrible product. Pieces don't fit together correctly. Poor instructions, no number to call w/ questions. It's going back."
3,Poor,This is not worth buying. Don't waste $ for this. The (so called) Extended version is really instrumental angain. This song like repeats 4 times and then Without You. Your better off just getting the Sigle of Without you 'cause it also has Never For Get You.
5,One of Mariah's best songs from Music Box!,"First of all, I have to say after reading all these other reviews that Without You is by Harry Nielsen not this Badfinger that everyone says. I have heard Harry's version and honestly, no one, and I mean NO ONE can ever do this song better than Mariah!! Mariah has the most beautiful voice in the world and everytime I hear her sing, it totally takes my breath away! Never Forget You is another of my favorites from Mariah. These two songs are so beautifully sung by my favorite singer of all time. And I love the extended version of Never Forget You because I get to hear Mariah's voice more! I love Mariah's voice and music so much and never get sick of it!!!"
2,Don't Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered a pair of Phillips surroud sound headphones at the Target website. The first thing that dissapointed me was the shipping price. Seven dollars for a light package package that would fit in my mail box. Once I opened them I was very dissapointed. The ear buds that came with my mp3 (which probbably costed five dollars) had deeper richer sound. They are not even comftorable. It's like when the doctor looks in your ears. They might have ""surround sound"" but they are not special, not worth the price."
4,Best canal-type earbuds I have tried,"I have tried 2 different models of sony canal phones - the -51 and the -71, they are not as comfortable as these. The phillips set does not seal completely like the sonys, so you don't hear your own heartbeat and breathing during quiet passages. The sonys also fall out easily if you sweat at all.These do not sound as good as full-size over the ear headphones like my Sennheiser 280Pros, but they sound close to my Sennheiser PX-100 portable on-ear headphones. For $15 at Wal-Mart, they are a great buy!"
2,"Good sound, but poorly engineered for the ear.","I bought this product, based on the impressive display and characteristics the container boasted. While the product does deliver great surround sound other impressive characteristics, this product's good characteristics are quickly outweighed by its one most problematic circumstance-They fall out very quickly usually 2-3 minutes after applying them. To ensure that the earbuds sustain themselves in your ear, you basically have to thrust them into your ear, an deep within them to the point it hurts at that. I would not recommend this product at all, not because its has horrible sound quality, but because its tendency to repeatedly fall from your ears disallows you to efficiently listen to and keep comfort with your music."
2,Frustration in a little package,"I bought these earphones because I needed to replace the stock earbuds that came with my iPod and didn't want to spend $50+. First, I have to say that other than these and the stock earbuds, I haven't had too much experience with headphones. These did sound quite a bit better than the stock earbuds. What I could not stand about them is that they KEPT FALLING OUT OF MY EARS unless I was sitting completely still - be careful not to turn your head either; they'll fall out."
4,decent earphones,"I really thought these earphones were good. They're not too expensive, sturdy, and sound decent. I agree with peoples lukeworm sound complaint but what do u expect theyre only 20$ not 100$. You can't compare them to shures' earphones. One complaint i had that especially bothered me was that the earbud things came out and got lost due to their small size and clearness. Otherwise i enjoyed these earphones and thought i got my moneys worth."
2,Ow ow ow ow ow,"First off let me say that these earphones provide great sound, BUT you can't use them for more than 5 minutes without your ears being split in two. I wore them for about 15 minutes and my ears were red for the rest of the day. I fixed this problem by cutting sections out of the plastic tubes and then melting them back together. After this they fit perfectly, but I still had a problem with them slipping out of my ears. Overall these are great earphones if you want to spend time modifying them, but I would reccomend something else..."
2,Great Sound/Nonfunctional Design,"The sound on these headphones is AWESOME--for the 30 seconds you're able to keep them in your ears. Users will find that the earbuds' conical-shape, combined with the rubber covers (you can't use the earbuds without these covers, because the metal will scratch your inner ear), allows these earbuds to constantly slip out of your ears. During a 30-minute walk, at least one of the buds (most often the left one, because of the asymmetric cabling system) must have slipped out of my ear every half-block. And the problem isn't just limited to wearing them during a workout, because they even slipped out of my ears while I was sitting at my desk. These are definitely going back to the store. (Same product as the HE592, just a different color)"
3,Impressed! But I still had to upgrade again,"I've never enjoyed earphones, so I shoppped around once I got an iPod. I will say that for the price, these phones are impressive. The surround field works well and sounds nice when you get used to it - works especially well with acoustic and voice tracks. The frequency range is better than most. The highs aren't too crisp (Only phones I had to use 'treble booster' on). Not much sound-isolation. I used them mostly on my bicycle and that's where the cons come in. They have a small screened port that creates much more wind noise than with bare ears (volume can compensate). They sometimes fall out or become loose due to sweat. The asymetric right-ear cord is a few inches too long which is irritating plus I think it looks bad. They've been used over many bicycle-miles with falls, tugs, wad ups, wrap ups, and no sign of wear or breaks so far. I say get'em if you've only used stock phones."
3,Very Good Sound,"These things have great sound quality, but they are very uncomfortable. After using them for a month (about 3 hours a day) I got used to them. I stopped using them for a month or two and then went back to them and they were uncomfortable again. The wire for the right earbud is way too long and is not very flexible. The rubber things on the buds fall off very easily. If you take the rubber things off and use the earbuds like that it is much more comfortable, but then the sound quality is really bad. In my opinion the best thing about these is the sound quality. I saw some people complaining about a hissing or buzing sound or something, I have NO idea what they are talking about. The only hissing sound I hear is when there is no song playing but my mp3 player is still on, and that is normal for earphones off all types."
3,Not bad for $20,"Ok, for $20 bucks, they're actually good. I found the fit tight and comfortable. The sound takes a little while to get used to as they are not like normal ear buds but they actually sound ok. If you want a better sounding ear bud for not too much more money, look at the Sennheiser CX300B's."
1,Not for BASS or Dance music,"What a great price. I normally spend 40-50 on Sony or even more on BOSE headphones and the surround sound idea seemed cool.They seem, as other reviews said, very tough and well made.Sadly, they sound like a surround system on HALL setting, like an echo is going on.Perhaps this works for celine dion or orchestral works but for Bass and dance type sounds it is severely disappointing."
1,Disappointing,"These earbuds are clunky and uncomfortable, but that's far from the only problem: the sound can be best described as tinny. If you listen to rock or metal or any music with strong bass you will be especially disappointed as the bass is very weak on these. Lower-priced Sony earbuds are a better bet."
2,Elephant Ears,"These earbuds are superior in sound to the competition. I own these and the Sony MDR-EX51LP earbuds, and the philips earbuds sound 40 to 50% better. HOWEVER, unless you have ears the size of an elephant, they will not fit. If you can fit something similar in size to an AA battery or tube of chapstick into your ear, then these will work. Otherwise, know from the beginning that they are WAY to big for the average person."
4,What's up with all your' freaky ears?????,"I bought these at target, after reading a bit about the product itself. Purchased in June 2005, mine came with 2 sets of silicond tips, not one.(update perhaps?) These won a 2004 design/engineering award, and feature a ""reflective"" speaker design to open air, and ""virtual surround sound"". Whatever.....I think they sound great. Very deep, rich sound, and they fit in my ears perfectly with the 2nd tip set. Positioned correctly, they do help block some external sound as well. They beat the crap out of the included iPod earbuds....now THOSE hurt for sure! They have a 24k gold tipped connector, a nice LONG cord(3 ft?) and the ""split"" y system. I do agree that the left side is jsut a tad short though, and can feel like it's tugging sometimes wit the weight of the right side cord's length. I run and work out with these, they have not fallen out once!"
5,Great Sound and Horrible Fit,"UPDATE! Boy was I wrong. I returned these the other day after my ears being in extreme pain! They were fine the first day or two, but when used for more than an hour at a time I couldn't take the pain. I can't seem to change the star rating for this review, but they are not a 5! More like a 1!I have read the other reviews about the how these sound great but fall out. I find these to be a perfect fit for my ears and very comfortable. These are the best headphones/ear buds I have tried, however I have always bought cheap ones. I think they are definately worth $20. I actually had to turn down the TruBass and SRS WOW settings in WMP since these produce better bass and simulated surround than the desktop speakers attached to my laptop."
3,Sound great and fits good. breaks in under a year.,These have to be the best headphones I've bought. The sound quality is great and it fits perfectly in my ear. But the problem i have is that one side always craps out so i only get sound in one ear. This is happened to me twice. Both never lasted a year. Now worth spending $20 on if you listen to your music alot otherwise it will break early on you.
3,GREAT BUT SUCK,I got these headphones twice now maybe going on three. they sound great i mean wow i have gone from set to set of different brands and these seem to be the best. the little rubber pieces do brake but they came with replacements so no big deal. the first pair where stepped on so i had to get another and today they stopped working right they sound like they are underwater. thought it maybe my zune but nope the headphones.
2,poor sound,"The rubber inserts broke after a couple months. The real stinker is that they never sounded good anyway. The sound is ""airey"" and they are quite loud, but lack bottom end in a big way. I've used probably a dozen earbuds over my life and these sounded the worst. Sound is a relative thing, but I'd look on if you're considering these buds."
4,review,these phones are good. They stay in your ears and the sound is fine. phones are like sunlgasses you always loose them so it's good to stick with cheap ones that get the job done.
1,Short life,"these earbuds are incredible , in regard to the sound, but they last around a month....so they are worthless"
2,Taken to the cleaners on a review here.,"Purchased these earbuds based the long and resolute review posted on here. I anxiously awaited for them to arrive in the post. Alas I was deeply disappointed. The sound is not even half as deep, rich full of bass as just the standard Apple earbuds that come with any iphone or ipod. Glad I only risked $25."
3,"Excellent Sound, I've owned six pair, two are functional due to lost parts.","These earbuds offer excellent low volume dynamics and sound quality. I keep buying them for their sound quality.But, the reason I rated them a 3 star instead of the 5 star they deserve, is the fact that the rubber earpieces come off FAR TOO EASILY and they are tranlucent, so on the office carpet they blend in, disappear and are gone forever. I recommend getting a pair of these and using JB weld to glue the rubber to the earpieces so you'll at least get eight months of use out of them before even the JB Weld give out.So I have six pair of these headphones, only two have their rubber earpieces remaining. The rest sit. If the rubber pieces were at least neon green or yellow you'd be able to see them against the carpet's pattern before housekeeping vacuums them up!"
2,Ouch!,"Whose ears are this large???As someone already stated, they only stay in your ears for 2 seconds. I'm even using the tapered inserts. They have fairly nice sound from what I can tell, but they are painful and don't stay in my ears."
3,didn't fit and so-so sound,"These wouldn't stay put in my ears. I have small ear canals and they would work there way out in about 10 steps. The sound was just okay, vocals were fine, but there was no bass; I noticed and I really don't care about bass. I bought a pare of MDR-EX51LPs from Sony, they have better bass and marginally better sound, but they fit much better, which is what matters in the end."
1,Not quite there,"Good: full sound, quality partsBad: Difficult to control volumeHissing sound constantUncomfortable/hard to keep inI just cannot use them the way I wanted to with my palm TX. So, back to my cheap pair that I got at the dollar store. I will be on the lookout for a similar, improved, product."
1,John Rae is the illustrator,"Why would someone buy this PICTURE book with no pictures???The book is charming in the original edition.No one should buy this book in the 2010 edition!. I don't know why Amazon allows these copycat ""publishers"" to reprint books without proper covers, no illustrations, etc. Ridiculous."
1,Vastly inferior to the old proceram Corningware,"After one of the French White casseroles cracked after two or three uses, I learned that the new stoneware Corningware is vastly inferior to the now discontinued Pyroceram cookware. My old Corningware is still in good shape after 20 years."
1,Twice broken,"I ordered this item and it came poorly packaged by Amazon and broken. Although Amazon sent me a replacement without charge, the replacement also came poorly packaged and broken. As this was intended to be a Christmas gift it was a great inconvenience. I doubt that I will order anything breakable from Amazon in the future."
2,Sad but untrue,"Although BTD is a fairly quick and interesting read, I remain unconvinced that the author has actually ""crossed over"" to the other side. Although she may believe the experience happened, her account varyies too much from the bible to be true. Several things stuck out for me: Pre-existent spirit babies, God the Father as a physical being (apparently in really good shape, too), and especially this sentence: ""God the Father told me that He Himself had had a mortal existence on a world like ours and had progressed along a path by choosing good over evil."" Hmmm. Compare this to John 1:1, John 1:18, Numbers 23:19, and then to 2 Cor 11:14.I would guess that Ms. Fenimore has had an intense hallucination (seriously, though, she did take a lot of pills), and it would not be a stretch to think that she has been mislead by something or someone appearing as ""an angel of light."""
1,Literary departure from the truth,"I was astonished at how Fenimore could foist such neurotic poison upon society. To claim to be dead when no life-support or hospitalization was needed is ridiculous. I commend her writing skills, as she is clearly a literary artist. However, her material is wrought with ignorance, mysticism, pretensions, and utter self-centric neurosis. Beyond the Darkness is a blatant forgery crafted by Fenimore in a feeble attempt to not only rationalize the profound confusion in her life, but to acquit and expiate herself of the selfish mistakes she has made with her husband and children. Beyond the Darkness is worth exploring simply because of the number of near-death experiences people claim to have. However, it should be approached with a great deal of skepticism, common sense, and reasoning to discern the true underlying sources and reasons to her claims."
4,2006 Corolla CE,"I bought this Scosche for my 2006 Corolla CE and works fine; initially I was looking for the ""Metra 70-1761 Radio Wiring Harness"" which is only available for US orders. The scosche was used for a Clarion CZ501, the only thing that does not work is the dimmer."
5,"Yup, its an adapter harness",It gets the job done without issues and fits like its supposed tobeats cutting up the harnessnuff said
5,Perfect fit,"Bought the bundle together (the harness and the kit) everything fit perfectly. (had some problems uninstalling my stock deck, but that was user error not equipment error lol) A lot cheater doing it yourself (stripping and re wiring) so this was a great buy."
4,Makes stereo installation much easier.,"It's a bit pricey for a very simple part, but it makes connecting a new head unit much easier. I only wish they had a harness for the 20 pin interface that's use for the steerign wheel controls (and aux input on some models)."
5,Works great!,"This adapter worked great for the installation of a Pioneer head in my '08 Tacoma. I soldered the connections and insulated them with heat shrink, plugged it in and it worked as advertised. I also recommend the Scosche single DIN mounting adapter for your install. It can be found at:Scosche TA2052B Single Din with Pocket Kit for 2005-Up Toyota Tacoma (Silver)"
3,will not fit geo prizm with Delco radio,it's made fine and would work with the proper car. this is the harness that fits every toyota of these years which is what a Geo Prizm actually is but the ones that came from GM with a Delco radio take a different plug so take a look at yours before ordering even though the application guide says it works.
5,It works,Seems to work. Self install. No noticable issues after 2 yrs of install. as is it or are to be
1,Didnt match,"I hooked up my new sterro using this harness and it did not match, the stereo wouldnt work. I was baffled,couldnt figure out what the deal was. The hot and ground wired were running to speakers, it was a mess. These usually work geat,always used them whem swapping stereos. Just was sent the wrong one this time."
1,Crap,I bought this for a 96 Lexus which Lexus is made by Toyota and it said it would fit but it does not. Its very disappointing a irritating.
1,Poor quality tint,I wasnt thrilled with this tint at all. It bubbles like crazy and sticks to its self more than the window.
3,Not bad but I prefer....,"Good book, easy reading. Reader will learn a big part of Elisabeth of Austria's life. Historical content is pretty accurate although I find that the author is interpreting to much the state of mind of the subject like the French Book by Nicole Avril ""Sissi, Imperatrice Anarchiste"". No one will ever know exactly was ""Sissi"" was thinking. The assomptions prevent the readers from making their own mind about this lovable princess. In my opinion the straightforward story of her life and the historical facts will give them a better idea of who she was. Golden Fleece and Sissi by Edgar C. Conti are perfect to learn more on Elisabeth of Austria..."
4,Pleasantly Surprised...,"I was dreading that this book would be like all other's in that it would portray Elizabeth as a poor little spoiled, mis-understood rich girl. It didn't and I found that very refreshing.My only critism of this book is that there is only one occasion when the author translated the french, german, russian, etc. quotes that were used and I found that mildly annoying as I don't speak or read any of those languages.Overall a very good book!"
5,Perfection in all regards,"Seldom do all elements of a recording come together so seamlessly as they do with Laura Sullivan's Mystical America. From the liner notes to the cover graphics to the expert engineering to finally the exquisite music, this is a CD that sits at the top of this year's releases in the category of quiet contemplative instrumental recordings. Blending her melodic piano with perfectly executed synthesizer and acoustic instrument accompaniment, Sullivan achieves musical magic on this album, infusing a true sense of majesty and mysticism in the tone poems inspired by these special places in America. If you only buy one new age music CD this year, you'll be sorry if this is not the one you choose. I couldn't recommend the album more highly. Simply put, this is a masterpiece of serenity and beauty."
2,Inquiry,"You have 4 different colors on your advertisement yet, when you order it doesn't give you a choice. How do you know what color you are getting"
3,"Not a bad book, but not great either","Much of the writing seems to be taking what could be summed up in three sentences and inflating it into three paragraphs. Sometimes she throws in literary and film comparisons that just don't fit. Some of the jokes just fall flat. The book also includes the cliche photos of ""orbs"" and ""anomalies"" that simply light leaks, reflections, and other common camera failures that appear in everyone's developed photos. There are nice black and white photos of cemeteries in the book as well.My family is an old Kilgore family, and no one recalls hearing of the ""After Dark"" ghost with the lantern in the Pirtle cemetery. Now the mention of the green glow on the grave of the lady who died of radiation poisoning and was buried in the Danville cemetery rings a bell. I don't believe in the green glow however, and a lot of members of my family are buried in that cemetery."
1,Very poor,"This book is a waste of money. Although the subtitle is ""Texas Cemetery Tales"", the book would be better entitled ""My Boring Roadtrip"". Although the author includes some descriptions of the purported hauntings and although she specifically describes herself as a storyteller, what this book utterly lacks is stories. The book begins with a description of the author's drive to one of the cemeteries, followed by a description of her drive to another. Although both cemeteries are ""haunted"", she doesn't actually describe the experience of the graveyard from her own perspective, the story behind the supposed haunting, or the reported experiences of others. In short, she tells us that she went to a cemetery that might be haunted and leaves us with nothing to actually enjoy about that fact.I would recommend that you not only don't purchase this book, but it is so poor that I would be hesitant to buy any books in its vicinity!"
4,An excellent review of non-democratic regimes,"This book gives the reader an excellent coverage of all types and subtypes of non-democratic regimes.It is ideal for scholars and students who already have a basic knowledge of military ,party or personalist dictatorships.I was looking for a book on this field for a lot of time and i must admit that it covered me 100%."
5,Wonderfully medieval! Makes one desire to dance the Pavane.,"I love this CD! It is so easy on the ears yet casts a spell which makes the listener go back and give it another go.I have all of Amazing blondel's albums but I was wondering when ""Restoration"", the CD they have just recently finished, will be available. Please...if anyone out there knows how to get ""Restoration"" it will ""Restore"" my growing love for the Amazing Blondel! They are truly Amazing!"
4,Great Gum!,"I became addicted to this gum and then wasn't able to find it in any stores. The taste is not the same as it used to be; there used to be more kick in the cinnamon flavor. Nonetheless, it still has a nice hot cinnamon flavor and is all around a great gum."
1,"If you want to watch a bad movie, watch this one","The chilean movie industry has been pretty generous since democracy came back to the country in the 90's. You can actually see it bloom. Take for example the production gap between movies as Johnny 100 pesos from 1994 (am i right?) and the award winner Machuca (2004). Both movies are good, but there is a gap, a good one.But Te amo made in Chile is like a black hole to the chilean movie industry. I'm just unable to explain how bad it is. The plot has no reason to be and it was recorded as a reality show with a handycam.If you want to watch a bad movie, watch this one."
5,"good book, a classic!!","Anyone in a current or about to be in a stepfamily, this is the ""stepfamily bible""!! Highly recommend this book for stepfamilies!!."
3,"So-so mystery, better characterizations","Not being a reader of Ms. Gabaldon before (although I understand her Outlander series is wildly popular), I was able to come to this book without comparing it to anything else she's written.And I found the book, well...it's OK, but the plot and the mystery are fairly unengaging. What kept my interest in the book was Lord John himself, who I felt sympathy for, and I'd like to know more about him, his personal life, as opposed to reading about murders to be solved, or spies; it all seemed superfluous. I found this book to be vastly more compelling when the focus was on Lord John's inner feelings & desires. I liked John's friend Quarry; he was, with Lord John, a fully rounded character. Although I was not intrigued by the mystery to be solved, my liking for and interest in John's character kept me going."
2,Lord John Dimished,"As an avid Gabaldon fan I couldn't wait for the arrival of this novel - a departure from the Outlander series, only to be sorely disappointed. Although I enjoyed Lord John's role in the Outlander series, he did not hold the same kind of interest and fascination for me in Lord John. As a matter of fact, I found that I really didn't care for any of the characters in this novel. They were neither interesting nor well developed. There were occasional gratuitous references to Jamie & Claire that served little purpose other than to appease fans. The ""private matter"" and the mystery offered little suspense. My ultimate reaction was ""who cares."" All in all, I'm still a Gabaldon fan and would like to say ""Diana, go back to the Outlander series. We want to know what's happening with Jamie and Claire."" Forget Lord John."
2,High hopes not realized.,"I really wanted to like this book, but it was missing all of the rich imagery and storytelling that made the ""Outlander"" series so appealing. It reminded me of the feeling I had reading Michael Crichton's ""The Lost World"": Like the author had some research leftover from a previous book and just slapped a new novel together to please readers. It was an interesting adventure, but not in the least bit engaging."
2,Huh?,"Disappointing. It was interesting to read about Grey, but the book as a whole reminded me of a cheesy dective mystery on old T.V. You know the one. Where there is no way to possibly guess the ending because absolutely nothing connects, then the bad guy takes the last 30 pages of the book explaining the whole plan. All the characters say, oh, so that's why. Only the reader is left dumbfounded. Normally, I reread to make sure I understand the story, but, well, I just couldn't make myself go through the story one more time. I barely got through the first time.I gave it two stars only because Garbaldon did a fine job handling the homosexuality. It was honest, but not offensive."
3,"OK, but Not Great","As mystery novels go, Lord John and the Private Matter is OK, but not great. The story takes place in 18th-century London featuring a character from the author's Outlander series. Lord John Grey is a good enough character, someone I could enjoy reading about again, but the author's style is just a little too choppy -- not giving us enough time to become really invested in the character. On an interesting note, the character of Lord John is a homosexual so we get a nice look at that lifestyle in 1750s England. The author has certainly done her research and all the characters ring true from that standpoint, but straight authors writing gay characters just doesn't work -- at least not for Gabaldon. The book is short and everything ties up nicely in the end. If the author can do a better job of developing the character and future plots, it will be worth reading more of Lord John's exploits."
3,erikamorin,"I have always liked John Grey. The animosity that he felt towards Claire was truly a disapointment and the genuine love that he had for Jamie was unfortunate at best. I had higher hopes for Lord John and was sorely disapointed that it was mostly about homosexual underground, and not more about the honor that John always seemed to embrace as a soldier.I felt that the plot was a little on the thin side and was left wanting. Sometimes the story was hard to follow and I felt that I was missing something.The detail was sometimes explicit and I would expect nothing less from Diana Gabaldon.I did enjoy this some, but be prepared to read a story about homosexual behavior. Also, there wasn't any mention of the up and coming wars as the back flap leads one to believe.It truly was a private matter that perhaps should have stayed that way."
2,"Not awful, but not that good, either","While Lord John was readable enough, there just wasn't enough to allow me to give it a more favorable rating. The scenes set in the traditional whorehouse were vivid and held my interest, but the mystery was thin, and I found myself not caring about Lord John or his private matter. Gabaldon is capable of much better writing, as she so ably proved in Outlander. It was heartening to see, though, that she's able to produce something that isn't as bloated as her recent efforts in the Outlander series."
4,Diana Gabaldon can do no wrong.,"What can I say? I love her characters, the time period and the action in her books. She can do no wrong!"
3,Another Mystery,"If there are only 4 reviews, with the highest rating 3 stars; then how does the ""Average Customer Rating"" show 4.5 stars?"
2,Lord John Gray and the Private Matter,"As an avid Diana Gabaldon fan, I have all of her books, and I grabbed this book the moment it was available. Unfortunately, for me, it was a huge let down. The book is defintely not a romance but a mystery, but in my opinion the mystery was pretty weak and I just could'nt get into the story at all. Because I have loved Diana's Outlander series, I was willing to try something different by this amazingly talented author, but after reading Lord John & the Private Matter, I have to say that I'll stick with the Outlander books from now on and pass on the mysteries."
1,Ugh-still unfinished,I started this book months and months ago and still have not finished it.It's so boring! I love her other books though.Maybe they have spoiled me.
2,Disappointing,After reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series I was very disappointed in this book. The Outlander stories grip you from the beginning and keep you wanting more. I never wanted to put those books down.The characters in this book were flat and I just couldn't get into it. Miss Gabaldon's writing in this book is just not of the same quality.
1,"This is not ""Outlander""","I bought this book hoping for a new Gabaldon sequel to rival ""The Outlander"" series. This was not that. First off the book is short, so if you're hoping for a good long, romantic, historical read--you won't get it here. While Lord John became somewhat appealing, it was short, not much of a mystery, and just generally not at the quality of writing I was used to with Outlander. I thought it a huge waste of money buying it in hardbook and would not recommend it to anyone. It is not a heterosexual love story, so be prepared. Not that that bothers me, but it was not what I expected to be reading."
1,Wast of Time,"I did not care what happened to any of the characters. Forced myself to keep reading in case it came alive. Alas, no. I just skimmed the last chapter for lack of interest.A good writer wasted her time."
2,Good writing; so-so plot.,"I was planning to like this book because I loved the Outlander series and think Gabaldon is an excellent writer. True to form, she delivers good writing again, but frankly the plot just never ""took off"" for me. The word ""insipid"" kept coming to mind. The central problems were unexciting, and even the characters seemed to think so. Too much happens inside Lord John's head, whereas I wanted to get to know him better through the eyes of others and more in-depth interactions. We readers are deprived of the thrill of discovering things for ourselves, because too much of the mystery is either disappointingly predictable; or transparent because it's spelled out either in Lord John's (revealed) thoughts, or in the tell-all discussion among several characters at the end of the book. It's a decent read, but not a page-turner by any means."
3,Weak in the plot....but a good read.,"I have greatly enjoyed Gabaldon's Outlander project, and eagerly read this book hoping for the same strong characters and enticing plots, but Lord John fell a bit short of that expectation. The ""private mater' wasn't all that interesting, but Lord John himself is a great character, and Gabaldon weaves a good tale."
3,Lord John and the Private Matter,"If you like Lord John from the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon you will enjoy getting to know him better in Lord John and the Private Matter. Don't expect to read much about James Fraser though, you will be disappointed. I was a little disappointed Lord John didn't get to establish a relation ship with a couple of the book's more interesting new characters like Nessie (the Scottish harlot) or Robert Gerard (I would have liked to have Lord John get to know him better). I liked the Tom Byrd's (Grey's valet) character and might hope future books in this line will include him as a Watson like partner to Grey's Sherlock Holmes."
3,Not your typical Gabaldon work,"My biggest complaint with LJ&TPM is that bookstores insist on putting it in the ""Romance"" aisle -- which it definitely is NOT! Anyone familiar with Diana Gabaldon's beloved ""Outlander"" series has strong feelings for Lord John, but this book represents a vivid departure from her usual narrative style and delves into the realm of the ""whodunit"", with mixed results. Those who like Lord John from the Outlander series will enjoy further morsels of his life. Those who pick up LJ&TPM expecting more Outlander, or even a romance, will be sharply taken aback. Not by the homosexuality -- with Lord John, that's a given -- but by the mystery format, and the rather heavy-handed ending that is not at all in keeping with the deftness DG's readers have come to appreciate. Or perhaps her loyal readers are simply so accustomed to 800+ page works that a much shorter work seems abbreviated!"
2,Disappointing.,"I was a big fan of the Outlander series, but it seems as if DG has lost her way. This book is way too complicated. It has too many characters with too little development. It also has a very complicated plot, made more baffling by DG's desire to keep us in suspense, and holding back explanations for events, which you are supposed to remember and be able to stitch back together as more is slowly revealed. Maybe I just wasn't concentrating enough but I found it all quite torturous and sluggish. The whole gay underworld angle, and generally the sexual side of things, come off as salacious and sensational rather than the refreshingly open and natural effect achieved in the Outlander books. I think that's because there is very little true romance or connection between the characters. All in all very disappointing. And I love the Lord John character. <sigh>"
2,"Been there, read that...","Take one part Anne Perry and one part Amanda Quick and it turns out like this book. While reading ""Lord John and the Private Matter"" I was struck with a sense of deja vu and that was because similar themes have been covered in Anne Perry's ""Pitt"" and ""Monk"" series, namely the mention of the Hellfire Club which I've already overdosed on by Perry mentioning its doppleganger in every single Pitt book, it seems, and the general ""look at these shocking mid-18th C e-vents"".). The romantic elements, mainly the preparations for the wedding and descriptions of day-to-day family doings reminded me of Amanda Quick (aka Jayne Ann Krentz) although there wasn't a sympathetic well-drawn female in the book, at least for the first 250 pages. Over-all, it felt somewhat half-arsed."
1,Dissapointing,After the love affair I have had with the Jamie/Claire books this was an anticipated delight that was dissapointing to say the least! Don't bother!
2,The private matter is public: BORING,"I have so enjoyed the OUTLANDER series by Diana Gabaldon, but in my opinion Lord John's character is really a pale shadow of the characters in the OUTLANDER series: I am unable to recommend this book to those who, like I, looked forward to a new series by this wonderful author. HO HUM!"
2,Don't waste your time,"I anxiously await each and every book in the Outlander series. Even though the story has become so drawn out and cumbersome, I just can't wait to find out what will happen to Jamie and Claire. So I bought this book in hopes that it would continue the saga somewhat. What a disappointment. This book is solely about Lord John Grey, a character in the Outlander series that is actually one of my least favorite. The story line is okay, but what makes the Outlander series so wonderful is that you care so much about the main characters. This main character does not interest me as Jamie and Claire do. And I was SO disappointed to learn that this is the first book of a TRILOGY! Does that mean that Ms. Gabaldon will now be spending her time writing more about Lord John and not finishing the Outlander series? Please, Ms. Gabaldon, bring back our favorite characters and let us know how that story ends before you start on another tangent with Lord John."
2,Lord John and the Private Matter,"I had loved the Outlander books and I felt a sense of loss when I finished them. Natually, the next step was to get the Lord John book. Even though it's unrelated to the Outlander books, I thought it would be just as engrossing and entertaining. I was very dissappointed. The story was not that interesting and the characters were not very well developed or likable. I read the book to the end, but I really couldn't care less how it ended or what happened to these people. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Lord John and the Private Matter,I was disappointed in this story by Diana Gabaldon. I love the Outlander novels and was curious about this one. It wasn't as well written as the Outlander series even though he is a character from the books. It actually didn't flow at all from the stories. Kind of like taking and ingredient from your favorite cake recipe and putting it in a meatloaf. Just didn't work. I do like Diana Gabaldon and hope she continues to entertain us with her delightful stories.
4,Lord John is a great character,"Having read all of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander books and really liking them, I had to read the Lord John Books. I enjoyed Lord John and the Private Matter due to it being Ms. Gabaldon's signature style of writing. The story line was good and the excitement was there making it similar to the stories of the Outlander series books. I also plan on reading the other books of the Lord John series."
1,"This is not writing, this is typing","I loved Outlander, though the rest of the series fell flat for me. As for this novel, it meanders through a bunch of intrigue among people that have not even been introduced (at least not in this book). There's no suspense, no character development, no action, little humor, just a lot of people blabbing at each other in various Ren Faire accents, drinking ale and eating eel pie and that sort of thing. The central character is boring. Even the plot seems like a T.V. show plot dressed in a jerkin. Except for the Ren Faire dialogue, which is of questionable historical merit, there's no flavor of the times, nothing new to learn. Too bad, Gabaldon can write like a master. But this book is like that e-mail that you get from somebody who can really type fast. The e-mail that stretches down your screen like a highway across the desert, and your eyes glaze over and you feel punished by someone you thought you liked. Very disappointing."
1,A Real Eye-Roller,"This story wasn't just told once. It wasn't. First we read what happened. Then we had to read the main character mentally re-capping what had just happened. Then we had to read the character justifying his next steps and analyzing his feelings about what had just happened (and this, too, felt a lot like the previous re-capping). It was just all too much! And Lord John did some really dumb things and made some very silly decisions in this book which just didn't make sense because he IS a smart guy (er, character). And my final complaint is how much I had to read about people lowering and raising their brows. Sometimes five or six times a page all these different characters were just going overboard with the quirking a brow and the furrowing a brow and the raising a brow and then... enough! Uncle!"
4,Lord John and the Private Matter,"Intelligently written with a great sense of historical time and place. Lord John, the central character, is not your usual hero. A solid, entertaining read."
3,Did Diana write this?,"This is not Diana's writing style or voice. I love John Grey and loved the fact that he was going to get his own book, but this book is tedious at best. Diana was caught up in to much detail about the little things but didn't pay attention to the story."
2,Disappointed,"It's been a while since I read this, but I do remember being very disappointed that it didn't have more flavor to it and that it wasn't more interesting.I was so put off by this book that I haven't read another even though I really like Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.**Spoiler**The ""private matter"" is VD."
3,Lord John and the Private Matter,"I trust Diana Gabaldon's research in all her books, so with that premise I have quite enjoyed learning about the military way of life in the middle of the eighteenth century, particularly as it applies to the officers. Of interest, also, are the everyday items of interest that populate all her books. The storyline, however, does not hold much interest to me. I hesitate to use the word ""pedantic"", but that is the one coming to mind. Her ""Outlander"" series, rich in detail, historical background, and storyline are among the very best, and I look forward to each new book (wouldn't they make great movies?).Diana's attempt to ""fill in the spaces"" with her ""Lord John"" series falls short of the ""Outland"" books. However, I will read just about anything she wishes to put into print."
2,Dissapointed,"Having enjoyed Ms. Gabaldon's other novels I found this one to be lacking in character and plot. Granted, the novel is extremely interesting in the historical sense, but it looses points for its poor story line. I thought the character of Lord John was weak in comparison to his representation in Gabaldon's Outlander Series. As well, the so called suspense in this novel is terribly poor. One is left feeling disspointed and wondering why this book costs $30.00. This book isn't really worth the price or the read. Do not expect an adventure equal to Gabaldon's Outlander series."
3,Merely a good book,"I loved Lord John in the Outlander series and I had great hopes for *Lord John and the Private Matter.* Alas, Diana Gabaldon has set the bar too high. *Lord John...* is merely a good book, where as *Outlander* and its sequels are treasured evenings by the fire. One of the other reviewers on this page admitted to being bored with Claire and Jamie. Not me. I was bored with Brianna the first time she opened her mouth. ""Selfish"" and ""self-absorbed"" come to mind. I wish she'd lighten up. But that's another review...."
1,Boring,"Being used to action and plot from Gabaldon's previous novels, I have been quite disapointed in this book. It almost looks like she cannot write short stories... Too much was missing. She touched many subject on the surface and the private matter was not all that exciting. I love Lord John's character but this novell did nothing good to it. And when you get to the end expecting maybe something good... you are even more disapointed. It's just blahhh! Of course, I will most certainly read the next one of this trilogy, but I will not buy it. I'll borrow it from a friend or the library. It's not worth paying for. Too bad. I really look forward to the next book on Jamie and Claire though..."
1,Missing something,"Absolutely loved the Outlander series, but could not get into Lord John. The details that worked so well in her other books seemed to drag down the story in Lord John--in fact I didn't make it past the 3rd chapter. Disappointing!"
1,Not up to her standards,"If you are a Gabaldon fan and really are interested in reading this book. Get it from your local library don't waste your money on it. It is not at all as compelling at her Outlander series, (and yes I do know that it was not another Jamie and Claire book) nothing at all to sink your teeth into.I couldn't even finish the book, I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. I gave up."
1,Horrible Book,"I picked this ebook while browsing for period/adventure fiction. 14 year old prostitutes, filthy plotlines and a homosexual(bisexual?) protagonist that spends his off time peering at men's genitals in the bathroom does not make a book worth reading. I was fed up by about 3 chapters. This series should come with a warning label!"
3,Not quite Outlander...,"This book was fun to read because it was about Lord John, who I loved in the Outlander series. However, it was a little confusing and hard to follow with so many characters and different things going on. If you are an avid Gabaldon fan, read it. If not, it's probably not for you."
3,Okay Mystery,"This is an okay period muder mystery book. However, it lacks the pull that her other novels have had. I would not call it a page turner and wouldn't buy another in this series."
2,Lord John and the Private Matter,"In 18th-century England, Lord John must solve a mystery of missing classified information, while attempting to keep a man with syphilis from marrying his cousin.Interesting period, interesting character, intriguing setting, and decent prose, but for the life of me I couldn't make sense of the plot. At one moment after another, the characters jumped up and yelled, ""Aha! Now we know!"" while I was left thinking ""Huh?"" One clue does not logically connect to the next. The characters' thought processes are beyond fathoming. As far as I can tell, though the large outline of the plot seems solid, none of the little bits add up.Perhaps it will make sense to other readers, but I wouldn't bet on it."
2,This is not typical Diana Gabaldon,"I had to force myself to give this book two stars; I was tempted to give it none. But to be fair, the book is beautifully written - as is typical for Diana Gabladon. It's the story I found lacking. Gabaldon fans beware: this is a murder mystery, not a romance. And this mystery, with its convoluted plot and lack of affection-worthy characters (besides John Grey, of course) didn't hold my interest. The 18th century English setting and boring plot reminded me of an Anne Perry novel."
2,Forgetable,"While I loved the Outlander series dearly, I was not impressed with ""Lord John and the Private matter."" I barely remember it, whereas the story of Clair and Jamie stays with me. I reread the Outlander stories again and again, and am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series. I picked up ""Lord John"" when I saw it, but I was disappointed that Diana Gabaldon woould take time away from the next book to write this one. ""Lord John"" is a book to read because you have nothing better to do."
1,Sorry Diana...,"First, everything else by Gabaldon -I have truly loved. I wanted to 'love' this book; but- it just never came up to par.Lord John was an interesting character- mainly the sexual aspects of his life But the story itself lacked so very much. I almost can not believe that with the story line, characters, etc that this book would have fizzled out. What was needed? I can't even begin to say. It was just a disappointment."
4,Darker side of 18th century London,"Major Lord John Grey, a soldier and respected member of Londons highest circles, has inadvertently realised that the man who is engaged to marry his cousin, has what was then known as the pox, and is determined to stop the marriage while protecting his cousin from scandal.When a soldier in his regiment is found brutally murdered, suspicions of espionage arise and Grey is appointed by the Crown to investigate and prevent the possible leakage of military secrets to France. The trail winds its way through the drawing rooms of the nobility and into the bawdy houses of Londons night world, touching pockets of treachery and corruption at all levels. This book has no connection to the wonderful Outlander series except that it uses Lord John Grey as its main character, but it really does provide the clearest,and probably closest to the truth, insight to the world on London in 1757."
3,Mundane,Although this book does provide some additional insight into John's personality and history. It was a big so what for me.
3,Lord John and the Private Matter,I prefer the Outlander series of books. I must admit that I could not get into this book after reading all the adventures of Claire.
3,Lord John - soso,"I expected something different I suppose, but Lord John doesn't inspire me to read any more about him. Give me Jaime Fraser anytime."
2,Not Up to Par,"I am an avid fan of Ms. Galbaldon but this ""fill in"" book until the next in the Outlander series is a sad commentary on her abilities. It is fairly interesting but does not contain her skills or interest in the period. I was disappointed thinking this book would quell my thirst for her writing - it was only a sidetrack into the seamier side of the period. Wait for the next book."
2,A real letdown,"Diana's other novels I have read and re-read, getting blissfully lost in them each time. But this was didn't fit with the others. A little too ""earthy"" for my tastes."
2,Don't expect another Outlander,"I greatly enjoyed Ms. Gabaldon's books about the life and times of Jamie and Claire Fraser. Never have I ventured into the ""romance"" section of a bookstore but did so to find the subsquent novels to Outlander. I find her books are like chocolate, you finish one, you want another. That is how I felt after finishing the Fiery Cross.Lord John and the Private Matter is another story. The book is not the same page-turner that you may have come to expect from Ms. Gabaldon's books. This is a quick read for a lazy afternoon. In my view, it fits in with the ""dime-a-dozen"" mystery novels that are out there. You will not miss anything about the story of the Frasers if you skip this one.I still remain a fan of Ms. Gabaldon's but will probably not pursue any further stories about Lord John."
3,I gave it a three ...,"simply because of the love of the Outlander series. She tried to make his character into a book, but it just didn't hold my interest. I skimmed the last 30 pages once I found out the mystery. I hope she comes out with more about Jamie and Claire and leaves John Grey behind!"
3,Not the captivating mystery I had hoped for.,"Although the first chapter starts off with syphilis, murder and adultery, I found my interest waning by the third or fourth chapter. While I was not expecting an Outlander book, I did expect the snappy dialog and well-developed characters that I have come to love in Gabaldon's writing. Finishing this book felt like homework."
3,a detour...,"Lord John and the Private Matter is simply a detour on Gabaldon's quest to finish the Outlander saga. Like other readers, I haven't been as captivated by this novel as I expected, in spite of being fond of Lord John in DG's Outlander novels. At times, it seems like a gratuitious exercise in eeking more money out of her fans with all the name dropping (Fraser, Fraser, Fraser?), but there are brilliant moments when you can be transported back into 18th C. London. As the first in a Lord John ""trilogy"" (would that be like the Outlander Trilogy now numbering 5 and counting?), I will continue reading them until it becomes utter dreck. DG can only improve these stories."
4,Gabaldon has created an excellent new series of books,"After reading all of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series books, I started to read the Lord John books, not expecting to like them as much. This book was a thoroughly enjoyable read. I've read all three of the Lord John books now and am looking forward to more. I would advise reading the Outlander books first, since there is a lot of information in the Outlander books that is referred to in the Lord John books."
4,Lord John and the Private Matter,I really didn't know what to expect with this book. I read all Diana Gabaldon's books and thoroughly enjoy them all. This one I can only say was very different. It ended quite abruptly for me and I could see a few more chapters could have been written to ease into the ending.
3,Average Reading,"Lord John is an interesting, compelling character, and the historical details Gabaldon immerses us in are fascinating. The mystery itself, however, is less than riveting. Lord John's homosexuality is treated tastefully and respectfully, a rare find for literature of this time period. His personal relationships are described a bit too discretely. I enjoyed this book, but it is missing the usual magic that Gabaldon weaves."
2,disappointed,I couldn't begin to tell you what Diana and her Outlander Series means to me! She is my favorite author and those are my favorite books...to say the least!!!But...Lord John and the Private Matter really isn't for me! I like the character of Lord John in the Outlander series...but going deeper into his life and finding out what arouses a gay man is just not in my taste of reading. I'm trying to finish the book...but having a hard time with it. Diana has always been able to mezmerize me with her writting skill and I'm just not finding that in this book.I'm disappointed in finding that this will be a series...I wish Diana would concentrate on the Outlander series and give her devoted fans what they truely crave...I'd love to loose myself once again in a wonderfully well written and romantic novel by Diana Gabaldon! ...my favorite author!
3,"Get thru the Private Matters, you'll enjoy the rest of the series","I absolutely love Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series. A friend read the ""Lord John"" series as well, and recommended them to me. She told me up front that ""Private Matter"" would be hard to get through, but worth it when you get to the next books in the series, and I found this to be true. I crave any hint of Jamie Fraser, and he is mentioned. I'm currently reading ""Brotherhood of the Blade"" and find that it's much better than the first (""Private Matters""), and there is much more of Jamie in the second book (""Brotherhood""). I'm looking forward to reading the series, just get yourself thru that first book, and it gets better!"
4,This book took a little time to get into,"I enjoyed the role John played in the Outlander series, and picked this up hoping to read more about his relationship with Jaime and Clair. At first I was dissapointed to find this book had nothing to do with them and put it down. I'm the type of person who has to finish a book when I start it, though, and I'm glad I picked it back up. The book was an enjoyable little mystery with great characters and atmosphere, and I look foward to the next book in this series. It took me to places that most people never even think about when reading about Regency England. The ending was not what I expected, but that in itself was refreshing. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't yet read this book. Read the book, but don't expect it to be the next Outlander story."
2,Eh...,"First impressions: it's blue. Not the nice, lighter blue gradient as the photo indicates, but actually true blue. Not happy about that, as I wanted this to match the ""blue wave"" Jambox I recently ordered.Next: the fit. It DOES fit but around the sides it's not snug whatsoever. I ""feel"" like the slip cover will come off as a result, but it won't. Yet, because it is not a snug fit, I always get that uneasy feeling the thing will come off.Not a good buy. Luckily it was $1.95 + shipping, so I am not going to lose sleep of this one."
2,Disappointing,"It would be an understatement to say that I was disappointed with this book. The whole style of this manual is like something that you would get handed at a seminar. This book supposedly shows how to build a Mook Jong dummy for cheaper than those available. However the details are very sparse. In addition I would question the usability of the dummy constructed...This is the first one that I have seen with the arms constructed of steel pipes. There are much better plans available for free on the web, my advise therefore is save your money."
2,Cheap Man's Dummy,"Although innovative in many ways, this guide to making cheap muk jongs is not worth the price asked. If it were priced at $9.95, it might be worth a look, but at $16 plus shipping it lacks enough in content to make it not worth the more expensive price.Having said that, it should be noted that this book explains how to make a cheap man's version of a wooden man---NOT a traditional Wing Chun dummy. Keep in mind, the title of the book is ""The Mook Jong Construction Manual"" not ""How to Make Your Own Traditional Wing Chun Dummy."" It is a guide to making an economical muk jong which mimics the Wing Chun wooden dummy, but lacks the beauty and finesse of the real thing. Contrary to what's stated, you will need some carpentry skills, tools, and an abundant amount of time before it's finished.Finally, the details in the construction procedures and b/w pictures shown were good enough for a novice to contruct a dummy."
1,Disappointed,"It seems that the author completly missed the point. Traditional wooden dummy measures are mostly wrong, since they are based on false assumptions. Look for correct measures at the internet, for free. Woodwork techniques descriptions are fine and the mounting system description may be useful, but again, there are better ones available for free at the internet. Its ""human response"" dummy still has to prove its usefulness."
2,Terrible,The arms and legs and body of the dummies that this man is making aren't even close to the traditional sizes. If you are looking for an idea or drafting plan on how to make a real traditional dummy don't buy this book.
1,When I saw his product it ruined my day,"Waste of time and money unless you want to build an unorthodox-ed dummy. Part of the title says traditional, but there was nothing traditional about his traditional dummy. Bad Dobi."
5,Great.,"So glad I found this one. It's the original live version. I listen to it daily. A classic, original worship album."
2,A++++ Kiss The Son Cd Kevin Prosch,Love this item!!!! I am really happy with this purchase. It shipped quickly and it came in great condition and I have been enjoying it since!
4,Creeped Me Out,"Although this movie was cheaply made, I have to say it freaked me out something fierce. When I watched it on VHS, I had a cat that looked just like that creepy feline in this movie. I wouldn't go near him for weeks after seeing this, freaked out that an alien or whatever that thing was, would come out of him and kill me! All and all its one of those cheap movies that you could watch for a laugh or scare if you have a cat that looks like this one."
3,Uninvited rats,"It's made for kicks, though the only good acting was from the cat, and the rest of the cast was laughably bored. Though I admit I like this film for the simple fact I hate cats (even though there are specific, horrible horror cat movies, I mean killer cats? Willard (1971) worked and was convincing, but killer cats? Give me a rat).It was a nice try and an original idea, but cheap effects and bad acting ruin the film. Too bad they never made a sequel. I wouldn't have rented it.All I can say is, yes this film is very cheaply made, however, what do you expect when you rent a film about a killer cat with a rabid mutant in its mouth?"
4,So bad it's actually good.,"Plot: A cat with a mutant creature inside of it escapes from a lab and is eventually taken aboard a yacht where he attacks and infects (it's blood has some weird mutating contagion) some college students, a businessman and his bodyguard, and the captain of the ship.This is one of those low budget 80's horror movies that sinks so low it actually becomes entertaining. Yes, the plot is stupid, the dialog really bad, the acting completely unbelievable, and the creature looks like a kid's raggedy stuffed animal, but despite everything I actually liked this movie. Some of the scenes are both ridiculous and disgusting but I loved all the pulsating veins, popping skin and gushes of blood. My advice is don't take this movie too seriously and just enjoy the ride."
2,"Good flick, Bootleg DVD","The film is solid entertainment. Thanks to it's overall silliness, nifty mutant cat puppets, and classic horrible dialogue, it never approaches boring. It's well worth a purchase for b-movie fans, despite the vhs quality picture, lack of extras, and extremely shoddy cover (mine looked like it was printed on a home printer that was running out of color ink). The whole package feels like a bootleg."
4,Do you like Yixing teapots?,"Interesting book but would be a mistake think it's just a collection of Yixing teapots'photos.Author develops his ideas about an ""affinity"" between teas and ""not glazed"" teapots like Yixing's.Some ideas are good some others arguable but this book worth a reading."
4,a great book for teaware buffs,"Superb photos of superb teapots. This book made me realize that the pots I was buying are junk. You'll have to save up for real Yixing. Some historical background. Some of the text is wasted on the author's odd tea theories, but it is amusing reading. The book is reasonably priced considering the esoteric subject and outstanding photography. The craft and beauty of Yixing is simply breathtaking. I wish there were good books available detailing the history and the artisans who currently make this teaware."
4,Heartfelt voice,"Bryan Fair's book is both analitical and personal demonstration of why affirmative action is still necessary in this country, despite all the diatribe against it these days. Based at the University of Alabama and familiar with the administrative practicalities of implmenting affirmative action programs, Fair gives a wake-up call to all those white males who seem to think that affirmative action's time is past and it's finished it's work.Fair points out that we'd be creating a minority underclass without AA, and how this would increase tension and make society worse for everyone, minority or not. Most tellingly, Fair inserts his own personal experience as a child in a family with 10 kids. With no AA, people like him wouldve been left behind. An important read."
4,A Fine Book to Inspire Gold Rush Fever Nostalgia!,"This book gives a journalist's view of the Yukon Gold Rush of 1896 (and beyond) in a most enjoyable way. It's particularly excellent reading if you've been recently inspired with that topic by a visit to the area, which includes Skagway, AK - a common cruise ship stop. (Which I recently thoroughly enjoyed.) Expect little, and be surprised by how much grows out of the little insights your newsman (the author) keeps feeding you regarding the people of that unique era!"
2,pink eyes,"great shipping. However, the color of the eyes were bright hot pink, contrary to what I can see through the monitor. :\"
3,Not what expected,"Definitely thought it would be much larger and after spending close to 15 I thought it should be pretty big, but it fit on my palm! I'm disappointed."
5,Sometimes you are better on your own!!,"Rented this before on a whim. I've rented it several times since (am now buying it to save money!). It is one of my favorite indy films. A fun story about three roommates who head to Vegas in search of Mr. Right Now, and what they learn about themselves along the way. I highly recommend it!"
2,A Worthy Effort,"I ordered this book on a recommendation, but found it to lack depth and substance. I was also distracted by the numerous editing errors and typos in it. I will give Linda Blair credit for a worthy effort on her part for a first book, and I believe in her cause, but I didn't learn anything new in it. However, that having been said, there is an extensive list of vegan resources which I found helpful, and I also found the typical day's eating for several vegans helpful. She touches on several issues concerning a vegan lifestyle, but doesn't really elaborate on any of them. The book is a little pricey for its content in my opinion, but good if one has read nothing else on the subject."
5,"""Mental"" illness?","I would like to make a statement that everyone should read this book and not just people that are in the mental health field or suffer with a mental illnes. Brett's journey is a story in itself and a very well-written one. I have believed in his theory for a long time now and having dealt with mental illness in my own family and have also worked within the system. I read this book in two days and could not put it down. It was his story and the way that it was written, was exceptional. I cannot say enough about what a great read this was. Please do not miss out on this book. You will be thoroughly pleased with the end result.Marcy Boynton"
5,Amazing Book!!!,"A friend told me to read this book because she said it was better than works by James Frey and Frank McCourt (and definitely better than Brooke Shields) -- without the hype. After completing it, I agree. This memoir was so rich and so alive that I couldn't let it go. From start to finish, it gripped me. And it did so in different ways. At times it was painfully sad, especially the struggle for sanity in the face of psychiatric oppression. But then, inevitably, it shifted into something so funny I would bust into laughter. And, even more, it was educational. It taught me about a crisis in mental health that affects millions of people. I can't say enough positives about it. Read this book. Treat yourself."
5,My daughter loved the costume!,She even refused to take it off. it is well made and can be used for several years so we plan on keeping it for our next child or friends/relatives children.
1,Not as pictured.,The owl head lays much flatter to the head than in the picture. It just looks like a hoodie from the front-you can't see the owl face/head unless you look down at the topof my daughters head. Not as pictured-is sits way above the head in the picture. Returned it.
1,Very poorly mastered,These DVD's are for the most part unwatchable. I am a Trinity fan. Thought this would be fun. But the quality is absolutely terrible. Cramming two movies onto each side of a DVD results in a poor watching experience. And there are a lot of video and audio dropouts. This is worse than watching UHF on a B&W; TV in the 70's when you are just barely able to pick up a signal.Save your money.
1,A Disappointment,To say that the Spaghetti Western Bible Vol. 1 was a good idea that Grindhouse poorly executed is a statement of kindness for they truly bungled everything but the packaging of this DVD release. I will not purchase other Grindhouse releases.
3,spaghetti bible,I think Grindhouse needs to make a sequel to this original ten movie concept. I enjoyed all of the movies even though the visual quality was bad at times. These were movies I watched as a teenager at the drive-in. This in itself brought back many fond memories. A lot of these movies I HAD seen only once but when I started to get into them it all came back to me and it will you.My favorites were the two guys doing the Bud Spencer and Terence Hill act. They were very good. The other movie was Sons of Trinity which had me holding my sides from laughing so much. I just wish these two guys made some more films together. Anyway I felt I got my money`s worth just wish once again the quality of the pictures was better. RICKO
5,If you like Grindhouse type movies you should like these,"All these Grindhouse Experience releases are usually the same with varied quality of VHS transfers, But in this collection the movies are quite fun to watch, they are not all spaghetti westerns, Bud Spencer & Terence Hill are still great & on here are some I have never seen, also I enjoyed Kid Stuff with Michael Coby & Paul Smith playing Bud & Terence. Grindhouse Experience for me so far is the Experience of new & unseen territory of ""B"" Movies from the late 60's through mid 80's, If I hadn't seen these from the Grindhouse Collections I most likely never would have gotten to see them. If you like Grindhouse type movies then you should love these as I do."
4,Unusual and delightful,"Stackridge plays music that is hard to define. There are suggestions of folk influences, but played with a psychadelic/rock slant. There is a great deal of orchestration on some tracks. Many songs are haunted by delightful melodies, especially the title tracks and There is no Refuge. The words are wonderfully quirky on others.There is a dischord on Purple Spaceships Over Yatton, that I once read was due to a mistake in the score, that makes me wince whenever I hear it.I regard the album as a must have for discerning collectors of music from this extremely inventive period in English popular music history. The music is likely to appeal to fans of artists like Fairport Convention, Kevin Ayers and Nick Drake whose output is also difficult to encapsulate in any one genre."
5,good for teaching ESL,"Although intended as a lesson on occupations, the book also serves a purpose in the ESL classroom. The book is written in a simple pattern which renders it easily comprehensible by ESL students. (""Who helps Mr. Noisy find a good book? The librarian."") So it could also supplement a lesson on the interrogative form.Watch the price, though; the book is only 16 pages."
4,TRACKLISTING:,"Track List:1 To Mourn This Day As The Last2 Cutting Losses3 Seventeen Percent4 The Omega Principle5 The Lead Balloon6 Pretty Mouth, Green My Eyes7 An Officer's Farewell8 Two Hundred Stitches9 Soft Voices Die10 Standing Outside A Wave Function"
3,An odd one - this ......,"By 1981's ""Winners"", the BJ's had left the fold of Quincy Jones and this marked their commercial demiseHowever, although this album was nowhere as commercially successful as it's predecessors, it is in no way a bad albumThe album still has some very good funk songs, i.e ""The Real Thing"", the great ""Teaser"" (with great horns and guitar-work) and ""Do It For Love"" with trademark great bass licksThere are also some great mid-tempo songs, particularly good is ""Sunlight"" and ""Caught Up"", the latter featuring the vocals of Valerie JohnsonHowever, there are some ""odd"" moments, namely the rocky ""Hot Mama"" and the finale ""Daydreamer Dream"" which is quite possibly the oddest track on any of their albums - could easily be an Abba B-side!However, this album was worth it's purchase price ... just try getting one on CD .... if you find one, hang onto it .... it's worth a small fortune"
2,Not one of MY favorites from a favorite singer!,"I am a big Nina Simone fan, but this is not one of my favorites. Try ""It Is Finished"" instead. Currently, both of them, and ""Black Gold"", are available in a two disc set titled ""Emergency Ward"". Nina's rendition of ""Obeah Woman"" (from ""It Is Finished"") IS an essential recording!"
5,Connects the Dots,"I enjoyed reading this short book about Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her times because it told me just enough about her and fitted her thoughts and ideas into what was going on intellectually in the United States at the time. I appreciated the connections made between her type of feminist thinking and that of others before and after. It made me think, too, about my own feminist philosophy. And, once again, I was surprised by the depths of male chauvinism through the ages."
1,too narrow,These were the narrowest pair of D size shoes I have ever tried on. I don't care how nice a shoe looks. If it don't fit it just don't fit.
4,"Kind of bulky, but strong and reliable.","I would just add one or two speeds... a slower one at least would useful, and a way to change thickness of the pasta without the need to get the motor out everytime."
1,This album stinks,"I was pretty disappointed with this album. Like one of the other reviewers said, every track sounds the same, just background noise. Though, the first track, ""Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt"", is particularly grating. I'm sending this one to the second-hand store promptly."
4,Pretty Good,If you like alternative music this one is good. I would put it in thee category with Fall Out Boy and Panic At The Disco. If you listen to the lyrics they say some pretty honest things. I like it.
5,the scientists have created goodness,"this album is really good. really good. i don't like emo, and this is like...borderline emo. like they keep dipping their toes in the emo pool, but they're pretty wet with raw rock and roll. the singer almost sounds like the singer of the Arctic Monkeys( another awesome band you should check out if u haven't.) they're good rock. they have plenty to come in the future."
4,Quite Catchy,"I found out about WAS while I was in England and saw ""the great escape"" video. Their lyrics are sarcasitcally clever and quite humourous. It's quite a fun album to listen to if you're in the right mood. It's some of the better alternative rock that america has done recently."
4,Good stuff,"I havent been keeping up with music so much lately, but I guess seeing three dudes holding cats would make anyone pick up a cd. I am definately glad I ran into this. Its good all around in the sense that they make such a repetitive genre sound so fresh. Better than Elefant's last effort for sure. If you like the new sound thats goin around this is one to get."
4,Excellent!,"All the songs are unique and most are good in their own way, but there is one song that truly excels and has the potential to be a large hit. That song is ""Lousy Reputation"". It begins quite innocuously with repetitive bass line and calm vocals, transcends into a drum-bashing pre-chorus, and finally dissolves into aural orgasm with the chorus. Repeat. Unfortunately, I see no signs from it actually becoming a hit despite its utter awesomeness. But you should still buy this album if you like Hot Hot Heat, The Killers, or possibly the Bravery. Quite a good buy."
4,pretty good but its about time to end the series,"I'm not sure who really does most of the work in writing this series, Marcinko or John Wiseman, but it's about like the others good but not great. If you can stand Marcinko's f--- this and f--- that dialog I think the story has a lot to it. I've noticed in the last book or two that the sories are beginning to wear down and in this book Marcinko himself mentions getting old to do these missions so maybe its time for him to retire."
4,Another double-barrelled dose of action!,"The Rogue Warrior once again shows his warrior spirit in overcoming incredible odds. I was disappointed with some of the characters that seemed a little weak (Steve Sarkesian, the main bad guy, for one), but all in all a worthy read for the Rogue's fans."
1,"Very high price, very little content",The content of this book has been in Time and Newsweek magazine. It is not a manual. It is a Cliff Notes of SEAL history and information. Unfortunatly they left out all the information one might want.
5,a must,"one of the best collection of songs for this artist. great recording, brings back so many memories..."
1,???,I might be interested in buying this video if there was some description about it...when was it made....who made it for what audience. A little help here...
1,No description?,"I would like to know if this is a documentary on alcohol (use, abuse, addiction), since I am an addiction counselor & may be interested in buying this, but it lacks a description. Thanks, Wilma Polk, Quantico, MD"
3,Soft spot shoes,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
5,Dust My Broom,Another fantastic Elmore recording--my 2nd favorite---I have gifted this cd to a couple of friends at Xmas!!!!!! Super recording--will always buy another copy.
3,Lucky Seven,"Nice movie with a great cast; however the ending is very obvious.The extra ""behind the scene"" part is very short."
5,One of my favorite movies!,"I found this at Hollywood Video last night, and had never heard of it. (I don't have cable). But, I like Dempsy, and knew it had to be good. From start to finish it was a great movie! Dempsy is so dang hot in this movie!!! And the chemistry between him and Kimberly Williams is so strong. I'm watching it again tonight! (Hey, I get it for 5 days!!) I will probably watch it 5 times before dropping it off. ;-) But, you won't go wrong with this movie."
4,solid romantic comedy,"This is pretty standard romantic comedy fare. It basically boils down to one woman making a choice between two men. Yes, it's predictable, which is not necessarily a bad thing in this genre. You'll know right away which guy she'll end up with, but it's the guy you want her to end up with and there are some light moments along the way.The DVD also has some trailers and a making-of featurette."
4,Finding Mr. Right...,"We all have a picture of who our Mr. Right should be; how he should look, dress, act and be. This movie shows you that you can meet your presumed Mr. Right and it still doesn't fit because your soul mate sometimes comes in a package you least expect. I don't want to give too much of this movie away. Just watch it. It's a good lesson for us gals in our mid to late twenties plugging on through life and searching for the one. It's McDreamy ladies... need I say more?"
5,Unexpected Gem,"After seeing this surprising film, it's gone into the same place on shelves as ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" and ""The Very Thought of You."" The storys differ, but they all deliver a blissfull dose of satisfaction and bliss upon viewing. What's amazing is that ""Lucky Seven"" was made for television and yet still delivered such a great production. Definitely has made it into my all time favorite romantic comedies and I hadn't even heard of it before seeing it for sale on DVD. Took a chance and I'm all the happier for it.Now... let's see how my wife likes it when she get back into the country."
5,*Great Movie!*,I loved it!One of the best romance movies I have ever watched.One I can watch over and over.Kimberly and Patrick were excellent in this movie.A great movie to make you feel good.
4,PREDICTABLE,THIS MOVIE WAS VERY PREDICTABLE BUT CUTE. IF YOU LIKE A SAPPY MOVIE THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU. I LIKE SAPPY MOVIES...
5,Lucky 7,"Charming. Sweet, feel good movie that is good to watch over and over...especially don't mind watching Patrick Dempsey over and over again."
5,Why is this man so uncelebrated?,"Nash's work is too often regarded as light and meaningless; admittedly some of the work is very much ""of it's time"" now, but it is largely rich, diverse, insightful and wonderfully clever.The rhymes are complex and intriguing and form great volumes of biting social comment. They are deliciously constructed and achingly funny at times.Yet he seems to be an almost forgotten ""Children's"" poet, even if this were the case, are not some writers for Children so good as to far exceed the virtues of those who write for adults?Rhold Dahl, J K Rowlins, Lewis Carrol and E Nesbitt spring to mind, Nash needs also to be on that hallowed list.He really should be regarded as an American National treasure!"
4,Poetry as fun,"Ogden Nash is a poetBut he doesn't noetIf you love lines that do not bother too much about archaic rules of spelling and poetry, and are out to have fun, then here is a world you cannot miss.This book is best enjoyed read aloud, with a few friends, with a few drinks:-)"
4,"His verse does not curse, Ogden Nash ain't white trash",Nash's little lines are often amusing and sometimes memorable. They are of course light verse and not the kind of poetry which can win a true place in the canon. There is often certain feeling of Brahmin prejudice in them and a sense that many are outdated.
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,BEST GUM I HAVE EVER HAD! HOLDS FLAVOR LONGER THAN ANY OTHER I HAVE EVER CHEWED. LIGHT FRESH TASTE IS WONDERFUL!!!! HARD TO FIND IN STORES! I AM SO GLAD I CAN BUY IT THROUGH AMAZON.XOM! I AM A REGULAR BUYER OF LEMON ECLIPSE BURST GUM!!! WONDERFUL!!!
2,Drop in the Ocean,We use webservices at my company to let other systems interface with our products. I buy a lot of technology books and the majority of them are from Oreilly.This 300 and odd page coverage of web services essentials is the most shallow coverage that i have ever seen. It has helped me to no extent except understand the multitudes of jargons in the web services world.
1,"All bones, no meat",This book is really lacking on much useful information. It's mostly a high-level overview. For anyone seriously interested in web services I'd recommend getting a different book!
2,Obsolete and belated book,This book is based on obsolete specifications and older SOAP implementation which is not even available for download. The Apache SOAP is already a piece of junk and Apache recommends to use Apache Axis (which is not in the scope of this book). All other implementation examples such as XMethods and UDDI4J are also obsolete as well. The APIs are already deprecated and the code discussed does'nt make any sense.
2,Understandable but be warned it's 10 YEARS OLD!,"I bought this book for my Kindle today and was enjoying it until I tried to access the first example web site it pointed out. The URL doesn't work, and there's no errata published for it.That was when I finally noticed THIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED IN 2002, nearly 10 years old.I should have done a better job of due diligence, but really either the book should be updated so the examples work or it should be withdrawn.Just to be clear my issue is not with the age of the book-- It's that the links are stale and they (all that I tried) don't work. The information presented may still be true but there's no way to check your understanding of what you've read.Gave it a 2 star rating on the assumption that what it says is still true, a big assumption after so long."
4,Good little old book,"Although an old book, this book explains very well web services. It has detailed explanations on XML-RPC, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI.Make no mistake. The book is old and just like some other reviewers pointed out, some of the technologies have been replaced by newer ones. But once you understand how web services work, it's easier to adapt to the newer tools.The author also has a tendency to add 'filler pages'. The last 50 pages are useless which is why I gave it only 4 stars."
4,Song of Survival,I had heard the recording and was curious about the story. What an amazing demonstration ofthe power of music to heal.
5,amazing,"it is amazing to me that someone could recall large pieces of difficult classical pieces and than transcribe it into vocal form from instruments. i watched the movie paradise road and then read this book and i didn't appreciate the feat that they accomplished musically until in the book it talked about some modern vocal groups that have replicated the music vocally and that there is a challenge vocally to emulate instruments, especially when holding a note for several bars, not really knowing where in the counting one is...hope i am describing this correctly...and that you get what i am saying. it is amazing to conceive. i think that it is incredable that here is some technical music that this woman first of all flawlessly recalled and then taught it to some women who had little to no musical background and then years later when it was taken to a music dept at a university, people who are well versed in music found it challenging."
2,Pretty color but it's cheap,Love the color but this is a lightweight low quality frying pan. I used wooden or silicon utensils to prevent scratches but the non-stick did start to peel off - had to trash it since once it does that it's toxic. I always used low heat when cooking and was very careful not to scratch the surface. The coating came off in pin hole type marks - not sure if I just got a bad one but I switched to a higher quality pink frying pan (see my reviews) and am much happier with them. I don't recommend this.
4,Great pan!,"My husband bought this for me, since I love pink. It was kind of a joke gift - pink frying pan, now we've heard it all! However, I have many really expensive pans, heavy, etc,. but this is the pan I go for more than any other. The non-stick is great, clean up is super easy, but it's lightweight which makes it easy to handle. I highly recommend this pan."
2,"Lame, IMO","I read the other reviewers so tried to read ""A Perfect Life"" with an open mind. However, I found the plot to be all right, but did not end up sharing the opinion that this author deserves such praise. His protagonist seems rather slow to realize what is happening to his life. I never understood who the jazz man was, or why he took an interest. I finished the book, still not with any sense of satisfaction. I found the statements describing the sex act to be ridiculous. Very juvenile ""tube steak??"" Come on.Pleased that 5 of you liked it, but I will bypass this author. I am an admirer of Deaver, DeMille, M. Connolly - well you get the picture, and they are terrific at their craft. I congratulate Mr. Stewart for finding a publisher."
5,Vintage Doug,"This classic of Texas music is best experienced on vinyl, and well-loved vinyl at that. If you are new to Sir Doug and are unaware of the legendary Sir Douglas Quintet, this particular record will do you well, especially in this day and age of cell phones, awkward sweaters and square glasses, suicidal stock markets and Smart cars that seem so dumb. Do yourself a favor and take this trip with Sir Doug and the original Texas Tornados, including the patron saint of the Vox Continental himself, Augie Meyers. Throw it on, crack a beer and run your toes through that long shag carpeting. You'll be glad you did."
4,Family Tree Maker,This software ROCKS. I spent 20 years trying to find any evidence of my Gr-grGrandfather. I bought this software to help me maintain my files and I was able to find my lost ancestor with a Search. I now have charted close to 85% of my Family since the arrival of the Original Emmigrant from France. I highly recommend this software to anyone.
2,No Support for Version 11,"I have used older versions of Family Tree Maker for years and liked it. I decided that with a newer version I would take advantage of the on-line features offered. I ran into trouble when I tried to register the product. I finally called the telephone number provided for support and found that the company that bought Broderbund does not provide support for this version, only the new versions. They did not want to talk to me once they found I was using a brand new copy of Version 11. Because I could not even register the product, I cannot use any of the on-line features. It works just fine for building a family tree, but I thought I paid for more than that."
4,If you travel or need music at work they are a must have,The Philips Travel Speakers are a must if you are a traveler or need music at work. I use these speakers everyday. The sound quality is great. You can't beat the bass that pumps out of these tiny speakers. The only down fall that I can think of is the grips. I think the box states that you can clip the speakers on your laptop but they slip off constantly. Other than that they are worth purchasing.
2,"Great Sound, Poor Design","I was very excited to use these with my laptop. Cargo magazine had reviewed them in their October November issue as Best in Class.When I first set them up I was pleased with clip-on feature since it saved valuable desk space. The sound was great compared to my built-in laptop speakers too.After a couple of days through, the speakers refused to stay clipped to the laptop screen. I tried cleaning display, the rubber pads on the clips and shimming the clips too but they just didn't have the strength to hold on.At this point I gave up and returned them to the store. Too bad nobody else makes something this unique that works for more than a few days."
1,"Awful,just AWFUL!!!","This album is absolutely awful music!!! This album is music for pre teen girls,but certainly not anyone with a mature taste in music. I really find it hard to believe anyone could actually stand to listen to this stuff! This is bland,boring,pointless,tasteless,immature music.I hope these guys never make an attempt at music again!! Your money is better spent elsewhere.Stop massive-musical decline and buy something with flavor (like Justin Timberlake)When are we going to be able to rate albums with zero stars? This doesn't deserve the 1 star I gave it!!!"
2,The Sophomore Jinx strikes again,O2 is a collection of what?? After listening I'm not sure where this band is headed. It's obvious they have moved in a different direction from their first album and it's evident from the albums place on the billboard charts. O2 will fade into oblivion without a strong single to back it up. These are the days is not it.
1,Geez...what next?,"OK...I'm into the whole pop boyband thing, and I liked the first album a lot, I mean A LOT. With this one, I don't even know where to begin. They tried to take their music in a completely different direction, and if you ask me, totally failed. They were really good, and now I can't stand them. It seemed as though they were forced to write music, and tried way too hard. My sincere advice to the consumer reading this is buy the Justin Timberlake album instead, you'll be much more satisfied."
2,A Boring CD,"I love O-Town, don't get me wrong but in comparison to their first album this one is BORING! The only song that held my interest is ""I Only Dance With You"". It seems as though they tried harder on their first album than on this one. When I was listening at first I thought I bought a heavy metal CD. All I'm saying is that if you want this album wait until it hits the ""Bargin Bin""!!"
2,oh not these boys again,the pop syndrome continues on here with otown giving us a second dose of their weak bubblr gum flavor.
1,O Please...,"TRACK LISTING:1. From The Damage2. These Are the Days3. I Only Dance With You4. Favorite Girl5. I Showed Her6. Been Around The World7. Make Her Say8. The Joint9. Suddenly10. Craving11. Over Easy12. Girl Like That13. You Can't Lose MeAfter studying O-Town's new album, ""O2"", i realized that it is probably the worst album recorded this year. Their debut album, O-Town, had ""All Or Nothing"", the only decent song ever recorded by the TV-bred boy band. All of the songs on ""O2"" are AWFUL. Don't even think of hearing a good song on this record. The worst track is definitely ""The Joint"", since when did these little dweebs decide to try to do rap music? And even if they could, it would be awful. Why did Nelly guest star on this album? Do not buy O2, that's all i can say."
4,Great sophmore album. different style that works!,"i got this album first thing in the morning of the release. i was hoping it would be good, since i liked the group, but prepared for the worst. i was pleasently surprised! it's a great album! they got a new feel to them music, more rock into it, but they still included a few r&b styled pieces. a nice mix, and well worth my money. too bad the songs Death Wish + American Game were withheld. i thoroughly enjoyed those at the concerts... hopefully they'll turn up on a import somewhere. enough from me, GO! buy the album! you won't regret it!"
3,More grown up than the first...,"The second album from O-Town is a bit more grown up than the first...more moody and with really great songs. The standout songs on this album for me are ""From The Damage"", ""Over Easy"", ""Favorite Girl"", ""Craving"", ""You Can't Lose Me"", and ""These Are The Days"". These songs show more emotion and range. The rest of the songs are either bad or not as good as they could have been (""Make Her Say"" and ""I Only Dance With You""). I honestly can't really listen to the rest of the album. But it's still a good album. Those 6 songs were enough for me."
2,disapointment,"O-Town's first album was great,the lyrics were good and so was the music.On this album they tried to do an alternative rock thing,it sucks.Alternative rock and boy bands don't go together!But I do like one song from this album ""I only dance with you"",the george micheal remake."
2,Too Quaint and Wordy...,"I could not get into Dylan's quaint, cumbersome ways of writing. The poetic idol of the 50's tavern and pub culture falls in the classic Welsh trap - loving the sound of his own words too much and completely forgetting where or why his 'tale' is headed.I liked best the deceptively ironic title."
5,Great gift,Got this belly ring for my wife who recently had her navel repierced. It was perfect for her to sport round our hometown of Miami. She loved it and I loved it on her.
3,"Good plane, bad controls","I didnt even attempt to fly the B29 with the factory controls, knowing they were marginal at best. I installed a spred spectrum control system with servos for ailerons, elevator and nose wheel, and of course - lipo batteries. It is an excellent flyer, takeoffs are realistic. Been flying it for 2 years, still good. See it on youtube, name TWINTEN.[...]"
1,No flyer here,"I spent about 3 hours assembling this plane. The parts provided for engine harness were of poor quality. Also, tight fit between engine harness and fuselage not possible. The wings and tail constructed of flimsy foam. On remote controller, when I attempted to extend the antennae 1st time, top portion bent and broke. On 1st fly, plane crashed and fuselage cracked. I taped the fuselage and wing areas. On subsequent attempts to fly the plane, realized that the remote connection was not consistent. The engines were intermittent after the plane went beyond the immediate range of the antennae (about 1 FT). Obviously, some improvements on this plane's design and remote controller are in order."
5,typical Clive Cussler book,"Clive Cussler seldom dissapoints me, this is typical Cussler good guys against the bad -high tech stuff on both sides , but of course the good guys have better stuff and are ultimately smarter, it's a fun read as always"
3,Hate to say it but I think Cussler and his cohorts have run out of different things to write about...,Just seemed to me like a rehash off a couple old books mixed together with a little more unneccessary discriptive gore thrown in.
5,"Amazing Book, Clive is Back, the Oregon is Back","I loved this book because it got back to what I loved about the Oregon Files in the first place. It has all the aspects of a swashbuckling pirate novel, set in the modern day. Well developed characters and amazing an a believable story line with not too much of the flair and fantasy."
4,I always enjoy his books.,Great as usual. Makes the impossible seem more possible. He has a very impressive imagination. I look forward to the next one.
2,too bad re-release,Should know better and look at the publish date. Read this one years ago. Someone needs to list publishing date instead of making it look like a new release.
2,Good guys always win - Unlimited resources equals no real challenges to them,"I didn't finish this book.This is the 4th book in this series that I have read and it dawned on me that all these books are very very similiar. And it's just not that the same characters are involved, the ship is the same etc etc.With unlimited money, state of beyond the art technology, contacts with everyone in power throughout the world and the world's best luck the drama that I experienced in the first few books just isn't there anymore as I know they will prevail in the end.So I'd recommend picking iup a couple of books ion this series but then move on.Exciting for the first few books, but then repetitive, other than the antagonist, each book thereafter"
3,just so-so for Cussler,Did not feel that this book was really up to speed for a Cussler novel. Almost as if he was not involved with it. Have been an avid reader of Cussler novels for many years.
5,great story,cussler's Oregon Files has always been a favorate and this disc collection tells the whole story and not just the important parts
2,Boring for an Oregon Files story,I have read almost all of the Clive Cussler books and have enjoyed the Oregon Files series until now. The plot had the potential to be a good read but Clive and Jack let me down on this one.
4,good book,I have read all of Clive Cussler's fictional works and I have enjoyed them all very much. you should read them
5,Another part of a winning series,"The Oregon files is one of my favorites in Clive Cussler's library. Reading this in 2012, the 2005 publishing date shows in some changes in the world order that have changed, but that does not diminish it as an enjoying read."
2,Dark Watch:A Dud,"As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.This book just didn't have the ""zing"" of the older Cussler stories.If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read."
5,Excellent book,"Thoroughly enjoyed by my family and me. Great pace, plausible plots, superbly written action sequences, enthusiastic '2 thumbs up'!"
4,Cussler never ceases to amaze,"Thumbs up for Cussler again..! I usually read Dirk Pitt novels and this was the first time I've read another files series by Cussler and it was worth it. However, there's one thing that I would like to point out. Like many people around the world, the book assumes Sikhs are Muslims (Shere Singh calls out to Allah and also his second eldest son's name is Mohamed who is the prophet of Muslims). Sikhs do not follow the Islamic religion and their faith is known as Sikhism. It is a blend of Hinduism and Islam. Although Sikhs believe in one God as Muslims do, they do not believe this one God is Allah."
3,"De-focused onto two plots, not Cussler's best effort",Dark Watch by Clive Cussler was not as interesting as his other works. This abridged audio book was the story of modern day pirates who take not only the cargo of a captured ship but they also take the ship itself. Throw in some international slave traders and you have what seems like two books going at the same time with only minimal interactions.The book would have been better if it focused on one story and then developed it in greater detail. I am still a big fan of Cussler. This one is not his best work.
4,Captains views on Dark Watch,This Oregon Files book lives up to my expectations from Clive Cussler.Fast Paced action mixed with a little bit of his quirky humor. Easy to read and immerse yourself in this fictional corporation so you can ride along with the crew on their missions.
5,Great Bag!,"This is an awesome bag with plenty of room for clubs and even an extra compartment in the front for your shoes. It does come with keys, but I would upgrade to the Masterlock version for peace of mind."
4,A bit less than I expected,"Oh, how we love Harry Potter and our action figures (in general) in this house with two young boys! These figures have great likeness to their characters, but are a bit smaller than we expected. The wands broke off the first day. We love them, though, and are glad to have them."
4,nice figures,"These are great figures, if you don't mind that they do not move. Still very enjoyable as figures. Mind the tiny wands, though!"
2,"Poor production, marketing pictures are misleading","I bought these action figures recently as a holiday present for a loved one. When I opened the box (they are all wrapped individually) I was really, really disappointed. The picture representation of the figures do not accurately depict how the figures were made. Harry looks the worst, with his glasses horribly produced and stuck to his face in an awkward way.I'm hesitant to even give this figure set as a gift considering how awful they look!"
2,Really pretty much a mess,"Wallace is very much a hit-or-miss kind of writer. This is more miss than hit: a real slumgullion of a plot, it involves a greedy industrialist who's afraid of his life, a love triangle, a strange man who does weird experiments and seems to run around in the slums in disguise, old enemies resurfacing, a mysterious murder, and a man who's an early stab at an ""information aggregator"", of all people, in the Sherlock Holmes role. Nothing here really coalesces, this is not a very strongly plotted book for all of the things ""that happen"", as is often the case with Wallace's weaker efforts it feels like a drunken story that more peters out than finishes. Plaudits for the final reveal, though, which is genuinely surprising and which indicates how brilliant Wallace could really be at this sort of thing, when he was trying."
4,Lots of crimes in this one,"The Man who Knew is packed full of murders, fraud, blackmail and past misdeeds in Rhodesia.The Man who Knew is a man who has information on literally everyone. It's interesting watching him work - and pay close attention at the end. Constable Wiseman is a local policeman, has his suspect and doggedly sticks to him.This is a fun read and not too long (2,390 locations). Definitely worth getting if you like late 19th Century, early 20th Century mysteries."
1,Poverty Row and awful,i am always interested in Anna May Wong and bought this for her presence. The sets acting and writing are bottom of the barrel. if this is the best that wong could act the limits on her career werenn't all racial. Skip this
3,Impressive range of diverse classic rock and more,"3 1/2Around the same time their British companions played gently with a particular brand of folk rock, this American band of the same name released a more impressive rock album with a far more diverse slant. Expertly navigating many different musical cultures from Irish to Indian and back home again, this modest release matches the band's moniker far more effectively then their buddies from across the pond. Although these worldly recordings may be looked upon as glorified samplers more then authentic replications, the playing and production remains adept enough to engage even cynical listeners."
4,Kaleidoscope were brilliant,"Brilliant musicians who wrote and recorded brilliant songs. They could be psychedelic, country, straight rock, Middle Eastern Eastern European, or even pop. Cool vocals, amazing musicianship, and quality songwriting and cover choices made for fantastic albums. And the title track is among the great extended psych tracks I've ever heard. David Lindley and company were the real deal."
3,"Winwood's ""Band On The Run""","Recorded on hiatus with Remi Kabaka and Abdul Lasisi Amao between Traffic's ""Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory,"" and ""When The Eagle Flies,"" ""Aiye-Keta"" is a vital component for any Traffic or Steve Winwood CD collection. It's loose, chiefly instrumental, and a refreshing break from the confines of stardom."
1,Mistaken Order,"We ordered ""The Best of Eva Cassidy"" by mistake. We thought we were ordering a music CD, but we were really ordering sheet music. I guess we didn't read the fine print. This item was listed with the CD's, so we made an erroneous assumption.Eva Cassidy is one of our favorite singers, and this item would probably rate five stars for somebody who reads music.Thank you for the opportunity to comment."
4,great entertainment and educational,"We received this as a gift for my son who is now 2 1/2. He started playing with it around 18 months and was so interested in seeing how it all stacks together. It is entertaining enough for him that he will consistently bring it out of the toy box to try to stack. Over the months, he's gone from just fiddling with the individual pieces to nearly completely the stack himself. It's not as easy as you would think, even for an adult, as it does require your attention, yet it's got enough ""room"" for alternate places to put the little pieces, as opposed to what's shown on the box. The design is fun and funky, and it's definitely not a typical toy you'd see at the local toy stores. All the more reason to pick one up!"
1,I don't think so!,"I was looking for books about straight spouses who have unwittingly married gays and came across this book.I don't usually like to criticise other people but I have to say that telling people God told a straight spouse to stay with a gay spouse is misguided at best. There is no doubt at all that God would not approve of any marriage built on such lies.The author has decided to stay for her own reasons, but she cannot justly claim that God directed her to live such a marriage.I, for one, will never read this book."
4,When Will We Get A Watchable Concert Video From Them,"This is one of my favorite bands. I had the Scenes from the big chair on VHS and I'm glad to see it got the DVD treatment. Very interesting and informative video of the bands early years with videos and concert footage thrown in.The Going to California concert is another story. Just like the In my minds eye concert, this too is almost unwatchable. With Minds eye it was like the editor just got a new video effects machine and wanted to use every single effect on it. With this concert, once again we are subject to constant video effects, switching from color to black and white. Then to grainy footage again in both color and black and white with grainy video footage thrown in. You really can't enjoy the show with the video constantly changing all the time."
4,Depraved Indifference to Decency (but fun),"These guys have a twisted sense of humor but they are lots of fun. Nothing is sacred and anyone can have his ox gored. They try to be thorough and get everyone and do low with the lowest brow humor they can come up with. The result is often hilarious.Bob & Tom do not just rely on themselves. They have plenty of guests doing comedy bits and they have an outstanding staff to provide their own parodies. The production values of some of their parodies is surprisingly good.If you have a thin skin, you had best keep away. Otherwise, give them a try."
5,From the Publisher,"""Greeting cards by Sergio Cruz . . . 12 full-color 4 3/4 x 4 3/4"" square blank greeting cards with envelopes and decorative box. Square cards require additional postage.""-- Pomegranate"
1,LOUSY waste of time and money!,"Product did not work - recipient was, if anything, over-qualified to assemble but it didn't work one second. What a bust!"
5,Even a clip show deserves credit....,"This dvd features one of the greatest fights in the series (personal favorite)but you only get 4 episodes because the first one is just a clip show but let me tell ya even the clip show is awsome, sure its a recap of all that we all well know but what makes it great for me has to be the music played out trough the whole episode and dvd. It's really a great series and even a clip show deserves credit...^_^"
3,Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Vol. 6,"DVD Numero Six. The series is in full swing. Nothing particularly interesting but do please note that episode Episode 26 is just a clip show, just a recap (They probably ran out of Ideas) so they decided also to run T.M. Revolution lead singer Takanori Nishikawa's newest music into the ground, so that will be several points against the DVD, since you really only get 4 episodes. The episodes included are as follows:Phase 26: Moment (The clip show)Phase 27: Endless RondoPhase 28: KiraPhase 29: Turning PointPhase 30: Flashing BladesHence, If you've read my previous reviews, you know who I reccomend this to: Sci Fi, Anime or Gundam fans, but this DVD may not REALLY be worth your money, since you only get 4 episodes, but hey, they have some "" TV historical"" value.."
3,Not exactly the best!!,"This particular ""best of"" is a tad misleading in its title.Roughly half the tracks are run throughs and not much better in quality than those found on the ""Unchained"" series.The companion to this, ""Volume Two"" does give the buyer finished master tracks, and is therefore a better proposition. It also gives a better overview of all the T.Rex Wax Company singles and better cuts Marc Bolan gave us up until his demise in 1977."
2,Fact or fiction?,"I question how much of this book really happened. I'm sure there was a relationship between the author and Jane, and I don't doubt Jane took advantage of their friendship. Still, I find it difficult to believe the author was so mesmerized that she gave Jane complete control of her life. She is a seemingly intelligent woman with a supportive family - why did she stay? She had plenty of opportunities to leave Jane, but stayed way too long. I would like to hear Jane's side of the story."
5,A Page Turner. I have read it several times.,"As a clinician, I have a special interest in Borderline Personality Disorder. I have worked with many of these patients and have read multiple books on the subject. Caroline Kraus' book is the only one I have read that is as on target as it can get and still be interesting and entertaining. Ms. Kraus takes us on a fascinating and well written trip through the spiraling life of a woman who meets and falls in love with a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder. This is a very accurate account of what life can be like with someone with this disorder. It's also interesting to learn how a ""normal"" person can unknowingly fall into the trap of attraction to a BPD. A wonderful read. I sure wish Caroline Kraus would write another book of this type. She has a gift."
5,Excellent writing,"As a writer, discovering this book makes me sad. Why? Because it's so well written I wished the author were better known, or had won awards or something. Brilliant writing is sustained throughout the book, which covers territory that I have yet to see covered in the modern memoir. Can't wait to read more from this author."
2,very disappointed,"I bought this over the summer, and as an ecologist and bird enthusiest, I wanted a good pair of binoculars with a camera built in so I can capture good shots of birds in their natural habitat. The magnification was pretty good, I could see things from a pretty far distance. However, every single one of my pictures that I took were very blurry. Being that its almost impossible to stand perfectly still or to NOT shake or move at all, these are not functional camera binoculars if you cant get a clear picture. Especially when you'rein the field and want to get a quick shot. The only way to get a clear shot is to put it on a tripod, and thats too much trouble and not possible when out in the field and you come across a great photo opportunity. By the time you set up everything, its too late! More thought needs to be put into these products before manufacturing them."
2,Meh.,"I dunno, the story was definitely ""weird"" and that's what was promised. As for storytelling itself though, I felt the author left too much out. I could tell the author knew his characters. Unfortunately I did not; I was left hanging when, after completing the first read-through, there was no ultimate delivery. I never felt like I had any sort of real grasp of any character. While I do not mind this while reading (for example, Catch-22 is a great book for re-reading as I learn the characters more completely each time), I do appreciate more detail into the characterizations. I may be beating around the bush here... While I enjoy books that make me an active part of the story (Palahniuk, for example, requiring an active participant in the audience), I do not enjoy when I have to do 50% or more of the detail within my own imagination. This book did not fulfill my needs in supplementing the plot. It was flat and, to be honest, boring."
5,An excellent satire about our society's nee for spectacles and useless consumer goods,I loved it. One of the weirdest novels I've ever read. Sakowski picks apart everything we are taught to believe and reveals the silliness of it all. Through a surreal lenses he catalogues everything that is entailed in being human. He goes against the modern novel format and creates an evocative anti-novel. I'm going to seek out everything he wrote.
1,Like Books Without Plots & Dull Characters Without Names?,"Awful. Save your money. Honestly THE WORST book I've ever had the misfortune to trust amazon-ians to talk me into reading! I couldn't tell you what that books about and I just finished it. There was no plot to the story; no purpose behind any activity the ""characters"" went thru; even the bizarre happenings were left unexplained and contained no metaphors. Basically it's just ramblings with the same people popping up again and again. I was hoping for surrealism with a good story behind it. If that's what you're looking for too, look away from here. These reviewers who love this book must be VERY easily amused... or just like the breasts on the cover. P.S. - There aren't even naked womyn in the book... nor nurses. It's a simple marketing ploy for simple minds. So is the book."
4,Little Dynamo,"At first I was hesitant to purchase this product, not being sure if it could handle a heavy amount of embossing, considering it seemed so small and ""non-techy"". It did everything I needed it to do which was to create over 100 labels in one sitting. You'll need to press down evenly and firmly using both hands, (pressing down on the two ""thumb"" placements on the handle). Using one thumb will cause an uneven, light impression."
2,poor hand grip,The handle that you grip is too shallow and does not allow you to get a firm grip to press hard enough for a dark print to be made. The result is a label with partially faded embossing.
4,Environmentalist propaganda,"This is environmentalist propaganda, which I see as a good thing. It takes views from Native Americans (who are of course very in touch with the Earth) and makes the argument that we must DO SOMETHING to keep from destroying ourselves. We will be our own undoing if we don't take care of our planet."
4,The End is Relative,Less about the end of the earth than what we should be doing to appreciate it. This well-conceptualized documentary blends Native American and environmentalist sensibilities to give a sobering but real look at the evolution and possible future of our planet.
2,Well,"This cd would be good if you had like a small collection of cd's. I, on the other hand, have a ton of cd's and I have most of the cd's of the bands that are on this cd. So if you r a huge fanatic of christian music(like me) and have a ton of christian music cds(like me) then I wouldn't suggest you in buying it. If you are just getting into christian music, and want to know what bands sound good, then this cd would be perfect for you."
4,Very Good,"I am an SAP consultant with over 4 years of ABAP consulting experience. I ordered this book long before it went into print. So, I could not wait for it to read when it finally arrived! The authors have covered advanced ABAP features in a simple way with lot of illustrations and examples. This book has saved me a lot of time as how to exploit the ABAP workbench to its maximum potential."
5,Hitting the nail,"This biography is the first I've read of a man I've had the privilege to know. It's also the first review on Amazon I've felt compelled to write. I applaud Worthen's ability to peg Charlie Hill. Her characterizations are 100% in my experience of man who has lived a compelling life. I recommend this book to all students of foreign policy.Yes, you can marvel at the fact that a professor buys coffee at Starbucks. I feel sorry for those who've forgotten that."
5,Great sounding strings with the added bonus of color,"These strings were reccomended to me by an acquaintance of mine during a bass clinic I attended recently. I ordered them right away.. All i can say is WOW! Excellent tone. It really brightened up my sound. I had gotten used to muddy sounding strings. I havent noticed a sticky feeling like others have mentioned, mine are silky smooth. Great playability. Was'nt too concerned about color, But When I installed them on my Ferrari red Carvin LB 70, I fell in love with my bass all over again. It looks stunning, and I get many comments about my bass now..Others have mentioned that the color wears off quickly, but I don't care, I'll used the color wear as a guage of when to change them..Then neon ones even glow brightly under a black light. Bass players don't get much credit so why not give them a show and something to talk about."
5,Arts and Crafts,Maybe I missed the grout color in the details of the product but I was ecstatic to see that the grout is white instead of grey. I am using this grout for a sea glass project and it really makes the colors of the sea glass stand out. I doubt this information helps customers who are doing home improvements but this product has worked great for my project.
4,It's sex grease,"This product was just like it's name Sex Grease. I have order it a while back but I if I can remember clearly, it was a awsome experience."
3,Not for self-sex,"This looked really good and closer to the type of organic/natural product I like than usual lubes. So I tried it. Good for sex...yes...but only with someone else. I tried it for some self-pleasure and it got REALLY sticky and REALLY gooey on it's own. I use it with some lotion, it's ok. And I'll definitely recommend this for two+ sex occasions...but not for self-lovin' time!"
3,Mass-Market Krishnamurti,"This is another collection of short pieces that doesn't do Krishnamurti's teachings justice. To fully grasp & enjoy his teachings, you must go into each & every subject slowly & carefully, as he himself states in many different works. The pieces here are too short, & Krishnamurti's vocabulary & philosophy aren't fully explained. If you've read several of his other works, & are familiar with his vocabularu & philosophy, then this is a fairly decent book. If you're not, this isn't a good place to start."
3,Balancing The Art & Science of Nude Photography,"My shipment of books arrived to great anticipation because after 15 years of shooting professional travel photography I wanted some reference books to help provide inspiration for photographing nudes. Of the five I ordered, unfortunately, this book left me wanting more. While going into detail about lighting, posing and technique, once you've seen a few pages you've got the entire book. First, know that it's entirely in B&W--not bad for nude photography, except Mr Lemon notes that many of the images were originally shot in color. Also if you eventually want to sell your images you need to shoot color. If you're new to using flash or don't understand basic lighting concepts this book could help, but advanced amateurs and pros will bore quickly."
4,Grindcore + 80s electro?,"Sounds like a bit of a joke doesn't it? A bit of a gimmick. I wondor who's idea in the band it was to mix melodic electro/space-rock with extreme metal and melodic shredding but whoever it was I applaud them. Not only is this a hybrid of different styles, its also a hybrid of two different approaches to songwriting - making serious and melodic music and making fun, catchy and quirky music. Cloak Of Love really is a great little EP. Its only 12 minutes long, but those 12 minutes are so good you'll find yourself listening to it two or three times in a row. If you want something a little different that doesn't sound like its trying too hard to be different, I suggest picking it up."
4,Really great book,"Among all books on renovations I purchased this Fall, this one is my favorite. The photography is outstanding, the text really insightful. While I didn't really find how-tos, the What the pros Know tips put me on the right track while contemplating my own renovation. I highly recommend it!"
2,Broken Four times,"I have had this TV for about 2 years now, after about 6 months the tv just shut off, so i turned it back on it then again shut off and eventually would not turn on. I called Toshiba and they had me bring it to get repaired after doing so the tv worked for about 2 weeks. I called Toshiba agian and then had me bring it back to get repaired. This time the TV worked for a couple months then died again. I was then given the option to send it back in exchange for a new TV. I thought this would be a solution but this TV has now stoped working. I just got off the phone with Toshiba and they want me to get it repaired again. I hate this tv the one i have had for 15 years works better. TV shouldn't break. and this one has 4 times."
3,He looks heroic,"This version of Capt. Atom looks more authentic than, for instance, [...] but his face appears to be exactly the same as the Superman figure's. So that's a bit disappointing."
3,I give it a thumbs-up (slowly but surely).,"This book was definitely well-written, but some of the parts in this book were too discriptive and drawn-out. I thought that it was very informative as to the life of Audrey Hepburn and it explains everything well. As I said before, it should have been shorter, so that the reader would want to turn each page and be very interested in everything read."
4,Traveler Pinpoint Solid Buttondown Collar Dress Shirt Big or Tall,"Holy cow batman are these long! I often have trouble finding shirts long enough in the arm length so I thought I'd give these a try. They are heavy weight and good looking but I have not been able to wear them yet b/c I need to take them to a tailor to remove about 5-6"" off the bottom. I'm 6'1 with a heavy build so unless your 6'4 or taller these aren't for you."
4,"Next Year Will Be Better, we hope","This is a book full of the practical side of life in Africa, especially in a farming community, which was what most of the then Rhodesia consisted. Written from a woman's point of view, it is a refreshing read, especially for one Rhodesian born & gives an insight on what people of that time did in their day to day lives. It also gives you the maxim by which they lived & so many do still in Zimbabwe, always hoping that ""next year will be better"", which given the present government, isn't very hopeful at all."
2,did not last 6 months,"I bought the hd- 20 toshiba hddvd player the 1st week of sept. 07, did not use it much at first because I did not have many hd dvd's, very expensive. about 3 weeks ago it started not sending a video signal to my t.v. about every 5th time I used it. I would have to unplug the unit and replug to get it to send a signal to my t.v. at this point I have sent it back to toshiba for repair, the freight is my expense to get it there. who knows how this will turn out."
3,HD-A20,"Good player. I've had no real problems, and the video and audio quality are great. I wish the load time was faster."
2,dissapointed!!,"Did everyone get the same player that I did??First of all, the Toshiba A20 HD-DVD cannot play all of the new HD discs available on the market so you have to get an upgrade over the internet using a download onto a CD-RW (which did not work for me). I called Toshiba service center and they said that they would send me an upgrade disc, however, to this day it is back ordered. My first player, the add-on HD player for XBOX360 plays all of the discs on the market. So why not a supposedly better player like the A20?I give this product 2 stars because I am generous!I would like to know if anyone else has run into these problems."
1,Inoperative HD Player,"One month after purchase, this unit still does not function on regular or HD discs! Toshiba should automatically provide necessary updates for purchasers as soon as the updates are completed without the owner's request! I notified Toshiba by USPS and email that I lived in an area without broadband computer coverage and required that updates be mailed to me and that my unit would not operate three weeks ago! A subsequent call to Toshiba after three weeks disclosed that my update had been cancelled internally, reason unknown! Toshiba needs to improve their consumer services!"
1,Broke after 1 week,Worked well at first until auido dropped out completely after 1 week. Audio would not work with any hd or regular disk. Very dissappointed and returned to Amazon. Will probably wait till kinks are out of these players.
5,Wow.,"I may never watch ""regular"" TV again. This product delivers the goods, with an amazing 1080p picture on my Samsung HL-S5687W 56"" 1080p DLP HDTV and a super duper easy setup right out of the box. Highly recommended."
5,Outstanding Unit,"I have owned this player since May and i am exremely happy with it. Set up was a piece of cake..picture quality blew away those compressed Hd chanels on satellite. Sound is superior to DVD. Standard DVD upconversion exceeded my expectations( colors seem bolder,smoother film-like picture,less picture noise) My only complaint about this player is the slow loading times and flimsy remote. I strongly recomend this unit to anyone who owns an hdtv. Those 5 free HD DVD's arrived in about 7 weeks."
4,Quality issues?,"I've only been using this player for a few days. And I've never used another HD DVD player before so I don't have anything to compare this to. But the first day I started to use it, I've already had a problem with the drive bay door not completely closing. I live overseas and used this for the first time when I'd already left the country so I basically can't return this unit. I'm hoping the door problem is an aberation. But this whole thing makes me more than a little concerned about the overall quality of it.Other than the door, the unit seems to work okay. I don't like the long start up times, but I've heard it's not as bad as some of the other options. Picture quality is fantastic, but as I mentioned, I don't have anything else to compare to."
5,Awesome!,"Incredible picture and sound. My only complaint is the load times, but its a small price to pay for the picture and sound quality. Once you've seen 1080p on a Sony XBR2 LCD you will never want to watch regular DVDs again!"
2,there is nothing else out there but it is very limited,"1) it is not dual voltage , it only works in the US _ what if........2) it does not play many dvd-s created with computer programs it does not play PAL dvd-sin outher words if you stay put buy what they sell you (and wth the price want to subsidize the fossilized recording and film industry) and have to buy one , buy it3) for me it only worked with s-video with most lcd and plazma screens i tried."
1,DO NOT BUY,Do not buy any Toshiba HD DVD players. Press releases state that they are no longer in the HD DVD business. They have quit making them.
1,what???,"I think i'm confused. I recently purchased this product in order to fully showcase my new samsung 1080p tv. with such great reviews i was looking forward to the product. when i opened the box, i discovered that the toshiba HD DVD player only came with an RCA cable!!!!!! what a JOKE! wow, i guess paying $300+ for an HD DVD player only gets you RCA cables. i had to go out and buy a $30 HDMI cable in order to get the HD benefit. what a joke. that totally rubbed me the wrong way that i will only give this product 1 star. the picture is good and the features are nice, but an RCA CABLE, come on! what a slap in the face."
1,Disappointing,"I had the same experience as the previous poster. The belt is too thin to work with my buckle. I'll use the belts I got, but I won't buy from these folks again."
1,A Belt That Does NOT hold your pants up.,"I had a genuine web belt like this in the army, it worked like a charm, and stuck in my mind for years as being a great belt. I ordered this one and found out very quickly that the canvas belt is not thick enough for the buckle to grip. It simply does not work. You put in and tighten it and it just comes loose. Get a real one, not this chinese copy."
2,"Cheap, but some how entertaining","As most people say, this is obviously a Sy-fy original movie so it will be very mediocre. However, the cheap special effects still give me a good laugh and make the movie entertaining. You know you have found an enjoyable movie when you can talk about it for a while afterwards, whether good or bad."
2,Early Alice!!!!,"This contains early Alice Cooper tracks and frankly it isn't great but it is worth having not for any songs particularily but it is the beginning of an American institution Alice Cooper, plus trust me Alice goes on to bigger and better things. This is one only for the diehards so if you are new to Alice buy something else."
3,Food for Thought for a study of the Mexican War,"Interesting. The first article, though, on Polk's New England tour, was dull and pointless. Wayne Cutler makes his point long before he ends the article. The best article was Miguel Soto's on the Monarchist's conspiracy in Mexico. Soto's work is probably an essential piece to a study on the politics of Mexico during the conflict. John Eisenhower also gives a interesting look into the relationships of Polk, Scott, and Taylor. However, even this article is lacking. Soto's article is the only purely essential piece. The others are just food for thought."
3,"Decent, cheap gloves","Good grip, nice and cool for hot days. The backing was too stretchy, so when hard passes come in, the palm sticky part sticks to the ball and the glove rotates on your hand. You end up with the slippery spandex backing on your palm making it hard to hang on to the ball after the catch.Other than that, a very good, light glove for summertime catches. Typical Under Armor super sticky palms for the first few games. After that they wear fast."
1,Very angry.,These stupid gloves ripped the second time i put them on my hands. I would only recommend then to someone who feels like wasting 30 bucks.
4,One minor flaw -- otherwise excellent,"This was the first CJ album I had purchased, and it has led me to purchase just about everything they've recorded. It definitely has a fuller, more commercial sound than their other albums. Margo Timmins' voice is extraordinary regardless of the material. She could sing ANYTHING and it would be interesting. The one dud is ""Someone Out There,"" in which the supreme being is referred to by the big ""f"" word in the unedited version and by what sounds like ""booger"" or ""bugger"" or something in the edited version. Anyway, it's a song which is certainly not unlistenable but is unworthy of the CJ. I'd probably just buy the unedited version -- the ""f"" word is probably less bothersome than whatever she's mumbling in its place. The rest of the album is excellent."
1,Depressing Album,"This album has little inspiration. The cowboy junkies sound to me like they're not having any fun at all. Since the group is called Cowboy Junkies I guess it makes sense that they produced on this album junk. And what on earth is that line in the song that says: ""who gave this power to that f#cker up there."" I hope they're not talking about the lord."
2,love their CD's but not this one,"They went for an obvious Pop sound on this one and I gave it away to anyone who would take it after trying for six months to like it. Every track sounds over-produced. Margo's voice track is often hidden under a lot of studio production. Really, it is dreck. Buy ""Lay it Down"" which is amazing. They lost me on this one."
3,Doesn't Really Live Up To Their Talent.,"After the amazing ""Lay It Down"" CD, I was really hoping that this would be a continuation of that. Sadly, it isn't. While there are good tracks,(Blue Guitar, Miles From Our Home) it doesn't have that powerful punch that previous CD's of theirs have. Margo Timmons is a wonderful songstress and she's what holds the band together. This time she doesn't even have enough talent for that. Sadly...this CD doesn't really hit the mark."
4,Splendid!,"Not my favorite, but it grows on me every time I hear it. My faves are Darkling Days , No Birds Today and Summer of Discontent. Dunno what's the big hullaballoo about Someone Out There. Did anyone wonder if ""that F-er out there"" might refer to a televangelist--someone entirely deserving of that derogatory label... I'm seeing them in concert tomorrow night. Can't wait..."
2,Where have all the Cowboys gone?,"What a dissapointment! It seems that under the guise of ""innovation"" or ""experimentation"" the Cowboy Junkies have made their lucrative move towards the mainstream. Margo's breathtaking voice has been demoted almost to the background behind her brother's guitar. Goodbye to the clear, stunning vocals. Goodbye, also, to Michael's poetic lyrics. The songs on this CD are basic and boring, without any of the poetry and STORIES of the past. Are the Junkies following a Misguided Angel? If you're a Cowboy Junkies fan, you better listen to this one before buying it."
2,Blues-less Cowboys,"IMHO, this Junkies' album, more than any other, makes us pay attention to the musicality of the songs more than the lyrics. I think that was one of the ideas behind this album, as it was intended to break from the sparse arrangements of albums past and have a much more polished sound to it. Unfortunately, I don't think it works with the exception of ""New Dawn Coming"" and possibly ""Hollow as a Bone"". What's missing is the blues, the backbone of the Junkies' sound. Without it, the melody of each track stands out more, and we are left with fairly lackluster music. Some of songs start off well enough, but then fail to develop, musically, as the song progresses. ""Miles from our Home"" and ""The Summer of Discontent"" are prime examples of this.Try ""Lay it Down"", ""Black Eyed Man"", or ""Trinity Sessions"" before this one."
2,Miles from the expected...,Extremely disappointing...this CD is miles from what is expected from the Cowboy Junkies.
3,OPUS SEVEN,"After the flamboyant LAY IT DOWN, everybody was expecting another masterpiece from the Cowboy Junkies. Recorded between january 1997 and january 1998, MILES FROM OUR HOME was a complete surprise for the CJ fans. One will hardly find in the CD the campfire mood so present in the first six records of the canadian band. An electric wall seems have been built by Michal Timmins on each song with the exception of "" someone outh there "". Margo Timmins's voice is often lost behind this wall of sound and doesn't trouble us the way it once did.But melodies and words are nevertheless of great qualities. Be aware that an eleventh song "" at the end of the rainbow "" is hidden at the end of the CD, you have to let you CD-player run during about thirty seconds after the last song announced ( "" those final feet "" ) in order to listen to that song.A CD reserved to CJ's faithful fans."
3,"An OK CD, but furthest from their original sound.","I really miss the feel of the music from their earlier years. ""The Trinity Session"" and ""The Caution Horses"" are beautifully done. Can never tire from those melodies and lyrics.This CD seems to be the furthest from their eariler sound which really stuck me. Miss the original ""smaller"" band with more focus on a ""simpler"" and purer sound."
3,I don't get it.,"Did they ""get religion""? This album confused me. while it sounded good, I was a bit taken aback by a lot of references to ""have you been saved""."
1,COWBOY JUNKIES MILES FROM HOME AND LOST.,"Being a devoted Junkies fan and anxoiusly awaiting their new cd all I can say is I feel lost. Miles From Our Home is such an apt descrption of where the junkies have gone. Gone are the days of hearing a truely unique sound: clear vocals, poetic lyrics, and oh that voice of Margo's. And replaced with what? Margo's voice being muted by grating guitar backgrounds, and melodies that can only be discribed as boring. If this is the result of growth or experimentation it was a great step backwards, no backwards is exactly where this group needs to go. For those who are new to this group check out their earlier cd's and hear true genius. They had their niche, there was no one else to compete against them. With this cd they have thrown that away and joined the mainstream, a mainstream that is littered with groups with this sound. Too bad."
2,Just too poppish for me,"I love the Junkies: I don't care for pop. This album is a foray into a pure pop sound--very disappointing. I would highly recommend finding a way to preview this album before purchasing it, especially if you have been hypnotized by the Trinity Sessions. I consider myself flexible, but the turn of style ranks in betrayal right up there with Elvis Costello's Burt Bacharach fiasco."
3,CJ know better than that,"I would agree with the reviews that characterize CJ's latest record too mainstream. Indeed they've been heading that way already on the previous one or two records. There are just but echoes of the old Junkies left on ""Miles from Our Home"", most evidently in ""Blue Guitar"". I'm not saying this is bad music, but a lot of the irresistible charm of ""The Trinity Session"" or ""The Caution Horses"" got lost somewhere along the way."
3,"Movie OK, Sal and Beet BEST","Movie is what it is. Sal and Beet are why I watched it...ok...and the boobage! Hope this leads to more for Sal! He is a very good actor on the Howard Stern Show! Beet is my favorite wack-packer, and Sal is my favorite regular staff member...for me it is great to see them team up! I watched to just see them in it, and it was worth it!"
1,C - R - A - P !!!,"This must be one the the crapiest, stupid dumb movie I've seen in decades.Story is soooo boring... no plot, no acting, nothing worth your time.This sucks big time... pass on...really."
1,Trailer Seemed Funny...,"But we didn't laugh at all during at least the half of it we watched. Seriously, this film sucks, and only 1 of the 6 girls was at all attractive. Skinny, stereotypical brain dead cheerleaders."
5,"Montgomery ""Monk"" Keybutter?!","All i have to say is Montgomery ""Monk"" Keybutter has one hell of a pendulum swing. (pay close attention to his form on the putting green (SPOILER ALERT) ) Also Hammer Smash is an instant hit and should be recorded for iTunes purposes."
4,Solid Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I didn't expect much from this movie when I purchased it. The IMDB Movie Review Scale Gives it a 3.50 out of 10.00, meaning only 3 out of every 10 people give it a possible review...Yikes! lol I knew I was taking a gamble when I purchased it but to my suprise it was actually pretty good. You have a decent set of Actors, some familiar some new. You have the Cameo of Ron Jeremy as well. The plot was a little easy to follow, and I don't know if there was a Hidden message behind the movie with all of its religous pointers and references...but who knows. You can't expect much more from a Low Budget B film. IN other words, for a Film within its Genre, and Budget. It did pretty darn well!!!!"
4,About what I expected,This movie was pretty good. Pretty much what I expected. It's a little corny and fairly low budget but I thought the acting was actually pretty good and its entertaining. I took off one star only because I thought they could have had a little bit hotter girls. Theyre attractive but one has implants (which I'm not a fan of) and the others have decent bodies but nothing special.
3,Schlock Gone Good,"I'm a fan of campy horror movies. They're my favorite to watch. GIRLS GONE DEAD is up there with SCARECROW movies. Terrible trash that' just really fun to zone out to. Another good one that I found wasRoadside Massacre, it's just as cheap looking but is also very good (and very funny) for what it is, and for those sharp enough to catch the 70s/80s references. Indie horror flicks are still my favorite, even if my wife cannot stand them!"
2,Girls Gone Unfunny,"Don't believe the hype about this movie. They wasted the talents of Jerry Lawler and others. There is plenty of T&A; in this movie but the nudity just don't cut it. None of the gals are really that hot not that I wanted all of them to be but it is like they almost wanted to turn you off with the nudity. I have to give the movie credit as it was well lit and the sound was perfect but unfortunately the dialogue got boring and annoying. The humor was out of sync. I mean if you want to watch a really bad movie with nudity thrown in and gore go for it but I laughed all the way throughPiranha DDcompared to having fast forward parts of this trash. I found it totaly unfunny and annoying. I say avoid, the nudity isn't worth it and I found no laughs not even at the bad acting or dialogue."
1,Extremely old and boring - Don't buy!!,"Don't buy this! I recently purchased this set, thank god I didn't pay full price! The videos have some real footage that makes you think about your own life, but most of the footage appears to be staged and is extremely old. Just before something happens the camera tends to looks away and comes back to show you somthing dead, but because you don't see it, it is easy to figure out that most of this is probably fake. Don't get me wrong, some of it is real and is sick, but it's not worth buying the whole set. Tape #5 & #6 contains some of the same footage from #3 and #4. Mostly shows dead animals from slaughter houses, cadavers, old police footage and is very slow. It's easy to see that many of the deaths are completely fake and were staged. Be prepared to fall asleep. It's not worth [price]! Spend your money on a something else, trust me!! Try buying one of the videos first (make sure it's not #1)and you'll see what I mean."
1,Waste of Money. FAKE,Unless you want to see fake death scenes dont waste your money on these tapes. 95% of the footage in these tapes are fake. If you want to see real death try Banned from TV 1 & 2.
5,Faces of Death - Good Old American Fun,"Whether or not the content of the movies are staged, there is no substitute for party films. These films are not only entertaining, but they are a reminder of the freedom that every American possesses to rent video captured executions if he pleases. For beautiful, for spacious skies, for crimson tinted executions."
2,We see it on tv everyday!,"When i first wiewed this movie i was shocked. How the hell could anyone whant to see a movie like this? These days they show on tv everyday, on the news,on ""The worlds scariest police shootouts"". The even showed FOD#1 on the theatre in Lund in Sweden. See it if you want, but some times the real world is worse."
5,Very disturbing,"I saw the faces of death several years ago and the images left in my mind still haunt me. I often wondered why anyone would make such a film and why anyone would want to see such horror. Then I realized it's because all of us have that thing called morbid curiosity. Like when there's a wreck on the highway and everyone stops to see what's happening when what they really want to see is if anyone's dead. The scene in these movies that I can't get out of my head is when the guy is skydiving and lands in a crocodile pit and all of his insides are floating on top of the water-- anyway, it looked pretty real to me so if real blood and guts is your thing......"
3,Fun and Fake,"I wouldn't buy these tapes, but I would definetly rent them. Some of the stuff is so ridiculous but in a good, stupid kind of way. If you want a good laugh and listen to some stupid psycho-babble from a ""Dr."" rent don't buy. By the way, has anyone seen the previews on one of the tapes called ""Brotherhood of Death?"""
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I've seen almost all of the videos in this set and as ""disturbing"" as some may think that they are...it is not. The occasional seen is real but only when showing seens of animals being slaughtered and the odd suicide attempt. If looking for an ""in your face"" account of death, there are better videos that aren't staged and all make-up."
5,Helen Oxenbury's Working,"Comforting and peaceful, Helen Oxenbury's Working moves through the happenings of a baby's day with true insight into what matters most to those people under three. It is work to use a potty, feed yourself, and get through naptime on your own! This book validates where children are in their developing lives and makes them feel successful!"
3,Bit off less than he can chew,"A pleasant enough diversion, but hardly the illuminating triumph that Crace seems to have intended. Crace is a master of entwining the intimate and the expansive, but he seems to have gotten the proportions wrong here and the book ends up feeling cramped, labored, and unworthy of the attention which generated it or which it has garnered. The stories themselves, while often delightful (although also sometimes dull), are on roughly the same level as good canapes at a fancy cocktail party: try one and you're in awe, four and you're half-sated, ten and you don't even notice them any more, because they've all started to taste alike. And no matter how many of them you pile on, they don't add up to a meal."
5,Brilliant book,"This is a brilliant book and it sure does make you think differently of food. I didn't buy it, borrowed it from the local library. I read it in about three hours tops. Some of the narative brought back memories of the time I got a serious bout of food poisoning from an oyster vendor. That was almost 12 years ago, I've never touhed oysters since."
4,great short clips of life,"great book, not what i expected. it's 64 ""shorts"" aka really short stories, like a clip-it from someone's life, usually are a paragraph to 3 pages long. very good though, nice reads, surprised he could write that much on food. some is sexual, beware people who aren't into that. i appriciated the beautiful wording and imagery"
2,Ok if you're really bored...,"I have a habit of wandering through the library and picking a random fiction to peruse. Mostly, I find works I feel lucky I chose. This book was an exception to that normal trend. If you enjoy little ramblings on nothing at all, centered around food and strange food concepts with the underlying message that we're all crazed when it comes to food, you'll love this work. If, however, you're not inclined toward reading for meaning or are looking for some deeper meaning, skip this work."
5,The Jolly Green Giant,"I received this CD today and have been playing it over and over. This is good old traditional country music. Great beat, tugging at your heart and soul type honky tonk music. Where or where are these type of songs in todays ""Country""."
3,Literature for Dummies,"This is by all means a decent anthology of literature for an introductory course, and a fairly respectable stab at a guide to good university writing.The selections are for the most part diverse, encompassing Native-American, African-American, Canadian, and English writers. Short fiction, poetry, drama, non-fiction and, to a more limited degree, film get a fairly decent treatment here, too, encompassing chronological (classical to contemporary) and thematic terrain, making this a worthwhile text for students who simply want a brief introduction to all aspects of English.Still, it is a bit unwieldly, and too often feels less like a solid anthology, and more like an 'English-for-beginners' type deal. You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,Not like the picture,"The product they advertised was what I needed; instead, I received the Examination copy that was not for resale. I needed this for class and am very disappointed that they did not advertise that it was the Eaxmination copy that says it was a free copy for the Instructor. False advertisement! Not happy."
2,Nothing Special,"It's OK, but nothing great. I had to get it for my Literature class. The organization is sometimes difficult to navigate, the stories are not always interesting, and the author seems to have a penchant for loaded questions. Still, since we are almost entirely just using it as a source for our readings, it isn't bad and it is certainly inexpensive."
4,Great Book Perfect for University of Phoenix,I found this book to be cheaper on Amazon for my Literature class at University of Phoenix. The book was shipped on time and has great writings. The pages are thin so using the Super Sticky Post-it notes ripped one of the pages upon removal. Overall I have been happy with this product.
4,Good but you have to find the right timing!,"Nothing will make it so that waxing is painless, but this stuff does a good job taking the edge off if you can find the right timing for it. I use it for full bikini waxing. I put it on kind of thick the first time about 40 minutes before my appointment. I put on another bit of it when I arrive at my waxing appointment, about 10 minutes before the appointment. It really takes the edge off, but it took me a little while to find the timing and amount that I needed for it to work well for me."
2,"Too bad, but this didn't work for me","I have a lot of pain when I get my bikini and underarms sugared, and I was excited to try this product. Unfortunately, it did not minimize my pain at all. I applied it an hour before my appointment, and even put extra on about 30 minutes before...oh well."
1,Hhhhmmmm!!!!!,"Whatever you do dont put this cream on and think that there will be no pain. I really didnt notice any difference when I had my bikini line waxed. Take 2 panadol 30 mins before its much better! My friend recommended this to me, she says it is brilliant so maybe it works for some. Ill give it another try and come back to you!"
1,Too expensive for what one gets!,"There is only one protector in this package, and it has a sticker on it that is difficult as heck to remove - I used Goo-Gone, and had some difficulty with it getting on the back. The protector is still having difficulty in getting air bubbles under it, despite the applicator that comes in the package. Not worth the money in my humble opinion."
5,Great filter for the Kenmore,I purchased two filters for my Kenmore refrigerator. They fit in the refrigerator perfectly and appear to work well. I bought two because they were cheaper when purchased in quantity and I didn't want to go thru the process of buying them again too soon.
5,Cheaper than in stores!!!,Will buy this product again thru this website. The water filter works perfectly and does make the water taste better. It is way cheaper online than at the store. I would recommend this product to everyone.
5,Whirlpool filter is great!,"Whirlpool 4396701 Top Mount Refrigerator, Quarter Turn Water Filter Non-Cyst, 1-PackThis refrigerator water filter was exactly what it was supposed to be. It's a great value for a good product."
1,Did not last for more than a month,"Did not last for more than a month. The water came out extremely slow, and then almost not at all. Bought two, and thought the first was defective, but the same thing happened with the second. Called Whirlpool, who said Amazon is not an authorized dealer so they couldn't do anything. Talked to Amazon, who said they could give me a pro-rated refund. I didn't bother since it had been too many months since I purchased them so the postage would have been more money than the refund. Very disappointed. I bought my next one directly from Whirlpool and it continues to work."
3,Why so expensive?,Expensive...Too much to pay for a piece of plastic that's not even manufactured in the US..And it doesn't remove all of the fishy odor from Lake Erie water.
2,Not what you think it is - but it will work somewhat,"Yes it is a 'Quarter Turn', but it will not resemble or function or fit like the OEM one your removing from your fridge. This one resembles one of those super fat Sharpies you buy during the holidays for parcel marking. It is about half the diameter and a wee bit shorter than the OEM one. I managed to make it work, but I had to keep the fridges plastic base grill off and stow the fridges OEM rear slip-on twist knob in the kitchen drawer for safe keeping till next year when I'll just pay 10 bucks more at Lowes, and get twice the volume, better/faster water flow and an original OEM fit. If you can find the OEM's at a discount, ask the seller for dimensions and if whats pictured is what you get."
5,Refrigerator water filter,"Ordered from Amazon.com cheaper than I could buy locally, with free shipping. Good deal."
4,Water Filter,"Product was easy to install. Worked great as soon as it was used. Price was pretty good. After installation, required 2 gallons of flushing. Just so you will know."
3,Works well,Filters work pretty well but don't last the prescribed time before flow diminishes significantly (~2-2.5 mos). We have a water softener and also water in our area is very hard so prob due to that more than the quality of the filter.
5,Nice,They were brand new as stated and they fit right in without any problems. I will buy again when it time to change them again.
2,Refrigerator water filter,"Within weeks of installation water began having an unpleasant chemical taste. This filter is hard to find so I bought it through amazon despite similar reviews. I don't know what controls the chinese have for the products they sell us, but I wish we could get this from a US manufacturer."
2,Slow water flow,Purchase and installed filter this past July. After less than 6 months of use water flow is very slow. If I have to replace filter twice a year; this water filter is not worth it.
3,"Pricey but coming down, installation a hassle for me","I used to buy this filter at Lowes and they charged an OUTRAGEOUS price, close to $40 I believe. Therefore, when I saw it here for $27/28, I was relieved to find I could get it for less. For me, I have to use a pair of pliers to turn the filter into the place it goes in the refrigerator. I suppose it does what it's supposed to do. I've never had my filtered water tested. It's a bummer to pay for this every 6 months (recommended replacement), so I often go over 6 months, unless the price continues to go down.."
2,Water tastes funny,"I swapped out the filter which was obviously very easy, and the new filter does not leak or anything.But, with the new filter our water tastes slightly ""chemically"".We are going to try buying another filter, but for now, we just aren't using the water from our fridge."
4,great price on this on,"workd well, did what it was suppose to do. I bought it online because Lowes and Home Depot do not sell them"
5,Rabbit Bedding,My Daughter and our bunny really enjoyed the color. It appeared to be very absorbant. We will diffinitely purchase again
4,Bedding for hamster and rabbit,"This bedding works perfectly for my son's hamster, because he loves it. The rabbit has a different opinion of it, though. The rabbit refuses to use it, and throws it out of the cage."
4,"Bunny Loves it, but a bit messy","The bunny loves this stuff. He likes to eat it, poo in it, and burrow/nest in it. It's odor absorbent and easy to clean up. The only complaint I have with this as opposed to using something like wood chips is you can't take it outside and clean/hose down the cage and expect it just to be ""mulch"" like material."
2,Good concept; poorly executed,"I was very excited to see a critical book covering Bishop Spong's work. It is always important to read both sides of any argument, and this book attempts to give a cogent response to Spong's theses. However, the actual execution of these articles was very poorly done. First, it was obvious that this was a series of completely independent articles that were only minimally edited, resulting in a massive amount of repetition. Second, the commentaries were mostly emotional, and rarely delved into Spong's specific arguments. There are 5-10 pages of actual rigorous criticism in the entire book (these pages do bring up 2-3 good points). Overall, this book does not successfully shoot down even a minority of Spong's theses. Buy it for your reference library, but only to demonstrate unconvincing arguments."
1,In the spirit of Christian brotherhood???,"The back page blurb begins with ""In the spirit of Christian brotherhood..."" If the tone of the book's content - even if the tone of the preface's content - is an example of Christian brotherhood, I sure wouldn't want to see what most of these writers would come up with ""in a spirit of Christian non-brotherhood."""
3,Too Soon,"The principal difficulty with this book is timing. If it had come out as a response to Spong's theses, its structure would have made more sense; as it is, there is a lot of repetition and a certain inability to focus. I think a single author presentation would have been more effective and coherent."
2,sorry but it was nothing special,This storyline that had so much potential but the main characters had little substance and their relationship throughout most of the book was fickle. I got it from the library; thank goodness I didn't buy it.
5,Takes the hum out of Hum-Bug,"I have been trying to put some of my best vinyl record on CD without sucess due to a very loud hum when connecting my record player to the sound card on my computer. After about a year of trying to do this I did some searching and found out that a ground loop isolator was the answer. I had never heard of such a thing so I wondered where in the world could I find such a thing. I went right to Amazon and found several. I ordered this item as it was not the cheapest or the most expensive. When it arrived I saw the instructions said it was for mobile use. I was about ready to return it but thought what the heck, I'll try it anyway. I was very scepical but hooked it up anyway. As soon as the connection was made I was greeted with dead silence. I thought oh boy, it shorted out everything. I started a record and to my amazement out came music with no hum at all. My records are now on CD and on the external hard drive for backup. It sure did the job for me."
1,Did not eliminate ground Loop Hum,"While the product arrived quickly, it did not work properly. I say this confidently because I ordered a ""Boss Audio Systems Car Ground Loop Isolator (B25N)"" from Amazon it worked just fine. They look similar and there really is only one way to hook it up.The Scosche product did NOT reduce the ground loop hum. It DID attenuate the bass though, which is a bad thing.Do not purchase this product. Consider the BOSS product I mentioned above, also available on Amazon prime."
2,save your money,"Not worth it. After about two months the sun just dried it up, and it fell apart into small pieces. Shouldn't it be able to withstand the sun?"
1,Item not as described or shown in picture,What I received was NOT a natural Raffia woven design. It is plastic- and not woven. What I received is absolutely not the item shown in the picture. I have contacted PartyAmerica twice and they have completely ignored me.
5,Nice pads under adverse conditions,We use these pads on our recumbent tandem and they stop a heavy bike with no problems or fade. I really like them.
5,Works,"The Kool Stop Pro-Max pads are different thicknesses, and they go in through the end cap rather than through the slot.Put the thinner one in first (labelled ""in"") and then the thicker (labelled ""out"").Reverse the end cap before screwing it back in; it's asymmetric to accomodate the thicker pad.I assume when that pad wears down, you're supposed to reverse the cap again.The pads work noticeably better than the originals.The magnet on the end cap probably ought to be preserved in a baggie or something, rather than lost in the lawn."
1,Does not fit Trek 3900 w/ Promax disc,"I was hoping this would fit from the reviews I read. But they didn't fit my Trek 3900 Disc Promax brakes. One side pad is to thick and wont fit unless all brake componets are all the way loosened and the rotor still rubs. Waste of money, not worth the time to send back."
4,Cheap,Ok all these are is allthread with a plastic sheath and joystick knob screwed on at one end with a couple nuts. I had to trim the end of the sheath so it would fit closer to the knob end and I really wish these were threads cast in plastic or dipped in latex or rubber coating instead of a cheap sleeve that doesn't fit well.
4,Great But Loud,"I bought this since I live in Florida and the storms that come through here can leave people with no power. At first I had my doubts about this. So this is what I think of it.Pros: small, uses D batteries, last a long time, works when power is out and delivers what it is supposed to do.Cons: Loud. this thing is loud but I have an aquarium cabinet and I put it under there on the shelf and I never heard it when the power went off. So if you have it out in the open, it will be loud. Suggest placing a cloth or something underneath it so it will cut down on the noise.Overall, I love it and will not be without one. I only gave it 4 stars because it is so loud. The rest is definitely a 5 star."
2,"Weak, cheap","Will only pump air about 3 inches under water, then the pressure becomes too much.Batteries are loose so if you shake it it will turn on and off.very short power (3 feet max if not 2 feet) cord makes it obnoxious to set up on a fish tank. Has a clip on the back that will not fit on anything you'd have on our around your aquarium, so difficult to mount or put anywhere.It does what it is supposed to do though, which is turn on when the power goes out. I have mine so the tube is 1 inch under water so itll break surface tension in the case of power outage. Very cheaply does what it says it will."
4,Great product,"Does exactly what it claims to... Minus the silent part, It is actually very loud compared to other air pumps that I own, However it is a battery backup for my tank, So I am very happy with it!"
5,Battery pump saved my fish,"I bought this as a life insurance plan for my fish. Ha ha. Just in case we lost power. Well unfortunately we got hit by hurricane sandy, and my fish stayed alive for days without power because of this product. If you love your fish, this is a must to have!"
2,Better than nothing,"Purchased this as an economy pump for when the power cuts out,,,well it is definitely that HOWEVER it is Obnoxiously LOUD and only disperses a minimal amount of air,,,i have a 55g tankstill better than nothing and better than a tank filled with dead bodies"
1,Drivel,"C. Stuart Chapman's biography of the great historian of the Civil War is not worth purchasing. Chapman's great failing is to draw negative conclusions about Foote, as through Chapman's viewing of his subject through the lens of 21st century politics. A press secretary for the leftist Rep. Barbara Lee, Chapman's biography castigates the historian for having failed to offer himself up as a martyr during the Civil Rights struggles of the 50s and 60s. With such a ""foundation"" set in place, the edifice is not a pretty sight to see (or read)."
3,Not bad for the price,"This was purchased from amazon and arrived quickly and undamaged.When I sprayed it on paper it went on heavy with a combination sweet, floral, soapy, lilac, light cinnamon, and musk.On skin it quickly lost all but the sweet, floral and musk, with a hint of soapiness. After 15 - 30 minutes, only the floral sweetness remained. After an hour the scent had diminished alot, and by 2 hours it was completely overpowered by the skin.It would have been great if this perfume held up anywhere near as well as the paper strip we tested it on. But, it was just disappointing instead. For the price, and because of it somewhat small size, I would recommend because it can be kept in a purse to re-apply. Even with the loss of initial scents I would have rated it 4 stars, it still had a nice smell, bordering on a more mature type of aroma. But, it has little staying power."
4,Gift for my Mother,"This is the only perfume my Mother has worn for 40+ years. She loves it, I love the way she smells and so many people have commented how nice this fragrance is on my Mother."
5,Soft and sweet,"This is such a lovely, and not overpowering at all, scent. The wonderful smell that it has reminds me of the roaring twenties ... from a distant time, floral and powdery and spice filled. It's a great fragrance!"
4,Good intro to examining your role in relationships,Helpful for therapists. Difficult to implement on your own without the help of a therapist. Take time to stop and do the exercises to get the full benefit.
4,review,"Good book! Finding it very insightful and very ""real"" life! Makes for entertaining reading while learning."
5,An outstanding resource.,"Dr. Beck's book isn't just another pop-psych guide to saving your marriage.It is an extraordinarily helpful resource by one of the foundersof cognitive psychology. Each of the chapters illuminates how maritalpartners create conflicts; how they can understand their problems;and how they can mobilize their resources for making effectivechange. A sensible, sensitive book for those striving to createa more fulfilling marriage."
5,The Best and Most Pragmatic Book for Couples Counseling,"As a clinical social worker and marriage and family therapist, I do a lot of marriage counseling and couples work. I have found that Aaron Beck's 'Love is Never Enough' is the clearest and most effective book to use with couples. Additionally, it has the best outcome.Couples, under a therapist's guidance, can use this book together. It is easy to read, has great hand-outs and is pragmatic. It focuses on the day-to-day issues that many couples find themselves getting stuck on.While I think that couples could try to use this book themselves without a therapist's guidance, and are likely to benefit from it, this would apply only to couples who do not have serious issues. Couples with serious issues need to work with a therapist. A book alone is not sufficient."
5,Perfect!,"These earrings are exactly as described. They are beautiful and have incredible luster. These will be my only pair of earrings, and I'll wear them every single day, so it was important to me that they be just right, and they are!"
5,Simple Wisdom,"Orthodox Christians who recognize that they are functioning at far too basic a level to hope to profit from exposure to the Philocalia and similar authorities, will rejoice in this straightforward discussion of ""the one thing needful."" The author achieves great clarity without a hint of condescension. This book is an invaluable invitation to ""the life in Christ!"""
5,The Narrow Way,"This book was recommended to me by an orthodox friend, and I have read and re-read it. The words are direct and the path of the believer as a disciple depicted as ""The Narrow Way"" described in Scripture. The path described by the ascetics, howeveer, is one desired by a believer who seeks a closer, obedient walk with God over a lifelong process."
3,Those who can't do...,"...teach.Ok, a little unfair, perhaps. Hedgecoe's books are always well designed and present technical information in a well-illustrated and adequately explanitory manner. The many photographers who started out (myself included) by reading one of his tomes are testimony to his ubiquity in this market.But is it me, or are his actual photographs somehow rather unexciting and formulaic stuff? If you want to learn about great photography, look at pictures by great photographers, rather than those who seem to spend more of their time teaching and writing about it than doing it."
3,"some good ideas, lacks detail","I bought this book thinking that it would teach me about technique, apeture, etc. Unfortunately, the book lacks detail and most of the book is made up of photographs and then the author's description of how he got that photograph. However, the author has some pretty good ideas for photographs, and thus I used some of his ideas for trying out some photographs of my own. I still was looking for something with more detail and instruction."
2,Appliance Instructions or Photographer's Handbook?,"First of all, I'm not a Professional Photographer, that's the reason why I purchased this book in the first place. I like the topics and the physical size of the book. Other than actual content, I purchased this book as a ""Reference Book"" so I like to refer to it in the field when my hands are holding 2 camera's and a tripod.What I don't like about this book is, that to me it's structured in a way like reading an appliance instructions. Pages are set up in a way where the printing is TOO small to read, even with reading glasses. The book is printed in very light ink, very difficult to read, even in bright light. Chapters are not clearly divided, it's like one big 'run on' sentence.Topics are too technical and is really written for the Professional Photographer in mind. Maybe if the title was changed to, ""Professional Photographers Handbook"", then I wouldn't be writing the review."
3,Good broad-based reference,"This book is good for those looking for a wide surface treatment of the whole spectrum of photography. Points of disucssion are almost always clearly illustrated with photographs or high-quality drawings, and many specific examples of equipment are given. This book will inspire you to try many different photographic techniques. However, all those nifty photos and pages devoted to escoterica don't leave much room for the basics, and so this book can't be reccomended as a decent manual or textbook for raw beginners trying to improve their photography."
4,Looking to become a Pro get this book,"John Hedgecoe book ""The Photographer's handbook"" is great to have by your side. John just update and made it better then is was. The book has more then 1250 illustrations and is packed with great tips from the pro John Hedgecoe ! ! This book belongs on every photographer's bookshelf"
3,Thinking of others...,"Elizabeth Wakefield, the ""good"" twin, meets Pamela Jacobson, a girl with a disability. Elizabeth befriends Pamela and learns that they have lots in common. But Elizabeth is also on the planning committee for the School Olympics Day, and decides that everyone must be included. Must to everyone's disapproval, the Olympics are changed so Pamela can participate with her disability. This book shows the goodness of Elizabeth and makes readers more aware of people who are different. While I agree it isn't the most exciting, give it a try. You will enjoy the trick Elizabeth and Jessica play on their older brother, Steven, in which Jessica falls and breaks her leg."
3,Pamela's Abilities,"It hurts Pamela that she has to miss out on running around and playing sport like the other kids,as she has a heart condition.Jessica is the head of the committee handling the upcoming sports day at school.Elizabeth really wants to make sure that Jessie-woo makes the sport carnival fair to all students.But Jessica is pretty clueless as usual,just like when she climbs to her brothers window to scare him and then takes a fall that sprains her ankle..."
3,"You don't like them, but your girlfriend does","And she listens to them *all the time* when you're not around, like when you and your ""band"" are practicing that garage-sounding stuff or that completely useless double-bass metal sound that never goes out of fashion because it never was in fashion to begin with.They're shallow, their puerile, they're probably drunk on most of these tracks, and they're on your girlfriend's iPod and you're not. Ha-hah!"
5,"Finally, new rock with energy!","I'm definitely older than the average person that would buy this album. But these guys are fantastic! The last rock band I remember with this amount of energy is the Violent Femmes. I bought this CD for the lyrics alone - and was surprised by the fantastic guitar work.These guys must be influenced by the Violent Femmes, Hendrix, Beatles, even the Who. But they have a completely new sound that is not retro or a rip-off of any of the above.Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed. Only 2 so-so tracks. The rest kick ass."
3,Louis XIV,I searched far and wide for this album and am not sure why. They have a couple of good songs but something is just a little off...
2,Sadly just posturing,"Once again the great American hype deflates as Louis XIV just dosent have the tunes to make good on the promise of its early singles. Sadly we have yet another case of an American band with some promise and a few good ideas washed away by their preoccupation with their image. Note to band: spend more time on the songs, less time doing your hair and you might make a record people actually care about. Ever notice how a British next big thing band (ie Franz, Futureheads, Bloc Party, Razorlight) tends to have some actual tunes to back up the hype. It's a fundamental difference in the two cultures I suppose. Lets forget the pretense and you can still deliver great tunes with a sense of adventure and hip swagger. Take your lessons from the British, it sure worked for the Killers and Interpol. Next!"
1,Boooooring!,"You can read, in most every review, about how Jason Hill combines ""original, sexual lyrics"" with his band's breed of post-punk/60's-style progressions. But if you want the truth, read pitchforkmedia.com's review. This record is utter trash. The band is sickiningly untalented, Hill can't sing, and his lyrics are so 7th-grade sexual-clever that they are emabrassing... and what's up with the eyeliner, guys? How can you go from being in an alt-country twee pop band to an all-of-a-sudden indie post-punk band (without the good looks!)? The riffs on this album are all predictable, and the music is just a plain lazy, whorish attempt to milk the new new-wave Cash Cow. This is clearly the most blantant ape of T.Rex, Bowie, etc that this ""revival"" has to offer. You will see Louis XIV (even that name rips off the historical angle of Franz Ferdinand) go down in FLAMES with other boring whores such as The Bravery, The Futureheads, Kaiser Chiefs, and Kasabian. Bad - F"
1,Boring.,"Every single song is about sex, sex, and more sex.Who wants 37 minutes of nothing but that? Anyone can write songs about sex, it's the true sign of a good band when they can talk about OTHER things!"
3,Louis XXX,"The members of Louis XIV are either over- or undersexed. It's not so easy to tell which one. Much has been made about their lyrical content (yes, folks, pretty much every line is about Doing It), but I can look beyond that. So they prefer smarmy to smart, wolf-whistles to wit. Although content counts for something, it doesn't mean the music is bad, right?Nah, it's not bad. In fact, it's just what it wants to be: sleazy glam-rock riffs sandwiched between raunchy rhythms. No one's trying to do anything new here, that's for certain, and you'll see shadows of other, better bands (the comparisons have been made to death elsewhere; I won't go into it) dancing behind the notes.Taken for something profound or even intriguing, ""Secrets"" is sure to be a disappointment. But if, like the greaseballs who populate this band (not an insult -- they LOVE being greaseballs), all you want is some grimy, groin-grabbing goof-rock, this is your ticket in the door."
3,okay,"vulgar and obnoxious, but the songs are so darn catchy. They're okay, and sound like Hot Hot Heat and the White Stripes, only not as good"
5,Great CD,Awesome band. Every song on the cd is great. its been nearly 10 years since i last purchased a cd and i broke that streak for this one.
3,Lite source LSM-197BLK,Item is ok. base clam falls short of being able to hold steady enough to keep from falling over..base plastic seams kinda cheap and woulb break if over tightened.
5,The Singling Nun,"Very Pleased, excellent quality. Highly recommend to everyone. Thanks for a great transaction."
4,A Heartwarming film,"This is a well written story with some serious undertones and some lovely music. With Debbie Reynolds, Ricardo Montalban and Chad Everett starring, this movie brings 'wholesome' back to the screen. It is a true story of a Nun who became an overnight singing sensation and then becomes torn between the choices of bringing her music to the world or God. She makes her decision and this heartwarming film will lighten your mood and bring a smile to your face."
3,Fun Not Fact,"For those being so critical of the American movie producers let me say that the blame for the fictional version of Jeannine Deckers life lies directly on Fichermont convent. The only way the film could be made was if it bore no resemblance to the real life of Sr. Luc Gabriel. The true story of Jeannine Deckers' life will be out this year, which includes the tale of how this movie was produced. Watch my web site for a release date.D.A. Chadwick(...)"
3,Holy Dross,"Passable entertainment could have been made around this account of a pop music phenomenon. Instead the makers of this flick have fashioned a film that's bogged down in overripe melodrama and crass sentiment. There are some redeeming qualities that salvage the movie. The songs aren't bad even though ""Dominique"" is treated like a throwaway. Good performances abound from not only star Debbie Reynolds as well as veterans Greer Garson, Agnes Moorhead, Ricardo Montablan, and Juanita Moore. A tinge of nostalgia can be derived by a cameo by famed TV impressario Ed Sullivan. Oh, well. We can wait with baited breath for ""Tiny Tim-The Movie""."
2,Widescreen only?,The DVD is in perfect shape. Would like to have known it was widescreen only. I don't do widescreen.
2,Vow of intellectual poverty?,"Though the film's underlying theme (difficult choices, such as one often faces in religious life) is valid and strong, there are very few scenes which fulfil this potential. The majority of the action and dialogue reduces the powerful situation of being a missionary nun to comic strip depictions. Sad that a film with considerable talents amongst its actors has to be this silly and poorly developed.I remember well when the real ""Singing Nun"" (on whose music, not life, the film is based) was suddenly a sensation. I must admit that I now wonder if it was novelty alone which caused this. With few exceptions (Beyond the Stars' lilting melody being one), the quality of the music is poor.This film has neither the religious impact of several classics I could mention, nor even the fun of the Trouble with Angels. I would say that it was the equivalent of ""Peanuts goes to the Vatican"", but that comic strip had more depth."
3,The singing nun,"liked it. Now i know what all the hype was when I was 6yrs old. Adorable story with some serious undertones, well written!"
4,"Very good movie! Not very know, but very good discovery!","Verry good movie, not know by many. Debbie Reynolds is great, nice voice and good interpretation of the orle and songs. The story is very different than th real story of Soeur Sourire, but it gives an idea of the great and fast success she encountered. For a nun it was a first and maybe a last. There is very good messages in the movie though and a good moral to the story. The songs, mostely from the real Singing Nun, are lively and well sung by Debbie Reynolds can put sun in a cloudy day :-). It is also great sea Agnes Moorehead (who plays Endora in the series Bewitched) play another role. What a good actress.I recommand the movie to everyone who loves to immerse in ""real story"" movies and musicals."
5,My Review,"My sister had seen this movie when we were younger and named her first born after hearing the song ""Dominique."" It was a gift she really cherished when I gave it to her."
2,superfluous,MR. HEILBUT'S BOOK IS AN EXERCISE IN ARDENT HOMOEROTIC ONEIRIC WISHFUL THINKING. MUCH LIKE KENNTH STARR WISHED PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS GUILTY OF SOMETHING MR. HEILBUT FAILS MUCH LIKJE STARR TO EVEN COME CLOSE TO PROVING MANN'S ALLEGED HOMOSEXUALITY WHICH HE IS TASKED WITH BY DINT OF HAVING THE TEMERITY TO MAKE THE CHARGE IN THIS DREARY TOME MORE MCCARTHYISM THAN RESPONSIBLE LITERATURE
3,Classical Rock meets Sgt. Pepper,"I bought the album for ""Slark"", an old favorite of mine. The rest of the CD is an interesting mix of classical-style theme and variation writing, mixed with a Beatles ""Sgt. Pepper"" flavor of bouncy tunes and lyrics that kids (young and old) can enjoy. I think that it will take some time before I can really hang onto what must have been side one of the LP, but side 2 with Marzo and Slark is very entertaining."
3,"I never thought I would hear ""Slark"" again!","The album is a artsy fartsy classical rock thing. On a whole it is a dated piece. Ah, but Slark! Slark is a must hear!"
2,i'm not too impressed!,"I think STACKRIDGE made only one good album and that album wasEXTRAVAGANZA. Their other albums, like this one, had brilliantlyrics and funny and unusual song titles, but very dull, uninter-esting music. I bought this cd because the other reviewers wereraving about the song SLARK. Tis an unusual song, that SLARK, butI think it goes on a bit too long. I do like the opening trackGRANDE PIANO; it's a catchy, likable pop song and very BEATLE-esque, but the rest of this just doesn't grab me!"
4,So... What Happened??,"Circa 1988 a couple of guys named Mark Long and Marcus Bell formed a group called So and put out this album. The music video for the song ""Are You Sure"" was played on MTV for a couple of weeks and then *poof* was gone. It's a shame really because I thought ""Are You Sure"" was fantastic and I was certain that So would go far, or at least farther than total obscurity. If you're really into very good yet relatively unknown 80's new wave/pop music, then I definitely recommend picking up this CD. ""Are You Sure"" is worth it by itself, and the other songs aren't too bad as well!"
3,Sturdy but looks cheap,"Simple brushed stainless look. Cheap looking, but appeared to be rigid and strong if that is what is important to the buyer."
2,Not as good as I had hoped....,"First off, build quality is poor. Flat bar used as center braces was cut too short, maybe 3/8 to 1/2 inch. Rather than get a piece that is cut to proper length, the welder tried to weld the short piece into place. On one weld in particular, the weld length is less than a quarter inch long. The rest of the ""Open Air"" weld was just left, poor workmanship!Holes are punched, not drilled. When you punch tubing, it dents it in, looks to be about a 1/4 inch on both sides.I know I will be welding on this in the near future.As far as ""Adjustable working width, 18-Inch - 42-Inch for versatility"", that is misleading. Yes you can move the tines narrower, but the implement frame is still 42"", it does not adjust like other brands."
3,Agri-Fab Row Crop Cultivator,"Very cheaply made, light weight piece of equipment. Sloppy welds, too thin of metal used for tines, holes punched instead of drilled, poor paint. I don't believe it will hold up to much punishment pulling it through the dirt and rocks. I bought mine sight unseen online, I would suggest to anyone else to go look at one at local home supply outlet that sells Agri-Fab equipment to decide for yourself whether or not adequate to do the job you want it for.At the very least they could have powder coated the parts, I had paint bubbled up on the cultivator tines, supposedly new out of the box. I do wonder if it came from factory like that, or returned item touched up and sold again.Cultivator was relatively inexpensive piece of equipment, I suppose you get what you pay for. It did not meet my expectation of a quality tool. There are couple other companies that make a similar item, someone might want to shop around."
4,Great price for OEM filter,"It's the OEM oil filter. It works as it should. The main reason I ordered it from Amazon is the price. It was MUCH less than I could get it for locally. Ford has high standards for their OEM products. While I'm sure some aftermarket ones could be the same or even possibly better, for my driving this works great. My truck is tuned but I'm no racer."
5,Real Motorcraft Product - Works Fine,For those that are looking for a genuine Motorcraft oil filter for the Ford 6.0L PSD ; this is the one.
5,Great book!,"I bought this book for my kids last year and it's become one of our favorites. We have read it all year long. They love the story, so entertaining. My favorite part are the illustrations. They are fun and capture the story perfectly. My son always comments on Santa's pants. They are hilarious. It's a great gift for the holidays."
5,The World's Number 1 Santa Book,"This book is a lot of fun. My 2yo daughter was petrified of Santa and this book has enabled us to overcome this.After a couple reads at bedtime, it was impossible to get past various pages without having to allocate the various toys, wrapping paper and gifts to each of her friends and family. It became a wonderful exercise for her memory, as she would remember that the white paper with blue stars is for ""Pop"" and the scooter is for ""Joshie"" and big present with the multi-coloured stipes is for ""Nanna"", etc. etc. Daddy (me) was allocated the really lame ""pink dots on orange"" present and I am the one who has read it to her a gazillion times: charming!Well written, fun, cheeky - this book is great and has provided us with a lot of joy.(Miss 2 y.o. can recite the book front to back - that's how many times we've read it!)"
5,100 Questions & Answers for Brain Tumors,I got this book to read before hubby had an appointment with her. We have never had a doctor go so far out of their way to help us get some answers to hubby's medical problem. A really great doctor!
3,Very nice,CeCe shines again..... what more can I say but that she is simply the greatest Gospel voice anywhere!
5,Great CD,I Love this CD. I play it often while driving alone with the volume up. It should be a part of everyone's Christmas collection.
1,Where are the illustrations?,"My friend had this book, and her version I would give 5 stars. Very meaningful message. It was (I am guessing here) around 12"" x 9"" in size and included wonderful illustrations that went with the written material, and I was very taken with it, and ordered one for myself.My book arrived and was only 5 1/4"" x 8 1/2"" and includes only words, and not one single illustration. The illustrations are and integral part of the book. I can't believe they would shrink the book and leave them out! Because of this, I give only one star."
3,MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIPS,After reading 'A Virtuous Woman' (which I thought was awesome) I was disappointed in 'A Cure for Dreams'. There wasn't much of a plot. It seemed that the only point the author was trying to put forth was how bad and weak men are. I expected more. To me the book was too shallow.
4,Wonderful Novel,"This is a wonderful, entertaining novel of women relationships. It is set in the rural South. I really enjoyed it."
1,A Cure for Dreams is a Nightmare!,"I gave this book 1 star because zero was not an option. I read a lot and this is the worse book I've read in a long time. I would have put it down without finishing, but the book was short and I kept thinking it would redeem itself. Please, do NOT waste your time on 'Dreams' when there are so many really good books out there."
2,Could Have Been Better,"This reads like an author's first novel. Not a bad read, but certainly not as powerful as Ellen Foster, A Virtuous Woman, or Sights Unseen. Usually I'm able to associate the title of a book with the plot, or characters of the novel. I'm at a loss for the correlation here. If you happen to be between reads, and have already read Gibbons other work, then go ahead and give this a shot. If you've never read any of her work and this is your introduction to Gibbons, try one of her other novels first."
4,I really enjoyed this book!,"I read ELLEN FOSTER,and A VIRTUOUS WOMAN, and thought that they were excellent books. A CURE FOR DREAMS was not nearly as ""deep"" as the other two, but equally as thought provoking. I thought a lot about the relationship between generations, and the effect they have on our lives. I think the reason I did enjoy this one so much, was because it was more upbeat, and an easy read. Good vacation book!"
3,"Lets Just Say, It's Not For All People...","This guide, like I said, is not for all people. It bring the experience from the game down a few notches because it tells you everything that happened. When I saw this guide, paged few it a bit, and then decided not to buy it due to giving away of everything. It is very good for newbies that want to learn the basic mechanics, and know all of the moves. This is a very easy game to button mash with though, so there is hardly any skill. But, if you want everything given away, and know how do every move that there is, this book is for you!!!"
2,"Misleading title, and lots of errors and omissions","Fortunately, I didn't buy this book -- I checked it out from the library. If it were software, it would still be beta-ware. It seems to cover stuff in the most basic form, and assumes everything will go fine -- in addition, there are a lot of errors. But of course, Linux/Ubuntu is still tricky, esp. for beginners, which is why the Ubuntu forums are buzzing!The author has a nice style -- but this book is just way too incomplete, esp. on essential and common problems, all of which I had--printing, wifi, dual-boot, etc. Do what I did -- check it out from the library before spending your money."
4,"Content plus readability, AHHH!","Found this book to be immediately useful. Am a ""newbie"" to Ubuntu Linux and need all the help I can get. The book came through. It did it in less than 700 pages and there was sufficient ink on the pages. Easier to handle than the 900 page behemoth, Thank you, Apress."
5,Great Ubuntu book,I am using ubuntu on an old laptop. I am pleased with the book an Ubuntu.Provides me with what I need for a desktop guide. I am now looking at installing on a XP machine I have using the guidance provided.
3,Talk to your IT,"I am an absolute beginner using linux and found it very frustrating that time and time again I was told to ""Talk to your IT or network administatrator to get the Network address"". This was for configuring the Network printer, connecting to wireless router...you get the idea. If you are an absolute beginner and have a wireless setup in your house this book will not help you get the info you need. You need to talk to an IT to get everything wireless setup. I was really hoping this book would give me everything I need to get started sadly it didn't."
2,Pedantic,"Author spends too much time on the history of Linux. His writing style is both pedantic and stilted. He tries to cover too much information in one book and, in my opinion, doesn't cover any of it in an easy to read style."
1,Do Not Purchase,"Book is a ""second edition"" that needs significant editing. References on the pages are not consistent with the text; screenshots use more than one computer so there is no consistency to assist the reader. The supplied DVD for Ubuntu 6.10 would not load so I had to download a copy for myself. If you're interested in Ubuntu, the Forums and online assistance are better resources. Book was returned to Amazon with essentially this same evaluation. They DID credit me for the return."
1,Save your time and money,"This book has been promoted for the Novice or Professional yet caters to neither. Aunt Betty will find the author assumptions and lack of step by step instructions fustrating, while the professional will find the lack of substance and gloss comparable with that of a Windows help file. In either case the reader with be both disappointed and unrewarded with their efforts only to be demanding a refund from Amazon."
3,"Easy read, old info","This book is a great read. I found it warn and friendly. If you are new to Ubuntu and do not like tech books, this is for you. One thing though, it was out dated when I got it new. Ubuntu comes out every 6 months, so this book will always be behind unless the author starts using the beta to write the book, which would be the best idea. I would also have liked to see more on Kubunu, Edubuntu and Xubuntu as well. They are all part of the official Ubuntu family and one may have worked better of me as a reader."
4,Excellent for linux beginners,"This is an excellent book for beginners of Linux/Ubuntu. Has detailed instructions on installation and usage and system maintainence. I wish the DVD were a little more up to date though. However, that is no big deal as almost all things Linux can be downloaded from the internet."
5,Beginning Ubuntu Linux,"To start off this is a great book for beginners Much better 100 times than the Dummy' book Great Reccommend, Good Reference & training book"
2,A bit on the dry side,"Another review called this a ""compilation of dates, names and places."" I agree. Lot's of facts but no great themes or compelling stories. While I was reading it I thought ""This is why people think history is boring."""
2,A lot to wade through,"Wow. This book is dense and I really didn't plan on reading pedantic prose that I need to have a dictionary nearby to decipher. I was hoping for a more condensed, precise read that hit the highlights first with maybe more info if I wanted. Felt like I was reading something for a college history class! Maybe I misread the description? Not recommended if you're a traveller looking for an overview."
4,"Jah Wobble offers spectacular bass lines, Evan Parker......","I have been a fan of Jah Wobble from his earliest days in Public Image Limited.So, am I biased to give a review, based on my longterm fascination for this guy's bass playing and selection of talent that have accompanied him over the past 20+ years? No.If anyone has had the pleasure of hearing free-jazz saxophonist Evan Parker live, you were certainly astounded by the tenacity and the skill that he performs with, be it the circular breathing or the range of notes that this man travels with to explore new spaces in sound.I loved the mood and tempo that develops throughout this album and the incorporation of dynamic instrumentation, including goat horns, thai flute, bagpipes, with Jah's Bass and Evan's Tenor Sax.If you enjoy explorations in sound and rhythm, you will treasure this album."
4,"Fine for kids, not very bright","Not nearly as fragile as I was led to believe by other comments. This is a solidly-built toy with a thick plastic hilt and retractable blade. Yes, whacking it on something will probably break it, but it will also probably break whatever got whacked.The light is disappointing - you can only see it in the dark. It's fine for Halloween night, but for daytime play you needn't bother. Luckily, the blade itself is colored, so it still looks good enough for kids even in the daytime.Once nice feature is a little catch that can be swung out to keep the blade retracted into the hilt. That's nice - I've seen other toys without this feature and the blade flops out every time you turn them over.This toy received the coveted ""Thumbs Up"" award from my 8-year-old."
4,A must-listen for all fans of musical theatre and musical judaica,"I don't have much to add to the first review except that this CD blew me away. As a fan of musical theatre and a yiddishophile, I absolutely loved this CD. Unfortunately, there is a very small audience for this kind of work but hopefully a foundation that is dedicated to jewish music will sponsor a staged mounting of this show."
5,GREAT Fruit Tisanes,"If you LOVE hot tea, and especially hot fruit tisanes ('tea' made with fruit & herb and no actual tea leaf) skip the domestic USA brands and head right to the brits!!! No matter what flavour you just will NOT go wrong with London Fruit & Herb, Heath and Heather Herbal or Ty-Phoo Fruit & Herb. This particular flavour is like 'drinking' strawberries and vanilla cream.All of these companies have such vibrant flavours and unlike some of the other companies I have tried from the USA they just don't have that 'water-y' taste. Flavours are STRONG and vibrant. For a REAL wake-up go for the Black Currant flavours.Cheers!"
3,The Digest-Size novel is NOT a graphic novel,"I've returned to the X-Men after a near 20 year absence and I've been trying to catch up. This is a illustrated novelization of the comics, not a reprint of the comics themselves. Because I still haven't seen the comics, I don't know how well this version compares to the original. Assuming that the book is accurate, I feel that I got the story and it wasn't exciting enough to make me want to get the comics. As it says on the back, the Phalanx is a techno-organic alien life form. It's here to take over the world. It can assimilate animals and regular humans, but [so far], not mutants. Characters appearing: Gambit, Professor X, Psylocke, Bishop, Dr. Moira McTaggart, Jubilee, Wolverine, Storm, Iceman, Archangel, Beast, Rogue, Banshee, Emma Frost, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Cable, Sabretooth, [and as yet untrained mutants whom I gather became Generation X] Monet, Husk, Everett Thomas [whoever he is], Skin, and Clarice [Blink?]."
5,Learning the Language of Faith,"Debra Rienstra presents a clear and engaging introduction to the Christian faith, equally helpful to the person raised in the church, who has perhaps heard but never explored the familiar ""language"" of the faith, and for the new Christian, for whom the language is unfamiliar. She combines theology with experience, engaging the reader's head as well as the heart, to help give the reader both a greater understanding of the faith, and a context in which to put their experience."
2,ear rings,when they say small - they mean tiny! they are about the size of an erase on the end of a pencil.
1,Disappointing,"I guess this is a case of you get what you pay for. The earrings are about 4 mm in diameter, and very cheap, the clasp doesn't fit back into the hole."
2,OMG,I didn't know they were so tiny. This item is for a baby. I wish the description would have clarified this...damn
2,Not Our Cup of Tea,My husband and I both like wasabi but .. we don't care for these crackers at all. The flavouring is a dusting on the cracker and it does have bite but to me it seems like a bitter non food chemical bite. Not like the wasabi we know.
5,Kame Rice crackers,"I love Kame Rice crackers. The wasabi are the best unless you ask my wife who prefers the original.Ka-Me Rice Crunch, Wasabi, 3.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)"
5,The Most Delicious crunchy snack ever!,These rice crackers are the most delicious pick me up with actual crunch and flavor. The plain rice crackers are excellent with cheese and whatever dip but these are great plain with lots of taste. (Less calories) TRY THEM! They will get soft if you don't seal them.
3,Good but dry.,Very in depth but quite dry. also it's kind of useless without the cd which is not included.That you must buy on your own.
1,Colloquial Italian,It's hard to evaluate as you folks have only the CD but not the book that is supposed to go with it. I am keeping my eyes open to find the book. I enjoy languages and really like the Colloguial series but I find having only the CD hard. It's curious to me that you would sell the CD but not the companion book.
4,"A Warm, Low-Key Love Story","This is a sweet and charming French movie. This is not the best move you have ever seem and there is not much action, but instead it is a charming, low-key love story of sorts that is well worth seeing. Germain is an illiterate, supposedly simple-minded, and somewhat shy handyman with a big heart; Margueritte is a kind old (95 years) lady who is losing her eye sight. They meet on a city park bench and begin to talk. Germain has been treated cruelty his whole life by a selfish mother who still survives. Germain believes he cannot read; actually, he can read but lacks the needed self-confidence. Margueritte begins to read to him -- The Plague by Camus -- and he is enthralled. With her as his catalyst, he makes slow steps toward self-esteem. For him, Margueritte becomes the caring and loving mother figure he never had and slowly he begins to love her as the mother he has always needed. The movie is in French with subtitles."
1,purchase of dvd My Afternoons with Margueritte,"This DVD comes from the States, which means it is prevented form being viewed on a TV set in the UK. I am very surprised that Amazon would sell a product that is not viable in the UKI would appreciate it if Amazon would reimburse me for this unusable productCarol Davies"
5,My Afternoons With Margaritte,"This movie is absolutely perfect. Uplifting and very, very spiritual. I have seen it in the theater and then I saw you had it for rental. I will probably buy the DVD soon."
2,Did not work for me,"I waited three months to give this product a fair shot. My skin did not peel to reveal new skin, my pores did not diminish, in fact it diminished the glow to my skin and dried it in spots. I will be returning to Olay products and probably get a professional peel."
5,Great book with lots of history and worthwhile information.,I found this book to be an excellent resource guide. It has invaluable information regarding all aspects of collectibles. I particularly enjoyed the authors humorous insight into various bands! BRAVO!
4,Glory Man United !!!,"This particular season shows all the desire, all it takes to be champions of England. Especially for Cristiano Ronaldo, who was hated by the country after World Cup for his ""theatrical act"" with Wayne Rooney. But two of them turns out to be the club's ""dynamic duo"". Who can forget the incredible 7-1 mauling versus AS Roma at OT ???. This is definitely one to own by all Man Utd fans all around the world..."
3,Dated but still useful,"This book and its illustrations are dated (check out the men at the rotary-dial telephones in actual phone booths and the occasional appearance of '70's fashions).However this is a very good guide to common human gestures, including the most subtle. I don't think you will find this much insight into and careful study of body movements which are often unconscious and which most people never think about.Can be useful for clinical practitioners, those who need to ""size up"" people and situations,people with Autism Spectrum disorders, and Martians."
3,How to Read a Person,This book left me with mixed feelings. I've read other books on the same subject and the information is old but it still works. Like the other books this was a fast and easy read. Again it is very useful if you're in sales. Always a helpful tool to have. This book will get you started and sharpening your sales skills. Always good to know when you can sell someone and when to give up.
1,terrible book,"You would be better off googling ""how to read body language"" and reading a couple paragraphs. Most of it is common sense or can be found in any magazine article. Save your money."
3,Fun for the Road,"This books was recommended by another Amazon reader. Has some good reviews but just didn't do it for me. Very Small book, not enough information for my taste. I browsed right through it in no time. If I were you I would go with something with more pages and more info. This book did make me realize that I already new most of the body language signs. My mistake.....I recommend a book on face reading."
2,A Book with Common Sense,"As a professor here in London University, this book is something to consider only if you have some left-over changes in your pocket or some extra money left on your account. With the cassette and the book i have purchased, the cassette lasts only 40 minutes and offers some common sense that everyone should have. However, you will find the book with more information and has a better value once you decide to spend the extra money you have."
3,Basic,"This is a very good book for beginners on how to understand body language ... but the division of the chapters, and some examples make this book very basic.very easy and fast to read"
3,Common Sense? or merely perceptive?,"This book is a decent introduction to body language. It is basic, and really won't shatter any of your preconceptions of how to read body language.If you consider yourself to be perceptive, or if you have studied other books on body language, you probably will not find anything earth-shattering or new here, but for a newbie, trying to pick up basics, this is a quick intro."
3,Buy an updated version,"The information presented is definitely valuable, though many of the situations are no longer applicable today. 20 years ago, people were allowed to smoke indoors, the word ""Indian"" to describe a Native American was acceptable and some ""ongoing research"" was still ongoing. Body language is virtually stayed the same, but I'm sure that new research out there could add tremendously to this already valuable wealth of information."
5,Very good informations,"I wish I would have had this book a long time ago. It really helps to get an idea of what the other person is thinking when you are talking with them. I have learned to watch for tell tale signs now, and I know when to shut up or perhaps take a different approach."
2,Common sense put in print,"While this book does cover some basic areas of behavior, it mostly deals with the common sense situations and stereotypes. Most of these tips you can glean from exaggerated TV situation comedies. It's only about a hundred pages, so borrow the book if you're really interested; it's not worth the money."
5,Quick crash course,This is the easiest crash course book into body language that is not too broad. An easy to read book for beginners is what to expect. There are not too many fancy words or over the top examples. This book is a great starting point for those who would like to learn about body language. There are better books for more in depth insight but for a quick crash course this reading will do.
4,Important Read,Well-written and easy to understand. It is a classic work in the field of education. Many of the tenets of this book are still appropriate for education today. Its short length makes it easy to recommend to busy teachers. Every American teacher should read this book!
2,Bruner Process of Education,Founding concepts are really dated now as Bruner himself seays in the latest preface. Useful for historic reasons but not for today's teaching needs.Amazon did an excellent job of delivery etc. Should probably not recommend it to those who buy Wong for example
2,Washington Capitals Rule -,"Nice shirt, quick delivery. However, the shirt was not true to size. It was too small for my son and he didn't get to wear it except twice. Therefore, if you want to order this shirt order a larger size than you need and don't dry it."
1,"Horrible, bitter taste","Maybe this product is really effective in treating UTIs, and if so, that's great. I didn't order it for that, so I can't evaluate its efficacy in that department. I ordered it (on the advice of a friend) to use as a candida-safe sugar substitute. I wish I hadn't. It is so unbelievably bitter, like really cheap stevia, but unlike stevia, you have to use a lot to get your food to taste ""sweet"". This product is so unappealing I cannot use it and wish I could return it."
2,"Bad songs, Lackluster performance","By far the weakest of Levon's solo albums. His vocals are still sure, but the anonymous backing and production are a far cry from the RCO All-Stars, let alone the Band. Plus the liner notes are annoying. If I have to hear Levon gripe about ""The Last Waltz"" again, I'll scream. What's he complaining about; his performances and interviews in the movie make him look like the coolest guy in the world! Stay with his other recordings, though."
2,Boring,"I realize the Zombies are not your high energy power band, but much of this was lamer than Moody Blues ""B"" tracks."
2,GREAT sound... not so great fit.,"These are the best sounding earbuds I have ever owned. They are also near the most uncomfortable set I have ever owned. Philips needs to do a bit more R&D; on the shape of these things. In their current form they are just too painful to use for extended periods of time (like over 30 minutes).If you are serious about good sound, follow the evolution of this product... but I would pass on the current version. Does it matter how good they sound if you can't keep them in your ears?"
3,Good for the price overall,"For the price, they're pretty good, sound-wise. BUT...only buy them if you are going to use them with a mp3 player or other audio device that has an adjustable Equalizer!! These buds come with naturally strong mid-range that needs to be turned down. I then turn up the trebles and basses to balance it out. THEN you'll have a great sound!Secondly, once you choose which size of the rubber covers to use (they have two, based on your ear hole size), I reccommend super-gluing it to the bud to make sure it doesn't yank off.I once was using these at the gym, got a weight caught on the wire, and it yanked the bud out of my ear, but left the rubber cover IN my ear. I had to use tweezers to pull it out. After gluing them ON to bud, I haven't had that problem again."
3,"not bad, not great","I bought these at best buy, my first impression was that they were awesome. I still think for the amount of money they are a pretty good deal. But my major complaint is that the fittings are easy to lose and can come off easy. I suppose if I could take better care I wouldn't have lost one of the fittings but they did seem to come off pretty easy. I guess I wish that they would have come with one or two replacements. I still think for the price if they could do something about the fittings buy making them stay on better and including a few spares, these are a great buy."
2,Terrible fit!,"I also bought these @ Target thinking it was a decent investment (for the $) to replace my worn down Sony headphones. TERRIBLE decision! I didn't think that you have to spend lots of $ to get quality headphones/earbuds, but I may have to rethink that assessment. These earbuds in no way fit into my ears and I tried multiple approaches. I even tried adding the extra silicone covers hoping that the extra bit of material could keep them in my ears, but no dice. Save taping them to my ears, there's nothing to be done with the terrible fit. Also, the ""asymmetric cabling system for wearing convenience"" (back of the box) was exceedingly annoying since it isn't adjustable. As a side note, the sound wasn't too bad, but since I was busy trying to grind the earbuds into my ears, I wasn't paying too much attention to it... Guess I'll be sheepishly returning to Sony..."
2,Average...until they broke,"I bought these at Target thinking they were a nice model for a low price. I admit the sound was pretty good. One reason they were bad thoughis that (i am not exaggerating on this) it took me SIX MONTHS to figure out how to keep them in secure. You have to sort of ""hook them"" into your ears from the back of your ear canal. They had good mids and the highs were great, but there was very little bass, which was important to me. Also, it reduces very little outside sound so it can get hard to hear if you are say, on a noisy airplane. And also after about 10 months, they broke. Sound stopped coming out of the left channel."
3,Amazing but...,"these head phones has amazing sound. I was using these on my ipod and i didnt even have to raise the volume to 1/2 way. Their the best to canceling noises while commuting. But theres a down side, the earbuds doesnt exactly fit right and when the 2 sets of silicone ear pieces are gone there are no replacements."
2,Great Sound/Nonfunctional Design,"The sound on these headphones is AWESOME--for the 30 seconds you're able to keep them in your ears. Users will find that the earbuds' conical-shape, combined with the rubber covers (you can't use the earbuds without these covers, because the metal will scratch your inner ear), allows these earbuds to constantly slip out of your ears. During a 30-minute walk, at least one of the buds (most often the left one, because of the asymmetric cabling system) must have slipped out of my ear every half-block. And the problem isn't just limited to wearing them during a workout, because they even slipped out of my ears while I was sitting at my desk. These are definitely going back to the store. (Same product as the HE591, just a different color)"
1,Don't fit in ears.,"I'm one of the folks who must have mutant ears, because there is no way I can comfortably wear these without them immediately falling out. I can shove them in my ears until they are painful, but just a slight head motion including talking will make them fall out. I don't recommend these at all. I must have tried dozens of earphones over my life and these are the first that don't fit.I ended up buying a Sony pair, which has poorer audio quality, but at least they stay in."
1,"Ridiculously uncomfortable, and bad sound","Steer clear of these terrible earphones.They have to be the most uncomfortable I have ever used. I can't use them for more than 20 minutes without my ears aching. That's if they manage to stay in that long - any slight movement and they fall out. The large round silver part prevents them from fitting into the ears properly. What size ears are they made for?The sound quality is mediocre, and the case is impossible to figure out! How this terrible product ever got past QA and into production I will never knowI've had them 2 days and I'm going to try as hard as I can to get my money back. My ears are sore!"
2,Mixed,"First of all, to all those who claim these things don't stay in - that may be true at first before your personal learning curve sets in. But anyone that legitimately has problems keeping them in doesn't know their ear from a septic tank. It's as simple as inserting and twisting.Second, the quality is not impressive. For anyone that just wants to listen to music, it's fine. And the volume is good. But the low-end wasn't as pleasing as I had been led to believe and everything else seems average as well.Third, the actual reason I dislike these earbuds rather than finding them pretty cool is because of the cord. The right earbud has three times more cord than the left and is not adjustable at all. I look like a cheap rip-off of Agent Smith with these things in. I'm almost too ashamed to go to the gym."
1,Adapter disappering,"I found these earbuds to be of a fair quality, My son and I both got a pair, however after a few months of use we had lost the plastic adapters and found that replacements are not available. I call Phillips and they could not help in any way, the service representative state it was a decision the higher ups had to make. The only solution they had is to buy a new pair. Which we will do, but not a Phillips brand."
1,Sounds like a clock radio.,"I am a bit picky when it comes to sound quality. These headphones have overpowering highs and NO bass at all. I have to turn the bass all the way up on my EQ on my MP3 player. Then it distorts. I am taking them back. They are worthless to me. I think I could get better sound quality from the no name 5 dollar ones. If you enjoy great sound for under 20 dollars. Try Koss ""The Plug"" thats what I had before and what I will go back to."
2,Sound...Meh...Design...Junk,"Sound is decent for the price. The design of the case, earbud size and everything else is just wonky. I will be returning mine and spending the extra cash to get a better pair."
3,"Good Sound, Poorly Engineered","I purchaced these earbuds as a replacement for the earbuds that came with my Sandisk E130 Mp3 Player. They sounded great, much better than the Sandisk earbuds. I didn't like the asymetrical length of the wires but eventually got used to it. The earbuds were comfortable and stayed in my ear even when I was lying down in bed. The bad news is that after only two month of fairly continuous use the left earbud went dead. No more sound output. Manipulating the wire would sometimes bring back the sound but the wires were clearly broken. At the price I paid they are somewhat replacable but I would be much happier if they lasted a bit longer. I will explore other earbuds before I purchace another pair of these earbuds."
2,Sound good but how to you wear them,They dont fit in my ear right. they can hang from the bottom of your ear(i think this is the idea) but then they dont sound so good (compired to in ear). i could deal with that if the left one would not fall out because of the weight of the cable.The carry case is novel at best.I think i will return them and get a pair which i could take running. or even walking. its a nice idea phillips. hang from the bottom of your ear idea is a good one but a little more r&d required
2,"Good sound, terrible design","I wanted to save money by buuying $20 earbuds, but I made the wrong choice. I was so excited when I bought them, but had trouble getting them in my ears and making them stay, and the HURT!!!! After a while I could'nt even put my regular earbuds in because my ears were so tender. The sound was great, but the design sucked."
1,Great Sound--Comfortable Fit--Want More Bass,(Oops! I meant to give this item 4 STARS!!)I lost the original pair of earbuds that came with my Rio Ce2100. I'd tried a couple of other pairs of earbuds and the sound quality was poor and the buds wouldn't stay in my ears.This pair is fantastic. I used to listen to my player on 20 I now listen to it at 8 - 10. I do notice that jazz does not sound as good as other styles of music through these buds.As other reviewers have mentioned the bass is a bit wanting. They fit well in my ears and have a larger set of cuffs for those with larger ear canals.Overall I love them.
1,"Great Sound, Horrible fit","Yes, the headphones do have great sound. Though what is great sound if you cant even get the headphones to stay in your ear. 5 stars for sound, NO stars for fit and for how uncomfortable they are."
1,These Head Phones Stink!,"These headphones are awesome until u put them in your ear.They have great sound and quality but u cant fit them in your ear ok, they fall out every 30 seconds! Especially if you run or jog they would fall out after it ried 2 put them back in! They made my ears so sore. What they say on the box is true they have great sound but the design is horrible!"
1,No two ways about it: these things suck,"The base response is nonexistent, as is the comfort. Yeah, they rovide different sleeves for them, but they all still depend on your ear canals to be the size of a dime. I actually found them more comfortable without the sleeves!The only thing they have going for them is the price and a decent chord length, and both of those can be found on the Skullcandy or Sony earbuds for the exact same price and much better sound quality. Avoid these things unless you have gone deaf from sticking loose change in your ears."
3,Poor Low End bt Comfortable,"I bought these because the idea of the ""Virtual SurroundSound"" sounded interesting. Well, the clarity of the high ends was fine but they delivered next to nothing on the low end. And even the mid-range was a bit lacking.A much better choice is the Koss Sparkplug. These are quite comfortable but even the Apple iPod earbuds that come with the iPod deliver a better full range of sound."
2,Too large for the average ear,"I bought these because I didn't want to spend $45 on the sony in the ear headphones. These would stay in to save your life! Even sitting, they just fall out!! Spend the extra $20 or so dollars."
4,Great sound-but hard to stay in,"I had a best buy gift card and was able to purchase a pair of the Philips HE592 earphones. I was pretty suprised by the results. I bought these for my ipod nano and I was snot dissapointed by the increase of bass and clarity. My one big cripe is the size fitting. Philips gives two sizes of fittings, but the largest size is way too small. I can't imagine how the small size must fit. The gold plated end creates higher clarity. The reflected speaker design that creates the virtual sorround sound is so so. It does an okay job to create a false sense of movement. I have read some complaints about lack of bass. If you want bass then you need powered headphones, better quality earbud or headphones, or non earbud head phones like Bose. These headphones can handle any bassline, but they do not increase the base. These are def a step up or two over the standard ipod earpuds."
3,Some issues,"I bought these headphones about 6 months ago at a best buy. The first time I wore these was on a plane ride from Chicago to Tokyo. The fitment was pretty terrible. Since I have small ears I could not get these to fit without some pain. After they were in the weight of the cord was an issue and kept pulling the left one out.Other than fittment issues the sound from this set is pretty good, the bass is lacking and the higher frequiencies are a little annoying. These are alot better than the set that comes with the Ipod but I am looking for a better set. I ordered a set of Sennheiser CX300B lst week and I should have them soon."
2,Ow,"I can't get these to fit in my ear canal without genuine pain, and even if I do, they won't stay in for long. For the few moments they're connected, the sound is better than the default iPod headphones... in fact, you can spin them around backwards and get better sound than iPod earbuds, but they won't stay in that way either.I wish I'd read the reviews here before buying them off the shelf. Due to the fit issue, they're simply unusable for me."
1,Terrible sound..,"I bought these headphones because the reviews from other users were so good. I am a studio/touring musician and have professional headphones that I use for studio recordings, but I need a cheap pair that sounds almost as good for the road. I have been looking for a cheap pair of good headhphones to replace my 10 year old Sony E-808V that I got for $10. The Sony E-808V blows these headphones away in treble response, bass response, and even in surround-sound capability. The bass is non-existent, and the treble sounds like you're listening in a cardbox box. With all the great reviews, I thought these would be replacements for my Sony E-808V but I was very wrong."
2,Sound GREAT! But the PAIN!,"These earbuds sound FANTASTIC! Some of the best sounding earbud headphones I have ever heard. great bass & highs. But unfortunately they won't stay in my ears without falling and after awhile of messing with them my ear canals became very sore. Maybe I have abnormal ears, but I don't think so. I bought these for use at the gym while on the treadmill, and for that purpose they are useless. They would only stay in if I kept perfectly still, even then they would work themselves out after a few minutes. I gave it 2 stars because of the sound."
3,"Sound pretty good, not very comfortable","I bought these at Target in the iPod accessories section. I was looking for something that sounded better than the headphones that came with my iPod and these looked interesting. Im very happy with the sound quality, but they aren't very comfortable. They fit just fine in my ears and don't fall out by themselves, but they just put too much pressure on the walls of my inner ear. There has to be a way for Phillips to make these more comfortable."
3,"An improvement, but...","I bought these as a replacement for earbuds I received with my MP3 player (not an Apple product). I experienced the same thing as one of the reviewers below - after continuous use, the left earbud went dead. ""No more sound output. Manipulating the wire would sometimes bring back the sound but the wires were clearly broken... I would be much happier if they lasted a bit longer."" Granted, I had mine for about a year before that happened, but it was also the left earbud with me and as a lefty, I found this very annoying!! I was quite content with my earbuds up till that point, and had been considering replacing them with the black version for vanity reasons -- the white ones were getting dirty and I just prefer black ones overall (they weren't available when I first shopped for these). If I am guaranteed at least two years' use out of a pair of black ones, I would gladly repurchase these."
4,Great surround sound at a small price.,"I was intrigued by the idea of 'surround sound' in an earbud and bought them at best buy. Well, they really do have GREAT sound and surround sound -- even better than some of my more expensive headsets. I use them at night to listen to a customized subliminal affirmation disk I am using to reprogram my subconscious, as well as to music. They have EXCEPTIONAL SOUND.The downside is the stupid asymmetrical design of the cord. I don't know if this was done for the surround sound or not but it is a pain and detracts from the product. i threw the case away -- useless and too hard to use. I transport mine in a plastic sandwich bag. I hope they improve on the flaws mentioned here. If they did I would gladly buy another pair."
4,great alternative to noise cancelling,"just got these, and not sure about the surround sound, but they are by far the best ear buds i've tried for noise reduction without spending the dollars."
4,"Good sound, painful fit","I got these earbuds for my birthday and started listening with them today. So far I like the sound quality, though I haven't tested it thoroughly. Voice is nice and clear. Bass is solid. These headphones are louder than the last pair I had, so I had to drop the volume slightly. I think I must have small ear canals, because these fit so tight they hurt. Though I haven't been running around in them or anything, they stay in just fine. One other reviewer mentioned that you get used to the uncomfortable fit, so I am hoping for that. But these are good for the price."
4,"Terrific sound, a bit flimsy","I've bought two pairs of these earbuds. They have the best sound of any I've tried, but unfortunately one of the supposed features - namely, the right earbud cord is longer than the left, so you can share with a friend, gets in the way and contributes to catching it on things. This, coupled with the thinness of the cord, has led me to considering other options as my second pair has now gone out in one ear. The break is inside the earbud - if I twist the cord around tight enough, it makes contact again and I can hear, but it is impossible to fix.I always get a couple months, at least, of service out of them, and have no problem with the fit of the earbuds, so I got my money's worth, but I am old fashioned/frugal enough to want what I buy to last damn near forever.Recommended, with caveat."
3,I had to modify these,"These kept falling out of my ears, so I got a cheap ear bud set from the 99Cents store with over-the-ear hooks that I cannibalized and adapted for my Phillips HE92.Problem solved."
2,"good idea, poor sound","i love the around the neck asymetrical cord. having grown up in japan, where this set up was very common, i'm glad to have it. sound is kinda crisp, but very little bass. van halen sounds ok, but black eyed peas sounds wimpy. and the little rubbery thing falls off pretty easily, already lost one for good. it's key to the sound quality, now mine sounds real bass-less."
4,Great sound for the Money,"Just got these today. They sound great! And for 20$ just about everywhere you can't go wrong. As a previous consumer noted they come with a one size fits all silicone bud, so these may not fit everyone. But probably most people. I am jammin' with them right now. Kickin!!!! They have enough base to vibrate my eardrum. I don't care for the wrap around the head feature. Otherwise no complaints.The earbuds that came with my IPod were just OK. For working out I use some sport Sony earphones. Check these ear buds out."
3,Eh,"I bought my set to match my new iPod Shuffle (of course) since the stock earphone hurt my ears so much. I've been fairly disappointed with this product. The soft bits that actually go in my ear keep falling off of the drivers, and the whole lot keeps on falling out of my ear. So far I haven't lost any of the ear cushions, but it is only a matter of time.But the sound quality is acceptable for the money and the buds are comfortable when they're actually staying in place.Overall, I would skip this product."
3,Overhyped Doesn't Deliver,"This Philips headphone was in the iPod section at my local Target. It had a little tag on it saying it got a International CES Innovations Award for ""Design & Engineering Showcase Honors"" at the 2004 in Las Vegas. Now that's a huge show so I thought these headphones had to be good. The package even said it had patented surround sound design. What I wanted was some kind of bass response from these tiny headphones and what I got was no bass at all. Also, the pitch sounded kind of cheap. These cost $19.99 and I ended up getting better Philips headphones that only cost $9.99 and have a clip that goes around your ear so it doesn't fall out during workouts."
1,horrible fit,"They sound incredible, but don't stay in your ear unless you really shove them in there. Then it feels like bamboo under the fingernails.I don't understand how this design made it out to the public.The bad news is that my wife threw out the box before I decided to give up on them - now I'm stuck."
1,POOR SOUND QUALITY,My original SANSA earbuds blow these away. Muddy sounding. Back to the store they go.
1,Stick with the ones your iPod came with,"These were a complete waste of $20. They are so terrible that I've gone back to the ones that came with my iPod. They are comfortable, but the sound is not worth it. I'm not even a sound-snob - just an average person."
2,yeah they kinda suck,So I needed a replacement for my stock ipod ear buds and these appeared better. Found out that they are uncomfortable and don't stay in. Also if you're wearing a winter hat then they fall out. The sound quality was nice but the impractical design makes them utterly useless. Do more research before you buy this item.
2,Kit comes up short.,The kit promises tail and side lights. It came with only the tail lights. They are fine and easy to install but I needed the amber sides. The picture and the product discription are not correct.
4,Half And Half,"As an Lp this record's Side 1 consist's of Danny Whitten penned tunes except for one song co-written by Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. Side 2 are song's penned by the Whitsell brother's. There's a definite distinction in the quality and type of song's between Side's 1 and 2., with Whitten's song's getting my nod for being the superior tune's. That being said, my absolute favorite cut on this collection is the Leon Whitsell tune ""I Won't Alway's Be Around"". Whitten, Talbot and Molina providing superb neo-doo wop chop's that recall their original group Danny And The Memories. The rest of the album is a Pschedelic-Garage-Band-Crash-Pad-Hippie-product of it's time. L.A.'s orange sunshine in the late sixtie's."
5,Great sole album release,"The Rockets were together from the start then changed the name to Crazy Horse, and went through quite a few line-up changes. With just the bass, and drummer remaining. After-all this is the backbone of any band, isn't it?"
2,"Great Seller, But Software Doesn't Work With VISTA","I bought this software because Family Tree Maker reviews indicated the latest FTM software (made to run with vista) wasn't nearly as good as the earlier Version 16. FTM does offer a Vista patch that's supposed to make Version 16 work with vista. While the software will run, the function that lets you export a family tree diagram to .pdf format causes the software to crash. FTM tech support was great to work with, but after 5 or 6 attempts, they still haven't found a way to make version 16 run on my new vista machine. The software does run just great on XP, and the vendor who sold this product to me was excellent. The only problem is the fact that FTM's vista patch doesn't fix everything it's supposed to fix. I'd buy FTM version 16 again if I didn't have vista. I'll go back to XP or buy a Mac before I buy any new PC with vista or 7."
1,Useless,Made a mistake when I purchased this program. Repeatedly removed and re-installed the program with the same result: FTM desktop with error message 'it could not find files'. This was the only advice FTM tech support could offer. Lesson learned; I'll just use a spreadsheet and make my own 'Tree.'Paul Kellogg
4,Family Tree Maker Version 16 Standard [OLD VERSION],"Works well thus far, will do more work with it this winter, so really difficult to tell right now."
5,These are the best mouse pads ever. Says me! :),"Of all the mouse pads I've seen and tried, 3M makes the best. They're super-high resolution, due to the surface (for old style ball mice), and have an excellent pattern for optical mice. What really sells me on these are two things: the smooth easy way that mice slide across the 3M mouse pad surface on their Teflon pads, and the low profile of the pad. Since this pad is super-thin, it doesn't raise the mouse to an uncomfortable (or anti-ergonomic) height. So you hardly notice you're using a ""mouse pad."" The backing surface helps it stay put on most work spaces. And best of all - the small, thin size makes it ideal to take along with a wireless notebook mouse. It carries my highest recommendation. And the price is good, too."
3,Decent mouse pad,"If you haven't noticed it's a textured mouse pad, meaning the top surface isn't smooth. It works pretty well with my optical mouse and handles routine pc stuff fine. I wanted to use it to improve my perfomance on some games, but it hasn't been optimal for that use. It's a little too small for gaming and it's backing doesn't hold it in place, so it slides around on my desk unless I anchor it in place with something heavy."
1,Crap,"Does not work at all with the Apple Wireless Optical Mighty Mouse (I know, unbelievable that a mouse pad does not work, how hard is it???).I returned it."
3,Not what I thought ...,"I bought this, since I had it's predecessor, and the sticky backing got ""unsticky"". I was a little disappointed, since it was not as compact (my older one was smaller and rectangular), and could not stick to the underside of my laptop. I am a mobile on-site Apple IT Consultant, and sometimes I go to clients where they have desks and surfaces that need a mouse pad, like glass. If anyone finds something like what I'm asking, please email macnrg@mac.com.I think I'm going to try the WOW pad."
5,"Works well, great price","I was having problems with my cursor moving randomly around the screen, and I realized that with an optical mouse I would need a more precise mouse pad surface than the old neoprene one I had. This was the best price I found on this type of mouse pad. It's very thin, so I laid it on top of the old mouse pad, which also keeps it in place better since the back doesn't seem to have a lot of grip. The 3M surface is easier to keep clean than the neoprene, and my cursor is no longer ""possessed""."
2,"Works well, but steer clear!","The mouse pad does not look as nice as it does on the photo - it is actually rather dull and cheap-looking. I cannot complain about performance as tracking is very good. However, and I can't believe no-one has mentioned this in earlier reviews, it smells absolutely horrid! The smell is hard to describe - like new plastic, but also like musty towels and sweaty gym-shoes! Totally gross...."
2,not like the 3M blue pad,"The surface is fine, it's the backing that's a problem. It's made out of some vinyl material that slides around on my desk. Not good."
2,Too thin and floppy,"I gave this one away too. It was larger than what I needed, and was thin and unstable when using it."
1,This pad sucks,Too small. The pad glides all over the desk because of the completely ineffective 'grip' on the bottom. There are much better options out there. Try the ones from Handspring. They rock - also cheaper. Don't waste your time or money with this one.
3,Does the job but not a slam dunk,"I just wanted a cheap and easy mousepad that would work well with my laser mouse. This fits the bill just fine and I like the look of it. However, like the other reviewers stated, it slides around on your desk. Luckily I have a little raised edge where my keyboard and mouse go so I can brace the bottom of the pad against that to stop the movement. If you're going to play games or do something with a lot of quick movements, you may want to get something else but for browsing the net and normal work, it should fit the bill."
3,A Real Slider,"While this is a very attractive and very sensitive mouse pad, it tends to slide around a lot. Even when I tried to fix it in place with doublesided tape, this still occurred. So in some ways it may my work easier, but in other ways it just proved annoying."
1,This mouse pad slides,"I bought this and on the first day was looking for some glue to keep it from sliding around on my formica desktop. When it slides the mouse pointer won't move reliably; pretty much defeats the purpose of having a mouse pad. Even with the pad glued down (yes, I glued it down to my desk) I found it to be too small when using a large monitor."
3,"Great on top, lousy down below","If I could give this product 2.5 stars, I would. I've given it the benefit of the doubt and rounded up to three.I wanted a thin but effective mouse pad because using my optical mouse directly on my desk surface has started to wear down the soft plastic glide pads under my expensive mouse. I bought this pad hoping to extend the life of my mouse by using it on a surface designed for just such a thing.The top of the mouse pad works great. The mouse glides smoothly and effortlessly over the surface and my optical mouse tracks well.The underside of this pad is far too slick however ... the mouse pad slides just as easily along the surface of my desk as the mouse does over the pad itself. I've been forced to put a mug on the corner of the pad to hold it in place ... thus chopping off the amount of area available for the mouse. I suspect it would stay in place with some double sided tape but am frustrated as I dont want to have to do that."
1,heretis,Thought I was getting the 3rd Edition. What I received was the 1st. Not happy. Already had the 1st. So this was a waste of time and money.
5,The perfect balance to The World is Flat,"If you're going to India and you want to prepare for your experience, this easy-reading book gives you a feel for the culture and things you'll see. A business person can benefit from the anecdotes that demonstrate, while the world may be flatening, it's just not as simple as that. A beautifully written work with some LOL stories from real life."
4,Sharp has to be emptied twice a day.,My mother in law has this and we are now emptying it twice a day.The unit stops and will not run until it is emptied.It is very hot and humid and I don't know if the water is not being evaporatedand filling up the internal container (ie there is a problem with it) orif it is so humid the water cannot be expelled fast enoughout the exhaust and the internal container is filling.I hope it is the latter.
1,Single Hose Portables DONT WORK!!,"Pro: Elegant (somewhat quiet) MachineCon: Must pull hot air from outside in order to function.The problem with these single hose portables is they cool the super high temp condenser coils with air from the room and then spit it out through a window via the hose. Problem with that: Where does the air come from to REPLACE the air going out the hose? FROM THE HOT AIR OUTSIDE! (Through cracks and crevices around windows and doors, if it's an air tight room the a/c will overheat and shut off.)Ridiculous, it's constantly fighting a losing battle. You'll need 2x the BTUs to do what a window unit does. And just wait till you get your electric bill!Get a window unit instead. If you don't have a appropriate window you can have a 'through the wall' unit installed or look into 'mini-splits' or go all out and get central air.Good luck and stay cool,J"
2,The sopranos season 5,I understand it was a used copy but the disks were in bad shape and it wasn't even a case for the set I wasn't real happy at all.
2,Disappointing Packaging,"The Sopranos is still one of my favorite shows of all time. I'd give IT five stars. I loved the fifth season. Yet, I do feel these boxed sets leave something to be desired. The flap cover opening face makes it difficult to shelve them. Stacking them on top of each other is no good. Side by side's okay as long as you bookend them. And don't get me started on the ribbon bullcrap. Add to that the fact that there is very little extra content, and all in all this release of boxed sets offers very little for collectors. For those interested in a one time viewing the resale or trade in value is almost nonexistent. Frankly if I had it to do over again I'd just purchase them used--though likely not here cause the merchants have them overpriced--watch them, sale/give them to a friend or family member and wait for a true collectors edition to come out."
4,Fast shipper,Fast shipper as described Fast shipper as described Fast shipper as described Fast shipper as described . . . . . .v.v.v. . . . . . Fast shipper as described . . . . . . . . . . . . ;4
4,"Twice the pistol, half the gun.","A tutto c'è rimedio, fuorchè alla morte.There is a cure for everything except death. There is plenty to go around in season 5!"
4,An unwanted end,"The Sopranos Fifth season was pretty good,although it left me looking for more.the season ends in a spot that don't give you all the answers that you look for in ending."
2,Flawed disc,"This product came in seemingly perfect condition, both in packaging and in quality, until I reached the final two episodes. At least 25 minutes is completely unwatchable. I tried it on several DVD devices, including traditional players and laptop and pc drives. Very disappointing."
4,A Welcome Return,"Definately a welcome return from the slow pace of the Fourth Season. The Fifth Season made me wanting more instead of wondering if the show had ""Jumped the Shark.""Eventhough I liked it, the Meadow & Fiance episode was a little drippy.Stick to what works...crime and getting away with it, rubbing out enemies and cheaters prospering!"
3,Dionaea Muscipula,"Any life, no matter how long and complex it may be, is made up of a single moment- the moment in which a man finds out, once and for all, who he is...""Jorge Luis Borges""I have one share in corporate Sopranos, and I am nervous about the management. Every creator of this series painfully experiences the chasm between his inner vision and its ultimate expression. The theme and the objective of the series have to be scrubbed off every once in a while, or the light won't come in. As ""Moliere"" said :""It is not only for what we do that we are held responsible, but also for what we do not do.""We are cups, constantly and quietly being filled. The trick is, knowing how to tip ourselves over and let the beautiful stuff out. Draw a crazy picture, Write a nutty poem, Sing a mumble-gumble song, Whistle through your comb, Do a loony-goony dance, 'Cross the kitchen floor, Put something silly in the Series, That ain't been there before."
4,The Goombas Are Back In Town: WARNING - SPOILERS,"Time to stuff your face with pasta and wave your hands around when you talk, dropping an F-Bomb every other word - the long anticipated season 5 of the Sopranos is finally available on DVD to satisfy America's love affair with the mafia and pretending to be Italian.Now here comes the shocker: you may have already heard this, but Season 5 reveals to us that Tony Soprano is Darth Vader's father. Also, the five families get together and put a hit on Meadow - putting US all out of our misery. Thank GOD. Junior gets a prescription for Viagra - and the best of all: Janice dies from choking, due to stuffing her face with a 96 ounce steak. Nobody has the physical strength to remove her fat @ss, so she's buried right there in Artie's restaurant.The cover of this set - inspired by scenes from Dante's Inferno - was a horrible choice. It really bugs me. I hope season 5 is good. Haven't seen it yet, so don't spoil it for me."
1,Crook,"Do not place any orders that involves this seller. He will not respond to your emails, and you will receive nothing."
5,5 STARS NOT ENOUGH:.WARNING SPOILERS,"THE FIFTH SEASON OF THE SOPRANOS IS PROBABLY THE SECOND BEST SEASON,WITH THE BEST BEING THE FIRST SEASON.THIS SEASON HAS THE RELEASE OF UNCLE TONY,WHO IS TRYING TO GET HONEST WORK BUT THEY JUST RIDE HIM SO MUCH THAT HE FINALY GETS INTO THE LIFE.ALSO IN THIS SEASON YOU SEE JOHNNY SACK BECOME HEAD MAN IN THE NY GANG,AND BECOMES A MAJOR PAIN IN TONYS LIFE.BUT THE MAIN SHOCK OF THE SEASON WAS ADRIANNA GETTING WACKED.I MEAN WAS ANYONE READY FOR THAT.NOT ME,BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN ON THE SHOW FROM THE BEGINNING.TO BAD,I WILL MISS HER.I JUST HOPE SEASON 6 IS AS GOOD.THIS IS JUST A CLASSIC SHOW.IF YOU DON`T HAVE THIS,YOU CAN BUY WITH CONFIDENCE."
5,Don't miss this show!,"Season 5 of the Sopranos brings about some exciting changes and developments for many of the characters. It is entertaining and enthralling to watch. It kept me up late at night, just to watch ""one more episode"". Yes, officially addicted.What I enjoy about the Sopranos is that each season they bring about some new characters, most of which are great ""villians"". It keeps the show fresh and interesting. Here we meet Tony's cousin, played by Steve Buscemi.I can't say enough good things about this series, but as I'm reviewing all 6.2 seasons right now, I guess I am running out of original things to say for each. But I just wanted to take the time and add my opinion for each so that each prospective viewer can add my vote to the count that says ""Don't miss this show!"""
1,Don't buy this poorly mastered CD,"Like so many I purchased this poorly mastered CD due to the fact Bobby Helms ""Jingle Bell Rock"" has become the defacto pop Christmas song.However, after listening to this piece of crap it's my opinion Bobby should be ashamed of himself. You can hear just how poorly mastered this crap is with your own ears. It's like listening to muffled speakers. Being so dissappointed with the quality of this CD I ran some utilities on this CD only to discover 86% of this CD is analog quality.Mr. Helms needs to go back to the study with new qualified sound engineers and re-release a new quality product.Don't waste your hard earned money on this garbage... it's a rip off."
5,"Great music, great performance, great sound.","This is one great alblum. Great upbeat music. Every song is great. Recording is just about perfect...except a bit heavy on bass. On a high detail sound system, it sings!"
3,"Good, but not as good as the first two...","I'm a die-hard Jeffrey Gaines fan -- have been following him since 1980's. I loved the first two albums, but had a hard time getting into this one...just doesn't seem to be a lot of new creativity to me. I mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to Jeffrey's music. She felt the same way until she saw him in concert doing the new stuff, and said it clicked then for her."
5,The Who Brothers?,"I just heard the Bacon Brothers in concert last night. Jeffrey Gaines opened for them (minus his band who were all home with their sweethearts for Valentine's weekend). Grimes stole the show. His talent was readily apparent, and his lyrics were nothing short of soulful. I was gald to happen upon his performance by accident. I bought the Galore CD, and it's great."
1,Jeffrey Gaines or Johnny Lang?,"I just heard ""In Your Eyes"" on the radio. I swear to you I was convinced it was Johnny Lang, only unplugged :o) That was until the DJ on the radio said it was JG. Well, I was so mad the stupid DJ cannot even get his artists straight...it's only HIS JOB. Needless to say I was wrong. I came home and looked up JG on the net and sure enough here I am... and I think I'll pick up a CD :o)"
4,Amethyst Review,"In all of the 4 of the books from this series, the women were either running from something or trying to find out who they were. I so admired how Amethyst did not remain in the belief that she was less than. Yes, she was sent on a trip and did not purpose to find out who God thought that she was, but she took advantage of where the Lord brought her and what He brought in her path. Remember, readers, YOU ARE God's treasure, and YOU ARE loved as a precious child of God. He DOES HAVE a plan for you!!"
5,loved,i relley like the ook thier is no cussing and it was very real i would recamend it to everybody
5,toon townie,Book arrived on time in in good condition. I plan to read the series during my vacation. Thanks!
5,Dakota Treasures possibilities,"What can I say except that I love Lauraine Snelling's work. As with all the other series she has done I want them to go on forever. I would especially like to see some more of these maybe Sapphire,Diamond or Garnet."
5,enjoyable,I really enjoyed this book. I stayed interested until the very end. I wish there were more books in this line.
5,Dakotah Treasures,I Have read all 3 so glad there is another one can't wait to get number 4 I enjoy her books so much hope there is number 5 In Portland ORThank You Barbara
2,not worth reading,"I've been reading the Dakota treasures series, and though the first two books were good this one and Opal were just torture. They could have been condensed into one book, though I had a hard time finding a point to either book. Amethyst's story was mostly description of the the land and hardly had anything to do with her. I would not recommend this book, though I do the first two."
3,Fourth in the series Dakota Treasures,"I truly believe the first 3 books were much superior to this one, but there were some good things here, too. Amythyst leaves her less than honorable father to go searching for a lost nephew only to have a huge surprise. In the meantime, she decides to stay in the Dakota territory with folks she comes to love. She goes to work, rides out the horrible winter, makes friends and falls in love. However, is the love going to be returned? An unlikely meeting with rich Mrs. Grant had changed the course of her life. Eventually the two women start an enterprise and the book sort of ends with the final love stories' climax."
1,Don't but this book,"Lack necessary information need for the exam. Very redundant. okay for beginners, but don't waste your time reading more than the first three chapters. Do not use this as primary preparation for the exam. I passed with a 554, but thats all thanks to the transcender corp. Bottom line: exchange is huge and this book leaves out important CHAPTERS of information. Any book that claims to prepare for an exam should have some sort of discussion all topics that you will tested on, whether it be detailed or brief. This book did not do that. I've used IDG publications to study for other tests and liked them but they really disappointed me with this one."
1,"Does not go far enough, nor prepare you for test","The book misses some critical areas that are tested heavily. Most obvious area: TCP/IP Ports and firewalls. MS tests that! This book ignores it. It is also a little weak in areas such as trusting relationships, ES admin permissions, and backup strategies.The NT 4.0 (For Server, Enterprise, and WS) book from this series (Author: Carter) was one of the best MCSE book made, so this one was a dissapointment."
2,This is not a good book for MCSE Exchange Server 5.5,"I bought this book because I got discount on it. It does not cover TCP port at all. I read it for more than a week and then sat for exam. Luckily, I just passed the exam at score 494. If you rely on this book for the exam, you might have a great chance to get failed."
5,"Tough Read, Worth the Trouble","Some serious food for thought here. Not only is the power to define madness, criminality, and sexuality addressed, but also the active use of criminals, and sex, to suppress and subjugate the populace. Somewhat more difficult to wade through but similar to Norman Cousins, it helped provoke my thinking on how top-down unilateral command based on secrets is inevitably going to give way to bottom-up multicultural decision-making by the people based on open sources evenly shared across networks. This is really very heavy stuff, and it helps call into question the ""rationality"" of both the Washington-based national security policymaking process, and the ""rationality"" of spending $30 billion a year on secrets in contrast to what that $30 billion a year might buy in terms of openly-available insights and overt information peacekeeping."
4,"More instrumentals, less vocals, less satisfying","Skiffle-bop was a little bit disappointing to me for a couple reasons. First of all, it's about half instrumentals, and while I like Williams' instrumentals immensely, I was hoping for more vocal tracks, because I love his voice.Second, his cover of the overlooked Sam Phillips/T-Bone Burnett track ""Libera Me"" was extremely disappointing. It sounds way too happy for the lyrical content. Plus, he says ""me"" as if he were referring to himself, as opposed to ""may"", which would be correct for the Latin phrase. Maybe I'm picking too much.This is his first album with vocals where the instrumentals have been much more memorable than the vocal tunes. ""Weary of the Moon"" is a real gem, but besides the above-mentioned ""Libera Me"", it's the only vocal track that makes an impression. I'll play it, but not as much as ""Seven Sisters"",""Knife Edge"", or ""Hundred Year Shadow."""
4,Skiffle Bop Rocks for a Folk Album,"I saw Brooks Williams in nearby Hightstown, NJ. He packed a small venue, much too small for his considerable talents. He is supposed to be a folk artist, but he plays a lot of other kinds of riffs. The songs have lyrics worth listening to. Some written by him, some by others. I recommend this album, and that you see him in concert."
4,Martyred Mister George,"This album is charmingly diverse, containing dance mixes such as No Clause 28, a ballad or two, and of course the odd silly cut like One On One. Best by far is Bow Down Mister, his Indian excursion (which recalls early Culture Club's excellent cultural mix) where the exuberant sitar-filled sound is infused with a deep spiritual quality through the voice of the great Indian chanteuse Asha Bhosle. What a happy marriage of East and West - here the twain have met and fallen in love. It was great to see the return of this colorful creature in the early 1990s with this new line in sound."
4,boy george does it rite,well what can be said for boy georges recording under a different namethe beatss n bass work well throughout the album and the lyrics just speak for themselveshope u enjoy this piece
4,Another excellent book from McKinzie,"The main character is a very conflicted Wyoming state drug enforcement officer, trying to stay out of trouble, but always being in the middle of the turmoil. Climbing is his release but also an integral part of the story line. The books are well written with interesting plot twists, and he writes about climbing so well that you are with him on every pitch."
2,McKinzie has run out of line!,"Very disappointing follow up to ""Crossing the Line"". Depressing actually.Since McKinzie has gone on haitus for the past 5 years its easy to see thathis creative spark is GONE! This book leads us down the dreary path of lossafter loss after loss directed at Antonio Burns, with seemingly no hope ofrecovery. And thats how we are left, with a defanged lone wolf with no badge,no friends, and no better half.Trust me, if you have just discovered this series and are, or think you area fan, do NOT read this book. Its terrible."
4,A Basic Four Star Read,"As I've noted in other reviews of this series, these books are solid 4 star offerings featuring Antonio Burns, a rock climber by avocation and an investigator by vocation. The books are well written, generally interesting, mostly believable and Burns is a guy you root for to get his personal life in order so that he can have a love life. He blows more relationships than most of us could even hope to start. These are books that you read when you want to spend some time outdoors in rural America; kind of a change of pace from places like Los Angeles or Detroit. They are worth reading."
3,missing text,"Others have noted the bad OCR job, but this version is also just plain missing text. Whenever one of the characters quotes something, like a piece of poetry or Greek text, the quote is just entirely missing."
4,Eloquent and Moving,"Don't really have time for a long, in-depth review, but I'll hit my major point. Never before have I read such poignant, eloquent prose. Every word carries meaning; there's no excess, pointless pasages. As to the actual tale, I enjoyed it excessively. Romantic in its own way, but even better it presents the insecurities and trials of actual people. Nothing is smoothed over or romanticized. That gives it a flavor of originality. As to which version to get....in this case it doesn't really matter, since there's no translations, but I was very impressed with the Barnes and Nobles version. The notes and introduction were excellent in their explanations. Since I haven't gotten the Peguin Classics edition or the Oxford edition I can't say which is superior, but the B&N was satisfactory. Anyways, very pleased with my buy, and I hope to read more of Woolf's work.....I think Night and Day is the next one on my list!"
5,Perfect edition!,"Perfect edition! This is a charming, and totally wonderful edition, if you are ordering the Voyage Out with the charming cover of the painting, you will be very happy."
2,Not Her Best Work,"I enjoy reading most of VW's work, but this one just eludes me. Overly long, very repetitious and at times quite boring, it was all I could do to finish it. The dialogue is something right out of a late Henry James novel....no one could possibly have conversations these characters do. And why the sad death of Rachel? What point does it serve? Somehow I think VW was trying to out Austen Jane Austen and failed."
1,Fingernails on blackboard with Yoko Ono vocal,Regretfully purchased this CD. Makes a nice candle holder. Or give it to someone you do not like. It is that bad. Sorry.
5,Great but overpriced,"Two things taught me to write: this book and reading a lot of CS Lewis. Both will give you a lesson in the key to good communication -- verbs. Most technical reports use a form of ""to be"" as the verb in almost every sentence.Stop it!"
4,Easy to understand,"If you are looking to revise business prose this book is really good with explaining the process step by step. It is in plain english, no big words you will need to look up.It is also fun to read."
2,Stilted,"Revising Business Prose was recommended to me by a co-worker. When not presenting examples of concise writing, Richard Lanham writes with a slow, stilted style, antithetic to his own recommendations. While instructing readers not to overwrite, he overwrites.I won't even talk about the chapter, ""Who's Kicking Who?"" O! Wait a moment. I just did. He defends his misuse of the subject, ""who,"" in place of the object, ""whom,"" by claiming ""whom"" sounds stilted. So, it is OK for him to employ idiomatic language and yet write a book criticizing the same. At almost $0.35 per page ($40 MSRP/117 pages), I don't see the value."
3,I needed stronger,"I am only 30 and only have a few fine lines, but after using this for almost 3 months have not noticed a difference. I previously used ROC night cream and though that broke me out a little bit while I got use to it, I definitely noticed a difference. I have heard great things about afirm, I just started with too low. Next time I will chose 2x, maybe 3x. Unless you have really sensitive skin, I wouldn't order the 1x, go with the higher dose for more effectiveness."
1,Caused Breakouts,"This is the first over the counter retinol cream I have used. I did a lot of research beforehand by reading reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley. This retinol cream did NOT work for my skin. It caused acne and another red spot on my chin that has been there for over two months and will not go away. It caused a huge blemish on my chin and I now have a scar there. It has been there since July so I am worried it is now a permanent scar. I am now stuck with almost an entire tube of this product that I paid over $40 for. The money isn't a big deal, but a permanent scar on my face is what has me really worried."
1,No visible results,"After applying it for 2 weeks,my eye area looks the same.It does not do anything for the lines at all."
5,"Finally an IT book I can call ""Great""","Interesting, technically sound, a great intro to BeOS but goes deeper, too. The addition of interviews with Be inc. employees and other interesting bits (like the part about BeBox) are the cherry on top of this masterpiece. I think bundling The BeOS Bible with BeOS was a great idea.I'm eagerly looking forward for any books on Be, written by Scot Hacker."
5,A superb guide to a superior desktop OS,"There may not be any other books (yet) on BeOS for users, but once you buy this you really won't care. This book is truly superb! Approachable for the novice, yet full of useful info and features for the more technically inclined - much like BeOS itself. Hacker's writing is clear, witty and never bores the reader. If you have *any* interest in BeOS you'll want this book!"
4,A well organized and useful guide to BeOS,"This book is an excellent, well organized guide to BeOS. It is easy to read and includes many helpful examples when topics become complex. The interviews are a nice touch too. The only thing I would do to improve this book is to replace the ""only of interest to programmers"" comments with actual information (since I am a programmer). Otherwise is was superb - I was completely engrossed for over 700 pages."
5,Very good,"I have read this book and it's very good. I started using BeOS for few months ago and if I had not baugt this book I would not been able to use BeOS as well as I do now. :) I give it 5 stars because if you start reading it you can't stop reading it, and it is very educational."
4,True Sadness Comes Someday,"Fortunately, the world does not simply become ""whatever we think it is"", as the reviewer below assumes. If that were true, there would be no illness, old age or death, nor any reason for this gem of a book. As Hiroyuki says, ""Some things just don't work; some things just can't be done."" These are not words that some people are ready to hear in our ""new age"" of self help, positive thinking and ""self power"". But as he points out, ""Long ago people used to describe life as a long, long journey on which we all carry a very heavy load. The passage of a mere three or four centuries isn't going to change the reality of human experience.""If you have ever felt that life has no meaning; if you have ever thought ""there is nothing I can do""; if you have always suspected that ""willpower"" was a sham, then this book will be a friend to you. Written like a great dinner conversation, full of digressions, this book is a deep well of humanity and compassion."
3,A refreshing perspective,"Very interesting perspective,refreshing in the sense that the authour follows a direction in life that is very much reflected in negativity.While there's enough 'positive' thinking books out there saturating readers,Hiroyuki takes reader through a much more realistic and practical outlook on life.Though some of his opinions left very much to be desired,this book is meant to be honest and it was."
3,A chance to hear the Byrds in SACD - but MONO??,I really am enjoying hearing these high quality releases of music in DVD-A and SACD. But this is an odd offering in MONO. I knew this producer well and know that his stereo mix is by far the intended mix. By this time mono was a quick combining for AM radio. Columbia must have damaged the stereo masters to bring this album to us in mono instead of stereo. It is definetly not as enjoyable a listen in this format.
5,A Pearl Beyond Price,"The Byrds fifth album is by far thier most experimental, using phasing and other processing techniques. It stands well beside such works as the Beatles White Album in spirit, and manages even to rise above it for the excess is reined in and the experimentation never overpowers the harmony and blessed melodicism. Groundbreaking, but grounded. A delight."
5,two things of note...,"All the other posts sum up my feelings about this masterpiece - I just want to put in my two cents:1) Props to Red Rhoads, pedal steel guitarist extraordinairre (and Mike Nesmith's loyal sidekick) for his majestic work throughout this LP - NOBODY plays pedal like this virtuoso!!!2) Kudos, too, to McGuinn for artfully absconding with a familiar folk melody for use in ""Space Oddysey"": Talent creates, but genius steals!"
4,Mixed flock of Byrds,"The Byrds/ Wanted-The Notorious Byrd Brothers: I like this album but it is a mix of different styles and it does not feel like an album, more like an odds and sods kind of release. However, with ""Goin' Back"", ""Wasn't born to follow"" and ""Old John Robertson"" among the songs, It is an album well worth having. There is a new version of this CD with a few bonus tracks. I don't like the bonus tracks (with the exception of ""triad"" which can be found elsewhere). With the bonus tracks CD costing twice that of the original CD (in 2011), I would definitely get the original 11 track CD and save the money."
5,Serene,"This Byrds creation came as a surprise to me back when it was released. I thought the Byrds were done with after hearing of Crosby being out and of course Clark had become a complete non-player. I bought this on a whim and the cover was inviting. I remember listening to it in my room at my parents house and I felt comfort from the mood of the album. The sweet Byrds, the serenity of the mood. I have this one on CD and still get it out on occasion and feel mysef ""goin back"" to a time and place that I wish would never have ended. I recommend this to everyone."
4,Overlooked psychedelic classic,"For some reason, many people never include this album with the true psychedelic greats. They'll often insert 5th Dimension. Notorious Byrd Brothers is WAY more psychedelic. The guys discovered phasing, moog synthesizers and mellotrons for this album. The only dark spot, as mentioned by other listeners, is the stodgy Space Odyssey, which tries to be an American ""Interstellar Overdrive,"" only without much energy or melody. But this album belongs in any 'delic music lover's collection. Songs like ""Wasn't Born to Follow"" ""Natural Harmony"" and ""John Robertson"" are as 'delic as they come."
2,Judging a rescord by its cover,"Notorious Byrd Brothers is a great record, though as Mr Goodwin notes, the recording is kind of muddy. I bought this SACD recording on Mr Goodwin's recommendation. He will not want to meet me for a few weeks. The Mobile Fidelity SACD issue is frankly no better in any way than the Columbia Legacy stereo mix. And if you can hear any difference between the mono and Stereo mixes, then you are concentrating 100% on every note being played, and probably being victimized by your imagination. The cover says the record is SACD. So you should expect a better quality of sound on SACD equipment. NOPE. That is not what you get. On my SACD Pioneer player, the ""SACD"" sound is no better than the Columbia Legacy issue. A mono mix that is really the same as the stereo. And a sound that SACD did not improve. And an attractive cover. That is what you get when you buy this."
5,A Florida Undeground Jewel,"Anything on this album was probably executed better and bolder by any post hardcore group you can think of with a taste for intense melodic slam dance numbers. But to me, What Wishes Can't Mend find exciting and capturing ways to embrace the over breeding of underground hardcore. Probably broken up, this band will still have The Insomniac Diaries to show for it. A hyperactive little album featuring intensely fevered guitars and standard intense drumming and roaring with the occasional spoken lyrics. While bands like Poison The Well have already trademarked this brand of music. I still like to see what some bands can do with it. And this band with better lyrics and catchier riffs, caught my ear. I'd reccomend it for anyone else who wants a refreshing taste of spazzy melodic hardcore. Give it a chance, you obviously haven't heard of them."
5,2-year-old loves it,"Our 2-year-old son loves this book! He loves the colors & shapes DVD too. He always specifically asks for ""Boz."" :)"
1,waste of money,"This book was absolutely dreadful. I bought it based on the glowing reviews here but now I'm convinced they were written by the author and/or the author's friends. Otherwise, some people have extremely low standards for literature, a term I use very loosely when reviewing this book. As far as the person who said the book is ""laugh out loud funny"", are you smoking crack? Either you read a totally different book or you're referring to the unintentional humor caused by the book's many misspellings, tortured syntax and general awfulness.There's a reason certain books are self-published."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book on the basis of the other reviews. I don't know. Are we reading the same book? The characters are not very well-developed, and the editing of the book was quite shoddy. The story idea was good, but the execution of it was extremely poor."
1,Horribly disappointing,"I would not recommend this book to anyone other as a ""what not to do"" when writing a novel. The grammar, writing style, editing, and lack of character development totally detract from the mediocre plot. I honestly feel the author had a good idea for a storyline and for her characters. However, the book falls short of hitting the mark."
5,Enchanting,"A marvel of a book. A strange, terrific, spell-casting story. This book delivers rich in imaginative bravado and psychological nuance. One approaches the final pages with a heavy heart for several reasons, not the least of which being that this fine read has come to an end. What gives this novel its power is the author's flair for sketching the subtleties of her character's behavior. one of the most romantic, strange, terrific, spell-casting stories I've read in years. This tragicomic novel- a fantasia of love and deceit, invokes the glorious, unreliable promises of love."
2,This book has a great message,"This book actually has a great message... that women should stop doting on losers who don't pay attention to them and move on. However, I would up the anty even farther than this book did and argue that even IF a man is afraid of commitment, etc., if he's a waste of your time, he's a waste of your time, period. Stop looking for the diamond in the rough. I'm a fan of her column, and think that she should write non-fiction, she's way better at that."
5,On Target,"This was an honest book containing difficult truths for some women to hear, but it was written with so much kindness and wit that I found it enjoyable as well as informative. We have all made the mistake of wanting the guy to like us so bad that we will make all kinds of excuses for his obvious disinterest in us. It is refreshing to look at this behavior in its real light because it gives you a better chance not to fall for it again.Bravo to this writer for doing such a nice job. I found it at times a funny, entertaining, and truthful look at dating. Girls, we've just got to erase the memory of reading about the frog and the prince. These fairy tales teach us to be idealistic but not realistic. So here's one good book that will surely debunk the myths."
1,Most poorly written and edited book I've ever seen,"I'm still in shock over this badly written book, and even more by the large number of glowing reviews. It hardly seems like we're talking about the same book. It's just not even publishable quality. The grammar and punctuation alone make it almost unreadable. The story - while a good concept - begs to be written by someone with a better command of the English language and at least a glimmer of writing skill."
5,"A technical, task oriented and all encompassing book","I have developed components with Delphi before, and work with Java now. This book brought out the elements of Beans and their usage so effectively, I could get down to create some Beans quickly.He has covered most elements of Bean development from a programmer's perspective, which is what Beans developers need. If you are going to make beans, go ahead and pick this one as your first book."
1,cheap,This product is cheaply made and isn't up to the quality I expected for the money I paid for it. I took the chance because there were no reviews on it.If you are trying to fix a wrist breakdown in your golf swing I would get one of those golf gloves that does not allow your wrist to bend. I have one and I like it much better.
5,Saves me time,"Job searching on the Internet had become so popular that it's impossible to keep up with all of the resources available today. Since some sites are better and/or more relevant to a job seeker than others, it pays to have a resource like this ""web bible"". And no one I've seen is more current and knowledgeable about what's on the 'Net than Crispin and Mehler."
4,Between Two Worlds,Highly informative and well thought out and organized. This book is also easy-reading. The various subjects and Richardson's broad experience gave an insightful analysis to measure him as a Governor and possibly President of the U.S.
2,bassically,"Suitable for making your car windows rattle. Will flash you back to the mid 90's with funky bass breaks. A few heart pounders that are fun if you are flying.Not as heavy as DJ Irene or Bad Boy Bill, not even close to the mastery of Aprhodite. DJ Icey has done better with essential mixes although I'd skip his Disco Rodeo the release party was a BOMB!"
2,"Soft On Outside, Rough On Inside","The outside of this robe is very soft, but the inside is rough and scratchy. I don't understand! You can turn it inside out, but then you can't use the belt loops. It does have belt loops at two different heights, which is nice to make it fit right. It's a good length--I'm 5'6, and it hits at mid calf. But the point of a robe is for it to be soft and comfortable, which it isn't. The seams on the belt are also unraveling after about 10 washes."
2,Vegan Being Pretty Good,This book is fairly average. It has good information on nutrition and foods. But a lot of it is obvious or can be found for free on the web at places like:[...]However if you want some basic information I'd look into it.
4,Basic facts about veganism,"Remember this book is basically question and answer and lacks the flow I like in many other vegan books. It's a lot of useful information. Being a vegan myself I thought I knew everything but there were many eye openers in this one. The thing I didnt like is that she does not promote veganism in cats nor dogs. It has been well known for long that dogs can be very healthy and happy and nutritionally satisfied on a meat free diet. And since now there is a synthetic form of taurine cats aren't dependent on their meat diets anymore either. Read ""Obligate Carnivore"" by Jed Gillen to inform yourself about having vegan pets. Please don't take her advice - there is a lot of suffering we can spare by feeding our pets a vegan diet, without sacrificing their health."
2,Biased and Unrealistic,"This is a good book if you are twelve years old, or know nothing about vegan or vegetarianism. I stopped reading on page 42 at the line ""Carnivores are physically designed to hunt, kill and devour their quarry quickly and painlessly."" Right. Being ripped apart by teeth and claws doesn't hurt at all. This book is repetitive of basic ideas and contains such biased and unrealistic fantasys. Don't get me wrong - I am trying to transform myself into a vegan. I believe it is the right way to live. There are just better books out there about veganism."
2,Hmmmmmmmm. . .,"Unless you own a laptop or a REALLY old desktop this Ram is NOT compatable. I ordered 4 sticks of it ony to find out that it is 533 Mhz I dont understand why i have to click ""more technical details"" to see how many Mhz it is. This may be good for laptops but it is an absolute failure for new desktops. Btw heres my computer build. MSI Platium Mother Board, ZOTAC Ge Force 8800, Intel Quad Core 2.4 MhZ, Baracuda 250 GB hard drive"
4,Very godd value,"Good value. Good brand, works well. Memory helps a lot, I'm planning on instaling windows 7 now, should do great."
2,Would not work in iBook G4,"The memory module would not physically plug into my iBook G4 (1 gHz 2004 14"" model). Something on the bottom side would not allow the left side (short side) fit into the slot ... it tried for a while but no luck. Too bad because it was a great price."
3,Blood type test kit from Eldoncard,For the most part this is a good product but I ordered 7 of them and so far 2 have had a faulty dropper which caused the product to get ruined. So I have wasted 20.00 dollars.This is out of the 4 I have used. This is not particularly good odds.
1,Instructions & video no help,"I got 2 kits to type both my children. My husband & I both read the directions carefully. We watched the video on website, but it cut off at the point where they started collecting blood on the sticks, so the information we most wanted was not on there. We each did a child & both of us had problems collecting enough blood for the stick. The lancet only works once, so if you don't get enough on the first try, you've wasted your money. Also, the circles where you put the water drop & blood look nothing like the results pictured on the instructions, so I have no idea what the 2 circles we did get reveal to us."
1,Didn't work for me.,Did not work and was a total waste of time and money. Followed directions and no definitive answer. I would not recommend this to anyone else.
1,not worth it,I brought 2 and neither 1 of them worked. The results were not clear. I still do not know my blood type. Waste of money
1,Waste of Money,I tried to do this test. Did not work at all. Everything smeared and I had no choice but to throw it out.
2,too see video overrated,"to watch the video on how to do the test is way overrated. could not down load because the website changed. once i downloaded the second choice i could not get the video to play. to watch the video is way over rated because there was no video to watch. i asked my daughter to help who works with computers and she could not get it to work. I am fustrated with this product and would have felt more comfortable watching the video before doing the one time shot. i purchased this product because of the reviews that said easy. Fustrating and confussing are more like it. A support phone number would have been nice. i wasted 2 hours of my life trying to figure out how to watch the video, what a waste."
4,Ron's Review,"Follow the directions and it works great. The single use, spring loaded lancet was painless to all. The chart was easy to read but don't be stingy with the blood."
1,Would not buy again,Video was not helpfull ended before it gave complete directions. Test went wrong. Should not have to buy two tests to get results.
3,"Great kit, lancet not so great","So the kit was great, I followed the instructions and am satisfied with my results. The only problem was the lancet did not work, which is sort of key to the whole operation. I might have just not fully understood how to use it. I have used other lancets all the time this one was just different. I had another so I just used it and everything else went smoothly. If the lancet doesn't work then, ask a diabetic friend to have one of theirs or, the can be easily found at drug stores."
4,Accurate,Pretty accurate and helpful if you need to know your type. I only advise that you order more than one just in case you mess one up....Read directions carefully.
1,Lancet did not work sufficiently,"The instructions were fairly easy to follow, but the lancet was far from useful. There was not enough for even one of the 4 mixing sticks. I had already started the test (water over the reagents) per the instructions. I was relegated to using a safety razor to nick the fingertip and draw enough blood to complete the test."
3,You need to know what you're doing,"I couldn't find a record of my blood type so my husband recommended I buy this kit. I still don't really know what my blood type is. The instructions are lengthy and slightly difficult even for my husband who has a BS in engineering. That being said, it's a good experiment for older kids who are doing a project. It's possible that my blood was too thin that day and the watery consistency made it difficult to read the results.So, in short, you should get this if you're relatively smart and can't find any other record of your blood type. Otherwise just call your doctor and ask."
4,"works well, but multiple stabs needed","This kit arrived quickly and safely. It worked well if you follow directions and results are easy to read. But, as stated in other product reviews, your initial stab wound will probably clot before you have extracted the four drops of blood needed for this test. I needed three finger pricks to extract four drops of blood. The kit only includes one, single-use lancet, so you will likely need to line up another sterile stabbing device. I had a needle handy and used it. Other than that, kit works as advertised."
4,Looks trickier than it is,"Received the kit quicker than expected. Arrived in perfect condition, with the expiration date well into next year. Read all of the directions first, take your time, and it shouldn't be too difficult to find out your blood type. It will help a lot if you lay all supplies out beforehand, and have no interruptions during the testing."
4,it is as described,"I received this today and was excited to try this. Had to track down my package since the wind blew it away from my door step.It is exactly as described. Mine didn't give definite answers except for the A. Probably because that had the most blood.I wish there was two lancets. I was a huge baby! And wasted the one given because I just knew it would hurt. Because of me being silly, I had to take it apart and stab my fingers and I did it more than once to get enough blood. This hurt more than the lancet I bet. Will have to order this again for I can get definite results since I messed my first one up. Overall great product. Tells you exactly how to do it."
4,Works well!,"Works as described, I didn't have a problem with the lancet that other people seemed to have. If you're worried about this just buy a small pack of lancets from the store beforehand, and make sure you're going from the side of the finger, not on the front."
1,Waste of Money,"We bought this test kit to determine my husband's blood type since I am Rh negative and pregnant. The lancet was useless, it didn't produce enough blood for one circle--and we only needed two circles (antigen D and control). Save your money or get a lancet with deeper gauge--that might work better."
3,My Dog Likes Them But...,"My dog likes them, but I do not. I mentioned in a couple other reviews that I have an older dog who is missing quite a few teeth. I look for soft treats that can be broken into smaller bites. I also prefer ones that are not wet or gooey. Our go-to favorites areCanine Carry OutsandMilk-Bone Healthy Favorites Chewy Treats.These Beggin Littles are small of soft. My dog likes them. Unfortunately I don't like the smell. They are quite strong and stinky.I will buy these again for my dog since he likes them. I just wish they weren't so pungent. Dogs have great noses. They don't need to be blasted with such a strong scent."
1,Song beats are faster than original,I love James Brown I have been a fan of his for years. I bought two CD's this week that both stink. Some of the songs skip too. The songs seem to be faster than when he orginally sang them years ago. The sound quality is bad and so is the singing. Please Please Don't Go is way to fast. The quality of this so called live concert is bad. He is drowned out by the band. Forget this one and one called Volume 2 R&B made in Holland. These CD's are cheap and not worth it.
3,GREAT IDEA BUT FLAWED,"Stunning full page photographs are coupled with original source material by Native Americans on their child hood. Included are both contemporary and earlier sources. A wonderful idea,but not fully carried out. There needs to be some explanation of various customs. For example, one boy talks of blackening his teeth with charcoal, but we are never told why. I am very glad to have the book, but it could have been so much more."
2,Review of Camps and Cottages,"Camps and Cottages has some nice photographs of interior home furnishings. What I didn't like about the book are several things. The pictures are repeated throughout the book. For the price of this book I want to see original pictures on each page. The use of small pictures, about 1"" square is really difficult for the eye to see. Printing text over textured, colored pages is extremely difficult to read. Descriptions are given of various rooms with no pictures to match, causing the reader confusion. Some photographs are cut off, even though the description includes items not seen. Some of the photographs are out of focus."
3,COTTAGE LIVING,"I was looking for a book with a softer approach and lighter colors. This book would be great for someone who loves dark colors, such as greens, browns, reds and plaids, and wants a more primative old fashioned approach. Also some of the pictures were quite small."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought this book would be one that I could refer to for ideas. There are ideas, but they seem to be the same ones over and over throughout. There was no information on how to achieve the interiors, plus they appeared to be places owned by wealthy people who could afford decorators. The photos were crammed full of objects, with little open space so that the special things stood out. It's easy to cram a small space full of things, but I am looking for small spaces that are beautiful, comfortable, functional, and as spacious as possible. Not so here. Also, the photos felt contrived. I noticed in several that the same objects kept showing up so it seemed as if they were moved around the cabin to give ""atmosphere"" to the photos. The book was in beautiful shape when I got it from the shipper."
3,Not Enough...,"After completing several projects using various versions of iMovie, I've recently made the switch to Final Cut Express to increase my editing capabilities.I'm disappointed in this book, which was offered for $40 at the Apple store when buying the Final Cut Express software.The text lacks in-depth information about FCE's video and audio filters, and fails to adequately cover the software basics. The authors' suggest their own website for more information, but there's nothing on it.I'm going to try Tom Wolsky's book and hope for a better guide."
2,Would have been a great magazine article,"The premise of this book is fun - find out what makes the soccer heart of a hopeless (in soccer term's) nation tick. But the problem is that at 300 pages, and with little in the way of interesting soccer - or national - history to examine, the author is forced to conduct in depth interviews with the principals of the Liechenstein soccer world.And they repeat each other ad nauseum - ""we played hard... we must establish ourselves a s afootballing nation...things are getting better"" you get the point after the first interview. By the 6th or 7th it's eye glazing.Someone should tell the editors out there that it's better to have an interesting 200 page book than a dull 300 page book"
3,It is what it is,"Users must keep in mind what this is - a cultivator/harrow not a plow. This is not intended to break virgin/hardpacked soil, a disk is inteded to break up dirt clods, or cultivate previously worked soil. If you need to break ground get a tiller or a PLOW. Used after the brinly moldboard plow it breaks up and smoothes the soil out. Also good for scarring the ground before overseeding lawn with seed, then go over with roller to pack it down. This item does what it says it will - download the manual for more info."
1,floated over the ground even with weights,I thought it might help break up the soil around my home. It barely made a scratch on the dirt even with 3 cinderblocks on top. I even sharpened the edges thinking it just needed a little help. No such luck. It must be for situations where the dirt is nice and soft and loamy to begin with.
1,Won't cut sod.,"I am guessing that the disc may work on soil that is already tilled and nearly ready to plant. I hoped it would cut through sod, but in spite of how much weight I added no luck."
1,Like a foul-tasting Breakfast Club,"This book is a quick-read, which is good, because it's poorly written. There are many sterotypes and it should offend many groups. Many of the entries are in poor taste and at least two of the characters' entries are filled with profanity. I don't understand why this book would be recommended by anyone; especially in light of the recent college tragedy."
3,"When you are expecting gold, silver is a dissappointment.","The reviewer above captured my sentiments exactly. There are some fine moments in this disc, but some others that are out of place and of little musical appeal. The album confirms his talent; he needs to refocus to maximize same."
3,"good, but not good enough.","BIG MAMA'S DOOR was a landmark, so it's not exactly a surpirse that TERRITORY doesn't live up to the expectations and excitement that the last album stirred. no way is the album bad, but it's disappointing. many of the songs are strong, but some of the tunes that hart worked up with his friends are just tollerable. just because they had fun playing them doesn't mean they'll work on an album, which makes the style of the whole work bafflingly inconsistent. it sounds like he got too much freedom from his record company. in this case, a little imposed focus wouldn't be a bad thing. oh well, it just sets hart up for a killer comeback on his third album!"
3,Dawn's Early Light,"Not the best. Full of unrealistic action, but all and all, it works well as a way not to watch TV."
4,good read,"This book was a good value for the money. All the things I like to read about, submarine warfare, special ops, high tech. It also ended in a way that leads in to another book..."
5,The best Cd Mark has produced to date,This CD has the clean fresh feel of Mark Ford with the strength of Robben Ford and the Blue Line to back him up. The tracks have a lot of energy and variety. You'll find yourself reaching for this one again and again.
4,"Good, hard sci-fi!","This is one of the better science fiction books I've read in a long time. It weaves alien symbiosis, Solar System-wide war, personality transference, and psychiatric sleuthing into a great whodunit. It's marred only by the unreasonable choice of setting it in the period A.D. 2040 to 2070. It took me half of the novel to put that in the back of my mind. A.D. 2340 would have been more appropriate. Other than that, it was an outstanding read. I don't think they come any better than Sheffield."
3,"Good book, gives ideas, but doesn't tell you how.","I bought a 7 year old Morgan who had the brain of a 3 year old. She was broke, but didn't know how to stop, back up, or anything else. I was basically starting from scratch, but not really. This book has one whole entire chapter on breaking, which is good for some, but not for me. I needed the basics, but not those ones. What I am trying to say is that when it came to important things for me, they told you what to do, but not how to do it. So I've ended up training my horse through my own techniques, which, I think that a 15 year old girl's techniques are probably not the best. However, this book did give me good ideas on what to work on, in what order, so it helped me in that way, plus it was interesting to read. The people this book would benefit the most is people with colts that their lifetime career is reining, not just a hobby."
5,"Works Great, Cheap Fix",Great product for a great price. Took care of flea problem very easily and alot cheaper then having professionals come out or bombing house. Plus dont have to leave house for hours after spraying. Strongly recommend.
5,Works quick,"Really wipes out the fleas but be aware of the inital smell, Very strong, make sure you remove all pets people and open windows for a few hours before re-entering, great for spot control also! If you have an infestation consider this product. I always keep K9 Advanticks on my dog and they still got fleas somehow but this wiped them out and they havent come back even with no flea treatments."
4,"New York, New York","Was anyone else here besides me at that New York club show, lo those many years ago, when PIL came out behind a screen and started playing ""The Flowers of Romance"" and a riot with flying bottles, ash trays and what have you broke out. The mob tore the screen down and roadies raced out to protect Johnny and company and got them out with their lives and glass shattered everywhere in the mayhem until the coppers arrived. I was under my table as a protective measure, but, lord almighty, I done saw it all that night. John Lydon just loved to mess with the image of rock star and rile up the populace. Great theater, even if it was real. We never did get to hear the end of the first song. Another one in the memorable loss column."
3,i sent you flowers...but you wanted chocolates instead!,strange but i like strange. features middle eastern influences which is nice. this is extremely unique album. worth getting simply because PiL is the only band that attempted such music. the percussion is tribal simple and militant all at once. i am afraid to listen to this album in the dark.
5,ARISE IN THE WEST.THE NEW CRUSADE,BE AFRAID.WHEN MUSIC FOLLOWS FORMS EASILY IMITATED AS ALL RULES ARE IT DENIES PROGRESS.STAGNANT SHADOWING CAN SO EASILY REPLACE THE TEMPORY VALUE OF GUIDELINES.LEARN FROM EVERYTHING AND YOU NEED FOLLOW NOTHING.ANY CAN COPY BUT ALL TOO FEW CREATE.WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORDS ITS ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE BE AFRAID.THE IMITATORS OUT THERE WILL BLAND YOU INTO CONFORMITY.ENTERTAINMENT CAN BE FREE OF ENTRAPMENT AS THIS CD CONTESTS .A STUNNING WAKEUP CALL.
5,Essential PIL,"call me an old-timer, but the first 3 albums of PIL were and will remain the only PIL. throw in the live in Paris album and the ""Home is Where the Heart Is"" single and you have all you will ever need. First Issue, Second Edition & Flowers of Romance are three wildly different works of art that together I would stand up against any three albums from any other band. I saw them in San Francisco at the Elite Club after the Flowers of Romance release. Wobble was no longer with the band at this point, but it was still the best show I have ever seen and I even ended up with John Lydon's t-shirt. Good Times! So it's been 25 some years since then and I am dropping tunes off Flowers of Romance to unsuspecting young kids in Ukraine and their eyes are popping out. This album, unlike me, never gets old!"
5,Brilliant and brave......,"Ever heard the adage, ""a band can only be as good as it's drummer""?. Well this one is a genius. Let him steer the ship, and put John Lydon's voice and couragous vision on top, and you've got a unique, nighmarishly brilliant disc."
5,pivotal in my growth as an adolescent,"This album cemented the PiL sound. Tight orchestration provides an aural landscape that foreshadows anything ""listenable"" NiN or Marylin Manson could dream up."
3,"Somewhat Clever, but Unlistenable","It sounds like what it is - two guys capable of interesting ideas locked in the studio in absence of a band, trying to create product.For the last time, Lydon attempts to use his voice in the service of abstract art. He does a good job but so what? The music has practically nothing to say. ""I like to bother people"" is the overwhelming statement here.I think ""Go Back"" worked well, ""Banging the Door"" was a memorable tone poem, and there are a few interesting moments on Side 1. But if I lost my copy of this, I certainly wouldn't bother buying it again.The cover was unusually striking, coming out at a time when in fact most American kids hadn't even heard the Sex Pistols yet - you wanted to hear what was in here. But there's really not much in here."
4,Reminds me of The Cure's 'Pornography',"'Flowers of Romance' reminds me a lot of 'Pornography' by The Cure. I guess it's the emphasis on the heavy, almost-tribal percussion. Both albums used the same drum sound and both have quite a grim lyrical outlook. I think this is PiL's best work as I like the almost-Middle Eastern sounds with the heavy percussion along with John Lydon's monotone, Cockney whine. If I was forced to choose a favorite off the album, I would definitely choose the title track(although 'Go Back' would be a very close second). The title track has the tribal drumming that, along with that kind of Middle Eastern sound, make it one of the strangest, yet most engaging tunes I have ever heard. This album has kind of a gothic feel to it. Not surprising with the style of percussion and lyrical content. I can't listen to it enough. One of the all-time great pop(if it could even be called that)records, yet sadly underrated."
2,"Crappy movie, but worth every penny for Kristine DeBell fans.","Poorly written, directed, and edited, with ridiculous mood shifts from zany, to ominous, then back to zany again. On the plus side, the bus scene at the beginning is kind of fun, and a couple of lines and moments here and there are so ridiculous they're funny. Lots of cute topless girls, but the real reason to watch? Kristine of course. She's not topless in this, but she doesn't need to be. She's one of the sweetest girls in the history of the movies, but never got the right role to be really big. The good news? We find out in the interview/commentary that she is back in Hollywood after having a family, and she is going to attempt to restart her career. This is her first ever interview, and though her memory is fuzzy after all these years, she still reveals a lot of things about her life. Anyone who's ever fallen for her charms will thoroughly enjoy this. She's 55 now and still cute. 2 stars for the movie, 5 for Kristine!"
5,Thus far the best published sheet music collection,"I have several books of Tori Amos music, but I bought this for some of the harder to find pieces. Overall, this is my favorite book and the one I play out of the most. I have played piano for a few years but am not very skilled - however I can work my way through most of the music. Some of the songs require more work (Caught a Lite Sneeze, Space Dog) and some like Mother, Putting the Damage On and Winter are pretty easy. I play several instruments and have been able to adapt the music easily to guitar and flute. The only thing I haven't really liked is that since Tori Amos supposedly never writes down music, this doesn't translate to printed versions of audio recording. However, I have seen her live many times and every time each song changes, so a written version of any song is given to improvisation."
5,A Powerful Read,"While this book was originally written years ago, the problem of homelessness is still huge today. Kozol puts a real face on homelessness through his interviews with victims of this societal problem. Many people are only one or two paychecks away from ending up in this plight. Compounding this reality with other problems such as mental illness, lack of family support, or low educational level makes it impossible to blame the victim. As a society we need to do much more to help the children who are enduring this to have a better life so they will be able to escape this tragedy in the future."
5,Very insightful!,"This book delivers a powerful message that anyone can become homeless. It provides a moving account of the life-and-death struggles faced by homeless men, women, and children in America today. Kozol does a good job in showing how government policies worsen the problems of the homeless. I recommend this book to anyone interested in social change and to anyone who thinks homelessness is a choice."
5,A scary and moving view of how far too many people live,"I read the book for a sociology class I am taking. I remember talking to friend who was reading a book on poverty in Northern India and then I said to her, ""Look what's going on in our cities."" Her reaction was the same as mine, a sense of toal disbelief that we let this happen.The most telling aspect of the book is how easily we can get there. We often overlook the forgotten members of our society, this book serves as a startling reminder that not all Americans live in the suburbs with two cars in the garage.Without laying the statistics on too thick, Kozol shows us how we have neglected our children. An amazing book for those who want to make a change and for those who don't feel a change it needed."
4,Good Book,"The book was in pretty good shape, as listed, but the shipping took much longer than expected."
2,Very one sided,"This guy has some good interviews and statistics, but his conclusion is to blame everyone. Nobody who is homeless is at fault in his book. Blame anyone isnt homeless should be his motto."
5,thank you pooh,"This book is an awesome book to teach recycling and to celebrate Earth Day. I teach Kindergarten and the students loved this book and we were able to discuss it for more than thirty minutes without any problems. I have a three foot Winnie the Pooh, and ten flower pots that I use as honey pots,we read the story interactively and the students love every moment and I am able to get across some very worthwhile points about recycling and caring for the environment."
4,"Great dvd set, I am really glad i bought it, i thought it would not be available in the US, but it was , thanks","A little beat up, but good dvd set. anyone would enjoy this if they are a fan of Law and Order series"
3,You've seen all these stories before,"I just want to emphasize something the first reviewer mentioned: all these stories are remakes of the American series. They are not just ""based on"" the American episodes, they are almost scene-for-scene, line-for-line the same (with the appropriate English slang and legal jargon substituted, of course). So if you're a big fan of the American series, you already know the plot, the characters, the twists and turns and the outcome.At least for me, a different setting does not make it worth while to purchase the same stories on disc a second time."
5,A must for early episode Law and Order fans.,"I've been a Law and Order fan, particularly of the first ten seasons for a longtime. And a fan of British drama and comedy, too. This DVD set was such a treat for me, I truly enjoyed it! Too bad that this wasn't released ten years earlier so that Lenny and Reynaldo could visit them as they did on Homicide: Life on the Street. I can't wait for L&O UK 2."
1,British??,"This was strictly American television. It had no sense ofbeing British. I was very disappointed, and stopped watchingafter one disc."
3,Okay...,"I think this book is okay. It does not live up to it's predessuccor and not enough feeling. The first book had the right amount between humor and fighting. This book does not have enough humor. I was trying to go on and finally finished it in about 2 weeks. Besides, if anyone read the Shaman, the first book, they are going to think it skeptical that killing a Ulharl (what Bolenkar the main bad guy is) is so hard. In the first book, Darian kills the Ulharl with two hits. So it's an okay book but I think it has to much love too. And it is hard to believe that Oharl's (Illbane)body is not decayed after 5 centuries. So my verdict is:1 star for a little fighting1 star for what's left of humor1 star for characters-2 stars for just plain awkward storythis book gets 3 stars"
5,Corvette C4 power chips,HiThis is a good product and very fast shippedMy corvette now run well on the french roadsphil from France
5,awesome!,"I first heard Danny Wright play live when I was a teenager and his music was so captivating. I love that I have this on my Kindle and I can listen to it when I read or want to ""veg out "" from the kid noise :)"
2,Easy To Dislike,"There was not one character that I cared to follow. If they all got killed it would be a blessing; the sooner the better. I looked for someone on the subway to give this book to as I was half way through it, however, all the people looked too nice to inflict with this rubbish."
2,Sandford Disappoints,"I've read all of the books in the Prey series and this, without a doubt, is Sandford's worst effort/installment. There are simply too many characters that Sandford does not develop. With a number of people suspected of doing the dirty deeds, Sandford comes out of left field and introduces important characters much too late in the book. Sandford does not give any real insight into the killer and Davenport gets on to the trail of the real killer wholly by accident. At the end, I was left saying - ""That's it, you've got to be kidding me."" The end was rushed and thrown together in a haphazard manner - did Sandford have to meet a deadline? That being said, Davenport is still one of the best characters in this genre and we can only hope that the next installment in the Prey series will be much better than this effort by Sandford. Everyone deserves a mulligan; however, as I recall from childhood, there's only one allowed per round."
2,Easy Prey,"I was disappointed in this latest Sandford offering, and I buy his books, the day that they are released. This mystery thriller drug, and in the end, I felt that he had to end it, and hadn't a clue whom to name as the killer, since most of the major players had already become victims. I definitely would not recommend this one."
2,"""Prey"" for this one","I have read every Prey book. Unfortunately Easy Prey is a disappointment. I am committed to finish every book I start but this was hard. Lucas Davenport was out of his element. He was having sex with a bisexual woman who also had a previous relationship with her brother, lusting after an old flame from college and still bumping into Weather. Lucas is a womanizer but this was pretty far fetched. The plot was hard to follow. There should gave been much more looking into the killer's mind. That is the great part of previous Prey books. I read another review that said this one was written on autopilot (like the house payment was due and he needed some coin). I am sure his new Prey book will return him to excellence."
3,not as good as the previous book in the series,"A high profile model is murdered. Lucas Davenport is led into the world of drugs and sex and parties. Del Shannon, a colleague of Davenport's, was there at the party where the murder occurred as an undercover cop and now he is a suspect.Lucas's love life is in turmoil as he has not one but four women interested in him, an ex-girlfriend, ex-fiancee, victim and new woman.In past Prey books the reader knew who the killer was and then the killer's character was developed throughout the book. Here the reader is not given the killer's name and can't even guess at the identity as no glimpses of the killer are around until near the end of the book.I felt that this book was confusing and goes in a completely different way then previous books in the series and as such was not as good as the others in the series."
4,Solid As Ususal,"Sanford delivers his usual well written thriller. The hooks were topical, the characters solid, the pace good. The ""mystery woman"" twist was unusual (as if REAL Sanford readers need a reason to wait for the next installment) The only downer was the actual killer; a bit of a stretch. Well worth the time and money spent; but I still think Lucas is waiting for Miss right...Next time?"
5,Another John Sandford goodie.,"Easy Prey follows in the footsteps of the other Sandford ""Prey"" books. I have all of his ""Prey"" books and several of Sanford's other novels, all of them great reading. He continues to keep the reader interested and anxious to read the next page. One of the top authors of crime/mystery books. I look forward to his next writing."
3,Great Series - This one wasn't 'Easy' to read,"I have recently been introduced to John Sanford's 'Prey' series and have now read all of the books available except the newest one. Unfortunately, Easy Prey was the slowest reading of the bunch for me. It didn't pick up until the end. Just a tad dissapointed of this one."
1,what a disappointment,"First of all, I would like to say that I am a long time fan of the ""Prey"" novels. I can never wait for the next novel from this talented author. However, this last book was extremely different from his previous ""Prey"" books. It focused primarily on Lucas' love life, instead of the murder/mystery. I enjoy his plots, based on detective work, along with a love twist, but this was ridiculous. If I wanted a book about a mans love life, I would have bought a cheap romance book. The case wasn't even solved by skill, but luck. And while the case should have received more attention, we only could read of his sex life. Sorry, but I hope the next one's better, it would be ashame if they continued like this one. I usually enjoy them so much. I hope I will be able to continue to do so. In short, less sex life, more mystery. Weather's return would be appreciated."
1,"Boring, boring , boring","I struggled to finish this book. Kept on turning the pages hoping that it would improve, it didn't. Characters were dull, plot confusing. A waste of time and money."
2,Disappointing,I have not finished the book yet but I decided to check out the reviews to see if I was missing something. I have been looking forward to reading this book as I am a huge fan of the other Davenport books. But I am having a hard time sticking with this. The plot is confusing and I don't care about any of the characters this time. Did the same author really write this? The only good thing is I am reading a library copy and am not out any cash!
2,A Waste of Time and Money,"I've read all of the Prey books, and have generally been a fan. Easy Prey is by far the worse, just a plot outline masquerading as a novel. Even though I've read the previous books, I had trouble keeping Lucas' assistants straight, with the possible exception of Del. This book is much more of a police procedural than the previous ones, and it isn't a very good one. Here's hoping that Sandford returns to the winner's column with his next Prey."
3,Lacks sizzle; not a lot of steak either,"I've been a John Sandford (and Lucas Davenport) fan for years, and I'm sorry to say that Easy Prey is just not as good as its predecessors. That's not to say it's bad. The great regular cast of characters is there, but they're not even close to being the astute and cohesive investigative team they have been in the past. The bizarre character names Mr. Sandford has invented are maddening. I even spotted five typographical errors. Let's just call it an ""okay read"" and wait, hopefully, for the next Prey."
1,A Struggle to Read,Sandford has always been my favorite--until now. This book was really a disappointment. I didn't even like Lucas in this one. Did a computer write it?
2,A Big Disappointment,"I am a huge fan of Sanford's ""Prey"" series, but this one was a disappointment. Too many suspects (none too interesting) to keep track of or care about. This was definitely not the usual page-turner. Lucas seems to be losing his edge. I usually rush out for the next book when it's released. I haven't given up, but I'm going to wait next time."
2,Easy Prey - too easy for the writer,"I have to agree with others that this is, by far, John Sanford's worst. I look so forward to each of his books and love Lucas Davenport. But this book was a huge disappointment. His earlier novels seemed so real that you found yourself checking to make sure your doors were locked so some killer didn't come after you. With Easy Prey, I couldn't relate. I think we've all had enough of the drugged-out models and that whole scene. I expected a lot more from an obviously talented writer. As a lot of writers get more popular, they seem to churn out more garbage because people buy based on their previous experiences. Sad to say, but John Sanford just churned this one out."
2,What Happened!,"Bring back the old Lucas Davenport. This is the worst of the series. I've read them all and I've liked them all. What happened Mr Sanford? Are your tiring of Lucas and company. It took me two weeks to read this book, where is usually takes me a day or two. There was no punch, no excitement. For a while there I started to get confused when they finally got around to figuring out who the killer was. And Lucas has never made this many mistakes. The ending was as lackluster as heck. Mr Sandford, I can't believe you did this to your loyal fans. And believe me, I am a loyal fan to your character Lucas Davenport. This still doesn't mean I'll given up. I can only hope the next Davenport novel is better."
3,Easy Prey Disappoints,"""Easy Prey"" disappointed me. The whole book seemed shallow and convoluted, and the solution, at the end, seemed to come out of left field. It didn't seem investigated or developed enough. In addition, I found myself mentally ""shouting"" at Lucas throughout, trying to nudge him in the direction of a more fruitful investigation. Perhaps I read too many similar books, but it seemed untrue to the Davenport character for him to concentrate so utterly on a fruitless investigative path.Unlike some reviewers, I didn't mind the ""female"" subplots as much, and I am happy to see some hint of a Weather return to the series. I was a bit disappointed, though, that the maturation of Lucas in regards to women was ignored in this installment.Overall, I found this an enjoyable read, but definitely not up to the standards of earlier ""Prey"" novels."
2,Weak Prey,"Okay, this was by far the weakest of the Prey series. Where shall I begin...It seems that Davenport is getting soft. Maybe that's how Sandford wants to portray Davenport, but that maybe a stretch. For me what makes a ""Prey"" book good is the cat and mouse game the killer and Daaavenport play. (See Eyes of Prey and Mind Prey) But with Easy Prey, it wasn't there. It was Davenport looking for the killer. Whick leads me to another point. Who the killer was....kind of weak. It's an interesting concept, but rather weak. I also didn't like the idea that Daavenport was going with 3 women. I can't say much more without ruining a plot line, so I'll just end this point. Which leads me to my last point. I *hated* the end! I can't tell you fine readers how much it bothered me. If you want my suggestion, don't waste your money on the hardcover. Maybe, and I mean maybe, get inin paper back. In a few months or so, look in used bookstores, and pick it up for a few bucks, or borrow it from a friend."
3,Better than the last one,"Despite the comments of some of the other readers, I actually enjoyed this one a bit better than the last. At least Lucas is back to bantering around with his co-workers, and his ambivalent relationship with the assorted women in his life is pretty interesting. However, in these days of AIDS and unsafe sex, it's interesting that Lucas runs into bed with Jael with no sense of consequences - since she seems pretty indiscriminate about her sexual partners... I liked the fallible nature of Lucas this time, though, and the plot was pretty interesting. Agree with the editing comments though - how can these big name publishers get off letting these errors go by?"
3,Not his best Prey,"This book started out with promise but failed to live up to it in the end. For the most part, Davenport stays true to his character but Sanford has him reacting in ways he hasn't in the past. The reasoning behind the murders of Maison and Lansing were never fully developed. The final ""suprise killer"" and his capture was also a bit unbelievable. Sanford has written better. Better luck with the next one"
3,A little disappointing - Davenport's still great,"This is slightly more difficult to follow. It seemed as though Sandford perhaps rushed the writing of this one. The characters are not easy to keep straight at times and a few times you think you're reading about one when it's another and you must back up a bit. Still, let's face it - we Davenport fans are going to read all of them! And we can't expect them all to be superior in every regard. But I am not making excuses, this could be more polished, but you will still enjoy much of it."
2,Uninspired Prey,"Yes, Lucas Davenport is still an interesting character, but this time out things got messy. At first I was intrigued with all the subplots, especially with Lucas and his women. The romantic in me fervently hoped that he and Weather would reunite. By the end, though, Lucas had become a calculated user. He really wanted to figure out how to engage all of them. He doesn't deserve Weather.Worse, though, Sandford's usually intricate plotting and interweaving of characters was missing. In its place was a mess. It's not that an investigation wouldn't be messy in actuality, but this one had the normally insightful Lucas jumping to all sorts of lame conclusions.In the final analysis, Sandford no longer seems to respect his own creation. While Lucas Davenport has had a very hard edge in past novels, there was also a weird morality to the man. He was never quite so shallow and trivial as he is in Easy Prey.Please, John Sandford, either revive Lucas or kill him."
2,not Carmel and Clara,"After Sanford's last book, with Carmel and Clara as the Oh-So-Wonderful-Antagonists, I was looking forward to the new Sanford. This book was a big disappointment. Lucas Davenport seemed to be scurrying around looking for LOVE. He could't make up his mind. I didn't like that about him. I wanted him to be strong...I started thinking about him as shallow. Too many characters, too many murders, too many lovers. The ending was disappointing. His last was SOOOO good...this one SOOOO bad. Sanford, don't go for the bucks...plot your story out like the last book. We value your reads."
2,This book is a disappointment,"Having always been a ""Prey"" series fan, I rushed out to buy this last installment when it first hit the stands. However, this book does not measure up to his previous titles. There are way too many characters and Lucas is involved with way too many women. (Am I reading a mystery or watching Days of Our Lives?) The ending virtually assures that a reader will purchase the next installment, but I will be hesistant to spend $ on mediocrity."
3,"It was ok, but not my favorite.","Easy Prey was good but definitely not my favorite in the Prey Series. This one was relatively slow moving with the investigation, in my opinion. Davenport's escapades were the most entertaining part of this one along with the very ending/resolution of the case."
2,"The two star "" I don't like it"" rating says it all....","I love John Sandford books...at least most of them. This was a real disappointment. This is what I call a true two/too star book. Too many characters, too many plots, too few connections, too far fetched. Too much gratuitous sex, too little character development, and too easy to put down.Sorry, John. I know you did better with later books. Perhaps you listened to your critics and if so, good for you. Enough said."
2,"If I were reading it, it would take me three days!","I listened to the audio book and all I can say is- S-L-O-W start! After the first 15 minutes, the story slows to a crawl. A whole lot of useless, inane information that will later have no bearing on the plot is added, seemingly just to fill up air space. If I were reading the book, I probably would never have finished the story, it was that bad. The third and forth hours are the highlights as the bodies pile up, but the story then ends too abruptly with a character introduced 15 minutes before the book ends. Wholely disappointing leaving too many unanswered questions, and no clear villain. I'm still trying to figure out who killed who! The only redeeming quality is that it filled the time driving from NJ to NC!"
4,Lucas Daveport solves another one,"I loved this story by John Sanford. I like many others have listened to many of these stories out of order. I had always wondered how Marcie got injured.In this story you follow the life of Lucas Davenport again, while he is trying to help figure out who has killed a supermodel. Not only that but there seem to be a lot of twists and turns and different people being killed. You will find that in fact you have 2 different killers at work which makes the story much more interesting to follow as you try and see who will put the entire story together.John Sanford does a good job explaining the settings as well as the people so that you can create a whole picture in your mind."
2,The Worst So Far,"Hated it!! I gotta tell ya, I have either loved or strongly liked all of the Prey novels up to this point. This one was so incredibly BORING. I don't know what happened. To me it seemed like the ending was tacked on. I gave it two stars only because of the personal drama going on in Lucas's life. There was very little suspense and so much repetition of incredibly boring, complex real estate deals. Just a total waste of time. I wish I had skipped it."
2,Can hardly get through it....,"I have been zipping through the ""Prey"" series and have been loving every book. And then.....I hit this one and can barely get through it! I'm glad to see I am not the only one. If this is your first attempt at a ""Prey"" book please just start with the first of the series and don't judge Lucas Davenport or John Sandford by this attempt."
3,"Disappointing if You're a ""Prey"" Fan!",Suffice it to say that Mr. Sandford's Easy Prey was not up to his usual high standards. It was extremely difficult to stay with this one. The plot was convoluted beyond what it takes for a great whodunit. The characters are contrived and Lucas Davenport seems more preoccupied with the women in his life than in solving the murders.
1,The only Sandford Book I didn't bother finishing,I wish that I had read other reviews before purchasing this book. This Prey book doesn't belong in the series. Very confusing and a huge let-down. I will never again automatically purchase a John Sandford book and will probably take him off my favorite authors list.
1,"Easily the worst book in the ""Prey"" Series.","Easy Prey is a waste of time. The Prey Series always grabs my attention and I purchase a copy of the book as soon as it becomes available. Easy Prey is in a word - Terrible. I think John Sandford got tired of writing it and just wanted to get it over. The ending is a total letdown. This is the last time I will purchase another ""Prey"" book without doing a little checking. Fans of this series seem to be totally in sync in their comments on just how bad this book is. Hopefully Sanford will get the hint and return to his high standards. I do believe his web site was closed down after his TV Movie was panned."
1,"Terrible, Terrible Book","I have always awaited John Sanford's next book.How disappointing this book was!He has always kept readers intrigued with the plot. In this book he resorts to sensationlism to sell his book. If you are a reader who gets into a book for a real good plot, don't even pick this up."
1,Disappointed!,"Hi all,get a pen and paper..you will need it to keep track of the number of characters coming and going (getting murdered) in this supposed to be mystery thriller.It does not fall into either of the two categories,first of all its not a mystery by any standards and far far behind being called as a thriller.I think its high time John sandford change his style of presenting the novel..rather than writing it as a mystery its better for him to introduce killer in the first page and then start it from there.Don't get excited reading the reviews of double murder and the hunt for the killer,in fact I totally lost how many killings take place in the novel one after the other and the most annoying part is the ending which is a big letdown.After going through 350 odd pages,I think the reader should be atleast given a good ending,but no..its really disappointing.The same thing happened with 'The Night Crew' and it is repeated here in this novel.So my final advice is avoid this novel at any cost."
2,I Tried To Like Easy Prey...,"I really tried to like this latest book of John Sandford...however, I began reading it on a Friday and on the following Wednesday I was still slogging through it. This is a bad sign. Usually I finish a Lucas Davenport novel in one day! I was very disappointed. I did finish it, so there is that! But it just wasn't what Sandford is capable of."
3,not the best Lucas Davenport novel,"Fans of Lucas will want to read this, and I am definitely a fan. But this is not up to Sandford's usual standards. Lucas (and the plot) wander aimlessly through this book. It seems as if Sandford was just throwing in any plot element that occurred to him while he was writing. And isn't it time for Lucas to either commit to a relationship, or stop beginning one with every woman he encounters? Lucas is too fascinating a character to descend to a soap opera type life."
2,Where is the REAL Lucas?,"I love the Davenport series, I look forward to each new book~I even toyed with the thought of buying Easy Prey in hard back....so very glad I waited! My copy came from the library, I couldn't wait to return this~I usually read the newest Davenport in one day...this took forever! I kept losing interest, it just does not live up to the previous books. I almost didn't finish the book, but I kept thinking~this has to get better~it didn't! Please bring the REAL Lucas back!"
2,not the Davenport I once knew!,"I was very disappointed in the main character. Lucas seemed to be hollow and false, four letter words was not his style in the past.This plot made Lucas seem not too intelligent, not really caring. His in and out referenences to his personal life was only distracting.The ending was out of left field as if the author felt it was time to end this story, it was long and tedious and repeticious. hopefully, Mr. Sandford will take a good rest and his next offering will go back to the quality Davenport. Ill patiently await the next novel and will continue to be a loyal fan."
2,Letdown,"There are Davenport novels that are pure whodonits and there are Davenport novels where our hero plays cat-and-mouse against a fully developed antagonist. This is neither. More convoluted than clever and more exhausting than exhilarating, Easy Prey is the worst Davenport novel since Night Prey (best in the series are Rules, Eyes, Silent, Certain and Winter). Sanford is a very talented writer, but by the time i reached the left-field climax, I truly couldn't care who did it and who lives or dies -- I just wanted it to end. The reader practically needs one of those connect-the-characters charts that Davenport used to hang on his wall to follow a case, yet your patience and close attention is never rewarded. Chapter upon chapter of pure dialogue detailing investigative procedure punctuated by skimpy action scenes and a hodgepodge of thin, sensationalistic characters."
4,Another great John Sanford novel,"John Sanford's ""Prey"" novels are among the best thrillers being written today. All of them are exciting and Lucas Davenport is a great lead character (not as great as Travis McGee of course). The only reason this did not get 5 stars is because his previous novels have been a bit more exciting. But any John Sanford novel is better than most."
3,Surprisingly Disappointed,"I am an absolutely huge fan of Mr. Sandford's Prey series, but this one let me down! The story and plot was good and I was really into the story til near the end when it seemed that since every character was getting ""knocked off"" a nobody was picked out of the air to become the main killer. It was reminiscent of Patricia Cornwell's latest works. Disappointing! To destroy a perfect story with a mundane ending such as this one is a letdown. Hopefully the next one in the series will be better."
2,NOT HIS BEST EFFORT,"As a fan of all the ""PREY"" novels, I found ""EASY PREY"" to be Sandford's worst. I thought there were too many characters & the plot was somewhat confusing. Did this novel go thru the editing process?"
1,BORING,"I am trying to finish this book, hoping that something exciting will happen. It is as bad as ""Night Crew"""
3,Not his best,"I was so excited to see the latest installment of Lucas Davenport's adventures. But I was slightly disappointed. Sanford did a pretty amazing job with keeping the murderer underwraps by throwing many curveballs at the reader. It was until the last chapter or two that the murderer is finally revealed. However, I didn't find the characters as gripping as he has written some before.I thought this book would carry on the same tone and pace of his previous book, Certain Prey, but that was not the case. I was also slightly put off by how the author concludes the book with Lucas caught among 3 women in his life. It seemed like the middle aged detective was going through a mid-life crisis with settling down with a woman. Is Lucas going to be a family man soon? I guess that could be the next stage of development a character will go through. But I liked the raging and passionate Detective about his cases, not this ""I'm torn between these 3 women,"" guy."
4,Enjoyable read,"Lucas Davenport is back in good form. This was an enjoyable novel and a fast read. A little hard to get caught-up and hooked at first, but soon it develops into a fast-paced book.Look forward to more of his novels with this interesting character, Davenport."
3,Rough language and too much sex,"I have read every Prey novel to date. I liked the inricate plotting, dead ends and false leads. I thought Sanford was very sophisticated in what he did with regard to the bad guys.However, I really could do without the graphic sex and copious uses of the F*** word.I know Mr. Sanford has said in interviews that he toned down Lucas Davenport after the original Prey novel, but the wild man still has to be there somewhere! Go back to women with power drills and silenced .22's."
3,Not his best... but better than many author's very best,"The latest in the prey series is certainly not the author's best effort. In fact it seems possible that it's a rework of an earlier unpublished version. However, John Sandford at this less-than-best is far better than many authors writing in this genre. Now - to wait for the next one!"
4,I even recommended it!,I am surprised at the number of less than positive reviews...I didn't compare this novel to any of the previous ones although I have read them all and found this one to be a good mystery. Seemed to hang together. Different style but nonetheless not a waste of a few hours.
3,Not at all impressed with this one,"This is not one of the better Lucas Davenport novels as a matter of fact this has to be my least favorite, I didn't care about the charecters the plot was just okay, but the worst part was the ending, I enjoy mystery novels where you have an oppurtunity to figure out who done it this one does not provide that. I give it 3 stars as I am a fan of the Prey series and do enjoy reading these novels, but the ending on this one seemed forced."
1,Who wrote this book?,"I can't believe that John Sandford actually was the author of this book. It doesn't read like a Sandford. I would definately reccommend skipping it. It offered nothing to the Prey series. It never got moving, it introduced numerous redundant characters and went into the last few pages before introducing the villian. Readers weren't allowed to become acquainted with the villian at all. Didn't follow the rules of a good mystery. Extremely boring."
1,too difficult to listen to,"I usually enjoy John Sanford's books and looked forward to listening to this one on tape. However, I gave up after struggling through cassette one. I thought that maybe it would make more sense if I could read and reread the passages in the printed version. But after reading the other customer reviews, I don't think that would have helped. I will just skip this one and hope John Sandford gets back on track."
2,Easy Prey is not an easy read,"I have read all of the Prey books and enjoyed them tremendously. I was eager to read Easy Prey but after 100 pages I was puzzled. It did not ""grab"" me at all. Too many characters to remember.The story lumbered along for about 170 pages when it got a little interesting. Lucas seems to be burned out, both as a police officer and as an attractive hunk. I am anxious to finish this book and go on to better fiction."
2,"Whatever Happened to the ""Old"" John Sandford","It is with deep regret that I am posting this review... John Sandford's ""Prey"" series was an exciting, innovative, suspense series in the tradition of Lawrence Sander's marvelous ""Deadly Sin"" series... unfortunately, Mr. Sandford's latest is easily his worst....The plot is thin and drawn out... there is little or no interaction between the characters that we have known over countless novels... and, it is even worse when the author cheats and reveals a suspect who is not even contained in the first three quarters of the novel...A lesbian sub-plot is thrown into the novel just for the sake of luridness, and plot threads are either left hanging or under-developed.I can only ""prey"" that this series improves."
3,Disjointed Prey,A huge disappointment when compared to the earlier Prey novels. Too disjointed with too many characters. Also Lucas seemed more interested in deciding which of his ladies to favor than in solving the case.
3,"Like a great meal, with a mediocre dessert","I'm a big fan of the ""Prey"" series, and one who would like to see these make it onto the big screen. The latest book really held my attention with a deviant set of murders, and multiple suspects. Quit reading this now if you don't want to know about the ending....However, the last 50 pages of the book are a letdown, as Sandford brings in a new character past page 300, which seemed like a copout to me. Here the reader has invested a good 300 pages in trying to figure out a rather complex mystery, only to be given a cheap way out. This is what kept the book from getting a 4 or 5 star rating from me.As other reviewers are mentioned, too much time is spent on Lucas' lovelife. Do we really care? Or do we like Lucas the cop more? I prefer the cop.If you like the series, buy the book, the first 330 pages are a good read, just be ready for a weak ending."
1,Easy Prey -- The end of the series?,I love John Sandford books. This is the exception. Introducing a new character in the last few pages and having that character be an important part of the book is unfair. The thrill is in the clues and the chase -- not the quick and meaningless ending. I hope the next book shows more or the originality exhibited in Sandford' earlier books. I will read the next book with a bit of reluctance.
2,Steady Decline,"I am--or should I say was--another major, long time fan of John Sandford and Lucas Davenport but this latest book-one with the greatest of all PREY title--has cured me of that. The plot of the book just does not make sense and characters wander in and out of it with senseless abandon. It appears to have been created by requesting his word processor to put together a plot and descriptions of characters--in one place Weather is described almost identically in paragraphs only half a page apart--continuity issues abound. Very disappointed--wish I had borrowed this one from the library so I could have returned it."
2,Not as good as his other Prey books,"This Lucas Davenport book is not nearly as exciting or gripping as most of his other books in the Prey series. The plot is too scattered, and Davenport's women problems seemed superficial and forced. It almost seemed to me like the relationship stuff was added as an overlayer in the hopes of reinforcing a loose and weak plot. The ending was very contrived and thus very disappointing."
1,A Major Dissappointment,"I am a big fan of John Sanford and the ""Prey"" series. Without a doubt, this was the most dissappointing of the lot. I didn't even want to finish reading the book (whereas in most cases, I can't stand putting them down). Bland unsympathetic characters, little suspense, few surprises, and Lucas just didn't ""strut his stuff."" Best advice: skip it."
1,Worst Prey Yet,"This has to be the worst book in the series. It lacked action and seemed to be designed to keep the reader off track. There is no way you can put clues together and try to figure out who the killer is. The confrontation in the gas station was so cheesy and unrealistic and the book even ends on a sour note, if I could get a refund I would. I wonder if author got a bonus for writing another Prey book so soon. I am a huge fan of this series, but I was very, very disappointed with this one. As a matter of fact I plan to go back to the first couple of books just to recapture the excitement missed in this one."
1,Couldn't finish it!,"I've always liked his books but like so many of my favorite authors he's produced something unreadable. How does that happen? How is it possible that there are others here giving it 5 stars and calling it ""unputdownable""? There were so many characters... I counted 8 different characters mentioned on one page. I read 225 pages ... skipped to the end and gave it a toss. Should have read the reviews first."
1,Easy Prey-The Reader,"I have read all of the ""prey"" books and this is by far the worst. Davenport has become a political animal and the fact he is juggling three women even lowers him more in my eyes. The plot is boring-put me to slep every night after a few pages...so and so went here, called so and so....no clues to who the killer(s) is/are....I had no sympathy for the victims, either. I can't believe I paid hard cover price for this!"
1,"The Inevitable, Ultimate Disappointment","I have read all of the previous books in the ""Prey"" series by Sanford and have been thrilled, frightened, and amazed by his work. Unfortunately, my previous experiences with Sanford did not prepare me for this poor excuse of an effort. The plot is obvious and even if it wasn't, you wouldn't care. The characters, even the formerly ever engaging Davenport, are wooden to the point of being comical. We can only hope Sanford got the bad one ""out of his system"" and that his next effort will again enthrall us."
2,so disappointing.....,"I have read and enjoyed all the previous ""prey"" books...but I just could not get involved in ""Easy Prey"". There were too many subplots with new characters being introduced continually. There was not enough time to digest each character as he/she appeared. Luke meeting so many of his past lovers was also a bit too much. He seemed quite unfocused. It was a real struggle to get through this book...something unheard of in a ""prey book""...what a disspointment!"
2,disappointing prey,I saved this new prey for my vacation. I was not inpressed. I thought the story took off well and grabed my interest. But the ending was not Mr. Sanfords usual. There was no way the reader could be the detective. The bad guy was from out of the blue. I have to say that it seemed Mr. Sanford is trying too hard and cranking them out too fast. Slower is better.
2,EASY PREY NOT EASY TO READ!!!!,"I have read all the Prey books that are out. I guess I liked this one least of all. Alie'e Maison is murdered and the town goes wild. She is so famous, but Sandy Lansing is murdered at the same time. Who really was the killer after? Many more, and I mean many more are killed. [...] It got very confusing with so many people and really two stories going on at the same time. Lucus was having trouble with which [...], I could do without that. I guess in this book he things he is a gift to women. The ending was strange, came out of nowhere. Sandford has done much better, in my openion. Will try one more and if like this will move on to something else."
3,Lucas Davenport's Love Life,"I really had to force myself to finish this book. It is only the second in the Prey series that I have read, but after reading Certain Prey, it is a disappointment. I listened to it on audiobook and had a terrible time trying to keep up with the characters. I wasn't able to go back and look up the names again, so struggled a bit that way. Sandford didn't really take the time to develop the characters, which made it hard to feel much empathy towards them. Plus the fact that all he could seem to think about was which woman would he sleep with. He had the friend ( a fellow policewoman who was shot), the model (who he did sleep with), the Dr. (who he thought he might marry if she asked him) and his old girlfriend from his college days. I, like other reviewers, just really didn't care much about the people in the story and the action just didn't interest me. It sounds like the previous Prey books are more worth my time and I'll have to go back and try them."
2,SANDFORD'S EASY PREY,THE PREY BOOKS HAVE BEEN MY FAVORATES FOR YEARS. IT IS A SHAME THE DOLLAR PUMP HAS GRABED ANOTHER AUTHOR. WE AS READERS CAN GET TRASH IN ALL SHADES AND SHAPES. WE HAVE TRUST IN SANDFORD'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE SOMETHING OF HIGH QUALITY AS IN YEARS PAST. HERE IS HOPEING HE WILL.
2,"Sort of, Kinda, Would Be Prey","This Prey novel starts with a so-so premise, with a model getting killed, and Lucas Davenport investigating. The novel has some okay twists, but its nothing special. We get within 20 pages of the end, we think we know who the killer is. Then, out of the blue, they say the killer is some body, who, up untill this point, had never been mentioned. Not by name, nothing. When I first read it, I went, who? All and all, and okay novel, ruined by an awfull ending."
3,Allmost Prey,"This book could be summed up with one word, allmost. It allmost had a decent plot, decent ending, and was allmost a decent Prey edition. The problem? The killer is revealed, tweenty pages from the end. The killers, who's name had never been mentioned before that point. All of a sudden, Wha? Whos that? That's the killer? Where did he come from? Useually, I don't let the ending ruin the book, but this ending was so terrible."
2,Convoluted Prey,"What started as an interesting enough murder case quickly deteriorated into hundreds of pages about drugs and real estate that just bored me to tears. The characters were flat and the star of this book was Lucas' new Porche. Having read some of the later entries in this series, I'm glad to know that the series picks up again."
4,Clear as Chrysta!,"Often categorized as Pop-Jazz, here in Asia they are quite popular(specially Japan). While Workshy may not have consistently great material (i.e music, lyrics) found in any single album. Chrysta Jones' voice is definitely something worth keep coming back for (also the reason I have Soul Love, Allure, Under the Influence albums in my collection). They are best with upbeat music like Say a Little Prayer, If I ever Lose This Heaven, All is Fair in Love, Work To Do, But Alive."
2,Too much recycled content.,I have been waiting to see what would be included in this set and its a great disapointment. 4 out of the 5 games have already been released on other Mets DVD sets. The higlights films from the early years are interesting but still not worth the price if you have the other Mets DVD sets.All the games from the 1969 World Series do exist in fairly decent shape. Why couldn't MLB release that entire Series instead of one game on a previous set and one game on this set.
3,Good stuff but much was available separately before,"Not much material included was any different than previously released videos. Forme, it was just nice to have them on DVD instead of my old VHS items"
3,so-so,"2 of the dvds i already have from other mets dvds, but overall i liked it, loved the season highlights"
1,Not worth a dime,"I thought this would be a great deal, but it turned out to be utterly worthless. The car charger did not work at all and the earpiece would not even plug in. I did not plan on using the cover anyway so that is worthless to me as well."
1,Useless product,"I order this item again for to replace the previous same item, because the previous was defective. Now the new one too is defective. The headset is not fitting in the phone. I am too disappoined with the product quality, this is purely useless and I will not recommend anyone to buy. I strongly demand amazon, not to sell this product on their site and loose their credibility."
2,headset does not fit,"The headset does not fit into the nokia 6682. The car charger is working at the moment and the case fits the phone alright even though with the case on the phone, the reception is sometimes reduced. Take the case off and reception is increased.It looks like the only problem is with the headset. However, the good thing is, buying the 6682 comes with the headset so it is not really a problem.All the same, in order for amazon to be the place of choice for shoppers, this combo needs to be taken off the website. It is only reducing amazon's reputation for providing exceptional products and services. I got this combo before checking out previous reviews and I regret it to an extent. It's not a bad deal since 2 out of the 3 products work but in order for amazon to have really loyal customers, they needs to do better than that."
2,This cd did not offer enough well known songs..........,"This cd had some original compositions from Danny. I didn't find his compositions that good. Also the overall song selection left a lot to be desired.I think Danny's performance was alright, but like I said, I couldn't give him a superior rating because of the song selection on this cd.I think this could have been a great cd with better songs being performed by Danny.I Can Not Recommend This Cd"
5,Useful and clear,"Warfel's two books are useful for an entry-level understanding of gross muscular antaomy. More importantly, these books are unique in that they indicate the motor points of the muscles, which is useful for providing precise muscular therapy to individuals with nerve entrapment problems or for understanding entrapment syndromes. I have found it most useful when used in conjunction with Netter, Clemente, Totora, etc."
1,falling apart,"The book in terms of recipes is okay, very simplistic and definitely good for a college student with no time or funds. The physical part of the book is falling apart. the day I received it 3 pages came flying out. this continues to happen every time I open it."
4,Vegetarian Cookbook,"A nice, no nonsense book with good easy to follow recipes. Catchy illustrations might help capture the interest for the younger readers!"
5,this is a great book,"I first checked out this book when I was taking the plunge into vegetarianism. I found the recipes tasty and easy. The only problem I had was I do not own a microwave, so I had to adjust and do things on the stove. Now, nnearly four years into my meat-free diet, I find myself living in a cramped studio with the tinest kitchen I've ever seen (my fridge isn't even in the kitchen it is so small). So, I brought ""The Starving Students' Vegetarian Cookbook"" off of the bookshelf and back into my kitchen. The recipes are fast, easy, and tasty-and don't take up a lot of space to prepare."
1,Mecgar stands for Mediocre Garbage,"My first gun I purchased came with one magazine, so I bought this one to pair it with. The follower likes to jam so the slide stop wont catch, which scared me a few times out on the range into several unnecessary brass checks. I expected loading it to be difficult but damn it feels like the spring in it is too damn big for a 7 round clip! I have to force #7 in then if I jostle it a bit the rounds will actually fire out of the clip! WTF!? Needless to say, Avoid this if you own a 1911, you will hate yourself for paying for it."
2,"pretty, but low quality.","The case was pretty. It was larger than I expected. The speakers were mono it seemed. Sound not great. I am not certain what it was made of but it looked like vinyl stickers and I bet the corners will be damaged quick. The inside is all black plastic. The front was metal, which makes it seem a little nicer. Sad that it is not higher quality sound and components.All in all, quality just above kid toy level."
1,Totally Disappointed,"I bought this as a gift....I read the reviews and all of the ratings seemed fairly positive....but when we opened it to try out some new LPs....something was missing....the needle to play records was not with the product....We ended up having to order from Crosley to order a replacement needle....really frustrating when all you want to do is play your records and enjoy some great music....hopefully the actual player works....but for now, I'm definitely not happy with my purchase....especially for paying for something that does not even work....=/"
1,this item didn't work!,"it took too long to get the unit out of the extensive packing, then, all excited, i plugged it in, turned it on...and nothing. it was dead."
1,stack o matic....malfunction o matic,will only occasionaly let the next record drop and if you do get 3 to play the next one slows down the turn table.
3,stacko what?,i gave this player 3 out of 5 stars. took one star away for sound quality which to me was like a C+ not bad but not too good either. my biggest complaint is that my player will not drop my 180 gram vinyl this really bums me out because now i cant listen to any of my records that are 180 grams. Has anyone else had this problem??? solutions if any???
2,Poor product -,This is my 3rd pearls that I have ordered through Amazon and each one I have returned including this one. The item is flawed and not perfectly rounded - returned this too!
1,"A Message to Garcia is ""A RIP OFF""","The book is totally worthless. It is exerpts from Lord knows where. The book is 18 5""X8"" pages of whatever followed by 28 blank pages. I cannot believe an honest dealer would even carry it!A Message to Garcia"
2,Interesting but outdated,"This is an interesting story, but times have changed since it was written. My manager at work gave this to all his employees a few years ago. As soon as I finished reading it, I decided to start looking for another job. When that manager gave us that book, whether he realized it or not, he was sending the message that he wanted us to just do what we were told and to stop thinking about what we were doing. That's not why I went to school.Any reputable company should hire people who think for themselves, who ask questions and try to find ways to do more than what is expected of them. There are too many mindless automatons in this world already. Doing only what you're told without thinking about what you're doing is not the way to achieve success in life."
1,A vain attempt to fictionalize history,"The author evades all but the messengers name. The author even tells us that the facts of the matter are meaningless. The author also fails to tell us that Andrew Rowan was not a 41 year old lt. but a major or a Lt. Colonel. The author also fails to tell us that a 300 lb General & an Admiral made the same trip to meet with Garcia. The author also fails to tell us what message was transmitted. The author also fails to tell us what General Shafter & Admiral Sampson knew about the message, if anything."
4,In your face,"Blunt truths about followership. And about loyalty. Hubbard boils down the lessons learned from this unique situation into simple, powerful truths. This version didn't display well on my KFire HD however. Look for one of the 99 cent versions instead. Well worth it."
5,Must Read,This is one of those books to start handing out to others in hopes they will read and understand. Pretty simple and to the point. Where would we be if we all would just do the work!
4,A must read,"Should be required reading for every American, particularly given today's economic environment. Many of Hubbard's themes are timeless. It's no wonder this is a mainstay on many professional military education lists."
1,Review of the Free Kindle Edition,"I cant say much for the book because I only got a few paragraphs into it. But the free Kindle editionA Message to Garcia Being a Preachmentis not the way to go. It has not been proof-read, and about 3 paragraphs into the story it seams like it skips to the very end then from there who knows where it goes. Plus, something I've never seen before, it locked up my kindle."
5,Message to Garcia,Book was in good condition. Shipping took a little longer than expected I think due to changes at US Post Office. Pleased with the book.
1,Download for free,This is an open source essay and you can download it for free from the internet. Do not buy this.
1,waste of money,"To be quite frank, this book is an utter waste of money. More than half of the pages are blank - wasted paper and space. And on the pages that actually have print, the formatting is simply horrific."
