4,Great but not perfect,"The NUVI is a great unit; no rocket science requirement to get it working out of the box. I live in a rural area of Arizona and several times NUVI has told me to turn on dirt roads that don't exist and it doesn't have roads in memory that have been in existence for the past three years. Going into major cities, it works great; it takes you exactly where you want to go. I'd buy it again in a minute."
4,The Garmin System,"We are very happy with the Garmin GPS unit. We have named her Gloria and she has been very helpful, especially on long trips. We have noticed that at times she uses a path that is not necessarily the shortest or the most direct, however, one way or another, she does not fail to get us to where we need to go. A very worthwile addition to our travel."
3,No Owner's Manual...time delay,"It's unsettling to receive the box without any security tab or shrink wrap. It made me wonder if what I received was a returned unit especially since there wasn't an Owner's Manual in the box. It's true that you can use the basic features of the unit right out of the box, but then you don't know how to use the other features or reset the unit in case you need to. I did eventually find the manual at the Garmin web site.In terms of performance, I've used it for the daily trip to work and it seems to lag behind. I would get instructions about half a block too late; for example, only after passing an intersection would I get instructions to turn.I don't know whether or not I received a defective unit, but it was not worth the $455 I paid Amazon."
3,The Mount falls off the windshield.,The GPS unit works reasonably well but the mount keeps falling off the windshield. I mailed it back to Garmin and am still waiting for a repaired or improved version of the mount to be sent back to me. In addition the unit comes without a manual or written instructions.
5,Garmin Nuvi 350,I have both the garmin 350 Nuvi and the 2720 street pilot. Both are excellent units. They will get you where you want to be Quickly.I use them more at night than in the daytime. Both are excellent.
1,Not completely happy,"We recently used our new Garmin Nuvi 350 on a trip from the southern part of New Jersey to Massachusetts, and we were not completely convinced that we should have purchased the item. On the entire trip along the major highways, it kept telling us to make a right turn at every, and I do mean every up coming exit. It wasn't until we actually got to the town of our destination, and within five miles of that distination, that it actually told us the correct turns to make. I think we should have waited on this purchase until we investigated them more thoroughly."
5,Garmin GPS,"I purchased the Garmin Nuvi 350 GPS unit for my wife. She's extremely pleased with the ease of use, accuracy and overall functionality it provides."
4,Makes finding the way a lot more enjoyable,"I bought this for my husband, who is a trucker (and King of the Road Map!-LOL) He intially said - ""you can use it to navigate your way around NC, I don't need that thing"". The GARMIN is now HIS- he loves it and uses it regularly to find everything in the area where we are moving to. I suspect I'll have to get my own GARMIN. Great buy, priced right! You will find that the landmarks aren't as accurate as the GPS."
4,"Good GPS, and do help a lot","I brought this GPS just weeks ago.It help a lot especially when I drive to SD last weekend. The ""avoid highway"" is pretty convenient that I can get rid off CA-101 during rush time. And the function to find out food location is pretty strong that this weekend I went out for lunch with friends. The problem is they got a wrong address for the restaurant. Every GPS on the car can not help, except mine nuvi 350. :)Here I give one star deduction only because sometimes it seems to take more time to find the satelite signals than the streepilot."
5,Who needs a good sense of direction!,"Great product. I love how no matter which way you turn, it ""recalculates"" (in a British accent, if you so choose!) and gets you where you need to go. Doesn't know all the roads, but it will get you to and from your location. I didn't want a huge screen...smaller is better in technology, right? (unless you're my husband tv shopping)Sticks onto windshield- and my windshield is quite a ways from the driver's seat, but you can still read the screen just fine, I think it's a good size."
4,Great Deal for the price!,"Product is all it is advertised to be. Gets satellite signal quickly. I live in a rural area so roads are sometimes described as ""Road 700 East"" instead of Skunk Hollow Road as I know it, but directions are accurate. MP3 player is not the quality of an IPOD but a welcome addition to a GPS. Would recommend this unit as an excellent starter GPS!"
4,great little machine!,"I bought this GPS after my family all had ones in their own cars (Acura, Honda, Cadillac, and Subaru). It is much cheaper to buy a GPS that you can take with you then buy one from the car companies for alot more $$$. I took it with me to California, NYC, and Florida. It helped me navigate to all different vineyards in Napa and throughout Battery Park in NY.I only wish it could find POI's and directions from your own voice like the GPS's in cars. It would be great to just speak than punch things things while driving.Great item and worth the money."
5,This Thing Kicks Axx,"I've had this for about 2 months. Much better than I hoped. I handed it to my wife as we got in the car (she's not the best with this stuff) and said ""here's the on button"", ""program it to take use to Jims house"". After a 2 second argument she starts pushing buttons, and has it ready to go by the end of the driveway. It couldn't be easier. First question...State? You start to type New J, and buy the time you reach for the e New Jersey is on the screen. Same thing for city and street address. It's so easy to use that I never read the manual. There are many features(screens) that I didn't even know it had. Like touch the screen in the middle and you can drag the map around to look at other places (plus you can zoom in). Satilite position and strenght(not useful but cool). Find food on the road...fast food, Asian, Mex...My only complant... would be nicer with a larger screen... but that's more of a cash flow problem of mine, not the Nuvi. They're made with bigger screens. $"
5,Takes the stress out of travels,"I just moved to Seattle from a small town and was really worried about getting lost in the big city, so i bought the nuvi and have been thanking myself ever since. It's gotten me everywhere I've needed to go without any problems every time. The rest of my family just went on a trip to the Oregon coast(without me), and after a few wrong turns and detours have decided that they need one of these before their next trip. I would recomend this to anyone that does any traveling in large cities or cross country, esspecially for finding restaurants and stores on your trip."
4,nuvi 350 review,"The nuvi 350 GPS navigator works great. The text to speech is an option that you want to have. I found it very helpful while driving the interstates around Milwaukee. Roads to the right, left and straight. The voice prompt or touch the screen to repeat helps to keep your eyes on the traffic. Uploading the recent map online does take a lot of time even with a DSL connection. The initial startup does take several minutes to acquire the satellites."
3,Worth it,"This is my first GPS device, I have used this for a month now, and it's a good product. It's worth the investment.Pros' - Compact and affordableCons - Takes more than a minute to acquire satelliteIf you are looking for an easy to use, compact and affordable GPS, then this is a good choice."
4,EVERYBODY should have a GPS,This was a great investment. It's gotten me all kinds of places and found new and better ways to the places I go regularly. The interface is well layed out and easy to navigate. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect rating is because a couple of times it has been off a bit with exact building location.DEFINITELY a worth while investment!
4,Not too bad if you can get a signal,"I love my Garmin Nuvi 350 when I am on the highway and the signal is nice and strong. I also like that I can find nearby restaurants, shopping, gas stations, etc. We recently moved, so its been a great help. The only problem is that we moved to an area with tons of tall trees, and it seems when I have needed my GPS the most, it is searching for a satellite."
4,"Works great, but not the website","It is everything that everyone has said it would be! It is so ACCURATE!!! ... and easy to use. Just read what's on screen, and you won't need an instruction manual for most of the functions. The only thing that it lacks is that the maximum volume is not loud enough. So if you drive a truck or a compact car that does not have enough sound insulation from the outside, you will have a hard time hearing the Nuvi 350's voice prompts."
4,Good product.,"The GPS is a good product, easy to use and helpful when on the road. I do wish that Garmin would have enclosed a booklet of GOOD instructions with the GPS. I had to run - on its Website - a voluminous manual for the information required to get started; much of the material in the manual, however, is not useful for a novice."
4,Very Good,"Very good , not perfect. It's fantastic the GPS speaking the street names.Battery is not so durable.Enjoying a lot."
4,Garmin Nuvi (Travel assistance),"I just got this GPS and its been a wonderful travel assistant!! From Boston, to Texas to toronto and Philadelphia, it recognizes immediately where I am and has been a life saver.Even though I was sceptical about using the product initially, i've never left home without it now."
5,Best GPS for the price,"Got this nice GPS system for myself at Xmas time and it is a nice looking and came with all the needed accessories, the first time we used it, it helped us to find ways to the car dealer, an Olive Garden, and an asian market in the area we have never been to before in Memphis!Amazon is the cheapest place to buy this, Walmart had it on sale for $440and Newegg for about $40 more, if you are in the market for a good GPS system for your car, this is it!"
1,SCAM Artist,"Ordered a product (Garmin GPS) that seemes like a good price, then received an email saying that it could not be ""shipped to my address.""Either they are doing a bait and switch - or its just false advertising.BEWARE !!!!"
2,Garmin Nuvi 350,Not very friendly for assembling at all. Still need time to complete my review. NOT AN EASY TO ASSEMBLE PIECE in the CAR
2,Stops working after 18 months unless you buy new maps!,"I bought a Garmin 18 months ago. Recently it notified us that the maps needed to be updated. We thought this would happen via satellite automatically. Instead, we were directed to the Garmin web site -- to PURCHASE the update.To get the map update downloaded to the device, we have to pay $70! In the mean time, the device is totally worthless."
1,Sellerman doesnt exist!,This joker (Sellerman)....never responded to my emails........and I never recieved merchandise.....and best yet....I was billed for it!BEWARE of this seller!!
4,I like it!,"I never had something like this so maybe it isn't the ultimate, but I think it works great!"
4,Volumn control,I like it very much but for one thing. There is no external volume Control Wheel like on the 340. The touch screen for this button is a mistake.
4,good,i've not had any major problems with it except that the speaker is not loud for direction giving but quite loud when you are playing your mp3.i like the fact that you know the exact name of the next turn.a good buy overall.
5,easy to use,"I used the GPS for the past month. I find Garmin Nuvi 350 very easy to use. The interface is intuitive. Moreover, it saves me a lot of time; I don't have to print directions from online services like mapquest. The GPS always guides me to the destination accurately. Furthermore, I find GPS is very useful when driving in poor weather conditions (such as heavy snows and rains) and one cannot see very far. I can see the road on the GPS and expect turns and intersections."
4,Easy Compact Navigation System!,"First, great price at amazon. Second, quick service. Third, description of the system was very accurate. Item was ready to use right from the box. Turn it on, push a few buttons, and your off! Battery life is good. I was worroed about the size being too small, however, my girlfriend convinced me to not buy the wode screen and she was right. N need whatsoever for a wide screen. Fits perfectly in a corner or in middle of windshield. Suction bracket that is included is easy to use. On the negative side, few mistakes on accuracy I notice but nothing major. Also, you only get one voice if you want street names spoken. if you want the system to just tell you right left turns, you have the option of a few voices; but not many. You can download additional voices for a price ofcourse! Overall high marks for a simply to use and extremely helpful gadget."
4,Nice product,"It's very handy and seems generally accurate. One problem is that there is no volume control on the 350, so you need to go into the menus to adjust - not good while driving. The satellite pick-up is okay, but a bit delayed. The lack of a good printed manual is a negative, although I think that's the norm nowadays.Considering the original price (around $350), and that Consumer Reports gave it a very good rating, if you can find this discontinued model at a good price (I got it for $150), it's a great deal."
5,Easy to use!,I bought this for my mom who is 66 and she LOVES it! She thinks it's super easy to use and is enjoying zipping around Denver with it. She took it to Kansas City and said it worked great there as well. No problems! I highly recommend this for anyone of any age.
4,Great Value!,"This GPS was a great value. The only down side was that it can take a long time to acquire the satellite and download the maps. I recently traveled to DC. While there, I was in areas of town where the signal strength looked good, but the maps would not download. As soon as I got to a better spot, it downloaded them right away. From that point on, it was great.The best feature was that you could search for things that were in your local. For example, we wanted some Chinese food. The GPS located a restaurant 2 miles away and provide the address AND phone number so we could make reservations! That was awesome! The GPS in my car doesn't even do that.I would recommend this product to anyone.Update 10/20/08I just bought the 650 for my work. It's identical except the screen is bigger. The screen size is nice, but it's too big to sick in your pocket. Because of this, I prefer the 350 I bought for my home best, but it is still really nice."
4,Garmin Nuvi 350,"It's fun being assisted by a talking GPS, especially when one is making detours in order to get away from traffic jams or driving through unfamiliar neighborhoods. The computer may be set to talk with either a female or male voice, with either American or British accent. I have my device set to talk as ""British Emily."" ""Emily"" sounds like a calm female navigator, who sometimes says ""saint"" instead of ""street,"" when ""ST"" follows a street name, e.g. ""South Capitol St.""This GPS device has a built-in rechargeable battery. I wish the built-in speakers were on the same side of the color LCD display, instead of facing the windshield and setting the volume to near-maximum. A pair of stereo earphones [not included] may be used.An external traffic updater device, which plugs into a port, may be puchased separately [subscription fee-required]."
2,Maps for most of the locations in my area are missing,"It's not good for the construction done in last 3 years. The maps are not upto date. This product comes with very old version of maps. For new version of maps, you will have to put another $75. I am returing this product."
4,Good but there are better and cheaper ones,I've tried this one and magellan 3040. Garmin 350 is slower at doing POI searches and do not have a good search engines for its database. It is also more expensive. However it does come with good accessories such as the bean bag stand and it does play MP3.
4,Garmin 350,Good product. I'm disappointed it did not come with the real-time traffic component but otherwise I'm pleased.
4,Nice size,"I really like the Garmin Nuvi 350 Pocket Vehicle GPS Navigator. It is nice and compact, fits in your purse nicely. It doesn't always give you the best route. One time it told me to turn right and I could see the mall I wanted to go to on the left. But on the whole I think it does just fine. I recently went to AZ for vacation and didn't have any problems getting around. Thank you for a great product."
4,Garmin Nuvi 350,"I bought this product a month ago. It is a perfect little gadget, and is very portable. We used it on our recent trips to Vegas and Chicago. It worked great in both the places, except in downtown Chicago. We kept losing sattelite reception in the middle of downtown when we needed it the most. The other drawback is that it takes a while to recalculate if we miss a turn.The best feature is that it tells you the name of the street you are supposed to turn into, as opposed to ' turn in .5 miles'. The screen changes to night mode automatically once the sun goes down. The unit is very user friendly. I am glad I bought it!"
5,time savin g device,"As an outside salesman, I save two hours each sales day when I am visiting an unfamiliar city. This device even tells me what lane to be in when I approach a turn."
3,Some basics missing,"The overall experience is good, but there are many missing features and data that I would call basic must haves.Positives:- Great compact size- Attractive- Easy to view- Fairly easy controls- Voice directions- PortabilityNegatives:- Have to flip up antenna every time- Maps are outdated from the beginning- Many businesses not registered in database- Quite a few addresses not registered in database- No ability to go to cross street or vicinities, have to input exact address and it has to be registered in their database- No ability to avoid toll roads- Have to input state, spell out city, etc. instead of just inputting zip code or phone number- Can only set one waypoint- Takes you on weird directions and not so infrequently- Takes long time to get a satellite fix when turning on far away from where you turned it off- Super expensive map updates"
3,ok but has 2 problems,"We have used this GPS in various US states over the last 2 years. While it has been ok overall (we only use it for directions, not for music and all the other stuff it can do) We have always had the following issues:1. The suction cup suddenly falls off the windshield at times. This can be dangerous for the driver. So now the passenger just holds it in his/her hand and it is not safe if the driver is alone.2. Sometimes the satellites just don't load. This seems to have nothing to do with area (cos it has happened in areas where it has previously worked) or weather.You would be better off trying the dashboard mounted models, at least they wont fall off and hit the driver's face! While this has taken us to many places .. I don't think its worth the money given that these are getting so much cheaper these days."
1,Doesn't take the most direct routes,"Turning it on and off is a problem. Spent 80 minutes on the phone when ours lost maps, only to have more problems. Would not buy another Garmin product. This GPS is like dealing with a stubborn child!"
3,Map updates not available,"Garmin's support is horrible. I purchased Nuvi 350 NA a year ago and was not able to update my maps (I'm leaving for vacation) because I don't remember a username that I used for unit registration. While other sites usually have many automated ways to overcome this issue, Garmin's web site does not make it easy and sends you to customer center phone number.I called it in the morning after they start their working hours (8:00am Central) and hanged down after waiting an hour on the phone. An attempt to email or post a message via web site initiates a quiz with mandatory questions that seem irrelevant and hard to answer. I gave up and rating I'm giving to product is a small tribute to my frustration"
3,Consider Map Updates,"Having owned the Garmin 350 for several years, here's a few considerations: If you know your routes, follow what you know. Garmin (or any GPS) are most helpful when you're in unfamiliar territory. No GPS is error-free. This 350 has nice voice/accent choices, and its feature of announcing turns by street names is helpful. No matter what brand you purchase, first look into map update costs. Some offer one or more free updates. Here, Garmin falls short. If you don't follow their strict rules listed on [...] website, you forfeit your one potential update in 60 days. Then you have to pay $70 for a single update, or $120 for lifetime updates. This is disappointingly pricey. One is tempted to throw away their Garmin and just purchase a new GPS for about the same amount."
3,High maintenance,"My husband bought this for me years ago to be able to find all the different soccer fields my kids played on. It is costly to have to keep updating the maps yearly since there is always so much construction going on, doesn't always have the correct streets."
2,Works well in the US,Used this with Europe maps. Not the best. I suggest you get a EU version at Duty Free shops on arrival in EU. Prices are not that bad is such shops.
5,Garmin Nuvi 350 Review,"Excellent Product. This GPS System is everything that it is advertised to be right out of the box. Very simple to use and extremely accurate. I used one on a rental car this summer on a 1400 mile trip through Washington D.C./ Pennsylvania / Virginia, and I always knew where I was going. I recommend this GPS System to the frequent traveler / salesperson.Carcranbud 9/29/07"
5,Garmin Nuvi 350 does everything you need,"I've tried a few different GPS devices and none of them had text-to-speech, which when you are in unfamiliar areas is fantastic. The only failing is the keys are a bit too small for my hand.Used it for a 2.5 day trip from California to Washington and it performed great even gave better directions out of Portland than the bell hops!"
5,Garmin Nuvi 350,I love this device. I previously had an older TomTom which was decent but this unit's ability to pronounce street names along with an impressive database of points of interest allows me to know any area I find myself in better than the locals. Highly recommended.
5,The Best!!!,"This is the best tech product we have purchased. We have owned it since last summer and have nothing but positive experiences. It has saved us from getting lost many times. We are campers and it finds those some times hard to find state campgrounds. Once we are settled and need to shop we simply enter the store or restaurant and it shows what direction and the distance, press go and we are off again. We purchased a 2 gig SD card and now play all our music while we travel Karen interrupts the music to let us know when we need to turn. We have had zero problems with the nuvi, I wish I could say the same for the ipod nano my wife received as a gift, it's now on the way back to be repaired."
3,Good enough but not perfect,"Pros:- Size is just perfect- Excellent navigation capabilities when working.- Will get you to the correct place 90% of the timeCons:- Not perfect nor 100% accurate. If you use this navigate a commercial plane you have chances of crashing or landing in a residential area instead of an airport,- Unit freezed twice: Once when it got very hot, it brought me back to Kansas (default location) and second time, after passing through a tunnel in San Francisco, it relocated my location to the middle of SF bay!- Cannot use in tunnels, multilevel parking and indoors or you lose your sattelite reception.- Had a hard time catching up with the close roads of Downtown San Francisco. Since the streets there are very close to each other, it fails to tell me the next turn correctly.- Dashboard mount disk will not attach to my dashboard.- There is still a lot of room for improvement in GPS technology but for the meantime, I'm sticking with my Nuvi"
3,Much better Garmin Nuvi values out there,"Having owned this unit for two years, I agree with every positive word. But the 350's time has come and gone. It's time to consider the newer, less-expensive Nuvis out there, unless you can get this for $100 or less."
4,Garmin nuvi 350 is a good buy,"I bought the Garmin nuvi 350 GPS system after a long wait and lots of search. It tourns out to be among the best GPS devices available out there (for the money). The voice activated navigation is good and functional. However, the volume is on the lower side. There is no way one can use it with the windows open. If there is some shining from behind you (assuming the nuvi is mounted on your dashboard), you just cannot see the display unless you keep the backlight on at all times. A lot of times the nuvi takes a lot of time to acquire satellite...a reboot helps but thats pretty sluggish according to me. Overall, its a good buy...worth the money spent on it. If you know what to expect from your GPS, then you should be fine with the nuvi 350."
4,"Superb, but...","I love the Nuvi 350 GPS. I use it frequently and it always finds the best way possible. The only draw-back is its usage when in town, especially near hi-rise buildings, or under overpasses or on/under bridges etc -- where it's losing its navigation and the car in the GPS picture starts swirling and swinging like a drunk without a purpose and you end up missing exits and turns. Otherwise it's well worth the price and I will happily continue to use it."
1,Reroute Reroute Reroute,I was at first impressed with the unit while using it in town to navagate local streets and conditions. My dissatisfaction came while using it on a 1000 miles trip to Chicago. The quickest route was all interstate and the shortest route was all interstate. The unit continually tried to reroute me off of the interstate and onto state and local hwys. It doesn't have an interstate only feature. Every time I would pull over to a rest area it would try to reroute me off of the interstate. This would be a good unit for local travel only.
1,defective screen,"I have the same problem as a customer listed previously - The Nuvi 350 worked fine out of the box, but soon afterward the screen went to very low contrast as though the back lighting went out. I'm sending it back, disappointed."
4,I'll never read another map again,"This product making getting around so much easier and safer. Reading maps on the go is dangerous fumbling with the maps and taking your eyes off the road. I love the features that allow one to find food, shopping, fuel, etc.My only complaint is the 12V DC cord. It doesn't always stay connected to the vehicle's power supply."
4,Great buy,"This is easy to use-didn't even need to read the manual (which you have to download-only reason I'm giving 4 stars-they should include a paper manual for people who don't want to spend an hour online to view instructions).It recalculates easily if you don't follow their directions (they have a good data base of shopping centers, cemeteries, airports etc) but don't have semi-private roads and don't let you input an address that is located on a major highway (at least not the ones I've tried for work trips).Definitely worth the $ and Amazon has the best price I've seen (yet)."
4,excellent product,"this is an excellent product! i bought this going to boston from ny, and it got me where i want to go. the text-to-speech is great! it tells you to make turns within 0.3 mi so you wont miss your exit. this GPS ensures you stay on the right lanes for those highways that like to fork/split into 2. The POIs that come with it is not very updated, but still very useful. the only problem that i had was when i went to a very suburban area in boston where the roads were really short/narrow, that i had a little difficulty finding the right roads, but i eventually did."
4,"Easy to use, great menus and features",My husband and I began using this GPS straight from the box; it was very user-friendly. The only problem we've encountered is that the ETA feature doesn't work correctly when the battery is low.
3,A good basic GPS,"If not being able to input multiple way points is not a problem then this is an adequate unit for you. It's easy to use, it acquires satellites quickly, has a clear screen and good user interface. I returned it because I require a GPS that allows me to input multiple way points."
4,"My Garmin nuvi 350 is great, BUT!",The unit works Great. If you are driving on a fairly new road. It seems to get lost. It's a shame when I did my initial download. It didn't download current maps. I guess they want to sell me the current maps!
2,It worked until it blanked...,"We bought this two years ago...it worked fine until after some 8 months it blanked in the middle of the freeway...(which was, needless to say, very annoying)... it was under warrantee so we got a new one...this again blanked on the freeway... We bought the newer top of the line model several months ago and this one works fine for several months now...."
4,Great help. No more maps for me.,"The Garmin nuvi 350 works like a charm. Distinct, clear easy to follow directions. The hardware rates five stars but I've found a few inaccuracies in the directions, but nothing that was a problem. Great on the interstate highway when you run into a traffic jam. Just hop off at the first exit and the nuvi recalculates the route so that you can drive around it."
4,"Easy to use, very reasonable price.","This is a simple product to use. As technical as something like this might be, they have done a good job of making it easily usable for even those who might be considered technically challenged. Once, this unit appeared to be dead, with a blank screen. I thought it had died but pushed the reset button on the rear and all was well."
2,no sound...,"I purchaed a NEW Garmin nuvi 350 about 6 weeks ago. It took almost 2 weeks to arrive.Once I opened the box and tried out the unit, I found that it had no sound.So I called Garmin and they told me to return the unit to them and they would replace itwith a new one. After waiting another 2 weeks I got a package. Inside was aunit marked ""recently overhauled"". It works fine...BUT, didn't I pay for a new one?If I wanted to deal with a used unit I would have shopped on ebay and probablyspent considerably less."
3,Garmin 350 is ok,"I got this gps few months ago after I moved to NC. I tested it few times and this is my questions to Garmin:1. I was driving on the road which is garmin GPS suggested and suddenly garmin told me to make a left turn. and I slow down and looked around. There was not an open entrance on my left but a two lanes traffic. Isn't scary?2. Garmin cannot find my home address. I know it's a new area but I can locate my home with my iphone.3. I tried to download new map from garmin.com support. After almost a whole day downloaded, it told me I need find 2000MB space on my pc.4. I bought Garmin from amazon.com, Garmin.com only provide free service or download if you buy from their official website after 30 days. Hell no.A lot of features in Garmin GPS you don't really need it. Keep your eyes on the road."
4,Garmin 350 Nuvi GPS,Found Garmin Nuvi GPS 350 to be very functional and easy to use; but do not like the suction mount to windshield. Found weighted dash mount to be much better.
5,My husband loves this GPS.,"My husband's birthday present this year was the Garmin nuvi 350. He travels quite a bit in his work and he says this gift is incredibly useful. If there is construction work he would like to avoid or if he just wants a change of scenery, he can ask for an alternate route and be confident that he will not become lost.I like the GPS because it supplies an estimated time of arrival that is extremely accurate.The only drawback is that it does not have a mute button; you must go through several steps to turn the voice off. A overall great deal for the money."
5,Works very fine!,"Very nice product, lot of functionalities. The sound volume is good.I am using here in Brazil, in Sao Paulo area. Just added the SD Card with the City Navigator Brazil NT V4 and the system recognized without any problem."
4,Does the job!,"Easy to set up and use. Is great for finding locations around the city and metro area. I like the touch screen function that allows you to zoom out getting a bird's eye view of the area. Only complaint, not enough add on maps for this model. What's the use of having a memory slot with almost nothing to use it for!"
4,Here's some Pros and Cons of Nuvi 350,Pros:- easy enough to use- clear voice- no monthly fees- small enough to walk with- Canada and U.S. maps- price ($398 USD)Cons:- voice guidance does not give street name or exit number- cannot talk to it and receive guidance- somewhat difficult to quickly mount and dismount in car- any features you want to download as extras (such as fishing maps) are VERY expensive
5,Good bye mapquest,"As a Realtor, often time I have to venture new territories. Before the Garmin I would print directions from mapquest to read as I drive. (Not safe)With the Garmin Nuvi 350 I always know where I am going. With the voice director I never have to look at a map. When she says turn, I turn and I'm there!I recommend the Garmin Nuvi 350 to anyone who spends time on the road. Realtors shouldn't leave home without one!"
4,Great Product,I purchased this product in Feb 08. It has helped me navigate my way around town. If I make a wrong turn it recalculates immediately.
4,Very good GPS,"Awesome product. This is the first GPS system I have gotten. It does what its suppose to do.I like the compact design. I have mine set to the fastest route and tried it out on a route to my brothers house and the directions were right on. My wife used it to go to a conference for work and her experience was better than expected.I do have one con to the product. I wish it had a text recognition for misspelled words. Or have a ""did you mean this"" option and give you stores it thinks you are looking for. When I misspell a store name or it is not typed in the way the GPS would recognize it, the GPS would spin forever. This is the reason it got 4 stars instead of 5.Other than that my experience with the Garmin nuvi 350 is GREAT."
2,suggested route often is longer or wrong,"I like the ease of functionality with Garmin and find it very intuitive. I especially like the fact that it suggests places in the neighborhood when entering the name.Over the past few weeks however I have become more and more reluctant to using it. This is because several times it happened to me that the suggested route was a long detour to a spot which should have only been a few minutes away. Sometimes also, the route suggestion is plain wrong, nonsense.Garmin should improve the routing system...."
5,Garmin Nuvi 350,"I love the Garmin Nuvi 350. I am going to be doing a lot of traveling and it makes it so easy. You just program in where you want to go and the voice activation tells you step by step how to get there. You don't even have to look at it once it is programmed, just drive with confidence. And if you happen to turn a different way it immediately relocates and gives new directions. The touch screen is terrific."
4,Good Product,"I bought this product 4 weeks ago and for general driving directions it works fine. The Software provides all the basic information I need when I travel (e.g. Food, Entertainment). It is fairly intuitive and easy to setup. Where it should work more precise is in the city (e.g. Denver). It confuses streets etc. The battery life is fairly short but since it comes with a charging cable that's ok."
2,Nuvi 350 GPS Review,"I won't recommend this product to buy because of two major reasons.1. The touch screen is not working properly. It means, if I press down arrow, the system is recognized number 9. It is very difficult to enter exact value what we need. Need to find out to select sharp instrument to select the key.2. some of the address not recognized.I can suggest to buy from stores."
3,USER COMPLAINT,"MY MAP IS OUTDATED BECAUSE ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS, I ENTERED A BUSINESS BY NAME, BUT WHEN ARRIVING, I FIND THAT THE BUSINESS HAS MOVE TO ANOTHER LOCATION.EXAMPLE; WALMART IN SAPULPA MOVED INTO A NEW STORE 6-7 YEARS AGO BUT MY GPS DIRECTS ME TO THE OLD LOCATION.IN HARLINGEN TX AN ADDRESS INDICATED THAT AN ADDRESS KNOWN TO ME WAS NOT FOUND.OTHERWISE, IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO USE BUT OVERALL I'M SATISFIED WITH MY UNIT( WHERE'S MY REBATE??? )"
5,Garmin nuvi 350 review,"Great unit, says street names as well as distance to next turns! I used an SD data card and loaded my favorite mp3's and they play back perfectly. The unit fits in my console and is easy to get out of site when I'm not in the car. The battery life is excellent and the screen brightness is perfect for daytime or night driving. Overall, a great buy and I've really enjoyed the comfort of knowing I can't get lost!"
4,Garmin is Great,"I used the Garmin when I made a trip to Atlanta, it was great. It named the streets and gave me plenty of time to be prepared for the turns. I never got lost once. I would recommend this to anyone. It is well worth the money."
5,nuvi,"We have been very impressed with the routing ability, and the amount of local information already loaded is amazing--hotels, restaurants, even grocery stores and shoe stores! It is easy to use."
1,"wrong product sent, taking forever to get my refund processed","wrong product sent--taking forever to get my refund processed--not a favorable experience. Had to pay shipping cost to return product. Did not get an Amazon representative to handle the error. Amazon was a thrid party in the transaction.Purchased thru Amazon, Wrong product Sent by Deal Stop, I Returned wrong product to Deal Stop, Notice of refund sent by Legendmicro that refund was processed back to my Amazon account, no conformation sent by Amazon----Is this how I am expected to do business with you?"
1,Big Rip off!!,"I bought this GPS almost 2 years ago. What a rip off!!! It was okay but the directions where really weird. Leaving from my home to go the supermarket should have been a straight shot, it keep telling me to take all these side roads that just added time and miles to my trip.Then tried to upgrade the maps by purchasing and downloading the new one - well that did not work on a Mac or PC. Contacted Garmin - no response until I contested the charges on my credit card. Then they emailed me a fix that still did not work. Told me to call them - was on hold for 1 hours before I had to hand up. Chucked the whole idea of an updated map.Then the other day it was showing to turn right but speaking turn left and then the whole thing just died. Extremely disappointed in this product. Replaced it with a Tom Tom 730 with a lot of neat features and free map updates!!!"
3,depressed,"Although the nuvi 350 worked extremely well. Tne first week that I recieved it, it was stolen! That ends my review."
2,Why did I get a Garmin?,"I have an inherit fear of using this product because it was giving me the wrong directions within my local neighborhood....Someone told me that I should update the Garmin by uploading maps from their website. Now, mind you the guidebook does not recommend that one should do so, it felt rather implied...in any case I took the relative's advice and did so....sorry to say I had to pay for this service which is not mentioned in the guide. I haven't tried it out again...when I do, I will decide whether or not it's a worthy companion or dump it and ship it back."
4,Very Helpful GPS System,"I don't typically use a GPS system all that often unless I am going on a trip out of state. This system is very handy since it says the street name rather than just ""Turn left"" - the only drawback is it doesn't give a large heads up when to turn usually .1 miles in advance turn left on main street kind of deal."
4,good product,"I bought this GPS last Feb 2008 and have loved it. I did have one problem a big one, traveling to Auburn,IN the Garmain took me off the route in the middle of a blizzard. It got me back on the route but it was not a plesent experience. Since then I one problem with the unit but a call to Garmin fixed it immediately.I have lent the Garmin to other family members who loved it. This Christmas I bought the Garmin 350 for my Son and Son in Law. I wouldn't have bought 3 Nuvi350's if I didn't think it was an excellent product."
4,Very Nice Product,"I would have given this product 5 stars, however, it does not always give you the fastest route. Ex.A friend of mine lives in CT about 1 mile from exit 2. However the Nuvi tells me to get off at exit 21 (in NY) about 3 miles away. This is the local route which takes about an additional 10-15 minutes. Oddly, when coming back from his house it tells me to get on at exit 2. I played around with all the different route options but it still tells me to take exit 21. If i ignore the instructions, it then tells me to get off at exit 2. this is just one example. However, it still gets you to where you want to go. Overall, it is an excellent product, and fits nicely in my pocket."
4,Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator,"The Garmin nüvi 350 works well and is better than the older larger Garmin GPS that I have. With its small size and battery power, one can take it anywhere."
4,350,"This product has some nice features to help you get where you're going, however, I would suggest having a map and a good idea where you are going to begin with. If you take a different route than what the 350 tells you to, it seems to be pretty stubborn in trying to get you back to that route instead of finding a better one from your current location.All in all its a good product and is probably the best you can get for around $200."
5,Met my expectations,"The Nuvi 350 shipped when it was suppose to, it was in new condition and functioned properly. This GPS model has met my expectations."
5,Garmin save my sanity while driving home post thanksgivin traffic on I-95!,"I absolutely love this GPS. When I decided to get a GPS, i purchased one from a well known electronic store. I realized afterwards that it didnt have as many navigational features as this Garmin 350. Its so easy to use. My 9 yr old sets it for me sometimes."
3,"Great interface, but not perfect","I bought this for my motorcycle because it claimed to have an 8 hour battery life. I figured that I would never ride that much at once, so it should be fine. I found out that it dies after only about 2 hours.. big letdown. However, if you plan on using it in the car, you can't go wrong for the price.. it's got a great interface and is easy to use."
3,Very good but not as good as possible,I bought this unit as an upgrade because I own a Tom Tom 1 and it is a basic unit from Tom Tom and mine has a battery problem.The Nuvi is a better unit but not that much better for the additional money spent.The unit doesn't call out street names and is slow to aquire your current position if you have moved from where you last used it.Over all it does work well and you get what you pay for.It is a step up in proformance from the Tom Tom that I Had.I would buy the next model up from this if given the chance to do it over.
3,Just OK,"My device has some major problems acquiring satellites and directing me to some locations. I have been testing it in and around Southern New England (Central Connecticut, Central Mass.) and have had some significant problems. In one instance, for example, it could not find Auburn, Mass. -- a 16,000-person suburb of New England's second-largest city (Worcester) which is a main access site for the Mass. Turnpike. In addition, it sometimes takes 15 minutes or more -- and the occasional restart -- to acquire satellites in and around Hartford, Connecticut. I am not yet at the point where I feel comfortable relying solely on this GPS to get me somewhere, although once it's working it does seem -- usually -- to send me the right way."
4,How did we live w/o one?,"Pros:It's accurate, has good points of interest database, quick to respond, nice screen even in sun, very portable, and user friendly.Cons:Like most GPS systems - sometimes the shortest route isn't necessary the easiest, also satellite load time is sometimes slow, but is excusable for the value."
3,GARMIN NUVI 350 review,"I have had both the Garmin 350 and Magellan 700*Garmin Pros: Much smaller size than Magellan, portable (Magellan cannot run on battery), attachment to windshield is more secure and doesnt bounce as much as Magellan*Garmin Cons: the computer is really stupid. Magellan gives you options, short distance, fastest time, most use freeways, least use freeways. In contrast GARMIN has only shortest distance and fastest time. On several occasions, it has picked 'dumb' routes that resulted in ton of traffic or lots of local streets. Magellan's navigation computer is much smarter. If you had two drivers, 1 with Garmin and 1 with Magellan, the Garmin driver would need 1.5X the amount of time to reach its destination. Sometimes its very frustrating but Magellan has own setbacks (mainly really big and heavey). I would NOT recommend this product. Magellan's navigation computer much smarter."
4,"Great Item, Great features, High Price","I gave it 4 stars because of high price. The item works good. Good GPS i use it for 3 weeks and extremely satisfied!But there are few things which should be adressesd.1-For this price I think that FM transmitter should be included. There is no point to use MP3 if you cant play them on cars radio.2- Mp3 player doesn't playmor ethan 500 songs, with new software update.3 Picture viewer a bit slowOtherwise it is a great unit....."
2,Led astray sometimes,"Inconsistent. If I stray only a bit off the defined path the directions tell me to turn off at the next intersection and return home or some other place. The maps are of little use; the directions better, but I am not willing to put blind faith in this mechanism nor is my wife."
3,it is just an OK GPS,"I bought this 350 for about 3 weeks, not really satisfied. I would like to point out some bad things about it and you can figure out what the good things would be so that people can think if it is worth to buy it. First, this GPS shows you to turn on ""No Turn"" intersection. Second, its pre-installed map is not updated so that search for specific address is not available. Third, comparing the direction shown by 350 and Yahoo! map, I prefer Yahoo!, because this GPS just calculates to give you direction to your destinations. It does not give you the best directions. The directions from Yahoo! are very easy to follow and drive. I would recommend people to look at the cheaper GPS."
5,"great product,but a newer model is coming out","The nuvi 350 has all the features I thought I might want (except maybe a camera), but the next model the 360 looks even better. Do a search for the ""garmin nuvi 360"" on Amazon and you'll see that it looks just like the 350 but also has some other features, like the ability to make phone calls through it (provided your cell phone is Bluetooth enabled).I wonder if the Bluetooth capabilities are only for making calls, or if you can transfer data too. They both look like great products, but I think I'm going to wait until the nuvi 360 comes out."
5,Great Product,"Great Product, Easy to use, Super Portable. I took the Garmin out of the book and pluged it in to charge. Once fully charged I powered it on and in less than 5 min. (after the initial set-up) It was ready to go. It has many options for languages, I used it in English and Spanish and it worked great!"
4,I no longer get turned around....,"I no longer get turned around! This is a great device, the only complaint I have is the same as the other reviews. It does seem to take forever to turn on and locate where you are. Once it figures it out, it works great. I have to laugh at some of the pronunciations of street names, especially highways with numbers.I recommend this device - it is a must have for people on the road a lot."
4,He likes it.,"I bought Garmin nuvi 350 for my husband for Christmas and he really likes it. He used it to go places that we already knew how to get to and it works wonderfully. There has been one problem with one place that we were going it said that the street didn't exist, and even when we got there it didn't have a name for the street. But that was the only one. Even if you make a wrong turn it quickly calculates a different route to get you there. We also love the turn by turn talking directions so you don't have to try to focus on the map to see when you have to make a turn it tells you in advance. It has also been helpful in trying to find restaurants and getting the phone numbers for places you want to call and order take out but may not be exactly sure of the name. My Dad seen it and loved it so much he went and bought himself one the next week. Now I'm just waiting for mine :-)"
5,Nuvi 350,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my directionally challenged girl friend, even in her own neighborhood. It proved to be easy for her to use and has given her a new freedom to 'go where no man has gone before'...yeah, the Mall."
5,We love this!!!,"So fun to use this thing, even when we know where we are going. The spoken street names are SO much better than not having them. Recalculates quickly and is very accurate."
4,Nuvi 350,"Shipping was a bit slow, but the Nuvi 350 is great, however I can't get it to navigate to the intersection of two roads. I can't believe that it comes without an instruction book! You have to go online to the Garmin website to view it, and then it's larger than I'd like to print."
1,Screen was defective -- Had to return unit,"Beware of Gold Box Deals! My Garmin nuvi 350 GPS unit arrived on schedule, but was defective. Could not read screen image even after charging unit. I needed the unit for a trip I was taking and cannot wait for the 30 days Amazon requires to replace a defective unit. Some purchases are just better made in a brick & mortar store!"
5,Garmin 350 Pocket GPS,"My daughter just started to drive and I had an old navigation system in the car she drives and she was getting lost everywhere...for hours. I purchased this, after reading all the reviews, and she is so incredibly happy and isn't getting lost at all. I am purchasing a new car and the car dealership actually recommended the 350 for what I needed instead of buying the $2100 navigation system that can be installed in the car. I found Amazon was the cheapest. I guess I am purchasing another one."
5,Best purchase I ever made,Great product! I travel a great deal for my job and this Garmin Nuvi 350 is the way yo go. Great quality all the way around!!
4,Three trips using GPS,"Overall this is a useful product. Some aspects, such as changing time zones, are not automatic. Pronunciation of street names not always correct. Otherwise, this product functions as an excellent GPS system. Claire"
5,Never lost again,"If you are the type of person who has no sense of direction, then get this Nuvi 350 Navigator. It lets you know how to get to one place from another. If you miss a turn, it will recalculate, and put you back on track. Whom ever created the navigation system is a genius."
1,Very disappointed,"I noted the great reviews for this product before I bought it. The unit I received had very low volume. It could only be heard by setting the unit at top volume, and even then the volume was often drowned out by street noise. More importantly, the routings chosen by the Nuvi were far more indirect than google maps or than my old TomTom.I returned the unit after trying it out for two weeks."
3,garmin 350 review,"works very well in major metropolitian areas however not so good in rural areas. does not adhere easily to dash,,,, information material lacking......"
4,Finding my way,"At last. I am looking for a quicker way to get there, or an easier way to a new place, this GPS is great. It fast and easy to use. The screen is large,and full of color. My only complaint is when I want to go a certain way, and it wants to go another. I wish after a certain amount of time of going in that direction it would learn to go my way. Oh well,can't have it all. No other complaints, it is great."
4,Very good,This little gaget is very small but works very good I use to get lost before but now there is no way with my new GPS navigator. I recommand it because it helped me so I know it will help anybody.
5,Great,"I originally ordered a TomTom One over the Garmin Nuvi 350 because it was cheaper, but that was a mistake. It gave me awful directions, and the maps were out of date. One road where I live is about 5 years old, and the TomTom did not have it. The directions were so poor that I would have preferred printing directions from Yahoo instead of using this device.I ended up returning the TomTom and getting the Garmin Nuvi 350, and I am much happier. The Garmin has the road that the TomTom was missing, and the directions are much better.Garmin, most other GPS devices, and web sites like Yahoo all use Navteq maps. These are considered the best. The TomTom uses TeleAtlas, which aren't as good in North America.The Garmin was definitely worth the extra money."
5,GARMIN FIRST TIME USER,"I RECEIVED MY GARMIN NUVI 350 JUST BEFORE MY TRIP TO GETTYSBURG. IT WAS VERY EASY TO SET UP AND I AM ""TECHNOLIGICALLY CHALLENGED""! IT WAS A GREAT HELP AS WE DID GET OFF THE ""BEATEN PATH"" A FEW TIMES AND GARMIN BROUGHT US BACK (EVEN THOUGH SHE DOES SAY ""RECALCULATING"" IN A VERY DISGUSTED VOICE EVERY TIME YOU DON'T DO WHAT SHE SAYS!). IT WAS ABLE TO FIND LOCAL GAS STATIONS, RESTAURANTS AND POINTS OF INTEREST. I ALSO USED IT TO FIND A VERY OUT OF THE WAY CHURCH FOR A WEDDING. IT WAS A GREAT INVESTMENT AND I KNOW I WILL USE IT MANY TIMES IN THE FUTURE (EVEN IF I DO GET CHASTISED FOR WRONG TURNS!)."
3,Garmin Nuvi 350,"I didn't love the nuvi as much as I thought. Here are some issues I've encountered:1. Takes forever for it to locate satellite (and I live in the city)2. The touch screen keyboard isn't accurate. Whatever letter I press, I get the letter below it. Happens all the time with the same letters! Takes about 3-5 tries before it gets it right and I don't have big fingers! Also typing with my nail doesn't work either! Very annoying!!3. Unless it's because I have an older model and the maps aren't updated, the directions to my house and the highway are not accurate.I don't fully trust the nav and I still google the directions and that was the whole point of buying a nav!"
4,Garmin Nuvi 350,"This was a gift for my spouse who remains delighted with it. We had a lot of fun playing with it, putting in addresses and seeing its response. The other reviews were right on, and our experiences were similar. One thing we did not anticipate is that the software version for this Nuvi purchased in September, 2008 was dated 2006! and many addresses are not available. A search on the Garmin site said that he'd need to spend $60 to get the current software. We were not pleased. However, when he registered the product on the Garmin web site a one time free version update was offered which he immediately accepted."
4,Great little GPS,"In one sentence: I like it a lot.Pros:It's super easy to use it, 'even my mom can operate it'. The maps are very detailed. You can find almost every place, restaurant, gas station, you name it. Seriously, if all you need is a GPS for directions, then this product may even be an overkill, get the 250. It plays MP3s from an SD card, and it pauses the music to give you directions. I use it when I am riding my motorcycle too: I leave it on my pocket, connect my earbud to the 3.5 mm audio plug and ride listening to music, and never miss a turn.Cons: You can't program a ride with several stops. But I knew about the limitation, and the fact that you can save dozens of favorite locations diminishes this. On a multiple stop trip, every time you stop, just click Menu - Where To - My Locations - and chose the next stop."
3,2 out of 3 worked,Bought 3 of these- 2 work fine one did not work even after replacing battery. We'll see how long the others last.
2,Okay but not great!,We bought one of these at Home Depot since it looked neat. It worked fine for a year and matched a mechanical unit we have on our shed. A year later it started drifting so we changed the battery in hopes of fixing it. It didn't work and honestly was hard to read in bright Sun or at night. We are looking for another suction cup door unit that is mechanical.
3,like others have said..,this is hard to read if it is a dreary day or dark out.. I haven't painted mine YET.. probably will in the spring :)nice size digits though!
2,Not Happy with Accuracy,"I now have 2 of these thermometers, thanks to a replacement sent to me by Chaney because the first one wasn't accurate, but neather is the replacement. I live within 3 miles of an offical weather regestered station in Pecan Grove Texas called lonestarweather.com. These thermometers are never close to the temp recorded at the weather station. I placed them on a double pane sliding patio door facing north, under a covered patio where the sun never shines so I could get an accurate reading. Today, this morning, they are 5 deg. higher than the weather station, They look nice but can't rely on them for accuracy.Update;After 10 months the batteries are dead, so I went to Walmart for new batteries only to find out the battery cost almost the price of the thermometer. Back to the spring or liquid design."
2,Lasted less than one year,"Bought two of these January 19, 2008, one for each side of the house. One stopped working in July. Replacing the battery did not solve the problem. Last week the other one dropped off the window and the display is now distorted. Since the batteries cost about the same as the device, we will not replace the second battery, but replace the devices with tradtional thermometers. Agree that the display is difficult-to-impossible to read after dark."
5,"No problems, easy to use all year long","I have two of these units - both are working just fine after a year with temps from -10 to +100, no adjustments, the suction is still holding, and the readout is still big and bright."
1,Poor quality control,"I really need a thermometer like this. However, this is now the second time that I have had one sent that was defective on arrival. Not sure why there is such a lack of quality control on this item.....First one would not turn on. THis one has burnt out display. Most of the digits are not showing----"
1,Quit working,After a season of use it died. Besides being hard to read (you shouldn't have to paint the thing to make it readable). Worked through the winter but when we had 100+ temps for a few days in June it died. Thought it was the battery - replaced battery for $5.99 and still not working. I would buy something else.
5,Nice LARGE numbers!,Love this lil thermometer! I can read the numbers from across the room~ They are about an Inch in size and I love it! It even reads the same as what our News says the weather is! I like it and the ease of placing it on any window!
2,Daylight and warm weather use only,The digital display on this thermometer works only in daylight and warm weather. At night it is unreadable even with a flashlight. In cold weather the display gets so dim that it is also unreadable.
2,Cute idea - but it's just not accurate right outside the window!,"I was skeptical as to the accuracy of the temperature and it turns out I was right to be. This thing runs 5-10 degrees warmer than the actual temperature outside in the winter. This isn't really the product's fault, it's just common sense that the air RIGHT outside my window is going to be warmer than a few feet outdoors. But I couldn't rate it very high because I was disappointed - there should be a warning or tips about how to get the accurate temperature. It was a waste of my money, because I don't want to have to guess whether it's off by 5, 10, or some other numerical degree!"
1,Hard to see,"I had this thermometer for about a year and it only fell off the window once, but I found the display hard to read as well. As time went by, it got worse and worse, until I couldn't see it at all. I finally threw it away the other day :-("
1,WATERPROOF?? NOT!,"I bought this item about 2 months ago. It was just fine until 2 days ago when my town had downpour rains for a week straight. 2 days ago I went to look at the temp. on it & found that that there was no temp. reading at all on it. Rain had gotten into the so called"" WATERPROOF"" part & damaged the whole thing. I would rate this product a - 10 if I could. It doesn't deserve 1 star."
1,horrible,"This thing will never give you accurate readings especially if left in the sunlight, temps can be 20 degrees off! I wouldn't recommend this thermometer!"
4,Low Tech Rules!,I love this on my window by my computer - just don't have it where the sun hits directly :)
3,Outdoor Window Thermometer,"It makes a good cheap gift. It's more like a toy. It isn't that accurate and you can't read it if it's not sunny outside. But for the price, I really can't complain"
3,usefull but not perfectly accurate,"usefull but not perfectly accurate. it's great for putting outside your window to know what to wear when you wake up without going outside or opening that window, but i wouldn't use it if you needed to be consistantly accurate with the temperature."
4,Good buy,Inexpensive and accurate. It's not the Cadillac model (no light and in direct sunlight it shows an inflated temp) but it's a solid Toyota. You can't beat it for the price.
5,Great thermometer for the price,Provides the information I need at an unbeatable price. Numbers are easy to read during the day. At night it's easy to read as long as there is light outside to create enough contrast.
5,Great product,"I have this product attached to my window or doors at all my homes around the world. I absolutely love it, especially when overseas and you have no idea how to convert celsius to fahrenheit numbers."
2,Don't Get These Wet,"This thermometer worked fine for months, attached to my kitchen bay window under a roof overhang. I agree that the numbers are not as defined as in the photos, and you cannot read them at night. One big storm, with rain blowing sideways against the window, obliterated the readout so I had to throw it away. I do not plan to buy another thermometer of this design."
1,the suction cup is not weather resistant,"The LCD screen can be read only from a perpendicular angle.The plastics suction cup is very weak, and will completely loses effectiveness after several weeks of 10 degree day-night temperature changes."
3,Battery Life,"Very happy with this product but do not know how to change battery. Other review said changing battery was easy, I have not found this to be so. Appreciate any help."
2,thermometer,"Not worth much,, did'nt last very long,, hard to read,, won't buy another,, over-rated and almost useless.,, this says i need 3 more words,, hope this works."
3,outdoor thermometer,very inexpensive and I think pretty accurate but really hard to read at night even after pasting white paper to the back.
2,can't see in dark,"Useless at night, completely unreadable when dark outside. Is affected by temp of window, but that's to be expected from a cheap stick on window thermometer."
4,White Paint,"Good product...but, luckily I read the review about painting the back of the AcuRite 00799 white so that it can be read at night. Seems the manufacturer should do that before the product is sold."
2,Junk - display problems after 3 weeks,"Looks good, neat display, but 3 weeks after I got it we had our first small rainstorm. The rain got this a little wet (really, just a little, it is partially covered by the soffit) and the display stopped working. I brought it inside and shook it upside down to get the water out and it started working again within a few minutes. This is not going to be a fun game to play. Not even worth trying to get a replacement with the warranty as I'm sure it'll be a hassle and not worth the 'transportation costs and charges for returned goods' - from the limited warranty: ""Transportation costs and charges for returned goods shall be paid for by the purchaser."""
2,"Ok thermometer, wouldn't buy again","From the start it was hard to read this thermometer unless you were looking at it from the perfect angle. The suction was pretty decent, only fell off a few times in the couple of years that we had it. Now the numbers are fading and it is nearly impossible to see the temp unless you are looking at it from the side. If you look at it straight on, there is nothing. It worked for awhile, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Works until it doesn't,"Fail! This thermometer works great. Then it doesn't. We had it for one year in New England. Worked through the humid heat of summer and the nightmare winter. Then, it looked like it needed a battery replacement. Got a new battery, and found that it wasn't the battery, but the unit that had just gone haywire. For the price, I expected a few years. Maybe it is good for a year, but I'm sure there are others that you can install and forget about."
2,Ok Thermometer,This looks cool and works in theory only. I put it in a south facing window and its reading thrown off significantly by the sun. It can be up to 20 degrees off.
4,Worked for a year,"The suction cup holds very well and this thermometer has worked for nearly a year now. You can see clear to the other side, so I needed a bit of color contrast so I could read the temperature in the evenings, too. I applied some glow-in-the-dark paint to the back side of the display and that solved my problem.Several thermometers that I'd had before this one were heavier than their suction cups could support, so they were often falling off the window. This is the first one that has not been a problem in that way.I used to be able to stand about 15 feet away from it and read the temperature from this thermometer.I was very happy with this until a month ago. It's been working for about 11 months and now, the LED is hard to read. You have to get about 1 foot away from it to see the temperature."
3,Not a bad thermometer,"I received one of these as a Christmas gift about a year ago. It is pretty accurate and has never fallen off of the window. I would give it five stars except two of the LCD segments have gone out. Also, you can't see the temperature if it is dark outside as the thermometer needs light from the back side to be visible."
1,"looks great, but inaccurate",Sometimes it is 10 degrees colder or warmer outside than it says. I need an accurate thermometer because of my horses. + or - 10 degrees is very inaccurate and renders itself completely worthless. I think it is getting heat and cold off my windows; which are double pane.
1,Worthless Product,"These outdoor window thermometers SEEMED like a good idea, however, they're worthless! The LCD display is NOT bright like shown in the picture. The numbers are so light they are totally unreadable. Also, the suction cups will NOT stay stuck to a cold window. I'm returning them."
2,Good at first,"I agree with ""worthless"". Very hard to read except on strong light days. Once it fell off the window it was not totally digital again...(Partial number segment reading). It seemed handy to use but not consistent. ....and how do you change the battery?"
3,Not bad for the price,"This little thermometer is not bad for the price. I haven't had any problems with it sticking to the window but the numbers aren't as dark as shown in the picture, more a light grey color. I chose this item because I had hoped it would be easier to read than my previous thermometer which had very small numbers. It is readable, I blocked out the back side as another reviewer suggested and for the price it's OK."
1,This airplane will drive you CRAZY! You touch it and everything falls off.,"I have always heard Playmobil is supposed to make wonderful products. I was excited to start my sons collection with this airplane. Man was it a mistake! The actual toy would be nice if you were able to keep it together. The tail falls off, the wheels fall off, the wings fall off...in about two seconds I am left with just a fuselage. I think this airplane is made to just sit on a shelf and look pretty."
3,"Nifty design, a few minor FYIs","My 34 month old son loves this plane, he swooshes around the living room carrying the passengers from air-port, to air-port.The only down-side is that the top tail piece, and sometimes the wheels, will become detached if he holds the plane using those parts. He has mostly compensated and learned to hold the plane with the more solid parts (the wings particularly appear to be hard to unseat) and only occasionally forgets and pops off the tail.The roof is detachable, but its too hard for his little fingers to remove, so expect to have parent-child bonding over the toy until their fingers grow stronger.Assembly was not too difficult for anyone who can follow a Lego kit - YMMV."
3,expensive,brought for my son from his santa list. very well made but playmobile toys are twice as much as other simular toys?he played w/it for about ten minutes & ended up on the bottom of his toy chest! could have spent $15 on another airplane w/ the same result.
5,Well designed,"It took maybe 10 minutes to put this item together on Christmas Eve. There were more parts than I had expected and the plane was also larger than I had expected but this turned out to be perfect for little hands to fit down inside of. The wheels roll and turn Very smoothly. The plastic is heavy duty and will not be breaking in our lifetime. While the wheels occasionally come off during a 'crash' and sometimes the tail has fallen off, I believe this is what keeps the toy from really breaking. It's a good design and the kids 3&5 can usually put it back together themselves. The top comes off, the side door opens and there is a luggage compartment in the back."
4,It's fun!,"This airplane is very durable! If it gets dropped, the pcs. pop off and you just stick them back on! My 3 yr. old thinks it is a lot of fun!"
4,William Shakespeare: A Light and Enlightening Look,"This is by far one of the best resources I have found that explains not only what it was like to live during Shakepeare's time but also what it was like to work or go to the theater. Elliot Engel gives startling information about the origins of ""the box office"", ""meat pies"", ""break a leg"" and yes, even ""Ketchup"". My Middle School students find it facinating."
1,Disappointment,"Never have I been so disappointed with an educational video the way I have with this one. Honestly, if you have any knowledge about Shakespeare do NOT buy this. It is simply a man standing in front of a fireplace repeating tidbits about Shakespeare that is common knowledge for most English teachers, though what takes him an hour to tell would take the average person 20 minutes. Engel is a far cry from the reviews you will find on the back of his DVD. I was more annoyed by the end of it than enlightened and refuse to show this to my students because I think of it more as a punishment. All I wanted was a good intro to Shakespeare and instead I wasted about $20."
2,"American Movie Classic type movie, not an airplane movie.","This video was interesting in a couple of areas. It has early appearances from Clint Eastwood, Tom Laughlin (Billy Jack), David Jansen. Some of the early training flights are interesting in their realism. But, it is not a movie for airplane buffs. Or WW1 historians. Or war movie fans. It is a love story based on a young American boy, who makes some mistakes, fights with his father, and runs off to join the war. While there, he falls in love, makes more mistakes, grows up, repents, etc.... everyone lives happily ever after. American Movie Classic buffs will enjoy it (once). Airplane buffs will hate it (wrong airplanes). WW1 buffs will hate it (no history here, except opening credits). War movie buffs will hate it (they call that a battle scene?) Two stars is all I can give. END"
4,Final Film from the Director of WINGS,"William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman directed 1927's WINGS the first film to win an Academy Award. ""Wild Bill"" Wellman was a real life Ace in the US Army Air Corps in World War I. He was wounded, went to Hollywood and ended up a prolific and hard edged director. It would seem fitting that Wellman's last film would be LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLE. Unfortunately Wellman's status as a director had greatly diminished in Hollywood and so was the budget allotted for this would-be epic. Wellman tries to put what style he can into the aerial sequences but essentially this becomes a standard wartime love story via Tab Hunter. The film still boasts good photography by Cinematographer William Clothier and a score by Composer Leonard Rosenman and has an excellent cast including Clint Eastwood, David Janssen, Paul Fix, Will Hutchins, Tom Laughlin, Bret Halsey and William Wellman Jr."
4,Great Video,"This video is great for those beginning to pole dance. The DVD does move a little quick at times and will have to be paused repeatedily after each move to give time to practice, but KT breaks down the moves in a way that is easy to master and is absolutely excellent! Definitely a must have for the novice pole dancer/exerciser."
4,Great for Learning on Your Own,"I just started taking pole dancing classes back in November. After a month of so, only learning a new move once a week wasn't enough for me. So I decided to pick up this DVD to pick up the concepts of getting into other poses on the pole. This is a great DVD! She provides warm ups and conditioning exercises to help improve your form and she also has step-by-step instructions on how to do each move. This is great if you want to learn on your own.Just like another reviewer noted, I thought that the pace was a little quick, so you would have to rewind to see certain sections again just to see the form and the spins. Also, I wish that they had a different background music selection - the song that constantly plays during the fitness instruction does not feel ""sensual"" at all. It was more...""aerobic-fitness"" like."
4,Loved it! Great for Beginners...,"Great training DVD!! Each move is broken down into steps and there are tips on how to execute each move correctly and safely.I was very happy to see warm up and conditioning exercises included on the DVD. There are great exercises to help improve your form and strength-which you will definately need if you want to stay injury free!Like another reviewer has already said, the background music selection stinks, and it gets old quick! Other than that, it is a very ""Beginner Friendly"" Pole Dance Instructional DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to try Pole Dancing."
3,Pretty good,This video is pretty good... They play the same music the whole video somitmgets annoying. All the tricks are done step by step and are easy to follow. Overall this was a good video. I didn't so much enjoy watching the man pole dance :(. It was t attractive and it was just weird.
5,Excellent Training Tool,Found this course to be an excellent training tool for the seasoned and beginner prayer warrior - it has changed the way we pray and has deepened our faith.
5,Bible Prayer Study Course by Kenneth E. Hagin,I really enjoy studying Kenneth Hagin's study books. I always learn something that encourages my faith in Christ Jesus. I would highly recommend it for new believers.
5,Transformers Energon: Looking to be not too shabby,"Here it is, the Transformers Energon Inferno figure. I was not disappointed when I opened him up. In fact, I was immensley impressed. This figure is very cool and bears a slight resemblance to two characters from the G1 toyline: Ironhide and the original G1 Inferno. As far as design goes for this figure, it was done very nicely-a transformation style similar to G1 but with the great poseability of the later Beast Wars, Robots In Disguise, and Armada figures. Also, the fire extinguisher/cannon that is mounted on his arm can be removed if you do not find it to your liking and can be mounted on the back of his shoulder or be used as a hand held weapon, a nice feature IMO. Although I haven't tested it yet (and I don't want to), it seems that this figure is very durable- the plastic is very thick and tough. All in all, I highly recommend this figure to all and is a nice addition to the Transformers line."
2,Fun toy...but the ball joints come apart too easliy!,"My son got this toy for his birthday and loved it. Unfortunately, the parts come off easier than I hoped they would. He did not play really rough with it either-thus the disappointment."
5,HUGE!!!,"This is super cute and so soft! He is really big, great for snuggling. Purchased for xmas for my 7 years old hope he loves it!"
2,Missing pages,"This is supposed to be the definitive work on quillwork. What is there, is excellent. What is disappointing is that instead of 48 pages, there are 13. I sent the first one back, thinking I had just gotten a bad copy but the second one also only had 13 printed pages. I think Amazon should check their stock of this book."
5,One Word: Utterly Amazing...,"Ok so that's two words, but who cares! This is a thrilling read from page one. The story line grabs your attention from the get go and doesn't let go at any point of the emotional rollercoaster. As many reviewers have already pointed out, Ms. Ruiz has almost certainly created a work of art akin to that of the Da Vinci Code. Whereas Dan Brown focuses on religion and science, Ms. Ruiz focuses on Art and Art History. Nonetheless, the emotions, drama, suspense, action and unpredictable twists are ever the present. As an avid fan of suspense and thriller type novels, I completely recommend this book to any other fan of the genres. Eleven out of ten."
5,"Having paid his dues, will Luther get his just reward","An excellent LP. I saw Luther in Philly with the Allman Brothers, Mississippi Fred McDowell in 1971.This LP is a fine indicator of the talent of Luther Allison , seldom recognized or played in the current upswing of popular blues."
5,Awesome CD,Luther Allison-Soul Fixen' Man is fabulous blues that you feel to your bones. Nothing more needs to be said.
5,Six Hours into Joyce's Workouts,"I have been doing this workout in conjunction with Joyce's Bone Building Workout, and am very pleased with the results. As I wrote in my Bone Building Workout review, I have more strength and energy than I ever had doing aerobics alone. Also, despite having approximately thirty pounds to lose, I'm in higher spirits with weight training. It feels great to be firming up areas that I thought were going to be forever weak."
2,"A little air brushing and face-lifting go a long way, Joyce!","I got this book and literally followed her program step-by-step for 6 weeks and I have seen very little results. She claims that her program is a fat-burning program (and weight-lifting can be) but this program should not be touted as such. I have personally been on a strict diet and followed this book to the tee and gotten nowhere fast. Don't let the air-brushed body on the cover deceive you, most people will not look like this in 10 minutes a day! After following Joyce's program rigorously for 6 weeks, I can see no visible difference in the tone and shape of my flabby physique. I also did not experience more energy. Unfortunately this book makes claims that are not altogether true, especially for those of us with more than a few pounds to lose!"
1,"Nope, nope, nope!","I bought this book, and true, I found it helpful. The abdominal and leg work really helped. However, after reading Joyce's writing style, off I went to Walden to return it. She actually ADMITS to encountering a woman in a dressing room who looks her size, and asks her what size she is and her weight, and then says ""I weigh the same as you, but I am a size 3."" What got me about her observation is how she tells the reader how bad this woman looked. Don't judge!! That passage got me to return the book. If you want to keep a good body image, don't read this book."
3,Not too bad,"This was an interesting American remake, but the original French film was far superior, in my opinion--get that one instead."
2,100 minute study,"This movie is a study of two interesting characters, an old professor who over-thinks and a young bank robber that would rather not think, crossing paths when they fear end is upon them. Flanged electric guitar chords set the mood. That's all 100 minutes of it."
1,Not Worth the Effort to Watch,"This film could have been a promising remake of the French film, but falls flat on its face. Long, unnecessary monologues by the characters fails to make up for the lack of any excitement or action (the actual bank robbery is not remotely interesting and occupies about 10 minutes of screen time). All of the actors are notable and worthy of fine performances, but this leaden script is impossible for them to breathe life into."
3,Sir Robert Carey makes an appearance,"To fans of Finney's alter ago, P.F.Chisholm's novels with Sir Robert Carey, he shows up on this novel on a secondary role, and we do find something about his past. But I did not like this nearly as much as the Robert Carey books. I was disapointed in several things about this book, the plot ends up relying heavily on coincidence, there is a feel of sequel to this book which makes it, and some of the characters were rather unbelievable."
4,From a novice,"I just discovered Acadian ancestry and am searching for my roots. I found Griffiths book to be informative on the contexts of Acadian history as advertised. The text is written for historians and well done, but it assumes too much knowledge of Acadian history for a novice. It would also have helped to have the French translated into English."
2,Familiar story,"I came across this film by chance. Although made in 1999 its the same story line followed by Partition and Gadar. A Sikh rescues a Muslim younf woman during partition, fall in love, have a child. She is forced to return to Pakistan, he follows. Of the 3 films this is the most authentic in terms of being a punjabi film. Although this is supposed to be based on a true story unfortunately it doesn't represent the trauma that people went thru in partition. In terms of a fairly positive story its ok."
1,Big Mistake,Ouch! This chair was a surprise for my husband who had back surgery 10 years ago. The hope was that the massage would be comforting - not so. The massages were so rough that we were literally pushed up from the chair. Imagine yourself laying down on your back in a hammock. Now imagine someone below you jamming their knees so far up your back that your head leaves the hammock. I think this is an item that should be tested in person and then purchased online.
5,Excellent oil,"This oil is excellent. You only need a quarter size amount to do an entire arm, shoulder,hand and neck massage.The oil itself is quite light compared to other oils and cleans up easier as well."
4,Girlfriend loves it,"It doesnt soak in 100% but also doesn't sit on the skin. It feels nice, and a little bit does go a long way. buying some flowers and spreading them across the bed, and using this to massage your wife/girlfriend's entire body, will create a night she will never forget"
2,Be Aware of the bad batch,"Given all the positive reviews, it must have been a bad batch what I had received. It did have a light woody scent. Not too bad, but when it touched the linens, and I put them through the washing mashine the resulting smell was quite awful. Ruined 2 sets. I had tried washing, steaming, using scented fabric softener, sanitizing in vinegar and lemon juice. Nothing helped. So it must have been one of the components that went bad. As far as massage oil goes, it was not bad - went on smooth, not greasy. But I like EO product better, particularly because it did not ruin my linens yet."
3,skin issues,"Made of natural ingredients and work well, although if you have skin issues you may not want to use these as my wife ended up with some zits on her back after a massage, but a shower afterward probably would have prevented that. All in all good product for the money."
4,"Nice enough, but go that extra mile and offer my value.","No smell, which is nice The lube is great, glide is great, and there is no residue left over. Nice. Why not include a few massage tips on the bottle or enclosure, dare to offer more value?"
5,Pretty simple and pretty great,"Great massage oil, great price for this amount and is lasting us a long time. My husband and I both suffer from very sore feet because of our jobs, and after many by-hand foot massages we decided to try an electric massager to make the job easier. We bought this along with it, and it's been great. There's no weird or girly smell, it washes off nicely, and this is a great price ($10) for this size bottle. We've had it for MONTHS and it's not even half gone, though we do daily foot and back massages. Love it and will buy again."
1,Yuck!,"This massage oil, although it is supposed to be unscented smells gross. It has a stale smell and isn't very smooth. This made the massage less enjoyable because the oil has a weird feel to it. I enjoy giving and receiving massages but this oil makes the experience not at all enjoyable. The oil leaves the skin feeling greasy even when used sparingly. Without even mentioning how I felt this oil to be, my husband also had the same things to say about it.Beware!! It also stains fabric and furniture. I never allowed the bottle to spill or get messy and it still managed to stain my furniture leaving yucky rings. What a rip-off!I do not recommend this massage oil at all!"
4,work well,"These massage oils are made of natural ingredients and work well, although if you have skin issues you may not want to use these as my wife ended up with some zits on her back after a massage, but a shower afterward probably would have prevented that."
5,I have a question?,If you don't have these in stock why do you still have it posted as for sale ??? Do you have a source of supply for these boards I just don't understand how you do business. I have one on order. but what does that mean if you can't give a date of shipping.
2,Not very durable or easy to fly,"This was my first RC airplane. It was easy to assemble, nice power, etc - but once I tried to fly it, it quickly became apparent it isn't really a beginner in terms of controls - the fantail is a little sluggish to respond, and the rotor causes a fair amount of spin that isn't easily correctable.Additionally, the wings are not very durable - since I was crashing it repeatedly, due to the above. The wings started splintering within half a dozen flights - and I wasn't slamming it into the ground on crashes, either. In short, I wouldn't recommend this unless you have an easy source for replacement wings (Megatech says they're available, but you can't order them online). Range is great, battery lasts reasonably long, and the retracting prop design is actually quite excellent. Wish I could have controlled it better."
4,Excellent and Easy reading about Race relations.,A touching true story of a black man who's a little mentally slow and the white family that takes him in.An excellent story for children in their early teens to give them a sense of how life was in the Carolinas in 40's.
2,With Murderous Intent,"As true crime stories go, this was not one of my favorites. The author spends alot of time detailing background on every new detective, wife, bailiff etc. that enters the picture. I prefer when they stick to the subject story and I found myself skipping over alot of detail that really did not affect the main story at all."
2,CV Joint Boot Kit,"Fast shipping, came with all of the clamps and clips shown in the picture along with instructions and grease. However, the descriptions claims that the axle does NOT need to be removed. This is untrue, not only does the axle need to be removed, but the outer CV Joint also has to be removed to slip this boot on! For the price, I guess this is still a decent buy, but was not pleased to find out that this boot required removal of the axle and joint.2 stars"
1,Doesn't mean anything to preorder if it arrives after you need it,I preordered this item and then ordered an identical one for a friend this order still hasn't shipped. I ordered it in October!
4,Army Wives entertainment,Its great to be able to sit down and watch a whole story arc. I hate having to wait for shows to come on TV in Australia.
3,past is prologue,for anyone looking for answers it is always helpful to look at old issues when they were 'hot'. the church has been dealing with hot issues since it's creation 2000 years ago and this book deals with what appears to be so important in our time...womens rights-contraception-etc. i believe a reader will prosper from this read if they have ever been an adolescent and lived to grow through it
5,NiCe,If your lookin for a dope underground tape with some fast (I mean FAST) cuts look no further. Melo-D's holdin it down for the beat junkie crew and HIP HOP!
5,Add This Season To Your Collection,I know many people look at Season 7 as kind of a downer but it's only because the other seasons were so great. Yeah I thought this was a hum-drum of a season but after a while of seeing it in repeats it really grew on me. Now I can't wait to add Roseanne Season 7 to my collection and I hope you do to. Many great moments to be seen on this dvd set.
2,Not the best,"It is low-cost, but it is not ""heavy-duty"" as claimed.You need to assemble it using a provided wood screws and it is not that sturdy.The finished unit leaves the rack in contact with the ground, which is not great.Suggest getting a better model for just a few dollars more.Suggest looking for other models with raised rack and those that self-interlock (easier to assemble and lasts longer without screws)."
2,"Good in theory, but not the best design","I have 6 of these racks made 12ft long. Have used for 3 years now, and would not recommend. By design the horizontal 2x4 is supposed to hold the vertical in place,along with the screws, so it doesn't lean out, but with the weight of my wood which is 4ft tall and 12ft long, it pushes them out quite a bit, and then they come apart. Would probably be okay for smaller racks. But there are better designs available."
2,Not the item pictured,"I ordered this to accompany a matching wood rack I bought last year (identical to the one in the picture). The item that was sent is also a 2x4 log rack system, and probably a fine one, but you expect to get what you see, no?I highly recommend you take down the picture and update it with the Rutland product you are shipping."
4,Humorous- Relaxing - Memorable,I thoroughly enjoyed (and remember) the various sayings and such. There were plenty of laughs as well. Good coffee table book.Definately recommend!
4,"Excellent, yet covers only a niche segment","I have read many books on Body Language but i didn't help me a lot. Those are really goods such as ""Secrets of Body Language"" by Allan Pease. The reason is i didn't know practical applicability of those signs.This DVD is a great one, they have taken Professionals to give review and all you have is a first hand information. The examples they use are famous personalities and made this show very interesting. The DVD goes on without boring.The only downside is they cover only a niche segment, mostly Political leaders, Criminals. It would be more interesting if they would have taken business deal environment and Courtship signals, that would be more practically helpful for general public to decipher the hidden meaning and avoid day to day havocs."
3,Breezy coverage,"A colleague in the communication field had recommended this video, so I had high hopes for the content. Although there are some interesting, historic clips, and coverage of a few scientific experiments, the coverage is a bit ""lite"". There are a few too many ""experts"" analyzing footage of famous liars, implying that nonverbal communication is actually a language that can be accurately and professionally decoded. Most professionals recognize that nonverbal communication is highly ambiguous, and this viewpoint was not really detailed here. That said, I did find a few clips worth showing in my communication courses."
3,Communication...,90 percent of human communication is conveyed nonverbally. This doc gives you some facts which may come to be very useful.
3,Secrets of Body Language,"I expected better quality from a History Channel original DVD. It lacks subtitles, which I also expected."
1,BEWARE of this book,"I feel I've been suckered into buying this book by the glowing reviews...The book is large print, anemic content, and lacks any color illustrations or photos.Not helpful or insightful in any way.I wish I could get my money back on this one..."
4,Katamari does it again!,"This is a great game, it's pointless, fun, and will have you playing it for hours. If you've played the others you'll love this one and if you've never played a katamari game just buy this one and start. The game is simple roll and collect things, I know it sounds a little boring but it really isn't. the game itself is sort of long and the eternal levels are good but the controls take some getting used to if you've played the others but if you're a newcomer it;ll be easy. Highly recommended for anyone with a psp."
4,Quite The Laugh,"With fruity characters and fun levels, Me & My Katamari has definitely been worth the price. Katamari literally means a lump or cluster... and that's what the game is about! Rolling around through various scenes, picking up items and building up mass is the name of the game. Honestly, it was quite surprising how fun it is.The drawbacks I've encountered are as follows:-Iffy controls... They take an eternity to get used to, but don't take too much out of the game.-Difficult Levels... If you're easily frustrated, you may want to look at a few gameplay videos before making the purchase.-Load Times... Just a bit boring, but, again, they don't take too much out of the game."
4,Katamari fan disappointed,"I'm an avid Katamari fan. This game was a lot of fun, and very reminiscent of the first two games, but the controls are God awful, and tend to glitch a lot. They cycle through the same three stages over and over again. I don't mind that the music is the same as the first two games. The difficulty level on some stages is out of control.This game was fun, but it could be better. In the end, it was more stressful than relaxing."
3,Stick to PS2 version,I love this game on the PS2 however the psp version is much more difficult to control and perhaps the levels are also more difficult. I found myself stuck attempting the same challenge over and over on the psp whereas on the ps2 version there were (at least early on) more areas to explore and more diversity in the environments.If you have to play Katamari on the road you will get a quick fix with this release however I doubt it will be played for as long or enjoyed nearly as much as the PS2 version.
3,Bloated with Homework Problems,"The most surprising thing was how much of the book is homework problems (blue pages). Viewed edge-on they appear to be ~50% of the pages. Many problems are excessively wordy, fine as novellos but reading 2 pages to get to the issues is often tedious. The text is well written, but I didn't find the subject to have as much meat as other MBA subjects like Finance or Operations Research. I understand it is one of the better books on Managerial Accounting. I have 27 years experience at many companies, so others might find the material more enlightening."
1,Beware of the International Edition if you are a U.S. student.,"While sellers may claim that the international edition is the same as the North American version (ISBN 0-07-297586-5), it is not true! While the content is similar, it is not the same. Just in Chapter 1, the problems do not match up. So, if you are an MBA student in a North American university, I recommend buying the North American edition. You think you will save a few bucks (like I did), but in the end you will have to buy the same edition as the rest of your class and get stuck with two books."
4,Text book,"Accounting for Decision Making and ControlI typed in my CRN number and found that other book sellers were more reasonable. So, I ordered from them. However, Amazon did not mention the other new book was a 4th edition and not the 6th edidtion I originally wanted. Shame on Amazon. Seller had a new book, but wasn't what I expected."
5,Great book!,"The great take away from this book is that executives try hard to achieve the optimal solutions for management problems, but that they seldomly succeed. The reason: they underestimate the creativity of their sub-ordinates (and their superiors).For ages students and lecturers thought management accounting was dull. Zimmerman shows how fascinating this subject can be. The decision making parts show how to calculate optimal solutions for management accounting problems, the control parts make your realize how difficult it is to make the optimal solutions come true. The implication: the amount of consulting work to be done is infinite."
5,"Great Product, fits like it should.","I was a little skeptical at first, but it fit just like the original one. The ends were just a little bit different but it all worked out. Definiate buy if your looking for a cheap replacement."
2,It won't be recognized by my PC (Windows 32/64),"It can't be recognized by my PC (Windows 7, 32bits and 64bits), and no appropriate USB driver be found yet.Useless.I am still searching a driver for it from Sony."
3,IT'S SWEET!!!,"My name is Elina and I just go this spy safe cracker. If you are over 14 years old dont buy it because it would be to easy to break into. You can have all your things locked in a strong vault, you can get it by typing in your chosen PIN. one bad thing is that the vault is small. but it is still great!!!"
3,Fun I think,My 8 yr old son's broke the Christmas day so it will be exchanged but he had wanted one for sooo long. As for teaching him a life of crime? Gimmee a break.It's the families who are not involved at all with their kid's choices that need to worry. We will give this toy one more chance before we make a final decision.
2,Just a toy.,Better than what my brother received. But I'm not so wild with this one either. Not even used or played with for an hour. Not that good.
5,Good info!,I was very pleased with the info in the book. It was practical and it has contributed to me losing a few inches in the few weeks that I've had it.
5,Great Book!,The book is easy to read and filled with ideas on how to live a more balanced healthy life style.
2,Probably not worth the money,"I just received this book and am sending it back immediately. It was recommended by a co-worker. Some of the information is useful, however, much of it is nonsense. The information about calcium is completely wrong and there is very little, if any, reliable scientific evidence relating to food combinations that he talks about. What's really disturbing is that there are no credentials listed in this book for Mr. Lerner and then we find out he's a chiropractor and calls himself a a ""nutritionist"". My best friend is a licensed dietician with a local hospital. She told me that anyone can call themselves a nutritionist. They don't have to be certified or licensed and they don't have to take continuing education like dieticians do. Personally, I stay away from people who call themselves nutritionists. Common sense will tell you that if you feed your body good, natural, unprocessed food you will begin to feel better. Don't waste the money on this one."
3,Good Book,"This is a good book, not a great or fantastic book but a good one. Dr. Lerner does a very good job of presenting healthy alternatives as well as easy to do exercises - even for those of us who have never ever exercised! However he needs to research some of his remarks more thoroughly, like that prior to his generation there was no structured exercise and that you can reverse some hereditary health issues. Like so many other health enthusiasts he thinks it is his way or no way, I was hoping that him being a Christian he would recognize the value of other opinions.Lots of good information, rather narrow view."
3,intersting ideas,"this book has interesting info, unsure if i agree with everything he says about meat, chicken and dairy though. also, not everyone can afford the food items he wants you to purchase, expensive. with our current economy it would be difficult for some people. i think he needs to be more realistic"
5,Great book,"This is a great living plan and a good ""undiet"" compared to all the other diet books around - like anything though, you have to watch how much you consume, unless you are truly burning off calories in weight lifting and working out"
5,"body by god,the owners manual","Life changing!! The book is incredibly easy to read, relevant and easy to apply to your life. I really enjoy how dr. ben uses real life situations to make the points about change. I have seen incredible results. Highly recommend!!"
1,He isn't a Doctor,"I researched this guy. He has a certificate as a chiropractor, but he is not a medical doctor. So I don't know where he gets off calling himself a doctor other than to make himself look like an authority figure. In his book he bashes REAL Doctors and says pills and medication our bad for you, but his own organization sells its own line of pills. The worse thing about this book is that he is using God as a marketing tool, which I think is disgraceful, but apparently it helps him sell his stuff."
1,Too many Assumptions,"This book contains too many assumptions to be taken seriously. The old saying "" give me one false assumption and I can prove anything "" applies to this book. To better understand I use this example.....if you accept the assumption that 1+1=1, then I can prove I am the pope......if I am 1 and the pope is 1 then I am the pope because you accept the false assumption that 1+1=1. You must accept the assumption that there is a God for this book to apply. Don't waste your time on this book."
5,Nice book for beginner rock hound,"This book gives a description of numerous rock & gem types, along with characteristics, pictures, geography, etc. Good book for someone just starting out in the world of rocks. However, it is not helpful for someone with prior knowledge. It is a beginners level book and a really good one at that."
3,Beautiful but not solid,"I love the looks of this faucet but the handles wobble. We bought additional washers to stabilize it and it's better, but still not nearly as solid as I would expect."
3,"Kanguru MP3not bad really, yet not great","my over all experience is positive, though the supplied head set is woefully inadequate, they caused a consistent short that reset the player in the middle of song tracks. Also the user interface is a little awkward at first but comes with experience. Over all the 1 gig of flash memory functions as advertised and gets excellent marks from me. The real seller for me is that it functions well with my Ubuntu Linux box and never fails to upload song or file, as long as you remember to release the hold button on the side(it locks the access to all software/hardware functions).Over all 3 out of 5 stars, reason, its user interface needs to be streamlined to really improve the user experience, and the supplied ear buds are abysmal, but $5.00 and a cheap maxell head set solves the ear bud issue. Really its not that bad, but it could improve."
3,My new Tractor,"My first impression was that the paint job was really bad...I was not looking for a luxury car job but still, this did not sit well as a first impression.My second discovery was that the ball joints for the three point hitch had never been greased. This after reading a check-off list from the seller which listed these as things to be done before delivery. The list was not filled out by the seller and no items had been checked off...so was it done or not?I have yet to try the machine in the field and cannot comment further about that, but the things mentioned above made me feel uncomfortable with it. Before I do anything else I'm going to check out what I can to see if all else is OK, like other fittings and liquid levels."
5,"Accurate, easy to read","I purchased this for our deck as we were very conscious of this summer's drought and wanted to get accurate measurements of rain on our garden.We are pleased with this guage. It arrived on time, properly packed. The guage was easy to hang as there are 2 screws in the package for that purpose.The guage markings are large and easy to read, down to the 10th of an inch. It is well worth the money."
3,"Easy to Read, But Short-Lived","Gave a clear reading from a distance, but after a couple of years, this plastic gauge has yellowed to the extent it is utterly unreadable, even up close. Cheap enough to replace, but I'll look for a glass one."
3,This Rain Gauge is Better than OK,"What can you say about a $5.00 object? Quickly stated, the pluses are: inexpensive, easy to read and install, it was one of the few that had a 5"" capacity (most only went up to 4"" and in South Florida we frequently get more rainfall than that), and it's one of the most low-tech tools I have, which is kind of fun. Negatives: I thought the back was made of metal, but it's plastic; the blue background is starting to fade after less than 2 months."
4,Will purchase my 3rd...,"Well, since I will be purchasing my third, I guess I like it. I just really need to remember to empty it if it is going to drop below freezing. They keep cracking. Guess I should just put it away during the winter. I really like how simple this product is, though. Guess that's why I'm buying another one."
4,Very easy to read from a distance!,"I know its hard to get excited about a rain gauge, but this one is really cool. As it fills with water, the water magnifies the reading. We can see the rain totals from our kitchen window onto our deck without going outside. My only gripe is, if its mounted with the screws instead of put into the ground, it's a bit of a pain to empty. By the way, screws are not included. Otherwise, the best gauge I've had."
5,My Husband loves it!,I purchased this item as a replacement for an old rain gauge that my husband had. He loves the lovely blue color and the magnification.
5,rain guage,Received quickly easy to read and also easy to put up. very pleased with purchase. Now waiting for it to rain PLEASE
4,Rain some more.,Got this for the wife for her birthday along with a weather station. This gauge does the job nicely as you can see it from quite a distance away.
2,resolution not good enough,"If you want this gauge for its price, great, its not that bad, but it's diameter is too small and its not graduated to 1/100th of an inch to allow you to keep daily weather records, and its not approved for use by any precipitation network due to these shortcomings. I would recommend, the standard cocorahs gauge if your interested in keeping climate records."
1,Disgusted,I purchased this item and in between moved to a new address. I emailed this suppleir several times before it shipped my new address. It was sent to the old address and returned. Thanks for the prompt response.
5,Clear Indication,"Works well with clear indication, especially when water is in the device magnifying the numbers. Not much to it other than that."
2,Just Buy Devil's Night,I think before Devil's Night was released they released this CD. The only reason to buy this is the video cut which you can watch on you computer. Other then that just buy Devil's Night.
3,Purple Plls,Sleller did great job on sending productCD is great but eather I forgot it was only 3 songs or I got the wrong cd because I didnt know this was considered a singleLove MM and D12 just dont like short CD'sAdam
4,no bad stories,"Though Silverberg/Haber, Duane, Athans, Braunbeck, and Baker float to the top, even Stackpole can't ruin this really interesting anthology of related SF stories. The setting isn't terribly unique, but the space opera cliches come off as more comforting than old hat. I'm not sure it makes me want to wade through the Diane Duane trilogy, but I'll be checking out more Star*Drive!"
2,Este cd no incluye versiones originales de estas canciones.,"Versiones a piano/voz de canciones grabadas originalmente por Alberto Cortez para los sellos disqueros Hispanovox, Pronto, etc."
5,Autolite Spark Plugs,I bought these for my '05 Mercury Mariner with the 3.0L V6 motor. Well packaged and arrived in good condition. Remember to check the gap and put anti seize on the threads before you install. Also remember to put dielectric grease on the COP lead from the coil before snapping the lead on the spark plug tip. Improved my gasoline mileage by about 3 mpg according to my dashboard mpg readout.
4,Mystical; good for doing yoga to,I have a copy of Zuzana's CD; There is a poetic rhythm to her voice and Joe Yamada's musical talent is evident in the soaring score that perfectly compliments her poetry. This is a great CD for yoga or other rhymic excercise. I wonder why... editors call these explicit lyrics? They're not racy; they're a woman's deepest feelings about life and love and the stars and the mystic.
4,A Good Set,"BoB was always a fav.Saw it when it first came out on TV and always wanted a copy.Getting it with ""The Pacific"" was a treat as I have not seen that.Would recommend this show to anyone who likes war movies.Never has a war movie been put together like this one."
1,more expensive,"this review is not against the series, they rock... its the price. The combo is more expensive than buying both blue ray editions separate."
5,Love,Can't go wrong with this huge set! Parents were very happy to get this gift and will have a great time watching it!
5,Great Set,"I bought this for my husband who really enjoys reading history and war books. He was excited when he opened this. If you have to get your nose out of a book every once in a while, these DVD's are really worth watching. We have both really enjoyed watching them together."
5,Great Set of DVDs,My son has wanted these movies for a while and when he found them at such a good price he requested them for Christmas. He has really enjoyed watching them. Great value for history buffs or anyone who is interested in military battles.
5,A great purchase!,This was easily one of my better purchases and most importantly an excellent production of War II! It was well packaged and no problems with viewing! A riveting production!
5,Amazing,"I've been wanting this for awhile and finally got it, the whole package is incredible from design of the case to the menus within the disc.. seriously great."
4,Shows are great,"The Shows, Band Of Brothers and The Pacific, are great! Got the set, used, from a store threw Amazon.com for my husband for fathersday. The quality said good, and it was. the box was torn and dusty, but the dvds inside were fine."
5,Beautiful set of dvd's and well pleased...,"Band of Brothers/The Pacific Special Edition Gift Set, is a beautiful set of dvd's that has been added to my sons collection, It was sent in very good time and packed sturdy to protect the dvd's. The dvd's are in a beautiful box with each dvd inside a heavy album type display with pictures and story line to follow. Amazon you have outdone your self with this item. We are very happy with it. Thank You so much. I am quite sure that if anyone else buys this item, they will be very happy with is like we are.."
5,Great gift,What a great set to give as a gift. My son requested these for Christmas and I was thrilled to find it as a boxed set.
5,Great Collector's Series,"This multiple miniseries set is a must have and looks great in the collector's series carrying case. I loved both of these miniseries when they aired on HBO and now I can watch them whenever I want along with commentary and bonus discs of the true life war heroes' interviews. Finally, a blu-ray set that gets it absoultely right.. What a Perfect gift!"
5,"Beautiful presentation with very well balanced information, definetly neither hype or negative.","Anyone interested in Panama, especially to relocate or to invest in property, should definetely consider get this DVD. It's non-bias approach, colorful scenery & up to the point information will help you get a better picture of what this country has to offer. It also provides with suggestions/do's & dont's on how to succeed there. Although not touristy oriented, it provides with some sightseeing of the main areas. At roughly one hour, it makes you ""crave"" for more. However it's well put together. Also it's in widescreen format, for awesome viewing on our flat screen TV. It's worth the money.Also recommend the following: ""Living in Panama"" by Sandra Snyder, ""Moon Handbooks Panama"", ""Culture Smart Panama"" & National Geographic's Adventure Map of Panama."
3,This SACD is Stereo Only not Multi-ch,While the music on this SACD is 5 Stars the SACD has only Stereo Channels and not Multi-ChannelsAmazon: Please find a way of marking SACD's on you web page
3,Entertaining blend of Celtic and Swedish traditional sounds,"Swp combines Celtic accordianist Karen Tweed and guitarist Ian Carr with Swedish fiddlers Ola Bäckström and Carina Normansson in a band that plays instrumental folk music from both traditions. Much Scandinavian traditional music is not that different from Celtic jigs and reels, so it's a happy blend. This album mixes traditional and original pieces, and it's not easy to tell which are which. There are only three songs with vocals. This is a pleasant, consistently entertaining album."
5,An interesting complement to the 1st CD,"I acquired the Mack and Mabel CD with Caroline in the cast 2 years ago. I was immediately smitten by the singer belting ""Time Heals Everything"". ... Two months ago, a friend suggested I listen to ""What I did For Love"". I instantly liked the 1st CD. And decided to acquire her second CD. Well, the collection is interesting. Similar with the 1st Cd, it is also diverse. However, what is unique with the CD is that it offers less drama and more FUN. ... Aquarius is very interesting. Perhaps and perhaps and What Kind of Fool have instant ""grab"". However for me, the most cherished songs are ""If You Love Me""; ""I Can Cook Too"", ""Big Spender"", and ""Kissing You. I do hope she would include in her upcoming recordings more Sondheim songs, and ""As if We Never Said Goodbye""."
5,A must!,"If I could give the CD 4 and a half stars I would, because What Kind of Fool and Dancing Queen need to be categorised into the ""what were you thinking?"" file. The rest is wonderful, bar People which pales in comparison to the original but a great version nonetheless.Mein Herr is amazing, easily the best track, Look What Happened to Mabel coming a very close second (I saw Caroline perform this song in Mack & Mabel and the standard was exactly the same, fantastic).In my opinion Caroline's best with the belters which is why those two songs and also Big Spender stand out, very saucy! This CD comes very highly recommended for anyone into musical theatre and such, Caroline is fabulous."
2,Just not much here,"I am in between a novice/intermediate user level in Pro E 20. I have a small background in plastics injection molding but mostly silicone molding. This book spends most of the time explaining basic injection molding design (things like draft, runners, core/cavity). But very the discussion of these features is very basic and mostely antedotal. You could learn just about everything covered in this book in about 1 hour talking with a mold designer and probably alot more with the mold designer. If you have been commissioned to start designing molds then you will need a hell of alot more then this book offers you. The final section of the book has work excercises designing parts. But it just tells you to design some parts on Pro E, NOT how to use Pro E to design the parts. I have done several tutorials that cover general features of Pro E but was looking for something that gave some new features in Pro E and HOW tos on those features. Not in this book."
1,It sucks,"Product too small to work, it stops after about 30 secods, cause the middle balls are not heavy enough and start swinging and dont transfer the impact energy as it should. Only works as a ornament."
1,do not buy,We ordered this and sent it back three times. They kept sending us broken product. Finally we just kept the broken product and threw it away.
2,not real deal,This item is for decoration only. The true Newtons Cradle should not stop. This one only goes for a minute or two then done. Nice for a decoration... or a child.
4,Good movie,"The film has several comic scenes from Anupam and Satish who got the best comic award. Direction by Subhash Ghai is decent Music is a highlight, MY NAME IS LAKHAN is very good and was a rage the Madhuri Number front of Jackie is the bestAmongst actors Anil is the highlight of the film and does a great job in his part, this role actually gave him immense fame, popularity and he balances th comedy and serious scenes perfectly Jackie is his usual serious self Madhuri is decent and , Paresh and Annu are good Raakhee is as usual Gulshan Grover hams in the role that gave him fame Raza Murad is okay"
5,perfect,From it's many behind the scenes features to the flawless live set spanning hits from all of their albums (except Sacrament) including Burn the Priest this DVD has it all. It's the perfect DVD if you are a lamb of god fan or just a modern metalhead. The part were they are stopped on the one way street in europe is unforgettable.
4,...Sick,"I picked this DVD up because in truth, I had nothing better to do. I liked Lamb of God's music, but was not a die-hard fan. Needless to say this DVD completely blew me away, and at times, I wondered if it was dubbed. Before too long, however, I realized that it was just great production--mabye a little too great. While it SOUNDS good, to some, the remastering takes away from the ""concert"" feel. The Dolby 5.1 makes up for some of this, but it's still not the same. All in all a great concert tho, a must have for all Lamb of God fans. They also include lots of extras and on the road footage, including some hidden easter eggs, of which I don't think I've found all of yet. The fight scene between Randy and their guitarist(cant remember his name, sorry!) is both priceless and scary at the same time. It's a real, raw look into the life of a musician and shouldn't be missed. Check it out!"
5,lamb of god is god!!!,this is one of the best music dvds i have purchased some of the behind the scenes stuff is very funny espeacily the outtakes very funny cause they where in england and they parked the wrong way on a one way street and thier was a guy and his girl in there car in front of them and they made up a storie what they where saying to each other in other words this dvd is hilariousBUY IT!!! BUY IT!!!! BUY IT!!!
5,Doesn't get any better than this!,"The B-Sides are definitely one of the best live shows, ever, so if you get a chance to see them, don't miss it. Even if you can't actually see them, this CD will make you feel good about the world. They're great musicians, and great songwriters. If you can listen to this CD without dancing, you're crazy."
2,"12"" speakers....","The reason i found that the speakers sound really heavy and boomy in the low end is directly due to the fact that they're 12"" speakers especially if the amplifier that's running them isn't of good quality. I have set up quite a few systems for people and have had nothing but bad reviews for 12"" woofers (subwoofers excluded) versus Excellent reviews for 10"" woofers. They seem to throw a punch like none other."
1,Not Worth the Money at ALL!,I have owned these speakers for a couple months and they sound awful for their price. The Bass is so terrible. If you put a KLH speaker next to it i would pick the KLH. I do not reccomend these speakers at all. Take my word for it.
5,particle and total?,"I am looking for a book from Heisenberg, called "" particle and total"" or something like that. however, I suspect this book is the same one. is anyone out there to know about this?"
5,It's an awsome Book!,"I am 13, I read this book last month. It is one of the best books I've yet read. I have a copy of it myself, and I also wonder what would have happend if Napoleon mmarried Desiree. Ii wish there was a second book, I recomend this book to all people."
3,Disappointed !,DJ QUIK is one of the best producers of the West Coast and showed it several times before on his previous album. This one was a big disppointment for me as I expected much more from him. Just 2 tracks on the whole album are good.
3,The last thing i wanted to hear from quik,"I have nothing but respect for quik and for his talent and skills. I don't know if it's just me or if this album is just wack. I really can't feel it at all and don't dig the beats or the rapping as much as i would like to. I had a feeling he was going in a different direction from how he was coming on his previous work, and thats exactly what he did. I felt so far away from his effort on this album that I only flicked through the album quickly twice since it came out and just left it in a pile of CDs. Hopes of another 'dollaz & sense' were smashed and I could confirm that I would depart from him. I really don't know what happened here, and it's sad. But anyway, If you are some new rap lover you would probably like this. If you are oldschool and know the good quik, I would say hear the clips first before you decide because you would probably not like it like me. Peace!"
1,BAD!!!!!,"I'm an old fan of QUIK and I think this album is a shame for the artist. Many beats are the same as ""balance and options"" and we can say that there's no creativity in this album."
3,3.5 Stars,Under Tha Influence is the best DJ Quik album I've ever listened to. This CD shows his improvement lyrically and shows versatility from his usual material. MUST HAVE!!!
4,David Blake changes up the game again.,"First off lets say that this is not a five star album from Quik. It is hit and miss in many places, but that is not to say that this highly anticipated release is at all throwaway. AMG lays down an infectious flow on Trouble. Quick bares his all in the track 50 ways where he pays tribute to his fallen friend Mausberg, who can be heard on 98's Rhythmalism or on his own album non fiction or the collab with Suga Free titled the Konnectid project. Again Quicks Groove never fails to satisfy, now in it's sixth appearance. For the very best quik album, check out Balance & Options, but this album will satisfy those who are looking for strong production in an album."
4,Death Row took a toll,"Well this has to be the only DJ Quik album that isn't 5/5 stars. The beats sound pushed and all the featured artists clash with Quik's weak beats on this album.SONGS WORTH MENTIONINGSex Crymee: 5/5 smooth classic quik beat. Very smoothCome 2nyte: 4/5 funky and funPut It On Me: Classic death row track. Dr Dre takes to much credit, Quik is the real west coast producer....even though he helped produce this.Ev'ryday: 5/5 hard bass and good rapping!Quiks groove 5/5 always smooth and melodic!One On 1: A chill track that features the 1 and only El Debarge!!!!!Oh Well/Out: 5/5 hidden tracks that prelude to TRAUMA! sweet"
3,Not Bad but not Much Growth,"I've dug quik's Music for Years but the last two Albums haven't knocked me out like His Best stuff.I liked how the Record started off with the Spinning&Mixing&I dig ""50 ways"" RIP Mausenberg.but after a while nothing changes the same 4/4 Tempo&Groove from the ""Safe&Sound"" Era is here again.the Humor doesn't Hold up near as long.not enough of Sugga Free either.Production is Tight but the Grooves just aren't that tough overall to me.some things work some guests work but overall I'm not really into it.Quik's Groove is the kind of Music that I wish Quik would Venture into More often.the only time He gets out of His Musical Trappings&is Free to Explore."
5,"A sweet, old-fashioned story encapsulating moral fables","While searching Kindle books for free old classic beekeeping manuals I came across this sweet little story that reminded me of the kindly grandparents I never knew.This is a very charmingly dated story of a pair of siblings sent to the grandparents' farm for the summer. They get into a few scrapes, and their grandmother reads them a moral fable every night that espouses old-fashioned moral values as basic as the Golden Rule. The serial nature of the book makes it a good 'nightly' read, chapter by chapter.I thoroughly enjoyed a visit to a more innocent time. This unsubtle, engaging but values-heavy type of content sadly will never make it into mainstream modern culture and is sorely missing from most children's entertainment. I plan to read this to my kid - an appropriate age range might be around 5-9."
1,very scary book,"I was given this book by my grandmother as a child. Nearly thirty years later, I still remember how very scary it was to me. It teaches life lessons with a heavy, heavy dose of guilt. In one story, a little boy does not do the chores his mother wants him to, and goes fishing instead. He comes home to find his mother has done all the chores, and IS NOW DEAD! In another, a little boy does not close the gate as he is asked to, and his little sister gets trampled by horses and is in a wheelchair for life as a result of his irresponsibility. Come on now! I found the book to be traumatizing."
3,Why...,I didn't really like the class that I associate with this book. I only skimmed it enough to complete the reading journal that I needed for the book. So it served its purpose.
2,Meager,"The book had some erroneous figures causing me to scrutinize the entirety of the information it contained. On top of this I felt it was poorly written with no closing to wrap up, typos, and instead of using a single form of currency when describing worth, Barnaby used several (e.g. Australian, the Euro, USD, Pounds, etc.) and I didn't like consulting a currency converter to make the numbers mean something to me. Overall, it was an informative but scatterbrained and, in my opinion, a useless book he wrote over the weekend to get some extra cash.By the way: who advertises with a review from the ""financial times""? Give me a break."
5,Stunning!,This book is everything I hoped it would be I love the cover and the dustjacket I especially the love the pictures from the movie Raintree County Elizabeth looked especially beautiful in this movie. The gorgeous costumes are great fun also. The movie Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf is not one of my favorite because it is not aesthetic I think Elizabeth was too young for this part although it stretched her acting abilities. I would have preferred to see her play herself/her own age at that time in her life It is difficult for us (her fans) to see her in an unglamourous role. But the book is fantastic.
4,Strongarm/weakarm,Strongarm is a bit smaller than i would have liked and he is not very articulate. he has a gun and a spare tire thingy that combine into an axe weapon. his gun alone is a grabbing claw and a boom arm all in one. I would not reccomend this to those whoget borred easily because it isn't the best toy on the shelves of anywhere.in all it is not the best toy hasbro has made.
3,"Decent dock, but overpriced like the rest of Apple's products","I have owned Apple iPod docks before and this one is basically the same but it only fits the 2nd Gen Nanos. It is somewhat difficult to remove the iPod from the dock because it locks in there pretty good. Its very small, about 1/3 the size of of the Universal Dock. I recommend this if you connect your Nano to a stereo system but if you just plan on using it for charinging or connecting to a computer then it is somewhat useless. I would actually recommend the Apple Universal iPod Dock over this one because it is only slightly more expensive and it can be used for every iPod model (with included dock adapters)."
3,"Good, but has a few flaws.","The iPod Dock is good, but has a few flaws. For example, I noticed that sometimes the iPod may not make contact with it, so you have to make sure it's pushed in all the way, but even then, sometimes you have to unplug it and try again. Also, you can't put an iPod on there if it has a skin and/or cover on it; you'd have to take it/them off in order to do so. Otherwise, it keeps the iPod standing up and charges it at the same time, so that's an upside."
2,Interfered with my cover,"I have an iPod nano 2nd generation, and this iPod dock sounded great because I knew it was compatible. I wanted to have a place on the computer desk to set it while it charged or loaded songs. The main selling point for me was that you don't have to reach behind the computer to plug it in. But I foolishly didn't consider that that was the case anyway with the cord that came with the iPod. The dock also interferes with my rubber cover that I have on my iPod. The only redeemable quality is that it has an audio out port to connect to external speakers. Other than that, I wasted my money."
2,"Graphic stickers peel off, don't waste your money unless you own a lot of glue",For each one of this series that I bought I was very disapointed to open the package and find that instantly the graphic stickers were peeling off the wood. It would have been great otherwise and if you want to take the time to glue all the pieces back down and have some kid friendly glue handy then at the sale price of @ $8 it might be worth it... for the retail selling price however you would be just crazy to buy this or any of the other Animal Adventures sets until they change their manufacturing practices.The figures are pretty nifty... no problem with them at all.
3,Fun reading with an intellectual tint.,"When Nietzsche Wept is a good book, a fun book - I am glad it had a postscript that explained the degree to which it coincided with history, because I was quite curious. What it didn't explain, and what I remain curious about, is how accurate the portrayal of Nietzsche's philosophical views might be. In any case, it is an enjoyable fictional walk through historic Vienna, in the company of a young Freud, a pre-syphillitically insane Nietzsche, seen through the lens of an self-tormented doctor.In short, an bit of gently intellectual light fiction."
2,other's self discoveries are not for everyone,"This may be a nice book to read if you are interested in the characters or in the process of psychoanalysis. There is not much left, though, if you are not strongly interested in the two of them, since the main line of the book is carried through conversations between Nietszche and Breuer. The end result is a lot of dialogue and a lack of reality, in the sense that the reader only gets to know their realities through the interpretations given by the two of them through their dialogues.I also would like to disagree with some of the other reviewers that said this is a deep and challenging book. Indeed, maybe it is for some readers and not for others, but a profound and deep book for me has more to do with the relation between the book and the reader than with the relation between the main characters as described by themselves."
2,Not Great Literature,We read this book for our book club. It made me appreciate the artistry that true writers infuse into their books.Yalom is a psychology professor -- not a novelist. His dialogue is extremely heavy handed and awkward.The book does have value to the extent it does make more accessible certain of N's ideas and the origins of psychology.But my advice is stay clear of this book.
1,"oh, please","As a practicing psychotherapist I was appalled by this book. The characters were one dimensional, the ""therapy"" demonstrated was simplistic, narcissitic and arrogant, and the writing just wasn't that good."
2,This Book has nothing to do with Friedrich Nietzsche,"Ok, now this is a good book in style but the fictitious representation of F. Nietzsche is totally rubbish. This can be considered as a good psychological book about life,weaknesses,loneliness etc..F. Nietzche was not your average human being at all so it is very unfair for Yalom to re-create another Nietzsche from his own mind.Its just a made up Nietzsche far too a weak and poor man that is irrevelant.The Nietzche in this novel is not what Nietzsche is all about so it's very very wrong to try putting him in just a fictional characters' shoes.As a matter of fact Yalom is a good psychotheraphist and he is not a bad writer.The book is allright in general if you only take the names out."
5,A great fiction setting for non-fiction characters,"The author builds a great setting for the characters to show what they are and what their thoughts are. If you search information on the characters, you'll see that Irvin D.Yalom has written this book as he interviewed them.The exect thoughts they fight for and the exect arguments they would be in if they were alive. As he says in the author's note at the end of the book, he has been to many confrences about Nietsche and Freud. These people has even never met but by the great setting, with an excellent topic he brings to a successful conclusion."
5,"Yet another captivating, must-read from Yalom!","I wanted so badly to believe all of the details in this story were true; Yalom described the characters with fantastic but not excessive detail, and allows the reader to get inside the head of each, and to varying extents. I can't get enough of Yalom. If you like to learn about therapy, read his books!"
4,Riveting reading,"Whether or not your a reader or fan of philosophy, you're going to enjoy Yalom's take on Nietsche from a psychological point of view, along with his assessment of Freud, Breuer and others lesser known of Nietsche's contemporaries. Although told as fiction, it's not a totally imaginative tale, as fact is intertwined with fantasy to create an intriguing story that marries philosophic thought with strong psychological analysis of both the ideals and the idealists."
5,One of the best novels of ideas that I have ever read,"When Nietzsche Wept is particularly moving and insightful novel of ideas. It will appeal to anyone interested in asking themselves questions about freedom, responsibility, and change in the format of a lively story, carefully imagined."
4,"OK, so Yalom is not a novelist.......","The fact that Yalom is a psychologist and not a novelist has become the most common criticism of this book. However, I found it very interesting. Few times are fact and fiction so carefully intertwined to produce a book that makes you think about your existence and how you dealt / deal / will deal with it after reading the book."
2,Very disappointed,"I was expecting much more from this book, based on the other reviews. It was very slow, both in plot and narrative technique, and didn't really entertain nor inform. I was very well acquainted both with Nietzsche and psychoanalysis prior to reading this and I honestly can say I didn't get anything out of the book. The dialogue and characterization seem overly simplistic and upon finishing, I felt like I wasted my time. I can only recommend this for anyone who has never really been introspective or given serious thought to any concepts such as free will, basically anyone who knows nothing about Nietzsche or existential philosophy."
5,Impressive,"For those who have read Hemann Hesse, you will find a lot of Harry Haller in this book. Humanizing Nietzsche is done greatly in concordance with ""Human, all too Human"", the explanations to some of the ideology behind Zaratustra that appear on the book, as well as an example of Psychotherapy that clearly demonstrate Yalom's capabilities as a writer and psychologist. This book is, however, best intended for those who have experience the solitude of both characters in the book. It is also recommended to do some research on psychology and read some Nietzsche so you can better exploit the great contents of the book."
3,Not as good as the Grateful album,"If you love the Grateful album like I do, this album will be somewhat of a disappointment. It is a collection of older songs that John Bucchino recorded in a home studio environment with some artificial backup - I don't think it is newly recorded as all of the songs are dated 1991. It is an interesting album with some hint of the talent that would come to fruition in Grateful. However, this album sounds like a demo album in comparison. Some of the soft rock songs could be done without."
2,Piece of a rubber hose will work the same.,"All my PCV valves that I purchased so far worked as valves, pass gasses on one side and stop them from the other side. This PCV valve seems to be different, blowing air from both sides of the PCV encounter no resistance."
1,I was ready to Purchase this...,"Until I read that a lot of the original Source material was cut.This is still a great deal. Especially with Disney Rewards Members $10 off,but still, I'd rather wait for an original cut."
1,No Dali!,"Boo - Give it to Disney to NOT release Destino, Salvador Dali's Disney project on DVD... No, you must be a BlueRay use to enjoy this feature. Boy, this is VERY misleading. I purchased this product ONLY for the Dali project because I am a high school art teacher. How many high schools do you know with BlueRay (as under-funded as we are)? NOT COOL DISNEY & AMAZON. The Dali text should not be in the description line of the DVD version."
1,"Sad,is'nt it?",Sad isnt it a film so historical in age yet cut to conform to todays STANDARD...do yourself a favor...DON>T buy it!
1,Don't encourage censorship,"The censoring of this movie is the real crime. There was no racism to speak of. The fact that it wasn't an all white cast at the time makes it better, but now it truly is an all white cast. I hate censors trying to tell us how to live. KEEP YOUR OPINIONS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE OPINIONS."
1,I almost buy it,"I have the same problem that the other fellow, i almost buy the movie, but reading the reviews i find out that the priceless treasure of animation from disney has been manipulated and now we can't enjoy the original motion picture, i think me and my kids are going to wait until a new realese and maybe we're lucky and we get the original."
1,"STILL CENSORED, STILL EDITED, STILL DUBBED","It doesn't matter how brilliant the film is, how much money Disney spends to restore it, how many ""Bonus features"" they include, the bottom line is this Disney has butchered and censored a masterpiece. NO EXCUSES"
5,Dubbed Voice of Deems Taylor?,"I am anxious to know if this new Disney Blu-Ray release has the same dubbing over of the voice of Deems Taylor, the narrator. Can anyone tell me if it does? When I bought the standard DVD a few years back and heared the dubbed voice I was appalled! The theatre version didn't dub him out and there is nothing wrong with his voice...so what gives? I am really hoping they didn't do this on the Blu-Ray. Thanks for the update if anybody knows the answer to this question."
5,Fantasia and 2000,Super fast shipping. Perfect quality! Brings back a lot of childhood memories watching this movie and first time seeing Fantasia 2000. Would definitely buy from again.
4,Great films but could have been better packaged,I thought that these were great and that they were wonderfully restored. I do feel slightly cheated at the fact that I spent money on four discs and the DVD's are simply copies of what is on the blu-ray. I would have preferred having more special features for each on the DVDs than have a copy of the same movie which are of no use to me as I already own a Blu-ray player. The sound and picture on the blu-ray discs are perfect though so this (in a way) almost makes up for it.
3,Not Destinoed to Be.,"I decided to upgrade my copies of Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 for this new combined release. Mostly, though, because I wanted to own and see ""Destino,"" having just visited the fantastic new Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, FL. I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet (without an HD TV), I don't see the point of upgrading just yet. I was sad to discover that the ""Destino"" short is JUST FOR BLU-RAY. What a bummer. Now it'll probably be quite awhile before I watch it. What an expensive short film this is turning out to be.Although a classic, I enjoyed Fantasia 2000 slightly more when I saw it in the theaters than the original. I guess it's probably because of the difference in animation processes. However, both films feel a bit slow-moving for today's fast-paced life."
2,"the stars are for the special features, not the movie","Both disc has a documentary, but the first Fantasia's doc isn't even about the film. The doc for Fantasia 2000 is a good making of about Musicana (the first proposed Fantasia sequel in the 70s).Then both disc feature the SAME ""feature/commercial"" of the Zac and Cody kids talking about the benefits of Blu-Ray; nothing to do with the film, how fantastic. I expected more. Disney is usually really good at special features. Heck, The Apple Dumpling Gang had more features and it's not even half as well known."
1,Censorship,"If all the studios got into the habit of censoring out ""poltically incorrect"" material, there would be no Our Gang comedy shorts at all. Put the movie in the original version in front of the MPAA and see what rating it gets and release it that way."
4,Fantasia/Fantasia 2000--love it!,"I had both of these versions of Fantasia in VCR. For that reason I was tickled pink to get them in DVD! I have always loved the first Fantasia, since I was a little girl. The only thing I was disappointed in was the fact that the music sound wasn't as I had hoped. The drums sounded like they originally did, boxy and muted. There is technology available now to improve the sound--to sound more like an actual live orchestra. I wish that had been done here. Otherwise, the color was better. Fantasia 2000 was too short and, with a repeat of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"", it was even shorter still. Nonetheless, both DVDs were still great to listen to. If you don't like Classical music, you may still be entertained by the coordination of animation with the music. Whether you have experienced both Fantasias before or not, you will find the music beautiful and exciting."
4,Happy to have this,"I really don't care that it's ""censored""...I give it 4 stars because I wish there was a special feature where you could skip over all the talking and just show the animations.I love this and am glad it's released in this pack so I can have both for my kid and future children to watch and enjoy. I loved Fantasia as a kid and now it's something I get to share with my little ones :)"
5,A+!,"As a kid, I always loved to watch these movies. Now, I have the chance to watch them on a great quality DVD. The package was shipped quickly and the product is in perfect condition. Couldn't have asked for a better purchase."
3,Fantasia 1940 on Blu Ray,"The visuals on this Blu Ray disc are outstanding. It is a disappointment however that the Deems Taylor comments are no longer available. It was also surprising that the original title of the 1940 Fantasia was not at the beginning. I am glad to have the original laserdisc release in which we hear the real Deems Taylor. In comparing the sound with the Blu Ray release, I have to say that the laserdisc release has much better stereo separation. I am very glad to have this new Blu Ray release as a supplement to the earlier release on laserdisc."
1,Blue Label Mixed with Water,"An incredible masterpiece ruined with non-sense modifications here and there. This is just like mixing a fine bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label with tap water... shameful results. Masterpieces must stay intact and well preserved, not modified!!! When you buy a ""restored"" piece of art you expect it to be true to the original. Think about making the Mona Lisa wear a nose ring by painting directly over it just so that she is ""updated""... totally ridiculous. Disney should learn from WB in how to handle people's judgment on presumed stereotypes or ideas of the past... Disney should inform people, and transfer knowledge instead."
5,Better than ever,"I first saw Fantasia in a neighborhood theater shortly after its first release. I then went to one of the ""special"" downtown (high priced) ones to enjoy it with a better sound system. I bought the vinyl ""HI-Fi"" disc when it was available and have enjoyed it countless times. When it be came available on VHS I bought it and was rewarded with the visuals again. It became one of our top 5 replayed favorites. I missed buying it on DVD and am oh so happy I did. Viewing and hearing it on HD TV (Blu-Ray) and hearing it through my excellent surround sound system is better than ever before. My thanks to the artists and engineers who first produced the programs but more to those who developed the technology enabling me to enjoy it now whenever I want (after supplying the rest of the family with earmuffs to attenuate the high volume necessary for me).Fantasia / Fantasia 2000 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)"
5,Great quality movie!,I bought this movie for my wife and daughter. Great quality! I could not find it in stores anywhere and was lucky to find it online. I was skeptical about purchasing it used but it worked out great.
5,Fantasia dvd,"Excellent! brand new never opened! Grand daughter loves it! (as I knew she would) raised my children with the original. excellent relaxing video for young minds, and a rest for parents and at the same time introducing their minds to classical music. If i could give a higher number than 5 i would."
2,No DESTINO included!!!!!!!! Incorrect description!!!!!!,"I purchased this item solely because the description states that Destino is included. IT IS NOT!!!! Disney switched at the last minute and included Musicana instead. If you want Destino, be forewarned. Oh, and Amazon still has not refunded me my money as they said they would."
1,When are they releasing Song of the South,"Let us all be thankful the morons at Disney won't have the chance to edit Gone With the Wind or any of a thousand other classic movies.I will buy this, if for no other reason to get the Dali short which is extraordinary (saw it at the Dali museum). But I will continue to hate Disney. No matter how PC this organization is today it was founded by a racist, anti semitic Nazi sympathizer, who at least respected the freedom of thought this nation gave him."
1,Boycott Disney's Orwellian Censorship,"I was planning to buy this until I learned that Disney was continuing to suppress the original version of the film in a shameless display of ""political correctness."" People who value film history have no choice but to boycott this insulting and degraded product."
1,Fantasia/Fantasia 2000,"The Blu Ray disc. does not play. Previews play. but I have tried twice, waited up to twelve minutes, movie never starts. There was a web site for Disney DVD'S. Which offered nothing, save telling me, perhaps my Blu Ray player needs a up date. Very dissapointed."
3,Age appropriate...Disney family viewing.,"I ordered this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter and thought I had remembered most of it from when I was growing up.Several parts were a bit questionable, like the females in the water scene that had no ""bra or covering"" on their chest. Whenit came to the demon or ""devil"" she got scared and ran out of the room, that's when I turned it off.I gave it to family friends that love it and are more age appropriate, in their late 20's. It is a collectable edition andthey are Disney buffs and into the classical music scene. Other then that, I enjoyed the graphics from that time era and theinovation of the musical material.I recommend this to an older audience of children that can tell the difference between right and wrong, good and evil and theinterpretation of ideas with music. We did something similar in my first year college Art & Design class with music and it isa good tool to learn something new using musical scores. It's a Disney worth watching again."
1,"No censorship, vaulting, or customer teasing","I do have the (legit) VHS versions of the Fantasias. They work. I would love to have the BD, but I have given up on Disney's tampering and degrading of product.I am sick and tired of Disney's teasing the customer by vaulting to force a rush on purchase. Now, I read that they add defects in the Fantasia disksto make it less desirable to copy these disks. Of course there is copy protect defeat software out there, but, let's face it, if the original productis defective, why buy it at all?I think it's a rotten trick to make us hold our breath so that we can rush out to buy it when it is released again.Well, I'm too old to wait or permit myself to be made anxious over this stuff, so I not only avoid buying Disney media releases, I also don't bother to attend theDisney movies.I have fond memories of watching Disney and the MM Club, but over the years, Disney has turned into just another greedy corporation."
1,edited,"instead of censoring, and hiding it, they should use it to explain racism of that time in a historical context instead of acting like it didn't exists. How about we censor the ""n"" word from Ricard Prior stand up. How about censoring Schindler's List and making it a family friendly film."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A GENUINE CLASSIC CARTOON BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A MUSICAL SYMPHONY WITH DIFFRENT CLIPS OF CARTOONS.
1,Fantasia is poor compared to the original without it's complete entirity,"I wish I had been able to take my original Famntasia & put it on a CD. It would mean more to me & show that the artist were very special & not being rude toward blacks or anything else. It was the times it was nothing like being racist.The Movie is what it is ""a classic"".I will find a way to be able to watch it in it's entirity.Disney People stand Up for your Products...."
1,Broken copy protection - avoid this,"My mother bought this and it refuses to run over HDMI on her Sony BR player. Sending it back, after I copy it with my software and remove the copy protection. Way to punish paying customers and forcing people to use piracy, Disney."
3,Website Hard to Pin Down,"When I begin to place the order, I can't find any place to click to say ""OK, I've finished choosing everything; I've given you my address; now, where's the place to click to tell you how I'm going to pay for it?"
1,ORIGINAL RELEASE OR BUTCHERED VERSION?,"I am very excited about this release!!!!! IF THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL RELEASE THEN IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY, DISNEY SHOULD LEAVE IN THE CONTROVERSIAL SEGMENTS!!!! IF THE ARE LEFT OUT I WILL BE HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED."
5,movie,I bought this movie for my grandson to watch. Anything with Mickey mouse in it he loves and sits and watches.
3,I think I expected too much,"I love Fantasia...the original that is. The original fantasia was so beautifully done. The music coresponded so well with the cartoons. The cartoons were beautiful. Fantasia 2000 is not like that. Don't get me wrong. The music is great, some of the cartoons are great. however, it just feels so RUSHED. Some of the cartoons just don't match up very well (IMO) to the music at all. Some of the cartoons even fee RUSHED for that matter. Given the choice I would not buy Fantasia 2000 over Fantasia the original."
2,It's the censored version,"It's really sad - now we finally have a home video format that can pretty much show us the same quality of 35mm film, so we get a copy of Fantasia - only censored.The black centaurs have been removed from the film to avoid causing racial offense. I can understand why Disney are antsy, but frankly, the drawings don't seem inherently offensive in their own right (they're actually respecteful compared to the ""blackface"" gags of some of the old Warner and MGM cartoons).Disney should look at how Warner handles content from an era where standards were different. They release their old material unedited and more importantly, they explain WHY it is being released unedited, rather than trying to hide it. Fantasia is hardly the best thing to come out of Disney, but it deserves better than this."
5,Visions for All,"Music, fantastic artwork and animation? It all comes together in this set of DVD's. The story is ageless and the music is the music of the ages! There is no better way to enjoy the ""True"" Disney world."
3,so much missed potential,"This is not about censorship, i don't really care about the black centaurettes.HOWEVER, seeing as Disney has employed a ""multiple versions"" gimmick for nearly every one of their ""platinum/diamond"" releases, my expectations were sky-high for this release. I was eagerly anticipating the option to watch the 1990 version with Deem's Taylors original voice, as well as the 1982 version with the Irwin Kostal Score.Why is it Disney will Insert a totally pointless and clashing song into ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", but not give us the historically signifigant alternate versions of Fantasia?If you do not have the original 2000 DVD release, by all means pick this up, but if you do, this really isn't worth it."
4,surprisingly good,"Amelia Edwards was a talented organiser,launching Egyptology for the general public in Great Britain.This novel proves that she also could write well.I found this book well-paced and compelling.The characters are believable and the settings clearly presented.This is a tale well-told,without resorting to 21st Century obsessions to reach the reader."
2,dispointed,Charactres aren't attractive. Story line is weak. It isn't anywhere close to the original episode.
5,After 20 years,"I saw the movie on the big screen today in the Bay Area. I must say, besides a few scenes of awkward/cheesy dialogues, the overall quality of the movie, including visual, sound, and plot line (which opens up to a whole new story arc) is top notch. Now I am not about to spoil anything to anyone. All I have to say is that, if you've got 20 dollars to spare, get this DVD, and it will bring you back to 20 years ago, when you first watched robotech on TV."
3,Robotech review,The story line was so so. Character plots were blah. Liked the animation. Overall it was a disappointment.
2,A little disappointed,"When I first heard about this movie 2 years ago, I couldn't wait to see it. I was a big Robotech fan when the show first came out in the 80's and also bought all the DVD's. Maybe it was the long wait for it to finally come out and all the hype from the website, but I was a bit disappointed with this movie. First of all, there was all this hype about Mark Hamill doing one of the voices. He has about 3 or 4 lines and is in the movie for all of one minute. Rick Hunter is barely in it as well, and Scott Bernard seems like more of an afterthought character who doesn't have much to do through most of the movie except look confused. The story was so so, and the CGI battle scenes, although nice and shinny, move stiffly and with the fluidity of a early 80's video game. I know I'll probably get a lot of flack from other fans but this movie didn't seem to show any of the heart that the original show had."
1,Not Robotech from a Robotech Fan,"I own about every Robotech collector's item out there. Shadow chronicles ain't robotech. The characters are drawn without robotech style from the original Japanese anime and slighly modified by Carl Macek. Tommy Yune doesn't anything about robotech nor do the artists from his korean buddy director and korean anime studio. I'm not collecting this, its not robotech. I wish they continue Robotech II - which was a decent series even though only a few episodes were made. This is a complete insult to robotech fans. A petition should be sent out by robotech fans to fire tommy yune and end this horrible series."
1,"Bad 3D, Big Disappointment","This movie is a big disappointment.The drawn scenes are well done and pleasant, but the 3D scenes are inappropriate, unrelated. With those 3D effects, the movie feels like a cheap computer game.I think 3D has no place in animation, except:-- as a hidden tool to help setup and draw the scenes,-- as an obvious tool to make a full-3D movie (as in Final Fantasy, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, ...).In any case, 3D or CGI is not needed.Watch ""Ninja Scrool"", an amazing animated movie. It has no 3D-CGI, and is better for it."
2,Macross this ain't,As a Macross fan I can only appreciate this series lightly.The animation is CGI and does not flow very well.The plot is a contiuation adaptation from the original Genesis Climber Mospeada series.Characters seem empty and one dimensional.The artwork is questionable not unless you like the giant proportions on the ladies.Any decent Macross fan will want to check out Macross Frontier instead.
3,Well endowed?,"Won't let down old-school Robotech fans. Well written annd executed, great acting with a most incredible score. My only gripe is I think the character design is a bit poor - I wish they had simply made them look like they do in the original show (Vince Grant looks particularly weird).They've also ""sexed up"" this new version of Robotech: every single female character has preposterously large breasts (even the Regis!) which are bursting out of their clothes. I simply find it, campy obscene and demeaning to Robotech and frankly just sort of embarrasing."
3,Where was Mark Hamill?,"I thought he'd have a bigger role but he's only in it as a bit character for less than five minutes. Overall, however, the plot adaption from the books was decently done, though the transitions can be weak and the character development is pretty much non-existent. For any one who hasnt ever read the books or isnt familiar with the new generation story this movie can be disappointing. Especially if your thinking that there will be the SDF with Rick Hunter and crew."
3,Fans,"Pelicula para los fans de la serie, sigue la misma linea de la serie, tiene poca aportación en cuanto a su temática. Con mejor animación que la serie sin ser muy exigente."
3,Missing key connections to the original series,"Nicely done, and had a good story line, but was msising some key connections back to the original series. If you haven't seen or don't remember where the original US series left off, then you may be watching this a few times to make all the right connections and get the most out of it. All in all, a nice movie to add to any Robotech collection."
1,20 Bucks wasted,"Don't bother buying this. As a fan since 1986 I was VERY disappointed in this so called movie. The computer generated graphics are an insult to the Robotech name. New people are introduced and no one bothers to explain who they are or how they got there. Scott acts like a wimp. Admiral Hunter has long white hair?!?! The Regis gives up and leaves out of ""kindness""?DON'T waste your money. This DVD is not worth it."
2,Mammoth Mammaries,"The character designs must've been done by the Japanese counterpart to Robert Crumb: the female characters in ""The Shadow Chronicles"" make Jessica Rabbit look like an Olympic gymnast. How ridiculously out of proportion? [...].Other than that...although it was nice to see Scott Bernard get rid of his cowlick and (briefly) ride a Cyclone once again, since everyone else from ""New Generation"" is forgotten, this cartoon feels forced and artificial. It's damn near impossible to encapsulate that same emotional impact that's earned over the course of eight hours and 25 episodes in a single 90 minute sitting. Why do you think a movie based on a soap opera has never been done before?[The exception to the rule being ""Serenity"" which worked because Joss Whedon is a frakking genius, and Summer Glau is hot.]If you're a fan of Robotech then by all means see this movie, but rent before you buy and beware of the cartoon women who can't see their shoes."
4,An Entertaining Portal into the Robotech Universe,"I really enjoyed this movie. I'm an anime fan, but not fanatic, so I'll spare you a 7 paragraph Robotech rant. I thought the plot was great and the story full with enough complexity to keep me interested. I liked it enough that I am going to find more Robotech to watch.I haven't seen any other Robotech episodes before this one and I was able to keep up with the story and not get lost. I didn't fully understand protoculture, but I don't think you need to, or should at this point. I could grasp the three waring parties and the hate between them. I was reminded of other classic Science Fiction stories including Star Trek which is a good thing. Characters had back stories which gave them depth.I liked the blending of the cgi into the classic anime. The voice talents are great as well. Poor voice acting can really ruin a story. The DVDs and packaging are top notch. It is a quality release."
2,Robotech-The Shadow Chronicles movie,I didn't care for it.It did not stick to vision of Jack McKinney.What I would like to see is a live action series version of the books and anime series.
3,"Nostalgic, but a letdown","Robotech was one of my favorite series as a kid. The Shadow Chronicles brings back memories of the old shows but there are glaring weaknesses that plague it, primarily relating to the animation. Simply put, the 3d animation is sub-par. The models have very little detail and are blocky. The 2d animation is ok but not up to todays standards. The dialogue and plot are ok and the extras are pretty worthwile. Hopefully future releases will not skimp so much on the animation."
2,Very disappointing,"Well, I was sort of excited to hear of a new episode of robotech. The graphics have been updated but that is all that can be said that is positive. The story line never gets going and there are some serious lag times with no action going on. Then the ending just abruptly comes up leaving you with the impression that it was not finished and just pushed out. I am a big robotech fan, and this was not a good continuation of the series. Half-baked at best."
2,Anime should by done by japanese studio,"I found the story interresting but that anime suffer from the studio that has done it. The anime style feel like and american anime, not a japanese anime. If that does not bother you, you can add a star. I still succeded to enjoy the story but not enough to watch it a second time. It take me half of the anime before suceeded to begin to enjoy it."
4,The saga continues!,"I just recently watched the entire Robotech series fairly recently and purchased ""The Shadow Chronicles"" to continue the saga. The Animation was beautiful, but I do have a problem with CG mecha blending in with the more traditional animation. 2 other issues I had with the movie was the wacky hair styles they gave some of the characters, and the fact that the changed the ending a little in the orginal series to fit the current story. Things I truly enjoyed about the series would be the animation. I also enjoyed the fact that the brought in the original voice actors to replay their roles. Its great to see characters from all 3 generation of Robotec togethor in 1 movie. I Also enjoyed the cliffhanger ending because it means more robotec in the future and thats something I can never get enough of! Overall enjoy the movie, this fan did."
3,Nice 2 disc set of an updated animated interstellar action fest,Being a neophyte to the Robotech universe I enjoyed the movie on this DVD more than I probably should have knowing very little about the characters and narrative. The english voice acting is well above your average anime fair and once it gets cooking the action is nonstop. The animation and CG mix is a bit unsettling visually looking like it wants to be 2 different styles. There is a semblance of plot that I am sure means alot more to the fans than us newcomers but the storyline will probably be expanded upon further down the road so if you like it you can backtrack. A good time for animation fans who appreciate good voice work (but hokey dialogue) the cosmic camradre on display here is infectious and I enjoyed the action scenes alot however as a fan of animation more on a whole I found many of the extras on disc 2 more engaging than the feature ultimately.Great packaging and extras all animation titles should get this treatment.
4,Great - close to the book,"I am a fan and I have the original Robotech series as well so I was cautious about this. However, this is a nice visual movie and the story is pretty similar to the book. I enjoyed it."
4,Not Perfect but Perfectly Enjoyable,"I've read the mixed reviews and find myself confused. I thought the Shadow Chronicles was not only entertaining and worth the price, but it opened the door to a continuing saga that I once thought was dead. Robotech was my favorite show growing up. I was a member of the RDF fan club and sought after anything and everything Robotech. The movie brought back the nostalgia and was reinvigorating. The characters are introduced well, the writing is easy to follow, and the animation is superb. Flaws....yes. But I have no complaints except that I want more. More animated features...a new series...a rendition of the Sentinels novels/comic adaptations...yes. A live action drama....sure (a la Battlestar Galactica). This is a must buy for anyone hoping to see more Robotech."
1,Awful...,"I have been a ROBOTECH fan since its inception in the 1980's. I loved the series and the spinoff movie in which Lisa and Rick get married.ROBOTECH the Shadow Chronicles was bad.Bad storyline (it leaves you hanging),Bad acting (CHEESY Dialogue),Bad animation (I love Japanese animation not Korean animation).I not only watsed my money but my time watching this movie. You'd think after 20 years Harmony Gold could produce something to knock your socks off, this movie didn't even leave a wrinkle in my socks. VREY DISAPPOINTING!"
4,Loved it,"I have never been an anime fan, and the only thing that piqued by interest was Dragonball Z. But that said, I enjoyed this movie. The writers do a good enough job of filling in new viewers on what has gone on.The characters are written very strongly and so is the plot. Usually animated movies have a tendency to go off tangent but for this movie the plot was very cohesive.And fianlly, the animation. I have not see older Robotech cartoons so I can't them as a basis of standard. However, in comparison with other anime shows, i.e. Naruto, Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo, the Robotech Shadow Chronicles was much better animated."
3,A good idea....,"While bringing back a classic tale like Robotech is a good idea, R:TSC only scratches the surface of what could have been an outstanding storyline while hacking apart the novelizations of the Sentinel series in order to tell the story. I would have been happier if they focused more on the end of the Sentinel War than the end of the Next Generation, and tied up the loose ends as told in the novel ""The End of the Circle""."
1,gawbawge,"this movie is a total disappointment. with comments such as ""full motion picture"" and ""cg"" effects, it makes you wanna believe that possibly they got something worth viewing. sadly, that is not the case. the art is lousy, the dialogue is childish, the battles are LAME and the story line is chopped. i am an avid robotech/macross fan and i have even read the books, including the entire sentinels series AND ""end of the circle"" (i think that is was it's called). the books were simply great, but the adaptation to ""movies"" literally sucks hairy balls. for those of you who would love to know what happened after the expeditionary force left earth with rick hunter, i would advise you to spend your money on the books and totally skip on this movie (and the sentinels movie). i sure hope that the clowns who came up with this movie do not have any say in the [hopefully] upcoming real live action movie."
1,The FInal Verdict,"For OJ to be guilty, you must believe that he quickly disposed of the bloody clothes, shoes, and knives so they would NEVER be found, yet brought the socks and glove back to his home! And then smeared blood all over the console!The coroner who did the autopsies testified ""the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM"". The limousine driver testified he brought OJ to the airport at that time. When you read this book, note how they avoid discussing these facts."
5,"Gripping, heart-breaking, facination","This book will put you directly in the midst of the Goldman trauma. A perspective of the victim like this should be the basis for every criminal trial in America that is dealing with the loss of human life. While I read this book, I felt as close to being victimized by this tragedy, yet knowing I really wasn't. The Goldman's are incredibly strong people-they can endure anything after going through this.The account of the civil trial was awesome. Dan Petrocelli was truly amazing and was able to prove every point without a doubt. I felt like I was sitting right there in the court room. And the victim impacts statements at the end of the book were unbelievably dramatic, they should have been able to say them in open court. Everyone who wants to know the impact of domectic violence and crime in Americal should read this book. This book is truly a tribute to Ron"
5,It will touch you to your very soul.,"I have read many books on the O.J. Simpson debacle. This book rings the truest of them all. Ron Goldman was a very special person and truly loved by his family and those who knew him. I am sorry that I wasn't one of them, for I would have truly been blessed. This book is written by his family and they let you into their world with such candor that it leaves you breathless and heartsick at times. I found myself so wrapped up in it that when I was through it was as if I was leaving an important part of my life behind. All I can say is that with the passing of Ron Goldman from our own nasty little world, heaven became a better place. To the Goldman's....if you read this please know my thoughts and prayers are with you and you and Ron have truly touched my life. He may be gone from this world, but he will live on in my heart forever. God bless you."
4,Heart-wrenching book,"This book brought into focus the young man that was ""lost"" in all the media attention on OJ and Nichole. Poor Nichole was doomed and would have been killed regardless but Ron was in the wrong place at the wrong time and paid for it with his life. Until this book came along, I didn't know much about Ron Goldman and was glad to finally learn about who he was. It also gave an entirely different perspective on the trial."
5,Beautiful Pictures,"Beautiful pictures make this book a delight to read. It has pictures of many different types of Orchids and easy ways to care for these lovley plants. Step by step instructions help the new Orchid lover care for their plants. Helpful information on care, feeding , watering ,repoting and more. Great book and a must have for any Orchid lover."
2,Information From Photos: poor,"Summary: With the thousands of books about orchids, look a little further until you find a better book than this.This book is designed for the person who doesn't know much about orchids, but wants to learn. Photographs are included with the intention of conveying information - but the quality of the paper, or the printing process, results in almost adequate resolution. Meridth Publishing must think photographic quality isn't important for this type of book, because it isn't designed to be photography book, but with low quality images, one can't distinguish that flowers shown are orchids, let alone be able to compare the images to gain a better understanding of the types of orchids - which is exactly part of the theoretical content of this book.The person new to orchids will want to know how to pronounce the new vocabulary. Very limited information is provided in this area."
4,Great guide for the beginner orchid hobbyist,"Ortho's ""All about orchids"" is a very good general guide for the beginner orchidist who wants to have a single reference book for information on topics ranging from potting materials to diseases, from understanding and adjusting environmental factors to fertilizer use. In addition to this general information, the reader finds information on each of the orchid alliances, with one or two pages for each popular orchid species and hybrids, including pictures, description, cultural information and heritage, and ""tips for success"". I find myself going back to this book all the time - and not just for the beautiful pictures. I recommend this to anyone who has a passion for orchids, and is looking for ""how to"" information."
5,Excellent,"This is a truly excellent starter and it's great for the medium level amatuer, too. There is a lot of information, yet it's not succint. The quality of the pictures is not satisfactory, however, this is one of the very few books which show overall plants, as opposed to show macro of flowers only. This is not a minor point: when I placed my first order online, I decided I was not going to buy dendrobium, because I don't like the plant. While this reflect my personal taste, knowng how the overall plants look like was a major plus. Moreover this book teaches how to measure the light intensity by simply using the lightmeter of your TTL camera. To me this information alone is worth the price of admission."
2,Only worked for a few days,"While my 5 year old really wanted a spy watch, he only wore this for a few days. The motion detetector didn't really work as advertized, but more importantly, the digital display stopped working after a few days. The led light continued to work, and the telescope thing worked ok, but the actual watch acted as if the batteries were dying."
1,Thank Goodness I got it on Sale,"Thank goodness I got it on sale. It never worked properly, was a pain to try and figure out. The motion detector never worked properly and was constantly going off at all hours of the nite. I'd return it,but it would cost more in S&H than the watch did originally."
4,Better without the singers,"Hoven Droven is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. They play folk music with attitude, engaging a bunch of non-folk instruments like Saxophone, and add a up-tempo beat. Very nice, very original.However, this is the first time I'm hearing Hoven Droven with the addition of vocals, and I have to say, I'm not a fan of that. The instrumental tracks are excellent, the ones with the singers are not so good. The singers themselves are OK; nothing to write home about but nothing great either. The magic of this band lies in the musicianship, and they should let that shine through instead of supplanting it unnecessarily."
5,Fantastic hard rock reels,"This is the only Hoven Droven album I've got so far, and man is it fantastic. Very heavy rock ""reels"" with a unique sound, and a few songs with some lovely sounding female Swedish singers. The album rocks. Kind of like you took a heavy metal band to a Renaissance festival. I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,Nice to have an OOP book,"It's nice to find an out of print book at a reasonable price but if it's in really used condition, it should NOT be described as like new. This was described as like new but both covers were creased and the book had seen lots and lots of wear. It really should have been described as ""In used condition."""
2,Confusing and not for a real golf fan,"I rented this game before I bought it and I'm glad that I did. My husband and I are both golfers and love the Wii Golf game that comes with the system. So we thought this would be fun too.....NOPEIt is really confusing, especially if you are used to the Wii Sports Game. And we had a hard time getting anything to load correctly. Finally we gave up becuase it just didn't make much sense to us."
1,THIS GAME JUST SUCKS,"I do not like this game at all. The difficulty is ridiculous, and the options are very limited. There are plenty of extras, but accessing them is tedious and VERY frustrating. The computer's skills are far too perfect, making the competition incredibly skewed, especially for those who are just getting used to the Wii controls. The banter is annoying, and the characters are forgetful. Wait for something better. DON'T waste your money."
1,Stupid Game and a waste of money....,"The free golf game that came with the system was a blast and so I thought I'd try this game. This game wouldn't be worth my time if it were free. It is a waste of time, has nothing to do with the real game of golf, isn't fun, and doesn't work well.This thing should not be for sale, never mind $50. Avoid this garbage game at all cost."
3,Okay,"This game is okay, but nothing special. I believe they could have worked on the interface a bit more. Clicking on the screen and then swinging the remote everytime gets to a person after a while. And, the characters could have been a bit more original. Oh and when I started to see scrolling text I was set back a bit... I really expected to hear the characters speaking. I thought voice overs had become common in sports games...?Well now that my rant is over there are some good points to the game. For one, the game is a bit more real then wii golf when it comes to wind. The wind is not constantly what you see before you hit it. If you're behind a tree it might show little or no wind because the tree is blocking it, but once the ball is hit into the open the wind will still have a affect on the ball."
2,"Its golf, but not the fun kind","I'm am not a golfer, however, my family and I LOVE the golf mini-game in Wii Sports. So to get a greater fix I purchased this game. Unfortunately this game is not nearly as fun as the Wii Sports version.Aside from the lame story (which I can forgive), the control scheme feels very much like they slapped the Wiimotes abilities on top of a ""button masher"". For example, in Wii Sports Golf the power of your swing is determined by the force of your swing, in SSG you sloooooowly rock your arm back and press a button to ""set"" the power. This takes a HUGE element of fun out of the game in my opinion. This game might be fun on a traditional console but a Wii game it is not.I plan on trading this one in, save your money for a future golf game that more closely mimics Wii Sports natural flow."
1,Super Swing Golf,were hoping for play on real golf courses with good graphics like the old super nintendo golf games have. the golf that came with our Wii sports package is much better than this - we were very disappointed and wish we could get a refund.
2,Generic Anime meets underfeatured Golf,"As a multiplayer game it beats Wii Sports Golf, that's the nicest thing I can say. TECMO missed a great opportunity here to merge ""real"" golf aspects with all the fun obstacles of Mini-Golf in a fantasy 3D environment that would never be possible in the real world. From the demo videos that's what Super Swing Golf appears to be, but it's not. It's a generic golf game that uses generic anime characters and a rough story line to try and bring golf to the Wii.Unless you just really love Wii Sports Golf and want something a little better, pass on this until it hits the bargain rack. It's just not an A list kind of game."
2,Way Too Difficult,I just rented this game to test it out. My kids and I have been taking turns for hours and we can't get past the second opponent. It gets boring playing Uncle Bob over and over on the same course. I guess there are a lot of neat courses and characters but we can't unlock any of them. I also have a hard time with the controls and sometimes its confusing.This wouldbe a fun game if it weren't so difficult to play.
5,Handy.,Allows you to connect your 1 Lb. throwaway cylinder camp stove to a bulk cylinder. I also purchased a short extension hose to make this even easier. It makes other campers jealous when they realize that I will never run out of propane!!!
1,NO technical data at all,This book is terrible. It is one big office 2000 advertisement. It only brags about the features of office and not how to implement them on my systems. It is very easy to locate the sections I am interested in but there is no detail or technical information.
2,Resource Kit ? I don't think so...,"Unlike previous MSPress Books entitled ""Resource Kit"", this book fails to follow suit in a big way. A more appropriate title would be ""Microsoft Office 2000 Roll Out Kit"". The book contains nearly zero information on how to deal with ""situations"". On the other hand, the book should have 5 stars if used as a Roll Out tool. If you are looking for tech support, find another selection. If you must force feed an install to the enterprise user base, then this is the place to start."
2,"Seeking Quick solutions, GO AWAY..","This book offers some good information and especially, if you are a power user or an administrater. But, if u need quick solutions or like to seek answer for specific problems...this book would be as good as OFFICE HELP (may be with few exceptions, really few)!"
4,Good Tool If You Already Know Most Of The Answers,"This is a good tool to have around. It's definitely not light reading. If you already know a good deal about the topic you are interested in, this book helps clarify the individual information.I use it as a resource when I am working on problems. In that way, it is more of a reference book for me.If you support Office 2000, this should be part of your library."
1,Nearly 100% useless,"There is absolutely no coherent outline of how to use this product in this book. One is reminded over and over about all the wonderful advantages of using the Resource Kit, but there is no explanation!"
3,Critical Chain,"I enjoyed his book ""The Goal"". This book takes too long to get to the point. I don't think it is as well written as the former. I believe the content is very good, but maybe I should have waited for the Reader's Digest version. I like a book that is fast paced."
3,Literature it ain't. But it might just mean better projects,"Easier to put down than The Goal or It's Not Luck. But for those, like me, that are in neither manufacturing nor marketing, it provides useful applications of TOC for project management. I wish Goldratt would summarize the principles of his ""novels"" in an appendix. Often I wish to refer back to the key principles that could be summarized in 5-10 pages, but instead I must pour through weak dialogue to pull them out for revew."
2,Should have quit while he was ahead,"This book is as painful to read as The Goal is delightful. As the old saying goes, ""If you've got a good thing, you might as well beat it into the ground."" Can we consider a critical path in a project similar to a bottleneck? Sure; now let's move on to bigger and better things.The writing is third rate and the application isn't enough of an extension of The Goal to lead the reader through the number of pages offered. Between thumbing his nose at academics, big business and anyone else he's been slighted by, Goldratt forgets that his primary mission is to let the reader in on his secrets of project management. If you can't check it out from your public library, then you're better off not bothering with it."
3,"Speed read, and got results in less than 1-hour","Browsing through the bookstore, I skimmed the first half of the book (standing up). Although I don't consider myself an impatient new yorker, I found myself jump towards the end (leaning against the wall). I found very useful the TOC approach with imbedded real world applicability. I laughed realizing someone actually put in print what actually occurs in project management - DELAYS - real and virtual. I enjoyed the unveiling and realigning the critical path based on the critical chain. Although I am not a fan of novel reading, it was good and deserves applause. It would be easier to reference key concepts/ideas using bullet points. I found I got the point just reading the latter half. For the global company I represent, I found the concepts valuable for our Program Managers worldwide."
4,"Good, but not as good as The Goal","TOC is OK for simple operations that are run by really stupid managers, but fails to offer a lot of assistance for real world problems in a moderately complex organization. I think the book High-Mix Low Volume Manufactring by Mahoney does a much better, if much more boring, job of explaining the complex decision making process that is really needed. For example, it is rare that operations or logistics knows the status of jobs, or the operators, or the equipment, or the material, as well as is needed to take full advantage of any of the techniques, even in a fairly small plant. This results in information ""noise"". Add to this variable delay time, and the combination acts to reduce the effectiveness of any control system: this is basic feedback theory. TOC works well in stable (low mix) environments, but may not lead to the most efficient operation in other settings."
3,Quite readable for an educational book,"I got this book for my ""excellent work"". Initially I thought it was going to be boring, but it turned out it is reasonably well written and interesting. However, at times it is too slow and makes you realise why there are all these management summaries out there. The concept of ""critical chain"" itself is quite useful, if implemented properly. However, I don't think many companies will be able to do this, because of the temptation to remove the buffer time after the new estimates are made, and the fact that people will know this in advance, and still secretly add buffer time of their own to the individual steps. This is what happened where I worked, anyway."
2,Difficult to comprehend,"I've been familiar with CPM for twenty years, but haven't heard of many of the terms used (e.g. feeding buffers, chains, etc.). It's too philisophical for me. Today, in this labor market the skilled worker is highly paid and in short supply and they know it. The only effective management tool that I find now is to stay close to the work and 'pull' the parties along. It makes more work for me, but it's the only way to half-way maintain a schedule and keep a handle on quality. I believe this book would interest those loftier managers who are far removed from the trenches."
2,"Good concepts, lousy novel","The Critical Chain is the first ""business novel"" I've read although I've read a lot of business books and a lot of novels. I like the ""business"" part of this book (applying Theory of Constraints to project scheduling) a lot more than the ""novel"" part. I thought his female characters were shallow and stereotypical. Like others in this thread, I wish that the key concepts were summarized in an appendix. Nonetheless, the application of TOC to project scheduling is interesting and useful."
2,Reading in progress,"The ideas and concepts in this book are repeatitive of those in Goldratt's other books (The Goal etc.) If it were not for fulfilling school requirements, I wouldn't have spent money and time on this book."
5,goldratt is goldratt,love the way he composes it. the points he mentions are all interesting. i did not learn it from class.
3,If you like learning from novels,"A ""made-for-TV"" novel with a lesson about a new method of project scheduling. Goldratt invented the ""Theory of Constraints,"" a general problem analyis and planning method which he then applies to various areas. Each application presented in story format.""Critical Chain"" = ""Critical Path"" x ""Theory of Constraints"".Read this book if you want an easy read and a fun introduction to the subject. But if you actually want to apply the Critical Chain method, you'll probably need a textbook format. Or make the effort to abstract the method from the dialogue of the story."
3,"Easy to read, nothing really new.","This book teaches some concepts regarding project management that any experienced project manager already knows. Experienced project managers know to pay attention to all the critical dependencies in the project, not only the critical path. Cutting all estimates in half and adding one third at the end of the path as a buffer sounds like a good idea in principle. However, it easily falls apart in reality when you realize that most of the projects fall under the other end of the spectrum by being too optimistic. It is important to mention that by writing this book in a novel format, the author does not have to be as thorough as in a non-fiction business book. This is just a novel and should be treated as such. As for the ""new"" concepts, you will be better off by practicing the basics. Get the PMBOK from the Project Management Institute, read it, apply it, and your projects will benefit a lot more."
4,Very insiteful for Prject Planning.,I felt the book was written very well. I was left wanting more of an explination of the other areas in which TOC can be used. Such as the example at the end of the book where TOC is used in the accounting world.
4,Good Yeast,This is good yeast. I bought a four lb pack and I'm on my third pound now. It's never failed to work. It is NOT compressed yeast as another reviewer claimed. It's normal yeast just like you'd buy in the little packets from the grocery store. It is an instant yeast so there's no need to proof before you combine with other ingredients. One complaint is that the yeast is a little old - the batch I got expired about 13 months after purchase.
5,The Last Classic in Cybernetics,"A great encyclopaedia in Cybernetics and Systemics. Comparing with 1997 edition, the second edition (2004) is more complete and better elaborated. Unfortunatelly the Cybernetics and Systems Theory Encyclopaedia Project does not survived and the website is now quite abandoned. A new and modernized third edition of the Encyclopaedia of Charles Franois is now necessary. It's a classic for who loves or researches on the theme."
3,a disappointing CD,"After owning Edwin Fisher with Furtwangler and Horowitz with Reiner's Piano Concerto No.5 by Beethoven, I decided to buy a stereo version with better recording. One night, I tried Brendel with Haitink's recording at Barnes and Noble local store. That was a Philip Bargain price CD and was fantastic, although there were only a few bars for available for listening. It is heart-breakingly moving at the beginning of the second movement.But after I got this CD, I find Brendel disappointing this time. It is hard to say why, but simply not an outstanding recording."
3,"Works fine, but overpriced for a 6"" ""jumper cable""","Works fine, but $12 for a 6"" adapter cable is kind of steep. Note that when using this adapter, you will need to power the ""antenna turn-on"" cable on your aftermarket wiring harness (the blue/white cable) since the Legacy/Outbacks have a powered antenna amplifier mounted in the rear of the car."
5,Just A Grand Film Score,"Not what you would call great film, King Kong Lives is a mess. Poor script bad production values...but it does have John Scotts score and its a winner. Vibrant and emotional this music soars way above the film its attached to. This is one of Scotts best and is a favorite of mine along with Final Countdown,and his score for the made for television 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Long after you've forgotten the poorly made film you will remember this music. It is absolutely remarkable."
5,GIVE US MORE AQUA AQUA!,"This is a great game on the verge of distinction.Super choice for family fun. Puzzle format. Multiple player.Problem solving strategies, decent educational value and so fun! Simple. Action/violence junkies need not apply. Age 5-105"
3,Wet puzzle action,"The concept for this game is unique to Playstation. You have to build lakes and get your land to hold water until you evaporate it with fireballs to score points. I agree with most of the other posters in that the overshoot/undershoot thing is hard to get used to, and that the fixed camera angle is an issue, however the Zoom feature is helpful. Worth a rental to decide if you're going to buy it."
1,Umm...,Wtf!? That what you will say when you turn this game on. You can rip out your insides of your ps3 (who wouldn't want to at this time eh?) you will understand how the insides of the ps3 work before you will this game. Not really puzzles. Kinda like being brainwashed
5,sonorous synth,"This album is somewhat melancholy- like someone nearing the end of a long romance, but at peace with himself and gaining a perspective on the world. ""Where is my Mind?"" is an awe inspiring, spacy synth version of the Pixies' classic. The others are wonderful synth songs like those you can listen to on their later release, Monogamy [...].House of Wires distill the smooth, high production values of great New Wave bands and adds maturity, sophistication, and lots of sounds I've never heard out of a synthesizer before. The vocalist has a pleasing, sonorous voice; the music is all wonderfully listenable and enjoyable without being boring. I bore easily so I listen to mostly alternative styles of music; there is nothing better than finding an artist that does very new things in a truly listenable and enjoyable way."
4,Sensible and Useful,"I was given this book when I began my work as a museum interpreter ten years ago. It gives a comprehensive overview of the field. There is information on both how museums have changed and present trends. Theoretical insights about learning theory are developed into realistic applications for planning activities on the museum floor. Part Two on the interpretive process would be improved by some discussion of first person interpretation, a dynamic new way to bring history alive at house museums, outdoor sites, and more traditional history museums. Also, there's room for more discussion of the problems and pitfalls which today's visitors can offer. But I found this book so helpful that I plan to use it in training 150 volunteers and a dozen paid staff at a new museum opening in January, 2001."
5,la grande dame of Romanian song,"Maria Tanase remains unique. She is both authentic and stylish,with deep knowledge of Romanian authentic folklore (yes, I remember the wax cylinders recordings from the country side). Her impeccable regional language subtleties, her perfect French accent and ennunciation are characteristic of her amazing talent, hard work and artistry. She is passionate, in control and has a great sense of humor when singing about love, wine, handsome men and beautiful women. More CD's from her old Electrecord LP's please!"
3,nice,"This instructional figure painting book is nice but not outstanding. Much of the book focuses on analyzing work by great artists, to demonstrate techniques. There are also several step-by-step demonstrations. This book is best suited to artists who (unlike me) enjoy learning from examining other artists work."
1,Only lasted two seasons,"Like other have reported, my unit worked great when new but steadily degraded over time with more frequent 'freezing'. This also happened with my 605 so it seems to be a general problem."
1,Product does not work.,"By removing the product from the box and follow the recommendations of the instruction manual, I realized that the device did not care and also did not carry the battery, or does not work. And until this day did not work.So I can not include an review of the product."
3,Edge 305 review,Works well but has several shortcomings. It is difficult to read due to small font and also difficult to see whether the HR and cadence monitors are connected and functioning. Battery doesnt last very long and almost ran out on a century ride ( 6 hrs). logistics of getting to ride information is inferior as there is no separate button like the 705 has.Good value for the money however.
3,Okay,"Short battery life.Hard to read display.Display not well organized.Good, but room for improvement."
2,computer brain blew it,Computer Brain sent the wrong product right before Xmas so the present that I intended had to be shipped back and it is Jan. 16 and I am still awaiting the right one. So I don't even know what the product is actually like yet.
2,Eldredge can apparently make any subject boring.,"I have read many books on various aspects of science. This is as boring as any I have ever encountered, even though the subject matter should lend itself to a very interesting treatment.A blurb on the back cover claims that ""Niles Eldredge knows how to make science exciting."" I can only wonder why, if he knows how, he doesn't do it. I would guess that he just does not put as much concentration and effort into his writing as he odoes into his research. That is all well and good, but I do not think the result is worth expending either time or money on.BTW, I have no reason to be predisposed to dislike this book, i.e. I am not a creationist, etc."
2,Outdated & Simplistic,"This book was a major disappointment. With Eldredge's credentials, I expected some fresh insights into fossil arguments and punctuated equillibria vis-a-vis the origins debate. Instead this volume is largely a minor league treatment, rehashing outdated and simplistic arguments.The fact that serious criticisms are being aimed at darwinism from scientists with many different philosophical backgrounds is glossed over and the reader is instead treated to a clichéd dismissal of religious fundamentalists. The same tired specimens, like Archaeopteryx, are trotted out yet again. Worst of all, the author belabors old arguments advanced by the late Luther Sunderland, while largely ignoring the fresh critiques of evolution from the likes of Johnson, Dembski, Behe, ReMine, Cuozzo, Gitt, Denton, etc.Despite both being somewhat dated, one still will find a better anti-creationist case made by Strahler and Kitcher."
1,Offense without defense - disappointing,"By focusing his emotional attack on the vast-right-wing-conspiracy of creationists et al Eldridge fails to defend evolution on its weakest flanks. As a mathematician and scientist, I was hoping that he could give an answer to the apparently devastating probabilistic attacks on Neo-Darwinian evolution. (E.g. probability of the genome forming 2 billion base pairs in the estimated life of the earth and so on.) By making the book a distributed ad hominem attack on the creationists he fails to address the concerns of scientists like me that are not creationists but are starting to wonder if evolution is just more political junk science..."
1,Disappointing read,"As a PhD scientist I keep hoping for someone to write the book that will answer the critics of evolution as the explanation for new species. (There is no debate about simple viruses or sub-species such as dog breeds.) Instead we have people like Eldredge foaming at the mouth about the irrational religious rednecks that cannot see the obvious truth of Darwin's theory. It is no wonder that the Gallup polls consistently show only 9-10% of Americans believe in this theory. (The number is slightly higher with higher income and education - but not much.) I wish a passionate evolutionist, like Eldredge, would take on the objective and nonreligious findings of intelligent design and the mathematical problems with evolution. Please, please, forget the bible as an easy target and deal with the scientific challenges. For a good read with a balanced view of the intelligent design questions I recommend ""Darwin's Black Box.""..."
1,Triumphalist ...,"This is just another book that attempts to enthrone Charles Darwin as the definitive prophet of science by debunking young earth creationists. The book debunks people who think the earth is 6,000 years old, and uses this as ""proof"" of Darwinian evolution.There is no doubt that creation scientists are wrong. But does that make Darwin right? Hardly.The chapter on the intelligent design movement is weak. The author can do little better than try to lump intelligent design theorists with young earth creationists and tries to prove Darwinism by pointing to the way automobiles have changed over the years.This book sucks. Even the Darwinist devotees give it less than five stars - which says something, since Darwinists typically give ANY anti-creationist book five stars regardless of its merit."
3,Science?,"This book was listed under science, however the reviews indicate that the topic is culture. Apparently, neither the author, the reviewers or the book seller bothered to notice the discrepancy. This book should be listed under religion and culture, where Dr. Eldredge's opinions belong. Listing this book under science is a self-evident demonstration of the problem ""Creationists"" have with the ""science"" of evolution.Since Dr. Eldridge's book attacks one particular minority's belief system using science, his book should be listed with other such material. As he holds a position at a public supported institution, I wonder why the ACLU has not sued him for using public monies to promote his personal belief system, politely or otherwise."
2,doesn't articulate the arguments,"I was dissapointed with this book. I was looking for a good book that could really make the case for evolution over creationism. (I am a firm believer in evolution but wanted the book for a creationist friend.) However, instead of really stepping through the logic, the author rests on claims that this issue or that issue has already been thoroughly proven. Although I don't disagree with the author, it hardly makes a compelling case for people who don't already believe in evolution."
2,Second Hand Makes Noise,"Unfortunately, this clock makes a clicking noise with every movement of the second hand. But for the price, not worth returning."
4,good cheap clock,I bought two of these clocks to create new backgrounds on them. It worked out great for that. I was able to remove the face cover and the number paper easily and replace with my own creation. The only thing I don't like about these clocks is that they are noisy. They have an unusually loud tick to them. Overall great clock for the price paid.
2,Cheap,"The case fit well, but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart. I'm very gentle with my phone, but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one. It no longer stays on so I threw it away. THe bottom is still on great, but it dosn't do me any good without a top!"
2,The American Saddlebred Horse,"I found this book to be informative in a brief way,however for a hard back book that measures 8.75"" tall by 6.5"" wide with only 48 pages it can't justify the price... As I wrote it is an informative book but not for that price."
2,"Fun, but has problems","It's a fun game, but it was problems.1. If your unlucky, there will be no objectives for island hopping, therefore impossibe.2. All the scenarios take 20 minutes.3 The game is laggy and very slow when over 3 coaster and if your Mac get hot the game crashes."
5,RCT3 is the greatest tycoon game ever!!!,"When I first got this game,I've been playing it every day!It works very well on my iMac,but it sometimes crashes once in a while.But I don't care.I really love the graphics and material they put in this game.Right now I'm waiting for Soaked! the expansion pack being in my mailbox.I can't wait!"
3,Great game!,"I love the game. Definitely worth the buy. Doesn't run fast on my computer, but that's a review for Apple."
4,Turn off clouds and shadows,"We just loaded it. Read the reviews and thought maybe since our mac is newer we might get lucky (have no problems) as son really wanted it for christmas. Froze ridiculously and was virtually unplayable until I remembered an amazon review that suggested turning off the shadows and clouds. We did it. Things were completely smooth immediately. After a few hours of play, there have been no problems at all. The manufacturers maybe need to put this on their website? Will update if this isn't the magic bullet."
2,Pretty Good...,"I like this game - it's fun to play and pretty simple. I don't like this compared to the previous games - I thought that being able to 'ride the rides' would be awesome, but i think that all of the graphics slow this game wayyyyy too much. I am also sad because it seems to quit every time I try to build my own roller coaster :(. I do save this game frequently, because it quits A LOT. And it's not like I'm running on an ancient machine or anything... I have a 2 GHz intel macbook pro with 256 mb of graphics, so I don't see why this game is being as finicky as it is. I also thought that a lot of the challenges are way too easy, especially compared to the previous roller coaster tycoons.Maybe the expansion packs will help?"
4,Fun Game,"This game is a blast, and you can lose track of time and hours are just gone. Better than earlier versions, especially because you can ride your creations. Fun for most ages."
2,BUYERS BEWARE!,Warning! This game is not like past roller coaster tycoons. Bad graphics. Runs extremely slow on the Mac. Not built for mac.
5,amazing,Amazing game! I really enjoy playing this game. Great graphics and gameplayI've had no crashes actually.
2,Thought it would be more like zoo tycoon,"My two sons, ages 6 and 9 love Zoo Tycoon. They just build and terraform zoos and then watch the animals - the game play isn't that interesting to them but they loved it anyway. So we bought Roller Coaster Tycoon thinking it would be similar. It's really not.It's quite hard to build a theme park, and a roller coaster. You have to put a lot of work into it and the work just drains the fun right out of it. The boys played for about 2 hours and then pronounced it boring and haven't played since. Maybe they're too young, but I tried it too and really didn't see the thrill."
2,Painfully Slow,"If I just sit and watch the park, the game runs fine. But if I try to open menus, build roller coasters--basically, do anything that makes the game worth playing--it freezes up for 10 seconds. I played for about two hours, then gave up in frustration."
4,Delivers what is promises,"From the box, installs good and plays well. In spite of other people complaining about errors, computers hanging and performance issues, mine is perfect. Not a problem at all. I miss the expansion packs and I wish I'd bought the complete package from the start."
2,Big Disappointment,"I had the first RCT on my 2000 PC laptop, and it worked just fine. This game constantly freezes up and gets so frustrating. I'd say that 90% of the game time is when it's frozen. The graphics are ok..... Not as good as I expected. The ""Coaster Cam"" is horrible. It's always glitching and going to other rides. I was really disappointed because the 1st RCT was awesome. Also, I found it too easy to become a tycoon. I became a tycoon in 2 days, even with the glitches and frozen screen. There are barely any rides and attractions to unlock. The tutorials don't really teach you anything. I really wish that this game ran better on my new and top-notch computer."
2,Poor performance/poor support,"I was wonderfully excited to see this game for mac but have been very depressed by the game's performance. I have a brand new, top of the line mac book pro... the best money can buy... extra memory, best processor etc, and yet this game has a terrible lag and crashes. On top of that the mouse interfaces are wretched. Even with a blue-tooth pc-style mouse the scrolls frequently lock up and, for example, right now the mouse functioning is so poor I cannot play the game. What makes this particularly dissapointing is that I have attempted to use the companies tech-support to figure out why things are going so poorly and have recieved no assistance.As a die-hard roller coaster tycoon fan I was excited to purchace this game but I would HIGHLY advise waiting until the company has worked out the kinks with this game... 50 bucks is a lot to spend on a game that does not function even on the state of the art mac computers."
2,"Wow graphics, Woe reliability","With beautiful graphics and great rides this game SHOULD make for hours of fun. Many controls are not compatible with Mighty Mouse and my standard system even though it meets (and exceeds) the minimum requirements. Multiple game and system crashes, no support info as of now on the Aspyr site. I'd wait to purchase until they get the kinks worked out if I had it to do again."
1,What a Dissapointment,"I loved the first two versions of this game (on PC) and I waited forever for it to come out on my precious mac...The graphics weren't bad, and when the game wasn't freezing up I liked it. Before I could actually use it on the mac I had to go through and change every single key and mouse command by hand because it was still set up for a PC, very annoying!! They should have waited until they were ready for it to come out on the mac and all the kinks were worked out before they released.p.s. the freezing isn't just on lower quality computers, I have a dual core processor and gigs of ram and with nothing else running I can't run this with out it freezing."
1,THIS GAME STINKS ON THE MAC!,"Bought this for my son, who enjoyed the game on a PC. Unfortunately, the game does not work correctly on an iMac. You can install and play it once, but it must be reloaded and you must start from scratch the next time you want to play. VERY DISTURBING, since this is a fantasy building game that grows over time. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE NEWER MACS!"
2,Worst RCT Game....Price is Ridiculous!,"This is the worst RCT game to date. Sure it's pretty and features awesome graphics, but that's all it offers. It's like Jessica Simpson....Really nice to look at, but not much there. Not only that but like always it is over twice as much as its Windows counterpart. The Windows version isn't even worth its price, so the Mac version definitely is NOT worth twice that!"
5,A must-have for roller coaster fans.,It's great to build and ride your own roller coaster as you learn how to take care of safety. physics and to keep a good balance of costs and profitability.
1,Doesn't work,My son was very excited to receive this video game...made for our Apple computer. It doesn't work! Very unhappy with the product!
3,Not buying the hype,"I'll concede that Melanie is a solid songwriter and vocalist. However, I must be honest in pointing out that her guitar skills are sophomoric, at best and that the ""triple threat"" that some speak to just isn't there. A close listen to her songs will find predictable, pedestrian melodies and her guitar playing skills simply don't begin to approach the level expected of her contemporaries. Does she have promise? Certainly - but, I'd be surprised to see her gain anything much beyond regional acclaim. Unless, of course, she really works on her guitar playing, or hires a decent lead guitarist."
5,Fine guitarist,"I have hundreds of blues albums and this new artist has really impressed me. A very fine guitarist, marvelous to listen to. I am not sure about the ""sophomoric"" name applied by one reviewer, and cannot credit it. A talented song writer, excellent musician and I look forward to hearing more from her."
3,as expected,Pillow was as expected but lasted all of two weeks with my 2 year old other than that it was as expected not to big though.
3,TMNT: The Preschool Years,"For some reason Ninja Tribunal was shelved and Fast Forward was aired, where the turtles and Master Splinter traveled to the future. Cody Jones, the great-grandson of Casey and April, takes them in and tries to help them find a way home.The episodes in this set are:Disc 1:Future Shellshock!ObsoleteHome InvasionHeadlock PrimePlaytime's OverBishop to KnightNight of Sh'OkanaboDisc 2:Clash of the Turtle TitansFly Me to the MoonInvasion of the Body JackerThe Freaks Come Out At NightBad BloodThe JournalTMNT: Fast Forward is a more kid-friendly version of the 2003 incarnation. It took me awhile to warm up to the new season and I'm glad that it was only on one season."
3,Good Enough,"I bought this the other day having seen it on 4Kids one saturday. I'm a fan of the turtles so whether its that great or not I'll buy it just to have it probably lol but yea this is decent enough.Don't expect it to be overly mature or as dark as the previous incarnation. It can be be described as probably a mixture of the first and the 2003 series. They don't look overly childish but at the same time they aren't that as dark as you'd maybe expect.I'm almost through the two discs and maybe its because I've only recently starting watching again, I dunno, but I've pretty much enjoyed it. It was a bit of a dissapointment but if you give it a chance its not that bad.I'm actually looking forward to season two. (I'm 18 by the way and its just as entertaining and engaging as it can be in my opionion)"
3,are they trying to bring back the 1987 show or what??,"ok so far the jokes are in-your-face style like the 1987 show,the fight scenes are getting better but at first they were missing the bad guys are just as stupid as the old show really...what's up with that? i know some people like the old show but i just don't anymore it was great when i was 5 but no longer and the theme song? well i like it but couldn't they have done1-2-3 TURTLES!!! in a futuristic style? i'm not trashing 4kids tv for anything like ost people do anymore but i would like it if they had finished ninja tribunal like they originally planned but the censors went berserk over it like ""insane in the membrane"" for inapropriate content in a kid's show but oh well i guess this is better than...NOTHING!!!!"
1,Disappointing and Forgettable,"I watched Fast Forward, and I will not purchase the dvds. Fast Forward left behind the complex, well-written, and nicely animated TMNT series of 2003+. With Fast Forward, the TMNTs are in a brightly colored, flatly drawn world of trite dialogue spoken by two-dimensional characters. There is nothing distinctly TMNT about the show anymore. Splinter and the Turtles could be replaced by any good-guy characters, with no impact on the series. It is as if the Turtles, and Splinter, were plunked into a generic storyline, instead of having an original storyline inspired by the characters themselves. I've been a fan of the TMNT for some time, and I will continue to be a fan of the Turtles. I am not a fan of Fast Forward."
5,Same book as Warrior by Marie Brennan,"I left a review for Warrior, by Marie Brennan, a couple of days ago - 5 stars. I'd picked up Warrior at the Post Exchange at Bagram Airbase, Afghanistan. Enjoying the book and half way through I thought I'd buy it's comanpion, Witch. In looking at Amazon for Witch I discovered Doppleganger and I thought it would be sort of a back story to Warrior and Witch. I received Doppleganger yesterday and flipping through its pages I was disappointed to discover that its actually the same story as Warrior but sold under the title - Doppleganger. Or did I miss something?I gave Warrior a 5 star rating. Although disappointed to find that Doppleganger is the same story as Warrior I can't justify giving it a lower rating but in a way I do feel sort of cheated.Review by Mark Grant, author of Blood of Scotland."
3,"ok, hard to understand",I just could not get into this one.the differant charactors and the names ranks and such just bogged down the story.It got too confusing to try to keep it all straight and remember.A good but predictable book.
4,An intelligent look at police life in Paris.,"This is less about the crime the story revolves around, then the day today minutiae of police work, in particular the growing relationshipbetween an eager young lieutenant, and his tough, ex-alcoholic boss -Nathalie Baye, in an excellent, uncharacteristically dark performance.There's no romance between the two, just an evolving connection.In the meantime, the lieutenant's home life is a mess - his wife isunderstandably angry because he requested his Paris posting, far fromtheir home and her work, without asking her.This sad, low key, almost documentary like film, without music or fancyshots, is an insightful look into the people who face crime every day.Dense enough that I'd gladly re-see it."
2,Dull police story,Slow-paced story about the daily lives of policemen in Paris. Not much action or drama-mostly boring.
3,Full of Fun!!,"Dekh Re Dekh is a twisted tale of greed, cunning and destiny assembled around a rather crude heist. It is a story of small people and their whopping jump to the dark side.Sometimes you watching cinema with zero expectations and get pleasantly surprised by a film that may be having a limited budget or no big stars but has its heart in its place. Dekh Re Dekh is one such film.Rahat Kazmi's debut directorial attempt is impressive.Though the pacing of the film is slow the dialogues keep you in splits and forever engaged. The ending is truly unexpected.Vijay Raaz though often over the top with some risqué dialogues, gets his comic timing right and is the most fun to watch.It is recommended for those who don't really fancy big stars in their movies and are craving for a truly `hatke' film. Go check this black comedy out; you won't be disappointed!!"
4,Better than I expected,"I enjoy chick lit but was a little daunted when I found this book shelved in the Romance section at my local used book store (sorry Amazon -- I live in Portland and we all love Powell's). I was pleasantly pleased, and frankly found it much more worthy of the Literature section than many of the C-L genre.The characters are nicely drawn, the story moved along at a pleasant pace. I read it over the course of a week and was sorry to put it down. I would recommend it to women friends."
1,Nothing elegant about this one,I really enjoyed the first few chapters and then the language got bad and the story worse. Didn't even care to finish it.
3,Emile Henry Utensil Holder,"I like it, but I expected a larger one. This one is to small.I have two black ones I purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond and theyare large."
4,Utensil Holder,"This is a nice ceramic holder. Has a wide mouth, and is tall enough that the long utensils stand easily within. I was hoping the color would be true to the picture, which looks slightly more ivory than white. But, it is a true white color. Overall I am happy with this piece."
5,great utensil holder,"I love this! It's heavy enough that it doesn't tip over with a lot of utensils in it, and it's a great size, and very attractive."
2,Poor packaging,"Although the packer put plenty of bubble wrap around the outside of the canister, they forgot to put it inside the thing. So it came all tightly wrapped but totally smashed inside."
5,Remarkable,"This is a remarkable little book. It is vastly different from any of the other ""self-help"" tomes out there, and I've read a lot of them. Where many books explain what happened to you in your childhood and maybe even why, few give you a clue as to how to deal with the emotional issues that arise as you pursue recovery. This book is deeply compassionate and empathic, and takes you step-by-step through the process of dealing with those emotions. Reading it gave me the courage to dive back into some painful emotions I had been denying for a long time -- and the author was right, once I had done so I felt an incredible sense of freedom and relief. There's no moralizing here -- nobody is shamed or labeled ""bad"" or ""wrong"" -- there's just a lot of support, compassion and respect for what it takes to grow and heal. I hope this book finds the wider audience it deserves."
4,Excellent but be careful,"Jenson's book is excellent in helping you define past abuse and stop minimizing, denying, etc. Her tone is helpful and she shares that she, too, needed healing from childhood neglect. That said, regression therapy can be very dangerous to do alone. Get a sympathetic therapist, one familiar not only with childhood abuse and neglect but Jensen's work, too. I wouldn't recommend doing it all on your own or with non-professionals--the deeper the trauma, the more abuse there was, the more serious the abuse, the more likely you will tap into very strong and deeply buried feelings that can wreck your day, week or month until you work through them. I used the book on my own and had to find a therapist to help me sort through everything.I stiill refer back to her book, esp. identifying ""old"" feelings v. the present situation. Be careful, though and have plenty of professional and family/friend support, esp. if the abuse you suffered left any signs of PTSD or anything like that."
5,A good person with a bad past!!,Kennedy Assassinated was an awesome book. I think that this book is very incredible in detail because it gives you all details about how Kennedy survived his life and how he got through it all. I think that this book is awesome for anybody that can read. If you are interested in history then this is your kind of book. Please take this and remember that he was a good person but he lived a bad past. The best story element for this book would also be suspense. It tells you of what happens and how it all happens. Thank you for listening and I hope that it helped you.
3,"Nice enough, but . . .","I bought this album because she was coming to the area and I wanted to know whether it would be worth attending, my own Norwegian roots, and my previous good experiences with Northside records, but I've got to say it's probably the weakest of the 10 or 11 CDs I own from that label. I don't exactly disagree with the ""official"" review above, I just like a little more oomph to my traditional music. This verges on the new-agey, lots more slow than fast moments, and while she clearly plays incredibly well she doesn't get too many chances to show off on these tracks. It's good enough, you should just know what you're getting in to when you buy it.I didn't end up going to the concert."
4,wonderful,"Fantastic, only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that their albums with more extended versions of the music are even better. A knockout Klezmer recording."
4,Good Service,"The book came within a week, although my daughter was unhappy as it was used, but I was happy as I saved 60% off retail."
4,Relaxed; comes with stunning visuals,"This album was a pleasant surprise. While not as diverse and upbeat as my favorite ""Hed Phone Sex"", it is nice, relaxed, and diverse - with a good mixture of shorter and longer tracks. While the tracks are relaxing, the album certainly won't make you fall asleep - but it is certainly is good music to read by.The DVD that comes with this album features about half the tracks and comes with visuals that are at times stunning, at times funny, and overall make it a long trippy experience."
3,"Not Bad, but old news","If you're already a fan of SEC football, most of what you read will not come as particularly insightful; although it is interesting to read passages regarding Alabama's recruitment of Albert Means, which may have played a part in the NCAA's investigation. There are some factual discrepancies here and there, but if you're looking for an introduction to SEC football, this is a great place to start...for those of you that are already big fans, there may not be much here for you.To the guy in Bradenton: Before you start ranting about the author's lack of geographic knowledge, you might want to do some fact finding of your own. Hartsfield (not Hartsville) is the name of Atlanta's (international) airport."
1,One of the worst,"I think I have read almost every book about football written, and I was excited to find a read about my favourite conference. Before I reached the third chapter, I knew I would be dissapointed..... I have never seen someone butcher a topic of such interest to me. Say what you like about Fienstein, but at least he can string two sentances together. Save your money and buy A Civil War. It ten times better."
2,Bragging Rights disappoints,"As an objective observor with no strong ties to any particular SEC school, I found this book very poorly written. He tries to write a Feinsteinesque account of a season in the SEC, but fails miserably. For one, he feels the need to constantly write about his own feelings about people- these are irrelevant in any well written book. Also, he makes Vandy coach Woody Widenhofer out to be the best coach in the SEC, a rather interesting thing to do considering the Commodores never had a winning season before he was fired this fall. But Ernsberger does this kind of thing a number of times- including a chapter where he ranks the abilities of the SEC coaches- begging one to wonder: what makes him qualified to do this. But the book's main problem is that it is boring- the chapters aren't connected to each other, and it keeps the book from flowing in any logical fashion. It was a good topic, but it was not a good job."
2,A biased account with at least a few errors,"I found some of the book merited reading, but it is obvious who the author's favorites are--especially his alma mater, UT. It looks more like a disgruntled fan's attempt to slap down the almighty Tide. I was surprised that an author with a master's degree from Columbia would make spelling errors in his book, as well as factual errors."
4,Great gig bag for the city!,"My holton bell front didn't come with a case, and trying to find one that would work for me was hard! I pretty much only use public transportation to get to practice and concerts, so having a case I could manage on trains and buses was a must. This gig bag has been perfect for that! Just throw it on my back and I'm ready! I have bumped a few people with it, but that's to be expected with a horn on my back and a crowded bus!My ONLY complaint is that one of the zippers for the front pouch broke -- since there's another zipper there it's not a problem, but it was disappointing.My horn fits snuggly and feels secure! It's been the perfect match for this urban euphist!"
1,Pretty pictures. Little information.,"I was somewhat disappointed in the synopsis for this book. It led me to believe that it contained useful information for the collector. Unfortunately, it did not do so for this collector. Those starting out in knife collecting should look elswhere for reading material."
3,Tabletop book of European Knives,"Small but pretty book that will show you a lot of pretty pocket knives, mostly of European origin. If you want to see all the different types of pocket knives and how they evolved, this is an interesting book. If you are trying to learn more about American made pocket knives or identify the knife you have, this is not the book you want."
3,Heavy and not so resonant,"OK, this is built like a rock and the built-in mounting system is pretty handy. The block is heavier than I expected and less resonant, though."
2,"Fictional I know, but almost totally inaccurate - Save your money","I was disappointed with this book because although, I knew in advance that it is fictional poetry, most if the information it communicates about Daniel Boone is just completely inaccurate falsehoods. As a Boone descendant and historian, it was a disappointing read. The author appears to have written many things based solely on rumor without even doing any verifiable research. Otherwise he would not have written a lot of the stuff he wrote - good example; ""D. Boone Kilt Bar on This Tree, 1760."" Things he says about Boone and his faithful wife in that ""poem"" are untruths and writings such as this only perpetuate false rumors. I would love a book of poetry about Boone - this is not one. It is a book about some fictional character that bears very little if any resemblance to Daniel Boone the real person. The author of A Companion for Owls does not know Daniel Boone."
1,Doesn't Work,Tried new batteries twice. It didn't keep time. It was off by 2 hours after one day of use.
3,Good for grammar - but little else.,"After learning the basics of Arabic from this book, I stopped reading it. It feels like a phrasebook, just spewing random vocabulary that doesn't really help you.On a positive note, it doesn't just teach MSA, it has other dialects.I've heard that ""Mastering Arabic"" is a pretty good book. Try that instead."
3,explanation of product,"The CD's that come with the textbook are just the oral pronunciation of the written arabic words. Ive done the first few lessons and it seems helpful for beggining to become conversational in arabic. If you want to learn to write arabic or read arabic, look for a product that is more specialized in that area."
4,Sunshine and Shadow-excellent,Another excellent book following the adventures of Benni Harper and her extended family. Love the references to quilting in this series.
5,Great book!,What can I say? I love this series of Bennie Harper mysteries. I hope she considers writing more of Bennie Harper.
3,Book: Sunshine and Shadows,Paperback copy of book. Few pages came loose from the book and then the last few pages were missing!Thankfully I could piece together the ending from the next book in the series. Wish it had been available in e book format.
1,Junk science at its best,He obviously puts his political motives above scientific evidence. A clear waste of time.
1,This is what science should NOT be.,"While the issue of bias in science is quite important because it deals with ethical, academic, economic and political issues among others, the approach of this publication is quite a dissapointment. It is an example of how either economic/political agendas bias the interpretation of science and reinterprets other's conclusions. Unfortunately it falls exactly into the same arguments it criticizes and it does so in a quite simplistic and boring way. There are many really good books that address this issues. This book is just a waste of paper and ink."
3,"Nice playing, lousy mastering.","The cover art is what hit me in the alleys of the Jazz Record Mart as I stared at the huge poster @ the checkout. Very cool. It had that 70s, afro-funky, 'Shuggy Otis' feel to it. Never heard of this guy before, nor had the store clerk. Not a big blues fan (as could be mistaken from the cover and the period), so waited to read reviews here and then buy it. Great playing for sure, in fact somewhat a mix of Shuggy and Carlos, but someone needs to shoot that engineer who supposedly 'remasetred' this. The bass is hardly audible and everything sounds mucky. I'm sure the sound roars on LP. Never heard it more than twice, despite some good playing, thanks to the poor audio.....and that's a shame."
1,Eddie Fisher?,"There is no Eddie Fisher that I ever heard on this album. It is the worst, the very worst, ""music"" I ever tried to listen to. If there were a minus zero rating available, that is what it merits."
2,"Excellent condition, rotten content.","Excellent service by the seller; great book condition. But the content of the book is light, easy to find somewhere else, and not very useful."
5,An Enlightening and Authentic Journey. Exceptional!,"Individual Power is one of those rare books that speak to your soul. Barbara Rose reached me, the me behind my walls, defenses, and excuses to help me realize who I am, and helped me realize that I do have a purpose after all. She shares with amazing authenticity, and the enlightenment that she contributed in this book has helped me understand a lot more about how to create the life I never knew I could have, as well as how to manifest it all with the spiritual help that is around all of us. This book has had an immeasurable impact on my life.A MUST READ for genuine self growth and transformation, and a Must Share with others!"
5,Individual Power at its Peak,"Barbara Rose brings fantastic information straight from the heart to help you thrive in your life no matter what experiences you have undergone. Her book addresses many issues within our society as she `speaks out for the voiceless masses' with a daring so bold, and solutions so true, that anyone who reads this book will have no choice but to open their eyes and their hearts. With respect to part three `Evolving Spiritually' this book will help you understand your grand connection to All That Is. After reading If God Was Like Man and Individual Power, I can honestly say that Barbara Rose will be long remembered for her outstanding literary contributions because they are life altering, and come from Divine Truth. Highly recommended!"
5,Brilliant Insight and Solutions that Work,"Individual Power is another extraordinary contribution from Barbara Rose.I was given perspectives on how to live with the truth that many times I was fearful of, particularly with respect to personal relationships, as well as how I have not been true within my own self. This book brought me the guidance and insight that lit me up, and took me on a journey to my new life that lies ahead.I was awakened as to my role in society, and was ignited with a new passion for realizing the diversity of ways in which I can serve. Individual Power explained much regarding spirituality, and I now understand more. I have utilized some of the recommendations in this book and have already experienced astonishing results.Between Individual Power, and If God Was Like Man, I have a new lease on life. I highly recommend both books to anyone who wants to be rejuvenated in all areas of life and perception."
5,Powerful and Incredible Wisdom. Get This Book!,"Individual Power was an answer to my prayers. I didn&#65533;t know what to do with my life. I was going in circles, distressed, depressed, and feeling futile at every turn. Through this book, Barbara Rose gave me the answers that I have been searching for my entire life. I learned how to create the life of my dreams. I learned about the gifts behind so much suffering I have been through, and how those lessons serve me in moving forward. I learned I am not the only one who has been through tragedy, but most importantly, I learned how to turn it all around. Thank you Barbara Rose for bringing me the gift of direction, inspiration, and clear guidance.I am deeply grateful for your phenomenal book!"
5,Incredible Insight and Inspiration,"This book hit home in so many areas. It will awaken you, inspire you, and help you to become all you came into this life to be. I found Barbara Rose to be so genuine and authentic daring to share how she overcame her greatest weaknesses, and helping to uplift us all from her wisdom and experience. This was Barbara's first channeled book, but it reads in first person, just as if you were sitting with a sacred friend. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to create a life that is so spectacular you would not believe it is the same life. Barbara shares how to do this, from the inside out. She speaks out for others who are less fortunate. She speaks to your soul, and shares how to evolve spiritually. This book is one to keep and return to. I found it as fascinating as her other book, If God Was Like Man. That one is so different, and yet the contributions in each of her books will awaken, inspire, and enlighten you.Highly recommended."
4,solid,"this album is tight and dark, very strong. dalek raps well and comes up with some truly sick wall-of-noise type sounds, loops, and beats. there is a good sense of song here--the swells and breaks are intricate, heavy, and purposeful--dalek has a handle on each track's direction, and nothing comes across as formulaic. ==excellent underground hiphop=="
5,Great,This came with everything it said it would. I'm completely happy with this buy. It fits in the dash perfectly.
2,"Good bulb, wrong color!","Okay, this is a first for me. I have purchased many coralife bulbs before and have had saltwater aquariums for 11 years, however, never had an issue like this with new bulbs. I got this bulb in, along with the 10k bulb from the same seller to replace the two bulbs that have blown on my minitank. The 10k is good. The actinic bulb arrived in the manufacturer box, but without the cardboard insert for protection. That wasn't a problem, bulb still works and Amazon packaged it great. Upon power-on, the bulbs had the exact same color! First thought was that there was a mixup, but the bulb said actinic too! Not sure what to do with this bulb now, so two stars because it works, but only two because the phosphor is obviously not actinic."
2,Typewritten book,"This was not the book I wanted and it was difficult to tell because no cover was available. It had the correct title. The information therein was okay, but it was on old thick stock (which is not bad it and of itself) but the words were typewritten as if done on an old manual typewriter and in brown ink--not the most reader friendly. It arrived on time and in relatively fair condition."
1,Worst bra ever!,"This is the worst bra I've ever purchased. Terrible fit in my normal size. Unfortunately, not returnable so I'm stuck with it."
3,?????,"I bought this bra a very long time ago, and for the life of me, I cannot remember what it was like. I'm very sorry."
5,These guys are awesome!,"I just saw these guys live. They are way cool! As in disagreement with one of the above reviews, I do think this CD should be classified with Christian and Gospel. That's what kind of music they play and that's what's in their lyrics. They have faith in Jesus. As do I. These guys bring it, and they bring it for God."
2,You may not love it...,"Yes these guys are talented, but if your into the rapcore scene, you may not love it...save your money. Listen to it before you buy. Their message is awesome, so that's why I gave it two stars. Maybe it's because it sounds like the Newsboys trying to be hard that I didin't love it......I'm not one to be negative , but I just wanted to put a difference of opinion in the reviews."
5,110% by pat croce,Pat Croce did a wonderful job writing the book 110% he is a master motorvator and always look at things in a postive way. I couldn't put the book down once I started to read it. Since I have red the book 110% I have started to have the same attitude that he does. When I ask people how they are doing they say good and why they ask me I am doing great. this is a must read book and one that you will enjoy trust me!!!!!!after reading this book you will say I FEEL GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Fun, but not the best WCW tape","Watching this tape now after everything in WCW is all said and done, it is kind of fascinating. This was the pre-Monday Nitro and pre-NWO WCW here with Hulk Hogan. It is kinda fun, but the whole event could have been so much better considering the talent involved! There are some truly lackluster matches here by todays wrestling standards! Well, this was WCW's style in 1995.Sting has on OK match with Meng. Sting is a good wrestler, but Meng is not. This match kicked off the show and it was slow and not really any high spots. The matches that fallow are of varing quality, but most of the matches are slow-paced and not very exciting. The best matches were the two main events, I thought. Savage vs. Ric Flair was fun and even Hogan vs. Vader was ok, but not great. The fun parts are all the interviews and the clips of various happenings in WCW at the time.If you must buy this, try to find a used copy like I did. Otherwise this is a decent time killing rental."
2,You may have seent his on TV before...primetime that is.....,This match was used in a baywatch episode and that reason alone it should not be bought.
3,Doesn't work without additional purchase,"This is a good program, but cannot be sold used, as it must be registered (like any microsoft software). I was fortunate enough to have already purchased a new Bible program, so it could be added on to my other.As far as the content, it seems to be adequate and enjoyable for my 6th grader so far......"
4,Mystery Pacific,Quintessential Django jazz from the Pacific Northwest. Great music and reasonable quality for a used out of print CD. I was satisfied with my purchase.
3,"OK, room for improvement","First off, on the plus side: This player is truly portable, running for a good many hours on a set of 6 ""D"" cell batteries, or on the supplied AC adapter. The turntable is good, with accurate electronically controlled speed (including 78 RPM- A big plus to many vintage collectors), adjustable pitch. The tone arm is borderline unacceptable. Heavy weight with way-too-much skating tendencies, so much so that the sound is unbalanced in the headphones as the stylus is always being pressed against the left side of the ceramic pickup element. The built in amplifier and speaker are just barely loud enough to hear in a home setting- forget a noisey environment. The headphones are your only choice here. Am I sorry I bought it? No, as I got it for an excellent price- But had I paid full price, it would have been sent back."
2,Gives mechanical vignetting for DSC-H2,"I bought this for my Sony Cybershot DSC-H2(not through Amazon) and getting dark rings on the corners. I am using lens adapter which came along with my camera and did not use any additional filters.You can prevent them by zooming in a little, but that defeats the purpose of using wide angle lens.But I am happy with overall image quality for this price.In addition to vignetting you will get dark shadows on the bottom of the picture taken if you use built in flash. I guess this happens even if you use expensive lens as the lens will always obstruct flash light."
2,Distorted pictures,"I usually don't write reviews, however...I thought this was such a great deal, but wanted to tell others that if you are looking for crisp photos, don't buy this lens.I just got back from shooting some photos out on the river and ocean. They looked good in the LCD, but when I opened them up in a photo editor I was highly disappointed. There was a black ring, just like the other reviewers mentioned, and the photo was distorted around the edges. Even the middle of the photos seemed off like you took a photo with a cheap plastic lens.I should have known better. The price was too good. The lens seemed like it was nicely contstructed."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,"I made the mistake of thinking, or maybe not thinking, that between Amazon and 47th Street that this would be an acceptable substitute to the more expensive lenses out there. Boy was I wrong! The lens not only vignettes but the color is washed out and the focus is soft to fuzzy. All in all you get what you pay for and in this case I didn't even get what I paid for.STAY AWAY FROM THESE LENSES, THEY ARE JUNK!!!!!!!P.S. I have not heard back from 47th St. about a return for credit after 4 days either. I will update that part of the situation."
2,lens attachment,This item did not live up to what I expected it to do for my camera and I feel I wasted money...lesson learned
5,"powerful, honest, truthful and spiritually uplifting","I loved this book and could not put it down. It tore at my heart strings and lifted my spirits. To the author, Kim ..Thank you for such an honest and incredible book. Even more importantly thank you so much for what you do at Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch. I have every intention of visiting and supporting your cause. I was so moved by the heartache and the triumphs of each story, each life and each journey. There was so much honesty and thoughtfulness in each recount of each chapter. To be able to capture the power of the human spirit (in even small packages) and the willingness to still be magnificent .. (in the ""angels in horse hair"") was such an amazing thing to witness. Thank you for noticing, thank you for sharing and thank you for sharing it with others."
5,Wow *sob* Amazing,The one story of the little boy and the horse that hugged him...well you're just going to have to read it. This book is filled with wonderful stories that is a must for every horse lover out there! (Christian or not)
5,Hope in Places You Would Have Never Known,"This amazing collection of hope ridden stories is yet another inspiring piece of work by Kim Meeder, owner and operator of Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch in Oregon.These stories reach inside your heart and tickle your soul in ways that you might never have thought. The reviews sometimes recommend having a box of tissues handy, and that isn't a bad idea if you are an emotionally moved person. You won't find yourself crying through the entire book though, because sometimes those tears will still be falling as a sweet smile or laugh crosses your lips.Kim Meeder has an amazing way with words and can powerfully tell a story that will give you hope and inspiration in a world that needs a little more.I highly recommend this to anyone who is struggling with their faith or just wants to learn more and explore their relationship with God.These kids will amaze you, as you hear their tragic voices change to words filled with hope.I really hope we see more from Kim Meeder."
4,Inspiration,"Great inspirational stories. Some can be very sad, but worthy of the read. If you love horses, this will make you very pleased there is someone out there like Kim Meeder that loves horses, and loves God, and together they save as many of the horses that they can. Her work with the children, has in my opinion saved many lives , and made them look at themselves in a whole new light"
5,Awesome Book and Author!,"This book is filled with amazing stories that will captivate you. At the end of each chapter, I kept saying ""just one more..."" Got the book years ago, but still find myself paging through it time and time again because it is so good. Went to Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch in 2008 and had Kim, Troy, and some of the staff sign my books, so they are even more special to me. Definitely recommend this and all of her other books! :)"
5,A TRULY INSPIRATIONAL BOOK,"This is the single most beautiful and inspirational book I've ever read. I am not a church-goer, or a holy-moly or even a believer in organized religion, but I do believe in the Great Spirit as well as the human spirit that makes the connection with animals, and vice-versa. My spirit has been healed many times by animals, and most recently by my Pepper (our 5-year old Appaloosa who comes from a youth most horses would not like to have) and I'm far from ""young"" anymore !!! So the connection with animals can help any age. It is a very easy book to read, even if you think you do not have the time. It is broken down into very short chapters that can be read in 5 minute (or less) spurts. So for us busy people (and yes, I work full time with 3 kids and lots of pets) it's very readable - Do yourself a big favor and get it."
3,Who is the audience for this book?,"My rating of ""It's okay"" for this book was due to the fact that I felt that the stories were in many ways a little bit juvenile. Although the stories were interesting, I found myself becoming bored quite early on in the book. feel that it was geared toward a much younger reader. I would, however, recommend this book to anyone interested in animal storie as the writing style might not bother other readers."
1,Preachy,"I did not know that the book was actually a sermon on Christianity, very little was about the people and animals.I did not expect that, and would not have bought the book if I had known."
5,I wish I could give it 10 stars!,"What an inspiring collection of stories this is. You get to feel any number of emotions as you read of the abandoned and abused horses, the abused and lonely children, and the heroes that work so hard to rescue them all. Woven into each story is Kim's faith and optimism that gives us all hope for the possibility of healing the atrocities that are found on the earth. I'm just finishing the second volume, ""A Bridge Called Hope"" and love it as well. Thank you, Kim, for sharing your heart, your faith, and your optimism in such an open way. We are all the beneficiaries."
2,Can't See the Forest for the Trees,"In this fourth work in a series involving Grant vs. Lee, the author continues to lose the reader in the details. I am appreciative of the author's indepth research, but his insistence on including every letter and diary that he can find does not make his book better. The first two books by this author were both highly readible and insightful. In this volume he has completely bought into the revisionist viewpoint of Grant and Lee, i.e. that Grant has not received nearly the credit that he deserves and that Lee is vastly overrated. In the context of the Civil War period covered in this book, there is some truth to that. Though this book makes some valuable contributions overall I did not find it up to the standard set by Rhea's Wilderness and Spotsylvania books."
3,Very detailed,"One for the scholar. Incredibly detailed, so well researched, very informative, pretty heavy and serious but most enjoyable a great study of both Armies and very interesting analyses of their leaders success's and failings."
4,More of resource book than a feelings book,"This handbook, written by Doug Manning, is meant to give you an overview of what happens when someone dies, and the choices that need to be made. It is a very easy read that is meant to help you prepare for the funeral and deal with people who do not understand your loss.I especially love his story on how the book was named and how he developed a new compassion for those that grieve.A young mother said, 'Don't take my grief from me. I deserve it. I am going to have it.' Though he did not hear the words spoken from her mouth, those words haunted him enough to change the concept he had towards those that greived and the recovery that would follow. He began to understand that though we need to recover and move on, we also need to experience the loss and move in our own time, not someone else's.Alyicehttp://goodmourninglord.com"
2,"Title has promise, but doesn't deliver","A friend gave me this book when my daughter died. The title was so perfect that I expected great things from the book. I was sorely disappointed. Even though it has been years since I read it, one passage still rings in my ears. He says that, even if a grieving person requests no flowers, one ought to send them. I was outraged that anyone would reject the wishes of someone who is newly bereaved so casually."
5,Full House: Selling Rooms & Space With Style & Grace,"Stephanie's writing style is engaging and encouraging. The information is fresh, her advice is right on the mark and when applied to real life situations, actually works! I highly recommend this book to everyone in the hospitality industry. Newcomers and veterans can benefit from Stephanie's expertise and kindly guidance. In addition, she is a truly gifted speaker with tremendous appeal. Her audiences have given consistant high marks on the quality of her delivery and the value of her information."
5,Great Reference Material,One of the most comprehensive and information books on the market in it's field. Anyone interested in selling rooms/meeting spaces should have this book in their reference library!
2,"It's Short, But Feels Long","Although I enjoyed some of Spawn, I'm not a Tod Mc fan, but this book still sounded intriguing so I decided to check it out.After reading through it, I realized that it had nothing worth remembering. There are a a few VERY cool panels, but they don't really even involve Creech. There are a few neat story elements, but it's all very trite. This is the first time I've ever said this, but there is TOO MUCH character development, or it just wasn't done in a way that was palatable.I would suggest putting the $10 this book costs towards Haunt and it's ongoing story; as I see it as the better big brother of The Creech."
4,A must-have,Greg Capullo is the definition of a selftaught master. Would get that last star if Todd McF had done the inks.
3,Good lotion,"I am pleased with this item. Not exactly what I expected in the firming department, but it did an ok job, but does moisturize good. helps to give skin a more smoother appearance, and isn't greasy."
1,Dreadful,An unbelievably pretentious and boring polemic on a less than fresh subject. A waste of time for any other than the dryest and dullest of academicians.
5,Awesome!,"I will never go back to Wilton bags! These are so nice. The quality is great, the bags are thicker and stronger than Wilton's. The price and quantity is amazing too!"
5,Heavy duty and durable,I used wilton bags before these. I have never had one of these bust out. And the price is awesome too. I will definitely be purchasing these again. Extremely high quality!
1,Disappointed!!,"These pastry bags are not soft at all. When squeezing, though the content inside the bag came out at the tip, it also leaked out at the top and I only filled less than half. The material is too thick to twist and tuck, not suitable to use as a piping bag...but may be use as candy bags."
1,Brush does not stay sharp,"Brush spread out after 3 months.Tried to contact customer service by email and by phone. They do not respond.I am very disappointed in this line. Worst customer service since Sears Catalog, and that was bad."
4,Good book.,"Not as detailed as the factory manual but more than good enough for DIY. Compare the price to the factory manual, It's definite a good buy."
4,Great tool.,"I purchased to help me with my current position in collections. This book has some great ideas, as well as letters for all occasions."
2,Know the FDCPA before putting letter to use,Most these letter appear to be in violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. I did not find it very useful for anyone trying to run an ethical business.
4,They Work,These are good filters. I have stopped smoking now and they did help. They are good. !!!! I would reccomend them.
3,ITS OK BUT.....,GREAT TO USE ON CHEAP CIGARETTES. IT TAKES THAT BAD FLAVOR OUT. MAKES THEM SMOKABLE. I BOUGHT MINE AT A GAS STATION. ALOT OF THE TIPS CRACKED OR BROKE RIGHT AWAY. MAYBE THEY WERE OLD?IT WORKS PRETTY GOOD THO. WONT FIT ON SLIMS TYPE CIGS LIKE V.S. SLIMS.COOL INVENTION. YOU CAN SEE THE CIG SLUDGE BUILD UP RIGHT THROUGH THE TIP! THEY GET LOADED FAST. ITS EXPENSIVE BUT YOU GET ALOT OF TIPS IN BOX
5,Excellent Service,I have always received excellent service from this vendor and the product helps remove a lot of the tar from smoking.
4,Nic-Out filters,"It has been about four months since I started using the Nic-Out filters and I don't think I will ever smoke another cigarette without using them. When I first heard of the filter I thought it would be like smoking air, but I tried them and seen that this was not at all the case. I could sense no change, except now if I forget to put on a filter and take a hit it's a gross taste to me. I see all the tar build up in the filter and can't believe that was all going into my lungs before I used Nic-Out. I have managed to start smoking extremely low tar and nicotine cigarettes called Quest, which I don't think would have been possible if I had not starting using the filters. I am 29 years old and I have 5 young kids, last year I had two pneumonias which I think was contributed to smoking, but now since using the filters I haven't coughed in months."
1,Waste,"Save your money and buy another pack of cigarettes. You won't use these. If you smoke around a pack a day like and look forward to your cigarettes, than this isn't for you. It restricts the flow of smoke too much, and feels strange putting plastic to your lips. They don't filter out as much tar as I had hoped, and I still end up craving another cigarette immedietly after because I did not get that satisfied feeling. So much for slowing down. I'll switch to a light cigarette."
4,I enjoyed it!,A nice CLEAN romance! Hooray!!! I wish more authors would put time into the story and leave out the smut.
5,Mrs. Drew Plays Her Hand. Loved this well written Regency novel.,"""Mrs. Drew Plays Her Hand"" was a wonderful sweet romance. I couldn't put it down and I'll read more from Carla Kelly."
2,was a bit bland and too predictable,the summary promised a good light and entertaining read but in reality it was rather bland and predicatble plot development . The 'bad character who later seems to become good is just not credible.
2,"Except for the airplane, a total waste","I had hoped that this kids' movie would be an entertaining introduction to the famous aircraft. Instead, it is an insipid,uninspired waste of time and an insult to the intelligence and taste of viewers, whether they be kids or their parents. Hanna-Barbera cartoons were never on the intelligence level of others such as Warner Brothers (Bugs, Daffy,et al), but at least in their heyday they had SOME entertainment value. This later effort by the studio is truly lame. The voice 'talent' sounds more annoying than even when the actors were in their prime, and the script is beyond ludicrous. Unless you are a desperate collector of cartoons featuring Yogi and his unfunny pals, or are a devoted collector of any films that feature historic aircraft, you will probably be better off spending your money elsewhere."
3,SHOCKED!,"When I purchased this book I thought I would get more information on the history of the heel, such as the sumtuary laws that only allowed royalty and other aristocrats to wear heels. This is where the term ""well Heeled"" comes from. Instead I found a book full of pornography.Here we are in the twenty first century and women are still viewed the same was as they did centuries ago. It seems that when I do research on anything pretaining to women what I get is porno. This is an insult to someone who has mothers, sisters, and aunts. I returned this book because I have a daughter and I don't want her finding this book and wondering why I would have something like this in my library."
3,You can get Office Account Express 2007 for free,"QuickBooks is, deservedly, the standard bearer of small business accounting software. The new Simple Start version is meant to make it very easy for the small business owner to get started in everyday accounting (probably more like bookkeeping to purists). However, I want to alert you to Microsoft's free Office Accounting Express 2007 which offers the same features but is truly free. You can download OAE at ideawins dot com, a Microsoft website. The OAE 2007 was recommended in the Nov. 15, 2006 New York Times.Whichever software you choose, good luck with your business!"
3,Incomplete accounting software,"I suppose that this software does what it says it does, but I am frustrated that it lacks the ability to hold payables for future payment. You need to upgrade (at additional $'s) to get this feature. Otherwise, it is easy to use and intuitive. I especially like the ability to make changes and deletions to entries. This is great for someone like me who has little knowledge of accounting. Overall, I would say that this is adequate for the very small business, but plan on the upgrade as the business expands."
1,DO NOT think this can be used to update,"If you have a previous version of QuickBooks...any previous version...this is NOT the version to buy. It will not convert any previous data and when you go to uninstall it and send it back, your old version will no longer work. Oh, and your files will be moved so you couldn't even find them if the previous version did work. I hope Intuit gets what's coming to them at some point and I hope I'm around to see it."
3,Quickbooks,"Guess I didn't read enough. If you already have QB and do payroll, this is not what you want. Now with the 2007 versions - if you need to do payroll, you'll need QB Pro. Fortunately, QB did an upgrade for me at an upgrade discount, so I didn't loose the $ totally."
2,Bait and Switch with Simple Start,"I read the review saying Simple Start didn't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version. Despite the warning, I thought I could get away with Simple Start because I was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program. Even for my simple needs, it was a bust I had to upgrade to Pro for an additional $100. If Quicken isn't enough for your needs, get Pro."
1,Complete waste of money,"If you are buying this product because it is the cheapest one Intuit offers, excpect to get what you pay for. If your needs are really so simple that this product will work for you then you would be just as well off using a spreadsheet, or downloading the free version from Microsoft, or even using their home version with business added. By the time you figure out that you need better capabilities it will be too late to return it.Bottom line, if you want a good Quickbooks bump up to the Pro version, so you can get real Customer and Vendor management, and a decent overview summary, and multiple category levels."
5,flippin awesome,"It has made my bookkeeping for my small business soooo easy. Invoices in a flash,keep track of your expenses so easily. This program was the best investment and tax deductible! Very easy not complicated!!"
2,My opinion,"I was disappointed with this album. I bought it because I wanted the song ""I Want A Hippopatamus For Christmas."" The man singing the song on this cd is not the voice I wanted to hear. All the songs are sung by other people than the original voices I was hoping for. So, I would not recommend this album unless you really don't care who is singing the song."
1,superficial book,"This book is extremely superficial and unimaginative, giving only scant information and profiles from a number of companies of a few finance careers."
1,Awful Stickers,"The stickers in these bowls are absolutely terrible to remove. The product appears to be quite nice, but the sticker removal left residue and discoloration."
1,Wait til you try to get the lables off of this bowl.,"The bowl itself is of good quality but you will spend more time then anyone should have to removing the labels. Hot water, goo be gone, lighter fluid with lots of scraping all used to remove them."
4,Very sturdy,I dont know what all that sticker stuff was that everyone was complaining about but mine was on the side and came off fairly easily. I recommend drying the bowl right after washing since the water marks are very visible when it drys.
5,Love this bowl,"I initially got this bowl to fulfill a promotion. I didn't expect to be using it as much as I do, but I find that I reach for it almost primarily in the kitchen. I love the capacity, it's of solid construction, and the rubbery coating is genius for keeping it in one place while I'm whisking. Plus, it's (so far) survived numerous trips in the dishwasher."
3,"A bit sticky, and not very rugged","I bought this SudoKube for my brother as a gift, he is an avid Rubix Cuber, and very good at it.He said that the spinning was not very smooth, jammed up a lot, and he could tell that if he spun it too hard, and it decided to jam, the corner pieces would likely break.However, he was pleased with the design and layout of the numbers.My personal opinion: I wouldn't buy this one exactly. I noticed that all center pieces were fives, which means that each side is basically the same. I thought it would be a bit more challenging, with each side having all nine numbers, but not necessarily in 1-9 order. All sides are 1-9 in order, with 5 being the center number on each side. A bit easy if you ask me.Hope this helps."
4,A must see horror movie,it was a good story. the story keep me glued to the tv to see what was gonna happen next. I recommend this movie.
1,Won't work in some computers,"I got this for a promo - tried it in about 4 different computers, it won't fit in many USB slots because the shoulders of the surfboard prevent it from going in far enough."
3,Encyclopedia of Garden Plants,"This is an excellent book only if you know the name of your plants. If you are looking to find out what the name of a specific plant is, the book is just way to huge to go through page by page to find out its name."
5,The Webster's Dictionary of Gardening!,"This book is the basic encyclopedic reference every gardener, lawn-care, or landscape professional should have (or at least know where to find). Some books are meant to be read. Others are meant to be looked at. This one is both. The text is clear, the ideas are well organized, the photographs and illustrations are professional and appealing. I made a gift of a copy to my lawn-care professional. Not only was he delighted to receive it, but my lawn looks better because I could point out ideas and how-to pages that he could put to work."
4,Good reference but a little overwhelming,"This book has just about every plant you can imagine but it has its drawbacks because of it. It is extremely heavy and you must know the scientific name of a plant or look in the index for the common name to find it in the book. I guess I was hoping for a little more ""user friendly"" book. It has lots of pics and might be great for the more experienced gardener."
4,Now that's what I call information!,"Let's just say, you will NOT need to use any other book for a gardening reference after using this one! It has all the information needed for a beginner or an expert in gardening. This book is huge, heavy, and packed with information. This helps you pick the right plants and flowers for your specific needs. Now, my favorite hobby is even more interesting and fun for me."
2,"great pictures, bad info","like others have said .. the pictures in this gigantic book are slick and glossy.. there are tons of plants listed.. the problem is .... a lot of the info is wrong ... i have found the plant heights and zones are different than other books such as hortus III, sunset western gardeners etc ... the pics are great ,, but i wont even opoen this book any more because i dont want the wrong info stuck in my head.... if they re-edited , corrected this book and added a little meat to the info it would be one of the best and the $50 would have been worth the money..."
5,American Horticultural Society A to Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants,I just purchased 3 more of this book because it is so complete and great that my 3 children keep borrowing mine.
5,A-Zplant guide Horticultural Encyclopedia,"I have been through my book, cover to cover twice so far and the second time through I found plants I thought were missing the first time and both were in photographings of said plants. It(the book) has helped me tremendously as a Master Gardener in selecting plants to propagate wisely for the community butterfly gardens I am now planting from the plants that I have grown from seeds or cuttings at least 90%. The other few were from wise purchases. We(mastergardeners) keep this bible in the shelves to assist the Master Gardener answering the ""hotline"" with questions about any kind of plants or problems people in Polk County, Fl have to ask our help in solving. I will probably be getting one on propagation to complete my needs and if one for Florida exists, it will be one that I review! I bought the encyclopedia so I could have it at home for personal refrence.Master Gardener for Polk Co., Fl"
5,American Horticultural Society A to Z Encyclopedia,This is an excellent source of information about plants and the photographs are wonderful.
3,Maybe not what you are looking for.,"The book sounded exciting with the large number of plants described by other customers. I do like DK's large amount of pictures. The book did contain a large section on roses. BUT this might not be what you are looking for. If you want a book to help you choose say a type of apple tree to grow in your backyard, this book will not help. Sunset Western Gardern Book offers detailed descriptions of each specific varities of popular fruits: taste, tree growth, disease resistance,etc. Peaches,apples,grapes,blueberries,cherries,etc."
2,The Title of this Book VERY Misleading,"I bought this relying on the title to reveal the contents. This book is angled toward Americans, and it lists the AHS hardiness zones, the common names used in the States and such; but beware, this is book is not written by Americans. Check the credentials of the editors, which is given straight off in the front of the book. The information contained within is very good, but clearly lifted from the RHS (Royal Horticultural Society). This will be apparent when the text is studied. I was disappointed. When will the AHS come out with a real ""American"" reference? Why must we keep using foreigners as our experts, dear AHS? We have AMERICAN experts. Use them."
3,grossly inaccurate,Just reading up on the plants in my garden turned up numerous inaccuracies. Salvia Clevelandii is listed as being a dwarf variety. Coulda fooled me: I have one six feet tall. Ipomea indica which is not listed as being hardy in my zone has engulfed the back of my house and is growing over the roof. Platanus Hispanica is not supposed to grow in my zone. Whups! I just planted two. Oddly enough they seem to be thriving. Somebody better tell the landscaping companies to stop planting them all over town.And so on it goes.I will give the book three stars instead of one because the pictures are wonderful. I love the pictures. It is useful to flip through to find pictures of that mystery plant I spotted on my walk.I would pair this with the Sunset Western Garden book. The Sunset book for accurate information and this book for good photos.
4,Good for serious gardeners,Even this huge book can't have everything but it is probably the best available. We have wanted it for a long time and were not disappointed.
5,Helps keep my dogs acting like pups,"This is the most amazing product! Nothing like glucosamine or other stuff I've ever tried. A few years ago, one of my Shih Tzus could barely walk. I've been using this for years and both of my 12-year old doggies run, jump, have no hip or back problems. It's really amazing. I attribute their good physical health to this product. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Product,"Really helped my dogs hip problems. Could hardly walk before taking this product, but now she is doing great!"
3,Book is outdated,"This book would have been 5 stars in the late 80's to early 90's. The arguments that the author made were valid arguments, but the book is out of date regarding the author's comparisons to children's televsion shows, advertising, and children's toys."
4,new photo album,"I do a lot of scrapbooking but I dont like the albums without the protective covers on them, so the magnetic page photo album is a great choice. JoAnn is a great company/seller. They keep great communication and helped me when I had some issues with my shipment. I totally recommend and trust this seller! Will shop again!"
3,pages are too narrow,"I brought this album to store my photos in. I have about 300 pictures of my twin boys that I wanted to store in the photo album. In the picture of the album, it gives the illusion that you can fit 3 to 4 photos on a page. This is not true at all. A regular size photo is all that fits. 2 per page. You might be able to fit 3 if you can cut off some of the top or bottom of the photo. It's not wide enough to fit pictures next to each other either. The book is wide enough but the pages inside are smaller then the book and the sticky part is even more narrower then the page. I wanted to buy refills and they were about $3.00 for five pages. the book costs $6.00 for 100 pages. The math doesn't make sense. I was a little mad because now my pictures of my boys first year is going to have to be in multiple albums.I don't recommend this album. especially for large projects"
1,[item price] for this,"Very hard to follow along. No story line. The grammer and syntax was horrible I would think something listed on amazon. com would go through a screening process before being released. It sounds to me like the author is trying to toot his own horn. Most parents with a schedule as busy as his would barely have time to concentrate on the needs of their children, let alone write a book. Something doesn't quite measure up."
3,oily not the best,For the price get l'Occtaine 20% shea butter hand cream. It soaks in better is not greasy.
2,Not worth the money,I can't believe I paid $8 for this little tube of hand cream. I was suckered into the Bliss name and had to try it. I needed to re-apply more after less than an hour. I'll save my money and next time buy three tubes of my Nivea Sooth Indulgence Hand Creme. The product puts the expensive Bliss product to shame.
5,Learning Alot From This One,Am doing the study in this book and am being very blessed! Getting rid of some confusion I had concerning spiritual gifts which Paul said he would not have us ignorant of.
3,Great tasting Cerel. Like cookies! But cost too much!,"Crackling Oats Bran is very habit forming so I don't get it often :) It's very delicious and crunchy like cookies. High in fiber too.The cost for me to get this was very high. After S/H I paid over $10 per box - way too high. I won't likely buy it again from this source because of that. However, I did get it in a timely manner and the vendor was very enthusiastic and personable. If only they could lower the cost it I would be a regular."
1,Pretty unhappy with this case,"ok for shock protection, but here are the cons:1. Crappy looking.2. Can't see the keypad once you put the glove on.3. No protection for the screen."
1,How can you dial the phone with this thing on?,"It covers all the buttons on the keypad, protecting them from dust, moisture and from being read and used. A pain to put on and remove. Useless design. Mic hole way to small to be heard properly. I had to cut the keypad section off and use the perimeter for phone cushioning. A full leather case is a better investment."
3,Read the fine print,"I was disappointed to find that the book was an older version and not the one pictured for sale. Even though it was a used book, I didn't expect the binding to split when I first opened the book. Having to tape the pages right away was not fun.:("
5,Great Anime,"This is a great anime, 5 of 5 stars!!! hehe just one thing, there are cuts on this version like scenes, and Im not sure, but I think maybe some episodes are missing if you compare from the original japanese version."
2,A bad toy,"This toy REALLY stinks. It's really slow and makes a lot of noise. I gave it a five star educational value because it teaches you not to buy stuff that lookes fun, but to reasearch it first."
2,broke the first day,this toy broke the first day we opened it. It also goes VERY slowly. My 5 year old was so disappointed by the lack of speed.
4,brooke...,"I'm a huge fan of Brooke. The song ""everything to me"" is not my fave song by her. But the song is good. I can't wait for the cd to come out I love her songs ""i believe"" ""Caught"" and ""cant stop this now"". I wish her all of the best in her music career."
2,Another Generic Pop Song,"Here's another half-anorexic teenage girl who actually thinks she can become something. Maybe she will. Probably she won't. Her first single ""Everything to Me"" sounds like every other semi-hit pop song that goes to Radio Disney for a month and is then forgotten forever. I was reading that Brooke is the next Britney, but even though I'm not a major Britney supporter, Brooke ""Hulk"" Hogan can't even begin to compare herself to a-list singers like Britney, Christina, and Hilary. She either needs to wait a while and find her inner musical abilities all over again, or just accept the fact that she can't make it and fade out before she begins."
1,Doesn't work,Bought this and can't get it to work or even update online. Everytime I try to use it I get error messages. Don't waste your money.
3,"Fun, but with limitations","This is a great toy for young kids with ambition of becoming a ""secret agent"" when they grow up, but as I said it has limitations. The toy won't break easily, but a 50ft range is not enough. The fact that the button-cell batteries weren't included infuriated me, and I eventually found myself dragging two 6-year olds to the hardware store nearby, who didn't have them. I eventually went back to Amazon and bought 10 button cell batteries, just in case, and my children jumped with delight when they came. The Verdict: My children split up, and before they had gone two backyards away each, the range cut out. This is a fun toy to use around the house, but not reliable and NOT including all necessary pieces."
5,Badmitten forever,bought this for my son's family - set it up the day it arrived (July in Phoenix) - they have played it every day since - good gift!!!
3,"Lots of stong points, but also lots of weaknesses.","As far as I can see, there are only three reasons I watched this entire season (and am working my way through the second): (1) Margery Daw, (2) Marchosias, and (3) Rie Kugimiya.Margery and Marchosias are the only characters who are actually INTERESTING. Yuji? Dull, and refuses to die. Shana? Cute, but blandly predictable as the resident tsundere. Pretty much everyone else? Dear god, they can be fun, but they're also DUMB. The whole show is dumb, really, leaving it up to the funny, flawed, obsessive, and gratifyingly complex Margery and Marchosias to provide a much-needed dose of real character.Rie Kugimiya did Shana's voice, however, and I'm a hopeless sucker for her tsundere voice acting (even if she was 10x more interesting in Toradora)."
3,2 sides to every story! and...what are the ethics?,"Just keep in mind that there are 2 sides to every story! Just as there are some crazy families out there- there are some crazy nannies too!I do question the ethics of writing about this (without disguising names/families) You are exposed to such an intimate circle of family life it just does not seem quite right.I once had the pleasure of sitting next to (on a plane) a lifetime nanny, who had nannied for a royal family and was with her current family (a beautiful young woman with a fairly old gentleman!)She said ""oh if I could only write a book, no one would ever believe me!""That's the point- she would never write an expose, she was a trained nanny and viewed herself as a proffesional. Someone with a high level of ethics is the type of person I would want as a nanny, not someone who wants to cash in!"
5,"Living the So Called ""Good Life"" isn't so Good, after all..","This story has a lot to teach all of us about what we assume wealth buys. It goes beyond what we have always been taught... ""Money doesn't buy happiness"" even though many of us have secretly believed...""if only I had that much money, I KNOW I could live happily ever after"".....I suggest you read this funny and surprisingly insightful memoir and have your mind changed, just like mine was. I wish this former nanny all the best and would like to thank her for taking the risk to write this book. I will never look at Hollywood the same again."
5,I bought this book after a nanny conference... loved it!!!!,"I heard Suzanne speak at a nanny conference that I attended a few months ago. After hearing her read parts of her book at the conference, I knew that I needed to buy it (I guess that may have been part of her purpose for reading it aloud to us in the first place, LOL). Well, it worked, I bought the book and I'm glad that I did. It was very funny and I was sad when it ended (like I always am when I read a good book and feel like I ""know the characters""). I liked this book soooo much better than the Nanny Diaries."
5,A VERY FUNNY READ!!,"My wife was reading this book for her book club and I picked it up, thinking it was a ""girls book"" I was wrong..(hard for me to admit since it happens so rarely) but I really liked it. I grew up in a small town and could really relate to the stories that the author told, I hope she writes a follow up to this one."
5,Nanny book review,"What an excellent book!! I laughed so much, and so hard, at the adventures and misadventures of Suzanne. This definitely will show you, within her stories, what you do NOT want to do when accepting a Nanny job.I am currently training to become a Nanny at the same school Suzanne went to. This book has come in handy to help me know what and what not to do when I start looking for a job."
3,Feeds that hungry gossip monster!,"About the adventures of a nanny in Hollywood who worked for a well-to-do film industry family, the book is well written in an entertaining fashion that intigrates notes and quips about such stars as Sylvester Stallone, Goldie Hawn and Dustin Hoffman. My only complaints are that I wish it had been more ""meaty"" with jucier tidbits about the stars that the nanny came in contact with. Also, she really gets pretty negative about the family she worked for and after awhile you get a sense of ""poor me"". Over all though, it's a fun book and worth the $$$."
1,Badly Written and Boring,"This book is so poorly written, it is almost embarrassing to read. It just isn't funny, it's boring; in fact I read it with a morbid fascination wondering how much worse it would get. I finally gave up after asking myself why am I making myself read a book that is making me cringe at the author's lack of literary skill, humor, and artistic talent. The Nanny Diaries it isn't."
5,Have to read it!,"This book was hilarious. I loved her journals, they gave a look into what she was really thinking and feeling, even when she appeared calm and together on the outside. It's a total crack up! I was happy (and a little embarrassed) to read I wasn't the only one with the ""all occasion black dress"" - I just never knew how many occasions, and how many different ways it could be used! Her ability to laugh at herself is refreshing."
3,Transaction,"I was impressed with the delivery time. The price was a lot cheaper than CVS or Rite Aid, when they have it in stock."
1,Not for me,"Not a fan of this product. I have heard that it works, but not for me. I feel like a drug addict when taking chaser because you have to keep track of how many drinks you have and take a number of pills throughout the night. When I'm out having a good time, trying to remember to take chaser after a certain number of drinks is the last thing on my mind. Maybe it didn't work because I didn't follow the exact dosage instructions. I have purchased and reveiwed a similar product called Drinkin' Mate Natural Hangover Prevention Tablets, 6-Count Packages (Pack of 2) and let me tell you, this product is a lot better!"
5,These really do prevent a hangover...no joke.,"Well if you're going to choose to poison yourself with alcohol since it's become socially acceptable to do so, then why not combat the next day repercussions with these Chaser pills? These always save my butt the next day as long as you remember to take them while drinking. I don't drink alcohol without a few in my pocket."
3,"Definitely helps, does not give me freedom from hangovers.",I've been taking this for the last semester or so at college. I get awful hangovers pretty easily. If I have say ten beers in a night the next morning I will be dry heaving into a trash can in a cold sweat. With this product I wake up without the nausea but just have a wicked headache. I would say if you were going to have around 6 drinks this would be a good product.
4,Actually works,"This product works. If taken as instructed, it will minimize your hang over and make your day after productive. Of course it requires water and sensibility but prevents the headache and nausea with a typical hang over."
5,Believe in Chaser,"I was very much a nonbeliever in Chaser until I tried it. I followed the instructions and it worked. So, now I have a new drinking buddy Chaser."
5,Never hung over again!,"I haven't had a hang-over in years ever since I started taking these which has been about 3 years, I believe. I take them just like they show on bottle and so far they have worked with Rum, tequila, whiskey, beer and wine. Not to mention Long Island Iced Teas, which has Vodka and Gin also in them. I will not drink without them now. I didn't have any faith really in that they would actually work... Glad they did! Wish I could find them at a good price even if I had to buy a larger quantity though."
4,"Simple, straightforward display","Purchased this item as a display for a simple automation controller. I had used similar models with small-scale point-of-sale systems in the past. Price was hard to beat at $14.99; the display just plain works, no muss, no fuss. Plugged it in and was off and running. Display contrast is quite easy on the eyes, with a warm white display with amber overtones.Highly recommended if you need a simple, small monochrome display."
4,"Stupid, yet funny game.","This is probably one of the funniest Role-Playing-Games I've ever played. The character history part of making a character is probably the funniest part. Also, this game has boozing as an abilitiy."
2,"Good for price, but flimsy quality","Great amount of cards for the price, but they were very small, and the quality was flimsy. Very thin paper. However, I bought them for my friend for her bridal shower and she seemed to like them, and used them."
3,A War Silent,"It is World War I and the Russians are at war with Austria. An Austrian (James Hall) is wounded during battle and is separated from his regiment. He takes refuge in a hotel where he is found the next morning. Anna Sedlak (Pola Negri) and Elias Butterman (Max Davidson) know that they face serious consequences if the soldier is found in their protection, but they have loyalty to Austria and hide him. Anna falls in love with him, and her love leads her to risk her life for him in the face of the Russian occupants.Negri fans will no doubt flock to see this movie, but it is less exciting than one might hope. Hall is certainly an attractive leading man, but the romance gets few chances to ignite, and without sufficient growth time, the ending is less than climatic. The most exciting part about this film is the direction, masterfully done by Mauritz Stiller. The scenes are perfectly balanced, making for an artistic film, if not an entertaining one."
2,BEWARE. May be very uncomfortable to use.,"The product is well made and goes together easily. Unfortunately, if you have a cast that goes up almost to the knee, all the weight of your body will press against the cast and into your leg below the knee. This makes the Knee Walker extremely uncomfortable after a few minutes. Try this:1. Put a folding chair with a padded seat in front of you.2. Bend your ""bad"" leg so the cast is horizontal.3. Place all your weight on the cast with the chair underneath.If this doesn't cause any discomfort, the knee walker will probably work OK for you. Thick carpet, going backwards and tight spaces (constantly lifting it to change directions) are annoying, but if it weren't for the extreme pressure just below my knee, I could live with it."
3,Video review of Drive Knee Scooter,"Length:: 1:34 MinsAs an independent distributor, Goodbye Crutches can offer any product. We purchase and test them all and tell you what we found. Drrve Knee Scooter (Knee Walker): The Good: 8"" Wheels, Folds Small. The Bad: fits patients 5'6"" to 6'0"" tall. The Ugly: The mustard brown color. We decided NOT TO OFFER this product. [...]"
2,Rolling Knee Walker,"I had this unit about a week before it started falling apart, I ended up putting new bolts into it. I was using this because I broke my ankle in 3 places, I was using it to come to work one morning when it fell apart it was painful getting into work without the use of this. It is bolted up pretty good now but the rear wheels keep turning in it makes it hard to use in a straight line."
2,terrible to steer,"I have to say that I like the fact that no crutches and more mobility as well as being able to carry things with it...BUT that being said, this thing is impossible to steer with one hand as my instructions said to do. I wish I would have spent a little bit more and got the one that you could steer.It is also very dangerous on any rough terrain or floors that have cracks. I had a total rupture of my achille's with tendon graft from my big toes and I am looking at 12 weeks non weight bearing. The thought of 12 weeks makes me physically sick to my stomach so really really wanted this to work...and it does to some degree. I dont feel safe anywhere but inside with it though..."
1,terrible customer service,for one thing this knee walker does not have steering so it makes it very difficult As soon as I got this item in the mail the doctor said I didn't need it now and I tried to return it but they would not let me This seller is terrible this knee walker is just sitting in my house I lost 169$
3,Worked Well...For a While,"The stapler worked fairly well for the first few days, but after about a week, it went downhill. I'd try to staple just 2 sheets of paper together, but it wouldn't work properly. I did everything exactly the way I had the first few times I used it, but no matter how many times I tried, the stapler wouldn't even make the slits properly."
2,Won't last long,"It immediately looked like a great idea...to not use staples. The first time I used it, it worked just dandy. It took one to work and tried to ""punch"" 4 pieces of 20# paper together. That was a bad idea. The little Eco Staple Free froze and it took a bit of work to remove the papers jammed in the little thing. I'm afraid it never survived after that. Its little metal knife inside just swung loosely. Tossed it in the trash. I believe that you are instructed to not use more than two sheets at a time. However, I don't have the instructions, so I cannot confirm that. It is certainly a conversation piece, but will not replace the utility of a real stapler."
3,Disappointed,"While this stapler works with 2-3 papers, it's not very reliable. And it does leave an unsightly mark on your paper. If you are one of those people, who likes their things picture perfect, then this certainly isn't the product for you. But, I do applaud the eco-friendly approach =)"
3,"good idea, needs work","I love the idea of this- compact, no waste, no need to replace staples. It works by cutting a little tab out of the papers and looping the tab through a slot made by the initial cut. It's easy to use, and it comes in lots of different colors and designs.However, it only works to attach a few pages (about 4 thick or 6 normal sheets), and the attachments it makes don't withstand much force at all. So if, like me, you put your papers through a bit of a workout (rereading, shuffling, in and out of bags), you might want to wait for the next model of this ""stapler""."
1,Pitiful,"I was very excited about the prospect of this item and even ordered 2 of them for stocking stuffers. It does not work. Doesn't even begin to latch even two papers together. Amazon would do well to drop it from its offerings, as it is a sham."
1,Does not work.,Chews up the corner of the page and t looks unprofessional. I bought this because someone at work had one that worked like a charm. That tells me that the product is inconsistent and thus an unreliable purchase.
5,Great Product,Does what it is meant to do. We were very please with the product and ended up ordering 3 more.
2,POOR QUALITY,This filter is not nearly as good as the essix air filter. It only lasted 1 month and started smelling fishy and the paper got dry and hard so it wouldn't wick water any more.
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"I ordered a Bemis filter but received one made be Best Air - whoever they are. The filter does fit the Bemis humidified and seems to work adaquately but is not the brand I paid for. For an off brand, it was pricey also."
5,wick filter,"Same deal here--this filter fits my ancient humidifier, and it works. Great price, speedy shipping. What more can you say?!"
2,Bulova,"The watch was beautiful but the battery died within six months and even the jeweler counld not get the back off for replacement. In the efforts of two of them it became scratched from their tools, Ending in a useless product for me. I've since thrown it away."
4,The end of one era and the beginning of another,"This volume looks at Austro-Hungarian forces during the second half of the Great War. During this period the colorful distinctions of the Austro-Hungarian army were going by the wayside, replaced by the very german-looking field green standard uniform. This book provides illustrations of the uniforms as they became more ""common."" A very good reference and an interesting book in its own right."
5,Very Informative book,"This Men at Arms series has been a huge help with my short story writing - mostly because I'm a visual person and the illustrations within are fantastic. My only complaint is how impersonal these books are - I wish there were more about the soldiers themselves (i.e. letters home, heroic stories, etc). The book sort of dehumanizes Austrian soldiers by solely discussing their tactics and weaponry. It needs more personality..."
2,.....,"this item was not in much good condition at all. i would not buy this product again, if i did it would not be online."
3,Hands On Fun For Baby,The simple dialog makes a sing-song cadence that 4 to 12 month olds love! Baby can grab on and shake with you. The soft fabric and plastic rattle even survived a few trips through the washing machine! A favorite book for all four of my children during their first year.
1,"OK as a toy, not great as a story","The text of this book doesn't flow or make much sense. It should have been left as a picture book only. On the up side, it makes a nice rattle noise and is cloth. Also, watch out for the cloth book, ""Jingle Bear,"" -- it has the same problem!"
5,The What: Turn It Up,Track Listing:1. Turn It Up [Radio Edit] [3:56]2. Turn It Up [Original Vocal] [3:57]3. Turn It Up [Remix Mr. Speed Style] [4:39]4. Turn It Up [Instrumental] [3:56]5. You & Yours [Original Vocal] [3:32]6. You & Yours [Instrumental] [3:31]
4,Hammer films long awaited titles released on DVD!,"Any fan of Hammer films and/or Christopher Lee cannot wait to snatch up this rare item. Be aware casual Hammer Film fans these are not Horror films but action/adventure. Many familiar Hammer actors and directors. So if you are a completist of the Golden Age of Hammer like myself,snatch up this DVD collection."
5,Icons a Must for fans of Obscure Hammer!,"After all these years, we finally get a copy of Hammer's ""Stranglers of Bombay"" on DVD...and there's three more obscure Hammer adventure films included on two-discs and they all look and sound awesome. Buy this now! Let's send Sony a message that there are Hammer fans out there willing to part with their hard-earned cash for a great, great bargain. You know who you are!"
4,HAMMER MEANS ADVENTURE!,"Hammers Icons of Adventure are not bad, the best one is Devil Ship Pirates and Terror of the Tongs,a little bit of a let down with Stranglers OF Bombay not as good as advertised,the Pirates of Blood River is the least of the bunch but still at the price not bad and you get Christopher Lee too in several of the films so that makes it worth it."
4,Icons Of Adventure,Excellent choice of films from Hammer. Hope there are more of this type coming soon. Some of their not often seen non monster films such as the Brigand of Khandahar and The Crimson Blade.
3,Fun Christopher Lee adventures,"If you're a fan of Christopher Lee this collection is a worthwhile one. He appears in three of the films--none of which ever show up on tv or video shelves with much frequency--and gives great performances as pirate captains and a Chinese crime lord.The fourth film (Stranglers of Bombay--the only one of the three in b&w;) is less enjoyable and doesn't have Lee in it, but is still fun.A major flaw of this films is the casting of Europeans as Asians while actual Asian performers are forced to stand around as extras. It's a sad commentary on the times and how racist we were not too long ago . . ."
3,Pure Hokum from Hammer,"Hammer collection of their ""adventure"" films is not to everyone's liking.However, Stranglers of Bombay is worth buying. The other movies can be either ""take or or leave it"". I bought the collection for Stranglers only.Andy Bowman (filmfundi)"
3,Useful for boat storage,"Boats are used in water so there is always a mildew problem. When we store ours in the winter, I hang several of them - more than the instructions say is necessary. There is no mildew in the spring. I leave the ones in the bath and hanging locker during the summer.Since I live in a humid climate, my closets smell of mildew in the summer - or they did until I started hanging these in the closets. The smell gradually cleared.Addendum: Although the product is supposed to be the same, it now comes in a plastic case instead of a cardboard hanger. My original 5 star review was for the bags in the hangers. Those in the plastic box with vent holes don't seem to work quite as well. I am experimenting with putting them in the used cardboard hangers which I still have. My boat is stored for 6 months, and one month mildew prevention doesn't do me any good. I have downgraded my rating to 3 stars."
5,Works great,I've used these for years. The first winter I tried them I was sold when spring came around I didn't have to deal with mildew after winter storage.
5,Like this version better than the new one,This is the product that I have been using for ~8 years. It works very well. The new Star Brite mildew control product has too many restrictions compared with this version of the product.
2,One Month Not the Four Advertised,"I just received the items, which look the same as the product advertised but the directions say it only works for one month, not the four advertised. Perhaps it will work for four months, if it does I will change the review. Thanks."
1,Wrong product,"I don't know what others have been getting when ordering this, but I did not receive the product pictured and listed. What I got are not bags, but rather trays. In fact, they are this item, which I also purchased recently for $4 less:Star brite NosGUARD SG Mold/Mildew Odor Control System (2 Pack)Returning them. Would have liked to get this item, since it says good for 3-4 months, whereas the one sent is good for only 1 month. If you get the product pictured it might actually be worth the price differential, assuming it really does remain effective as long as promised."
3,careful,"When I bought this several months ago it was displayed under HTC Hero compatible. I don't see that tag now, so hopefully it will now show only for the correct phone, but just triple check and contact the seller for a detailed compatibility description before buying. On the plus side, it's pretty cheap so if you make the same mistake I did you don't lose a LOT of money."
2,"Stiff, poorly designed cables","The cables on the headset have a nylon braiding overtop of them to make them ""tangle resistant"". The problem is when the rough surface of the cable rubs against itself it comes through very loudly into the ear pieces. Poor design. Other than that it works and is comfortable. Just don't walk with it on!"
3,Pay attention to the hole size!,"I bought this faucet and it is well made. Unfortunately, I bought it from a different vendor who didn't note the hole size. This won't fit Belvedere bowls. If you do have a Jeffco bowl make sure you get 1/2""inletX 1/2"" outlet angle supply stops, because that's what this faucet has on the hose connections."
5,Good news!!,"Fantastic news for all Hellsing fans! Thankfully, Funimation have picked up the liscences that were dropped by Geneon. Although I'm curious as to how Funimation will deal with the continuation of the OVAs, they are trying to use the same voice actors and similar packaging to enable current customers to complete their 'set'. Hopefully Funimation will keep up the great work Geneon gave to the Hellsing OVAs.As for this DVD, if you like the previous OVAs, you've got no choice but to love this one too, more blood, more action and this is where the real story of Hellsing begins. This OVA covers from mangas (end of) 2 - (beginning of) 4. Everyone who reads the mangas will now know how great the story becomes from this point on :DThanks Funimation!!Let the awesome story continue..."
5,Wonderful buy,"As a true Hellsing fan, I can say that this is a great buy. I was so happy with volume 3, and I will be watching excitedly for volume 4. Only problem is mature content, don't let younger viewers see without at least feeling comfortable with its content. As any real Hellsing, or just a vampire fanatic would, I apperciate this as a great show of blood, gore and twisted humor."
5,The third chapter is getting better!,"Though I thought part 2 was more violent, part 3 is just was full of blood and gore. I felt that some scenes were a little rushed. But oh well, it's still a great anime. I can't wait to hear this in english.The story involves the introduction of Pip, then the South American motel massacre and finally showdown battle between Alucard and Tubalcaine Alhambra. One of Millennium's members. Buy the dvd. You won't regret it."
2,pretty but inaccurate,"This is a very attractive thermometer and easy to read, but it's off by 5 degrees or more most of the time. As soon as we opened the box and saw that it was reading 60 degrees in our warm house, we had a bad feeling about it, and it has continued to be inaccurate outside in its shady spot in the yard. But if all you need is a very approximate idea of the weather outside, it's OK..."
3,Fun! -- and see --,"Super-advanced technology -- from astronauts in shorts (because one is a woman, and this was written by hypersexist Robert Heinlein), to 1950's-style Big Bullet Boobs (tm), to my favorite technological advance of all time/s! --the ""gravitometer"" -- so sensitive it even measures gravity during weightlessness!Don't miss this (unless watching one's diet concerning cholesterol-rich cheese) or ""God"" will be angry!"
3,A very mixed bag to watch,"A very mixed bag of things to watch. Women astronauts at a time when the government wouldn't even consider such a thing, cordless phones (maybe the inventor got the idea here), people walking on the floor AND the ceiling in the space station(I liked that).Cartoon character Commie spies and doubles, grade school kid quality lunar landing(hadn't these people ever heard of using a wire to lower the model?), inconsistent treatment of women in the script (respectful then patronizing). The cheap spacesuits bothered me but I did think it was interesting the way they simulated lowering the astronauts to the surface of the moon, I just wish their little model men had been a little higher quality. Better than Rocketship X-M."
1,I Want My Hour and Four Minutes Back!,"I love watching these B-rated sci-fi shows on Saturday afternoons. Usually, the cornier the better. But this was so predictable and undeveloped that I felt that it was a sad waste of time. Donna Martell was obviously some producer's favorite casting couch pick. The scenes went out of the way to showcase her figure but highlighted her poor acting ability. Yawn!"
1,so bad its....its....its BAD!,"there is no way to say how awful this is, and i make this statement behind heaping amounts of forgiveness and understanding for its creation in the early Cold War years....actors just barely able to say their lines, a story so corny as to stretch credulity beyond all reckoning, sets apparently done by teenagers for a high school production. you watch a film like this expecting bad, but entertainingly so. but this was just....BAD"
4,Project Moonbase DVD,"This is a typical 50's era SCI-FI movie - except no alien monsters, the enemyis ""the evil empire"" as well as a stranded situation. Also had some more up to date notions - Woman astronaut, but they sneak in at the end that it is a woman president who pushes her carreer, instead of just letting it be - she is qaulified. I guess they needed the tension between the two main characters. - still if youu like this type of movie - it is a entertaining."
3,or 2.5 stars...,"...kind of weak vhs film quality; the movie was kind of boring-needs more action. yay, hayden rourke-dr bellows of i drm of jeanie is in this. this show kinda reminds me of war of the satellites-(better show) in that these films both have a sabotour in them."
3,well......,"I'm one of those ""love cheesy sci-fi"" people that you either agree with or (like my wife) put up with. So understand that I enjoy bad 50's science fiction movies, and the worse the better. But this one was less 'cheesy' and more 'really bad acting' than I care for. I had a hard time making it through the whole thing. The story itself wasn't the worst I've seen, but Donna Martell needed to retire just a little bit earlier than she must have. I hope her dad was the producer, and not that she was hired for her acting chops! This will go to the bottom of the pile for me."
3,Spies in space,"Shorts, tight t-shirts and funky skull caps are the uniform that will be worn for space flight in the 1970's. Actually this movie was somewhat accurate in the depiction of space flight. As seen through the eyes of people in the 50's im sure this was pretty high tech thinking. A commie spy forces a landing on the moon and the astronauts must find a way to survive for they cant get back to the space station. All in all a charming slice of cheese from a time at the hight of the cold war."
2,"Fun to watch, but only because it is fantastically bad.","This is quite possibly the worst screenplay ever; loose ends abound. It plays like a dream which jumps from one plot element to the next and never returns. Add to this the ho-hum acting, and you'd expect a really rotten movie. However, it is worth watching at least once for its visual effects which were quite good for the early 1950's. Between the silliness of the script and the interesting space effects, I'd recommend this movie for anyone who ever intentionally watched 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and enjoyed it."
1,Pissed,"Love the songs on both albums, but after buying on amazon I see that my copy is edited. This is junk to me now. I see no warning labels saying this its edited but there is also no parental advisory sticker either. Why would a hip hip cd be edited?"
1,notgood,The thermometer started leaking after a couple of weeks and within 3 weeks the readings were 15 degrees off.This is a waste of money.
1,Just Little Ole Oswald,"This is another book with ""proof"" that Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill President Kennedy. The forensic evidence and analysis all points to Oswald. Even Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (who I am not particularly fond of) say all of their attempts to discredit the Warren Commission report have failed. Reluctantly they concede that the case is closed - Oswald did it. Dan Rather said something close to ""I always have an open mind, but basically, the case is closed.""As for the French assassin being deported-did he have ""French Assassin"" stamped on his passport as his occupation? Give me a break. Hearsay, hearsay, hearsay.The evidence speaks for itself. It is just too unbelievable to some people that a loser who craved attention could climb six floors and shoot the president. Deal with it. It happened. The forensic evidence points to the loser Oswald."
2,Some good info but the wrong conclusion,"This book is actually worth reading, because it provides some worthwhile information about people related in one way or another to the assassination drama such as Jean Rene Souetre (sometimes accused but not actually a player in it) and Carlos Marcello (one of the players). The book is worth while for what the reader can learn about those individuals and their role (or lack thereof). But I can't give it more than two stars because the thesis of this book just isn't accurate, and there really isn't much in the way of evidence presented to support the authors' conclusions about the root cause of the conspiracy that killed President Kennedy. Nevertheless, if you'd like to know some things about Souetre and Marcello that would be hard to find elsewhere, then check out this book."
3,"Fair, but missing parts","The flag was nice, but it's missing the metal garden pole that it lists as included. Then, the buyer has to pay for the shipping postage."
2,The Firebug Connection,The Firebug Connection is a book that kids like me will probably not get. IT has advanced words and I don't like it. The story plot is not that interesting. It is a mystery and the things that the people think is causing the problem was confusing and not understood by me.
3,A great book,"It was a good book. Even though it is about bugs, and I hate bugs. But it is still good. It is basicly about a girl who studies bugs and has to watch a boy named, Mitch. The characters are pretty active. They don't really hang about bugs and insects. There's phantom along with the fact that the story tells so much more about science than a regular book. It is a gret book for people who are studying science. This is a popular book and it has many true facts. It will help people undrstand the main idea of science."
3,The fire bug connection,"This book is about a thirteen year old girl named Maggie. The setting is at bug camp. Then she got a present for her thirteenth birthday by a guy named Capek. The present was fire bugs. Then they started to die and she wanted to find out what was killing them. She was thinking it was paper from the trees, so then she went to the mill to see if the trees were making them die. She thought the trees was killing them because they think there is a hormone in the trees and there was a hormone in the trees. The hormone was stoping them from growing and then they eventually died (poped)."
3,Sacred Underworld Expansion Pack,"This was a hard title to get a hold of, but so far it is worth it. Very pricey for an expansion, but it adds almost a games worth of game play to a game that I already liked."
1,Ripoff--disable ware,"Don't buy software you pay good money for only to have it disabled! If I had known this was going to be disabled prematurely, I would have never had bought it.After getting an error message that the subscription was invalid, I call support and was told the software subscription was up despite the fact that I still 4+ months left on the subscription renewal.All I asked for for was the entire year subscription I purchased 11/7/2005 and am able to use the product (System Works 2004) until that time. I think that's reasonable, legitimate and legal as there was no agreement that I would have purchased another product to have the registration time applied to the product.While the software I bought was SystemWorks, I don't think the draconian software policy would differ across products.Now the product is disabled and EVERY service is disabled as well. That means, no virus scan, no disk doctor--nothing."
1,Don't waste your money,"This software package simply doesn't work. Even if you follow the instructions perfectly, it won't install correctly. Then, you're left with a light wallet and a locked up computer. Not my idea of a performance improvement! Now, I'm left with a crippled computer hosting a Norton program that won't uninstall - customer service is a joke too. If you're having performance issues, please please please, save your money and just buy a new computer."
4,Does what I want it to.,"I did not buy this product because I wanted to see what it would do. I bought it for my laptop because I have been happy with the way it performed on my desktop. I was pleased that I could buy the Basic Edition without Norton AntiVirus because I already had Norton AntiVirus on the laptop.The products I was looking for were Norton Utilities primarily for Speed Disc, One Button Checkup, and Norton Cleanup. These are all easy to use and will straighten out the minor bad things that happen to your software just from everyday use.I'm a virtual computer novice but these programs work and do what I want them to so I guess I'm happy in my own uninformed way."
3,Norton Basic - no AV,"I've been using Norton products for years, but never any of the ""Basic"" versions. I've never had any trouble, and used Norton System Works often. So when I upgraded, I went by lowest price, not realizing (didn't read the fine print) that NSW Basic didn't include the Antivirus program - my mistake !!! I subsequently had to buy the stand alone version of Norton AV. BTW, it doesn't integrate itself into NSW-Basic."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money on this useless, overpriced product. It does not contain Norton Anti-Virus so just pay your $29.99 to Symantec to renew your 2005 subscription. When I opened the box and realized how utterly useless this product is, I returned it un-opened, only to be screwed out of $24.00 by Amazon for a ""restocking"" fee. Please, learn from my mistakes."
5,AMAZING,"This product saved my virus infected computer. The software isn't that easy to use but not too complicated. The product is highly recommended by me. My computer had tons of viruses but now it's starting up quickly without taking 10 minutes to start up. Im very happy with this product overall, it's one problem is if your computer wont start up you cant boot from CD but you can save a computer as long as it still starts up."
1,Beware,"Even after I contacted Symantec (Norton SystemsWorks Manufacture, they were not aware that they had this product on the market without ""Norton's Anti Virus as part of the product. BEWARE THAT THIS BASIC EDTION DOES NOT HAVE AN ANTI VIRUS INCLUDED WITH IT."
5,WOW,"I think this is a very well written book. It really encouraged me, and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Another John C. Maxwell Production,"Its a good book, but is very much like all of Maxwells work, repetitive verbal reinforcement. If you dont mind Maxwell's style you will like this book."
3,Leadership,This book goes in my library for counseling purposes. I am sure it will be an effective tool when needed.
4,It's okay.,"In high school I took a few business classes and my teacher handed this book out in order for everyone to get a basic idea of what a leader is. This book has examples and stories about various leaders. It's not that long or whatever, but it should be an interesting book if you're considering going into business and becoming a leader."
4,leadership basic.,I have to say that John Maxwell has the stuff. He writes clear and concise. This is a good start on any journey to learning how to be an effective leader.
5,Maxwell's silver book,"Maxwell has written a wonderful book. It is best read on a daily basis for inspirational ideas on leadership. When you have finished it, read it again. This was an excellent purchase."
1,Just can't get into it,"This book is written in a weird manner. I've only made it through Part I, and he toots his own horn for almost it's entirety. I bought this based on the reviews, and I am sorry that I did. Even at $10, it's not worth it. I am inherently skeptical of ""self-help"" books, and this does nothing to change that opinion.Skip it."
1,Fraudulent Author,"Without considering author John C. Maxwell's background, I found Leadership 101 to be informative and insightful. Filled with quotations and life stories of great leaders, Maxwell did a great a job piecing together a book of other people's accounts on the topic of leadership. However, I don't understand how an esteemed pastor could write a hundred pages on leadership without mentioning his own personal leader, or referring to the book he claims to believe. Perhaps the book hold more weight had it been written by a successful Fortune 500 business owner, instead of a pastor using his success in the Christian church to try to teach on corporate success."
2,Just OK,"This had too much about what results you need, but not enough how to get there for me. Not enough concrete steps to take now..."
2,Good luck trying to replace the batteries!!!,The screws on the back are SO cheap and SO tight that they totally strip out before you even get them to turn and you can replace the batteries! They are disposable toys!
3,It's alright...,"This item is alright, but it is kind of difficult to get it to fire each time you want it to, and the adjusting wrist straps are very irritating to try to loosen. If the product is too loose on your wrist, when you try to fire it, it doesn't work very well, but if you tighten it down where it needs to be, it is very difficult to get off when you're done."
1,Photo on box did not portray toy,"Do not buy this product! I spent $24.95 on this toy and the box shows two boys playing lazer tag which lights up red like a flash light. When we took it out of the box, there is a small red light on the top that flashes and makes a noise, but nothing like a red flash light as depicted on the front and back of the box. Not fun at all. I contacted WildPlanet and they could have cared less and told me to read the box."
2,Shame on Spy Gear - NO truth in advertising,"I usually buy most toys on Amazon, or on the rare occasion I don't, I check the Amazon reviews from my phone in the toy store. BUT I (foolishly) took a leap of faith and bought this at the store without reading these reviews.Let me tell you there was NO DOUBT in anyone's mind that there would be a red light streaming out of these puppies once you turned them on. Of course there would be...they've got pictures of the red lights all over the packaging. But NO, there is NO light. And it's not broken, that's just the way it works.Had I purchased these on Amazon (well I probably wouldn't have after reading the reviews) I would have had proper expectations. But making a purchase after looking at the real packaging in a real store, I feel totally mislead and lied to by Spy Gear.So shame on you, Spy Gear!And thank you, Amazon, for this great review system!And thank you, Amazon customers, for filling it up with (usually) valuable reviews!"
3,No Lazer,"I bought this toy for my 5 year old, and was very suprised to find out that it doesnt light up. I didn't think it would have a real lazer because of the low price. I did think it would have some sort of red flash or something visable. It only has sound. I still would have bought the toy knowing that but I would have made sure my son wasnt expecting it to light up the way the picture on the box did."
3,need good aim,"it is an okay toy,though it is hard to aim. my friend and ipretended like one of us was guarding a base, while one of ustried to shoot the guard. there is no lazer though. and it is hard to shoot."
4,Twist on Laser Tag,"My 5 yr old loved this toy. He didn't quite understand the concept of having to aim one laser at the other, so I tested it out with my brother. We noticed that the lasers didn't always register when you aimed them at each other, you had to aim pretty well. There isn't an actual laser shooting across the room, just a small light at the end, but that's typical. The straps were a little loose for our 4 and 5 yr olds, but that didn't stop them from playing. These things have been all over the house and at the bottom of the toy box and used off and on for months now and no new batteries, they still work just fine."
1,My reaction to this product,"According to the ones who received this, the toy does not really registerhits by either laser or infra red during play, but just beeps. I am going to have to purchase another laser tag toy for my grandson to replace this one. I am not very happy about it. If this was stated in the description, I did not catch it."
2,Not easy to use,The wrist strap is hard it was difficult to fasten on and off. My 6 year old grandson couldn't do it by himself. It was also way too big for him. He couldn't make it work unless he used his other hand.
1,Pretentious Nutcase,"Is this guy a pretentious nutcase, or what? After a successful career as a Broadway producer, which is to say, of middling entertainments, he derailed and decided he was Jesus of Broadway, out to save the world with such deathless ""dangerous"" art as the flaccid M Butterfly. He was finally dragged to where all go who have lost their way but are in need of a nice safe place with rubber walls, the academy. There, he can host all sorts of ""dangerous"" readings and workshops while congratulating himself on their failure out in the crass commercial world where what's truly dangerous is what's good, not what makes Stuart Ostrow feel good about himself. Skip this book; it is, like his other one, boring."
3,Robert Calvert - 'At The Queen Elizabeth Hall' (BGO),"This audio keepsake of the late Robert Calvert was recorded live on October 1, 1986 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. All semi-informed / new Hawkfans NEED to keep one thing in mind, this is strictly a solo effort by Calvert. Personally, I thought this import CD was decent. Just nothing to get all hyped up about. Tunes I liked best were ""Evil Rock"", ""Test Tube Conceived"" (great song, see my review of the CD), the sort of Gary Numan-ish ""All The Machines Are Quiet"", ""Telekinesis"" and the off-the-wall ""Lord Of The Hornets"". Liked Nik Turner's version better on his 'Past Or Future' disc."
1,Not as big in real lfe,This log would've been perfect for my snake if it wasn't smaller than it looks. I got it for my snake and got a large just be safe. The large ended up looking like a medium or a small and wouldn't fit my snake so I had to send it back. If you want it for a lizard or a baby snake then by all means it would be perfect for you.
5,A timeless classic that never grows old!,"I am one of those very lucky girls who happened to be up front at the Atlanta concert for this recording! And each time I play this I am taken back there again in time and place! ""Freebird"", ""Tuesday's Gone"", ""Gimme Three Steps"", ""Simple Man"", ""Crossroads"", ""Needle & Spoon"" - need I say more? There's nothing else on earth like Southern Rock - except maybe being there live! This is truly Skynyrd's best, for when you play this CD (I wore out 2 LP's YEARS ago), the sun comes out and the days are HOT!! Just like LYNYRD SKYNYRD!"
2,Where's Travelin Man,"I am not happy it is missing two or three songs fromthe LP, and it did not say this before it was bought."
2,A flat live perfomance from a great studio band,"I don't want to insult anybody, but I bought this CD based on the other reviews here, and I was dissappointed. Granted, I am not a hard core fan of L.S. I like their music, but I think they may be better in the studio. The production values were poor, the sound muddy, and I thought the studio versions of almost every song was better than the live. I rented their video ""Free Bird"", and found the story inspiring, especially since this is a band that has a message of living responsibly together with pride of their southern heritage. So although I love the band and am greived by what has happened to them, I can't recommend this CD. I liked their ""Endangered Species"", a recent accoustic releases, a lot more."
3,Tight!,"This boot is really cute, but they are really tight. I have thin legs and could hardly zip them up."
4,St. Dominic a Likeable Character,"I like St. Dominic and the Rosary because it highlights the major events in St. Dominic's life in a way that is colorful and interesting. Incidents described in the book, whether about St. Dominic being accosted by bandits eager to murder him or his attempt to move a picture that would return to its place, are not covered in a dry historical manner but in a lively fashion which make for it being a page-turner book. Altogether, the book is a delightful one to read and I recommend it to anyone wanting to get better acquainted with St. Dominic's character."
1,"Love Shopaholic Series, but...I am not amused...","that this is the SAME book, then entitled Confessions of a Shopaholic, that started the whole series--just re-published in 2012 with a different title. This is a disingenuous move by the author and publisher, and tricks the reader (read some of the other reviews) into thinking that Sophie Kinsella has written a NEW book for the widely popular series. I'd rate less than 1 star if I could. Bad form!"
3,The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic,"Book arrived before quoted time. The book is the same as ""Confession of a Shopaholic""! Wished I would have known that and I wouldn't have two of the same book but with different title. After a while, it gets frustrating to know this person is real! There are many women out there like this! Started reading the series but after the second book ~ I don't want to know Becky anymore ~ she needs help, grow up and become a responsible human being!"
2,She's... So... ANNOYING!,"I really tried to sympathize with her. I really did.But I hate the main character so much! I thought ""you know, I understand her reasoning, I've done the same thing on my crazy shopping sprees too, etc etc."" But the main character is beyond ridiculous. She's not even reasonable, it's like listening to a retard. I'm struggling to finish - Urgh."
3,Not the house favorite...,"These florentines are not the house favorite, for some reason. They love the souffles' and basically, most of the rest of them but these florentines, well, I can put them in the mix about once a month and that's all they'll eat them. Don't know why - they like most of the other Fancy Feast varieties. I think maybe they may be a little too upper class for my Persians! I do recommend them though because of their high nutritional value and more natural contents."
1,Bigotry does not cure bigotry,"This book was given to me as a gift. I agree that people have used the excuse of God to justify abuse throughout history. That being said, this book's thesis couldn't have been put forth with less vitriol or in a less objective way.If your aim is to open a practicing christian's mind, this would be the absolute worst book to suggest to them.This book is aimed at at bigots who need their beliefs reiterated & reinforced."
5,It's about time,"This is a wonderful book. I'm glad it is finally out. All of the religious intolerance of the early church is brought to light. The facts should not be used as a reason to hate the church; but, they help us all understand that claims of a divine right to speak for God are all false. If you liked this book , I would also recommend the book An Encounter With A Prophet. The author of An Encounter With A Prophet would no doubt be burned at the stake if organized religion still had the power it had in the middle ages."
5,Debunking Christian Myths,I'm in favor of any book that debunks Christian Myths. This book was well written and informative. I particularly appreciated the author's take on the antiquated belief that we need to fear God. If you enjoyed this book you might also wish to read An Encounter with a Prophet by Clyde A. Lewis
4,the dark side of christian history,"interesting info for anyone, but if you call yourself ""Christian"", it is a must read"
3,dark side of religion,"I ordered this particular title for my son, who qestions everything religiuos & apparently he really liked it!!"
3,not much here,"while this book occasionally does a good job of exposing the evils of the church, its overall very glossed-over and general. plus the author tries to link the orthodox christian church with modern science and condemns them both together, as if they were at all the same. the last chapter is basically her saying that modern science cannot explain the earth, that nature has consciousness, and that rational thought doesn't explain things very well. this is ridiculous and unfounded, which then causes the reader to question anything the author said, and if this was your sole source of enquiry this might negate some useful information."
2,OK but could have been better.,A book of this type is needed but as I read it I kept wishing that the scholarship was better and the treatment more thoughtful.
4,Good,"The review underneath possesses some valid critique but is slightly overly critical. This book is well written and informative. The chapters don't end with the same intensity as the opening, actually, it's somewhat inverse. Still, there's enough in here to make even the most staunch Christian question his religion and his belief system. I do recommend however, that in order to get the maximum effect of this book, one must be a little bit of a historian as well."
5,Excellent.,"I am amazed that stories told in this book were never told to me before now. Some of these stories like the council and nicea, directed by Constantine, the way Constantine has his son killed and wife boiled alive I had never heard. These stories are basic past of life on planet earth and yet kept secret. This book is like a forgotten text book, filled with accurate data that is part of a basic, simple education that describes the past. Another example, of this is the example given of the basic relation between reproductive celebrations in spring that Christian humans changed and called ""Easter"" with a rabbit and egg, both symbols of reproduction.I hate 999 of 1000 books, this book I like.I ask Helen Ellerbe and other humans to search for my name on the internet. I got this book in a beautiful library in Newport Beach, California, and now I think I want to buy a copy for me, and for the human that owned the ovum I grew from.Thanks Ted Huntington"
4,good build,"a pleasant way for children to retell ""The Story"" to themselves while enjoying the craft of assembly and having achieved something practical."
3,"Good, but not worth the price","This is a good cookie mix, but considering the $9 price tag, they skimped on the chocolate chunks. I had to add more. The cookies baked reasonably nicely and tasted good, but are only a little above average. If you want a really delicious cookie mix, try Jacques Torres' mudslide cookies."
3,Not great,"Too expensive for the taste. It was your average cookie, not much else going on to justify the price. Stick to the regular supermarket brand."
5,A must read!,A great little book. Wonderful for kids. My grandkids loved it. My mom even liked it. Great for group reading. Interesting and funny. Great details. Have read it again and again.
4,They said the product was in stock....,They told me this product was in stock. My son is deployed and requested these for his use there. If I had known they were not really available I would have bought them elsewhere given the importance.
1,Evil,"This oil is ok. It's runny and spreads around easy. Seepage is good for trigger parts, but anywhere else it makes a runny mess. It will seep into unwanted places if you have some in your gun and leave it in one position for a long time. And once the oil has moved, the formerly oiled parts are not lubed but tacky instead. The worst though is the bottle. I've had multiple bottles crack at the neck and leak oil everywhere. It's so frustrating, and I don't have anything else to put the oil in. Pay slightly more and get a bottle that will not leak. Don't buy this nightmare."
2,Overpriced mineral oil,"There's no question that it works. That said, the freely-available Material Data Safety Sheet lists only one ingredient: ""White Mineral Oil."" For that, they charge over two bucks an ounce. You can find mineral oil by the gallon for much, much less money. (Or, if you want your rifle to smell pretty, try baby oil. Still the same thing.) Refined petroleum distillates are the same no matter what bottle they come in; Hoppe's may mix a fine solvent, but their oil is no better than anyone else's."
3,great oil,Paid way to much for it found it at Wall-mart for a 1/3 of the price of amazon next time I'll go to Wallmart.
4,as advertised,works fine and as advertised. I wonder if it leaks so i put it in a bag for protection. very good.
5,Good oil,"I personally use this oil to keep a thin layer on my knives and bayonets with carbon steel blades to prevent any rust or corrosion and it does its job well. If my fishing reel needs lubricating in the spring, I wouldn't hesitate to use it for that either. It's not extremely greasy and coats with a nice thin layer just as I like. Buy it if you need a good oil for something I described, it'll do the job!"
5,Hoppe's Oil,"Got it on the recommendation of a relative. Works very well, although I have nothing to compare it to. Would buy again."
3,Good but not great,This book is the least exciting from the taller de guion collection. Not much to see here if you've already read the other two books (which i definitely recommend if you haven't already read them).
3,A good toy,"The toy is adorable , it taught my 4 month old to recognize twinkle twinkle little star. But it came strapped down with plastic bands that have left holes and the filling keeps coming out besides this one problem it's perfect it helps me put my son to bed."
3,Not Very Exciting,"I bought this toy for my 8 month old son, who loves the Baby Einstein videos. He has not been very interested in this toy at all. The puppet is difficult to manipulate, and it only sings one song. The 'bonus' DVD, is actually a mini DVD, so it cannot be played on a regular DVD player."
3,Conan strikes again,"Inspector Conan, the ace detective trapped within the body of a first-grader, solves more difficult cases. Constrained by the necessity of maintaining the illusion that he is nothing more than an unusually intelligent child, he usually explains his solution to the case by tranquilizing his guardian, Detective Mori, and simulating his voice. Why doesn't anyone think it strange that they are being addressed by a slumped figure with eyes closed and lips unmoving? If logical lapses like this bother you, then avoid this series."
3,A tough read,"This is one of those books where you have to read a paragraph again and again to actually get what it's saying. It's got great topics, if you can sift through the words! I don't love the writing style."
5,Basic & Clinical Pharmacology,"While most of my students would not find this excellent work ""basic"", it is an outstanding adjunct to any healthcare professional's library. The chapters are well structured and the information is up to date. The illustrations have improved over the years and are mated well with the text.In all, this is a worthwhile text for anyone studying pharmacology or a useful resource."
4,WELL WORTH THE PRICE,"The ""Basic & Clinical Pharmacology"" may not be the most comprehensive and the most detailed single-volume text available on Pharmacology, but it has a lot of positive attributes. It is straightforward, well-illustrated, and ranks among the lowest-priced voluminous books that contains all the essentials a clinical student or doctor may need."
4,Excellent overall text,"A really thorough, excellent pharmacology text for the advanced student. At times the book lacks flow, and the student taking pharmacology for the first time may want to also purchase a quick pocket guide briefly describing the classes of meds."
3,It's Okay,Took longer to receive than anticipated. They appear dried out so not as good as I was hoping for but work for my needs
1,Not good!,Purchased these for my elderly father for doing his personal cares. The plastic lid never stays on and you can not flush these. For an older person this is not a good thing!
1,WHOLE SEASON,"The only thing I regret is the fact that I could not purchase the whole season, I could only purchase 1 episode at a time, therefore it would have taken a while just to purchase all 15 episodes, so therefore I only purchased the one's I thought I would enjoy."
1,Not satisfied,The DVD set did not come with all the CDs. It was supposed to be a 3 disc set. Instead it only came with two. Most likely will not buy DVDs from this site again!
5,Boondocks Rule!!!.,I'm a major fan of the comic strip as well as the first season. Having this second season to add to my collection was well worth it and looking forward to owning the third season next. Great animation and storytelling as well as comical.
5,The Boondocks Season 2,"This season is hilarious! Especially this episode. I didn't get the ""What's gotten into you?"" joke until I was watching it while I was supposed to be studying. Hilarity ensued. This is definitely one of the funniest episodes."
4,Very good series,Disappointed there was no season three.This series is a behind closed doors real look at ourselves as human beings. Some things secretly acknowledeged but never revealled.
5,Boondocks does it again!!!,"Once again the Boondocks have amazed me with the issues they address in it's animated comedy series. It's a must but for all who enjoyed season 1. If you have never seen the Boondocks, please purchase season 1 before purchasing season 2. There are season 1 continuation episodes in season 2. Regina King is amazing! How she can pull off the voices of the two main characters is truly amazing! Looking forward to season 3."
5,Boondocks Season 2,"The Boondocks Season 2 is a great addition to the home of any true fan of the critically acclaimed series on Adult Swim. It includes the 2 controversial BET episodes that were not aired in the United States. Each episode is packed with satire, action, and hilarity. I was hoping the special features would include deleted scenes or additional clips of the series like the first season DVD set. However, this is a minor issue and the extras are quite enjoyable. I'm in deep anticipation for the next season."
5,Hell Ya!!! IT's hilarious!!!!!,"I could not stop laughing from beginning to end. The writing and voice acting is great. The best episode is the famous banned ""BET Episode"". I'm not going to say much but it's hilarious. The video also shows the making of an episode and interview with the creator that is worth wild. If you love great comedy and animation get the Boondocks!!!!!"
4,"VERY GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SEASON 1","This is hilarious! The BET segments were a little over the top, but I really enjoyed the rest. Riley and Granddad are funny as ever. However, I liked Season 1 a little better."
5,"One of the most funny series, ever.","The second season started off a little bit slow until we got to the return of Stinkmeiner. Then, we knew, Boondocks was back.This DVD set is well worth it because it contains two episodes never aired by Cartoon Network: The Uncle Ruckus reality show, which is a classic and incredibly hilarious, and the BET episode, which was just alright.I'd highly recommend this purchase for any Boondocks fan, or anyone who wants a good dose of comedy."
5,Da best,"The Boondocks is a very funny series. I have no problem telling anyone else to buy this product. The only thing it is too short, not enough epodies."
1,Good but.....,"Every Lucy Stone book I read, 10 books already, I found lots of typos.Sometimes I saw characters names where they are not even included in the scene. Her husband Bill's name was mentioned when Lucy and the cops stop the murderer. I see Bill's name as if he was standing there and then poof, he's gone. In one book, he's even called Bob. It blows my concentration if a sentence doesn't make sense. Who can you complain to about typos in every book? I wouldn't be surprised if I find errors in the last two books. I liked almost every story but give it no stars for the errors."
1,Wrong item sent (Second time now),"Correct product did not arrive (Conditioner), but their Cleaner product did. Paid for the Conditioner, but got the less expensive Cleaner. This is their second mistake in sending the wrong product. First time I kept the Cleaner, but this time I have asked to return it. Could not believe they messed up twice now on a simple order and wonder who actually fills them at the manufacture plant? I will no longer purchase from them again unless they can take care of the mistakes."
2,disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My daughter LOVES her Lite Brite but this set of refill pages is very disappointing. Since it is designed to fit all of the lite brite sizes, the pictures are printed on both sides of the paper with the intent that you are to cut according to your size toy. The idea is clever, but since the printing is on both sides of the paper, the back side shows through onto the front when you place it one the screen. This was VERY frustrating to my daughter. Now I know better to look for refills designed just for the cube and no other sizes."
1,Nasty words included in SONG!!!!!!,I purchased this single for my 10 year old daughter because I did not see any disclaimer advising me that the tracks had nasty words in them. I am aware that Green Day does cuss so I when I went on line to order this item I thought I had taken all the necessary precautions to ensure that I did not purchase the nasty version of the songs. Needless to one of the songs uses a word that should NOT be allowed on any music. I hope Amazon will make it easier for parents like me to order music on line that does NOT contain cuss words. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
2,Way to basic,"If you are a fantasy guru, and have been studying and reading fantasy books for most of your life... don't bother with this book. It's main intent is geared towards people who have very little experience with fantasy. I found this book to be pretty useless."
2,Mediocre,"The two best things about this book are the title and the cover artwork. This book is exceptional only in its mediocrity. Anyone who has read much fantasy and/or played fantasy role-playing games will find this book somewhat unhelpful. The contents deal mostly with medieval customs and clothing, as well as modern witchcraft. If, however, you know next to nothing about fantasy writing and would like to try writing it, this would be a reasonable book among others to buy...though I can't imagine why someone in such a situation would attempt to write fantasy in the first place."
3,Not all its cracked up to be,"First off, this book is in no way complete. It is sort of a basic introduction to many different aspects of fantasy. This book provides a lot of information but none of it is in depth. You can best think of the book as the Writer's Jack-of-All-Trades fantasy reference book: it gives you a little bit of knowledge in a lot of things but delves deeply into nothing.If you really dont know much about mythologies, etc. This book is good. but you can get all this information and more for free and with registering and HTTP://WWW.PANTEON.ORG , aka ""the Encyclopedia Mythica""."
3,"A book of ideas, not concrete information","THIS IS NOT THE BOOK YOU MIGHT WANT TO CITE FOR YOUR MYTHOLOGY TERM PAPER. I does not have the accurate, or the complete information on any of the subjects contained. It does a horrible job at citing its sources, and for that it should be hated. Likewise, nowhere in the book does it say that accuracy is what the authors aimed for in the first place. It provides more that a few interesting, intriguing, and not-too-cliche ideas for writers, worldbuilders, and the like. Just don't say that you got the most accurate info around."
2,Uninspired and stereotypical,"The book, while written in an entretaining way, lacks substance. Full of the classic stereotypes of the genre, which are just assumed instead of though about, it's barely more that a high school level revision of medieval europe because, supposedly, all fantasy happens in europe. Granted, it has a few words to say about some five other cultures, but too sketchy to be interesting. On the other hand if you're looking for names for castle parts, armor, or medieval clothing, this is the book for you."
3,A very basic and decent resource,"I will say right off the bat that this book is not for fantasy writers who consider themselves in any way experienced. It is well-written and interesting enough, but all of the information can be found very easily in other, much more detailed books and some of the information provided is something that most serious fantasy writers will find that they already knew to a point.That being said, the author has a good idea, and I do have it on my self for an occasional look-through...you never know what will inspire, after all. There is nothing wrong with this book, it is nice for what it is, but I really think that anyone buying it because they think it will vastly improve their writing will be left disappointed.Buy it for a very basic reference book, and realize that you will have to do much more of your own research...as you should, anyway. This book can help point you in the right direction, certainly, but it can't do much more then point."
1,Incomplete and dispensable,"The greatest lack of this book is the lack of recommended reading. I don't mean fantasy recommendations I mean reference works where more details can be found on the subjects presented. Parts of this book are an overview of famous fantasy worlds, parts of it are simple dictionary like lists of occupations, clothes, weapons, animals and so on."
3,Missing some information,"This has some great information on Medieval society, mythology, and many other topics. I did get some ideas while reading it.BUT it needed more information on the things fantasy writers often get wrong. For example, it could have used a whole chapter on HORSES. We all know writers often get the facts about horses wrong. (As Diane Wynn Jones mentioned in ""The Tough Guide to Fantasyland,"" some fantasy writers treat horses like bicycles.) More information about sieges, Medieval villages, wilderness survival tips, and so forth would have been nice, too. (How often have you read a fantasy novel where characters who are supposed to be hiding from their enemies light a huge campfire?)This book also needs a detailed bibliography"
2,This is an incomplete book.,"I thought this book would cover ALL FANTASY topics as in creatures that could be within your novel. This book is more like a history lesson about castles, the dress that one would wear in a castle, what the people would be back then. And when we do get to the creatures it is like just throw in some of the basic creatures that one would see in a fantasy novel like a unicorn to a pegagus, nothing about how to create your own different creature or at least a suggestion on how to create your own.I found it lacking in a lot of things. If I had known that it just contained the basic information, I would not have purchased this book but looked for another book that is more worthy of being in my reference library. I like it for the basic information if you are a beginner in writing fantasy novels, but this book is totally incomplete."
5,End of Watch,"This is an excellent book. It is well written and researched. From the first story to the last it will hold your interest and leave you wanting to read ""just one more"" story."
4,Solid album from the mid-50's,"This is an unassuming, swinging CD featuring the warm, deep, single-note playing of guitarist Herb Ellis. Joining Herb are trumpeter Sweets Edison, multi-reed man Jimmy Giuffre, alto saxophonist Charlie Mariano (4 sides only) and the rhythm section of Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown, and Alvin Stoller. The proceedings kick off with a nice up-tempo blues (SWEETHEART BLUES) that has an excellent Edison muted solo. Giuffre is spotlighted well on SOMEBODY LOVES ME on tenor and POGO on baritone sax. On the title track the rhythm section drops out during Giuffre's clarinet solo to good effect. Ellis is a delightful player, melodic and relaxed. Though not qualifying as a must-have CD, these mid-`50s sides are solid, swinging, and appealing, and will not disappoint."
5,Lost Masterpiece,"Jesse was the last Frankie Stubbs vehicle prior to Leatherface reforming some years ago. This album, originally released in 1998, features an amazing roster of songs that sound as if they should have been the follow up album to Leatherface's swan song, ""The Last,"" in place of the so-so Pope album. Or It could easily be seen as the ominous sound of the group's reintroduction that came with the release of their split release with Hot Water Music. Often invoking the sorrowful tone and mesmerizing power of classic songs like ""In My Life,"" ""Not Superstitious,"" and ""Don't Work"" the Jesse album is packed with classics such as ""Rant"" that will have any Leatherface fan stunned that the album has yet to be properly reissued and made available. This is the lost Stubbs masterpiece that no true fan can live without."
5,Intelligent math-rock from Upstate NY,"I love this album. The songs are catchy, smart, and straight to the point. Produced by J. Robbins of Burning Airlines and Jawbox. Heavy, melodic, math-y, fun."
4,Perfect read for beginners.,"Briefly covers Russian history from the Rurikids to the Putin years, easy to read and contains all the important themes of an incredible history. If you have any interest in Russia and it's history, then this is the perfect book to wet your appetite and get you hungry for more!"
4,Concise!,"If you want a concise and well written primer on Russian history, this is the book for you. Ascher provides a pleasant overview of major developments and figures in Russian history, plus he's careful not to fall into subjective assessments, which is now all too common in English language Russian history books."
4,Solid overview of Russia,"Ascher's ""Russia: A Short History"" is a great choice to get acquainted with Russian history. I didn't know much of Russia's story except as it relates to the World Wars and the Cold War. This book provides a masterful overview of the Russian state from it's inception till Vladimir Putin's government. The text is entertaining and easy to read. Ascher does a good job of providing sufficient detail without overloading the reader's brain."
2,Not very modern,"Bought this for xmas for my 4 yr old son. He likes the toy but I'm disappointed with the quality. The audio is very old-fashioned, sounds like Max Headroom. Plus every dinosaur makes the same screeching sound, there is no variety to the different species as you would expect. My son actually brought this to my attention. ""Mom,"" he said, ""why do the t-rex and the diplodicus have the same voice?"" Good question, kiddo. I wouldn't recommend this if your child really loves dinos, they'll spot the problems."
4,educational,"this was purchased for a 5 year old and he loved it..he has learned the names of the dino's and many facts about them. the only issue is that the ""voice"" is somewhat bizarre and accented so you do have to listen carefully to pick out all the spoken words. a good educational toy"
5,Your child will love it if they love dinosaurs,"My son got this toy for his birthday when he turned 4. He is almost 5, and loves it more every day! He can sit for a long time and play with this. He knows so many of the facts about the dinosaurs, and quizzes us! He also is learning how to answer true and false questions because of this toy."
4,T REX,Bought this for my grandson (4 years old). He love it and had it figured out way before I did. Very good buy.
2,electronics are terrible,I gave this to my nephew last year for christmas but the same day he opened it it wouldn't work. we had to play some felt pads where the batter is so that it would stay snug in there needless to say it worked periodically. Terrible buy for how much money they want for it!
5,Hospice Care,"When Autumn Comes provides valuable insight into the profoundly compassionate work of a hospice volunteer. Bennett's heartfelt stories of companionship with the dying will touch and inspire all who open their hearts to her message. A well-written and moving book.Cheryl MacDonald, Compassionate Care Facilitator for Faith Community"
2,"Love Baby SuperMall, but this light is junk","I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product. I ordered this and the Zanzibar lamp from Baby SuperMall to go in my baby's room. The lamp is gorgeous and matches the rest of the room perfectly. This night light is very cheap looking, cartoonish, the colors are faded and washed out when not lit, and almost disappear when lit. I bought it with a gift certificate, and since I need a night light in there I'm going to keep it. But it's really not worth $15 - save your money and buy one of the other Zanzibar items and get a plain ol' cheap night light from Wal-Mart or Target.The Baby SuperMall folks are very proactive, give great customer service, and my orders shipped very quickly - I will definitely buy from them again in the future!"
2,Good but only horizontal,The light is ok but the problem is that it will only plug into horizontal outlets. All outlets in the house are vertical (one prong on top of the other) and the light will be laying on its side.They should change the design 90 degrees or even better have it rotatable.
5,A Baker's Must Have Item,"There isn't a lot that I can say about this coupler but it is a handy item to have if you are planning on switching tips on your pastry bag. I recently bought a set of large Ateco tips for working with eclairs and macaroons. I needed a large coupler so that I could switch tips. This coupler fit the bill precisely. It has sturdy, quality construction and is large enough that you can easily clean it out. Couplers are one of those culinary equipment afterthoughts. They are easy enough to overlook, but they are indispensible. Give this coupler a try with your large tips. You'll be satisfied."
5,"great product, as described","Great product, as described, no complaints. Easy to use, easy to wash. Great quality and has held up to many uses."
4,Historical context helps to explain book's premise,"Many thought-provoking points are raised in Phillip Jenkin's book which make it an interesting read.Much of today's negative opinion of Catholism (documented in The New Anti-Catholism) is the result of the scientific revolution and goes back to Galileo's trial and the issues debated in his 1633 trial, at the hands of the Inquisition. The trial ushered in a scientific mindset that everything scientific was good and true, and that all things religious, ie Catholic, were evil and bereft of reason.How this shift in world perspective happened and why is examined in a recent book by Wade Rowland called Galileo's Mistake. Rowland contends that the clash between Galileo and the Church was not about Copernicus or astronomy or science, but whether science provides the only pathway to truth. Galileo's Mistake gives the historical context and reasons that explain Philip Jenkins' premise in The New Anti-Catholicism."
5,Insightful look at a recurring prejudice,"This book is very helpful in detailing the way that anti-Catholicism has become acceptable in our society, especially in certain segments of the media. In addition to the book I heard a talk by Professor Jenkins and he goes back to colonial American to show the anti-Catholicism that was even put in primers."
1,A very silly book,"I am a Catholic, I have been a Catholic since my baptismat two days of age. Phillip Jenkin's book is just anotherattempt by a scribbling Britt to make money and gain fame (of a sort) in the American neo-conservative river of money.The most serious anti-Catholic manifestations in the United States are, as they have always been, contained in the conservative protestant evangelical movement. If you doubt this listen to their radio programs, go into their book stores and look for quotes by their leaders. For Jenkins to ignore this flood of anti-Catholic hatred to make a case that liberals (including a number of actual Catholics) are the source of scorn and hatred of the Catholic church and Catholics is dishonest.To see real anti-Catholic diatribes you should try to find what people such as Jean Kirkpatrick and Al Haig said about the Church women murdered in El Salvador.Jenkins is just another neo-con on the make."
3,Not Bad,"I've only ever used the Target-brand for cosmetic pads, which I have no complaints about, so I'm comparing this product to that. The Iris cosmetic pads are very soft, except that they shed little tufts of cotton on my face (which the Target-brand pads do not). So, they work fine, but it's annoying to have to brush off the left-behind cotton, especially if I forgot to do it immediately after using the pad and then put lotion or make-up on."
2,Paint peeling,"Fountain is nice looking & works alright but the paint that that put on is not sticking, It is peeling everywhere. Not sure how I'm going to fix the problem."
1,Fragile,"I used this case for about 3 months. One day my phone rang and I reached for it (attached to by belt by the included clip). It came off far to easy. The button broke off in the holster. I contacted the seller by e-mail, and I was told. "" If you still have the button you may be able to glue it back on with super glue."" I would not purchase this item again, nor would I recommend it to a friend.Sydney Harbour LG AX-4270 Lambskin Leather Case / Holster - Premium"
4,Nice introduction,I read this book as part of a Sports and Entertainment law class taught by the author. Mr. Jones can certainly back up his knowledge of Sports and Entertainment law in the classroom and has a genuine affinity for sports. The book served as an excellent guide. It is notable that some areas need updating but an excellent all around book that is written well for the lay person.
3,Serfas Excerciser Bicycle Saddle,"My daughter had a hip surgery and needed to perform bicycle excersice. The seat that came with the bicycle was not soft enough, so we ordered this one.It was not much better. The softness was not soft enough. We returned the item.There is nothing wrong with it just that we needed very soft seat!"
1,simply useless,"Expecting a book about John Denver and his interests, I received a dismal collection of unimportant personal recollections, some of which hardly had anything to do with John. The book also contains a dreadful story about its coming into existence: apparently the author sort of received the 'poems' (which are just as bad as the rest of the book) by some kind of miraculous dictation. The author says the purpose of the book is to honour John and to support the causes he was interested in- I think he will hardly be honoured by such a bad piece of work. Readers- if you want to support John, support Windstar, Cousteau etc but do not even think or ordering this book!"
3,"good, inexpensive cleat","These shoes aren't super comfortable, but they aren't UNcomfortable. I only wear them for about an hour at a time for adult intramurals, so they are perfect for that purpose. The red color is fun and they get the job done. For the price, they're great."
2,Many guitars missing,"Many less known brands and many models of well known brands (Aria, Ibanez, etc.) are not even mentioned. Some prices are wildly inaccurate (current models that can be checked). I take all they say with a grain of salt. It may or may not be true."
5,Very erotic music,"This is a fantastic CD to use during lovemaking.There is a rhythm present that, well, is very suggestive, sensual and ""rhythmic"".I would suggest it to anyone as a wonderful addition to their bedside music library."
5,Great for Lovers,"I never knew that something like this existed, but thought I would give it a try. Wow! This album just puts you in another realm of sensuality, wish I had it before. If you want to put some passion in your relationship, try this and let it carry you to another level. Love it!"
2,Too Short - Four Tracks Of Same - Poor Value - Over Priced,The music is of acceptable quality. But there is no variety. CD only has four short tracks of the SAME music. Way over priced for no more than New World placed on this CD. You may want to look elsewhere for better variety and value.
5,simply beautiful,"This is not a new piece of music, but it is timeless. I think this is the most sensuous, romantic, tantric music, I have ever heard. I am a huge ""Enigma"" fan, and rank this right up there with that sound. It is 4 tracks, but the way they are put together, they seamlessly and gracefuly flow one into the other. This CD is so worth having. I love to go to sleep listening to it. Beautiful timeless, and even for those that don't think they like ""new age"" music, give it a listen, I think you will change your mind."
3,Sound Quality is not there!,"I bought a pair of Amphony 2500 headphones in December of 2004. These headphones are great. I still have them. Sound quality is as good as any wired Sennheiser phone I've heard, and they are very comfortable. I recently decided to purchase a 2nd pair for my home theater system. However, when I received the new phones I was extremely disappointed. The frequency response of the new phone is not nearly as good as my old one. The highs are gone, and they sound muddy. I returned them and got another pair, but had the same issue. The quality of construction and materials has also diminished. I noticed that manufacturing has moved to China. That may explain the difference."
5,"Outstanding, insightful photos","Stoecklein's use of shading and shadow in his photography in this book really capture the Montana spirit. My wife, a born and bread Montana gal, really loved this book. She was really moved by some of the pictures. This is really a great book for the die-hard Montana resident (and you know who you are...) and anyone who likes the spirit of the northwest."
1,Don't waste your money,You are better off with an over the counter sleep aid. Their best product is Quick Defense
5,Today's Harriet Tubman,"I am yet to read this book, but I have listened to Ms. Parker speak on Dr. Dobsons radio program, and let me tell you something, this is one sharp Christian American! Ms. Parker has wisdom, and is a true woman of God. Liberals will most likely hate this book but that is exactly why we should buy it....If a liberal hates it, it must be good! People do not need big government, they need Jesus Christ. If we put our trust into Him, all things will fall into place. Ms. Parker believes this Truth, and that is why she is no longer a slave of Uncle Sam's Plantation."
5,Very good,A well written and thoughtful presentation by someone that has lived thru the situations that are causing our moral decline and gives her opinion on how we need to fix it politically.She could be my choice for a U.S. State Senator.
4,Uncle Sam's Plantation,Star Parker does a great job detailing how the government's welfare programs hurts rather than helps poverty. Her story is powerful because she has experienced 1st hand the negative impact of these programs have had on her life. The most powerful impact was how easy is to slip into dependency on the government. She details the resistance she had to overcome in order to become independent.
5,An eye opener...unless you chose to be blind.,Excellent. Her life story speaks volumes regarding our system to keep people from becoming self sufficient. I encourage anyone who can read to read.it and if you know someone who can't read....read it to them!
4,Enjoyable and Informative,"The book is an eye-opener and rings true with versimilitude. I did find one factual mistake in it that I just wanted to bring to people's attention: No doctors in the Tuskegee Syphilis study ever infected a patient with syphilis. Rather, they withheld treatment when treatment became available and did not give the patients informed consent. When Nixon heard the trial was still going on, he had it shut down at once. If anyone is teaching a course on welfare policy, I would recommend this book for one of the readings."
5,Uncle Sam,Star Parker did an outstanding job of articulating what is wrong with the system of welfare and aid given in this country. Regardless of what side your on regarding what to do about helping the poor this book is a must read!
1,Are these reviews for real?,"I was trying to make up my mind about purchasing this book but can't very well trust the reviews. I mean someone who hasn't even read it gave it 5 stars. Also, after some negative reviews there was a flood of reviews in the 4-5 star range. It makes it appear as if some people are trying to skew the results. It really makes you question how good a read it is."
4,The Rising Star!,I watched and listened to Star Parker on CSPAN as she addressed the Claire Booth Luce Foundation and was really taken by her remarks so much so that I decided to read this book. It's amazing how our government can't seem to reckon that these programs invented to help the poor and disadvantaged manage to keep them that way. I'm not sure what the solution is and if Ms. Parker's ideas of taking the government's role away and putting it in the hands of non-profits is a good remedy either. She has a very strong faith and she emphasizes this over and over in the book often becoming exasperated with the notion of the government's absolute forbidding of any religion entering into the implementation of programs to help the poor. Her strongest message involves instilling values and morality instead of political correctness in the schools and making people more accountable for their behaviors. It seems like perfect sense to me!
1,disappointed,"I hate to give a bad review but I could not get through this book. I think I made it through the first 2 chapters before I left it in the airport for someone else who might enjoy it more than I did. It's not that it wasn't well-written, it was just not what I wanted to be a part of really. I am conservative but this book seemed very closed-minded and I decided not to continue reading it."
1,Yaaawwwwnnnn,"Yet another waste of paper from Ms. Parker. She has nothing new to say except that many poor people are lazy. I think we know that since there are lazy, dishonest people in all classes of society. Also, unless you went back in time Ms. Parker, spare me the plantation analogies. Their is nothing in modern day America that comes close to the horrors of plantation slavery. The title is an insult to the sufferings our of black ancestors."
3,Still don't understand,I have used several beginning alphabet programs with my 7 year old. I was looking for something new for my 4 year old and this was well reviewed. I find it totally incomprehensible. It was somewhat entertaining for the 7 year old. We kept trying to guess which letter was represented on the screen. It was useless for letter recognition or phonic sound.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"My child accidentally bought this by clicking on the button to buy automatically while she was in my lap. I could have returned it, but decided to save it until she was ready. Well I just opened the package and tried it. This program is awful! Just like other reviewers, I couldn't figure it out and didn't really want to because it was just nonsense. I had to write a review because it is sooo terrible, I don't want anyone else to think their kids will learn anything from it. Do not waste your money."
3,Mostly okay,"The choice of music on this collection is excellent. While there are a few gems, many of the added rhythms seem a bit random and arbitrary, having little to do with the spirit of the original. Two excellent tracks are ""Ain't No Sunshine"" by Al Jarreau and the stripper beats of Marilyn Monroe's ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend."" In general, however, the rhythms tend to be too simplistic, like presets on a Casio keyboard. I'm a fan of chill'n' jazz, and for those of similar taste, I suggest any of the four volumes of ""Jazz Lounge."" Other great sets are ""Nu Jazz Sessions"" (Groove Gravy) and ""(re:mix)"" by re:jazz (Kriztal Records). Another great set is ""Jazzelicious Presents"" (also Kriztal Records). In fact much of the Kriztal Records catalog of is worthy listening. Check them out before buying this set."
5,Good Product,"This filter works well to reduce the amount of dust in a room. It can be tapped out periodically, depending on conditions, to extend its life and keep it working well. I would check it weekly."
4,"The ""aftermarket"" alternative to Harley's service manual","Folks who are serious about their HD motorcycles understand that there are a whole lot of companies making the same parts Harley makes - only a little different - sometimes better. Clymer's manual fits that category. It expands on the format of the standard Harley-Davidson service manual by including far more illustrations, troubleshooting tips and parts diagarams.The only area that requires improvement is the ""wiring diagrams"" section. If you're buying this to sort out an electrical problem - you might be happier with the factory manual. This appears to be a result of the books smaller format. The diagrams are smaller and the letters used to identify wire colors are all but illegible (on my copy anyway).Still, if your serious about doing your own ""wrenching"" this will be a worthwhile addition to your reference library."
1,looks nice.........but,"Very nice looking piece of equipment, however its positvie atributes stop there. First, it was not calibrated correctly and had to take it apart to reset. It seemed to be fairly accurate, but could not be sure, as it it always varied from the local tempature announcements. Then we had our first warm day when the tempature got about 70, and this registered close to 100. Nice looking.........."
1,junk,"Not brass but some other type of metal painted to look like brass. Glass is loose and I am concerned that if mounted outside and exposed to moisture, product will degrade"
1,Was great for about three months,"I put this on the outside of my house. After about three months, it froze on the same temperature. It's not a rusty piece of junk."
1,Never Worked Properly,The thermometer has read '72' since the first week I installed it outside my appartment window. (The same temperature shown in the product photo.)
3,Its OK,"I like the product a lot but the base rusted after a single winter in VA. I guess I was an idiot but I thought it should be weather proof. We used it a lot but when we moved after a year, we left it at the house."
1,Another Chinese product.,"Bought four Chaney 3-1/2 inch brass swivel thermometers . One for myself and three for gifts. The one I installed on my porch,in the shade, indicated the temperature to be 10 degrees higher than it actually was.Several weather sources were consulted for this test. Calibration instructions received from Cheney by e-mail recommended taking the instrument apart and adjusting it internally,then re-assembling it. Yeah right. All four were returned for refund.More Chinese junk."
1,Disappointing thermometer,"I purchased this thremometer and mounted it outside under a roof, so it did not get direct weather. It worked fine for almost two years and then suddenly was about 15-20 degrees off. I contacted the company and told them I was unhappy with less than two years of service from their product and requested a replacement. The return response told me that the product was only warrantied for one year and there was nothing they could do for me. My advice is to save your money and buy a different brand product that has some quality and customer support."
1,Piece of Junk,This Thermometer is about 7 degrees off and there is no way to adjust it so it's worthless.
2,Not brass,"I like the analogue display, but after a few years outside the case is completely rusted. The rust is now leaking onto the face."
2,Acu-Rite Brass Thermometer,This item looks great and I was very happy with it until it recently stopped working. I purchased this thermometer a year ago and within the last month I noticed that it reads 65 Degrees all the time! Disapointing...
1,Not Brass,"If this is brass, it is a new kind of brass that rusts! Mine is covered in rust.Maybe it means the company must have a lot of ""brass"" for selling them!Mine lasted about two years and then simply stopped working. Got stuck at 51 degrees F. Unlike some of the other reviews, mine was pretty accurate while it was working. Luck of the draw, I guess. Looked nice when new.I see the company has several models, including ""copper"" and ""stainless (HAH!) steel"". I'd avoid all of them."
2,Maybe good for beginners?,"These videos may be good for someone who is just starting to play guitar and has some interest in gypsy jazz playing. However, I don't feel that it is useful for anyone who has intermediate or advanced skills. Most of the things discussed in the video can be picked up simply by listening and the extended examples of these basic concepts are not neccessary. The guy who is featured in the video is also kind of annoying, but that's just my opinion."
1,Freedom - Not Yet,"Since I bought this game I've seen it crash 9 times. I have never actually played it because it keeps crashing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. Still no luck. I contacted their customer support by email and have received no reply. The last time I installed it, it caused my computer to continually crash without even starting the game."
3,"Poorly edited-Read ""Yes I Can"" instead","For beginners, this isn't bad. But those who are familiar with ""Yes I can"" and ""Why Me?"" (the Davis bios that this book was edited from) will not be happy. Too much of the good stuff from ""Yes I Can"" is missing, such as Sammy's guilt over his treatment of James Dean and his own mistreatment at the hands of other children and teenagers. Those were some of the most moving parts of that book and they should be included here. Oh well, you can always read the original."
2,Sammy A review,"This book tries to cram together Yes I Can and Why Me? and in the process the humor and emotions which made those books great, especially Yes I Can, is lost. There is VERY LITTLE new material here. This book is a waste of time to anyone who already knows about Sammy and if they don't this isn't the place to start."
5,inspiring,"I thought this book was very inspiring. This book was very good, and kept me very interested. I like how they put in pictures, and exact dates of when things happened to Sammy Davis Jr. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about an all around performer.Reviewer: Samantha, Cisneros"
1,This book SUCKS,I found this book to be useless ... for the skilled Net Admin. If you think that you are semi-skilled in the field most of this knowledge is commonplace.
2,Too small,"Virtual Pose is a great idea but could have been executed better. There are six photos to a page with a large margin so the photos are pretty small. More than two thirds are in black and white. Every other page on the left is a sketch so there are no photos there. The photos on the included CD are very small and can not be zoomed in without getting fuzzy.All color, less blank space, and high resolution on the CD would make this much better.If you want full color and high resolution, try other books. For example, check out ""Art Models"" instead. You can get it with a disk that has all the photos and they can be zoomed in so they are HUGE."
2,Unnatural Poses,"If you wish you had models to pose for you in strange and unnatural poses, this is the book for you. But if you were hoping for natural poses (woman sitting in chair, man walking, woman climbing stairs, man throwing ball, woman picking up object from floor, that type of thing) that you might use in illustrations, you, like I, would be sadly disappointed. I'm returning it!"
4,An OK package for a good CD,"When I ordered it I was anxious to receive the book to use it for sculpturing work.I was dissapointed at first: the poses are no as beautiful as the contents of other artistic nudes books, and the images are rather small. On the upside it provides several angles of the same pose, which is great for sculpture.It was about two weeks later that I put the CD-ROM in my computer. My apprectation for the product really increased.You can open the files and print very many angles and details, resolution is not very high, but it becomes a fantastic visual reference.I am a sure buyer of Virtual Pose 3."
2,Censor Happy,"I really liked the idea of this book. The photos are nice BUT they are tooooo small. And, they censored the females, but not the males. What artist wants that? GROW UP! The rotation tool on the CD is really great. Love it! BUT again the pictures are too small. Even with the zoom, you loose resolution. Not useful for sketching with my computer. The movie lessons included are nice, would like more of that. If they improve those two matters, then I could recommend this book. Untill then, pass."
2,Disappointed,"The idea is a good one, but the photographs are very small and badly chosen and extremely artificail (unless you are an airbrush amateur that wants to paint on trucks). There is even some retouching on the photographs - come on! The book itself is also filled with someone's completely unnecessary and not very good drawings.And the CD is no better - it is filled with music instead of photographs in higher resolution. The accompanying tutorials go along the line of ""feel the line, let yourself go"" and similar new age stuff for the first few minutes (and then I turned it off)."
3,"nice product, but could be better","Great idea, and great to have for the price I suppose. But theres a few things I should give a heads up on to anyone debating on buying VP2.The image resolution is only so-so. Its not hard to see the pixilation when you expand quicktime to a larger size and even easier when you zoom in. A few of the frames have a pesky blurred/doubled over second edge.The interface included is pretty small, about 4 inch view space on my monitor. This was remedied by simply opening the QT files directly off the cd rom.Lastly, Virtual Pose 2 only works with Apple Quicktime.So, unless you buy or happen to own quicktime pro [$30.00 upgrade], you will be unable to print any of the images on the program, make quicktime go into full/wide screen or shift your view around the image when zooming in [you can only zoom in on the center of the image with normal quicktime]."
1,Great Concept Poorly Executed,"It is a pity that so promising a concept has been so poorly executed. Unlike some of the other reviewers I do not mind that the photos are predominantly black and white, as this can make tonal studies easier; but I do mind that the reference photos are too small and commercially photographed in flat light making them virtually useless for any real study. The accompanying CD is not any better, containing low resolution photographs displayed in a microscopic splash screen. Quite obviously this was not created with the artist in mind. This is a waste of your money and your time."
2,Can not reset password,"I have a few of this units, and for the most part I was happy.When configuring one of them, I somehow made a mistake typing in the password, and made the same mistake twice. Or perhaps the machine just freaked out when I set the password. Button line - I could not log on to it after setting the password.There is no reset switch. Nothing about resetting the password in the documentation. Called Linksys. They told me there was no way to reset the password. Told me my only option was to RMA the unit for a new one.With no way to reset the password, I will never buy one of these units again."
4,Ateco disposable bags,"These bags are very sturdy and will hold up. They are a bit stiff, but I would rather have that than a seam busting out while using."
3,Meh.,"These are just a bit too stiff for me. It's hard to twist the top closed, and they are bit hard to squeeze and get a consistent line. OTOH, they definitely work, and I haven't broken one yet. I think I honestly bought the wrong material. These might work for some, but I don't like them. Anyone want to buy an opened package?"
3,"Good, but I like Wilton better","I use a LOT of disposable pastry bags and when I came across this 200 count box for a good price I decided to give them a try. I was disappointed, however, in the inflexibility of the plastic. When I insert the coupler in the bag I like for it to be snug so the icing doesn't leak past it and ooze out into the ring. These bags are stiffer and it was very difficult, and sometimes impossible to get the coupler where I wanted it.They are okay, but once I use them up, I'll be going back to the Wilton ones."
5,If Men and Women Would Follow the Messages,"There would be lasting peace on Earth. Barbara Rose brought through a gift to humanity that frees each person to honor his or her own truth.I was delighted at the broad scope of the messages in this book, as well as how easily anyone can understand them. My mind was awakened more than I thought it would be, and this is a tribute to the non judgmental truth that pierces the veil of separation, including separation from our own selves.This is an epic book that serves humanity at a time when we all need the messages the most. Highly recommended for the profound book that it is."
1,"If God was like man, we would all be dead.","Do not buy this book expecting to find truth. If you are a Christian, do not buy this book believing that the ""god"" she speaks of is God Almighty that we worship. This book is humanism at it's worst. Teaching people that whatever path they choose is right as long as it feels right to them is a terribly misleading lie. This is the kind of teaching Paul was referring to when he said ""For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths."" 2 Timothy 4:3-4This book is a poison that flows slowly to the hearts and minds of it's readers."
5,A Most Un-Biased Look at How Divine Source Views Humankind,"If God Was Like Man is a book that will cause you to take a strong look at your judgments, prejudices, and how you relate to both yourself, as well as others. This book is an unprecedented beacon of hope for humanity, as well as a sure path for guidance as to how to live and focus on self, rather than condemn others.It is a book that many of a lower vibration will judge, as they judge others, and try to cause division and discord, as opposed to work in harmony for the betterment of all of humanity.If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would, because it has made a significant difference in my life, and has caused me to change many views of others that I used to judge, which has helped me heal, and grow.An outstanding book for those who wish to accelerate on all levels of life on the individual level, as well as a planetary one. A Must Read!"
5,Answers from the Highest Realm. Profound!,"I have been in awe of If God Was Like Man from the beginning of this enlightened book to the end, so much so that I wished it never ended!Based on many years of deep spiritual study, and reading the enlightened works of ascended masters, I can let you know from reading this book that Barbara Rose is a Lightworker who was given a mission to uplift the spiritual consciousness of humanity. If God Was Like Man does just that. It will awaken you on many levels, and bring you NEW insight and answers that will provide the impetus to enlightenment, growth, change, and awakening, just as was meant to do. BUY THIS BOOK if you want to have realizations and awakening that will both serve you, and all of humanity. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,IT'S A NICE BOOK,"iT'S A NICE BOOK, INTERESTING, FOR ME IT DIDN'T SPEAK SO MUCH OF GOD, BUT OF SOMEONE'S BELIEFS. AND THAT'S OK, THESE BELIEFS MEAN WELL. BUT HAVE HEARD THEM BEFORE."
2,I think nearly all the 5-star reviews are not authentic,"I bought this book in April 2005 based on the overwhelming number of 5-star reviews. After re-reading portions of the book today, some of which I thought were strange, I became suspicious of the huge number of 5-star reviews and relatively few that were negative. For example, God suggests raising the age of adulthood and voting to 21-25?I started skimming the 5-star reviews and noticed most were in a six month period starting in November 2003. Rather curious. Amazon might want to add software to detect a suspicious pattern of reviews."
5,One of the Most Enlightening Books I Have Ever Read,"If God Was Like Man brought me tremendous newfound clarity and enlightenment in simple language. Like another reviewer wrote, this was accomplished in the most non-judgmental manner, from the love and compassion God has for all of humanity.I can only say that this book completely altered my views on so many topics, from same sex marriage, to the death penalty, to fidelity and personal relationships, and even on creation and manifestation. Barbara Rose clearly has a gift that will make a true impact on society, and in our world. This book will create new understandings for everyone who reads it. I can tell you that each of my five siblings read this book, and they ALL had the same reaction - WOW! What a Book! If you want to read God's view about us all, and get to the heart of the matter in the simplest language, BUY THIS BOOK!It WILL have a tremendous influence on your life."
5,Profound Spiritual Truth. A MUST Read,"If God Was Like Man will rock the foundations of the cold and cruel world we have lived in, to create a new view for all people.This new view comes from God, and it is all embracing, strong, gentle, compassionate, and wise.If humanity lived the messages in this book, there would certainly be instantaneous peace on Earth for all people.A great thanks to Barbara Rose for taking dictation. A job well done, and will be well remembered as a beacon of light for all people on Earth. Highly recommended!"
2,I thought God could do better,"Looks like I go against popular opinion here but, I didn't think much of the book. I was so excited to get it and read it. I genuinely wanted to hear what God had to say about some very confusing issues. I'm just kinda dissappointed that God didn't say anything I hadn't heard (usually more eloquently) before. I can't believe God doesn't have something original to say! It was also sort of weird that God's opinions were often focused on problems specifically germaine to Ms. Rose's life. And I suspect his sometimes limited view of complex issues (like the environment)probably mirrors Ms. Rose's own opinions. Bottom line is its a bad Neale Donald Walsh knock-off and I'm sorry I spent $18 on it."
5,Answers That Really Woke Me Up!,"I've been searching and seeking, reading and meditating. I've asked questions to gain insight, and heard answers that seemed logical but didn't really hit home, until I read IF GOD WAS LIKE MAN.This incredible book made everything click. I finally understand why I am on this Earth. The spiritual teachings that I've been studying have finally been put into plain English where the wisdom of the ages now makes sense.This book is for everyone who wants answers that only the truth can bring.It addresses so many areas that impact humanity, and brings astonishing solutions for the betterment of us all. If you want a book that will really make a difference in your life, this is the one. HIGHLY recommended!"
5,A Masterpiece from God,"As surely as the sun lights the sky and brings warmth to all life on Earth, so too does If God Was Like Man bring light to the ever thirsting soul, and warmth to the hearts of those who reach for solutions and answers.This enlightening book sets the stage for personal and planetary evolution where the language is simple, and the wisdom profound.A heart felt thank you to Barbara Rose for allowing the Divine Light to flow forth to embrace humanity at a time when our evolution is at a succinctly critical stage. This is a book to keep and refer back to for life."
5,Answered My Questions,"I really got a lot of answers from this book. More than I thought I would. I never knew that I could have direct communication with a higher self, and I never knew if I was heard when I prayed. I tried the suggestions and guidelines to receive answers and I was surprised at the information that I did receive. It was really peaceful, and gave me a better understanding than I had before.More than the personal information, I liked the way this book reads. There's just too much judgment in our world, and this book has none.I got a new perspective, without all of the preaching, and the love that I felt from the words in this book brought me inner peace, while it gave me a better understanding of the whole picture in our world.It's a really good book. I understand more because of it."
1,Pass this up,I bought this book at the thrift store completely based upon the cool hallograms on the cover and throughout. I finally sat down to read the story and it was awful. Terribly boring. My kids liked some of the pictures but that's about it.
4,Well-written description of a girl whose world falls apart,"13-year-old Rory cannot deal with the fact that her father has left the family. She has closed herself down to the outside world, including her own mother, her father, whom she loves desperately, and her best friend. As if that wasn't enough, she has lost, she fears, the artistic talent which she inherited from her father. Rory's world is clearly delineated here-the mother who works too hard to provide the family's financial necessities, the father driven to paint, even though he is unsuccessful financially, his reluctance to get a paying job of any sort, her mother's yearning not to have to work so long and so hard, and Rory's relationship with her dearest friend, who is developing an interest in the opposite sex that Rory does not yet have. An excellent book."
2,Drawing Lessons,"Drawing LessonsDrawing Lessons is a book about a 13-year-old girl, Aurora who can't deal with the fact that her dad left her family. She saw him kissing another woman but said nothing about it to her mom. It takes Aurora some time before she begins to draw again. I would recommend this book it is a realistic fiction and I felt like some times I could relate to Aurora, he one thing I didn't like about the book was I felt like there was no action I n the beginning of the book but the end was more interesting"
3,"Good story, but not many details","I thoguht the story was pretty good, other than it being a classic ""dad leaves mom"" story, with a child stuck in the middle. There weren't many details though, so it was really hard to visualize what was happening. There wasn't much told about what the house and the barn and all looked like. It was a good story, but weak in the way it was told."
2,"Not ""tight""","Far from being 'tight', this cd goes everywhere and comes back again on the final track, Judgment Day...that and the first three songs, plus maybe two others to be generous, are the only tracks on this album that stand out as anything more than easily ignored background music...as a fan of Tical and after hearing the new single i was somewhat disappointed. However, the tracks that are on are brilliant, and if you are a Meth fan you need this album (if only because he only has one other one!)...There's a lot of bull on this cd, most of the middle-closerto-endof it is pointless, the skit with Chris Rock is annoying. Too much stuff that sounds like Puffy might if that fag ever got some talent, and a bit much with the hardcore gangsta-wannabe bull...in other words much of it is unoriginal and only for 'hard core hip hop fans', it having bored this 'hard core good music fan'...and that's enough dissing out of me."
3,I love it only cuz it's Meth,"Yes, I love the Meth just as much as the next person. His songs caught a hold of me but they let go sooner or later. Only a couple of tracks held on tight. I liked it but Meth, baby, you could've done much better."
4,Strong lyrics - genuinely creepy in places,"Meth's lyrics are outstanding. They're controlled and intelligent. Although the subject matter can get more than a little esoteric and obscure, for the most part he keeps a good flow. The intro sequence is genuinely unsettling- a theme that returns from time to time throughout the album. Anyone who likes the other Wu releases certainly won't be disappointed. For everyone else- the beats are solid but atonal and very tense. It's not the west coast groove that pop fans are used to, so try before you buy."
3,some good tracks,"of all the wu tang clan members,method man is probably the one that is known more commercially.on this album the theme is the end of the world and most of the tracks are intented to be dark.aside from ""spazzola"",""dangerous ground"",and""judgement day""the album is pretty whack.it has too many skits and its too comedic for a wu tang album.not the best of the wu tang solo albums."
2,Meth fell asleep for this one,"For all of us who were long awaiting meth's sophmore release, I could sadly say that Tical 2000 is a big time flop. With the exception of a couple of tracks including his hot single Judgement Day (which he produced himself) and Break ups 2 make ups, this album lacks much in terms of quality and beats. Many of the beats are boring and repetitive, and some of the guest rappers like Street who have shined before stink up the joint on this one. The simple and grimy beats and smooth flows of Meth's first album Tical prove to be one of Wu's classics, but Meth's attempt to go mainstream on a solo fail, for not only does he not draw the mainstream MTV crowds, he fails to retain his old school Wu followers. Better luck next time meth!"
4,A good sophmore effort,"The problem with so many tracks is that you can lose memntum and or originality and then adding so many guest stars (Left Eye, Mobb Deep, Streetlife, Capponada, Chris Rock, Ed Lover, Raekwon, Redman...just to name a very few) you can risk losing limelight. The greatest thing about this CD is that, while there is some filler, Meth never loses his footing on the floor. He is the star of this album and every guest just compliments Meth's ability to comand the album. In fact, my favorite song ""step by step"" doesn't even have a guest rapper. So if your a fan of the Wu-Man they call Method Man AKA Jonny Blaze AKA The Iron Lung AKA...no I'm just kiddin'...anyway, if your a fan of the man they call Meth then pick this up because whatever Meth puts his name on you know is gonna be hot!"
4,this albums aight,"i have heard alot of people tell me this album is weak but i do not think so, meth mans lyrics are tight(i know he is no gza but all the same he can flow with no stutters) and his deep unique voice sits on beats well. this album is not commercial no body in their right mind would talk about satanic verses if they wanted to do a commercial album. compared to tical its not as ground braking with the beats because wu-tang from the days of 36 chambers changed the face of rap music and many artist followed suit so this album would have come across like ""i heard it all before"" because bascally it came out too late. but all in all i think its a good album with good lyrics and alright beats(a lot better than most artists) and at least it sounds and feels like a wu album"
3,"Meth could have came better, the beats are slammin a little",Meth still has the ability to flow and the beats back him up but the things he raps about are tired and he needed some solo albums.
2,Lyrics-tight; tracks- not living up to meth's standards,"Meth brings the pain again and proves why he is one of the best hip hop lyricists. However, the tracks are too busy and don't flow with Meth's voice. It seems like the tracks are overtaking his voice. (Smooth out the tracks and let Meth's voice flow with some butter tracks)"
4,Solid.,Not his best outing but I do like many of the songs on this record. Meth is very gifted lyrically so you just can't hate.
4,"2 good songs, thats it","if judgement day and break ups to make ups were the only 2 songs on the cd itwould be worth lstening to the whole thing. all the skits take up space, and the other songs just blow. i still like it cuz those two songs are dope but dont buy it if you want a whole cd of good songs."
2,JOHNNY BLAZE AIN'T BLAZIN........,"After putting out the weakest Wu solo offering to date, I really thought that Mr. Meth would come with a better LP than this....I think since the day I bought it I may have listened to it 3 times, and now it sits quietly in my CD collection collecting dust...After two just-about-wack joints, I have come to the conclusion that the Ticallion Stallion should stick to cameo appearances with the other Wu affiliates and give his solo career a permanent rest..."
4,Only REAL Hip-Hop fans can feel this one.,"Yo, this album is for people who use both sides of they brains. The lyrics are off-the-hook, for real. To understand this album yo third eye truly must be open. The only problem with this album is that there are to may skits. All in all The Hot Nix has put it down once again."
5,all that a bucket of chicken with a side order of cole slaw!,"this is the first cd i have bought that had anything to do with wu and it is definitely bangin!! i love all the beats, the lyrics & the track with d'angelou is tight!!! much props to method man he is on point like a needle!!"
3,The album is decent but I expected more from Method man.,The album has some solid songs but it misses more often than not. It just does not flow as I had hoped. It is as good as his first album but I was hoping he would have grown in the last four years. I was disappointed. This album falls short of the hype but it is still laced with a few pumping songs. Any hip hop fan will find something to like but do not expect it to rip from beginning to end.
3,Mef's Skit Album,"Man, this album had so much potential but it's heavily overshadowed buy inconsistency and a whole slew of skits. You'd think that an album with RZA, Tru Master, Havoc, & other Wu-Gambinos behind the boards would automatically be labeled a classic. Though this album isn't as good as many anticipated, it is not as bad as everyone is saying it is. This should have been a 13-track release including the only two skits that made since on the album ""Sweet Love"" & ""Shaolin What"". I guess he didn't see what acting did to L.L.Cool J and Ice Cube."
4,Wu-Tang To The Fullest,"I see nothing wrong with this album, Method Man's second album has solid production from RZA and all of the appearences are tight. Meths rhymes are hot and he doesnt miss a beat. My favorites songs Perfect World, Cradle Rock, Dangerous Grounds, Sweet Love, Torture, Suspect Chin Music, Big Dogs, Break Ups To Make Ups, Judgment Day and Killin' Fields."
2,Method Man really let me down.,I like Method Man just as much as everybody else But this CD is Just trash. Even the most die hard wu tang fans would have to admit it.Why you think the Source Magazine didnt rate this album they dont wanna hurt his feelings.
2,C'mon Meth You Know You Can Do Better Than This!,This Meth Album needs some help. Don't get me wrong Meth brings mad flava and that's why he gets two stars but his beats needs some serious help. I mean it seems like whatever beat someone gives him he tries to wrap to. He needs to be very selective or he needs to just stick to collaborating with other people because that is when he is at his best.
4,Its AAAAAAAiiggghhhhhhtttttttt,"Mza is the best rapper ever, but he could have done some better beats. The CD is still worth it do'."
5,Apocalyptic Lyrical Slang Bang,"This is a good CD to buy if you like Wu-Tang style beats. This is slightly different from Method Man's premiere CD, Tical. The beats have similarities and he doesn't seem to go as wild as in the first cd but I still enjoyed it."
3,Tical 2000: Not all that and a bag of Photato Chips,I reacently purchased this cd and its not all its cut out to be.Dont get me wrong it was good.But I ended up with the censored version.Take my advice and dont shop for cds at wal-mart.
5,best album by mef,"there is just no bad songs on this album every song tends to flow with the album , must by cd.bestsongs:torturecradle rockperfect worldspazzolasweet love"
1,WTF is this ????????,"Method Man spent more time on the Judgement Day track than he did the entire album, that should pretty much explain it right there.If you see this album in a store for sale for 25 cents, I would suggest you dont waste your money."
4,Better than I thought!,"I am not a Wu Tang fan, but I like Method Man. When I saw his Cd in the Store I said let me get it and see if it's good. I did not regret it. The whole CD is all that. The song with D'Angelo is tight!! Over all this was a good second come back for Meth."
3,Just skip to track 9 and enjoy,"Method Man shows us once again how good he can be when paired up with other good rappers, and how bad he can be when rapping alone. Tracks 1-8 are fairly uninteresting, but starting with Ed Lover's skit, the CD really picks up the pace. He's a real breath of fresh air after the noise that's been calling itself rap for the past few years. The question to ask is when is Inspektah Deck coming out with his solo?"
2,mmmm....,"I dont know why, but i never loved Meth, everybody seem to love him except me. There's some Tight Song on tha Disc, but not enough to buy it. If your a fan of Meth, see for Tical, it's better."
1,Terrible CD,"This was the worst CD of the year. There were no classic down right dirty Wu-Tang cuts. To me, it was by far the worst Wu album ever."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"My, oh my, does this CD ****. Wow, Method Man's new album is the worst rap I've ever heard in my life. This stuff is just pure ****, the lyrics are totally offkey with the beats, and it's just plain repatitive. Your money is better spent on a Beastie Boys CD."
3,meth 2 g,"when i first got this album i really liked it.i listened to it a lot, then the beats got to me, just like bobby digital.they are kind of funky, nah mean.although wu members make this cd very good, and wu-fam.street life is all over this one, and i really feel street so i was enjoying that.also the meth and red song is pretty tight.but i dont really like all the skits, the first time their funny, then they get annoying.but again if your a true wu head you will go out and buy this, like i did."
5,Sweet,"A great album that should be in eveyones CD player.Method Man is an amazing MC.He doesn't get enough credit though.Although rapping about destruction of mankind and terminator style raps do sound dumb at first it's brilliant. One thing that might turn people off though is it's death like feel to it.It is darker than most metal albums but that turns out to be a plus in the end.An album that deserves to be heard.Method Man is a way better rapper than DMX,he's his own man unlike that Tupac wanna be."
4,I believe method is the hottest right about now,"I believe that Methods album was pretty good. the hottest joint was ""break ups 2 make ups"" fea. D'Angelo. Method is the most lyrical rapper out along with DMX, Jay-Z, Nas, and the rookie of the bunch Jarule. o yeah and u can't forget Redman. All i have to say is meth keep doin' what you doin' and don't give up and stay real and hardcore i'm out."
5,Crazy Dope!,"i love method man, who doesn't? It was about time he came out w/ another album. I would think though that for him waiting 2 years to release this it could have had a bit of a improvement on the beats and repetitive lyrics. But other than that, its all good!!!So if u like hip hop...Buy It!!!"
2,Drum VS. Disc brakes,"Save your money. This movie is not made well at all. Filmed so dark in many places, you can not see who's talking. There is a real reason the film did not make the big time. To compare this film to ""On any Sunday"" would be like comparing drum to disc brakes. Very poorly done. Waste of time. Go ride."
1,doesn't work,this product didn't work from the get-go. and returning it is not worth the price of shipping. beware of these people.
1,Samsung Charger,None of the reviews seem to be talking about the listed item which looks like a standard OEM wall charger - NOT a cradle...
1,Out-of-Box Failure x 2,"Ordered two of these AC Chargers through Amazon from BESTCELLBUY. One for home and one for travel. Needed to replace the original I received from Samsung when I purchased my Samsung Omnia i910 Smartphone (originally released version). These units look similar to the original with the exception of how the cord attaches to the wall plug. Order was received per expected shipping terms, however, neither of the two units work with my phone. I can see the possibility of something being wrong with one, but the likelihood of both of them failing is much more remote. Either these units are all poorly designed or their was a significant issue at the factory when the batch that my 2 units came from were produced."
2,While nice..,"Does not fit wrap handle saws. It is about 1"" too narrow in width (or depth as you're looking at the front.It needs a new size."
3,plastic box,nice box--but you have to open the lid and take down the side to remove the saw. Kind of inconvenient.
4,High quality well made case!,"I bought this to store my Husqvarna 316E electric I ordered from one of the big box stores! Saw fits rather nicely. I like all the storage compartments/indentations in case for scrench,files etc! Looses a star cause indentation on bottom of case should be deeper as quart of bar oil that fits in indentation falls over instead of staying upright!"
5,great product,Great case to haul my chainsaw in. Looks like it should do the job when I head out to the mountains to cut wood.
5,Husqvarna power box,This is a nice quality product as to be expected since it is a brand name product. I am able to keep all cutting and sharpening tools together in one place and keep my saw clean and protected. The service and shipping are excellent!
5,great price and sturdy,"We looked in store and only found soft cases, this was $30 cheaper, sturdier and has a spot for everything but fuel, my fiance was very pleased and our chainsaw fits very well. Excellent buy!!"
3,Carrying Case,"Perhaps a little too bulky...like a square volkswagon....but gets the job done..couldn't understand why i received two blade coverfs, but will use them somehow"
2,Powerbox carrying case,Not necessary although made well and looks good. Carries supplies more than it stores the saw it was made for
3,Stihl MS290CBE does not fit without major modifications,The Craftsman case works better with a Stihl. The Stihl cases suck because there is no room for accessories in the case. These cases are great because they stack and provide a work surface to set the saw on while in the woods.
3,Poorly made,"The unit is very well designed and easy to use. However, the latches that hold the lid shut keep falling off. They are not designed to stay on because there is too much give in the plastic to hold them in position."
1,How horrible,Should have burned the money I used to get this album- it would have been better spent.
4,Could be better,"I've listened to the Bee Gees ever since I was a kid, and I've always looked forward to a good compilation of their hits. The Record does a fine job, but some excellent songs are missing: I.O.I.O., Melody Fair, Run to me, Charade, Mr. Natural, etc., which is a let down. And the lack of lyrics together with the skinny linear notes is very disappointing."
5,Fantastic collection with some missing material,"This is the most complete set of top Bee Gees hit yet. It may not include all the singles, the ones here are all Top 30. ""Jumbo"" and ""My World"" were top charters, but are missing. The piano intro to ""Lonely Days"" was sloppily chopped by Poldor. I've heard that a recall may be in effect. No matter. All the best songs are here and the priceless new versions of ""Immortality"" and ""Islands In The Stream"" are great, alng with the others. This is better than ""The Very Best Of The Bee Gees"" and replaces all of thier ""Greatest"" or ""Best of's"", but cannot match the Box Set, unless you are looking for only their best!"
1,Not in good condition!,"I was very disappointed in the condition of this cd. I am only able to listen to three songs, it skips over the rest of the songs. So disappointing, I had really wanted this cd."
5,The BEST of the BeeGees,"If you love Disco go for it. This is the sound of that age. What is of course amazing is that you can still hear their music on the pop radio stations and not just in the elevator and grocery store.Great value for your money, 42 hits on two disks. Better than buying the sound track from Saturday Night Fever, as if.. this is the group that defined that movie.Ok, so I'm not some sophisticated music critic but I grew up humming this stuff and now I use it to cut out the noise at work. Feel good, get up and get working music. What's not to like?"
5,Almost the whole record,"Well, of course in every Greatest hits compilation, there are songs not on this cd.To start positively: almost all the songs you are looking for are included, as well as some interesting bee gees remakes of originals, of songs written by them, but were sung by other artists.The only song I think is really missing is Paying the price of love, but nevertheless, its a great cd, that includes much more than the Very best of, which was only 1 cd."
5,BEE GEES THEIR GREATEST HITS THE RECORD,"Since the 1966 release of their first international hit, New York Mining Disaster, Bee Gees songs have topped the charts in five successive decades. They are the only group to have placed five singles simultaneously in the US Top 10, and to have monopolised the US charts with six consecutive No1s. Seven Grammies, a BRIT Award for Outstanding Contribution To Music and 10 Lifetime Achievement Awards have contributed to earning the band honoured places in both the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame and the Songwriters Hall Of Fame.Understanding, many top artists reserve the utmost respect for the Brothers Gibb but the way in which their songs have transcended generations is virtually unique. Megastars as diverse as Bono of U2, Brain Wilson of the Beach Boys, Noel Gallagher of Oasis, and Destiny's Child, have expressed their admiration for trio of Mancunian tearways who grew up to dominate the world's music charts."
5,You cant beat the Bee Gees,"I love this Album as it has all of their greatest hits! They are extremely talented. The only criticism I have of the album is they have two lots of fans, 60s & Disco fans. It would really help if their 60s songs on one CD and their disco on the other, as I only listen to the second half of the first CD and the first half of the second CD to get the disco songs. This is a must buy."
3,OVERDONE,"TO BE HONEST, I THINK THE 1990 ONE IS BETTER.UNLESS YOU WANT EVERY POSSIBLE SONG THEYVE EVER DONE AND POINTLESS COVERS OF THEIR OWN SONGS,THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. WHERES SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN FOR A START? IT DOESNT EVEN HAVE ALL THEIR SINGLES ON IT!"
3,BE CAREFUL!,"This is a great album, but some of the songs ARE NOT THE ORIGINALS. If you want an original copy of ""Emotion"" don't buy this."
5,Great Music,Such talent! I play this CD over and over again! Has all the great songs that I grew up listening to. You won't go wrong with this disc!
2,Bee Gees Not so Greatest Re-Mix,"I have enjoyed the BeeGees for sometime. And was really looking forward to this double cd set. Many of the songs are re-mixes. Big mistake. When something is good leave it alone. I was really disappointed. Some of the so called Greatest, I have never heard."
5,Celebrating over 40 years of Bee Gees music!!!!!,"Truly awesome stuff.I've heard their older songs before...so not much of a surprise there,but Disc 2 is superb.I would rather say that this is the CD that all fans especially MUST have!!! All albums have been covered,including their 2001 release.I should you guys to purchase the CD itself and let the tracks speak for themselves.You will love the new recordings of ""Emotion"", ""Heartbreaker"", ""Islands In The Stream"" and ""Immortality""......Absolutely amazingly done. These songs are worth the money,and also the packaging is really done well......Go for it!!! Highly recommended.I loved ""EMOTION"" the best.I wonder why they didn't come up with tracks like ""Chain Reaction"",""Woman In LOVE""........Awwww......that would have been great too...But this is a GREAT compilation."
5,"Buy It, For God's Sakes!!!","Okay, I may be only 10 years old, but I know good music. The Bee Gees are AWESOME!!!!! Now, I hope you all know that Maurice just died, and you should have seen be cry when I heard that. I LOVE THE BEE GEES!!!!!!SO buy this album!!!"
5,The Best Choice Of Songs,"I kept trying to make sense of how the Bee Gees could choose thier best songs on this set, while excluding so many big hits. It appears that first they chose all the number one hits, even those sung by others ('Emotion', 'If I Can't Have You', 'Immortality', etc.)Then with the limited space, they included only those songs that reached the Top 30 in the USA and Britain. This left out great songs like 'Paying The Price Of Love', 'You Win Again'(UK hit only), 'Boogie Child', 'The Woman In You', etc.)The line had to be drawn somewhere. It doesn't matter. This is simply the cream of the crop. The rest is available elsewhere. What a team of talented brothers!"
3,Remastered Bee Gees,"This review is not about the Bee Gees or their performances but the audio quality of this recording. Up to and including the 'Saturday Night Fever' soundtrack, their sound was much too 'bassy' with the highs severely clipped. On this remastered set, the sound is much brighter and less 'bassy'. It's still not great sound on their older material, for example, a couple are 'muddy' while some others are over-produced for the Bee Gee vocals. All in all though, if you like their music and would like it to come more 'alive', this is the set to buy as most of their hits are included."
2,Too much disco music for this girl...,"I bought this CD because I thought that it would have a lot of good music on it, but I found that I was only interested in two or three songs, ""To Love Somebody"" and ""Massachusetts"" being two. The rest of the songs were really dated, and don't seem to hold up well.I like the Bee Gees, but I have to disagree with Mr. Robbie. The Bee Gees would not have been able to exist had it not been for the Beatles. The Beatles were around long before the Bee Gees. At one time, the Bee Gees were a Beatles copycat band, not the other way around. In fact, I wouldn't even be writing this if it weren't for Mr. Robbie's comment about the Beatles.I give this CD two stars, not because it's a poor collection of songs, because the Bee Gees were talented entertainers, if nothing else. However, too many of the songs on the CD are disco-type stuff, and it was like being in a time warp listening to it."
5,The Great Bee Gees,"This is music that you sit back and relax and remember. It is as smooth as when you first heard it. How many songs touch you as much as the Bee Gees 'Words', 'I Started a Joke', and 'Islands in the Stream'. Not too many."
5,Best Deal,"Every song on this album is the ""cream of the crop"" so to speak. Not only is it a must for any Bee Gees fan, it's great for anyone unfamiliar with the whole Bee Gees catalog. The Record is a way get an idea of what they sounded like when they were first starting out moving on through the years and evolving into who they are today. You'll get an idea of why they have lasted as long as they have through the changing tastes of the music world - they have changed to reflect what people appreciate.Though they are closely identified with the genre, only a very small part of the Bee Gees is disco. The Record proves it in a fantastic way."
1,Excrement,In an age of loose morals and available prostitution this video still manages to offend me.
3,Accessory is the word...,These shoes are quite pretty when you are wearing them and sitting on the couch or walking for short distances. I find them to be slightly unstable for walking around the house and prefer to wear them while watching TV or as slippers. They do seem to keep your feet warmer than when you have no slippers on at all and can enhance lingerie or make you feel like the princess you are.~The Rebecca Review
5,Great all around!,"You can't go wrong. Rozen Maiden is an amazing series, and home to my favorite fictional character of all time: Suigintou.As with all anime, there is a controversy among fans between subs and dubs.I for one don't care. However, the only problem I had with this one was the dubbing AND subbing for Suiseiseki.They did a great job of translating ""desu"" into ""so"" and ""such"" as best they could.(ie: ""That so hurt!"").But they needed MORE of it, in either dub and/or sub, to fully capture this trademark quirk of Suiseiseki that has made her infamous throughout the Internet.I would say that this is the only flaw I could find with it, so I'll still give it 5 stars."
4,Murder at the Horse Show,"I read this book under its original title and it was good then and it will be good now. I knew the author and still know his brother, George. All of his books should be the basis for a television series shot on location. Mark was a master of words having been graduated from Brown University and then going to Trinity College Dublin. He knew of whence he wrote."
3,Death of an Irish Tradition,I generally like Bartholomew Gill's style of story telling. This was the first of his books that I would call Fluff. The story rambled. There seemed to be more emphasis on background than on the mystery. Maybe because I read the book out of sequence it seemed sophomoric compared to the others.
4,Tribal,"The daughter, Mairead Kehlen Caughey, is eighteen. The death of the mother occurred in the afternoon. Her larynx was crushed. It is Dublin, Victorian row houses.The victim's brother is James Joseph Keegan who was present at the scene of the crippling of Sir Roger Bechel-Gore the previous year. The plot is clever and twisted, following the strange paths of some west Ireland families whose members are gaining a significant presence in Dublin and national life.The Dublin Horse Show is the occasion for a number of seeming coincidences to rile Peter McGarr. They lead to the settlement of the mysteries surrounding his case. It seems that there is a new political and commercial ascendancy in Ireland. This is excellent."
5,forgot some stuff for my research,i want some more pictures about his designs if u can plz help me thank u
4,Um... where's the blu-ray version?,"this set is nice and all, but i paid 5 grand to watch and rewatch this in HD. i want the whole thing on Blu-ray, cause my HD Tivo is filled! ugh"
5,A look into the Jockey/Horse world...both tough to get into,"If you want to learn about what it takes to get into the Kentucky Derby and if you enjoy watching beautiful horses move at their true speed, this movie is for you!"
3,"Great content, poor DVD","I've tried two DVDs of this documentary, and neither one will play in its entirety on my (Sony) DVD player. They get just about to the ""Kentucky"" section, then hang up and refuse to play or fast forward. Finally ended up downloading a copy on iTunes to be able to watch the film. The documentary itself is very good, and I think would be interesting even to people who don't follow horse-racing. Rather than buy a DVD, I would suggest renting or borrowing it first to see if the DVD will play on your player."
4,"Roses, roses.","I'm always interested in anything to do with the Kentucky Derby. Some of the information was new to me and some was quite familiar. I enjoyed watching the trainers, jockeys and their families as they pursued their dream of winning America's greatest horse race. I also liked the focus on the courageous Barbaro. This is a video I'll watch more than once. It was good to relive some past Derby races. All these talented horses and trainers need to be remembered."
2,Eh.,"I didn't enjoy Sensual Phrase and I won't be buying past the second edition.I got sick of the teenagery vapid love (*gasp, gasp, how does he FEEL for me!? How shall I act around him, oh nuuuu*) I lived through that already, I didn't want it in a manga XDThe drawing is cool and the storyline is... okay. But it didn't do it for me, simply put."
5,"It was the cutest ,sad,funny and enjoyable short movie.","Today I sat with my 51/2 year old granddaughter to watch this short movie on HBO, I so loved it,my granddaughter even was teary eye over it we loved it,and thru-out the movie we were both very connected as to everything that was going on ,she later remembered everything about it and wants to see it again it was terrific,then the song by Dionne ,we so loved it, that I'm keeping it to watch many more times..thank you"
5,Friend or Foe?.. I'm Friend,"t.A.T.u's second single is a potent pop/rock track. It involves short, but powerful words that explain the feelings toward somebody when they are there with you, and were they are not.It includes Sting playing the bass and it was co-written by Dave Stewart.The chorus is very catchy. It's a perfect second single, even though i think that the have better songs than this one, and it shows that t.A.T.u. are not just some ""One Hit Wonders"", if you like this single you don't know what you are missing in the CD, so check it out.In addition to that, the remixes make the song a perfect dance/trance song. I'm Sure you won't be dissapointed."
3,Undecided just yet,"I chose this changing table because of style and price.I assembled it myself at 34 weeks pregnant.My issues at this point are these.#1 1 end was a little dinged but it wasn't bad enough to lug it back to the store.#2 This table does NOT come with any padding on top, Also they do not tell you what kind you need or where to get it.#3 1 of the pieces was machined incorrectly so I had to email the company to get a replacment piece, I have just done this so I don't know just yet how that will turn out, hopefully there will be no other issues."
3,Disappointed,The weight of this set is nice and the pattern is beautiful but it has started to tarnish and shouldn't. Very disappointed.
1,Pits and corrodes too easily,"Despite the impressive pattern and sturdy weight, this is the worst flatware I have every owned. It started pitting and corroding almost immediately after the first few uses, especially on the handles.I bought this flatware from another online retailer which provided a less detailed item description than Amazon. Had I known this flatware set was very low-end 18/0 stainless steel, I would have avoided it altogether. From now on, it's only 18/10 for me!"
4,The Feasts of Israel,I love this author. His preparation and study is great and his presentation makes the study interesting and intreaguing.
1,Trash,"You listen and something's just not right. Your ears are perceptive. These CD's are not the original artists as the label clearly lies to you. I bought this a couple years back as Tower Records was dying and got it for just a few bucks. I paid way too much. The label says ""Made in the E.C."" which I guess means the ""European Community"" as elsewhere it admits to being made in Holland. Perhaps they mean that the CD tracks are all by ""Original Artists""... as in ones so original you've never heard them before, but the boxes name all the original hitmakers. But, if any of them are on these discs, those tracks are studio takes that didn't get released. My ear says these are all sound-a-likes and not good enough to make listening enjoyable. It's tiring in fact, because your ear is searching for the familiar and not finding it. It's a real annoying experience. Steer clear of this pile."
4,Mindbending travelog,"A who done it as only PKD could deliver. A new world, a new reality that is never quite what you would expect."
1,Boycott Voyager Entertainment!,"YAMATO is one of the best anime productions ever, but Voyager Entertainment's release of these movies and television DVDs are a disaster! The colors are washed out, grainy and soft, and sound lacks any kind of stereo/surround luster. It appears as if they used some old and cheap copies to produce their DVDs. I only would hope that another company gets hold of the masters and cleans 'em up for true quality DVDs. The original episodes in Japanese language with English subtitles would be nice if digitally remastered properly. Voyager Entertainment is the worse effort for this type of material."
1,Voyager Entertainment Sucks,"These DVD presentations of the fantastic YAMATO movies are typically bad, but BE FOREVER YAMATO in particular (the fourth film) is the worst DVD I have ever seen. The colors are washed out, there's no detail, and it looks like it was recorded off a TV with a bad cable reception using a VHS tape that's been used 300 times. What an insult to a great movie. Voyager Entertainment needs to take a cue from the ROBOTECH REMASTERED series and present YAMATO (the series too) in sparkling new digital transfers. BE FOREVER in particular is begging for an anamorphic widescreen presentation (the film switches to a widescreen aspect ratio for dramatic effect when the crew enters the Dark Nebula). Come to think of it, why does ROBOTECH get such grand treatment and YAMATO, the granddaddy of anime, is left to fester on these criminally overpriced DVDs that are completely unwatchable?"
5,Great Product,"Product is excellent. I have been wearing cold weather gear my entire life, I Live in North Dakota. This product is well made and fits very well."
4,"Classic, Necessary reading for Everyone","I prefer the original (without additions by GH Lang) of this book [otherwise I would give 5 stars] but each person has their own taste. Main thing is you read Earth's Earliest Ages once in your lifetime. Pember's insights, writing style and information is unmatched by any book I have ever read. At 400pps+, this treatment of Genesis through Revelation, touching on forbidden subjects such as demonology, spiritual movements in the world today, non-Biblical theologies and their impact on life and prophecy [incredible fulfillment has taken place of Pember's insights since he wrote this book 150 years ago] is a must read for every inquisitive, thinking person. I cannot imagine anyone not being influenced in their thinking after reading this book. No other book, other than Dake's Bible notes, has come close to matching Pember's information, and at 400+ pages, you have a goldmine of all you need on this subject in one volume. You won't regret it."
3,Classic,"I bought this because my Dad had noted it in his Bible; it's old of course, so does have scientific and/or theological errors, but it also has lots of interesting ideas for thought."
1,Not what I wanted,I bought the swing and had a hard time putting it together because the rope was a hastle. when I finally got it together I didn't like the way it looked. The seat is short and the back looks awkward the way it sits straight up. The first year I had it (last year) it blew over and the wood split in a few places. I've had to replace the wood and keep the swing because you no longer carry this item. It was expensive and I never have liked it. Now I'm out the swing and the money.
5,I have,"not tried this yet, but it is the right size to put a pudding or something in to take to a party."
3,Kama Sutra for the 21st Centry Lovers,I was a little surprised when I recieved this book and found it to be full of pictures of beautiful pepole. I am not that beautiful and I'm a little uncomfortable with that. I also thought the position rating system found in the book was a little confusing. I found some of the positions that looked very similiar if not identical to each other only with different models to have different ratings. I think that it is a bad idea to rate sexual positions. Every body is different and might enjoy something more than another. I find the rating system discouraging. I did like however that this book put the emphasis on having fun and relaxing. That a person should take their time and try new things. This is a good idea book if you need ideas. But try not to get caught up in the ratings. Be willing to try even the things that didn't get such a good rating.
2,Not Anything New,"I understand how the last reviewer felt about ""beautiful people"" in the book. I stopped reading most women's magazines because of the natural (and sometimes unhealthy) comparisons that seem to happen in our minds -- why aggravate the problem? Besides that, I've seen books that cover the same topics and same positions with more pleasing pictures(for me anyway). I don't think there's anything new or ""21st Century"" about this book."
4,LEARNING TO LOVE,I THOUGHT IT WAS A NEW EDUCATION LEVEL FOR ME. LEARNING TO PAY ATTENTION TO OTHERS FEELINGS.
1,Horrible Book!,"The seller said that the book was in ""Very Good"" condition. Trusting them I bought the book. To my suprise the book had highlights on 50% of the pages, writings and anwsers to questions in pencil and pen, and dirt on the side of the book. I would not recommend this seller to anyone!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This software does not make any sense, there is not logic, it jumps from one thing to another, and definetly not for beginners, there is bunch of excercises thrown around but not any lesson or explanation. Additionally the software sometimes doesn't even work properly, takes you again to some of the excercises you have already completed. I bought this course for my nanny, who is a real beginner and she is completly lost, I have to help her to complete the lessons. I am for sure going to return this software, and hopefully my comment prevent you from waisting your money."
4,Dallas in a reflective mood,"This is not a ""new"" Dallas Wayne CD. It was released in 1999 on Dallas's Finnish label Texicalli Records. (Dallas spend many years doing the expat thing in Finland.)On several occasions, I have bought a ""breakout"" album by an artist and liked it so much that I bought some earlier work by the same artist. Inevitably this leads to disappointment. Invisible Man is not up to the very high standard of Dallas's ""breakout"" album Big Thinkin', which is awesome, awesome, awesome. But there is some foreshadowing of things to come. ""Hoedown in Hell"" and ""I Hit the Road (and the Road Hit Back)"" are could fit in with some of the honky-tonk gems on Big Thinkin'.But overall, the tone of the album is more reflective. It's more of a singer-songwriter album. ""Invisible Man"" and ""God Must Have Got Drunk (Last Night)"" are two of my favorites."
4,"Photo studies of the native peoples of the southwest, c1895","Vroman's photographs are often without equal in their ability to capture timelessness and ""being there"". Many fascinating faces, personalities almost visible, of Hopi, Zuni, Laguna, Acoma, Navajo peoples, all taken in their pueblos or hogans.Each photo has a detailed explanation of what is shown, including (often) the story behind it. This is probably the best collection of such photos between covers available on the people of this area, and most were taken between 1895 and 1904."
2,Not compatible with all devices,Not compatible with my Sony MP3 player NWZ-B105F.Compatible for charging my Alcatel GSM.
2,Does not work with new Ipod nano,I have two ipods and a sansa. For whatever reason this product will not work on the new nano. However it does work well on the old ipod mini and the sansa.
5,wonderful,"Lola is written in a narrative poetry style that is simply beautiful. The story, about how a single-father's death affects the people (and the land) that were close to him, is touching. The tale unfolds through the points of view of the father's children; his adult son and daughter, his youngest and mentally handicapped daughter, Lola, his friend/farm laborer, and (my personal favorite) through the unblinking eyes of a garden snake. This is a short but great book, and I highly recommend it!"
3,VTech usually does better than this,"Two key flaws:1. No indication (on either base or handset) when someone else is using a phone line -- many phones will show ""Extension in Use"" or light up the button for that line.2. In the middle of a call, you hear a brief dialtone as, presumably, it takes the other line ""off-hook"" to listen for the stutter dial tone representing an unheard voice mail message (so the 2931 can light up). As a previous fan of VTech who bought this phone over Uniden and Panasonic, I'm disappointed and considering returning it."
2,Bad Customer Service,"I bought this phone, absolutely loved it, but when it was just over a year old (just out of warranty), I broke the belt clip. Called V-Tech, they said they couldn't get a clip for it any more. I asked to be bumped up to a supervisor, who nicely said that they were just on order, not in stock, and would I like two when they got them in? I said yes, but two months later when I called, even though they have a record of me as a customer in their system (located by phone number), they had NO RECORD of the previous conversation, and again told me that the belt clip was no longer available.Nice phone, but I will NEVER order another V-Tech product, because of poor customer service, and being lied to. I have three of their phones, one now has a display that is funky, another has sticking keys. I will eventually replace them with ANY brand except V-Tech, and them write them a letter, telling them why."
2,Ok phone with poor usebility,"This phone is just ok, but has some major usebility flaws. Top 2 are:1. No way to switch from handheld call to speakerphone without major feedack.2. Most annoying is when you are on line 1, and line 2 rings, and rings LOUD in your ear, and your voice is muter to ther person on the other end at the same time. I don't know about everyone else, but this is a business phone to me, and when it sounds like I have call-waiting to my customer on the other end, it's amateur hour.Only problem is I bought this phone after I returned a 2-line cordless Panisonic with similiar issues.It's like wating for Gadot. Hopefully I'll find the perfect 2-line cordless phone someday; I'm not holding my breath."
2,2 Line not as Good as Single Line,"As a satisfied owner of VTech' single line phone I was surprised to find the programing and caller ID retrieval functions far more complicated on the 2 Line phone. Another feature lacking on the ""new"" 2 line phone is the ability of the phone to recognize which line is ringing and automatically pick of that line when the handset is removed from the base. My 10 year old AT & T 2 line phone does this and I miss it."
2,I'm suprised they still sell this phone,in Office Max and Staples. Brought mine before I came across these reviews. The message and call light were cute features. Very convenient. But the volume was too low whenever I added a headset. And the phone kept searching for channels whenever I went to the other end of the house (30 ft away). I'm returning it this afternoon for a better model.
